50|$|Three BL 13.5 inch /45 Mark V guns, named Gladiator, Piece Maker and <b>Scene</b> <b>Shifter,</b> were {{mounted on}} railway chassis during World War II {{for use as}} railway guns. <b>Scene</b> <b>Shifter</b> re-used a railway truck which had carried a BL 14 inch Railway Gun in the First World War. In 1940 these guns were issued to the Royal Marine Siege Regiment at Dover in Kent to bombard German {{batteries}} and shipping in the Calais area. They could be stored in railway tunnels {{when not in use}} to protect them from attack.|$|E
50|$|The {{guns were}} later joined by Lydden Spout Battery, {{consisting}} of three more BL 6-inch Mk VII guns. Also, three BL 13.5-inch (343 mm) Mk V naval guns from the First World War (named Gladiator, <b>Scene</b> <b>Shifter</b> and Piece Makersic) were brought {{out of retirement}} in 1939 and mounted on railway chassis.|$|E
5000|$|... 14 inch {{was not a}} {{standard}} British service calibre and hence it was impractical to keep the guns in service after World War I ended. The guns were declared obsolete in 1926 and scrapped. In 1940 the railway carriages were re-used: <b>Scene</b> <b>Shifter's</b> for mounting a 13.5 inch gun and Boche Buster's for an 18 in howitzer, for home defence in Britain.|$|R
60|$|The audience, surmising {{that they}} viewed a comedy {{instead of a}} tragedy in which the {{principals}} were married or reconciled, applauded with great enjoyment. The Cool Head, who always graces such occasions, rang the curtain down, and two platoons of <b>scene</b> <b>shifters</b> respectively and more or less respectfully removed Hart & Cherry from the stage. The next turn went on, and all went as merry as an alimony bell.|$|R
60|$|While {{this act}} of the drama was being presented, the <b>scene</b> <b>shifters</b> had been busy at the duties that had been {{assigned}} to them. Two of Cruz's dragoons had seized the bridle reins of Losada's horses; others formed a close guard around the carriage; and they galloped off with the tyrant and his two unpopular Ministers. No doubt a place had been prepared for them. There are a number of well-barred stone apartments in Coralio.|$|R
50|$|In the 1989 {{version with}} Robert Englund, the chief <b>scene</b> <b>shifter,</b> Joseph Buquet, is found skinned alive and hanging in La Carlotta's closet. As with the {{previous}} film versions, it is not mentioned {{whether or not it}} is from the Punjab lasso. In one scene the Phantom uses a whip to protect himself from robbers.|$|E
50|$|Sherwin {{began his}} career in the theatre and worked as a junior set designer, scenic artist, <b>scene</b> <b>shifter,</b> stage manager and {{lighting}} designer. He also spent two years of National Service in the Royal Air Force. Following this, Sherwin established himself as an actor in theatre, films and television. While still working as an actor, Sherwin also began work as a freelance writer, contributing scripts to series such as Crossroads and Z-Cars.|$|E
50|$|Eager {{to obtain}} more education, {{he tried to}} enter Brown University, but was denied admission. After {{appealing}} directly {{to the president of}} the university, his entrance to the school was arranged. McCarthy lacked the funds to pay for school, so he financed his education by working as a <b>scene</b> <b>shifter</b> and painter in theaters in Providence. He also played for the Brown football team, earning All-America honors. He graduated from Brown in 1896, with a bachelor of philosophy degree.|$|E
5000|$|Along {{with his}} friends the critic Alexander Woollcott, writer Dorothy Parker and humorist Robert Benchley, Broun {{was a member of}} the famed Algonquin Round Table from 1919 to 1929, where his usually dishevelled {{appearance}} led to him being likened to [...] "an unmade bed." [...] He was also close friends with the Marx Brothers, and attended their show The Cocoanuts more than 20 times. Broun joked that his tombstone would read, [...] "killed by getting in the way of some <b>scene</b> <b>shifters</b> at a Marx Brothers show." ...|$|R
5000|$|Crowley {{described}} Morgan as {{an essential}} part of the Playhouse: [...] Agnes Morgan's apprentices were the stage crew, a neighborhood corps of assistant property boys, <b>scene</b> <b>shifters,</b> and painters But her technical facility was such that she was everywhere in the theatre, combining a collection of functions the mere mention of which would drive any [...] "self-respecting" [...] member of the theatre union of today into a decline. Skilled as an actor, she played an occasional role; she developed the technical side of lighting, and had an instinctive gift for direction, as for the function of stage manager. As an amateur she responded to any production need while pursuing her professional career as playwright.|$|R
60|$|It {{was felt}} {{that it would be}} better to have a new play than an old. We {{selected}} a brilliant little modern drawing-room comedy never yet presented. The owner of the copyright, a theatrical firm, let us use it for a merely nominal fee of two hundred dollars, including the sole right to play the piece forever. There being only twenty-eight characters in it, it was felt to be more suitable than a more ambitious thing. The tickets were placed at one dollar, no one being admitted free except the performers themselves, and the members who very kindly acted as <b>scene</b> <b>shifters,</b> curtain lifters, ushers, door-keepers, programme sellers, and the general committee of management. All the performers, at their own suggestion, supplied their own costumes, charging nothing to the club except the material and the cost of dressmaking. Beyond this there was no expense except for the fee, very reasonable, of Mr. Skip, the professional coach who trained the performers, and who asked us, in view of the circumstances, less than half of what he would have been willing to accept.|$|R

5000|$|Like many boxers, Matthews {{worked in}} the {{entertainment}} industry in his retirement, and once entertained audiences riding a diving horse into a tank at the New York Hippodrome. He worked in several capacities at the Hippodrome including Doorman as late as 1923. He worked briefly as a traveling stage actor after winning the welterweight championship. [...] In his later years he worked as a <b>scene</b> <b>shifter</b> in theaters. [...] At 70 in 1944, he was an official of the Theatrical Carpenter's Union, and a foreman of carpenters for a New York theatrical chain. His long life may partially be explained by rarely having overindulged in alcohol according to several sources, though he was known to on occasion smoke a pipe. He was not reported to have fallen victim to a gambling habit like many successful boxers.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was born}} Wilhelm Dieterle in Ludwigshafen, the {{youngest}} child of nine, to Jacob and Berthe (Doerr) Dieterle. As a child, {{he lived in}} considerable poverty and earned money by various means including carpentry and as a scrap dealer. He became interested in theater early and would stage productions in the family barn for friends and family. At the age of sixteen he had joined a traveling theater company as a handy-man, <b>scene</b> <b>shifter</b> and apprentice actor. His striking good looks and ambition soon paved the way as a leading romantic actor in theater productions. In 1919, he {{attracted the attention of}} Max Reinhardt in Berlin who hired him as an actor for his productions until 1924. He started acting in German films in 1921 to make more money and quickly became a popular character actor. He usually portrayed [...] "country yokels" [...] or simpletons with great gusto and popularity, but he was ambitious to begin a career as a director. In 1921 Dieterle married Charlotte Hagenbruch, an actress and later screenwriter.|$|E
2500|$|The stage {{itself had}} all the latest {{technological}} features.

[...] Additionally, speaking tubes and bell signals connected the stage manager with the box office, orchestra, and <b>scene</b> and trap <b>shifters.</b> [...] The stage's collection of scenic backdrops was exhaustive and of the highest quality, and was a third larger than the Kalamazoo Opera House.|$|R
50|$|While in {{his early}} 20s, Spangler trained as a carpenter. He {{eventually}} moved to Maryland and began working with another carpenter, James Johnson Gifford. In the early 1850s, Spangler and Gifford helped to construct Tudor Hall, the summer retreat for the Booth family. It was during this time that Spangler met future stage actor John Wilkes Booth who was then a child. In 1853, Spangler moved to Baltimore where he worked {{as an assistant to}} Gifford at the Front Street and Holliday Street Theaters. In 1858, Spangler married Mary Brasheare. In 1861, the couple relocated to Washington, D.C. where Spangler began working as a carpenter and <b>scene</b> <b>shifter</b> at Ford's Theatre. It was while working at Ford's Theatre that Spangler became reacquainted with John Wilkes Booth. By that time, Booth had become a renowned and popular stage actor. Spangler was dazzled by Booth's fame and charm and, despite the fact that Booth was thirteen years Spangler's junior, was always eager to complete whatever tasks Booth assigned him. Like Booth, Spangler opposed the abolition of slavery and considered himself a Secessionist. He would often butt heads with co-worker Jake Rittersbach who was a veteran of the Union Army.|$|E
5000|$|I {{was born}} in York County, Pennsylvania, and am about forty-three years of age, I am a house {{carpenter}} by trade, and became acquainted with J. Wilkes Booth when a boy. I worked for his father in building a cottage in Harford County, Maryland, in 1854.... I have acted as <b>scene</b> <b>shifter</b> in Ford's Theater, ever since it was first opened up, to {{the night of the}} assassination of President Lincoln. During the winter of A. D. 1862 and 1863, J. Wilkes Booth played a star engagement at Ford's Theater for two weeks. At that time I saw him and conversed with him quite frequently. After completing his engagement he left Washington and I did not see him again until the winters of A. D. 1864 and 1865. I then saw him at various times in and about Ford's Theater. Booth had free access to the theater at all times, and made himself very familiar with all persons connected with it. He had a stable {{in the rear of the}} theater where he kept his horses. A boy, Joseph Burroughs, commonly called 'Peanut John,' took care of them whenever Booth was absent from the city. I looked after his horses, which I did at his request, and saw that they were properly cared for. Booth promised to pay me for my trouble, but he never did. I frequently had the horses exercised, during Booth's absence from the city, by 'Peanut John,' walking them up and down the alley. 'Peanut John' kept the key to the stable in the theater, hanging upon a nail behind the small door, which opened into the alley at the rear of the theater.Booth usually rode out on horseback every afternoon and evening, but seldom remained out later than eight or nine o'clock. He always went and returned alone. I never knew of his riding out on horseback and staying out all night, or of any person coming to the stable with him, or calling there for him. He had two horses at the stable, only a short time. He brought them there some time in the month of December. A man called George and myself repaired and fixed the stable for him. I usually saddled the horse for him when 'Peanut John' was absent. About the first of March Booth brought another horse and a buggy and harness to the stable, but in what manner I do not know; after that he used to ride out with his horse and buggy, and I frequently harnessed them up for him. I never saw any person ride out with him or return with him from these rides.On the Monday evening previous to the assassination, Booth requested me to sell the horse, harness, and buggy, as he said he should leave the city soon. I took them the next morning to the horse market, and had them put up at auction, with the instruction not to sell unless they would net two hundred and sixty dollars; this was in accordance with Booth's orders to me. As no person bid sufficient to make them net that amount, they were not sold, and I took them back to the stable. I informed Booth of the result that same evening in front of the theater. He replied that he must then try and have them sold at private sale, and asked me if I would help him. I replied, 'Yes.' This was about six o'clock in the evening, and the conversation took place in the presence of John F. Sleichman and others. The next day I sold them for two hundred and sixty dollars. The purchaser accompanied me to the theater. Booth was not in, and the money was paid to James J. Gifford, who receipted for it. I did not see Booth to speak to him, after the sale, until the evening of the assassination.Upon the afternoon of April 14 I was told by 'Peanut John' that the President and General Grant were coming to the theater that night, and that I must take out the partition in the President's box. It was my business to do all such work. I was assisted in doing it by Rittespaugh and 'Peanut John.' In the evening, between five and six o'clock, Booth came into the theater and asked me for a halter. I was very busy at work at the time on the stage preparatory to the evening performance, and Rittespaugh went upstairs and brought one down. I went out to the stable with Booth and put the halter upon the horse. I commenced to take off the saddle when Booth said, 'Never mind, I do not want it off, but let it and the bridle remain.' He afterward took the saddle off himself, locked the stable, and went back to the theater.Booth, Maddox, 'Peanut John,' and myself immediately went out of the theater to the adjoining restaurant next door, and took a drink at Booth's expense. I then went immediately back to the theatre, and Rittespaugh and myself went to supper. I did not see Booth again until between nine and ten o'clock. About that time Deboney called to me, and said Booth wanted me to hold his horse as soon as I could be spared. I went to the back door and Booth was standing in the alley holding a horse by the bridle rein, and requested me to hold it. I took the rein, but told him I could not remain, as Gifford was gone, and that all of the responsibility rested on me. Booth then passed into the theater. I called to Deboney to send 'Peanut John' to hold the horse. He came, and took the horse, and I went back to my proper place.In about a half hour afterward I heard a shot fired, and immediately saw a man run across the stage. I saw him as he passed by the center door of the scenery, behind which I then stood; this door is usually termed the center chamber door. I did not recognize the man as he crossed the stage as being Booth. I then heard some one say that the President was shot. Immediately all was confusion. I shoved the scenes back as quickly as possible in order to clear the stage, as many were rushing upon it. I was very much frightened, as I heard persons halloo, [...] "Burn the theater!" [...] I did not see Booth pass out; my situation was such that I could not see any person pass out of the back door. The back door has a spring attached to it, and would not shut of its own accord. I usually slept in the theater, but I did not upon the night of the assassination; I was fearful the theater would be burned, and I slept in a carpenter's shop adjoining.I never heard Booth express himself in favor of the rebellion, or opposed to the Government, or converse upon political subjects; and I have no recollection of his mentioning the name of President Lincoln in any connection whatever. I know nothing of the mortise hole said to be in the wall behind the door of the President's box, or of any wooden bar to fasten or hold the door being there, or of the lock being out of order. I did not notice any hole in the door. Gifford usually attended to the carpentering in the front part of the theater, while I did the work about the stage. Mr. Gifford was the boss carpenter, and I was under him.|$|E
