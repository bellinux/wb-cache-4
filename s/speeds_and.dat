40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine the criterion validity of EAS 4 visual <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> accuracy test. Score of EAS 4 visual <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> accuracy test was correlated with score of clerical <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> accuracy test from differential aptitude test (DAT) battery. The subjects of this research were 87 students of the Faculty of Psychology Ahmad Dahlan University. The data were obtained through EAS 4 visual <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> accuracy test <b>and</b> clerical <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> accuracy test (D 4). Quantitative analysis was done by SPSS version 15 software. Product moment's correlation analysis was used to test the relationship between score of EAS 4 visual <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> accuracy test and score of clerical <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> accuracy test (D 4). The result of this research shows that there was a significant correlation (r= 0, 591; p= 0, 000) between score of EAS 4 visual <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> accuracy test and score of clerical <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> accuracy test (D 4). It means that EAS 4 visual <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> accuracy test had good criterion validity to measure perceptual ability. </em...|$|R

Many researchers were of the opinion that Plateosaurus could use both quadrupedal gaits (for slow <b>speeds)</b> <b>and</b> bipedal gaits (for rapid locomotion), and Wellnhofer insisted that the tail curved strongly downward, making a bipedal posture impossible.

The rudder was augmented with special steering system on the engine transmissions; they had gears that could drive half of the engines astern and half forward allowed the screws to assist in turning the ship at sharper angles.
