40|$|A new {{monolithic}} integrated {{high side}} current sense principle is developed and investigated for power semiconductor devices with lateral and vertical current flow. In such devices the well-known low side sense principles are unsuitable. The special {{requirements for the}} integration and the signal processing are discussed in detail. As an example, the new concept is presented with a lateral-vertical transistor (LV-transistor). The load current enters the device {{on the top of}} the chip and it is divided to flow to a vertical and lateral main contact. The current distribution in the device depends on the device layout and the operating point. The usual integrated low side current sense principle consists of a current mirror and a sense resistor in the current path. Therefore, only the lateral current component in the LV-transistor could be detected. Especially in the case of turning off the device and simultaneous current control the <b>sense</b> <b>signal</b> will be ambiguous. In the new concept the sense resistor is directly connected to the high voltage side in the load current path, so that the relation between the <b>sense</b> <b>signal</b> and the load current is almost independent of the device parameters. The new current sense concept allows the detection of the current level and makes the current control in a lateral-vertical power switch possible. This is investigated and demonstrated by a test structure of an LV-transistor under ohmic load and an external control system. The temperature and voltage dependence of the <b>sense</b> <b>signal</b> is simulated and measured to define the demands for the subsequent circuitry. For a simple MOS-transistor the results are compared with the behaviour of the low side current sense principle in the case of detecting a current flag. However, it is a disadvantage of the concept, that the <b>sense</b> <b>signal</b> must be transferred from the high voltage side to the low voltage side for further processing. The possibility of signal transfer by monolithic integrated high resistive polysilicon resistors on the RESURF-region is investigated by numeric simulation and measurement. The reactions of the integrated components on the breakdown behaviour of an LV-transistor are simulated and classified as uncritical in respect of the application. The disturbing effects on the <b>sense</b> <b>signal</b> are caused mainly by capacitive coupling between the power device and the high ohmic transfer resistors and determine the critical frequency of the system. Finally, some parasitic influences for the case of current control are analysed and the demands for the processing circuit are discussed. As a result, the fundamental problems of the high side sense principle are investigated for a special LV-device and appropriate solutions are proposed...|$|E

Despite their harmful potential, mechanisms that <b>sense,</b> <b>signal,</b> and suppress these structures remain elusive.

40|$|International audienceThe {{evolutionary}} history of plants is tightly {{connected with the}} evolution of microbial pathogens and herbivores, which use photosynthetic end products {{as a source of}} life. In these interactions, plants, as the stationary party, have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to <b>sense,</b> <b>signal</b> and respond to the presence of external stress agents. Chloroplasts are metabolically versatile organelles that carry out fundamental functions in determining appropriate immune reactions in plants. Besides photosynthesis, chloroplasts host key steps in the biosynthesis of amino acids, stress hormones and secondary metabolites, which have a great impact on resistance against pathogens and insect herbivores. Changes in chloroplast redox signalling pathways and reactive oxygen species metabolism also mediate local and systemic signals, which modulate plant resistance to light stress and disease. Moreover, interplay among chloroplastic signalling networks and plasma membrane receptor kinases is emerging as a key mechanism that modulates stress responses in plants. This review highlights the central role of chloroplasts in the signalling crosstalk that essentially determines the outcome of plant-pathogen interactions in plants...|$|E

Resonant drive also offers a versatile solution for position sense and generates the <b>sense</b> <b>signal</b> using a single drive capacitor. Resonant drive uses the fact that the voltage across the capacitor of a series LC tank can be much higher than the input signal driving the tank. The amplification is maximum at resonance and equal to the quality factor (Q). The tank circuit consists of an external inductor and the MEMS drive capacitor. Since the input signal is amplified through the tank, low voltage electronics can fully implement the drive function. As the actuator gap closes, resonance frequency of the tank decreases. This fiequency shift is used for measuring the position. Resonant drive has been successfully demonstrated using torsional MEMS mirrors that require lOOV for 20 deg-optical rotation.

In the latter case, environment becomes favorable for proliferation of microorganisms [1] which then causes inflammation.

There are trillion of bacteria on the human gut and this microbiota population depends on nutritional status of the subjects. A healthy nutrition thus promote healthy microflora and vice versa.

40|$|AbstractCells can <b>sense,</b> <b>signal,</b> and {{organize}} via mechanical forces. The ability of cells to mechanically sense {{and respond to}} the presence of other cells over relatively long distances (e. g., ∼ 100 μm, or ∼ 10 cell-diameters) across extracellular matrix (ECM) has been attributed to the strain-hardening behavior of the ECM. In this study, we explore an alternative hypothesis: the fibrous nature of the ECM makes long-range stress transmission possible and provides an important mechanism for long-range cell-cell mechanical signaling. To test this hypothesis, confocal reflectance microscopy was used to develop image-based finite-element models of stress transmission within fibroblast-seeded collagen gels. Models that account for the gel’s fibrous nature were compared with homogenous linear-elastic and strain-hardening models to investigate the mechanisms of stress propagation. Experimentally, cells were observed to compact the collagen gel and align collagen fibers between neighboring cells within 24 h. Finite-element analysis revealed that stresses generated by a centripetally contracting cell boundary are concentrated in the relatively stiff ECM fibers and are propagated farther in a fibrous matrix as compared to homogeneous linear elastic or strain-hardening materials. These results support the hypothesis that ECM fibers, especially aligned ones, {{play an important role in}} long-range stress transmission...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, major {{advances}} {{have been made}} in our understanding of how plants <b>sense,</b> <b>signal,</b> and respond to soil phosphorus (P) availability (Amtmann et al., 2006; White and Hammond, 2008; Nilsson et al., 2010; Yang and Finnegan, 2010; Vance, 2010; George et al., 2011). Previously, we have reviewed the potential for shoot-derived carbohydrate signals to initiate acclimatory responses in roots to low P availability. In this context, these carbohydrates act as systemic plant growth regulators (Hammond and White, 2008). Photosynthate is transported primarily to sink tissues as Suc via the phloem. Under P starvation, plants accumulate sugars and starch in their leaves. Increased loading of Suc to the phloem under P starvation primarily functions to relocate carbon resources to the roots, which increases their size relative to the shoot (Hermans et al., 2006). The translocation of sugars via the phloem also has the potential to initiate sugar signaling cascades that alter the expression of genes involved plant responses to low P availability. These include optimizing root biochemistry to acquire soil P, through increased expression and activity of inorganic phosphate (Pi) transporters, the secretion of acid phosphatases and organic acids to release P from the soil, and the optimization of internal P use (Hammond and White, 2008). Here, we provide an Update to the field of plant signaling responses to low P availability and the interactions with sugar signaling components. Advances in the P signaling pathways and the roles of hormones in signaling plant responses to low P availability are also reviewed, and where possible their interactions with potential sugar signaling pathways...|$|E

40|$|The laser Doppler {{interferometer}} {{reported here}} {{was developed to}} investigate the possibilities of remote vibration and motion measurements. The method is noncontacting and operates with unprepared targets, using the diffusely scattered light to measure the axial component of the motion. A full description of the motion requires both magnitude {{and direction of the}} target motion. The magnitude was found by standard heterodyning techniques, mixing light scattered from the target with a part of the original laser output in a controlled manner. A phase quadrature method was used to identify the direction of the target. This differs from the more usual method of frequency offsetting in requiring only passive optical components and therefore being considerably cheaper. This feature is believed to be novel to the LDI reported here. Measurements were recorded for target motions over the range 100 mm. to (c.) 1 um. Because unprepared and therefore optically rough targets were used the light received by the detectors was not well behaved. This resulted in instability of the sense of motion signal due to loss of either of the detector signals for displacements above 500 um. However this should not be considered an upper limit to the range of the LDI, as serious loss of the <b>sense</b> <b>signal</b> was rare up to (c.) 25 mm. and measurements were made up to a peak displacement of 200 mm. Correlations with an accelerometer and an LVDT show that the LDI can reliably measure displacement up to a range of 25 mm. with a maximum target velocity of 32 mm/s limited currently be the signal processing. Theoretical resolution with this device is better than 0. 08 um. if full use is made of both detected signals. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{multi-channel}} electrometer voltmeter {{that employs}} self-nulling lock-in detection electronics {{in conjunction with}} a mechanical resonator with noncontact voltage sensing electrodes has been developed for space-based measurement of an Internal Electrostatic Discharge Monitor (IESDM). The IESDM is new sensor technology targeted for integration into a Space Environmental Monitor (SEM) subsystem used for the characterization and monitoring of deep dielectric charging on spacecraft. Use of an AC-coupled lock-in amplifier with closed-loop sense-signal nulling via generation of an active guard-driving feedback voltage provides the resolution, accuracy, linearity and stability needed for long-term space-based measurement of the IESDM. This implementation relies on adjusting the feedback voltage to drive the sense current received from the resonator s variable-capacitance-probe voltage transducer to approximately zero, as limited by the signal-to-noise performance of the loop electronics. The magnitude of the sense current is proportional to the difference between the input voltage being measured and the feedback voltage, which matches the input voltage when the sense current is zero. High signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is achieved by synchronous detection of the <b>sense</b> <b>signal</b> using the correlated reference signal derived from the oscillator circuit that drives the mechanical resonator. The magnitude of the feedback voltage, while the loop is in a settled state with essentially zero sense current, is an accurate estimate of the input voltage being measured. This technique has many beneficial attributes including immunity to drift, high linearity, high SNR from synchronous detection of a single-frequency carrier selected to avoid potentially noisy 1 /f low-frequency spectrum of the signal-chain electronics, and high accuracy provided through the benefits of a driven shield encasing the capacitance- probe transducer and guarded input triaxial lead-in. Measurements obtained from a 2 - channel prototype electrometer have demonstrated good accuracy (|error| < 0. 2 V) and high stability.

40|$|Bacteria use quorum sensing, a cell to cell {{signaling}} mechanism mediated by small molecules that {{are produced by}} specific signal molecule synthases, to regulate gene expression in response to population density. In Vibrio anguillarum, the quorum-sensing phosphorelay channels information from three hybrid sensor kinases VanN, VanQ, CqsS that <b>sense</b> <b>signal</b> molecules produced by the synthases VanM, VanS and CqsA, onto the phosphotransferase VanU, to regulate activity of the response regulator VanO. VanO activates transcription of quorum-sensing regulatory RNAs (Qrr), which work together with the RNA chaperone Hfq to repress expression of the transcriptional regulator VanT. The work presented in this thesis characterizes quorum-sensing independent and quorum-sensing dependent mechanisms that regulate VanT expression. Moreover, an in vivo imaging system was established, {{as a means to}} study V. anguillarum infections in the rainbow trout infection model. Two quorum-sensing independent mechanisms regulating VanT expression were identified. First, the sigma factor RpoS indirectly activates VanT expression during transition into stationary growth phase by inhibiting hfq expression. Both, RpoS and VanT are crucial for stress response. Second, a type VI secretion system (T 6 SS) has a novel function as a signal sensing mechanism to regulate rpoS and vanT expression. Consequently, RpoS, quorum sensing and T 6 SS form a global network that senses stress and modulates stress response to ensure survival of the bacteria. Further analysis of the quorum-sensing dependent regulation of VanT expression by the phosphorelay system revealed that four qrr genes are expressed continuously during growth. The phosphotransferase VanU is suggested to activate two response regulators, VanO and a predicted second response regulator. Activated VanO induces expression of the Qrr sRNAs, whereas, the predicted response regulator represses expression of the Qrr sRNAs. Thus, VanU has a pivotal role in the regulation of VanT expression. The signal synthase VanM and VanT form a regulatory loop, in which VanM represses VanT by inducing expression of the Qrr sRNAs and VanT directly activates vanM expression to repress its own expression. Moreover, Hfq destabilizes vanM mRNA, repressing vanM expression. VanT forms another regulatory loop with the transcriptional regulator LuxT, in which LuxT activates vanT expression and VanT directly represses luxT expression. V. anguillarum is an opportunistic pathogen that causes vibriosis, a terminal hemorrhagic septicemia. The spatial and temporal progression of the infection was analyzed using the whole animal with an in vivo bioluminescent imaging method.
