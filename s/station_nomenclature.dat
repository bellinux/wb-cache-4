40|$|Observations {{of extreme}} spatial rates of change of ionospheric {{electron}} {{content and the}} characterization strategy for mitigation applied by the U. S. local area augmentation system are shown. During extreme ionospheric activity, the gradient suffered by a global navigation satellite system user a few kilometers away from a ground reference station may reach as high as 425 mm of delay (at the GPS L 1 frequency) per km of user separation. The method of data analysis that produced these results is described, and a threat space that parameterizes these possible threats to user integrity is defined. Certain configurations of user, reference station, global navigation satellite system satellite, and ionospheric storm-enhanced density may inhibit detection of the anomalous ionosphere by the reference <b>station.</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> B = satellite clock bias, m b = receiver clock bias, m D = ionospheric threat model maximum ionospheric delay, m f 1 = 1575. 42 MHz, GPS L 1 frequency f 2 = 1227. 60 MHz, GPS L 2 frequency g = spatial rate of change of ionospheric delay, also known as slope or gradient, mm=k...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The normal {{pathways}} of lymphatic drainage {{from the}} abdominal organs {{have been well}} described in the classic anatomy literature. Knowledge of the location and nomenclature of the common nodal stations in the abdomen are essential for complete report of radiological findings. CT is ubiquitous {{in the evaluation of}} oncology patients. Utilizing colour-coded CT images of the abdomen we will present the nomenclature and location of the nodal stations for common abdominal neoplasms, including those of the stomach, pancreas, liver, colon and the kidney. Understanding the nomenclature and the usual lymphatic pathways of metastasis will help radiologists detect disease spread from abdominal tumours. The goal of this pictorial review is to present the nodal <b>stations,</b> <b>nomenclature</b> and location of regional lymph nodes for the most common abdominal neoplasms. In addition, the reader can use this document as a handbook to learn and review this information...|$|R

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element}} model (FEM) is used with a Lagrangian particle transport (LPT) technique to simulate contaminant transport for emergency response. A three dimensional computational mesh is first generated using USGS Digital Elevation Map (DEM) data. An initial wind velocity is then calculated from the meteorological data using objective analysis technology. The 3 -D {{finite element model}} is used to construct the mass-consistent wind field over irregular terrain. The LPT employs a stochastic/random walk approach to generate the contaminant transport traces. The model runs on PCs and is well suited for use in dealing with emergency response dispersion predictions and assessment. Simulation results utilizing Las Vegas fire <b>stations</b> are presented. <b>Nomenclature</b> D = Deterministic forcing function rn = Normally distributed random number ',tt = Time U = Mean velocity wvu,, = Velocity in x, y, z directio...|$|R
40|$|The Tilt-Rotor Aeroacoustic Model (TRAM) {{test in the}} Duitse-Nederlandse Wind (DNW) Tunnel {{acquired}} blade pressure {{data for}} forward flight test conditions of a tiltrotor in helicopter mode. Chordwise pressure data at seven radial locations were integrated to obtain the blade section normal force. The present investigation evaluates the use of linear regression analysis and of neural networks in estimating the blade section normal force coefficient from {{a limited number of}} blade leading-edge pressure measurements and representative operating conditions. These network models are subsequently used to estimate the airloads at intermediate radial locations where only blade pressure measurements at the 3. 5 % chordwise <b>stations</b> are available. <b>Nomenclature</b> a speed of sound A rotor disk area, πR 2 c local blade chord cref blade reference chord cn blade section normal force coefficient, N/(1 / 2 ρU 2 c) cp pressure coefficient, p/(1 / 2 ρU 2) CT rotor thrust coefficient, T/ρ(ΩR) 2 A (shaft axes) M Mach number Mtip blade tip Mach number, ΩR/a nn neural network p local blade pressure r blade radial station (0 to R) R blade radius U local velocity V free stream velocity; wind tunnel spee...|$|R
