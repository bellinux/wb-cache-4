40|$|Abstract Background Injuries in {{or around}} the home are the most {{important}} cause of death among children aged 0 - 4 years old. It is also a major source of morbidity and loss of quality of life. In order {{to reduce the number of}} injuries, the Consumer Safety Institute introduced the use of <b>Safety</b> <b>Information</b> Leaflets in the Netherlands to provide safety education to parents of children aged 0 - 4 years. Despite current safety education, necessary safety behaviours are still not taken by a large number of parents, causing unnecessary risk of injury among young children. In an earlier study an E-health module with internet-based, tailored <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> was developed and applied. It concerns an advice for parents on safety behaviours in their homes regarding their child. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of this <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> combined with personal counselling on parents' child safety behaviours. Methods/Design Parents who are eligible for the regular well-child visit with their child at child age 5 - 8 months are invited to participate in this study. Participating parents are randomized into one of two groups: 1) internet-based, tailored <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> combined with personal counselling (intervention group), or 2) personal counselling using the <b>Safety</b> <b>Information</b> Leaflets of the Consumer Safety Institute in the Netherlands for children aged 12 to 24 months (control group). All parents receive <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> on <b>safety</b> topics regarding the prevention of falling, poisoning, drowning and burning. Parents of the intervention group will access the internet-based, tailored <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> module when their child is approximately 10 months old. After completion of the assessment questions, the program compiles a tailored safety advice. The parents are asked to devise and inscribe a personal implementation intention.

The aim {{of the present study}} is to understand the differences in the volume and content of <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> on the drug labels from the same manufacturers in three developed countries: the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada. This study involved the calculation of the proportion of total <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> (PSI) and of contraindications (PCI) in comparison to all information on the label and the percentage of boxed warnings (PBW) among the 100 labels studied from each country. The PSI on the labels of different countries is different with USA labels bearing lesser value PSI and UK labels bearing higher value PSI. The qualitative information provided on these drug labels from each country in â€˜contraindicationsâ€™ sections, â€˜boxed/serious warningsâ€™ and â€˜overdosageâ€™ sections presented differences in the information provided on most of the labels. We have found distinct differences between the <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> available on drug labels in terms of volume and content.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of trust in food <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> in {{determining}} consumer choice in relation to socio-demographic effects and other determinants. The complexity of factors influencing the way a consumer processes food <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> {{makes it difficult to}} develop adequate risk communication strategies. This is, however, a priority for current European policy and this paper tries to answer some key questions: (1) can the consumer be segmented into socio-demographic groups in relation to their trust in food <b>safety</b> <b>information?</b> (2) are country and cultural differences relevant in the way food <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> is processed? (3) how do risk perception and trust in food <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> influence food choice in relation to other determinants? (4) How does a food scare alter the weight of these determinants? (5) How do information sources differ in terms of how they impact on consumers risk perception and behaviours? To provide some answers to the above questions, we propose a modelling framework which extends the Theory of Planned Behaviour to account for risk perception and trust and allows for country-specific effects. The model is tested on the impact of salmonella information on chicken consumption choices across five European countries, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and the United Kingdom, based on a nationally representative survey for a total of 2725 face-to-face interviews. Results show that although no relationship emerges between socio-demographics variables and the trust placed by consumer in food <b>safety</b> <b>information,</b> although country differences are relevant. The findings also suggest that the policy priority should be on building and maintaining trust in food and health authorities, and research institutions. food <b>safety</b> <b>information,</b> trust, risk perception, Theory of Planned Behaviour, chicken, Consumer/Household Economics, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R

40|$|Occupational driving crashes are {{the most}} common cause of death and injury in the workplace. The {{physical}} and psychological outcomes following injury are also very costly to organizations. Thus, safe driving poses a managerial challenge. Some research has attempted to address this issue through modifying discrete and often simple target behaviors (e. g., driver training programs). However, current intervention approaches in the occupational driving field generally do not consider the role of organizational factors in workplace safety. This study adopts the A-B-C framework to identify the contingencies associated with an effective exchange of <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> within the occupational driving context. Utilizing a sample of occupational drivers and their supervisors, this multi-level study examines the contingencies associated with the exchange of <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> within the supervisor-driver relationship. Safety values are identified as an antecedent of the <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> exchange, and the quality of the leader-member exchange relationship and safe driving performance is identified as the behavioral consequences. We also examine the function of role overload as a factor influencing the relationship between safety values and the <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> exchange. Hierarchical Linear Modelling found that role overload moderated the relationship between supervisorsâ€™ perceptions of the value given to safety and the <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> exchange. A significant relationship was also found between the <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> exchange and the subsequent quality of the leader-member exchange relationship. Finally, the quality of the leader-member exchange relationship was found to be significantly associated with safe driving performance.

Abstract: Background: There is an increase of over-the-counter (OTC) herbal products for use in diabetes mellitus [...] The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> provided with OTC herbal remedies intended for diabetic patients in Sri Lanka and to assess the completeness of the information provided. Methods: Inclusion criteria consisted of OTC herbal remedies meant for use in diabetes. They were bought from local Sri Lankan super markets and non-Ayurvedic pharmacies and product information regarding the risk of hypoglycaemia, precautions for use, adverse events, dose and interactions were assessed using a scoring system. The accuracy of the information was then compared against published data. Results: Eleven products fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Five products contained a single constituent and 5 contained more than one. None had complete and accurate <b>safety</b> <b>information</b> according to our criteria. None specifically warned against the risk of hypoglycaemia. Nine out of eleven products (81. 8 %) carried <= 3 items of the 5 essential factual information we expected.
