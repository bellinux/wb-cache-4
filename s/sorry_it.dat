500|$|From the {{beginning}} of the project, Feuer and Martin wanted Henry Fonda to play Doc. The actor put in months of lessons in an attempt to bring his voice up to standard. Fonda later stated {{that at the end of}} six months of singing lessons, he [...] "still couldn't sing for shit". Following his first audition for Rodgers, Fonda asked the composer for his honest view, and Rodgers stated, [...] "I'm <b>sorry,</b> <b>it</b> would be a mistake." ...|$|E
2500|$|Leak to {{the news}} media {{regarding}} Richard Jewell that led to the widespread and incorrect presumption of his guilt in the Centennial Olympic Park bombing.

2500|$|I {{was going}} through all the {{elements}} in the show I've presented & I realize it's not a positive show & it shouldn't fool anybody, saying 'oh yes, if we all recycle our cans, & separate our plastics & fucking separate our paper {{the world will be}} so great'. But it's 'no, I am <b>sorry,</b> <b>it</b> just doesn't work out that way".|$|E
2500|$|DiFranco {{issued an}} apology on January 2, 2014 {{following}} continued criticism. [...] In it, she wrote [...] "..i {{would like to}} say i am sincerely <b>sorry.</b> <b>it</b> is obvious to me now that you were right - all those who said we can't in good conscience go to that place and support it or look past for one moment what it deeply represents. i needed a wake up call and you gave it to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Those {{defending}} Moyles {{have noted}} that Aled Haydn Jones, his show's producer {{who has worked with}} Moyles since 2001, is openly gay. He was quoted in The Guardian by Stonewall chief executive Ben Summerskill as saying [...] "Yeah, I'm homophobic, I don't like the gays. <b>Sorry,</b> <b>it</b> just does my head in. We have a token gay on the show!" [...] In his book The Difficult Second Book, Moyles says that he was responding to another article with sarcasm, and was subsequently quoted out of context.|$|E

2500|$|When {{you lose}} your {{confidence}} you don't want to bowl again. When I went on the West Indies tour I had no confidence, even though I got 17 wickets {{at an average of}} about 25, and 10 of them were in first-class games. I only bowled about 78 overs on tour. When {{you lose your}} confidence it's not a nice feeling – you can't do what you used to do, but I'm only <b>sorry</b> <b>it</b> was the wrong day at the wrong time , because if I was myself, I assure you, in my opinion, I would have played more Test cricket, but that's only my assumption. I appreciated the experience , but after three months with no confidence [...] I was pleased to get back home.|$|E
2500|$|It's not ill-conceived to look {{at certain}} people and {{question}} {{when they come out}} here what they bring with them ... We have strict quarantine laws and it should be the same when it comes to cultures that do not want to integrate. We should be very careful about where certain Muslims come from and what they believe. If you come here, you should behave yourself – it's as simple as that... If people come and live in any country and their way of life is so different they need their own special laws, then possibly they have to pick somewhere else to live. The idea of any Muslim being photographed for a passport or a licence with one of those shrouds on – <b>sorry,</b> <b>it</b> just can't happen.|$|E
2500|$|For years afterwards, Frazier {{retained}} his bitterness towards Ali {{and suggested}} that Ali's battle with Parkinson's syndrome {{was a form of}} divine retribution for his earlier behavior. In 2001, Ali apologized to Frazier via a New York Times article, saying [...] "In a way, Joe's right. I said {{a lot of things in}} the heat of the moment that I shouldn't have said. Called him names I shouldn't have called him. I apologize for that. I'm <b>sorry.</b> <b>It</b> was all meant to promote the fight". Frazier reportedly [...] "embraced it", though he later retorted that Ali only apologized to a newspaper, not to him. He said: [...] "I'm still waiting [...] to say it to me." [...] To this Ali responded: [...] "If you see Frazier, you tell him he's still a gorilla." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1934, Olympic again {{struck a}} ship. The {{approaches}} to New York {{were marked by}} lightships and Olympic, like other liners, had been known to pass close by these vessels. On 15 May 1934, Olympic, inbound in heavy fog, was homing in on the radio beacon of Nantucket Lightship LV-117. Now {{under the command of}} Captain John Binks, the ship failed to turn in time and sliced through the smaller vessel, which broke apart and sank. Four of the lightship's crew went down with the vessel and seven were rescued, of whom three died of their injuries – thus there were seven fatalities out of a crew of eleven. The lightship's surviving crew and Olympics captain were interviewed soon after reaching shore. [...] One crewman said it all happened so quickly that they didn't know how it happened. [...] The captain was very <b>sorry</b> <b>it</b> happened but said Olympic reacted very quickly lowering boats to rescue the crew, which was confirmed by an injured crewman.|$|E
2500|$|President Lyndon B. Johnson {{ignored the}} report and {{rejected}} the Kerner Commission's recommendations. In April 1968, {{one month after the}} release of the Kerner report, rioting broke out in more than 100 cities following the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. [...] However, in New York City, Lindsay traveled directly into Harlem, telling black residents that he regretted King's death and was working against poverty. He is credited with averting riots in New York with this direct response, even as other major cities burned. David Garth, who accompanied Lindsay that night, recalled: [...] "There was a wall of people coming across 125th Street, going from west to east... I thought we were dead. John raised his hands, said he was <b>sorry.</b> <b>It</b> was very quiet. My feeling was, his appearance there was very reassuring to people because it wasn't the first time they had seen him. He had gone there on a regular basis. That gave him credibility when it hit the fan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Twitter {{suspended}} Reynolds' account, but restored it {{shortly after}} {{and told him}} to delete the tweet in order to be allowed to use Twitter again. The University of Tennessee released a statement that it was investigating Reynolds as it does not condone language that encourages violence. [...] On September 27, 2016, the law school's Dean Melanie Wilson issued a statement to announce that the University had ended its short-lived investigation with a recommendation that no disciplinary action be taken. [...] Dean Wilson wrote that Reynolds' tweet [...] "...was an exercise of his First Amendment rights. Nevertheless, the tweet offended many members of our community and beyond, and I understand the hurt and frustration they feel." [...] USA Today said that Reynolds had violated the newspaper’s standards and suspended his column for one month. Reynolds issued an apology at the request of USA Today saying:Wednesday night one of my 580,000 tweets blew up. I didn’t live up to my own standards, and I didn’t meet USA TODAY’s standards. For that I apologize, to USA TODAY readers and to my followers on social media. ... Those words can easily be taken to advocate drivers going {{out of their way to}} run down protesters. I meant no such thing, and I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>it</b> seemed I did. What I meant is that drivers who feel their lives are in danger from a violent mob should not stop their vehicles. I remember Reginald Denny, a truck driver who was beaten nearly to death by a mob during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Auster {{refers to}} Llull (as Raymond Lull) {{in his memoir}} The Invention of Solitude in the second part, The Book of Memory. Llull, now going under the name 'Cole Hawlings' and {{revealed}} to be immortal, is a major character in The Box of Delights, the celebrated children's novel by poet John Masefield. [...] He is also {{a major influence on}} the fictional character Zermano in Thomas Salazar's The Day of the Bees, and his name, philosophies, and quotes from his writings appear throughout the novel. In Roberto Bolaño's novel 2666, Amalfitano, a Chilean professor, thinks about [...] "Ramon Llull and his fantastic machine. Fantastic in its uselessness." [...] Adán, Leopoldo Marechal's protagonist of the novel Adán Buenosayres (1948), mentions Ramon Lulio when he walks past a curtiembre (a leather-tanning shop): He says: [...] "Ramon Lulio, que aconsejaba no rehuir del olor de las letrinas a fin de recordar a menudo lo que da el cuerpo de si mismo en su tan frecuentemente olvidada miseria" [...] (Edición Crítica, Colección Archivos, 1997. Page 312) ("Ramon Llull advised not to shy away from the smell of outhouses, in order not to forget that which the body gives out in its often forgotten misery.") In William Gaddis' first novel, The Recognitions, the final paragraph of Chapter II alludes to [...] "Raymond Lully", as a [...] "scholar, a poet, a missionary, a mystic, and one of the foremost figures in the history of alchemy." [...] Llull is also mentioned in passing in Neil Gaiman's comic-book Calliope, an issue of the DC/Vertigo series The Sandman. In The Commodore, the 17th book in Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey–Maturin series, Stephen Maturin remarks that his daughter [...] "...will learn Spanish, too, Castellano. I am <b>sorry</b> <b>it</b> will not be Catalan, a much finer, older, purer, more mellifluous language, with far greater writers — think of En Ramon Llull — but as Captain Aubrey often says, 'You cannot both have a stitch in time and eat it.'" ...|$|E
