5|$|Sarah Barnes is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the British Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks, played by Loui Batley. She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 10 October 2005. Sarah {{was created by}} executive producer David Hanson {{as part of the}} Barnes family. In 2009, Batley quit the serial in order to pursue other projects. Although the character is no longer part of current <b>story</b> <b>lines,</b> she has been central to many key <b>story</b> <b>lines,</b> one of the earliest the high-profile gay storyline involving supercouple John Paul McQueen and Craig Dean.|$|E
5|$|The 2014 novel The Bone Clocks by David Mitchell {{includes}} {{passages that}} {{take place on the}} pier. The 2015 British TV series, Cuffs, which takes place in Brighton features the pier, both in the opening theme as well as in parts of the <b>story</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{a lesser}} known {{character}} in the DC Universe, Anarky has a smaller library of associated comic books and significant <b>story</b> <b>lines</b> than more popular DC Comics characters. Between 1989 and 1996, Anarky was primarily written by Alan Grant in Batman-related comics, received a guest appearance in a single issue of Green Arrow by Kevin Dooley, and was given an entry in Who's Who in the DC Universe.|$|E
50|$|Every fifth week a new {{episode is}} released. As with soap operas, new viewers can easily follow the <b>story</b> <b>line</b> because each episode {{begins with a}} summary of the {{previous}} episode. To date, thirteen seasons and 110 episodes have been produced. The continuous <b>story</b> <b>line</b> is developed by the ensemble and is primarily set in the neighborhood of Wedding. Friedrichshain, Prenzlauer Berg, and even Uckermark are part of the <b>story</b> <b>line.</b> There are stereotypical Berlin characters, e.g., Urberliner (someone originally from Berlin).|$|R

5|$|Hecht saw K-1 as a safer bet, {{given it}} had more {{international}} notoriety. He was also {{not a fan of}} the grappling aspects of MMA, but the UFC rebuffed his suggestion to change the rules of the sport to accommodate striking. Hecht credits Kevin Kay and his editorial collaboration with the UFC for highlighting the show's <b>story</b> <b>lines,</b> which he believes helped drive its ratings success.|$|E
5|$|The three <b>story</b> <b>lines</b> {{are told}} nonlinearly, each {{separated}} by five centuries. The three periods are interwoven with match cuts and recurring visual motifs; Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz play {{the main characters}} in all three narratives. Even within a given narrative, the elements of that particular story are not told in chronological order.|$|E
5|$|We're {{bringing}} Justin {{into the}} world of dance on this one, giving Justin the chance to integrate to different styles of dance. So we kind of kept it simple with the art direction, just real graphic and really highlighting the dance. No big <b>story</b> <b>lines,</b> no crowds of people, just real clean.|$|E

5|$|Bollywood, the Hindi film {{industry}} based in Mumbai, produces around 150â€“200 films every year. The name Bollywood is {{a blend of}} Bombay and Hollywood. The 2000s saw a growth in Bollywood's popularity overseas. This led filmmaking to new heights in terms of quality, cinematography and innovative <b>story</b> <b>lines</b> as well as technical advances such as special effects and animation. Studios in Goregaon, including Film City, are the location for most movie sets. The city also hosts the Marathi {{film industry}} which has seen increased popularity in recent years, and TV production companies.|$|E
5|$|McCracken, {{who came}} to Hollywood after winning acclaim in the 1943 {{production}} of Oklahoma!, was deeply discouraged by her experiences filming the Hollywood Canteen number and did not like working with Prinz. As a choreographer he {{made no effort to}} integrate his dances into specific <b>story</b> <b>lines,</b> or to choreograph specific dance steps. This resulted deep disillusionment for McCracken, whose Oklahoma! dances were choreographed by Agnes de Mille, since Prinz was not able to support or advance McCracken's artistic development. However, he gave her latitude to incorporate ballet in her dance routine, and Prinz did not object to her ideas.|$|E
5|$|Most pre-game {{media and}} popular {{coverage}} of the 2008 Orange Bowl focused on the matchup between Kansas's No.2 scoring offense and Virginia Tech's No.2 scoring defense. Outside factors, such as coaching, previous experience, and fan support were also considered in pre-game analysis of the matchup. Outside <b>story</b> <b>lines</b> included Virginia Tech's recovery from the Virginia Tech Massacre, recovery from late-season losses suffered by each team (against Missouri for Kansas and against Boston College for Virginia Tech).|$|E

5|$|The Secret Lives of Waldo Kitty was {{produced}} by Lou Scheimer and Norm Prescott and directed by Don Christensen and Rudy Larriva. Critically, positive response was aimed at the show's imaginative <b>story</b> <b>lines</b> {{and its ability to}} parody pop culture events well. However, producer Scheimer was extremely upset by the series' final result, listing the issues that arose during production and the amount of episodes produced as reasons why among others. The series has a total of just 13 episodes. In 1989, three episodes from The Secret Lives of Waldo Kitty were featured on a VHS tape released by United American Video.|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} {{features the}} closure of several long-running arcs, {{as well as new}} introductions to the series' mythology. Series creator Chris Carter felt that the series' ongoing <b>story</b> <b>lines</b> were becoming too confusing, so he scrapped them and started over. Released on September 27, 2005, the collection generally received mixed to positive reviews from critics. William B. Davis, Mitch Pileggi, Nicholas Lea and Laurie Holden all play supporting roles in the collection.|$|E
5|$|Film noirs {{tend to have}} unusually {{convoluted}} <b>story</b> <b>lines,</b> frequently involving flashbacks {{and other}} editing techniques that disrupt and sometimes obscure the narrative sequence. Framing the entire primary narrative as a flashback is also a standard device. Voiceover narration, sometimes used as a structuring device, {{came to be seen}} as a noir hallmark; while classic noir is generally associated with first-person narration (i.e., by the protagonist), Stephen Neale notes that third-person narration is common among noirs of the semidocumentary style. Neo-noirs as varied as The Element of Crime (surrealist), After Dark, My Sweet (retro), and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (meta) have employed the flashback/voiceover combination.|$|E

5|$|From 1999 to 2001, {{the book}} was also adapted as an {{animated}} television series, broadcast on CITV in the UK and on YTV in Canada. It was produced by Martin Rosen and starred several well-known British actors, including Stephen Fry, Rik Mayall, Dawn French, John Hurt, and Richard Briers, running {{for a total of}} 39 episodes over three seasons. Although the story was broadly based on that of the novel and most characters and events retained, some of the <b>story</b> <b>lines</b> and characters (especially in later episodes) were entirely new. In 2003, the second season was nominated for a Gemini Award for Best Original Music Score for a Dramatic Series.|$|E
5|$|Gregory House, M.D., often {{construed}} as a misanthropic medical genius, heads a team of diagnosticians at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Most episodes revolve around the diagnosis of a primary patient and start with a cold open set outside the hospital, showing events ending {{with the onset of}} the patient's symptoms. The typical episode follows the team in their attempts to diagnose and treat the patient's illness, which often fail until the patient's condition is critical. They usually treat only patients whom other doctors have not accurately diagnosed, and House routinely rejects cases that he does not find interesting. The <b>story</b> <b>lines</b> tend to focus on his unconventional medical theories and practices, and on the other characters' reactions to them, rather than on the details of the treatments.|$|E
5|$|The season {{continued}} {{to focus on}} the surgical residency of five young interns as they try to balance the challenges of their competitive careers with the difficulties that determine their personal lives. It was set in the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, located in the city of Seattle, Washington. Whereas the first season put the emphasis mainly on the unexpected impact the surgical field has on the main characters, the second season provides a detailed perspective on the personal background of each character, focusing on the consequences that their decisions have on their careers. Throughout the season, new <b>story</b> <b>lines</b> were introduced, including the love triangle between Meredith Grey, Derek Shepherd, and Addison Montgomery, the main arc of the season. Also heavily developed was the story line involving Izzie Stevens' relationship with patient Denny Duquette, which resulted in critical acclaim and positive fan response.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{producers}} knew that Macfayden {{would leave the}} series, {{they did not know}} when he would do so, and so the first two episodes were initially written without him. In either case, {{the producers}} created a new character, Adam Carter. In addition, the writers heavily researched the episodes; many of the <b>story</b> <b>lines</b> are based on truth. The producers also took information from advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The series was directed in five blocks of two episodes in each. Filming started in January 2004 and took place over six to seven months. Shooting took place almost entirely in London, England, with some scenes shot in a cross-English Channel ferry in the fifth episode.|$|E
5|$|Three or {{four months}} before the release of Little Busters!, {{it was decided that}} an adult version of the game would be {{developed}} titled , or Little Busters-EX for short. Na-Ga designed the heroine Saya Tokido and Maeda wrote her scenario. Tonokawa wrote Sasami Sasasegawa's scenario, and Shirokiri wrote Kanata Futaki's <b>story.</b> <b>Lines</b> from the original game were rewritten as well for Ecstasy, and the total number of lines with spoken dialogue comes to 43,347 lines. The total word count in Ecstasy exceeds that of Clannad by about 4,000 words, making it Key's longest work, and carries so much data that Ecstasy was released on two DVDs instead of one for the original release.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the short}} stories were adapted for {{publication}} in comic strip format, which were published daily in the Daily Express newspaper and syndicated worldwide. The Living Daylights ran from 12 September to 12 November 1966, adapted by Jim Lawrence and illustrated by Yaroslav Horak; the same pair also worked on Octopussy, which ran from 14 November 1966 to 27 May 1967. The <b>story</b> <b>lines</b> for the strips were altered from the original Fleming version {{to ensure that they}} contained a glamorous reason for being Bond involved and to include Bond in action. The strips were reprinted by Titan Books in 1988 and then again in The James Bond Omnibus Vol. 2, published in 2011.|$|E
