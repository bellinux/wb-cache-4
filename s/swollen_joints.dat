5|$|Known as baka or baka ni viti in Fiji, Ficus obliqua {{has many}} of its parts used in Fijian {{traditional}} medicine, and was previously held to be sacred there. Its white sap {{has been used for}} painful or <b>swollen</b> <b>joints</b> and limbs or boils, or diluted with water and drunk to improve breast milk. Liquid extracted from the root bark has been used for headaches or, when diluted, to improve health after childbirth, and the leaves are applied to venereal lesions. The species has been traditionally used for boils in Samoa and Tonga.|$|E
5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. <b>Swollen</b> <b>joints</b> limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.|$|E
25|$|Serious {{complications}} {{may occur}} {{in patients who}} have weakened immune systems, including severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and bronchopleural fistulas requiring resection, lung nodules, and possible disseminated form, where the infection spreads throughout the body. The disseminated form of coccidioidomycosis can devastate the body, causing skin ulcers, abscesses, bone lesions, <b>swollen</b> <b>joints</b> with severe pain, heart inflammation, urinary tract problems, and inflammation of the brain's lining, {{which can lead to}} death.|$|E
40|$|Three {{articular}} indices {{for measuring}} disease activity are compared. In a cross sectional study the Thompson articular index (a modified Lansbury index) correlated better with laboratory variables than the Ritchie articular index or a <b>swollen</b> <b>joint</b> score (Thompson 0. 74 - 0. 77; Ritchie 0. 57 - 0. 58; <b>swollen</b> <b>joint</b> count 0. 51 - 0. 59).

25|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE), also {{known simply as}} lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue {{in many parts of}} the body. Symptoms vary between people and may be mild to severe. Common symptoms include painful and <b>swollen</b> <b>joints,</b> fever, chest pain, hair loss, mouth ulcers, swollen lymph nodes, feeling tired, and a red rash which is most commonly on the face. Often there are periods of illness, called flares, and periods of remission during which there are few symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Fatty acids: Gamma-linolenic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, {{may reduce}} pain, tender joint count and stiffness, and is {{generally}} safe. For omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (found in fish oil), a meta-analysis reported a favorable effect on pain, although {{confidence in the}} effect was considered moderate. The same review reported less inflammation but no difference in joint function. A review examined the effect of marine oil omega-3 fatty acids on pro-inflammatory eicosanoid concentrations; leukotriene4 (LTB4) was lowered in people with rheumatoid arthritis but not in those with non-autoimmune chronic diseases. (LTB4) increases vascular permeabiltity and stimulates other inflammatory substances. A third meta-analysis looked at fish consumption. The result was a weak, non-statistically significant inverse association between fish consumption and RA. A fourth review limited inclusion to trials in which people eat ≥2.7 g/day {{for more than three}} months. Use of pain relief medication was decreased, but improvements in tender or <b>swollen</b> <b>joints,</b> morning stiffness and physical function were not changed. Collectively, the current evidence is not strong enough to determine that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids or regular consumption of fish are effective treatments for rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{mentioned}} Bertin's hands. Twentieth-century {{art historian}} Albert Boime described them as [...] "powerful, vulturine... grasping his thighs in a gesture... projecting... enormous strength controlled". Some contemporary critics {{were not so}} kind. The photographer and critic Félix Tournachon was harshly critical, and disparaged {{what he saw as}} a [...] "fantastical bundle of flesh... under which, instead of bones and muscles, there can only be intestines – this flatulent hand, the rumbling of which I can hear!" [...] Bertin's hands made a different impression on the critic F. de Lagenevais, who remarked: [...] "A mediocre artist would have modified them, he would have replaced those <b>swollen</b> <b>joints</b> with the cylindrical fingers of the first handy model; but by this single alteration he would have changed the expression of the whole personality... the energetic and mighty nature".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the midst}} of this {{creative}} activity, his health deteriorated. The cause of his death was officially diagnosed as typhoid fever, though other theories have been proposed, including the tertiary stage of syphilis. By the late 1820s, Schubert's health was failing and he confided to some friends that he feared that he was near death. In the late summer of 1828, the composer saw court physician Ernst Rinna, who may have confirmed Schubert's suspicions that he was ill beyond cure and likely to die soon. Some of his symptoms matched those of mercury poisoning (mercury was then a common treatment for syphilis, again suggesting that Schubert suffered from it). At the beginning of November, he again fell ill, experiencing headaches, fever, <b>swollen</b> <b>joints,</b> and vomiting. He was generally unable to retain solid food and his condition worsened. Schubert died in Vienna, aged 31, on 19 November 1828, at the apartment of his brother Ferdinand. The last musical work he had wished to hear was Beethoven's String Quartet No. 14 in C-sharp minor, Op. 131; his friend, violinist Karl Holz, who was present at the gathering, five days before Schubert's death, commented: [...] "The King of Harmony has sent the King of Song a friendly bidding to the crossing". It was next to Beethoven, whom he had admired all his life, that Schubert was buried by his own request, in the village cemetery of Währing, Vienna.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} bee venom acupuncture(BVA) on the rehabilitation {{and quality of life}} in rheumatoid arthritis(RA) patients Methods: Patients with RA were treated with the BVA therapy twice a week for 3 months. Tender <b>joint</b> counts, <b>swollen</b> <b>joint</b> counts, morning stiffness, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate(ESR), C-reactive protein(CRP), patient global assessment, physician global assessment, Korean health assessment questionnaire(KHAQ) were estimated and analyzed before and after BVA therapy. Results: Tender <b>joint</b> counts, <b>swollen</b> <b>joint</b> counts, morning stiffness showed significant decrease after BVA therapy. But, as acute inflammatory reactants, ESR showed no significant difference and CRP showed significant increase after BVA therapy. Patient global assessment, physician global assessment, and KHAQ index showed significant improvement after BVA therapy. Conclusions: BVA therapy can improve rehabilitation and health-related quality of life in RA patients as well as clinical symptoms and signs.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} effects of a 3 -month land- and waterbased {{exercise}} programme among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) sufferers. METHODS: Patients with RA Functional Class I and II (N= 10) were randomly assigned to a land-based exercise group (Group L) (N= 4), water-based exercise group (Group W) (N= 4) or a control group (Group C) (N= 2). Testing parameters included <b>swollen</b> <b>joint</b> count (SJC), tender joint count (TJC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), haemoglobin (Hb), 50 -ft (15. 2 -m) walk test, grip strength, isokinetic strength of knee extensors and flexors, knee range of motion (ROM) and aerobic capacity. RESULTS: There were individual improvements in most of the physical status parameters tested for the experimental groups (land-based exercise group and water-based exercise group) while the general trend for the control group was that of deterioration. Appropriate land-based exercises did not appear to aggravate disease activity. However, the water-based exercise programme was superior in controlling the disease activity with regards to the tender and <b>swollen</b> <b>joint</b> counts. CONCLUSION: Both exercise interventions appeared to be beneficial in the treatment of RA. Further research is required comparing various modes of exercises for the treatment of RA, using larger samples and evaluating the long-term effects. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is an {{important}} inflammatory mediator in nonhuman animal models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine whether blood mononuclear cells from patients with active RA (as compared to control subjects) have higher levels of NO synthase type 2 (NOS 2) and produce more NO in vitro. Leukocytes from 25 RA patients and 20 normal subjects were examined. Arthritis activity was assessed by tender and <b>swollen</b> <b>joint</b> counts, duration of morning stiffness, patient assessment of pain, physician and patient global assessment of disease activity, the modified Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire, and by blood levels of acute phase reactants. Blood mononuclear cell NOS enzyme activity/antigen content and nitrite/nitrate formation in vitro were measured. Blood mononuclear cells from RA patients had increased NOS activity and increased NOS 2 antigen content as compared to those from normal subjects, and responded to interferon-'y with increased NOS expression and nitrite/nitrate production in vitro. NOS activity of freshly isolated blood mononuclear cells correlated significantly with disease activity, as assessed by tender and <b>swollen</b> <b>joint</b> counts. Our results demonstrate that patients with RA have systemic activation for NOS 2 expression, and that the degree of activation correlates with disease activity. Increase...|$|R
40|$|Background Foot pain in {{patients}} diagnosed with early rheumatoid arthritis is common. Objectives To investigate effects of off-the-shelf foot orthoses on outcomes of <b>swollen</b> and tender <b>joints,</b> and pain, {{in patients}} with early rheumatoid arthritis. Methods Thirty-five patients with painful and <b>swollen</b> foot <b>joints</b> were recruited. None had previously used foot orthoses or had contraindications to their use. Any patients with concomitant musculoskeletal disease, endocrine disorders, and neurological disease, were excluded. At baseline, participants were prescribed a customised off-the-shelf foot orthosis with chair-side modifications. Data was collected at baseline, three and six months. Foot pain (using Visual Analogue Scale) {{and the number of}} tender and <b>swollen</b> foot <b>joints</b> was measured. Results There was a trend towards a {{reduction in the number of}} <b>swollen</b> and tender <b>joints</b> by 3 months with a further improvement by 6 months. Statistically (p< 0. 05) and clinically significant reductions in pain levels was also noted. Conclusion Patients diagnosed with early RA may benefit from using off-the-shelf foot orthoses with the majority of their pain reduction occurring within the first 3 months of use, but with some small further symptomatic improvement up to 6 months. Their was a tendency to a reduction in <b>swollen</b> and tender <b>joints</b> although more studies are required to substantiate these findings...|$|R
