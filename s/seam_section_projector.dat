30|$|To ensure {{seamless}} transition between DEMs, Robinson et al. [11] proposed blending DEMs using weighted averaging method where weight {{is a function}} of distance to transition line between two DEMs. The blending zone in their case followed a single parallel and had constant width. However, many new DEMs derived from Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) cover irregularly shaped areas and can contain gaps due to complex terrain and vegetation. Moreover, sub-meter resolution DEMs capture microtopography and above ground features not present in lower-resolution DEMs leading to larger elevation differences along the DEMs seam, which require wider blending zone in order to achieve smooth transition. On the other hand, a narrow blending zone is preferable along the <b>seam</b> <b>sections</b> with small elevation differences to preserve the high resolution topographic features captured by the DEMs.|$|R
40|$|Silicic, mafic and alkali intra-seam tonsteins {{have been}} known from SW China {{for a number of}} years. This paper reports on the geochemical {{compositions}} of coals and tonsteins from three <b>seam</b> <b>sections</b> of the Songzao Coalfield, SW China, and evaluates the geological factors responsible for the chemical characteristics of the coal seams, with emphasis on the influence from different types of volcanic ashes. The roof and floor samples of the Songzao coal seams mostly have high TiO 2 contents, consistent with a high TiO 2 content in the detrital sediment input from the source region, namely mafic basalts from the Kangdian Upland on the western margin of the coal basin. The coals from the Songzao Coalfield generally have high ash yields and are highly enriched in trace elements including Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, rare earth elements (REE), Y, Hg and Se; some variation occurs among different <b>seam</b> <b>sections</b> due to input of geochemically different volcanic ash materials. The geochemistry of the Songzao coals has also been affected by the adjacent tonstein/K-bentonite bands. The relatively immobile elements that are enriched in the altered volcanic ashes also tend to be enriched in the adjacent coal plies, possibly due to leaching by groundwaters. The coals near the alkali tonstein bands in the Tonghua and Yuyang sections of the Songzao Coalfield are mostly high in Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, Th, U, REE and Y. Coal samples overlying the mafic K-bentonite in the Tonghua section are high in V, Cr, Zn and Cu. The Datong coal, which has neither visible tonstein layers nor obvious volcanogenic minerals, has high TiO 2, V, Cr, Ni, Cu and Zn concentrations in the intervals between the coal plies affected by mafic and alkaline volcanic ashes. This is consistent with the suggestion that a common source material was supplied to the coal basin, derived from the erosion of mafic basaltic rocks of the Kangdian Upland. Although the Songzao coal is generally a high-sulfur coal, most of the chalcophile trace elements show either poor or negative correlations with total iron sulfide contents. The absence of traditional pyrite-metal associations may reflect wide variations in the concentrations of these elements in individual pyrite/marcasite components, or simply poor retention of these elements in the pyrite/marcasite of the relevant coals...|$|R

The primary objective of this work is to analyze the quality of Indian Coals and obtain their mineral species-specific information at different depths. The samples were obtained from Talcher Coalfield, Odisha, India. Coal from four <b>seam</b> <b>sections</b> in the Talcher coalfield, India are mainly high ash coal (> 50  %) and volatile matter deceases along with the seam depth. XRD {{results show that the}} major mineral phases present in the coal are quartz and kaolinite. Siderite, illite, and anatase were found in minor quantities. It has been observed that the clay minerals (kaolinite, silimanite, illite) decompose at higher temperature and traces of dolomite, mullite, hematite etc. are formed during the process of combustion. Among the four seams (M 2, M 12, M 24 and M 43) studied, ash of M 43 has high Al 2 O 3 %, TiO 2 % and K 2 O% content and low SiO 2 %, CaO% and MgO% content. High acid-to-base ratios contributed to high ash fusion temperatures (IDT >  1500  °C) and low slagging potential of the coals studied. Relatively low fouling index (< 0.3) was estimated for all the coal seams studied. Furthermore, thermodynamic modeling software, FactSage, have been used to envision the mineral phase transformations that take place between 800 and 1500  °C during coal combustion.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. This study {{concerns}} {{the use of}} magneto-fluid dynamic mechanisms in laser beam welding that work {{by being able to}} change flow conditions in the weld pool so as to stabilize them and achieve greater welding speed and process quality. With quantitative esti-mates of magneto-fluid dynamic effects on weld pool flow along with experi-mental studies, it is demonstrated in what way such mechanisms can be effectively deployed in laser beam welding. “Mag-netically supported laser beam welding” (MSLBW), developed in this context, suppresses humping, improves top bead quality, modifies the <b>seam</b> cross <b>section</b> within broad limits, reduces splashing activity, dampens plasma plume fluctua-tions and, ultimately, increases process stability. Note the process action observed is dependent upon the polarity of the mag-netic field connected. One hypothesis considered in this context about a net current flowing through the melt can be confirmed. Accordingly, during initial laser beam welding (without a magnetic field), an electric current is generated in the melt. The reason for this electric cur-rent is the thermoelectric voltage be-tween solidified seam material and melt, as well as between the base material and the melt...|$|R

40|$|Cleats {{are natural}} {{fractures}} in coal {{that serve as}} permeability avenues for darcy flow of gas and water to the well bore during production. Theoretically, the development of cleat and coal-seam permeability {{is related to the}} rank, type and grade of the coal concerned. The permeability of a coal seam, moreover, may change during gas production, due to either matrix shrinkage, cleat closure or both. Matrix shrinkage and cleat closure are also affected by numerous geological factors, including coal rank, desorption character and geological setting. A method integrating geochemical and petrographic analysis, reservoir engineering diagnosis, geophysical data and production characteristics has been developed, and used to determine the initial permeability of coal seam on a metre by metre scale. This overcomes the constraint of conventional well test by refining the test intervals. The effect of coal rank, grade and type on the initial permeability of coal seams was also investigated, with the special reference to the coals of the Galilee Basin. The permeability was estimated using analytical equations based on the permeability data obtained from well tests and from cleat descriptions within the <b>seam</b> <b>section.</b> This aspect of the study showed that the coal type, rank and grade strongly influence the initial permeability of individual coal seams. Increase in ash content has negative effect on cleat development and permeability. On contrast, increasing coal rank and proportion of bright coal lead to reduction in cleat spacing and increase in permeability. Twenty three core samples collected from the Qinshui Basin in China were evaluated in the laboratory to investigate the effects of coal grade, rank and type on the change in permeability during pressure depletion. The experimental factors included the coal's geochemical properties, the permeability against changing pressure, and strain with pore pressure depletion. This part of the study fund that permeability changes with pore pressure depletion in relation to coal rank, grade and type. The strain values determined by the experiments with pressure depletion were used to identify the mechanical principles associated with changes in permeability during pressure depletion in relation to the rank, grade and type of the coal concerned. A reservoir simulation study was used to investigate the effects of desorption pressure, geological setting and coal rank on the variation in permeability under in-situ conditions during coalbed methane production, based on a study in the Hedong area, Ordos Basin, China. The simulations allowed history matching of gas and water production from 12 wells with the actual well conditions specified as the model pressure. Good agreement was achieved between the model yields and the actual production data, suggesting that the changing permeability interpreted from the simulation is a realistic representation of the in-situ reservoir properties. The reservoir simulation study found that the decreases in permeability with production exceeded the increase in permeability caused by matrix shrinkage for nearly all wells in the Hedong area. The magnitude of the decrease in permeability increases as the gap between initial pressure and desorption pressure increases. The decrease in permeability is slower in the zone closest to the fault. The reservoir simulation has demonstrated that coal rank influences significantly the change in permeability during coalbed methane production...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research program has been to improve the rate-of-penetration in deep hostile environments by improving the life cycle and performance of coiled-tubing, {{an important component of}} a deep well drilling system for oil and gas exploration. The current process of the manufacture long tubular steel products consists of shaping the tube from flat strip, welding the <b>seam</b> and <b>sections</b> into lengths that can be miles long, and coiling onto reels. However, the welds, that are a weak point, now limit the performance of the coil tubing. This is not only from a toughness standpoint but also from a corrosion standpoint. By utilizing the latest developments in the sintering of materials with microwave energy and powder metal extrusion technology for the manufacture of seamless coiled tubing and other tubular products, these problems can be eliminated. The project is therefore to develop a continuous microwave process to sinter continuously steel tubulars and butt-join them using microwave/induction process. The program started about three years ago and now we {{are in the middle of}} Phase II. In Phase I (which ended in February 2005) a feasibility study of the extrusion process of steel powder and continuously sinter the extruded tubing was conducted. The research program has been based on the development of microwave technology to process tubular specimens of powder metals, especially steels. The existing microwave systems at the Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) and Dennis Tool Company (DTC) were suitably modified to process tubular small specimens. The precursor powder metals were either extruded or cold isostatically pressed (CIP) to form tubular specimens. After conducting an extensive and systematic investigation of extrusion process for producing long tubes, it was determined that there were several difficulties in adopting extrusion process and it cannot be economically used for producing thousands of feet long green tubing. Therefore, in the Phase II the approach was modified to the microwave sintering combined with Cold Isostatic Press (CIP) and joining (by induction or microwave). This process can be developed into a semi-continuous sintering process if the CIP can produce parts fast enough to match the microwave sintering rates. This report summarizes the progress made to-date in this new approach. The final steel composition matching with the Quality tubing's QT- 16 Cr 80 was short listed and used for all experiments. Bonding experiments using 4 different braze powders were conducted and the process optimized to obtain high degree of bonding strength. For fabrication of green tubulars a large CIP unit was acquired and tested. This equipment is located at the Dennis Tool facility in Houston. Microwave sintering experiments for continuous processing of the CIPed tubes are under progress in order to identify the optimum conditions.

40|$|The {{importance}} of organic sulphur fixation in {{the preservation of}} organic matter in humic coal-forming environments is demonstrated in this thesis. The transgression of coal depositional systems by marine waters during their deposition and early diagenesis enables the production of reduced inorganic sulphur species by sulphate-reducing bacteria. The presence of these reactive sulphur species, {{in combination with the}} altered chemical and microbial regime, influences the preservation and petroleum potential of humic coal. Three lignite samples taken over a two meter depth profile of a core in the Eocene, Heartbreak Ridge lignite deposit, SE Western Australia, were analysed by a suite of geochemical techniques to identify origins and transformation pathways of their organic matter. Rock-Eval, FTIR microscopy, and pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GCMS) indicate that the composition of the lignite and its extract are typical of immature type III organic matter with a predominance of aromatic and oxygen containing functionalities. Variation in the macromolecular composition of the three lignites are consistent with more pronounced degradation of the organic matter in the lowermost lignite horizon. Nickel boride desulphurisation of polar and asphaltene fractions of the lignites showed the presence of sulphur-bound higher plant triterpenoids, in particular olean- 12 -ene, n-alkanes of even predominance, C 29 steranes and extended 17 â(H), 21 â(H) -hopanes. Deuterium labelling experiments indicated that these components were mostly bound to a single sulphur, at sites about the original functionality in the natural product precursors. The presence of singularly sulphur-bound aromatic ring A degraded and pentacyclic triterpenoids represent the spectrum of aromatic triterpenoid intermediates undergoing diagenesis before sulphur incorporation. Stable carbon isotopic ++analyses of the free and sulphur-bound aliphatic hydrocarbons confirmed carbon sources from both higher plants and bacteria. Oxygenated lipids consisted of even carbon-numbered n-alkanoic monocarboxylic acids, ù-hydroxy fatty acids and n-alkanols, n-alkan- 2 -ones, 6, 10, 14 -triinethylpentadecan- 2 -one, and oxygenated hopanoids and higher plant triterpenoids. BY the onset of sulphurisation in the Heartbreak Ridge lignite, extended hopanoid degradation had come to a hiatus, in marked contrast to the variable alteration of the higher plant triterpenoids. The oxygen-containing lipids of the extracts are implicated as the primary source of the sulphurised hydrocarbons, although not necessarily via direct sulphurisation of their present sent form, but through the formation of more reactive intermediates. These results implicate sulphur fixation as a means by which lipids of similar structures to the natural product precursors are preserved in coal forming environments. That diagenetic alteration of the oxygenated lipids mirrors that of the sulphur-bound hydrocarbons confirms that the onset of marine incursion and the formation of reduced inorganic sulphides does inhibit (and also preserve) the normal biogeochemical transformations of organic matter in coal-forming environments. The technique of reaction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (R-GCMS) was also applied to the analysis of the polar extracts from a Heartbreak Ridge lignite, together with the polar extracts from the Monterey Formation shale (Naples Beach, USA; Miocene age). Palladium black acting as a catalyst under hydrogen carrier gas in the vaporising injection port of a GCMS, effected gas phase reaction of the volatile constituents in the polar mixtures. The fully active catalyst effected hydrogenation, desulphurisation and decarbonylation/decarboxylation reactions. Polar fractions of the Heartbreak Ridge lignite ++reacted to produce angiosperm-derived triterpenoids and bacterially-derived hopanoids. The reaction of the Monterey Formation shale polars resulted in the formation of high relative amounts of pristane and phytane with a predominance of the latter, as well. as a suite of steroidal and triterpenoid moieties, typical of marine organic matter. However, R-GCMS provided less detailed information on the exact nature of the functionalised lipids partitioned within the polar fraction than that obtained by more conventional wet chemical analyses. The compositions of 35 marine-influenced, bituminous coals, from the Eocene Brunner Coal Measures of New Zealand were studied to assess the effect of the timing of marine incursion on the molecular characteristics of coals. Based upon their stratigraphic position and their volatile matter and total sulphur contents, coal samples were classified into those where the mire was flooded during or at the end of deposition (Class A/B) and those that experienced postdepositional access of marine water during later diagenetic stages (Class C/D). Rock-Eval pyrolyses showed that sulphur-rich Brunner coals generally display moderate increases in pyrolytic yields with respect to the low-sulphur Brunner coals. Class A-C coals generally release larger quantities of hydrocarbons during Rock-Eval pyrolysis than the Class D coals, suggesting that sulphur fixation can enhance the hydrocarbon potential of buried mires, provided sulphur is introduced early. Variation in Carbon Preference Indices, isoprenoid/alkane ratios, the Methylphenanthrene Index and phenanthrene/anthracene of bitumens and pyrolysates both within different seam profiles and between different sampling localities can be attributed to changes in microbial regime as well as subtle variations in rank. Pristane/phytane, dibenzothiophene/phenanthrene and thiophene ratios are closely related ++to organic sulphur contents, but are also influenced by these changes in rank and differences in the timing of marine incursion. Organic sulphur contents and biomarker compositions are related through a drillcore profile, which confirms the role of diagenetic sulphur sequestration in preserving specific biomarkers (steranes, higher plant triterpanes, extended hopanes) in coal-forming environments. Biomarker ratios that vary accordingly include the homohopane index, Ts/Tm, C 29 Ts/norhopane, C 30 diahopane/hopane, sterane/hopane ratio, C 29 diasterane/sterane, oleanane/hopane, oleanoid triterpane/hopane, and ring A degraded triterpanes/des-E-hopane. Diasterane concentrations were greatest in high sulphur coals. It is suggested that sterenes, generated from sulphur-bound steroids of regular stereochemistry in the subsurface, undergo acid-catalysed rearrangement and hydrogenation to enhance diasterane concentrations. A similar formation mechanism can be invoked for the rearranged hopanes (Ts, C 29 Ts, C 30 diahopane) and oleanoid triterpanes. The timing of sulphur fixation {{does not appear to have}} influenced the formation of biomarkers except in one case. The only lipid class that degraded rapidly enough for the precursors required for sulphurisation to be removed prior to saline access is the higher plant triterpenoids. Stable carbon isotopic analysis of the n-alkanes, isoprenoids and hopanoids from the Pike River Outcrop <b>seam</b> <b>section</b> confirms both higher plant and microbial sources. In particular, the carbon isotopic composition of phytane suggests that methanogenic decomposition of the Pike River peat occurred. The isotopic signatures are invariant to changes in the degree or timing (Class A-C only) of sulphur access to this outcrop. This body of work finds that the introduction of marine waters (and the formation of reduced sulphides) in the early stages of mire and peat ++development preserves the inherited lipid composition of the peat and does not overwhelm this biotic signature during sulphate reduction. As such, the selective preservation of certain biomarkers enables their use as indicators of marine-influence in source rocks. The application of several biomarker ratios to the characterisation of crude oils from the Taranaki Basin of New Zealand provides further evidence for the generation of liquid hydrocarbons from marine-influenced, angiosperm-rich coals...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} of the abundance and modes of occurrence of the mineral matter and trace elements in the Permian coal seams of the Sydney Basin, eastern Australia and the Songzao Coalfield, SW China, as well as the relationships between trace elements and mineral matter components within the different parts of the coal seams. A range of analytical techniques have been used to obtain relevant data, including optical microscopy, electron microscopy/microprobe analyses, quantitative X-ray diffraction, geochemical techniques (ICP-MS/OES, CV-AFS, HG-AFS and Eschka method), and Laser Raman spectroscopy analysis. The Greta coal is a high-volatile bituminous coal and typically contains a high proportion of liptinite. The upper section of the Greta seam has several different indicators of marine influence, such as anomalously low vitrinite reflectance and abundant syngenetic pyrite, in the top part of the seam. Pyrite typically comprises 40 to 56 % of the mineral assemblage in the coals from the marine-influenced upper section. In contrast, the mineral matter in the lower section contains minor pyrite, and relatively abundant dawsonite, which may have been formed by reactions between earlier-precipitated kaolinite and Na 2 CO 3 - or NaHCO 3 -bearing fluids. The minerals, including most of the clay minerals, pyrite, siderite and quartz, within most of the Greta coal plies are largely of authigenic origin. Authigenic Na-rich I/S may have been syngenetically precipitated, probably after the peat was accumulated, with abundant Na and relatively minor K ions being supplied by the marine water. Coals from the Great Northern and Bulli seams are mainly high volatile A bituminous and medium volatile bituminous in rank, respectively. The mineral fractions of the coals, especially in the middle parts of the seams, are dominated by authigenic kaolinite with a very low abundance of quartz and carbonate minerals. Apart from tonstein bands in the Great Northern seam, authigenic processes therefore appear to be the dominant mechanism of mineral matter formation in both coal seams. Authigenic K-feldspar also occurs in {{the lower part of the}} Great Northern seam, with a variety of unusual modes of occurrence. A late syngenetic low-temperature hydrothermal fluid injection process is suggested for formation of this feldspar component. Both quartz and non-kaolinite clay minerals are also abundant in the lowermost ply of the coal seams, suggesting that the immediate base of the peat bed in each case was made-up of organic matter admixed with the same detrital sediment as supplied to the basin. K-feldspar, which is present in the coals and non-coal bands in the lower metre of the Great Northern <b>seam</b> <b>section,</b> is not present in the Bulli seam. This may reflect deposition of the Bulli seam at a greater distance from the sediment source, which was located in the New England Fold Belt. The coals from the Songzao Coalfield are mainly high ash, high sulphur semianthracites. XRD analysis indicates that minerals within the Songzao coals are mainly kaolinite, pyrite (or marcasite in some cases), and quartz, with minor proportions of carbonates, feldspar, anatase and sulphate minerals. Some of the illite and I/S is Na-rich in some of Datong coal samples. The I/S in the Songzao coals is mainly an alteration product of the original dispersed volcanic ash, due to the availability of necessary ions (e. g. K, Na, Mg) in the marine-influenced coal swamp. Organically-bound Na, which was expelled from the organic matter with coal rank advance, especially with anthracitization, may have supplied additional Na for the formation of Na-rich illite and I/S. Authigenic I/S also commonly occurs in a Tonghua coal ply that is overlain by a mafic bentonite and underlain by an alkali tonstein. K, Na and Mg for the formation of the I/S were probably derived from the leaching of the adjacent alkali tonstein and mafic bentonite. Although the marine water was also a possible supplier of the alkali elements, authigenic I/S is rare in other coals that occur further away from the altered volcanic layers. REE minerals, which occur as fracture infillings in a Tonghua coal sample, were probably crystallized from ascending hydrothermal fluids carrying high REE concentrations, which may in turn have been associated with contemporaneous volcanic activity. Two groups of REE minerals, probably REE-hydroxides or oxyhydroxides, and REE-carbonates, were tentatively identified. Tonstein bands in the Great Northern seam consist essentially of kaolinite. The occurrence of idiomorphic crystals of K-feldspar, which may represent members of the anorthoclase-sanidine series or a sodic sanidine, indicates an acid to intermediate volcanic ash input. Two tonstein and one K-bentonite bands in the Songzao coal seams have kaolinite and I/S as the dominant clay minerals, respectively. The volcanic ash layers in the peat swamp may have been originally converted to smectite, which was in turn altered to I/S and illite during diagenesis and/or rank advance, assuming that necessary ions (e. g. K, Na and Mg) were available from the marine water percolating in the peat swamp. Na-rich I/S may also have been formed in the claystones, with the additional Na probably being released from the organic matter during the coals rank advance. The thin tonstein layers were formed, with relevant ions having been largely removed, probably due to a greater leaching efficiency. In the relatively low-ash coals of the Greta, Great Northern, and Bulli seams, the concentrations of most trace elements are lower than that of average worldwide coals. By contrast, the high-ash Songzao coals have relatively high concentrations of most trace elements compared to averages for worldwide coals. In the sulphur-rich Songzao and Greta coals, most of the chalcophile trace elements show either poor or negative correlations with total iron sulphide contents. Only Hg and Se in the Songzao coals and Hg, Tl and As in the Greta coals are positively correlated with iron sulphides, respectively. This may be because the pyrite in the Songzao and Greta coals is mostly of syngenetic origin. Some chalcophile elements are correlated with Al 2 O 3, which most likely indicates a common source. The absence of traditional pyrite-metal associations may reflect wide variations in the concentrations of these elements in individual pyrite/marcasites, or simply poor retention of those elements in the pyrite/marcasite of the relevant coals. In addition to the lithophile elements, chalchophile elements in the Great Northern coals, including Se, Pb and Cu, also appear to be associated with kaolinite, and more likely a common source as well. The geochemistry of the coals has been affected by the adjacent tonstein/bentonite bands. The relatively immobile elements enriched in the altered volcanic ashes also tend to be enriched in the adjacent coal plies, possibly due to leaching by groundwaters. The coals near the alkali tonstein bands in the Tonghua and Yuyang sections of the Songzao Coalfield are high in Nb, Ta, Hf, Ga, Th, U, and REE. Coal samples overlying the mafic bentonite in the Tonghua section are high in TiO 2, V, Cr, Zn and Cu. However, the influence of the acid to intermediate tonstein layers in the Great Northern seam on the geochemistry of the adjacent coals is not as significant as in the Songzao coal seams. Trace elements, such as Li, Th, and U, are relatively high in most of the Great Northern coal plies adjacent to the tonstein bands...|$|R
40|$|Palaeocene high-latitude coals {{from the}} Todalen Mbr. Central Tertiary Basin, Svalbard present an {{opportunity}} to understand the processes which controlled Arctic peat formation. Coals from this region have produced sub-economic quantities of bitumen during the 1920 ’s. Previous palaeogeographic models show significant variation between studies favouring deltaic and tidal wetland conditions. In addition, coal geochemistry studies have been limited to characterisation with little integration with palaeogeographic studies. This study utilises a large database of drill-logs to create cross sections and coal isopach maps to examine the spatial relation between seam thickness and palaeotopography. Palaeotopography is defined by mapping a ‘valley indicator’; the Grønfjorden bed, a fluvial conglomerate representing the first Palaeocene sedimentation. In addition, organic petrology organic and inorganic geochemistry were applied to samples from two mine sections and two boreholes to examine how coal quality and oil potential changed both within and between <b>seams.</b> The cross <b>sections</b> and isopach maps reveal that landscape had a significant but diminishing control upon peat accumulation. Thickest peats consistently formed at the break-in slope whilst topographic lows acted as areas of preferential channel formation and conduits for clastic sedimentation. Evolution of the landscape control had a significant control upon groundwater supply. As landscape control decreased the coals moved from isolated, raised bogs (Svea Seam) to laterally expansive minerotrophic fens (Svarteper and Askeladden Seams). Evidence of increasing marine influence and higher groundwater input was also observed from the Svea Seams to the Askeladden seam. In the Svea Nord and Longyear seam, supply of lithophile elements (Al, Ti, Na, K) is shown {{to be controlled by}} dust supply controlled by orbital cyclicity. By the Svarteper/Askeladden period lithophile element concentrations are controlled by clastic supply. Ca, Mg and Fe appear to be derived from groundwater. Sulfur concentration primarily reflects the supply of marine sulfur. Upper Todalen coals (Longyear, Svarteper and Askeladden) have significantly more oil potential than the Svea Seams with estimated retorting yields of 170 - 190 kg/ton vs. 50 kg/ton respectively. The Longyear seam exhibits relatively high HI values (ca. 300 - 400 mg/g TOC) consistent with a mixed Type II/III kerogen source. Greatest oil potential is shown to be favoured by formation within a fen environment, with high bacterial degradation (> 100 μg/g TOC hopanes), marine influence (> 0. 5 wt% sulfur, Fe/S < 0. 9) and the unique temperate high lattitude Palaeocene climate of Svalbard, leading to preservation of hydrogen rich organic matter via organo-sulfur bond formation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for joining two components of homogeneous and inhomogeneous metallic materials (100, 101) by laser radiation, comprises forming a welding seam (106) along a main path and/or a welding spot at a fixed main position in the area of a joining edge, in which the laser radiation is partially absorbed in an interaction zone and forms a molten bath, covering a part of the joining edge by the molten bath to form a carrying cross-section after hardening a melt, and focusing the laser radiation along the joining edge on a small beam width with a main direction of the laser beam axis relative to normal to a surface of the material. The beam size resulting from the focusing and/or the smallest diameter of the laser beam of the focused laser radiation is held {{in the area of the}} interaction zone forming itself by the laser radiation and material along the joining edge of the materials. The diameter of the laser beam and the welding cavity (105) are slightly adjusted as required carrying cross-section of the welding seam during welding. In addition to the movement along the main path or position during seam/spot welding and the main direction of the laser beam axis in relation to the normal to the surface of the workpiece, the power and direction of the laser beam in relation to the main direction and the position on the surface of the material relative to the positions along the main path or to the main position are set as parameters, so that the welding cavity is guided independently of the main path with varying depth relative to the material thickness, with varying direction relative to the main direction and with varying position along a secondary path, so that a geometric form of the molten bath and the resultant <b>seam</b> cross <b>section</b> are achieved, which determine the local component dimensions along the main path and the resulting internal stresses in the component along the main path in dependence of the joint type. The radius of the laser beam relative to the desired width of the welding is set as a further parameter, so that the ratio (V) of the diameters of the welding seam and cavity or the diameters of the welding spot and the cavity exceeds a minimum value. The smallest cross section of double cone lies nearer to the workpiece surface and opening angle with the power of the laser beam is adjusted. The cross section of the welding seam reaches the carrying cross section along the main path. The length of the welding cavity remains small along the secondary path in comparison to width of the molten bath. The depth of the cavity is changed by controlling the power and/or the path speed and takes different large values by periodically controlling the power. The secondary path is passed through in the form of a curve with double dots. A system from several materials is processed with three layers and the weld connects only the upper two layers. A T-joint having a flange and a bar, the power and the opening angle of the laser beam are adjusted during the welding. The smallest cross-section of the double cone is adjusted on the surface of the flange. The laser beam is guided on the spiral-shaped path with variable radius at the joining edge, which is maximally seized by the full opening angle. A pre-determined value is reached for an angle distortion during welding, in which the opening angle and the depth of the closest cross section are adjusted. The depth is measured from the upper edge of the workpiece. For the angle distortion, the value is reached zero degree, in which the depth of the closest cross section is equally adjusted to the half material thickness and the opening angle is largely adjusted, up to which the actual angle distortion of the material- and laser parameter falls below a predetermined value based on unavoidable fluctuations of the internal stresses in the material. The width of the welding seam and/or the diameters of the welding spot are adjusted to the direction of the laser beam by a tumbling motion around a point in dependence of the distance to the material surface. The temperature in the molten bath is homogeneously kept nearer to the melting temperature with a given distribution and is adjusted to larger values only in a small environment of the welding cavity. The temperature is adjusted in the fixed part of the welding seam behind the molten bath with the given distribution. The laser beam heats the retral part of the molten bath. The effect of the adjustment of the parameters is controlled. The thermal emission of the hot surface of the molten bath and reflections of an additional illuminating source are obtained with a camera. The expansion of the intensive luminescent area of the camera shooting and the intensity of the measuring signal are used to control the actual resulting geometrical form of the molten bath and the additional efficiency of the control. The thermal emission of the hot surface of the molten bath is obtained with a photodiode. The length of the expansion of the intensive luminescent area and the intensity is qualitatively detected by a spatially averaged signal of the photodiode. The secondary path is passed through several times and the movement of the laser beam is superimposed by optical elements, so that the welding seam and/or spot are produced with variable welding seam width over the welding seam depth. A periodically passed secondary path is provided with a semi-major axis towards the main movement and with a semi-minor axis vertical to the main movement. A galvanometer scanner with diffractive optical element is used as optical element. The laser beam axis is bent opposite to the component surface. A rotational movement of the laser beam is carried out around the laser beam axis by optical components. A rotating prism with a torus mirror is used as optical component. USE - Method for joining two components of homogeneous and inhomogeneous metallic materials by laser radiation. ADVANTAGE - The method is capable of economically, accurately and reliably joining the two components with high quality and high strength and stability in less time-consuming manner...|$|R
