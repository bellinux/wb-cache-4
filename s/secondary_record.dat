30|$|Flooding in Dembia {{district}} is a seasonal phenomenon. The {{district is}} situated bordering the biggest lake in Ethiopia–Lake Tana. Several rivers that spring from neighboring districts drain into Lake Tana traversing the district. According {{to the information}} obtained from the district Disasters Prevention and Preparedness Desk, the major cause of flooding in the area {{can be attributed to}} the over-flow of five major rivers namely, Megech, Derema, Nededit, Gumara, and Senzelit during the rainy seasons. According to key informants, these rivers reach at peak flows in the main rainy season starting from July through August with water volume showing declines only in late September. As a result, the rivers regularly inundate many nearby villages with water staying on the plains for several weeks. However, some severe floods have occurred in the past that are associated with heavy rainfall in the highlands. For instance, the floods of 1995 / 96, 2001, and 2006 were mentioned by FGD participants as the most severe flood disasters. <b>Secondary</b> <b>records</b> obtained from DPPA corroborate this information and show that severe floods also occurred much earlier in 1973 / 74 and 1982 / 83 in the district (DPPC, 1997 a).|$|R

Design and setting Population-based electronic health record database linkage between primary care and the sole provider of secondary mental health care services in south east London, UK. Method Cardiovascular disease prevalence, risk factor recording, and Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) clinical target achievement were compared among 4056 primary care patients with SMI whose records were linked to <b>secondary</b> healthcare <b>records</b> and 270 669 patients without SMI who were not known to secondary care psychiatric services, using multivariate logistic regression modelling.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} and {{to compare the}} incidence of tuberculosis in childhood and adolescence in the Paraíba Valley (State of São Paulo, Brazil) in 1993 and 1997. METHOD: Descriptive study with <b>secondary</b> <b>records</b> obtained from the Tuberculosis Division of the Health Department of the State of São Paulo (Divisão de Tuberculose da Secretaria de Saúde de São Paulo). The variables were the type of case, age, form of detection, diagnosis confirmation, clinical presentation, X-ray results, and anti-HIV test results. RESULTS: The global incidence of tuberculosis in all age ranges was of 97. 3 cases/ 100, 000 inhabitants in 1993, and 127. 6 cases/ 100, 000 inhabitants in 1997. In the age group up to 15 years old, there were 93 new cases in 1993, and 68 new cases in 1997, representing an incidence of 11. 7 cases/ 100, 000 inhabitants in 1993 and 7. 9 cases/ 100, 000 inhabitants in 1997. The most common clinical presentation was the pulmonary form; the most important form of detection was by searching communicants; the most frequent diagnosis confirmation was by X-ray, {{and there was an}} increasing number of anti-HIV tests between 1993 and 1997. The distribution by age range was similar to the literature data in both years analyzed.
