5|$|District VI (2007 population: 295,245) covers Pandacan, San Miguel, <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana,</b> Santa Mesa and {{a portion}} of Paco. <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> {{district}} {{is known for its}} 18th Century <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> Church and historic ancestral houses. Polytechnic University of the Philippines is located here, the most populous university in the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|Below Prado Dam, the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River crosses into Orange County, {{and cuts}} between the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> Mountains and Chino Hills via the narrow <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> Canyon. The river roughly bisects the county as it flows {{southwest}} towards the ocean. In Anaheim, the entire {{flow of the}} river (except during wet seasons) is diverted into spreading grounds for groundwater recharge of the north Orange County aquifer, providing {{about half of the}} county's municipal water supply. Downstream of there, the river is mostly confined to a concrete channel, serving only for flood control and urban runoff drainage, and is usually dry or a small trickle. At Orange it receives Santiago Creek from the east before entering <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana.</b> After crossing under Interstate 5 it passes through the River View Golf Course, one of its few non-concreted sections within Orange County, and then becomes a concrete channel again through most of <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> and Fountain Valley to a point below the 405 Freeway, where the river bed becomes natural (though the banks remain concrete). The mouth of the river is located in a small tidal lagoon between Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa, at the northern end of <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River County Beach.|$|E
5|$|Royal Sovereigns main {{opponent}} was {{the large}} Spanish first rate <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana,</b> {{with whom she}} was engaged for several minutes {{at the start of}} the action without support. During this time, Royal Sovereign was at one point engaged with five different enemy ships, and suffered heavy damage and casualties during the engagement, finally subduing the 112-gun <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> after a duel lasting several hours. Both ships were left unmanageable at the end of the engagement, Royal Sovereign being taken in tow by HMS Euryalus into which Collingwood transferred his flag. Royal Sovereign had suffered nearly 150 casualties, <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> over 300 by the end of the battle. <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> was later abandoned by her captors and ultimately fell back into Spanish hands, but Royal Sovereign reached the safety of Gibraltar soon after the battle.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding the {{increased}} prosperity in the 1860s, this decade {{was also the}} scene of a series of natural disasters. In the Great Flood of 1862, heavy rains dropped by a series of winter storms caused the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> to burst its banks, flooding thousands of acres of land and killing 20 to 40 people in the greatest flood it had experienced in recorded history. The levees along the river burst in many places, flooding part of the Inland Empire into a continuous body of water several miles wide stretching from the mouth of <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> Canyon to where the river cuts through the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> Mountains. Downstream in Orange County, the river overwhelmed nearly all the existing floodworks and transformed the coastal plain into a transient inland sea. The flow, now calculated as a 1,000-year flood, peaked at roughly , over half the average flow of the Mississippi River. Even after the flood, detrimental conditions continued in the region. For the two years following the flood, an intense drought caused the deaths {{of tens of thousands of}} head of livestock. Despite all of the hardships experienced in the three years, after conditions finally returned to normal, the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River watershed again became a prospering agricultural region. The cities of <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> and Riverside were established in 1869 and 1870, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The state built a bypass of the Valley Boulevard {{portion of}} the route in the early-to-mid-1930s, leaving the old road near Diamond Bar and heading {{northeast}} through the foothills, along the present freeway alignment and Mission Boulevard. To the south, the legislature added then-unrelated Route180 along State College Boulevard in 1933, connecting Route 2 (I-5) near the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River with Route 175 (Orangethorpe Avenue, later replaced by SR 91) near Placentia. By 1955, the Brea Canyon Freeway was proposed to begin at the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> Freeway (I-5) near La Veta Avenue in <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> and head north, paralleling Routes 180 and 19 to Pomona. The portion northeast of Diamond Bar into Pomona soon {{became part of the}} planned Pomona Freeway, {{and the name of the}} remainder was changed to Orange Freeway. The state legislature altered the definition of Route19 to reflect this in 1957 by moving its south end to <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1860, a {{much closer}} gold rush {{occurred}} in the San Bernardino Mountains when prospector William Holcomb discovered significant deposits, just over the northern drainage divide of the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River. This discovery exploded into a full-scale gold mining operation in days. The <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River served as a conduit for miners traveling to the region {{and many of the}} forests in the upper basin experienced clearcutting {{as a result of the}} high resource demands of the boom. Gold was also discovered in Lytle Creek in that same year. Following the gold rush, the cultivation of citrus became the mainstay of the economy of the lower <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River area. Through the late 19th century, citrus fields covered much of the coastal plain and led to the naming of Orange County.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, a 16-hour, 11-cassette {{recording}} read by John MacDonald {{was published}} by Books on Tape, Inc. of <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana,</b> CA.|$|E
5|$|Meyer {{was born}} on August 3, 1952 in Hamilton, Ohio. He {{attended}} Mater Dei High School in <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana,</b> California. In 1970, Meyer {{was inducted into the}} school's baseball hall of fame. Meyer spent one year (1971) at the University of Arizona. In 1972, Meyer enrolled in <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> College where he played second base on the school's baseball team. He was selected by the Detroit Tigers during the fourth round of the 1972 Major League Baseball draft.|$|E
5|$|Perennial and {{seasonal}} streams often {{are lined with}} live oak and sycamore, which transition into the riparian zones of the main stem <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River. The inland riparian marshes upstream of the Riverside/Orange County line, although degraded by pollution, have otherwise been mostly left in their natural state. Although much of the riparian system along the river has been degraded, {{one of the largest}} places where it occurs is the enormous marsh behind Prado Dam, an area closed to development because it functions as a flood control basin, similar to the Sepulveda Dam. The <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> sucker, a small bottom-dwelling fish, once was found throughout riparian zones, but now is rarely seen in the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River drainage. Near the mouth, the river was once abundant in salt marshes, which stretched for miles {{on either side of the}} river, even near Upper Newport Bay, which has also served as an alternate mouth of the river.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River has 70 {{significant}} crossings, {{bridges and}} dams. This list places them from mouth to source.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> {{drainage}} basin has {{a diversity of}} terrain, ranging from high peaks of inland mountains {{in the north and}} east, to the hot, dry interior and semi-desert basins of the Inland Empire, to the flat coastal plain of Orange County. Although it includes areas of alpine and highland forest, the majority of the watershed consists of arid desert and chaparral environments. Due to low regional rainfall, the river carries only a small flow except during the brief winter season, when it is prone to massive flash floods. The San Jacinto River, which drains the southern half of the watershed, rarely reaches the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> except in extremely wet years. However, a wide variety of animal and plant communities depend on the riparian zones and remnant wetlands along the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{recreational}} opportunities along the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River. The <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River watershed includes {{parts of the}} Cleveland National Forest, San Bernardino National Forest, Angeles National Forest, Mount San Jacinto State Wilderness Area, Chino Hills State Park, and Lake Perris State Recreation Area. Big Bear Lake, Lake Elsinore, and Lake Irvine are popular recreational lakes in the watershed. The river never actually flows through any of these lakes, but they each have drainage to the river via tributaries.|$|E
5|$|When the California Republic was assimilated {{into the}} United States in 1848, American {{settlers}} {{began to move}} into the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River region in great numbers. The Mexican ranchos were divided into smaller individual properties, and irrigated agriculture began on a large scale. The city of <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> Viejo, the original location of <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana,</b> was founded in this period. In 1854, Mormons settled in the upper Inland Empire area and started the city of San Bernardino, gaining prosperity by using water from the river, as well as Lytle Creek and Mill Creek, to irrigate crops. The cattle industry began to decline as farms began to replace ranches. Soon, white settlers in the region were more numerous than Hispanics as well. The California Gold Rush around this time was responsible for attracting many of these people to the state, but many remained in Southern California afterwards.|$|E
5|$|A {{predecessor}} to {{this road}} ran through Brea Canyon {{by the early}} 20th century and {{was added to the}} state highway system. The freeway was built in stages during the 1950s, one of which included the Brea Canyon Freeway; SR57 was designated as part of the 1964 state highway renumbering. The final portion of the present-day Orange Freeway was not completed until the mid 1970s. The latest piece of SR57 to be added was formerly part of I-210, after SR210 was legislatively extended to San Bernardino in 1998. An unconstructed extension from <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> south to Huntington Beach remains in the legal definition of SR57, and has been studied as a toll road above the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River.|$|E
5|$|In April2009, the Orange County Transportation Authority {{continued}} {{to study the}} extension of SR57, where the freeway would travel along the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River and terminate at I-405 in Fountain Valley.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1840s, California fought for its {{independence}} from Mexico in the Mexican–American War. The <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> river played {{an important part in}} the victory of the Americans over the Mexican army. In 1847, one year after the Bear Flag Revolt, a Mexican military force set out northwards to attack a smaller American force in the Los Angeles area. However, the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River flooded, preventing the Mexicans from crossing the river to attack the Americans. When the river's flow finally subsided, the American forces had been reinforced enough to drive the Mexicans out of the region.|$|E
5|$|On November 21, 2016, Rodman {{was charged}} with causing a hit and run accident, lying to police, and driving without a license {{following}} an incident on Interstate 5 near <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana,</b> California, in July.|$|E
5|$|SR55 {{continues}} {{north into}} Orange, where it meets the eastern terminus of SR22. Following this, the freeway continues almost due north until turning northeast {{to merge with}} SR91 eastbound, and intersecting ramps for SR91 westbound near the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River {{watershed}} shares boundaries {{with many}} adjacent river basins. In the northwest is the San Gabriel River, which empties into the Pacific at Long Beach. In Orange County, the San Diego Creek, Aliso Creek, and San Juan Creek watersheds border the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> watershed on the south. Further south, in San Diego County, the watershed is bordered {{by those of}} San Mateo Creek, the Santa Margarita River, and the San Luis Rey River. On the east the watershed shares borders {{with those of the}} Whitewater River and the Coachella Valley, flowing into the Salton Sea, and on the north with the Mojave River, which flows into the endorheic basin of the Mojave Desert.|$|E
5|$|With the {{increased}} flood protection {{afforded by the}} Prado Dam, major industrial development migrating south from the Los Angeles Basin, and the Southern California housing boom in the 1950s and 1960s, the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River watershed began its third and final transition—from agricultural to urban. The population of the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River basin increased dramatically, but brought with it the threat of greater damage from floods, somewhat compromising the protection afforded by Prado Dam. Because housing and urban areas encroached on the river's historic floodplain—an area once occupied by farms—and the river became confined to a narrow channel—a flood {{similar to the ones}} surrounding the turn of the 20th century would cause much more damage. The construction of roads and buildings also heightened the runoff that would flow into the river during rainfall, a process known as urban runoff. In fact, the river flooded again in 1969, and while much of the runoff from the Inland Empire was captured behind Prado Dam—probably saving Orange County from an even greater flood—Santiago Creek, a large tributary flowing from the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> Mountains, eroded its banks until it swept away portions of residential communities in the cities of Tustin and Orange.|$|E
5|$|In 1899, {{two teams}} from <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> and San Salvador {{met for the}} first known {{football}} game in El Salvador. The national team's first match was played in September 1921, when they were invited to participate in a tournament to celebrate 100 years of Central American Independence.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the large number of}} people killed during this time, over 100,000people were forced to evacuate. The eruption of the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> Volcano on October 1 contributed to the destruction in Central America {{as a result of the}} floods and mudslides caused.|$|E
5|$|Most of Southern California, {{including}} all of Orange County, was periodically {{part of the}} Pacific Ocean; the most recent epoch was approximately 10million years ago (MYA). The <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> Mountains, which now border the creek {{to the north and}} east, began their uplift about 5.5million years ago along the Elsinore Fault.|$|E
5|$|On September 9, 2017, {{while on}} {{tour in the}} United States, all {{four members of the}} band were arrested in <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana,</b> California after {{allegedly}} kidnapping and raping a woman after their show in Spokane, Washington on August 31. Subsequently, all future touring plans were cancelled while the investigation is ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the last}} 150 years, this layout has been {{replaced}} by the usual Spanish colonial architecture of large square blocks with internal patios. Remnants of the initial design can still be seen in San Miguel de Velasco, San Rafael de Velasco and <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> de Velasco, places that were not as much exposed to modernization as the other settlements.|$|E
5|$|Several major premodern Native American groups {{eventually}} {{gained control}} of lands along the river: the Yuhaviatam or Yuharetum people in the upper basin, the Payomkowishum in the southeastern basin, the Cahuilla in the desert areas of the watershed, and the Tongva people in the lower basin. The Yuhaviatam generally lived in the mountain headwaters of the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River and its tributaries rimming the present-day Inland Empire basin, in present-day San Bernardino County, {{as well as in}} the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains. The Tongva lived on the flat coastal plains of present-day Orange County south of the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> Mountains. They were also the larger of the two groups, controlling all the coastal lands from the San Gabriel Mountains in the north to Aliso Creek in the south, including all of the Los Angeles Basin.|$|E
5|$|The city {{is made up}} of {{fourteen}} city districts, according to Republic Act No. 409—the Revised Charter of the City of Manila—the basis of which officially sets the present-day boundary of the city. Two were later added, which are Santa Mesa (partitioned off from Sampaloc) and San Andres (partitioned off from <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana).</b>|$|E
5|$|The musical {{festivals and}} concerts held {{regularly}} in the Chiquitos formermission towns testify to the living heritage of this art form. Some of the original instruments and sculptures made by Fr. Martin Schmid and his apprentices survive in small museums in the mission towns, most notably in Concepción which also houses the music archive. In San Xavier, San Rafael de Velasco and <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> de Velasco three original harps {{from the time of}} the Jesuits are preserved. The church in <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> de Vealsco also houses the only original organ in Chiquitos, transported there from Potosí by mule, accompanied by Schmid in 1751. More than a dozen orchestras and choirs brought together by the Sistema de Coros y Orquestas (SICOR) dot the area.|$|E
5|$|The southerly {{extension}} to Huntington Beach remains unconstructed. In 1986, Orange County's plans were for a toll road elevated above the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River {{rather than through}} existing neighborhoods, only extending south to the San Diego Freeway (I-405) in Costa Mesa with connections to the Corona del Mar Freeway (SR 73); this was largely inspired by congestion on SR 55 through the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> area. The extension was considered by Caltrans as two 11.2-mile-long (18.0km), two-lane viaducts that would cost $950 million. The toll road franchise that American Transportation Development (ATD) held for this portion of SR 57 expired in January2001, after a request to delay the expiration until January2007. Following this, ATD sued to restore the franchise, and this case lasted until November2003. The termination was due to ATD not beginning the construction during the first ten years of the franchise, after it had been enacted by the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|When Spanish {{explorer}} Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo sailed {{along the}} Southern California coast on his voyage of 1542, {{he passed the}} mouth of the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River without noting it. Neither did any of the subsequent Spanish sea-borne explorers leave any written notice of the river mouth.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} on the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River for at least 9,000 years. In the period {{immediately}} before and during European colonization, there were four distinct indigenous groups in the area. The river was first seen by Europeans in 1769, when it received its name {{from members of the}} Spanish Portola expedition. Because {{it was one of the}} only reliable sources of water in a wide region, many large ranchos developed along the river and one of its major tributaries, Santiago Creek. After the area became part of the United States, the economy transitioned to agriculture, before urbanizing in the 20th century. Many cities established during this time including <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana,</b> Riverside and Anaheim derived their names from the river. In order to protect urban areas from the river's flood threat, major channelization and damming projects were undertaken in the 20th century, resulting in the loss of much of the natural river channel.|$|E
5|$|SR57 {{begins at}} the Orange Crush {{interchange}} near downtown Orange, where it meets the northwest–southeast <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> Freeway (I-5) and the east–west Garden Grove Freeway (SR22). The Orange Crush interchange, which had long been considered a major bottleneck, was rebuilt in the 1990s and 2000s. The freeway heads north from the junction and soon crosses to {{the west side of}} the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River, continuing north through suburban portions of Anaheim and passing next to Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center, Angel Stadium and Honda Center. In northern Anaheim, SR57 meets the Riverside Freeway (SR 91). SR57 briefly passes through Placentia and Fullerton, providing access to California State University, Fullerton. As it crosses Imperial Highway (SR 90) near the Brea Mall and enters Brea, SR57 enters more rugged terrain before climbing through Brea Canyon, the gap between the Chino Hills and Puente Hills. Near the rim of the canyon, the highway curves north out of the Brea Canyon, and descends slightly to a junction with the Pomona Freeway (SR 60) in Diamond Bar, right on the edge of the San Gabriel Valley.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> Register {{published}} its article, {{a nationwide}} network of activists began a vociferous campaign to torpedo the Alaska Mental Health Bill. The campaigners included, among other groups and individuals, the white supremacist Rev. Gerald L. K. Smith; Women for God and Country; the For America League; the Minute Women of the U.S.A.; the right-wing agitator Dan Smoot; the anti-Catholic former US Army Brigadier General Herbert C. Holdridge; and L. Ron Hubbard's Church of Scientology, {{which had been}} founded only two years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{was born}} in Mission Viejo, California on June 24, 1986, and {{attended}} Foothill High School in <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana,</b> California, {{where he was a}} first-team High School All-American pitcher and had one perfect game. In his junior year (2003), he had a 12–0 record and posted an 0.78 earned run average (ERA) while striking out 85 batters in 72 innings. In his senior year (2004), he had an 0.69 ERA and a 9–1 record. In 61 innings, he gave up 41 hits and three walks while striking out 83 batters.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds {{of species}} {{of animals and}} plants {{characterize}} the <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> River's diversity of climates and vegetation zones. There are over ten of these vegetation zones in the watershed—including the sparsely vegetated alpine and subalpine zones in the mountains, mid-elevation forests of pine, lodgepole and oak, chaparral, coastal sage scrub, the increasingly rare riparian forest and marshes along the river bed, lined with trees and rushes, and the thinly vegetated coastal areas virtually flush with sea level. The watershed supports up to 200 bird species, fifty mammal species, 13 reptile species, 7 amphibian species, and 15 fish species, including steelhead trout.|$|E
5|$|Some Jesuit {{institutions}} {{still exist}} in the Chiquitania. For example, the towns of San Rafael de Velasco, San Miguel de Velasco, <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> de Velasco and San Ignacio de Velasco have functioning town councils (cabildos), and the caciques and the sexton still retain their capacities. The {{majority of the population}} of the Chiquitania is staunchly Catholic; the Chiquitano cosmovision is now only a dimly understood mythology for its inhabitants. Between 1992 and 2009, the populations of San Xavier and especially Concepción tripled, and more than doubled in San Ignacio de Velasco, now the region’s fastest-growing municipality. In other mission towns the population also increased, albeit on a smaller scale. As of 2011, San José de Chiquitos, San Xavier and Concepción have around 10,000inhabitants each; and San Ignacio de Velasco, the largest town in the Chiquitania, has about 35,000 and is now boasts a campus of a national university. On the other hand, in <b>Santa</b> <b>Ana</b> de Velasco there are currently only a few hundred people. The remoter settlements of Santiago de Chiquitos and Santo Corazón are quite small as well. According to various sources, in Bolivia the number of ethnic Chiquitanos is between 30,000 and 47,000 of which less than 6,000– mainly elderly people– still speak the original language. Only a few hundred are monolingual in the Chiquitano language.|$|E
