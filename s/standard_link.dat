50|$|An {{example of}} how ARINC 818 transmits color XGA {{provides}} a good overview. XGA RGB requires ~141M bytes/s of data transfer (1024 pixels x 3 bytes per pixel x 768 lines x 60 Hz). Adding the protocol overhead and blanking time, a <b>standard</b> <b>link</b> rate of 2.125Gbit/s is required. ARINC 818 “packetizes” video images into Fibre Channel frames. Each FC frame begins with a 4 byte ordered set, called an SOF (Start of Frame), and ends with an EOF (End of Frame), additionally, a 4 byte CRC is included for data integrity. The payload of the first FC frame in a sequence contains embedded header data that accompanies each video image.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{previous}} SOC projects had had only limited success (the M212 {{was in fact}} sold for a time), many designers still firmly believed in the concept and in 1987, a new project, the T100 was started which combined an 8-bit version of the transputer CPU with configurable logic based on state machines. The transputer instruction set is based on 8-bit instructions and can easily be used with any word size which is a multiple of 8 bits. The target market for the T100 was to be bus controllers such as Futurebus, {{as well as an}} upgrade for the <b>standard</b> <b>link</b> adapters (C011 etc.). The project was stopped when the T840 (later to become the basis of the T9000) was started.|$|E
50|$|The Majura Parkway {{traverses}} {{the length}} of the largely rural Majura Valley within the ACT, providing a parkway <b>standard</b> <b>link</b> between the northern terminus of the Monaro Highway in territory's east and the Federal Highway at the north close to the New South Wales border. The parkway largely replaced Majura Road, which was formerly the main route through the valley and carried approximately 18,000 vehicles each day. Majura Road is single carriageway, and rural in design and quality; the need for the replacement with a more efficient, higher capacity roadway was highlighted in several studies. Majura Road remains largely intact to serve local traffic to various facilities located in the Majura Valley, multiple rural properties and Canberra Airport's business precinct. Other benefits of the Majura Parkway include more efficient freight transportation, relieving traffic congestion, supporting future growth of Canberra Airport, and easier movement between Canberra's northern and southern suburbs.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the arrival}} of the Flexity trams in 2005, H1 type car 381 was the most modern tram in Adelaide.Originally part of an order for 40 H1 type cars, 381 was just {{completed}} by JA Lawton & Sons of Adelaide when the reconstitution of the MTT caused cancellation of the remaining thirty-nine cars. A partly constructed 382 was scrapped before it was completed {{as a result of the}} change in policy. Like the H type upon which 381 was based on, it was fitted with PC5L2 type controllers although in this case, they were taken out of F1 type tram 264 (more details to be found in the F1 type section). Originally fitted with a <b>standard</b> <b>link</b> and pin type coupler, 381 was later fitted with a Tomlinson automatic style coupler (although it was not able to operate in multiple with the H type). Power operated doors were also fitted.|$|E

50|$|The TI-84 Plus {{series was}} {{introduced}} in April 2004 as a further update to the TI-83 Plus line. Despite the new appearance, {{there are very few}} actual changes. The main improvements of the TI-84 Plus and TI-84 Plus Silver Edition are a modernized case design, changeable faceplates (Silver Edition only), a few new functions, more speed and memory, a clock, and USB port connectivity. The TI-84 Plus also has a brighter screen with a clearer contrast, though this caused a bug with the LCD driver in some calculators sold. The TI-84 Plus has 3 times the memory of the TI-83 Plus, and the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition has 9 times the memory of the TI-83 Plus. They both have 2.5 times the speed of the TI-83 Plus. The operating system and math functionality remain essentially the same, as does the <b>standard</b> <b>link</b> port for connecting {{with the rest of the}} TI calculator series.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a number of}} authors (Brosius, 1992; Mack, 1993, 1994; and Murphy, 1994) have shown that link ratio {{techniques}} for loss reserving {{can be regarded as}} weighted regressions of a certain kind.

The new 'extended link ratio family ' (ELRF) of regression models is used to test the assumptions made by the <b>standard</b> <b>link</b> ratio techniques and compare their predictive power with modelling (trends in) the incremental data. Not only does the ELRF of regression models indicate that for most, if not all, cumulative arrays the assumptions made by the <b>standard</b> <b>link</b> ratio techniques are not satisfied by the data, but that modelling the trends in the (log) incremental data has more predictive power.
