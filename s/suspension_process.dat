The independent decomposition of two series of loess grain-size records from the NE Tibetan Plateau and Loess Plateau spanning the last glacial-interglacial cycle indicates that the two data sets are described by very similar mixing models. The average mixing model presented here is regarded as representative for the vast loess region in northern China and allows quantification of the contribution of three loess components to the loess grain-size distributions. A genetic interpretation and the paleoclimatic significance of the average mixing model have been provided by comparison of the modeled loess components with modern dust samples in terms of their grain-size distribution and flux rates, and by the distribution patterns of the loess components across the Loess Plateau reconstructed for the last two glacial-interglacial cycles. The sandy and silty loess components represent the coarse dust fraction supplied by saltation and short-term <b>suspension</b> <b>processes</b> over the proximal part of the Loess Plateau during major dust outbreaks in spring and early summer.

The clayey loess component in the glacial loess deposits is dominantly supplied during major dust outbreaks by the northwesterly winter monsoon, whereas the clayey loess component in the interglacial paleosols is mainly supplied by non-dust-storm processes, possibly with a significant contribution by the high-level subtropical jet stream (westerly winds).

40|$|PVC {{has a large}} sales volume, {{second only}} to polyethylene. Its high {{chlorine}} content provides it with {{a very high level}} of combustion resistance for building products, electrical enclosures, and wire & cable insulation. PVC has a unique ability to be compounded {{with a wide variety of}} additives, making it possible to produce materials in a range from flexible elastomers to rigid compounds, materials that are weatherable such as for siding and windows, compounds that have stiff melts and little elastic recovery for outstanding dimensional control useful in profile extrusion, or low viscosity melts which compete effectively with ABS and PC/ABS in thin walled injection molding parts such as computer monitor housings. Some of PVC’s properties are attributed to unique structures. The polymer precipitates from its monomer and grows into primary particles, which are later the melt flow units. Fusion into larger structures and product strength are controlled by break-down of the grains into primary particles, by the choice of additives, by the amount of melting (temperature), and by the number of tie molecules (molecular weight). The main type of polymerization is the <b>suspension</b> <b>process,</b> with significant polymerization made by the mass process and emulsion process. In the <b>suspension</b> <b>process,</b> the polymerization takes place in droplets of monomer suspended in a water. PVC is environmentally sound.

Analysis from 155 large-scale, commercial incinerator facilities, found no relationship between the chlorine content of waste nor the addition of PVC, and dioxin emissions from combustion processes.
