Note should be taken that the <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> arises at confluence between the business field and the social field, insofar the <b>social</b> <b>economy's</b> primary aim is not the profit making but the stakeholders’ welfare and socio-economic inclusion. This paper shall tackel primarily the added value of <b>social</b> <b>economy,</b> which shall be considered {{in terms of social}} and economic benefits for local development and benefits related to sistemic and institutional modification. Documentary research shall be used as a method in order to assess the added value of <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> for local development and social cohesion. The <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> contributes to developing a <b>social</b> cohesion-generating <b>economy</b> forming new mentalities for the local social-economical environment. Main definitions proposed for <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> and main financind sources relevand for the Romanian <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> development shall be reviewed. The three main <b>categories</b> of <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> stakeholders shall be analised: public authorities, third sector, and businesses. Conclusions shall be drawn related to <b>social</b> <b>economy's</b> implications for society and general economy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} a general {{framework}} and taxonomy {{within which the}} BC-Alberta <b>Social</b> <b>Economy</b> Research Alliance could define a focus for its initial approach to mapping of the <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada.

What are the arenas of work that characterise the bulk of the work undertaken by <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> organisations? The approach to mapping advocated in the paper is intended to strategically facilitate a convergence of policy, practitioner and research interests consistent with the overall goal of BALTA: to strengthen the foundations of the <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> in BC and Alberta.

40|$|In January 2008 the BC-Alberta <b>Social</b> <b>Economy</b> Research Alliance (BALTA) {{launched}} its <b>Social</b> <b>Economy</b> Survey, {{as part of}} its Portraiture and Mapping project. The survey consists of an online questionnaire and is housed at Athabasca University. It is designed to compile an inventory of <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> actors and organizations in BC and Alberta in order to provide general data on the scope and scale of the sector including evidence of its economic, social and environmental significance. The survey is an ongoing endeavour. It will stay active {{for the duration of the}} mapping project until 2011. The survey is open to any organizations and actors that are part of the <b>social</b> <b>economy.</b> The BC-Alberta <b>Social</b> <b>Economy</b> Research Alliance (BALTA) is a regional collaboration of organizations engaged in research initiatives to strengthen the foundations of the <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> in western Canada. Undertaken by the BALTA mapping team, a <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> survey is aimed at identifying the scope and characteristics of the <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> in BC and Alberta.

40|$|The {{research}} scope includes municipal {{governments in}} the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario (northwestern portion of the province). This plan/proposal describes research being conducted by the BC-Alberta <b>Social</b> <b>Economy</b> Research Alliance (BALTA) {{in association with the}} Saskatchewan/Manitoba/Northwestern Ontario node of the Canadian <b>Social</b> <b>Economy</b> Research Partnerships. The {{purpose of this study is}} to research the current state of municipal government involvement in and support of the <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> sector. The <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> sector can offer innovative responses to the complex social and economic challenges that municipalities face. As the level of government closest to people and communities, municipal governments can play a lead role in supporting the <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> sector.

40|$|During {{the past}} 20 years, <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> became {{a subject of}} {{interest}} because its organisations had to assume an increasing role in the production and supply of social goods and services of public interest. In Romania, although forms of <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> existed {{for a very long}} time in society, we can not speak of an institutionally or juridical determined area, with actual outputs. This study 5 shows the stage of <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> development taking into consideration three forms of <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> which are present in Romania: the cooperatives, the non-governmental organisations and the mutual aid organisations. The three types of organisations have a low potential for <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> activities. There is no specific legislative framework which to encourage the development of <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> activities, while the availability of the public institutions to support the organisations addressing the vulnerable groups is very limited. The cases in which the three forms of <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> address directly the higher employment of the disadvantaged groups are rather isolated. As a general characteristic, except for the NGOs, the other types of <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> organisations address indirectly the disadvantaged groups, without any kind of coherent supply of services. <b>social</b> <b>economy,</b> mutual aid, cooperatives, non-profit organisations, mutual aid organisations, vulnerable groups, social inclusion...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to provide a}} clear perspective on defining the <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> today. It addresses {{the question of the}} relevance of a unifying concept with its need to embrace the existing diversity of approaches and concepts. To this end, it surveys both historical and contemporary academic literature, as well as practice-rooted conceptualisations of the <b>social</b> <b>economy.</b> The first section outlines the analytical challenges to a reconstruction of the <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> concept. The second enhances the historical and space-bound diversity in theorising and institutionalising <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> practices. Section 3 focuses on contemporary reconceptualisations of the <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> in Francophone and Anglo-Saxon literature, while section 4 then suggests improvements to current `social economy' concepts, by linking them to both the lessons of history and the views of <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> practitioners today. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> is an {{extremely}} present topic.

We consider that the three ideological sources of the <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> (socialist, liberal and Christian) have fully contributed to create a responsive availability toward the <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> from east to west. Moreover, we believe that beyond these ideological resources the collective mentality and the human’s mentality values solidarity, community, common interest,etc, this being an advantage in developing and applying some models of <b>social</b> <b>economy.</b> At {{the basis of these}} values and concepts promoted by the <b>social</b> <b>economy</b> we find work in its concrete forms and values (either of religious nature or ideologically assumed) ...|$|R
