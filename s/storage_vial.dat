40|$|Aim: This {{in vitro}} study was {{designed}} to investigate the effects of daily fluoride exposures on fluoride release and recharge by prereacted glass ionomer (PRG) composite and nano-ionomeric glass ionomer. Materials and Methods: Seventy-two specimens (36 of each material) were prepared and by placing the restorative materials into Teflon mold. Each specimen was subjected to one of three daily treatments (n = 12) : (1) No fluoride treatment (control); (2) application of a fluoride dentifrice (1, 000 ppm) once daily; and (3) the same regimen as (2), plus immersion in a 0. 05 % sodium fluoride (NaF) mouth rinse (225 ppm) immediately following the dentifrice application. Specimens were suspended in a <b>storage</b> <b>vial</b> containing 10 ml demineralizing solution for 6 h and transferred to a new test tube containing 10 ml remineralizing solution for 18 h. Fluoride treatments of the specimens were completed every day prior to their immersion in the demineralizing solution. Media solutions were buffered with equal volumes of total ionic strength adjustment buffer (TISAB) II; fluoride levels were measured using a digital ion analyzer and fluoride electrode throughout the 21 day duration of the experiment. Results: Nano-ionomeric glass ionomer showed a better amount of fluoride release than PRG composite irrespective of the fluoride treatment supplementation (P < 0. 01). Additional fluoride supplementation improved fluoride release and recharge ability for both the materials when compared to their respective control groups. The fluoride recharge for both materials did not show any sustained pattern of release. Conclusion: Nano-ionomeric glass ionomer demonstrated a greater ability to release and recharge compared with that of PRG composite...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the analysis of microfossils from deep-sea sediments. I am investigating a series of deep-sea sediment cores from the South Pacific. The cores are a vertical timeline of sedimentation, with each centimeter layer representing approximately 1, 000 to 5, 000 years of deposition. I subsampled each core by removing 10 cc of sediment every 150 cm. Each subsample spans 2 cm. After recording the mass of each sample, I washed and agitated each in purified water and sodium metaphosphate (disaggregant) solution to break up any clays adhering to the fragile fossil material. After rinsing over a 63 ?m sieve, the samples were dried, and then transferred to a <b>storage</b> <b>vial.</b> Each sample was examined under a low-power binocular microscope to identify and quantify the assemblage of microfossils. I also analyzed the microfossil specimens using the scanning electron microscope to aid in identification and capture images of the important specimens. Results document changes {{in the composition of}} microfossil shells and faunal assemblages through time. In general, the dominant sediment lithology is red clay. However, several cores contain evidence of significant sediment variability through time. Typically, South Pacific deep waters are corrosive to calcium carbonate, so the preservation of carbonate fossils in the sediments reflects intervals of anomalous ocean chemistry that in turn may reflect changes in atmospheric CO? inventories. These results show that over a relatively short geologic period, the ocean level at the coring site fluctuated between shallower nutrient rich waters and deeper carbonate rich waters. Future work, in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Michigan and Boise State University, will focus on more precise determinations of the sediment layer ages and geochemical analyses of the microfossils to determine ancient oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns...|$|E

40|$|Background: Alterations in {{intestinal}} microbiota have been correlated {{with a growing}} number of diseases. Investigating the faecal microbiota is widely used as a non-invasive and ethically simple proxy for intestinal biopsies. There is an urgent need for collection and transport media that would allow faecal sampling at distance from the processing laboratory, obviating the need for same-day DNA extraction recommended by previous studies of freezing and processing methods for stool. We compared the faecal bacterial DNA quality and apparent phylogenetic composition derived using a commercial kit for stool storage and transport (DNA Genotek OMNIgene GUT) with that of freshly extracted samples, 22 from infants and 20 from older adults. Results: Use of the <b>storage</b> <b>vials</b> increased the quality of extracted bacterial DNA by reduction of DNA shearing. When infant and elderly datasets were examined separately, no differences in microbiota composition were observed due to storage. When the two datasets were combined, there was a difference according to a Wilcoxon test in the relative proportions of Faecalibacterium, Sporobacter, Clostridium XVIII, and Clostridium XlVa after 1 week 2 ̆ 7 s storage compared to immediately extracted samples. After 2 weeks 2 ̆ 7 storage, Bacteroides abundance was also significantly different, showing an apparent increase from week 1 to week 2.

40|$|Bone {{morphogenetic}} protein- 2 (BMP- 2) {{is considered}} a promising adjuvant {{for the treatment of}} bone regeneration. However, BMP- 2 delivery in a conventional collagen scaffold needs a high dose to achieve an effective outcome. Moreover, such dosage may lead to serious side effects. The aim of the following thesis was to find clinically acceptable strategies reducing the required dose of BMP- 2 by improving the delivery and optimizing the preclinical testing of the new approaches. In all the studies hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels was used as a carrier for BMP- 2. The HA hydrogel/BMP- 2 construct was modified with bioactive matrix components in order to obtain an effective release of BMP- 2 and an enhanced bone formation. The most promising were two strategies. In the first one, BMP- 2, precomplexed with the glycosaminoglycans dermatan sulfate or heparin prior to loading it into HA hydrogel, protected and prolonged the delivery of the protein, resulting in twofold larger bone formation in comparison to non-complexed BMP- 2. In the second strategy, the fibronectin fragment integrin-binding domain (FN) was covalently incorporated into HA hydrogel. The FN remarkably improved the capacity of the material to support the cells attachment and spreading, providing the formation of twice as much bone in comparison to non-functionalized HA hydrogel/BMP- 2. Furthermore, the importance of a proper design of the preclinical study for BMP- 2 delivery systems was highlighted. Firstly, proper physicochemical handling of BMP- 2 showed the improvement in further in vivo activity.   The use of glass <b>storage</b> <b>vials</b> and an acidic formulation buffer was superior to plastic surfaces and physiological pH. Secondly, while regenerative medicine strategy testing required the use of animal models that matched the research questions related to clinical translation, two new animal models were developed. The subperiosteal mandibular and calvarial models in rats were found to be minimally invasive, convenient and rapid solution for the evaluation of a broad range of approaches including bone augmentation, replacement and regeneration. Both models are primarily relevant for the initial testing of the injectable bone engineering constructs.   Those clinically translatable approaches presented here could prove to be a powerful platform for a wider use of BMP- 2 in orthopedic, plastic surgery and regenerative medicine research...|$|R

40|$|The {{body of work}} {{presented}} in this thesis are in three main parts: [1] the effect of ultrasound on freezing events of ionic systems, [2] the importance of formulation osmolality in freeze drying, and [3] a novel system for increasing primary freeze drying rate. Chapter 4 briefly presents the work on method optimisation, which {{is still very much}} in its infancy. Aspects of freezing such as nucleation and ice crystal growth are strongly related with ice crystal morphology; however, the ice nucleation process typically occurs in a random, non-deterministic and spontaneous manner. In view of this, ultrasound, an emerging application in pharmaceutical sciences, has been applied to aid in the acceleration of nucleation and shorten the freezing process. The research {{presented in}} this thesis aimed to study the effect of sonication on nucleation events in ionic solutions, and more importantly how sonication impacts on the freezing process. This work confirmed that nucleation does occur in a random manner. It also showed that ultrasonication aids acceleration of the ice nucleation process and increases the freezing rate of a solution. Cryopreservation of animal sperm is an important aspect of breeding in animal science especially for endangered species. In order for sperm cryopreservation to be successful, cryoprotectants as well as semen extenders are used. One of the factors allowing semen preservation media to be optimum is the osmolality of the semen extenders used. Although preservation of animal sperm has no relation with freeze drying of pharmaceuticals, it was used in this thesis to make a case for considering the osmolality of a formulation (prepared for freeze drying) as a factor for conferring protein protection against the stresses of freeze drying. The osmolalities of some common solutes (mostly sugars) used in freeze drying were determined (molal concentration from 0. 1 m to 1. 2 m). Preliminary investigation on the osmolality and osmotic coefficients of common solutes were carried out. It was observed that the osmotic coefficient trend for the sugars analysed could be grouped based on the types of sugar they are. The trends observed show the need for further studies to be carried out with osmolality and to determine how it may be of importance to protein or API protection during freeze drying processes. Primary drying is usually the longest part of the freeze drying process, and primary drying times lasting days or even weeks are not uncommon; however, longer primary drying times lead to longer freeze drying cycles, and consequently increased production costs. Much work has been done previously by others using different processes (such as annealing) in order to improve primary drying times; however, these do not come without drawbacks. A novel system involving the formation of a frozen vial system which results {{in the creation of a}} void between the formulation and the inside wall of a vial has been devised to increase the primary freeze drying rate of formulations without product damage. Although the work is not nearly complete, it has been shown that it is possible to improve and increase the primary drying rate of formulations without making any modifications to existing formulations, changing <b>storage</b> <b>vials,</b> or increasing the surface area of freeze dryer shelves...|$|R

40|$|RATIONALE: Recent studies {{indicate}} that plants can partition electron transport through alternative oxidase (AOX) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in response to environmental cues, thus modulating respiratory efficiency. The ¹⁸O discrimination method necessary for measuring electron partitioning in vivo, however, has been restricted to laboratory settings due to equipment constraints. Since plants grown in more natural and variable environments may not respond as predicted by laboratory experiments, I developed a new field-compatible analytical method and then applied it to three ecophysiological studies. METHODS: To address these needs, I developed a field-compatible method in which plant tissue was incubated in 12 mL septum-capped vials for 0. 5 – 3 h, after which the incubation air was transferred to 3. 7 mL <b>storage</b> <b>vials</b> for subsequent measurement by mass spectrometry. I also developed mathematical tools to correct for unavoidable contamination, and to detect and address curvature in the data – whether intrinsic to the respiration or due to contamination, – and to extend the usable dynamic range of the mass spectrometer. These methods were used to investigate respiratory responses (1) in canopy trees growing across a soil nutrient gradient at the Franz Josef chronosequence, New Zealand; (2) in a nutrient manipulation experiment of Griselinea littoralis; and (3) in a long-term nutrient-, temperature-, and light manipulation at Toolik, Alaska, USA. Leaf dry matter content, specific leaf area, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), sugars, starch, and AOX/COX protein concentrations were also measured as explanatory variables. (Leaf Cu and Fe were measured at the Franz Josef chronosequence.) RESULTS: Discrimination values computed using my methods replicated previously reported results over a range of 10 – 31 ‰, with precision generally better than ± 0. 5 ‰, thus demonstrating its validity as tool for measuring respiratory electron partitioning. Foliar respiration declined with site age across the soil chronosequence, increasing with leaf N levels, r² = 0. 8, but electron partitioning declined with increasing N/P, r² = 0. 23. AP activity {{was positively correlated with}} leaf P, Cu, and starch, r² = 0. 71. In younger soils, however, declines in respiration were attributed to declines in cytochrome pathway (CP) activity, whereas across the older sites respiration declined due to a reduction in AOX pathway (AP) activity. The Griselinia nutrient-manipulation experiment partially confirmed these results: AOX protein levels were highest in N-deficient plants rather than in plants deficient in both N and P. AP activity was very low in all leaves, however, possibly due to low illumination. In support of this claim, leaves that had developed in the sun had higher AOX/COX protein ratios than those that had developed in the greenhouse. In Griselinia roots, CP activity declined by more than half in response to nutrient deficiency, whereas AP activity was unchanged. At the Arctic site, only one species changed electron partitioning in response to nutrient addition. Betula nana, the most successful adapter to improved mineral nutrition, doubled leaf CP activity without changing AP activity. Species grown in full sun at that site also had higher AOX/COX protein ratios than those that grew in enclosures. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of how engagement of terminal respiratory oxidases in plants responds to multiple nutrient deficiencies, both in nature and in a controlled environment. I have uncovered some intriguing relationships, including the possible importance of N/P to electron partitioning, as well as a role for Cu. The results also suggest that electron partitioning is sensitive to plant energy balance, as suggested by the low AP activities and low AOX/COX protein ratios in shaded plants. Perhaps most significantly, the AP and CP appeared to act independently of each other, rather than through a concerted “partitioning” process. In addition to their own scientific merit, these results illustrate the value of using the new field-compatible method to conduct ecophysiological investigations of plant respiratory electron partitioning on a much large scale, and under more realistic conditions, than has been previously possible...|$|R
40|$|Study objectives: To {{establish}} {{the stability of}} vincristine (Teva) in original vials with re-piercing over 28 days, and the stability of dilute infusions in polyolefin containers and polypropylene syringes at drug concentrations/storage condition combinations of relevance to ‘standard’ pharmaceutical practice that meet UK Department of Health National Patient Safety Agency guidance. Methods: Original vials of vincristine injection (5 mg/ 5 mL, Teva) were stored under different conditions and subjected to re-piercing at intervals over 28 days. Samples taken at each interval were subjected to a stability-indicating LC assay for vincristine. In separate studies, the stability of vincristine infusions (50 mL) in polyolefin bags (0. 01 and 0. 05 mg/mL) and in polypropylene syringes (0. 5 mg in 20 mL and 2 mg in 20 mL), was determined under refrigerated and room temperature conditions. Results: Vincristine injection (5 mg/ 5 mL) in original vials was chemically stable (> 95 % of initial concentration remaining) when stored at refrigerated or room temperature, with and without light protection, and subjected to six piercings of the vial over 28 days. The very dilute 0. 01 mg/mL vincristine infusions in polyolefin containers exhibited unpredictable chemical stability, although no infusion fell below 90 % of initial concentration remaining over 84 days. The 0. 05 mg/mL infusion in polyolefin containers and the 0. 5 mg/ 20 mL and 2 mg/ 20 mL infusions in polypropylene syringes were all physically and chemically stable over 84 days under both refrigerated and room temperature <b>storage.</b> Conclusion: <b>Vials</b> of vincristine injection (Teva) which are subject to repeat piercing, may be stored for up to 28 days with no loss of chemical potency.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this laboratory {{study was to identify}} and measure manganese (Mn) fractions in chamber-generated welding fumes (WF) and to evaluate and compare the results from a sequential extraction procedure for Mn fractions with that of an acid digestion procedure for measurement of total, elemental Mn. To prepare Mn-containing particulate matter from representative welding processes, a welding system was operated in short circuit gas metal arc welding (GMAW) mode using both stainless steel (SS) and mild carbon steel (MCS) and also with flux cored arc welding (FCAW) and shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) using MCS. Generated WF samples were collected onto polycarbonate filters before homogenization, weighing and <b>storage</b> in scintillation <b>vials.</b> The extraction procedure consisted of four sequential steps to measure various Mn fractions based upon selective solubility: (1) soluble Mn dissolved in 0. 01 M ammonium acetate; (2) Mn (0,II) dissolved in 25 % (v/v) acetic acid; (3) Mn (III,IV) dissolved in 0. 5 % (w/v) hydroxylamine hydrochloride in 25 % (v/v) acetic acid; and (4) insoluble Mn extracted with concentrated hydrochloric and nitric acids. After sample treatment, the four fractions were analyzed for Mn by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). WF from GMAW and FCAW showed similar distributions of Mn species, with the largest concentrations of Mn detected in the Mn (0,II) and insoluble Mn fractions. On the other hand, the majority of the Mn content of SMAW fume was detected as Mn (III,IV). Although the concentration of Mn measured from summation of the four sequential steps was statistically significantly different from that measured from the hot block dissolution method for total Mn, the difference is small enough to be of no practical importance for industrial hygiene air samples, and either method may be used for Mn measurement. The sequential extraction method provides valuable information about the oxidation state of Mn in samples and allows for comparison to results from previous work and from total Mn dissolution methods.

H 577 P SO 2015 Chanxx, 205 pages :illustrationsBackground: The use of {{cosmetic}} {{contact lenses}} (CCL) {{has become increasingly}} popular especially in Asian countries such as Korea, Taiwan,Singapore and China. The public can easily purchase CCL online, at cabinet stores, flea markets, department stores, and accessories stores. CCL not prescribed and dispensed from optometric practices are just commodities to the salespersons who have no proper training in contact lens care and handling. Lack of training {{poses a threat to}} wearers who are not provided with any eye examination, aftercare services, or advice on proper lens usage and care. The quality of these CCL is also an issue as {{there is a lack of}} information on the manufacturer, the pigments used, manufacturing process, and the colour printing process. With huge demand for CCL in the market and lack of regulations of the sale of CCL, there is a need to review the safety of CCL. To date, research on CCL is scarce. This is probably due to the relatively low popularity of CCL, particularly in Caucasian countries. It was not until recent years that CCL regained attention due to increasing popularity in Asian countries and reports of microbial keratitis cases related to CCL. There was therefore a need to investigate the characteristics of CCL, particularly surface pigment CCL, and their implications on safe CCL wear. Objectives: The objectives of this PhD study were to: 1. develop a method to determine the location and permanency of pigments on CCL 2. investigate the effect of surface pigments of CCL on microbial adherence 3. investigate cytotoxic effect of surface pigment of CCL on porcine corneal epithelial cells using the new porcine eye model(PEM) 4. investigate the effect of surface pigments of CCL on protein deposition Methods: Experiment 1 : The permanency of pigments of five brands of CCL was tested using a cotton bud rub-off test. Each lens was removed from its blister pack and placed on the cleaned surface of an electronic scale to allow monitoring of the force applied when each lens was rubbed to ensure consistency of force applied (applied force between 110 230 g) for all lenses. Any pigment coming off the lens surface was determined by examining the tip of the cotton bud for pigment transfer after every rub. The procedures were repeated on both front and back surface. Experiment 2 : Fifteen brands of new CCL (five lenses of each brand) were challenged with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027. Three brands of lenses and their clear counterparts were also challenged with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and Serratia marcescens ATCC 13880. Lenses were incubated in bacterial suspension immediately after they were removed from the blister packs or <b>storage</b> <b>vials.</b> After 24 hours,the lenses were removed aseptically and rinsed gently with phosphate buffered saline to remove loosely attached micro-organisms and the viable organisms adhered to the lenses were enumerated using an automated colony counter after plating. Experiment 3 : In order to test the cytotoxic effects of CCL in an ex vivo model,improvements were needed to the existing porcine eye model. These modifications were required because the current model only allows two porcine eyes set up each time and there was no strict control of the surrounding temperature or humidity. A total of 57 porcine eyes were used and they were mounted on four test PEM with blinking and lacrimation simulation. The nictitating membrane of the porcine eyes was held by a movable arm connecting to a motor to simulate blinking. An infusion wing was set right above the cornea so that Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) could be applied to the superior limbal region regularly to simulate lacrimation. Viability of the corneal epithelial cells was assessed with 0. 4 % trypan blue solutions three hours after the commencement of the experiment. Two controls were set up: control A was to assess cell viability immediately without any treatment and control B was to assess cell viability on PEM without blinking and lacrimation simulation after three hours. Back surface pigment CCL and the clear contact lens clear counterparts were pre-soaked in different multipurpose solutions (MPS) and hydrogen peroxide system for 24 hours. The CCL were then placed on the porcine eyes on PEM with blinking and lacrimation simulation. Cell viability was assessed after three hours of experiment using Annexin V-FITC/ 7 -AAD kit. Experiment 4 : Ten young adults aged 18 - 35 years old were recruited. Subjects were required to wear the contact lenses (two brands of CCL and one clear contact lenses of the same lens material) for eight to ten hours. At the end of a day's wear, the subjects returned to the clinic and the contact lenses were removed and collected for protein quantification. Results: Experiment 1 : Only one brand of CCLs was found to have no pigment coming off after repeated rubs with a wetted cotton bud. The other CCL all had pigment transferred to the cotton bud after two rubs (Range: 1 - 7). Experiment 2 :Surface pigment CCL showed significantly higher amounts of microbial colonization than their clear counterparts for all bacterial species tested (p 0. 402). Experiment 3 : No significant difference was found in the number of dead cells between the four test PEMs in both central (p= 0. 53) and peripheral cornea (p= 0. 19). There were significantly more dead cells (central and periphery) in the test PEMs compared to control A (p 0. 05). The number of early necrotic,late necrotic and apoptotic cells between CCL and clear contact lenses in all tested solutions were also not significantly different (p> 0. 05). Experiment 4 : The results showed no significant differences in protein deposition between sandwich CCL (Median: 583 [Range: 362 - 980]) or surface pigment CCL (Median: 600 [Range: 483 - 892]) and clear contact lens (Median: 639 [Range: 347 - 731]). Conclusions:The rub-off test provided an indirect and simple method to determine the pigment location of CCL. Our study showed that CCL with pigments printed on the surface resulted in significantly higher bacterial adhesion. However,using the improved PEM showed that the cytotoxic effects of leachates from surface pigments CCL were not significantly different compared to those of clear contact lenses after three hours of exposure. Protein deposition on CCL, either sandwiched or surface pigments, after one day of lens wear, was also not different from those on clear contact lenses worn by the same subject.

After treatment, samples were quenched and frozen in quartz vials and characterized by using high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (HF-EPR). For SBA- 15 - and Al 2 O 3 -supported vanadia, V 4 + sites were the most abundant paramagnetic species, whereas Ti 3 + was dominant in TiO 2 -supported V 2 O 5. For the quantification of paramagnetic reduced sites, Mn 2 + was used as reference. The maximum relative numbers of reduced V 4 + or Ti 3 + sites were found to increase in the sequence SBA- 15 (11 [*]% V 4 +/V) <Al 2 O 3 (16 [*]% V 4 +/V) <TiO 2 (21 [*]% Ti 3 +/V) if hydrogen {{was used as a}} reducing agent. Using propane as a reductant, the percentage ratios were found to be SBA- 15 (8 [*]% V 4 +/V), Al 2 O 3 (18 [*]% V 4 +/V), and TiO 2 (27 [*]% Ti 3 +/V). The corresponding V 4 +/V or Ti 3 +/V percentage ratios for samples exposed to ODP were lower, at 0. 08, 9, and 17 [*]%, respectively. The number of paramagnetic non-V 4 + or non-Ti 3 + sites was negligible for Al 2 O 3 and SBA- 15 and in the range of 12 – 37 [*]% for TiO 2 -supported vanadia. The number of reduced sites after oxidation in air and <b>storage</b> in sealed <b>vials</b> is negligible, which indicates that all reduced sites can generally be reoxidized. After reaction in an oxygen-lean ODP atmosphere, a structureless HF-EPR pattern was observed for SBA- 15 -supported vanadia, which is tentatively attributed to the formation of two-dimensional polymeric structures of vanadia. For Al 2 O 3 -supported vanadia, this loss of spectral resolution was less pronounced, which indicates a more defined environment of V 4 + sites. The results are discussed in terms of a two-parameter model, rationalizing the dual influences of reducibility and local structure of redox-active sites on the ODP reaction...|$|R
