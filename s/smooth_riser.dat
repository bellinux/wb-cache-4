40|$|In {{order to}} achieve high solids {{circulation}} rate(Gs),an idea of coupling a moving bed to the bottom section of the riser of a circulating fluidized bed(CFB) was proposed and tested. The results from the preliminary study demonstrated that the solids circulation rate in the new-structure bed approached 370 kg·m- 2 ·s- 1 at superficial gas velocities around 10. 5 m·s- 1 for sand particles with an average Sauter mean size of 378 μm. This study was devoted to further justifying {{the effects of the}} coupled moving bed by performing comparative studies in two CFBs with conventional configurations. It was shown that the pressure at the riser bottom and the realized solid circulation rate were only about 15 kPa and 230 kg·m- 2 ·s- 1 in the two conventionally configured CFBs,obviously lower than 25 kPa and 370 kg·m- 2 ·s- 1 in the moving bed coupled CFB. These verified that the coupled moving bed increased the force driving particles form the particle recycling side into the riser. The study further tested the effect of a few specially designed riser exit configurations,revealing that a <b>smooth</b> <b>riser</b> exit could facilitate solids circulation to increase the solids circulation rate...|$|E
50|$|The steps {{themselves}} are solid, one piece, die-cast aluminum or steel. Yellow demarcation lines are sometimes added {{to indicate their}} edges. In most escalator models manufactured after 1950, both the riser and the tread of each step is cleated (given a ribbed appearance) with comb-like protrusions that mesh with the comb plates {{on the top and}} bottom platforms and the succeeding steps in the chain. Seeberger escalators featured flat treads and smooth risers; other escalator models have cleated treads and <b>smooth</b> <b>risers.</b> The steps are linked by a continuous metal chain that forms a closed loop. The front and back edges of the steps each have two wheels, the rear of which are set further apart and fit into the trailer-wheel track while the front set have narrower axles and fit the step-wheel track.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{focus of}} this work is {{a study of the}} {{adsorption}} of noble gases on individual, suspended, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). The surface of a SWNT is a cylindrical cousin of graphite, but the binding energy is smaller and the cylindrical geometry and lack of grain boundaries could be expected to lead to substantially different behavior. The coverage (areal density) on a nanotube can be measured with high precision from the mechanical resonance frequency shifts, yielding isotherms as a function of gas pressure analogous to volumetric isotherms on bulk substrates. The electrical conductance of the nanotubes can also be measured {{at the same time and}} the effects of the adsorbates on the conductance thereby investigated. We found that adsorbed noble gases form monolayers on SWNTs, analogous to those on conventional 2 -dimensional (2 D) substrates, with a variety of 2 D phases as a result of atom-atom interactions. Based on a combination of the coverage and conductance isotherms, the behavior of the adsorbates on SWNTs was established, including the 2 D phases, 2 D critical and triple-point temperatures, binding energies, isosteric heats, and latent heats. The majority of measurements were on Ar and Kr, fewer on 4 He and Xe. The binding energy of the noble gases on a SWNT was found to be lower than on graphite, as anticipated. For example, the binding energy for Ar on one device was about 725 K ± 50 K, about 30 % lower than graphite. The lower binding energy allows isotherm measurements at lower temperatures compared because the required pressure are higher. In all cases we found that only a single atomic layer is formed before reaching the saturated vapor pressure of the adsorbate. Remarkably, although the binding energies of Ar were consistent between multiple SWNTs, the adsorbates on different devices did not behave in the same way. The device can be classified into two classes. Those in Class I show sharp first-order transitions between 2 D phases, very similar to those on graphite, and the maximum monolayer coverage on SWNTs is consistent with that on graphite taking into account the radius of nanotube. Large and sharp risers at constant pressures in the coverage or conductance isotherms indicate the 2 D liquid-vapor or commensurate solid-vapor conversion. Small and <b>smoother</b> <b>risers</b> following the large ones in the isotherms indicate the 2 D incommensurate solid-liquid phase transitions. In contrast, devices in Class II do not show clear phase transitions, have non-vertical isotherms in regions where first-order jumps would be expected, and the monolayers seem to be not complete when the saturated vapor pressure is reached. The difference in isosteric heat between devices of the two classes within the region where the first-order transition is expected, may be due to the 2 D L-V latent heat. The existence of the two different classes of behavior remains puzzling. It appears that in class II nanotubes the effects of atom-atom attractive interactions are suppressed, due possibly either to geometrical effects or the different electrical properties of different nanotube species...|$|R
