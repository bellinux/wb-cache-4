5|$|The {{compilation}} was one {{of several}} ideas Rare considered to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Inspired by fans, upcoming Xbox One backward compatibility features, and a desire to link Rare's past and future, the company <b>sorted</b> <b>through</b> 120 games to choose titles that best represented its oeuvre. It prioritized games with characters and environments original to the company. Rare incorporated six hardware emulators in the package, and worked with its parent company, Microsoft, to use its unannounced Xbox 360 emulation. Rare Replay released worldwide as an Xbox One exclusive on August 4, 2015.|$|E
25|$|When {{his father}} died in 1808, Coles {{received}} 12 slaves and a 782-acre plantation on the Rockfish River in Nelson County, Virginia, subject to a mortgage. After John Coles' estate was settled on Christmas Eve, 1808, Edward Coles revealed his emancipation plans to his family, to great consternation. As he <b>sorted</b> <b>through</b> the challenges posed by family resistance and Virginia law (which since 1806 required freed slaves to leave the state within a year, and had also increased restrictions on already free blacks), Coles abandoned his earliest plan to free his slaves in Virginia. He went to Kentucky {{in the summer of}} 1809 to investigate a land claim of his uncle Travis Tucker, but came home without plans to move to that new state (which allowed slavery).|$|E
25|$|Law {{enforcement}} {{missed an}} opportunity to catch Franklin because his DNA was never collected. In 2003, {{he was convicted of}} a felony and was serving three years of supervised probation. In 2004, voters passed Proposition 69, which requires that DNA must be collected from all felons and everyone arrested on some specified charges. It also requires the expansion of the DNA database. Authorities collected and <b>sorted</b> <b>through</b> thousands of DNA samples. While he was on probation, Franklin's DNA was supposed to be entered in the DNA database. In July 2005, Franklin was on unsupervised probation, but his DNA was not entered into the system. Probation officers did not collect DNA samples from people who were on unsupervised probation between November 2004 and August 2005. During that period, the probation department did not have the resources to collect samples. Officers did not collect samples until August 2005.|$|E

Unterecker writes that Yeats {{made an effort to}} keep the correspondence private: [...] "Shortly before his death he methodically destroyed a large group of letters to Olivia Shakespear. These, returned to him after her death... Yeats wanted no one to read".|$|E
500|$|Fiala {{had been}} {{referred}} to the Gateway Foundation {{by the president of}} a local catering company, and the foundation later asked him to run the Terrace View. A foundation spokesperson said that the [...] "Gateway Foundation board <b>sorted</b> <b>through</b> a lot of different candidates, and they were thrilled to find one who was perfect." [...] Fiala had wanted to open the Terrace View before the 2009 All-Star Game, but was forced to delay in order to settle contracts and have a liquor license approved. The establishment was originally scheduled to open on July 1, the same day as Citygarden's opening and two weeks before the game.|$|E
500|$|Rare {{began work}} on Rare Replay in 2014 as a 30th anniversary celebration. The company wanted to do {{something}} unique for what they considered a rare milestone in the industry. Rare was also influenced by community requests to bring their classics to Xbox One, and by the Microsoft backward-compatibility team's progress on the feature. The compilation was one of several celebration ideas, but once it was chosen, the [...] "30 years" [...] theme led to the 30 game limit and [...] price point. As reflective of the company's character and celebratory theme, Rare chose a papercraft art style and theatrical stage setting for the compilation. Rare Replay became part of Rare's plan to simultaneously celebrate its past and introduce its future with a logo redesign, new website, and announcement of their upcoming game, Sea of Thieves. To select the final 30 games, Rare <b>sorted</b> <b>through</b> 120 games in their catalog. They rated each title for fitness and prioritized those that featured characters and environments original to the company, choosing to exclude those based on licensed intellectual properties. Secondarily, Rare considered whether licenses were available and whether a title remained fun and playable by modern standards. They wanted a wide and representative sample of [...] "popular games that would hit that nostalgic beat that everyone likes". Rare chose the Nintendo 64 Conker's Bad Fur Day over the Xbox version (Conker: Live & Reloaded) because they felt the latter had strayed too far from the original. While Rare Replay designers made the final call, other Rare employees and veterans gave input and recollected old game development stories.|$|E
