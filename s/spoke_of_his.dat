5|$|After {{a five-year}} exile from {{international}} football, interim manager Noel King recalled Reid to the Irish squad for the qualifiers against Germany and Kazakhstan. Reid <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> gratitude for King for recalling {{him to the}} Ireland squad fearing that the opportunity would not come along again to play for his country. On 15 October 2013, Reid made his return in an Irish jersey against Kazakhstan playing 75 mins before being replaced by Aiden McGeady in a 3-1 win in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|Edmund's fictitious {{continental}} origins {{were later}} expanded into legends which <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> parentage, his birth at Nuremberg, his adoption by Offa of Mercia, his nomination as {{successor to the}} king and his landing at Hunstanton on the North Norfolk coast to claim his kingdom. Other accounts state {{that his father was}} the king he succeeded, Æthelweard of East Anglia, who died in 854, apparently when Edmund was a boy of fourteen.|$|E

The Times of India reported that Kapoor met Rajput through the religious group Radha Soami Satsang Beas. The couple married at a private ceremony in Gurgaon on 7 July 2015, and Rajput gave birth to their daughter, Misha, on 26 August 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{severely limited}} {{his ability to}} play in away matches in European competitions and to travel with the national team. In some cases, he would travel overland by car or train, but the logistics of some matches were such {{that he would not}} travel at all. In the build-up to Arsenal's Champions League match against Lyon in February 2001, Wenger <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> concerns for Bergkamp travelling by train and car, because of the exertions involved.|$|E
5|$|Fry <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{desire to}} re-sign Boucaud, and after Reading {{released}} him on 10 May 2004, he re-signed for Peterborough on a two-year contract on 14 May. He made 24 appearances and scored one goal during 2004–05. Boucaud joined Conference National club Aldershot Town on a three-month loan on 16 September 2005. He returned to Peterborough after being recalled from his loan on 15 December 2005, which {{he finished with}} 13 appearances. Following {{his return to the}} club he was challenged by manager Mark Wright to fight for his place in the team. After failing to figure in Wright's and subsequently Steve Bleasdale's plans, Boucaud was released by Peterborough on 9 May 2006 after his contract was allowed to expire.|$|E

5|$|New signing Glenn Hysén {{made his}} {{competitive}} debut for Liverpool and Ian Rush started ahead of fellow striker John Aldridge. For Arsenal, Gus Caesar replaced Steve Bould {{in the starting}} team. The only goal of the match came {{in the first half}} – a long ball from Barry Venison floated around the Arsenal defence and found Peter Beardsley in the penalty area to score. Afterwards Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> delight at his team's performance and the Arsenal manager George Graham was complimentary of his opponents.|$|E
5|$|Burnham {{would not}} smoke and seldom drank alcohol, fearing these habits would injure the acuteness of {{his sense of}} smell. He found ways to train himself in mental patience, took power naps instead of indulging in periods of long sleep, and drank very little liquid. He trained himself to accept these abstinences in order to endure the most appalling fatigues, hunger, thirst, and wounds, so that when {{scouting}} or traveling {{where there was no}} water, he might still be able to exist. On more than one occasion he survived in environments where others would have died, or were in fact dying, of exhaustion. He was quiet-mannered and courteous, according to contemporaries. Their reports describe a man who was neither shy nor self-conscious, who was extremely modest, and who seldom <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> many adventures.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{attended}} Rugby School. Unhappy {{during his}} school years, {{he made no}} lasting friendships there. Although he did reasonably well in his classes, he was not outstanding academically or athletically, and his father withdrew him from the school four months short of his eighteenth birthday. In later years, as Chamberlain rose to the heights of British politics, he seldom visited the school, did not enrol his own son, and rarely <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time there. Joseph Chamberlain then sent Neville to Mason College (which later developed into the University of Birmingham), which both emphasised the politician's connection to Birmingham and catered to the interest in science which Neville had shown at Rugby. Neville Chamberlain studied metallurgy and engineering for two years, but {{had little interest in}} the subjects. In 1889 his father apprenticed him to a firm of accountants. Within six months, he became a salaried employee.|$|E
5000|$|However, Richard always <b>spoke</b> highly <b>of</b> <b>his</b> parents.

[...] Writer Jessamyn West, a cousin of the Nixons, was in Frank's Sunday school class for some time.

5|$|The {{paper was}} {{launched}} {{with an initial}} print-run of 60,000, and was edited by a skeleton staff during the trial run, with plans to employ more journalists if it became a permanent publication. Initial contributors included Sunday Herald journalists Jamie Maxwell and Peter Geoghegan, as well as freelance reporter Sarah Cooper. During the initial week of publication, Walker <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> belief that The National would continue beyond the trial period, but said the decision was {{in the hands of}} its publishers. Following healthy sales in the first few days, Newsquest executives decided on 27 November to continue printing the newspaper, and to allocate it additional resources. On the same day, Neil Mackay, The Nationals news editor, confirmed that the paper would be published on a permanent basis. Publication then continued on weekdays until the introduction of a Saturday edition in May 2015.|$|E
5|$|After he was rammed by his {{teammate}} Brian Vickers in the UAW-Ford 500, Johnson said the expectations {{for him to}} succeed at Lowe's Motor Speedway were high and hoped the track's surface would be more predictable. Martin {{said he was in}} the best position that he had been in for several years to win the championship, and <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> waning interest in looking at race results. Having secured one top-ten finish in the season's first four Chase for the Nextel Cup races, Earnhardt stated he need to secure a top-five finishing position, and was determined to get his team more involved in the championship battle. Gordon had driven well at the circuit, but without finishing. His team brought the car he drove to victory in the season's 18th race at Chicagoland Speedway. Gordon felt it would help him at intermediate tracks and get him back into championship contention. Although he had a poor start in the chase, Kahne rectified this by finishing second at Talladega Superspeedway. He believed the momentum would be carried into Charlotte and stated he would push hard to win races.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{took the}} party into the 2015 United Kingdom general election, which saw a {{majority}} {{win for the}} Conservatives, and Labour's worst-ever election result in Scotland. There was a landslide shift towards the SNP, which took 56 of the 59 Scottish seats at Westminster, while Labour lost 40 of the 41 Westminster seats it was defending. Notable losses included Murphy's constituency of East Renfrewshire and Brown's former constituency of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, previously Labour's safest seat in Scotland. Other high-profile figures such as Sarwar, Clark, Curran, Ian Davidson, and Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander also lost their seats. Following his defeat, Murphy <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> intention to stand for a Holyrood seat in 2016. However, the result prompted Labour figures {{and those in the}} trade union movement to question the future of his leadership. Ian Davidson suggested that {{it would be difficult for}} Murphy to remain as Scottish Labour leader without a parliamentary seat and in the wake of such a heavy defeat. Rafferty, and Kevin Lindsay of ASLEF, called for his resignation, while Findlay, and Labour's local government spokesman Alex Rowley, expressed their concerns about the party's future under Murphy's leadership and resigned from his shadow cabinet.|$|E

5|$|Takanohana finally {{returned}} to the ring in September 2002, after the Sumo Association declared he must compete or retire. He finished behind Musashimaru on 12–3, the 16th time {{he had been a}} tournament runner-up. Considering how long he had been away, it was seen as an impressive comeback. However, he sat out the next tournament with a recurrence of the knee injury. He made another comeback in January 2003, making a late decision to compete. A shoulder injury caused him to miss two days, and after suffering successive losses to Dejima and Aminishiki he announced his retirement. He said he had no regrets and was thankful to have achieved so much in sumo. His father <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> relief at the decision, after seeing his son battle through so many injuries. Takanohana's record of 22 tournament championships was the fourth best in sumo history, behind only Taihō, Chiyonofuji and Kitanoumi at the time. Junichiro Koizumi, the Prime Minister, was among those paying tribute. His retirement left no Japanese born wrestlers at the yokozuna rank and was widely regarded as being the end of an era.|$|E
