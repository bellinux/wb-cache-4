Although some were well-treated, others were subjected to various forms of abuse, including sexual abuse. Some were converted to Islam. A number of soldiers who kidnapped these children still hold senior positions within the Indonesian military.|$|E

5|$|Politically, Robinson opposed both secession and abolition. Though he had Union sympathies, he was {{considered}} a moderate, opposing both fugitive slave laws and the enlistment of black <b>soldiers.</b> <b>As</b> a state senator, he supported the Crittenden Compromise and opposed the Civil War. As governor, he drew criticism from the administration of President Abraham Lincoln for opposing the Emancipation Proclamation.|$|E

5|$|Acarya Ananda Jha, {{the author}} of the Chinnamasta Tattva, prescribes her worship by <b>soldiers</b> <b>as</b> she embodies {{self-control}} of lust, heroic self-sacrifice for the benefit of others, and fearlessness in the face of death. In a collective prayer to the Mahavidyas in the Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana, the devotee prays to emulate Chhinnamasta in her generosity to others. Other goals common to worship of all Mahavidyas are: poetic speech, well-being, control of one's foes, removal of obstacles, ability to sway kings, ability to attract others, conquest over other kings, and, finally, moksha (salvation).|$|E
5|$|Andrew Báthory {{lost his}} throne {{and his life}} {{fighting}} against Michael the Brave and his Székely allies in autumn. Michael the Brave administered Transylvania as RudolphII's governor, but his rule was unpopular among the noblemen, especially because of the pillaging raids made by his unpaid <b>soldiers.</b> <b>As</b> early as 9February 1600 Sigismund {{announced that he was}} ready to return to Transylvania. Moses Székely, a commander-in-chief during Michael the Brave's campaign against Moldavia in May, deserted Michael and came to Poland to meet Sigismund.|$|E

5|$|Carpentier {{reduces the}} {{individuality}} of the characters, enhancing {{the notion of}} humanity, keeping {{in line with the}} theme of history as a repetition of patterns regardless of who is in power. The simultaneous presence of fact and fiction and the cycle of reversal of fortunes presents characters as functional variants of each other. Through frequent use of metonymy, whereby a part replaces a whole, for example, referring to <b>soldiers</b> <b>as</b> uniformes (uniforms), Carpentier shifts the focus from individuals to the collective.|$|E
5|$|Diego López de Salcedo sailed from Santo Domingo {{with two}} ships, {{carrying}} {{a large number}} of <b>soldiers,</b> <b>as</b> well as provisions and clothing he intended to sell to the colonists. Contrary winds delayed López de Salcedo off Jamaica for a month; he eventually disembarked in Trujillo on 26 October 1526, after a lengthy standoff with Saavedra that almost came to violence. At last Saavedra was convinced that López de Salcedo had been authorised directly by the crown, and allowed him to come ashore.|$|E

5|$|Leclerc heeded {{the advice}} {{he was given}} by United States General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to bring as many <b>soldiers</b> <b>as</b> possible. He broke the Vietminh {{blockade}} around Saigon, then drove through the Mekong delta and up into the highlands. This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French colonialism, which he perceived to be in decline. Ho's first priority was {{getting rid of the}} Chinese, and for this he needed French help. Leclerc quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Of humble origin, {{he became}} Theodore's {{companion}} in childhood and {{was raised to}} high state office upon the latter's assumption of power. This caused great resentment from the aristocracy, which had monopolized high offices and opposed Theodore's policies. Shortly before Theodore's death in 1258, he was appointed regent of Theodore's under-age son John IV Laskaris (r. 1258–1261). He was assassinated {{only a few days}} later by <b>soldiers,</b> <b>as</b> the result of a conspiracy led by the nobles under the soon-to-be emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282).|$|E
5|$|On 8–9 July 1960, the {{soldiers}} were invited to appoint black officers, and 'command of the army passed securely {{into the hands of}} former sergeants,' as {{the soldiers}} in general chose the most-educated and highest-ranked Congolese army <b>soldiers</b> <b>as</b> their new officers. Most of the Belgian officers were retained as advisors to the new Congolese hierarchy, and calm returned to the two main garrisons at Leopoldville and Thysville. The Force Publique was renamed the Armée nationale congolaise (ANC), or Congolese National Armed Forces. However, in Katanga Belgian officers resisted the Africanisation of the army.|$|E

Still, his {{experiences}} in Vietnam embittered him to U.S. foreign policy. Upon returning to the United States, he spoke of a wariness of future conflicts to author C. D. B. Bryan in 1971: He related these experiences under the assumed name of Lieutenant Colonel Byron Schindler.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Massachusetts reached Washington D.C. on April 19, 1861, {{the first}} unit {{to arrive in}} {{response}} to Lincoln's call for troops. A large, cheering crowd welcomed them at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Station which once stood north of the Capitol. Among the crowd was Clara Barton who became a famed nurse during the Civil War. At the time a clerk in the U.S. Patent Office, Barton gained her first experience in caring for wounded <b>soldiers</b> <b>as</b> she tended to injured men of the 6th Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The fort was {{initially}} commanded by Captain James Crane, with a garrison of ten men, including his second in command, a porter, six gunners and two <b>soldiers.</b> <b>As</b> time went on, {{not all of}} the gunners worked full-time at the fort, some living and working in the town itself. It is uncertain how many artillery pieces the blockhouse {{was initially}} equipped with, although it is known that the five blockhouses along the Thames had 108 brass and iron guns in total between them in 1540.|$|E

5|$|The {{historical}} {{representation of}} Charlie Company's actions, led by its commander, Captain Ralph E. Goranson, was well maintained {{in the opening}} sequence. The sequence and details of the events {{are very close to}} the historical record, including the sea sickness experienced by many of the <b>soldiers</b> <b>as</b> the landing craft moved toward the shoreline, significant casualties among the men as they disembarked from the boats, and difficulty linking up with adjacent units on the shore.|$|E
5|$|With the 1860 {{election}} of Abraham Lincoln, {{the first president}} from the largely anti-slavery Republican Party, conventions in thirteen slave states ultimately declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America, while the federal government maintained that secession was illegal. The ensuing war was at first for Union, then after 1863 as casualties mounted and Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation, a second war aim became abolition of slavery. The war remains the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting {{in the deaths of}} approximately 618,000 <b>soldiers</b> <b>as</b> well as many civilians.|$|E
5|$|Yvonne Navarro co-wrote a novelization {{based on}} the {{original}} screenplay with Dennis Feldman. The book gives several in-depth details about the characters not seen in the film, such as Sil's ability to visualize odors and determine harmful substances from edible items by the color. Gas appears black, food appears pink, and an unhealthy potential mate appears to give off green fumes. Other character details include Preston's background in tracking down AWOL <b>soldiers</b> <b>as</b> well as the process of decoding the alien signal. Although no clues are given as to its origin, it is mentioned that the message was somehow routed through several black holes to mask its point of origin.|$|E

Up until 1918 it was Gemeine (Ordinary <b>soldier)</b> <b>as</b> well as unit-specific distinctions such as Musketier (musketeer), Infanterist (infantryman), Kürassier (cuirassier), Jäger (light-infantryman otherwise ranger), Füsilier (fusilier) etc., until 1945 Soldat (soldier) and unit-specific distinctions such as Schütze (rifleman), Grenadier (grenadier) etc. The navy {{equivalent of}} the OR-1 rank is known as Matrose (sailor or seaman), and the German Air Force equivalent is Flieger (aviator or airman) which is also used by army aviators.|$|R
