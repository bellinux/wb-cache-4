5|$|During Sophia's lifetime, {{there were}} various rumours about her alleged incestuous {{relationship}} with her brother, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, who later became the King of Hanover. The Prince Regent supposedly warned his sisters not to be alone in the <b>same</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> the Duke, and Cumberland was deeply unpopular with the British people. It is unclear whether there was truth to these rumours or whether they were circulated by the Duke's numerous political enemies.|$|E
5|$|The House of Rohan {{owned the}} palace until the French Revolution, {{when it was}} confiscated, {{declared}} bien national ("state owned"), and finally auctioned off on 8August 1791. Bought by the municipality, it became the new town hall (hôtel deville) the same year, succeeding the Neubau. Much of the furniture {{and many of the}} works of art in the Palais were sold, and in 1793 the eight life-sized mural portraits of prince-bishops decorating the Salle des évêques (Bishops' Hall) were destroyed. They were replaced in 1796 by allegories of civic virtues painted by Joseph Melling. Only the portrait of Armand Gaston, the builder of the palace, was later restored to its original place with a 1982 replica of Hyacinthe Rigaud's lost painting. Melling also replaced the overdoor portraits of kings of France, decorating the <b>same</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> paintings of vases.|$|E

Although the tumors became obvious only in animals {{about a year}} old and older, early stage changes were histologically evident in glands from younger, clinically normal voles. The tumors ranged in type from poorly differentiated adenoma to adenocarcinoma, with invasion of adjacent tissues and characteristic deformation of the zygomata. Electron micrographs disclosed viral particles in the cytoplasm of glands from clinically normal animals {{as well as in}} glands showing malignant changes.

25|$|The {{general layout}} of the House was largely {{untouched}} from the previous non-celebrity series. The living room and bedroom had no noticeable changes. There were several single beds in the <b>same</b> <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> one double bed, meaning that two housemates (Leo and Donny) had to share. The bathroom is much smaller than previous versions and the toilet and shower were no longer fitted with cameras. The dining room table was moved inside, and the kitchen fully equipped with modern conveniences. Outside the garden was a three-jet hot tub with a farmyard seating area. The bridge to Nowhere was still present, leading to a sitting area with heated seats and the topiary man. A workout area was situated just off the kitchen area. Inside the House {{there was also a}} fax machine built into the wall. On day 24 this was used to post viewers' questions to the housemates. Meanwhile, the Diary Room was identical to the previous summer's Big Brother, with an oversized gold chair and padded walls, the only change being the addition of yellow lights facing the walls.|$|E

500|$|In a 2005, {{interview}} with About.com, Burton {{spoke about the}} differences between directing [...] Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: [...] "The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the <b>same</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{remarked that}} Neighborhoods is [...] "a {{different}} beast {{than any of}} the cheerfully snotty early Blink-182 albums, as the band picks up the gloomy thread left hanging on its eponymous 2003 album ... yet it's far better to hear Blink-182 grapple with adolescent angst via the perspective of middle age than vainly attempting to re-create their youth. Perhaps Blink could stand to sharpen their words but it's better that they concentrated on their music, creating a fairly ridiculous yet mildly compelling prog-punk spin on the suburbs here." [...] Tom Goodwyn of NME remarked that it finds the band [...] "completely at ease with its past and confident enough to acknowledge their early work, with nods on the album to moments from their whole back catalogue." [...] British rock magazine Kerrang awarded Neighborhoods a [...] "good" [...] three out of five score in their review. Critic Mark Sutherland noted that while [...] "the finished product is inevitably disjointed, Blink emerge as a surprisingly serious rock proposition." [...] He went on to add that, [...] "While it occasionally sounds like Mark, Tom, and Travis are playing three different songs at once ('Kaleidoscope', 'After Midnight'), the band are still capable of producing genuine moments of magnificence." [...] Scott Heisel of Alternative Press attributed the album's flaws to the lack of an outside producer and the fact that only a few tracks were written and recorded as a group: [...] "Blink-182's members are still capable of writing good songs, but without a strong outside influence (i.e., a producer) and no real desire or effort to consistently work in the <b>same</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> one another, the amount of truly transcendent, classic material is minimal. Ultimately, Neighborhoods is a slightly awkward entry in the band's catalog that shows as much potential as it does flaws." ...|$|E

50|$|HIV/AIDS stigma is {{widespread}} in South Africa: a 2002 national survey revealed that 26% of respondents {{were unwilling to}} share a meal with a person living with AIDS, 18% were unwilling {{to sleep in the}} <b>same</b> <b>room</b> as <b>with</b> someone with AIDS, and 6% were unwilling to talk to a person with AIDS. AIDS-related stigma is most severe among township residents in South Africa because they lack access to reliable information about the disease. Many South Africans in townships wrongly believe that HIV is transmitted through proximity to HIV-positive individuals, which leads them to claim that people with AIDS should be socially ostracized.|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} rate of viral transmission among naive specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats living {{in close contact with}} feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) -infected cats. Twenty SPF cats were housed in the <b>same</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>with</b> experimentally FIV-infected seropositive and virus culture-positive cats for 2 to 4 years and were monitored for the presence of FIV nucleic acids and antibodies. Only 1 of the 20 cats became seropositive and virus culture positive and developed signs of disease. Genomic DNA from bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 10 of 19 healthy-appearing seronegative cats became positive for FIV DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. Twenty-eight SPF cats housed as groups in separate quarters and never exposed to FIV-infected cats were uniformly negative for FIV DNA. FIV RNA transcripts were detected in concanavalin A-stimulated PBMC cultures from 4 of 10 FIV DNA-positive, seronegative cats by in situ hybridization. PBMC from three of four naive SPF cats acquired FIV nucleic acids after the cats were transfused with blood and bone marrow from FIV genome-positive, seronegative donors. Three of five FIV-seronegative cats housed for years with naturally FIV-infected cats in a private household were also found to harbor FIV DNA, indicating that the same phenomenon occurred in the field. These findings demonstrate that cats living in close contact with FIV-infected seropositive cats can acquire FIV nucleic acids without developing detectable levels of serum antibodies or disease...|$|R
