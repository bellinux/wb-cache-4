2500|$|... {{essentially}} {{says that}} she must be paid to have sexâ€”what does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She wants {{to be paid to}} have sex. She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex." ...|$|E
60|$|THE BISHOP. Mrs Collins has {{something}} to say to me that <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to hear.|$|E
6000|$|LORD WINDERMERE. Margaret, {{you could}} save this woman. She {{wants to get}} back into society, and <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to help her. [Crossing to her.] ...|$|E
60|$|I knew that's what <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> here for, Anne, to be {{a witness}} to my pig-headed obstinacy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to help her," [...] said Dick bitterly. Then he {{continued}} suddenly: [...] "Have you {{anything to do}} just now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{much does}} <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to have?" [...] I asked, laughing. [...] "She ought {{to fix the}} sum, so that I may stay till it's made up." ...|$|R
60|$|Black her eye for love's sake, if you will; {{but it is}} all-to-the-good {{business}} to do a thing when <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to do it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lady Kelsey {{has offered}} to pay his {{expenses}} at the 'Varsity,' answered Dick, 'and <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to go and stay with her for the present.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Devine {{took the}} letter. [...] "I fancy <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to go," [...] she said. [...] "She {{mentions}} {{that she has}} asked you several times already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Aunt Ermine {{said you}} were coming, and that I might meet you, but that I must let you come in alone, for {{she had not seen}} you so long, that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> all to herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'F you'd done's <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> should, <b>she</b> might 'a' been at some {{pleasant}} {{place in}} the country--the mount'ns, or somewhere 't she'd been ov'r her cough by this time. But no! You was too nasty proud for that, Lemuel Barker!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was nothing}} said {{about what you}} were to do with it. Jack said they didn't know what was in it, and hadn't looked into it, seeing that it was your property. It seems a rather queer proceeding--but you're always getting mixed up in queer proceedings, Anne. As for what is in it, {{the easiest way to}} find out, I reckon, is to open it and see. The key is tied to it. Jack said Miss Emily said <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to have it because she loved you and saw her lost youth in you. I guess she was a bit delirious at the last and wandered a good deal. <b>She</b> said <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> 'to {{understand}} her.' [...] " ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come in, mamma; here's the housemaid been {{bullying}} Essie, and <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to help her. These two can {{go round}} the park by themselves, can't they ?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{was writing}} {{to me and}} she put this under cover. I know what it contains. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> {{to go to her}} at Cheltenham for a month." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To the westward," [...] {{explained}} Almayer, {{under his}} breath. [...] "She remembers everything. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> {{to build a}} house of cards. You did, last time you were here." ...|$|E
6000|$|Edward {{shook his}} head. [...] "I was merely envying Miss Drewitt her {{possession}} of you," [...] he said, carelessly, [...] "and I {{was just about}} to remark that I wished you were my uncle too, when she came indoors. I suppose <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to hear it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, this evening, say; and, by the way, couldn't {{you come}} up and see Lillie a little while this morning? She sent her love to you, {{and said she was}} so hurried with packing, and all that, that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to excuse her not calling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Miss Mary Jane <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to do that. She says, 'Tell {{them to give}} Uncle Harvey and William my {{love and}} a kiss, and say I've run over the river to see Mr.'--Mr.--what IS {{the name of that}} rich family your uncle Peter used to think so much of?--I mean the one that--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{thinks it}} will make a {{difference}} with you if you sometimes see her. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> so much to stay that she is willing to make that concession." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "dear ov {{you come}} back car is ill <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> be quick be quick don't say I writ this miss min is gone I hate books I like you zo." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{said you}} would have these delusions, but must pay no {{attention}} to them. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to particularly remember that there are no such things as hunger and thirst and pain.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{restrained}} the words: [...] "Of course it's old {{to a kid}} like you!" [...] And, instead, {{he looked}} at her. Was she exactly a kid? She seemed quite tall (for a girl) and not very thin, {{and there was something}} frank and soft about her face, and as if <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to be nice to her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A {{little less}} of the double forte, old man,' he said. 'Miss Weaver has been kicking about the noise on the side. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> thrown out, but I said you were my mascot, and I would die sooner than part with you. But I should go easy on the chest-notes, I think, all the same.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Acton's {{a mighty}} smart woman, but she plays some fool tricks," [...] he commented. [...] "Where's the blame use in taking a {{boatload}} of folks after trout when {{none of them}} but the boss knows how to fish?" [...] Then he chuckled. [...] "You'd have gone with the rest this morning if <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to. Guess the gig would have carried another one quite nicely." ...|$|R
60|$|No; emphatically no. If {{she wants}} Tommy she can stay on; {{but she must}} give up the letters. If <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> she may go; but she must give up the letters.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{said you}} would have these delusions, but must pay no {{attention}} to them. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to particularly remember that there are no such things as hunger and thirst and pain.'' ...|$|E
6000|$|Klaus {{looked up}} quickly. [...] "You {{can see what}} she's trying to say. She thinks I'm the Second Variety. Don't you see, Major? Now <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to believe I killed him on purpose. That I'm--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Greatson," [...] she said, [...] "do {{you know}} what I should <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to do if I were Isobel--what I am quite sure that <b>she</b> must <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to do now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, but let Tilly undress you. Let Tilly undress you, {{who loves}} you, don't be wilful to-night. Mother's poorly, <b>she</b> doesn't <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to cry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want {{to offend}} anybody," [...] he said, [...] "but my wife's obstinacy is enough to try the {{patience}} of a saint. I have told her this is merely a formal document--and what more can <b>she</b> <b>want?</b> <b>You</b> may say what you please, {{but it is no}} part of a woman's duty to set her husband at defiance. Once more, Lady Glyde, and for the last time, will you sign or will you not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good morning," [...] he said absently. [...] "I {{have just}} called {{on my way}} to school with a message from Miss Millar. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> all to come up and have Christmas dinner with her tomorrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|The boy {{answered}} with the disgust a sister's company manners always rouse in a brother. [...] "Motha wants you. Says she's wo'ked down, and <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> {{to come and}} help." [...] Then he went his way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{should you}} wish me to {{interfere}} with you?" [...] I asked. [...] "I wouldn't keep out of it if she wanted {{me as much as}} <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you.</b> That, by your own admission, is exactly what she doesn't." ...|$|E
60|$|BILLY. Never {{mind what}} Captain Kitt says. He <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> {{to stay and}} be company for your sister. He doesn't <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to marry me because he knows <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> to keep <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Marse Tom, if {{you would}} only be a little patient, and not fly off the handle at the least little thing. Why, <b>she</b> only <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to speak to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's poorly, my lamb, she's poorly to-night, but she'll {{be better}} by mornin'. Oh, don't cry, don't cry, love, <b>she</b> doesn't <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to cry, {{precious}} little heart, no, she doesn't." ...|$|R
