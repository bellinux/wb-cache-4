40|$|Abstract â€” In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{proactive}} scheme, burst cloning, to reduce data loss due to burst contention in optical burst-switched (OBS) networks. The {{idea is to}} replicate a burst and <b>send</b> <b>duplicated</b> copies of the burst through the network simultaneously. If the original burst is lost, the cloned burst may {{still be able to}} reach the destination. Primary design issues in burst cloning are to select the optimal nodes at which to do cloning and to prevent cloned bursts from contending for resources with original bursts. An analytical model is developed to evaluate the proposed scheme. The model is verified through extensive simulations. We observe that burst cloning could significantly reduce data loss in OBS networks. I...|$|E

30|$|Avoiding {{unnecessary}} {{requests for}} fast retransmission: On route restoration, the destination can notify the source about the lost packets. In response, the source simply retransmits the lost packets. The packets buffered {{along the path}} from the source to the PN may arrive at their destination earlier than the retransmitted packets, but the destination continues to <b>send</b> <b>duplicate</b> ACK until the expected packets arrive at the destination (via the fast retransmit method adopted by TCP-Reno). In TCP-BuS, these unnecessary request packets for fast retransmission are avoided.|$|R
50|$|The {{protocol}} handles {{packet loss}} well; QUIC aligns cryptographic block boundaries with packet boundaries, so {{the impact of}} packet loss is even lower. While TCP uses congestion windows to avoid congestion (see: TCP congestion avoidance algorithm), which are unforgiving to multiplexed connections, QUIC has a set of modern techniques under review. Among the techniques being tested are packet pacing (with ongoing bandwidth estimation) and proactive speculative retransmission (<b>sending</b> <b>duplicate</b> copies {{of the most important}} packets, such as the ones containing error correction or initial encryption negotiation).|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe paper {{describes}} the Remote Data Disaster Recovery System using Hash {{to identify and}} avoid <b>sending</b> <b>duplicate</b> data blocks between the Primary Node and the Secondary Node, thereby, to reduce the data replication network bandwidth, decrease overhead and improve network efficiency. On both nodes, some extra storage spaces (the Hash Repositories) besides data disks are used to record the Hash for each data block on data disks. We extend the data replication protocol between the Primary Node and the Secondary Node. When the data, whose Hash exists in the Hash Repository, is duplication, the block address is transferred instead of the data, and that reduces network bandwidth requirement, saves synchronization time, and improves network efficiency...|$|R

Its pernicious tendency is there fully set forth. They were peculiarly called on for a most accurate state of their affairs, in order to explain the necessity of having recourse to such a scheme, as well as for a full and correct account of the scheme itself. But they send only the above short minute by one dispatch over land, whilst the copy of the plan itself, on which the Directors must form their judgment, is sent separately in another dispatch over land, which has never arrived. A third dispatch, which also contained the plan, was sent by a sea conveyance, and arrived late. The Directors have, for very obvious reasons, ordered, by a strict injunction, that they should <b>send</b> <b>duplicates</b> of all their dispatches by every ship. The spirit of this rule, perhaps, ought to extend to every mode of conveyance. In this case, so far from <b>sending</b> a <b>duplicate,</b> they do not send even one perfect account.

40|$|In {{this article}} we show how it is {{possible}} to obtain lower loss rates over the Internet network by using redundant transmission. The redundant transmission idea is {{based on the fact that}} the information can be duplicated and sent to the destination using independent resources. The redundant transmission on a datagram network like the Internet can thus be obtained by sending the same packet over different paths. The source-routing option of the IP protocol is used to send a packet to its destination on a given path. This option is widely supported by the Internet version 6 network. Improvements in the transmission are proved by using a developed software tool. This tool has two main functionalities: the first one consists in discovering the topology of the network between the source and the destination; the second feature of the software consists in <b>sending</b> <b>duplicates</b> of a given packet over non-overlapping paths to the destination...|$|R
40|$|Twitter is an {{efficient}} conduit {{of information for}} millions of users around the world. Its ability to quickly spread information to {{a large number of}} people makes it {{an efficient}} way to shape information and, hence, shape public opinion. We study the tweeting behavior of Twitter propagandists, users who consistently express the same opinion or ideology, focusing on two online communities: the 2010 Nevada senate race and the 2011 debt-ceiling debate. We identify several extreme tweeting patterns that could characterize users who spread propaganda: (1) sending high volumes of tweets over short periods of time, (2) retweeting while publishing little original content, (3) quickly retweeting, and (4) colluding with other, seemingly unrelated, users to <b>send</b> <b>duplicate</b> or near-duplicate messages on the same topic simultaneously. These four features appear to distinguish tweeters who spread propaganda from other more neutral users and could serve as starting point for developing behavioral-based propaganda detection techniques for Twitter. ...|$|R
30|$|HARQ/ARQ {{techniques}} {{for which the}} errored packets at the receiver are retransmitted by the transmitter until either they are successfully decoded or a retransmission limit is reached are not considered in this paper. From TCP perspective, they prove to be powerful techniques to combat with multipath fading in wireless channels {{at the expense of}} increased delay and jitter caused by random retransmissions. Out-of-order packet delivery is another natural consequence of HARQ/ARQ which can be detrimental to TCP throughput if left uncompensated at the receiver [26]. Out-of-order packets force TCP receivers to <b>send</b> <b>duplicate</b> ACKs to TCP transmitters as if the missing packets have been lost which in turn throttles back the transmitterâ€™s packet injection rate to the network. To cope with out-of-order packet arrivals, wireless receivers optionally resequence the arriving packets from the air interface before their delivery to the network [27]. For the analysis of TCP performance over links deploying HARQ/ARQ, one should additionally model the complex effects of the retransmission delays as well as resequencing delays. TCP modeling for AQM-controlled links with HARQ/ARQ is left for future research.|$|R

They also detail the small quantities of freshwater fish taken commercially in inland areas. These data provide the basic background for managing California's commercial fishery resources. The published figures are of national and international significance, and are used by fisheries scientists, legislators, educators, members of the fishing industry, and others interested in the State's fisheries. This report for 1967 is the 27 th in the series of catch bulletins. The first, published in 1929, contained the {{records of the}} 1926 and 1927 commercial fish catches. California's fishery statistics are based on a system whereby fish dealers, processors, and partyboat operators <b>send</b> <b>duplicate</b> copies of their landing records to the Department. The statistical system and methods used to collect the records were fully described in Fish Bulletin 86, which reported the catch for 1950. In the intervening years, methods and equipment have been modified as conditions warranted, but the basic principles have remained unchanged...|$|R
40|$|RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extension for a Third-Party Loss Report In a large RTP session {{using the}} RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) {{feedback}} mechanism defined in RFC 4585, a feedback target may experience transient overload if some event causes {{a large number}} of receivers to send feedback at once.

40|$|The {{ability to}} migrate a virtual machine (VM) from one {{physical}} host to another {{is important in}} a number of cases such as power management, on-line maintenance, and load-balancing. The amount of memory used in VMs have been steadily increasing up to several gigabytes. Consequently, the time to migrate machines, the total migration time, has been increasing. The aim of this thesis is to reduce the total migration time. Previous work aimed at reducing the amount of time and disk space required for saving checkpoint images of virtual machines by excluding data from the memory that is duplicated on the disk of the VM. Other work aimed at reducing the time to restore a VM from a checkpoint by only loading a subset of data before resuming the VM and marking the other memory as invalid. These techniques have been adapted and applied to virtual machine live migration to reduce the total migration time. The implemented technique excludes <b>sending</b> <b>duplicate</b> data that exists on disk and resumes the VM before all memory has been loaded. The proposed technique has been implemented for fully virtualized guests in Xen 4. 1. The results of research conducted with a number of benchmarks demonstrate that there is an average 44 % reduction of the total migration time...|$|R
40|$|Recently, DVB-H (digital video broadcastingâ€“handheld) and DVB-IPDC (IP datacast over DVB-H) {{have been}} {{developed}} to support broadcasting services. DVB-H is designed to support digital video broadcast for handheld devices, while DVB-IPDC can integrate with an IP-relay network to complement the data loss problem in DVB-H. Assuming that WiMAX networks are adopted to support DVB-IPDC, this paper points out two critical problems: group packet loss (GPL) and broadcast data handover (BDH). GPL occurs when there is a burst of retransmission requests for the same pieces of data with high spatial or temporal correlation. BDH happens when some devices that made the above requests handover to new serving cells. To solve these problems, we propose a lazy wait and a group acknowledgement schemes to alleviate duplicate requests by exploiting their spatial and temporal correlation. This not only reduces the requests submitted by neighboring devices in both space and time domains, but also avoids handovering devices from <b>sending</b> <b>duplicate</b> requests in new cells. Through mathematical analysis, we show how to adaptively adjust the timers of lazy wait and group acknowledgement based on channel quality. Simulation results prove that our schemes can efficiently reduce retransmission requests and retransmission packets, thus alleviating congestion in the IP-relay network.

30|$|In a TCP session, the {{delivery}} of out-of-order packets can happen in either direction, i.e. it can happen with data packets or ACK packets. The sender detects out-of-order delivery of ACK packets from the ACK sequence number, since every new ACK sequence number must be greater than the previous one if the ACKs are received in correct order. However, two duplicate ACKs have the same contents. Therefore, additional information is required to detect out-of-order delivery. In this regard, it is proposed to add a one byte TCP option to the TCP-ACK header called an ACK duplication sequence number (ADSN). The initial value of the ADSN will be zero with each ACK, while <b>sending</b> a <b>duplicate</b> ACK for the same sequence number will trigger an increment in the ADSN number.|$|R
