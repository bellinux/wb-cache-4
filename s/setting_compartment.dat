40|$|AbstractThe engrailed gene is {{well known}} from its role in {{segmentation}} and central nervous system development {{in a variety of}} species. In molluscs, however, engrailed is involved in shell formation. So far, it seemed that engrailed had been co-opted uniquely for this particular process in molluscs. Here, we show that, in the gastropod mollusc Patella vulgata, an engrailed ortholog is expressed in the edge of the embryonic shell and in the anlage of the apical sensory organ. Surprisingly, a dpp-BMP 2 / 4 ortholog is expressed in cells of the ectoderm surrounding, but not overlapping, the engrailed-expressing shell-forming cells. It is also expressed in the anlage of the eyes. Earlier it was shown that a compartment boundary exists between the cells of the embryonic shell and the adjacent ectoderm. We conclude that engrailed and dpp are most likely involved in <b>setting</b> up a <b>compartment</b> boundary between these cells, very similar to the situation in, for example, the developing wing imaginal disc in Drosophila. We suggest that engrailed became involved in shell formation because of its ancestral role, which is to <b>set</b> up <b>compartment</b> boundaries between embryonic domains...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Turing {{patterns}} can {{be observed}} in reaction-diffusion systems where chemical species have different diffusion constants. In recent years, several studies investigated the effects of noise on Turing patterns and showed that the parameter regimes, for which stochastic Turing patterns are observed, can be larger than the parameter regimes predicted by deterministic models, which are written in terms of partial differential equations for species concen-trations. A common stochastic reaction-diffusion approach is written in terms of compartment-based (lattice-based) models, where the domain of interest is divided into artificial compartments and the number of molecules in each compartment is simulated. In this paper, the dependence of stochastic Turing patterns on the compartment size is investigated. It has previously been shown (for relatively simpler systems) that a modeller should not choose compart-ment sizes which are too small or too large, and that the optimal compartment size depends on the diffusion constant. Taking these results into account, we propose and study a compartment-based model of Turing patterns where each chemical species is described using a different <b>set</b> of <b>compartments.</b> It is shown that the parameter regions where spatial patterns form are different from the regions obtained by classical deterministic PDE-based models, but they are also different from the results obtained for the stochastic reaction-diffusion models which use a single <b>set</b> of <b>compartments</b> for all chemical species.

40|$|A {{controversial}} {{issue in the}} eye movement field involves the compartmentalization of extraocular muscle (EOM). Conventionally, it has been believed that each individual EOM is innervated uniformly by its motor nerve, and behaves uniformly. However, recent studies have revealed that motor nerves innervating horizontal rectus EOMs are bifurcated into two divisions that control, respectively, the superior and inferior zones of muscle fibers. This finding has motivated the proposition {{that each of the}} two compartments of these EOMs might be controlled independently, so that each EOM could behave as it were two parallel but independent actuators. The compartmental independence postulate requires a mechanically low degree of transverse force coupling among parallel EOM and extraocular tendon (EOT) fibers. This project aimed to employ biomechanical characterization to EOM and EOT to test the plausibility of this hypothesis. The first study described the biomechanical characterization of EOT, in both at the level of individual fibers and whole tendon. Nano indentation of EOT fiber bundles analyzed within the Hertzian framework effectively characterized the transverse Young's modulus for bovine EOT fiber bundles using atomic force microscopy (AFM). A precise estimate of the Poisson ratio (PR) of bovine EOTs was calculated using optical coherence tomography (OCT) during tensile loading. The second study investigated mechanical potential for independent compartmental behavior in EOM and EOT. Extensive experimental study was performed to examine the passive mechanical interaction between <b>sets</b> <b>compartments</b> using a custom fabricated dual channel micro-tensile load cell. Independent active contractile behavior of EOM compartments was also examined using calcium-induced EOM contraction. Both passive loading and active contraction findings indicate that EOM and tendon have a high degree of biomechanical independence, sufficient to support the proposed functional diversity of actions in distinct neuromuscular compartments of the horizontal rectus EOMs. Finally, biomechanical effects of Z-tenotomy and Z-myotomy, surgical techniques employing transverse incisions for EOT or EOM weakening to correct strabismus (misalignment of the eyes), were characterized using tensile loading. Both Z-tenotomy and Z-myotomy demonstrated minimal shear force coupling, which confirms and extends the findings of independent compartmental behavior in second study, and explains the surgical effects of the procedure. Additional viscoelastic characterization was performed using EOM specimens...|$|R

40|$|First {{published}} as an Advance Article {{on the web}} 12 th May 2003 Previous {{studies have shown that}} tobacco plants are tolerant of perchlorate and will accumulate perchlorate in plant tissues. This research determined the uptake, translocation, and accumulation of perchlorate in tobacco plants. Three hydroponics growth studies were completed under greenhouse conditions. Depletion of perchlorate in the hydroponics nutrient solution and accumulation of perchlorate in plant tissues were determined at two-day intervals using ion chromatography. Perchlorate primarily accumulated in tobacco leaves, yielding a substantial storage capacity for perchlorate. Mass balance results show that perchlorate degradation was negligible in plants. Tobacco plants were shown to effectively accumulate perchlorate over a wide range of initial concentrations (10 ppb to 100 ppm) from the hydroponics solution. Results suggest that tobacco plants are potential plants for the phytoremediation of perchlorate.

Its structure is perturbed during ontogeny, disease and experimental manipulation. Transmission electron microscopy and second-order stereological tools (cross covariance and cross correlation functions) were used to examine 3 -D spatial interactions between the main tissue compartments (glomerular capillaries, podocytes, mesangium, urinary space) of the renal corpuscle in normal adult rats. Volume densities, covariance and correlation functions were estimated by counting test points (randomly positioned) and linear dipole probes (randomly positioned and orientated) superimposed on random samples of photomontages prepared from ultrathin resin sections. Differences in clustering exist between compartments (at distances 8 Î¼m, compartments are neither hypodisperse nor hyperdisperse).

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the level of}} bone formation in the different bone compartments in cases of established osteoporosis, as previous work has concentrated on trabecular bone alone. METHODS: Bone formation rates were measured histomorphometrically, in the periosteal (P), cortical (C), subcortical (SC), and trabecular (T) compartments in iliac crest biopsies from 159 patients with established osteoporosis. The values were standardised using age and sex matched control data and patterns of differential change determined by analysis of parametric status (increased, normal, reduced). RESULTS: Mean bone formation was reduced in all four compartments. This was more marked (4. 4 / 4. 1 standard deviations below the mean in C/T, v 2. 3 / 0. 9 in P/SC) and more frequent (reduced in 81. 5 %/ 78. 3 % in T/C, v 43. 3 %/ 44 % in P/SC) in the trabecular and cortical compartments than in the periosteal or subcortical bone. Parametric status was equal in trabecular and cortical bone in 85. 4 % of cases, and in periosteal and subcortical bone in 65. 7 %, but in all four compartments in only 35. 1 %, indicating differential alteration of bone formation in the two <b>sets</b> of <b>compartments</b> (T/C v P/SC). CONCLUSIONS: Altered trabecular bone formation is important in osteoporosis, but there are differential patterns of alteration in the other three compartments, emphasising the presence of different microenvironments in bone; thus {{the effect on the}} cortical compartment was similar to that on the trabecular, while the subcortical and periosteal compartments also showed linkage.
