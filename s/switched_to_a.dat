5|$|In 1931, the World Championships <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> similar {{format to}} what was used at the Olympics. Ten teams played series of {{round-robin}} format qualifying rounds were played to determine which nations participated in the medal round. Medals were awarded based on the final standings of the teams in the medal round. The format was changed {{several times in the}} 1930s, in some years there was a gold medal game, while in others the gold medal was awarded based on points.|$|E
5|$|In August 1931, Amazing was {{acquired}} by Teck Publications, a subsidiary of Bernarr Macfadden's Macfadden Publications. Macfadden's deep pockets helped insulate Amazing from the financial strain caused by the Great Depression. The schedule of Amazing Stories Quarterly began to slip, but Amazing did not miss {{an issue in the}} early 1930s. However, it became unprofitable to publish over the next few years. Circulation dropped to little more than 25,000 in 1934, and in October 1935 it <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bimonthly schedule.|$|E

5|$|Merwin {{succeeded in}} making Startling popular and successful, and the {{bimonthly}} schedule was resumed in 1947. At the start of 1952 Startling <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> monthly schedule; this was unusual in that Startling was notionally junior to Thrilling Wonder, its sister magazine, which remained bimonthly. Merwin left shortly before this switch, in order {{to spend more time}} on his own writing. He was replaced by Samuel Mines, who had worked with Standard's Western magazines, though he was a science fiction aficionado.|$|E
5|$|Moon {{played a}} four, then a five-piece drum kit during his early career. His 1965 set {{consisted}} of Ludwig drums and Zildjian cymbals. By 1966, feeling limited {{by this setup}} and inspired by Ginger Baker's double bass drum, he <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> larger Premier kit. This setup {{did not have a}} hi-hat, since Moon used crash and ride cymbals instead. He remained a loyal customer of Premier.|$|E
5|$|Priyanka Chopra {{stars as}} Alex Parrish, a bright FBI recruit who joins the agency {{after graduating from}} the FBI Academy and becomes a prime suspect of a {{terrorist}} attack on Grand Central Terminal.

The series <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> single timeline in mid-second season.|$|E

5|$|The Republic of Croatia is {{a unitary}} state using a {{parliamentary}} system of governance. With {{the collapse of}} the ruling communist party in SFR Yugoslavia, Croatia organized its first multi-party elections and adopted its present constitution in 1990. It declared independence on 8 October 1991 which led to the break-up of Yugoslavia and countries international recognition by the United Nations in 1992. Under its 1990 constitution, Croatia operated a semi-presidential system until 2000 when it <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> parliamentary system. Government powers in Croatia are divided into legislative, executive and judiciary powers.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing for}} the local youth team of San Vendemiano, Del Piero used to feature as a goalkeeper, {{in order to gain}} more playing time. His mother thought {{it would be better for}} him to play in this role as he would not sweat, and the {{possibility}} of him getting injured was less likely. His brother Stefano commented to their mother that, due to his skill, Alessandro was more suited to playing in a more offensive position, and Del Piero <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> forward role.|$|E
5|$|By the 2005–06 season, {{clubs in}} England were {{increasingly}} {{in favour of}} using the 4–5–1 system. Wenger, having earlier suggested he would never resort to a negative system, later adopted the formation for Champions League matches. The decision to pack the midfield and play a lone striker resulted in Arsenal reaching the final. With Fábregas breaking into the first team, Wenger chose to deviate from their counter-attacking style, to a more possession based one. In 2009–10, he instituted a fluid 4–3–3 formation to benefit from Fàbregas' creativity, and since the player's departure, had remodelled the system to 4–1–4–1 and 4–2–3–1. During {{the latter half of}} the 2016–17 Premier League season, Wenger <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 3-4-3 formation first used against Middlesbrough in a 1-2 win.|$|E

5|$|David Bunnell joined MITS as a {{technical}} writer in the calculator heyday. In April 1975 he created a newsletter so the MITS staff could easily communicate with the customers. The newsletter, Computer Notes, was available to customers and other interested readers. It was a large format newsletter; 11.25 by 15.5inches (286 by 394mm), and each issue had 8 to 24 pages. In January 1977, it <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> smaller magazine format and the last issue was produced in January 1978. Bunnell started Personal Computer magazine in October 1976 {{and went on to}} a successful career as a magazine publisher.|$|E
5|$|Development of Space Race {{began in}} Summer 1972 {{under the name}} Asteroid by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, based on ideas by him and co-founder Ted Dabney. The final design was done by Dabney, {{possibly}} with assistance by Bushnell and Pong designer Allan Alcorn. The game was planned to be quick to create to fulfill an earlier contract with Bally Midway. The engineering and prototyping was done by Alcorn; after it was completed and the design given to Midway to be released as Asteroid, Atari produced its own nearly identical version as Space Race. Fifty Space Race cabinets were produced using a fiberglass design by George Faraco {{before the rest of}} the production was <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cheaper standard cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Dick Harp was in {{the midst}} of his first season as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game. Kansas came into the season favored to win the {{national}} title. This was due in large part to Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules. At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the starting line up during the season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E

5|$|Greene {{retired as}} a player {{following}} the 1981 season. He finished his career having played in 181 {{out of a possible}} 190 games, and recorded 78.5 sacks (unofficially, as sacks were not an official statistic until 1982) and 16 fumble recoveries. His spot in the lineup was technically not replaced; the Steelers <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 3–4 defensive alignment for the 1982 season, which has only one nose tackle as opposed to two defensive tackles. The team has used the 3–4 as its base alignment continuously in the years since Greene's retirement, and more recently have used alignments that deploy only two true linemen.|$|E
5|$|Higginbotham's {{desire to}} play regular first-team {{football}} led to him joining Derby County for a £2million fee – {{a large sum}} for a young player with just four top-flight appearances to his name. His decision to leave Manchester United was praised by the player he failed to displace, Denis Irwin. Higginbotham made his debut in a 2–2 draw with Southampton, and had a good start to his Derby career until he was substituted at half-time during his third appearance after struggling to contain Everton's Niclas Alexandersson. Manager Jim Smith soon <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new system without any full-backs but Higginbotham adapted well to playing on the left-side of a three-man defence. Derby avoid relegation out of the Premier League on the penultimate day of 2000–01 with a 1–0 victory over former his club Manchester United at Old Trafford.|$|E
5|$|In April 1963, Galaxy Publishing {{brought out}} {{the first issue of}} Worlds of Tomorrow, another science-fiction {{magazine}}, also edited by Pohl. The magazine published some well-received material and was profitable, but Guinn, the publisher and owner, decided in 1967 {{that it would be better}} to have Galaxy resume a monthly schedule; both Worlds of Tomorrow and Galaxy were bimonthly at that time, while If was monthly. With the August 1967 issue Worlds of Tomorrow was merged with If, though it was another year before Galaxy actually <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> monthly schedule. By this time, If had become monthly again, starting with the July 1964 issue (though the schedule had an initial hiccup, omitting September 1964).|$|E
