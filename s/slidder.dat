60|$|LITTLE <b>SLIDDER</b> RESISTS TEMPTATION SUCCESSFULLY, AND I BECOME ENSLAVED.|$|E
60|$|RELATES GENERALLY TO THE DOINGS AND SAYINGS OF ROBIN <b>SLIDDER.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>Slidder</b> {{was doomed}} to disappointment. He reached the Black Bull {{at two o'clock}} precisely.|$|E
60|$|On hearing this, little <b>Slidder's</b> eyes {{began to}} open and glisten till they outshone his own buttons.|$|R
6000|$|... "So like," [...] murmured the old woman, as {{she gazed}} in <b>Slidder's</b> face. [...] "And {{it is so}} {{good of you to}} give up your play and come to look after a {{helpless}} old creature like me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Be {{sure your}} sins {{will find you}} out," [...] says Torrigiano. [...] "Go with him and see." [...] As I {{followed}} Bob out I was aware of Benedetto, like a black spot when the eyes are tired, <b>sliddering</b> up behind me.|$|R
60|$|And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in {{and then}} <b>slidder</b> off again.|$|E
60|$|In these {{circumstances}} I also resolved {{to take a}} holiday, and join Robin <b>Slidder</b> in his trip to York.|$|E
60|$|When I rose to go, <b>Slidder</b> said {{he would}} call Mrs Jones to mount guard, {{and give me a}} convoy home.|$|E
50|$|Martius yellow stains {{have been}} used to stain {{erythrocytes}} yellow so that they contrast well with red fibrin in trichrome staining methods such as Lendrum's Picro Mallory and <b>Slidder's</b> Martius, Scarlet and Blue (MSB). It can be combined with other small molecular weight yellow dyes to increase stain intensity.|$|R
60|$|After breakfast we three {{hurried out}} and wended our way eastward. As {{the morning was}} unusually fine I diverged towards {{one of the more}} fashionable localities to deliver a note with which I had been charged. Young <b>Slidder's</b> spirits were high, and for a {{considerable}} time he entertained me with {{a good deal of the}} East-end gossip. Among other things, he told me of the great work that was being done there by Dr Barnardo and others of similar spirit, in rescuing waifs like himself from their wretched condition.|$|R
25|$|A {{class action}} lawsuit was {{initiated}} in the Supreme Court of Victoria on 13 February 2009 by <b>Slidders</b> Lawyers against electricity distribution company SP AusNet, {{in relation to}} the Kilmore East fire that became part of the Kinglake complex, and the Beechworth fires. A partner at the firm indicated that the claim would centre on alleged negligence by SP AusNet in its management of electricity infrastructure. On 12 February police had taken away a section of power line as well as a power pole from near Kilmore East, part of a two-kilometre section of line that fell on the morning of 7 February and was believed to have started the fire there.|$|R
60|$|In {{a little}} schoolroom, not far distant from our abode, that {{game was played}} by Edie--assisted by Robin <b>Slidder</b> and myself--with {{considerable}} success.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} are, my dear fellow," [...] {{returned}} the doctor with enthusiasm. [...] "But--to change the subject--has little <b>Slidder</b> been here to-day?" ...|$|E
60|$|Little <b>Slidder</b> had rushed excitedly {{into the}} room, but stopped {{abruptly}} on observing Miss Blythe, {{who was looking}} from him to me with intense surprise.|$|E
60|$|I was now alone {{upon the}} rock, which {{gave me the}} more room; the brandy was singing in my ears; I had this good example fresh before me, and just wit enough to see that if I did not leap at once, I should never leap at all. I bent low {{on my knees and}} flung myself forth, with that kind of anger of despair that has {{sometimes}} stood me in stead of courage. Sure enough, it was but my hands that reached the full length; these slipped, caught again, slipped again; and I was <b>sliddering</b> back into the lynn, when Alan seized me, first by the hair, then by the collar, and with a great strain dragged me into safety.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I knowed Frankie {{would never}} let 'em smell London smoke, but plenty good men in Rye was two-three minded about the upshot. 'Twas {{the noise of the}} gun-fire tarrified us. The wind favoured it our way from off behind the Isle of Wight. It made a mutter like, which growed and growed, {{and by the end of}} a week women was shruckin' in the streets. Then they come slidderin' past Fairlight in a great smoky pat vambrished with red gun-fire, and our ships flyin' forth and duckin' in again. The smoke-pat <b>sliddered</b> over to the French shore, so I knowed Frankie was edgin' the Spanishers toward they Dutch sands where he was master. I says to my Aunt, [...] "The smoke's thinnin' out. I lay Frankie's just about scrapin' his hold for a few last rounds shot. 'Tis time for me to go." ...|$|R
60|$|Poor <b>Slidder's</b> {{temperament}} was sanguine. Slight encouragement {{raised his}} hopes very high. Failure depressed him proportionally and woefully low, but, to do him justice, he never sorrowed long. In the present instance, {{he left the}} Black Bull grinding his teeth. Then he took to clanking his heels as he walked along {{in a way that}} drew forth the comments of several street-boys, to whom, in a spirit of liberality, he returned considerably more than he received. Then he began to mutter between his teeth his private opinion as to faithless persons in general, and faithless Villum, alias the Slogger, in particular, whose character he painted to himself in extremely sombre colours. After that, a heavy thunder-shower having fallen and drenched him, he walked recklessly and violently through every puddle in his path. This seemed to relieve his spirit, for when he reached Hoboy Crescent he had recovered much of his wonted equanimity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who's Robin, granny?" [...] demanded young <b>Slidder,</b> in some surprise, {{looking over}} his {{shoulder}} as he stooped at the fire to stir a pan of gruel.|$|E
60|$|At first little <b>Slidder</b> felt {{inclined}} to laugh, but the doctor's face was so unusually stern {{that he thought}} better of it, and went away much impressed.|$|E
60|$|On {{reaching}} Mrs Willis's little dwelling, I found young <b>Slidder</b> officiating at the tea-table. I {{could not}} resist watching him a moment {{through a crack in}} the door before entering.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say I'm one o' {{the good}} sort, sir," [...] {{suggested}} <b>Slidder,</b> in a hoarse whisper. [...] "Of course, it ain't true, but wot o' that, if it relieves her mind?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is, sir--Robin <b>Slidder,</b> at your sarvice," [...] {{replied the}} urchin, {{giving me a}} {{familiar}} nod. [...] "'Ope your leg ain't so cranky as it wos, sir. Gittin' all square, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{quite so}} unaccountable as you think," [...] {{interrupted}} <b>Slidder,</b> who stood looking calmly on, {{with his hands}} in his pockets and a grin on his face.--"It's your own dog, miss." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please, sir," [...] said <b>Slidder,</b> sidling up to me, [...] "if you wants mutton-chops, or steaks, or port wine, or anythink o' that sort, {{just say}} the word and I'll get 'em." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{fear not}} <b>Slidder,</b> for I have already {{given it to}} the young lady, and you have seen how fond she is of it; and the dog evidently likes her better than it likes me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} b'lieve it, miss, {{look at the}} vite spot {{on the bridge of}} 'is nose," [...] said <b>Slidder,</b> with a self-satisfied nod to the lady and a supremely insolent wink to the footman.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said Mrs McTougall {{one evening}} to the doctor, [...] "since {{that little boy}} <b>Slidder</b> came {{to stay with us}} things have become worse and worse; in fact, the house is almost unbearable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am Mister <b>Slidder,</b> sir! And I would 'ave you remember," [...] {{said the}} urchin, with dignity, [...] "that every Englishman's 'ouse is his castle, and that neither imperence nor flunkies 'as {{a right to}} enter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Dumps, {{come here}} and let's be friends. Who {{do you think is}} coming to stay with us--to stay altogether? You'll never guess. Your old friend and first master, little <b>Slidder,</b> no less. Think of that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Robin--Robin is my name now, Villum Bowls. I've {{changed it}} since we met last, though I hain't cut old friends like you. Robin an' <b>Slidder</b> 'ave been united, an' a pretty pair they make, don't they?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs Willis smiled, sneezed, {{and began}} her gruel. <b>Slidder,</b> {{who looked at}} her with deep interest, was called away by a knock at the door. Opening it he beheld a tall footman, with a parcel in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are Robin," [...] {{returned}} {{the old lady}} following up the remark with a feeble sneeze. [...] "I can't stand <b>Slidder.</b> It is such an ugly name. Besides, {{you ought to have}} a Christian name, child. Don't you like Robin?" ...|$|E
60|$|Saying this, young <b>Slidder</b> {{began to}} eat another muffin {{with a degree of}} zest that seemed to give the lie direct to his assertion, so that I could not refrain from observing that he {{did not seem to be}} {{particularly}} ill.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; honour bright!" [...] exclaimed <b>Slidder,</b> with, for {{the first}} time, a {{somewhat}} abashed look in his face; [...] "I wouldn't for {{the wealth of the}} Injies say a word to nobody wotsomever. It's only atween ourselves that I wentur's to--" ...|$|E
60|$|For some {{minutes after}} that <b>Slidder</b> devoted himself to {{vigorous}} stirring of the gruel, and to repressed laughter, which latter made him very {{red in the}} face, and caused his shoulders to heave convulsively. At last he sought relief in occasional mutterings.|$|E
