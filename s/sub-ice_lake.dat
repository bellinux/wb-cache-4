40|$|A 2 D {{time-dependent}} thermo-mechanical model, including ice–water {{phase change}} and sedimentation process, is developed {{to study the}} effects of planetary heat loss and sedimentation rate on the time scale for melting and on the mechanical and hydrological stability of <b>sub-ice</b> <b>lake</b> scenario. The results show that planetary heat loss greater than 25 mW/m 2 and sedimentation rates between 0. 1 and 0. 001 mm/yr are able to produce stable melting process, reaching a water thickness greater than 1. 3 km. These parameters fully agree with the estimates obtained by geological and morphological observations. Afterwards, the water stored within the crater can be rapidly discharged toward the surface through fractures in the sediment cap. The consequent collapse would be 1. 3 – 1. 5 km, which agrees with the amount subsidence observed for Aram Chaos...|$|E
40|$|Hesperian chaotic terrains {{have been}} {{recognized}} {{as the source of}} outflow channels formed by catastrophic outflows. Four main scenarios have been proposed for the formation of chaotic terrains that involve different amounts of water and single or multiple outflow events. Here, we test these scenarios with morphological and structural analyses of imagery and elevation data for Aram Chaos in conjunction with numerical modeling of the morphological evolution of the catastrophic carving of the outflow valley. The morphological and geological analyses of Aram Chaos suggest large-scale collapse and subsidence (1500 m) of the entire area, which is consistent with a massive expulsion of liquid water from the subsurface in one single event. The combined observations suggest a complex process starting with the outflow of water from two small channels, followed by continuous groundwater sapping and headward erosion and ending with a catastrophic lake rim collapse and carving of the Aram Valley, which is synchronous with the 2. 5 Ga stage of the Ares Vallis formation. The water volume and formative time scale required to carve the Aram channels indicate that a single, rapid (maximum tens of days) and catastrophic (flood volume of 9. 3 ? 104 km 3) event carved the outflow channel. We conclude that a <b>sub-ice</b> <b>lake</b> collapse model can best explain the features of the Aram Chaos Valley system as well as the time scale required for its formation.

40|$|Vostok Subglacial Lake is {{the largest}} and best known <b>sub-ice</b> <b>lake</b> in Antarctica. The {{establishment}} of its water depth (> 500 m) led to an appreciation that such environments may be habitats for life and could contain ancient records of ice sheet change, which catalyzed plans for exploration and research. Here we discuss geophysical data used to identify the lake and the likely physical, chemical, and biological processes that occur in it. The lake is more than 250 km long and around 80 km wide in one place. It lies beneath 4. 2 to 3. 7 km of ice and exists because background levels of geothermal heating are sufficient to warm the ice base to the pressure melting value. Seismic and gravity measurements show the lake has two distinct basins. The Vostok ice core extracted > 200 m of ice accreted from the lake to the ice sheet base. Analysis of this ice has given valuable insights into the lake s biological and chemical setting. The inclination of the ice-water interface leads to differential basal melting in the north versus freezing in the south, which excites circulation and potential mixing of the water. The exact nature of circulation depends on hydrochemical properties, which are not known at this stage. The age of the subglacial lake {{is likely to be}} as old as the ice sheet (approx. 14 Ma). The age of the water within the lake will be related to the age of the ice melting into it and the level of mixing. Rough estimates put that combined age as approx. 1 Ma...|$|E
40|$|The {{perennial}} ice covered lakes of the Antarctic {{are considered}} to be excellent analogues to lakes that once existed on Mars. Field studies of ice covered lakes, paleolakes, and polar beaches were conducted in the Bunger Hills Oasis, Eastern Antarctica. These studies are extended to the Dry Valleys, Western Antarctica, and the Arctic. Important distinctions were made between ice covered and non-ice covered bodies of water in terms of the geomorphic signatures produced. The most notable landforms produced by ice covered lakes are ice shoved ridges. These features form discrete segmented ramparts of boulders and sediments pushed up along the shores of <b>lakes</b> and/or seas. <b>Sub-ice</b> <b>lakes</b> have been discovered under the Antarctic ice sheet using radio echo sounding. These lakes occur in regions of low surface slope, low surface accumulations, and low ice velocity, and occupy bedrock hollows. The presence of <b>sub-ice</b> <b>lakes</b> below the Martian polar caps is possible. The discovery of the Antarctic <b>sub-ice</b> <b>lakes</b> raises possibilities concerning Martian lakes and exobiology...|$|R
