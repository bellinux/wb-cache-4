The Mexican government under President Álvaro Obregón wanted recognition before negotiations, but Wilson and his final Secretary of State, Bainbridge Colby, refused. Both Hughes and Fall opposed recognition; Hughes instead sent a draft treaty to the Mexicans in May 1921, which included pledges to reimburse Americans for losses in Mexico since the 1910 revolution there. Obregón {{was unwilling to}} sign a treaty before being recognized, and worked to improve the relationship between American business and Mexico, reaching agreement with creditors, and mounting a public relations campaign in the United States. This had its effect, and by mid-1922, Fall was less influential than he had been, lessening the resistance to recognition. The two presidents appointed commissioners to reach a deal, and the U.S. recognized the Obregón government on August 31, 1923, just under a month after Harding's death, substantially on the terms proffered by Mexico.|$|E

40|$|Given a self-similar set E {{generated}} by a finite system Ψ of contracting similitudes of a complete metric space X we analyze a separation condition for Ψ, which is obtained if, in the open <b>set</b> <b>condition,</b> the open subset of X is replaced with an open set in the topology of E as a metric subspace of X.

Using properties of subselfsimilar sets, we find a method which allows us to obtain the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of the dynamical boundary and the overlapping set in the case when X is the n-dimensional Euclidean space and Ψ satisfies the open <b>set</b> <b>condition.</b> We show that, in this case, the dimension of these sets is strictly less than the dimension of the set E...|$|R
