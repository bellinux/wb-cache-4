30|$|On {{the other}} hand, we may also detect {{offshore}} tsunami signals using other measurements. One possible method is ship-borne GNSS positioning.

Offshore tsunami of 0.1  m due to the 2010 Maule, Chile, earthquake was successfully detected by GNSS-based height of a research vessel (Foster et al. 2012). A fine spatial-scale geoidal variation was possibly captured by GNSS height of a navigating commercial ship (Roggenbuck et al. 2014). Routine recording of GNSS height of a navigating ferryboat may be useful for monitoring of sea-surface height spatiotemporal variations that reflect the Tsushima Warm Current (Ichikawa et al. 2013).

3000|$|Nankai Trough great {{earthquake}} tsunami will {{be observed}} by the kinematic PPP height positioning of an AIS-derived ship distribution, {{and examined the}} tsunami forecast capability of the offshore tsunami measurements based on the PPP-based <b>ship</b> <b>height.</b> A method to estimate the initial tsunami height distribution using offshore tsunami observations was used for forecasting. Tsunami forecast tests were carried out using simulated tsunami data by the PPP-based <b>ship</b> <b>height</b> of 92 cargo ships/tankers, and by currently operating deep-sea pressure and Global Positioning System (GPS) buoy observations at 71 stations over the Nankai Trough. The forecast capability using the PPP-based height of the 92 ships was shown to be comparable to or better than that using the operating offshore observatories at the 71 stations. We suppose that, immediately after the occurrence of a great earthquake, stations receiving successive ship information (AIS data) along certain areas of the coast would fail to acquire ship data due to strong ground shaking, especially near the epicenter. Such a situation would significantly deteriorate the tsunami-forecast capability using ship data. On the other hand, operational real-time analysis of seismic/geodetic data would be carried out for estimating a tsunamigenic fault model. Incorporating the seismic/geodetic fault model estimation into the tsunami forecast above possibly compensates for the deteriorated forecast capability.|$|R
30|$|The data {{interval}} for {{the forecast}} {{in the present}} study is taken as 3 – 10 or 3 – 20  min after the tsunami generation, as shown later. The first 3 -min data are omitted because the sea surface and bottom are expected to be significantly affected by elastic wave effects immediately after the earthquake (Nosov and Kolesov 2007; Saito 2013). In the tsunami forecast tests, λ is empirically fixed, respectively, for using the data from the operating offshore observatories, and for using the PPP <b>ship</b> <b>height</b> data (Inazu and Saito 2014).|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study, the GNSS-based <b>ship</b> <b>height</b> was {{investigated}} to measure offshore tsunamis.

GNSS-reflectometry using numerous GNSS satellites and LEO satellites {{may also be a}} promising technique for detecting offshore tsunamis over vast areas of ocean in a relatively short time interval (Stosius et al. 2010).

Possible geophysical corrections were carried out on the height records. Static geoidal height which depends on location (~ 101  m) was primarily removed using the EGM 2008 model (Pavlis et al. 2012).

The random noises are generated by inverse Fourier transform with phase randomization of the power spectra of Fig.  1 d. The noises based on PPP are added to the tsunami time series, which is used as the <b>ship</b> <b>height</b> pseudo observation. Since the ship velocities are 100  m/s (Fig.  1 c), ship movements during the tsunami passing over the offshore ships (~ 30  min) are expected to be < 10  km, which is not considered in the present study. The pseudo observation data of the ships are thus generated at fixed points (Fig.  3 b). GPS buoy noises (Fig.  1 d) are added to the GPS buoy observation. No noise is added to the deep-sea pressure observation which is sensitive to subcentimeter tsunamis (Filloux 1982; Hino et al. 2001; Inazu and Saito 2014).|$|R

40|$|Fremantle Port is Western Australia's largest {{general cargo}} port and has {{experienced}} more than 10, 660 ship visits since 2011. The burning of marine fuels, however, significantly affects air quality in nearby areas. As {{there are no}} air pollution monitoring stations in Fremantle, the impact of emissions from Fremantle port is largely unknown. There is one air pollution modelling study for Fremantle Port (Rolfe, 2016), which was carried out with AERMOD, a steady-state Gaussian plume dispersion model, known to have limitations in its applicability for use in coastal areas. As part of the Rolfe (2016) study, an hourly emissions inventory was created using publicly available data, but the sensitivity of AERMOD to key assumptions and parameters used in developing the inventory were not tested. Therefore, the aims of this thesis were to 1) repeat the study by Rolfe (2016) in order {{to carry out a}} sensitivity study on key assumptions and parameters used in the calculation of the emission inventory, and 2) compare the steady-state Gaussian plume model, AERMOD, versus a Lagrangian puff model, CALPUFF, which is more suitable for use in coastal regions. Results showed that, among the several parameters tested, AERMOD was highly sensitive to driving meteorology and <b>ship</b> stack <b>height.</b> Meteorology over water and shorter stack heights resulted in the highest concentrations. Regulatory exceedances of the 1 hour average for SO 2 occurred for several simulations.
