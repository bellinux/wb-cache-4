40|$|Predators {{commonly}} share prey {{with human}} exploiters, intuitively {{suggesting that there}} is an inherent human-predator conflict through competition for prey. Here we studied the effects of fishing and predation mortality on biomass distributions and yields of shared prey using a size-structured model of competing populations, describing the life histories of Baltic Sea sprat and herring. Whereas both species responded in a similar fashion to increased fishing mortality, with decreasing juvenile and adult biomasses, we found that responses to predation mortality differed between <b>species.</b> <b>Sprat</b> only display weak compensatory responses with increasing predation mortality, while over a substantial range of mortalities there was a strong increase in adult (and total) herring biomass, i. e. overcompensation. The observed biomass overcompensation results from relaxed intraspecific competition as predation mortality increased, allowing for faster individual growth rates that in turn lead to a change in population composition (juvenile:adult biomass ratio). Our results suggest that the potential for biomass overcompensation is higher for species exhibiting substantial growth after maturation. Differences in size-selectivity of predators and fishing mortality resulted in a positive effect of predation mortality on fisheries yields, which can be explained by an overcompensatory response in adult herring biomass. Thus, somewhat counter intuitive, our results suggest that fishermen, depending on prey life history, may actually benefit from allowing for a higher abundance of predators, despite competing for shared prey...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{changes have}} taken place in the pelagic {{ecosystem}} of the Central Baltic Sea during the last decade. Owing to a combination of high fishing pressure and unfavourable hydrographic conditions, the cod (Gadus morhua) stock as the top predator in the system was reduced from a high level in the early 1980 s to its lowest size on record in the early 1990 s. The preferred prey <b>species</b> <b>sprat</b> (Sprattus sprattus) showed a significant increase in population size since the late 1980 s to the highest level on record in recent years, while the herring (Clupea harengus), another important planktivore in the system, did not show such a response. We investigate whether fluctuations in clupeid stock size cascade down to the trophic level of mesozooplankton, based on stomach content data and daily ration estimates in combination with stock sizes estimated from Multispecies Virtual Population Analysis. Estimates of daily consumption by the populations of the two species for 1978 â€“ 1990 were compared with standing stocks of mesozooplankton species. No evidence was found for food limitation as might be expected if clupeids exert a strong top-down control on mesozooplankton. Also no influence on interannual variability of mesozooplankton abundance was detected. However, predation did contribute to the seasonal development of two copepod species (Pseudocalanus elongatus and Temora longicornis) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} based on stomach content from 42 harbour {{porpoises}} bycaught or stranded between April to June in 2002 and 2003, on the Turkish western Black Sea coast. Seven fish <b>species</b> were identified. <b>Sprat</b> and whiting {{were the most important}} fish species in the diet by frequency of occurrence (64. 1 % and 23. 6 %, respectively). Besides fishes, crustaceans, pieces of algae, molluscs, bivalves, sand and plastic debris were also recorded...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{changes in}} the diet {{composition}} and trophic niche overlap were examined for the dominant members of the fish assemblage of the turbid low-salinity zone of the Scheldt estuary (Belgium). Samples of fish were taken in the cooling water of a power plant. Juveniles of eight species dominated the fish assemblage: two goby <b>species,</b> herring, <b>sprat,</b> bass, flounder, eel and pikeperch. Together, they had preyed upon 31 different prey taxa. Calanoid copepods and hyperbenthic mysids {{were the most important}} prey items with macrobenthic invertebrates being largely ignored. Pair-wise comparisons of trophic niche overlap showed that, in general, niche overlap between individuals of the same species was significantly higher than overlap between individuals from different species, suggesting that the available food resources were partitioned. The total annual prey consumption by the dominant fish species was estimated at 610 mg ash-free dry weight m - 3...|$|R
5000|$|Fish of the {{different}} <b>species</b> of <b>sprat</b> are found {{in various parts of}} the world including New Zealand, Australia, and parts of Europe. By far, the most highly studied location where the sprat, most commonly Sprattus sprattus, resides is the Baltic Sea, located in Northern Europe. The Baltic Sea provides the sprat with a highly diverse environment, with spatial and temporal potential allowing for successful reproduction. One of the most well-known locations in the Baltic Sea where they forage for their food is the Bornholm Basin, located in the southern portion of the Baltic Sea. Although the Baltic Sea has undergone several ecological changes during the last two decades, the sprat has dramatically increased in population. [...] One of the environmental changes that has occurred in the Baltic Sea since the 1980s includes a decrease in water salinity, due to a lack of inflow from the North Sea that contains high saline and oxygen content.|$|R
40|$|The major aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the influence of varying transport regimes on larval survival and subsequent recruitment of two major Baltic fish <b>species,</b> cod and <b>sprat.</b> A three-dimensional eddy resolving baroclinic model of the Baltic Sea in combination with a Lagrangian particle tracking technique has been used to model larval drift. New results on larval ecology and transport related survival rates were coupled to the transport model to develop an Individual-based Model of larval survival. A first set-up and utilization of this hydrodynamic/ trophodynamic IBM for cod larvae resulted in new insights in the cod recruitment process...|$|R
40|$|Availability and {{abundance}} of both migratory and resident species of tuna live baits in desired 	 quantity during thefishing {{season in the}} lagoons and adjacent waters coupled with their location, 	 capture and transportation determine {{the success or failure}} of pole and line tuna fishery. It is evident 	 that at Minicoy, capture and effective utilisation of different species of live baits has been in vogue 	 since more than a century but in the northern group of islands where mechanised pole and line fishery 	 is prevailing since 1963, the aimed live bait <b>species</b> are <b>sprats,</b> which are collected from shallow sand 	 flats from near or above coral reefs. The present study reveals the occurrence {{and abundance}} of other 	 suitable live baits with desired qualities in the deeper parts of the lagoonal ecosystem in the northern 	 islands, the utilization of which would reduce substantialfishing pressure on the local fragile baitfish 	 stock of sprat. 	 Fishery and population charaaeristics of seventeen species of tuna live baits collected from areas 	 of importance to tuna pole and linefishery in the Lakshadweep are presented and discussed. Evalua	 tion of different species is made based on their body form, colouration, behaviour pattern and sur	 vival in captivity. Habitat and seasonal distribution pattern and catch rate of different bait species 	 are communicated. Data needs for stock assessment of these species are emphasised and strategies 	 for the development and management of baitfish fishery in the Lakshadweep is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{fecundity}} and {{egg production}} of four species of small clupeoid, the anchovies Encrasicholina devisi, E. heterolobus, and the sprats Spratelloides delicatulus and S. lewisi, were examined at three {{sites in the}} Solomon Islands, tropical South Pacific. All species are multiple spawners and batch fecundity ranged between 500 and 1900 eggs per spawning, being significantly lower in the two <b>sprat</b> <b>species</b> than in the co-occurring anchovies. The fecundity of all species varied between sites, but not markedly between seasons. In Encrasicholina, fecundity {{was positively correlated with}} water temperature and zooplankton density, whereas in Spratelloides it was correlated with the hepatosomatic index. These results suggest that the fecundity of Encrasicho-lina is directly related to food intake, but Spratelloides probably depend on energy reserves in the liver for spawning. Egg volume differed between species and between sites for each species. Egg volume was inversely related to fecundity. Both species of Spratelloides had fewer, larger eggs than the similar-sized Encrasicholina species, which had much higher batch fecundity. This may be a consequence of lower or more predictable egg mortality that result...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMercury (Hg) in {{fish can}} present a {{potential}} risk to wildlife and human consumers. Mercury levels were determined in 12 fish species and 2 invertebrate species from the French {{coast of the}} Eastern English Channel collected in June and November 2012. Total mercury concentrations in the muscle tissues ranged between 0. 04 and 1. 63 Âµg g- 1 (d. w.). Dab and sandeel displayed a significant positive correlation between Hg concentrations and fish length. Seasonal differences in Hg concentrations were observed for dab and shrimp. The lesser weever showed significantly higher concentrations of Hg (0. 97 Â± 0. 34 Âµg g- 1 d. w.) than all other <b>species.</b> Gobies and <b>sprat,</b> which had the smallest size, showed significantly lower concentrations than herring, whiting, pout and sardine. Among the considered species, flatfish such as dab, flounder, plaice and sole displayed intermediate levels of Hg. In the present study, the fish age expressed as specimen length {{seems to be one}} of the major factors governing Hg contents in muscle tissues. Finally, mercury concentrations in commercial fish from the Eastern English Channel were below the levels fixed by the European Union for total mercury in edible parts of fish products...|$|R
40|$|Research Paper and Powerpoint PresentationMultispecies {{fisheries}} pose {{a considerable}} management difficulty {{with respect to}} quota allocation between species. The applicability is to single vessel and its individual quotas, {{as well as to}} the fleet as a whole. Negative externalities may be created if Total Allowable Catches (TACs) are not set in optimal proportions. That includes creation of unbalanced predator-prey relationships in the environment. This paper aims to develop a methodological framework for assessing the composition and distribution of TACs within heterogeneous fleet in a multispecies interaction system. The model is based on the individual technical efficiency dependent upon the vessel characteristics and associated flexibility with respect to utilizing quotas throughout the year. An empirical application is provided for the Polish Baltic Sea fleet, where the most valuable target species is cod. Multispecies interactions are incorporated as separate submodels for cod, herring, and <b>sprat</b> <b>species,</b> which are linked through predation. The regulatory body sets the annual quota based on the target fishing mortality varying between scenarios. The net present value of the fishery in each scenario is compared by simulating stock changes over time and paired with stock collapse probability estimates...|$|R
40|$|Small {{pelagic fish}} are {{the link between}} planktonic {{production}} and higher trophic levels. Competition for resources {{may play a role}} in the population dynamics of species, some of them probably standing out from the others due to greater feeding success. It is therefore important to understand the trophic niche of species overlapping both spatially and temporally. In this study, we have investigated the diet, prey preference, trophic niche breadth and diet overlap of the 8 major small pelagic <b>species</b> (anchovy, sardine, <b>sprat,</b> Atlantic and Mediterranean horse mackerel, bogue, Atlantic mackerel and Atlantic chub mackerel) inhabiting the Bay of Biscay. Results indicate that all fish feed mainly on calanoid copepods, incorporating larger prey like euphausiids and decapods to complete their diet. Differences in ingested prey diversity seem to be more limited by the available zooplankton at sea than by a specific diet preference by fish species, resulting in an overall high diet overlap, especially within clupeids but also between clupeids and other (larger) predator species. Consumption estimations for different prey groups could therefore determine whether such a large diet overlap between small pelagic fish, together with spatial co-occurrence, results in competition or enhances the effects of intraguild predation, which is important in terms of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management...|$|R
40|$|Global {{positioning}} system and time-depth recorders were deployed in combination {{to investigate the}} foraging behaviour of common murres Uria aalge breeding at Stora KarlsÃ¶ Island, Baltic Sea, during the chick-rearing period. In the pre-breeding period the main prey <b>species</b> of murres, <b>sprat</b> Sprattus sprattus, is targeted by commercial fisheries, likely reducing prey availability during the breeding season. Foraging trips typically consisted of a short flight followed by a period sitting on the sea surface (0. 39 Â± 0. 48 h), followed by several (5. 3 Â± 3. 8) diving bouts interspersed by flights and water surface activity. Following the final diving bout, murres returned directly to the colony. Overnight foraging trips lasted longer than daytime trips, and that result corresponded with greater diving activity and reduced dive depths around dawn and dusk, likely times of high prey accessibility. High outward flight groundspeeds (20. 0 Â± 2. 8 m s- 1) were aided by tailwinds, and lower inward flight groundspeeds (15. 1 Â± 2. 5 m s- 1) were impeded by headwinds. Flights following the wind direction may reflect a strategy to reduce crosswind drift. Foraging intensity was lower than reported by most other studies of murres, suggesting more abundant or aggregated prey...|$|R
40|$|The {{condition}} of the herring (Clupea harengus) in the Baltic Sea has decreased during the past 30 - 40 years. This decrease {{could be explained by}} different factors; (1) change in diet due to changes in zooplankton community, (2) changes in water temperature and salinity, (3) increasing nutrient inputs and (4) competition for food with other <b>species</b> such as <b>sprat</b> (Sprattus sprattus). In this study the change in condition was analysed using the Fultonâ€™s condition index, and by looking at age and sex of the fish as well as the season and locationthe fish was caught, the differences between these factors were presented. Data from the national Swedish contaminant monitoring programme where used from four locations in the Baltic Sea and two locations at the Swedish West coast. The data was analysed using multiple regressions in R Commander. The result show that the condition, and the temporal trends in condition value, varies at different locations, with higher condition values and increasing temporal trends at the Swedish West coast, compared to the Baltic Sea with lower condition values and where three of four locations show decreasing temporal trends. The condition varied between spring and autumn caught herring as well, while age and sex showed less significant differences...|$|R
40|$|Seabirds in the UK were {{generally}} more productive in 2005 than in 2004, when productivity for many species reached an all-time low. A presumed scarcity of sandeels in 2004, {{especially in the}} North Sea, led to widespread starvation of chicks in the Northern Isles and in many places along {{the east coast of}} Britain (there is also recent evidence that prey fish were of unusually low energy content in 2004 around SE Scotland). The likely knock-on effect for 2005 was that there were few larger sandeels present (those that hatched in 2004) and it is thought that feeding on these fish allow adults to attain breeding condition in spring. This food scarcity and a cold spring led to what was among the latest breeding seasons on record. However, a late appearance of young sandeels allowed some chicks to fledge, and alternative prey <b>species</b> (such as <b>sprat</b> and small haddock) were taken also. However, it is thought that some chicks starved in this late season, as sandeels become unavailable in late summer, when they settle on the seabed. Unusually, 2005 was a very poor breeding season for many species in NW Scotland, which was spared the food shortages of 2004 and previous years; preferred prey during chick rearing were scarce in this region in 2005...|$|R
40|$|AbstraktiSalmonid {{species that}} suffer from {{thiamine}} deficiency contain high fat concentrations. Thiamine deficiency occurs {{when they have}} an unbalanced diet principally consisting of one prey fish species, and when very few prey species overall are available in their feeding ground. The fat content of the main prey fish species of these salmonids is typically high, and can vary widely according to the season and also between areas, and evidently {{in relation to the}} feeding conditions. Thiamine deficiency has been linked to variations in the stock size of the main prey species, and some year classes of prey species tend to be most abundant. In most cases, a low egg thiamine concentration or high yolk-sac fry mortality has been associated with a high body weight or condition factor of salmon females. This indicates that salmon whose offspring display thiamine deficiency symptoms and mortality have access to copious amounts of food or/and food rich in energy. In the Baltic Sea, the thiamine concentration of both of the main prey <b>species</b> of salmon, <b>sprat</b> (Sprattus sprattus) and herring (Clupea harengus membras), is lowest in the youngest age groups (and also in the oldest herring, although these are not frequently included as salmon prey). Because the average fat content and energy density are greater in sprat than in herring, and greatest in the youngest sprat, the supply of thiamine per unit energy is lowest in a diet containing many young sprat. In the Baltic Sea, the thiamine content per unit fat and energy in the diet of salmon has been lowest during the years and in the areas where the recruitment and biomass of sprat have been high. Although the thiamine concentration of prey fish has been high enough for growth, the M 74 syndrome is associated with a limited supply of thiamine in proportion to the supply of fat; i. e., a low ratio of thiamine to energy. Thus, thiamine deficiency in salmon eggs results from an unbalanced diet abundant in fatty prey fish, from which the supply of thiamine is insufficient in proportion to the supply of energy and unsaturated fatty acids for salmon, which undergo a prespawning fasting period...|$|R
