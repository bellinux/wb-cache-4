40|$|Abstract: In this {{examination}} of communal violence (intrastate armed conflict between two non-state groups), {{we examine the}} relationship between one aspect of state institutional <b>strength—property</b> rights protection (PRP) – and inequality between social groups. Using a contest success function model, we build in an assumption that increasing PRP reduces the effectiveness of appropriative effort, generally increasing the equilibrium allocation of productive effort. In addition, PRP is modeled as potentially biased in favor of one group, creating inequality between social groups. Adding this to the model produces a non-monotonic result with respect to increasing PRP. Specifically, if a society has a moderate level of PRP but some degree of bias away from equity, an increase in PRP can result in either a decrease or an increase in total appropriative effort. Thus, simply increasing PRP without addressing equity issues can increase the level of conflict in the society. We argue that this has implications for international organizations that encourage state governments to focus on strengthening property rights institutions without addressing the more sensitive issue of inequality...|$|E
40|$|The {{generalization}} of the paraboloidal failure criterion for isotropic materials {{in order to}} cover anisotropic failure is presented in this paper. The resulting limit condition for anisotropic bodies is derived by a straightforward mathematical analysis based on physical grounds. The associated geometric interpretation of the failure condition in the principal stress space is an elliptic paraboloid having its axis of symmetry parallel to the hydrostatic axis and displaced from {{the origin of the}} coordinate system. All the geometric features of this failure surface depend on the degree of strength-anisotropy and <b>strength-properties</b> of the material. Then, given the appropriate strength parameters in three mutually orthogonal material directions, coaxial with the resulting principal stress coordinate system, one has a clear and well defined geometric picture of the failure surface for three-dimensional stress systems...|$|R
40|$|Silicon {{carbide fiber}} reinforced, silicon carbide matrix {{composites}} {{are some of}} the most advanced composite systems for high-temperature, high-stress applications in oxidizing environments. A basic area that needs to be understood for the purpose of material behavior modeling and optimization is the architectural, constituent, and mechanistic factors that contribute to non-linear stress-strain behavior. The mechanism that causes non-linear stress-strain in dense-matrix composites is the formation and propagation of bridged matrix cracks. In addition, the occurrence and propagation of matrix cracks controls the time-dependent <b>strength-properties</b> of these materials in oxidizing environments at elevated temperatures. A modal acoustic emission technique has been used to monitor and estimate the stress-dependent matrix cracking. Two different SiC matrix systems, chemical vapor infiltrated (CVI) and melt-infiltrated (MI), with two different SiC fiber reinforcement, Hi-Nicalon (trademark) and Sylramic (trademark) were compared. Even though the averages of the range where matrix cracking occurred for the composites varied by more than 0. 1 % in strain and almost 200 MPa in stress, the range or distribution for matrix cracking could be reduced to a narrow band of stress for CVI SiC and MI SiC composites if it were assumed that all matrix cracks emanate outside of the load-bearing fiber, interphase, CVI preform minicomposite. A simple relationship was determined to describe stress-dependent matrix cracking which can then be used to estimate the onset of large, bridged matrix cracks or for material behavior models...|$|R
