50|$|The {{use of a}} {{sharpened}} blade for the slaughtering {{of livestock}} has been practiced throughout history. Prior {{to the development of}} electric <b>stunning</b> <b>equipment,</b> some species were killed by simply striking them with a blunt instrument, sometimes followed by exsanguination with a knife.|$|E
5000|$|The firm of Accles & Shelvoke {{was formed}} in 1913 to {{commence}} the manufacture of cartridge-powered captive bolt <b>stunning</b> <b>equipment</b> to become a world leader in humane animal killing. This resulted from a history of manufacturing and engineering by the Shelvoke's which include: ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project was to {{introduce}} the application of suitable and efficient stunning methods to render livestock unconscious prior to slaughtering, with a view to minimizing post-harvest losses of meat and by-products. A total of 17 slaughter stations throughout the country were selected to participate in the project. Captive bolt pistols and humane killing cartridges were provided to all participating stations. Demonstrations were conducted on the utilization of the <b>stunning</b> <b>equipment,</b> and refresher training was provided on methods of minimizing post-harvest losses. Utilization of the stunning methods was quickly adopted at all selected slaughter stations. The new method was found to be safe, effective and significantly time-saving. The use of <b>stunning</b> <b>equipment</b> was found to greatly reduce the risk of injury to both livestock and slaughter station personnel. Reduced animal injury during slaughter resulted in a remarkable improvement in the quality of both meat and hides. Water should be provided for livestock at all slaughter stations. Handling facilities at all slaughter stations should be maintained in good condition, as this contributes to a more effective use of the <b>stunning</b> <b>equipment.</b> The Government should consider contacting donor agencies for the funding of slaughter station improvement and construction at designated trading centres...|$|E
40|$|There {{are five}} basic causes of animal welfare {{problems}} in slaughter plants: 1. Poorly designed or improper <b>stunning</b> and handling <b>equipment.</b> 2. Distractions which impede animal movement, such as sparkling reflections on a wet floor, air hissing, high-pitched noise or air drafts blowing down the race towards approaching animals. These distractions can ruin {{the performance of}} a well designed system and cause animals to become excited. When this happens, prodding will be required to make them move. 3. Lack of employee training and poor supervision of employees by management. 4. Poor maintenance of equipment and facilities, such as malfunctioning stunners or worn, slick, floors which cause animals to slip and fall. 5. Poor condition of animals arriving at the plant, such as cripples and sick animals. Another problem is pigs and cattle from excitable genetic lines which are more likely to become agitated during handling To maintain a high standard of welfare, all five problem areas must be addressed. A survey of 29 Canadian slaughter plants indicated that 27 % had excellent non-slip floors and 21 % had slick floors which would cause animals to slip. Twenty-four percent had high pitched motor noise or hissing air exhausts that caused animals to balk. Air drafts blowing down the race toward approaching animals were a problem in 9 % of the plants. Air drafts will often impede animal movement...|$|R
40|$|Electric {{stunning}} {{results in}} paroxysmal cerebral (epileptic) seizures with temporary loss of consciousness. Death is caused either by bleeding or cardiac arrest. During routine slaughter {{it is difficult}} to tell weather animals regain consciousness or sensation. In eighteen studies involving twelve slaughter houses, 1, 741 hogs were tested for eye reflexes and nose pinch reaction. Various stunning methods were used including asynchronous cardiac arrest stunning, head only stunning, and different frequencies of current. Testing was done using a modified tong pinching the hogÂ´s nose and or nasal septum (enervated by the trigeminal nerve) at 40 to 45 sec. after initiation of current flow. The different killing methods produced dissimilar results. This {{can be explained by the}} variations in stun-stick-times, and current form influence an the epileptic fit and the probability of cardiac arrest which is also frequency dependent. In addition to the nose pinch reaction test, 1, 266 animals were tested for eye reflexes. There was no regularity or correlation between the reactions of the two test, and the nose pinch test is more accurate and practical under actual slaughter house conditions. Although the nose pinch test probably does not indicate consciousness, a positive reaction may indicate the possibility of eventual return to consciousness. Therefore the goal of further investigation should be to determine which slaughter-method would lead to zero positive reactions to the nose pinch test. I. The investigated stunning method had been evaluated on the ground of recent results: 1.) Head-only stunning is considered inhumane if stun to stick time exceeds more than 21 sec [...] In all cases when sticking took place after this time more than fifty percent of slaughter hogs reacted to the nose pinch test. Even when slaughter houses with head only stunning were able to stick the hogs 15 - 21 sec. after current flow began, the number of positive reacting hogs was higher than after asynchronous cardiac arrest stunning. The results underline the importance of inducing cardiac fibrillation in hogs after the onset of (epileptic) seizures through the stun. 2.) In cardiac arrest stunning, when current frequencies were 300 to 500 Hz, there was reduced incidence of cardiac fibrillation. The results were similar to head only stunning. Without cardiac fibrillation, exact sticking in a lying position can be hindered and humane slaughter can not be assured. The results of this work confirms the results of other investigators concerning the shorter seizure-activity resulting from higher current frequencies. 3.) Asynchronous cardiac arrest stunning using frequency modulated current (head current: 500 ms from 10 KHz down to 100 Hz; heart- current: 500 ms from 10 KHz down to 80 Hz resulted in the lowest percentage of reacting pigs after stunning and sticking (nose-pinch: 4, 6 %; eye-reflexes: 0 % (N= 237)). 4.) When using asynchronous cardiac arrest stunning, it is essential to control also the heart-current frequency, strength, and duration; in order to induce fibrillation and assure humane slaughter with short stun to stick times. II. Veterinary supervision of humane slaughter should include following steps: 1.) Technical examination. The goal of the technical examination of <b>stunning</b> <b>equipment</b> should be to assure the proper function of the stunning device; including cables, electrodes and electric tongs. Continuous measurement of current can be a help (limited) in evaluating the stunning. Process evaluation can be used to analyse the conditions of pre-slaughter handling in the animals. 2.) Examination of the process of stunning and sticking, including physical evaluation of the anaesthetized animals. 2. 1) Evaluation of the process and efficacy of electric stunning (seizures) Exact placement of the electrodes and continuous current flow during the stunning time should be a priority. Evaluation should include the suitability of the restraining device to assure calm entrance and low stress restraint, so that the electrodes can be placed precisely. At the end of current-flow, all animals must show typical signs of grand mal seizures, i. e. tonic-clonic spasms, no regular breathing, no reflexes, no vocalization, no reaction to the bleeding-stick, nor head righting. (In case of cardiac fibrillation, clonic contractions may be slight or unnoticeable.) 2. 2) Assurance of maintaining the effect of stunning till death resulting from blood loss Measuring the stun to stick time and evaluate the workflow and - conditions is fundamental for humane slaughter. It must be assured that early sticking in the tonic state of epileptic fit is possible. Assessment of stunning and sticking could be assured by testing the nose pinch reaction or by a surface cut at nose tip or septum with a knife...|$|E
