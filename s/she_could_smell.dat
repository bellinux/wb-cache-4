500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1936, {{the crew of the}} Insect class gunboat HMS Gnat voted to get a ship's mascot. This was {{due in part to the}} {{competitive}} nature of the gunboats, with HMS Bee, Cicada, and Cricket already having mascots of their own. The Captain and the Chief Bosun's mate, Lt. Cmdr. J. Waldergrave and Chief Petty Officer Charles Jefferey, purchased Judy from the kennel and presented her to the crew. As her mother was known as Kelly of Sussex, Judy was listed as Judy of Sussex in her Royal Navy paperwork. It was hoped to train her as a gundog, but the men began to treat her like a pet instead, and several days after her arrival, Jefferey's log stated that [...] "our chances of making her a trained gundog are very small." [...] Her time spent on the streets of Shanghai was blamed for her lack of hunting instinct, the only time that she would point in the traditional manner was when <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> food.|$|E

60|$|One evening, as she was, {{according}} to her custom, rambling round about the courts and yards of the palace to see if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> any fresh meat, she heard, in a ground room, little Day crying, for his mamma was going to whip him, {{because he had been}} naughty; and she heard, at the same time, little Morning begging pardon for her brother.|$|E
6000|$|To Audrey {{everything}} in the room seemed to go round; yet all her senses were preternaturally acute, so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> distinctly <b>smell</b> the mud of the river at low tide. She said, with a shudder: ...|$|R
60|$|She {{kept her}} word, leaving {{the place in}} charge of the charwoman, who, when asked if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> stand the <b>smell,</b> replied, “What smell?” and who, when taken close to the cheeses and told to sniff hard, said <b>she</b> <b>could</b> detect a faint odour of melons. It was argued from this that little injury could result to the woman from the atmosphere, and she was left.|$|R
60|$|It was so like Insall, this book, in its whimsicality, in its {{feeling of}} space and freedom, in its hidden wisdom that {{gradually}} revealed itself as one thought it over before falling off to sleep! New England in the early summer! Here, beside the tender greens of the Ipswich downs was the sparkling cobalt of the sea, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>smell</b> its cool salt breath mingling with the warm odours of hay and the pungent scents of roadside flowers. Weathered grey cottages were scattered over the landscape, and dark copses of cedars, while oceanward the eye was caught by the gleam of a lighthouse or a lonely sail.|$|R
60|$|An early moon silvered {{the long}} slopes of wheat {{and made the}} alfalfa squares seem black. A cool, faint, sweet breeze fanned her cheek. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the {{fragrance}} of apples, of new-mown hay, and {{she could hear the}} low murmur of running water. A hound bayed off somewhere in the fields. There was no other sound. It was a quiet, beautiful, pastoral scene. But somehow it did not comfort Lenore.|$|E
60|$|Yvonne de Kernogan was {{certainly}} no coward, {{but at the}} loathsome contact of this infuriated and vengeful creature, she was overcome with such a hideous sense of fear that for the moment consciousness almost left her: not completely alas! for though she could not distinguish his face she could feel his hot breath upon her cheeks, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the nauseating odour of his damp clothes, and she could hear his hoarse mutterings as for {{the space of a}} few seconds he held her thus close to him in an embrace which to her was far more awesome than that of death.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't talk foolish. I know. Ain't I {{heard from}} a fellow dot live right here in town how you been acting wit' de boy? I know what you done! Walking wit' him in de country! Hiding in de woods wit' him! Yes and I guess you talk about {{religion}} in de woods! Sure! Women like you--you're worse dan street-walkers! Rich women like you, wit' fine husbands and no decent work to do--and me, look at my hands, look how I work, look at those hands!

60|$|Then {{a horrible}} stench struck Carley {{almost like a}} blow in the face, and before her {{confused}} sight {{there appeared to be}} drifting smoke and active men and running sheep, all against a background of mud. But at first it was the odor that caused Carley to close her eyes and press her knees hard against the upper log to keep from reeling. Never in her life had such a sickening nausea assailed her. It appeared to attack her whole body. The forerunning qualm of seasickness was as nothing to this. Carley gave a gasp, pinched her nose between her fingers so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>smell,</b> and opened her eyes.|$|R
