30|$|This {{trial was}} {{designed}} to assess the role of DAA and corticosteroids in adult septic shock. Evaluation of DAA was terminated early owing to its {{withdrawal from the market}} by Lilly [34]. We found no evidence for any benefit from DAA [8]. Owing to the lack of interaction between DAA and corticosteroids, the trial continued to allow evaluation of corticosteroids. The study was <b>suspended</b> on <b>request</b> of DSMB to check safety issues. The two trial suspensions had no impact on its conduct, except delaying its completion. There were several amendments to the protocol mainly related to DAA. In particular, after DAA withdrawal from the market, corresponding exclusion criteria were removed and trial design changed for a two-parallel groups’ design. This amendment accelerated the recruitment rate into the trial. Then, we will explore any interaction between this change in the protocol and response to corticosteroids.|$|R

40|$|As {{defined by}} IEEE 802. 15. 6 standard, channel sharing is a {{potential}} method to coordinate inter-network interference among Medical Body Area Networks (MBANs) that are close to one another. However, channel sharing opens up new vulnerabilities as selfish MBANs may manipulate their online channel requests to gain unfair advantage over others. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a truthful online channel sharing algorithm and a companion protocol that allocates channel efficiently and truthfully by punishing MBANs for misreporting their channel request parameters such as time, duration and bid for the channel. We first present an online channel sharing scheme for unit-length channel requests and prove that it is truthful. We then generalize our model to settings with variable-length channel requests, where we propose a critical value based channel pricing and preemption scheme. A bid adjustment procedure prevents unbeneficial preemption by artificially raising the ongoing winner’s bid controlled by a penalty factor λ. Our scheme can efficiently detect selfish behaviors by monitoring a trust parameter α of each MBAN and punish MBANs from cheating by <b>suspending</b> their <b>requests.</b> Our extensive simulation results show our scheme can achieve a total profit {{that is more than}} 85 % of the offline optimum method in the typical MBAN settings. 19 page(s...|$|R

50|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{above and beyond}} the call of duty. On November 8, 1942, near Port Lyautey, French Morocco, Col. Craw volunteered to accompany the leading wave of assault boats to the shore and pass through the enemy lines to locate the French commander with a view to <b>suspending</b> hostilities. This <b>request</b> was first refused as being too dangerous but upon the officer's insistence that he was qualified to undertake and accomplish the mission he was allowed to go. Encountering heavy fire while in the landing boat and unable to dock in the river because of shell fire from shore batteries, Col. Craw, accompanied by 1 officer and 1 soldier, succeeded in landing on the beach at Mehdia Plage under constant low-level strafing from 3 enemy planes. Riding in a bantam truck toward French headquarters, progress of the party was hindered by fire from our own naval guns. Nearing Port Lyautey, Col. Craw was instantly killed by a sustained burst of machinegun fire at pointblank range from a concealed position near the road.|$|R

40|$|Summary: Several {{randomized}} controlled trials have raised alarming {{concerns about the}} safety of hydroxyethyl starches (HES) for the hemodynamic stabilization of critically ill patients. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that the use of HES in patients treated in an intensive care unit was associated with an increased occurrence of serious adverse events, including a higher incidence of renal injury or failure, a higher need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), and (in one study) increased mortality. HES solutions are also widely used in the perioperative period, although high-level evidence on both the efficacy and safety of HES in patients undergoing surgery is sparse. It is unknown to which extent the concerning findings in critically ill patients can be extrapolated to the perioperative setting, where a variety of distinct patient populations is encountered. However, caution and an increased awareness for possible adverse effects of HES solutions in the perioperative setting are warranted. In 2013, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) con-cluded that the benefits of HES solutions no longer outweigh their risks, and therefore recommended that the marketing authorizations for these medicines be <b>suspended</b> (1). Upon <b>request</b> of some of the marketing-authorization holders (MAH), the EMA re-analyzed its recommendation. After a thorough review of the available data, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluded, on November 11 th, that the increased risk of mortality and RRT or renal failure {{associated with the use of}} hydroxyethyl starch con taining medicinal products outweighs their limited clinical benefits in the approved indications, and in any patient population. In June 2013, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration also communicated a serious warning with respect to the use of HES (2). The present (non-systematic) review summarizes the evidence upon which these remarkable recommendations are based. Moreover, current guidelines on the use of HES are quoted...|$|R
