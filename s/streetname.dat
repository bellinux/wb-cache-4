PO box {{addresses}} have postal codes which {{differ from those}} used for street addresses. Some areas do not have street names.

One {{of the first}} families of Indian origin was the Bhyat family, whose contribution to the city's history was marked by the renaming of a major <b>streetname</b> to Fatima Bhayat Street in honour of Fatima Bhyat who arrived in Rustenburg {{with her husband in}} 1877.|$|E

50|$|The 17th century English slang word skelder, a noun and verb which {{referred}} to a professional beggar, especially one who falsely pretended to be a wounded former soldier to gain sympathy; more generally, {{it could be used}} for a swindler or cheat. An early recorded use is by Ben Jonson, from his play Poetaster, written in 1601: 'An honest decayed commander, cannot skelder, cheat, nor be seene in a bawdie house.' In an older military connection, the term skelder seems to have been used in early Medieval England to mean 'shield-maker' (Old Norse 'skjoldur'?), the supposed derivation of the <b>streetname</b> Skeldergate in the city of York.|$|E
5000|$|As is {{the custom}} in Hungary (as well as {{southern}} Germany), Danube Swabians often put the surname first, especially when writing, for example Butscher Jakob (see photo of memorial). Danube Swabian villages {{tend to have}} relatively few family names as the villagers stem from only a few families, but usually the same family name {{does not appear in}} {{more than a couple of}} villages, meaning that there are many Danube Swabian family names. The names come from throughout southern Germany, from assimilated Hungarians, and occasionally from Balkan and Italian origins. There are usually no middle names, but often double first names, if a distinction can be made. The variety of first names is few, since children were usually named after grandparents or godparents. Popular names for women include: Anna, Barbara, Christina, Elisabeth, Katharina, Magdalena, Maria, Sophia, Theresia, and many two-name combinations thereof. Popular names for men include: Adam, Anton, Christian, Franz, Friedrich, Georg, Gottfried, Heinrich, Jakob, Johann, Konrad, Ludwig, Mathias, Michael, Nikolaus, Peter, Philipp (or Filipp), and Stefan (or Stephan). With so few names in villages, other modifiers or nicknames were almost always used to distinguish people. The modifiers were often size related (e.g., [...] "Kleinjohann" [...] or [...] "Little Johann"), occupation related ("Tischler Stefan" [...] or the [...] "carpenter Stefan"), or location related (usually by prefixing the <b>streetname).</b>|$|E

The main part of area is built along {{both sides of the}} A6 road heading up the hill in the direction of Carlisle. The road is <b>streetnamed</b> as Stricklandgate and Scotland Road but on maps dating before the mid-19th century was just marked as Town Head.|$|R
5000|$|The name Eindhoven {{derives from}} the {{contraction}} of the regional words eind (meaning [...] "last" [...] or [...] "end") and hove (or hoeve, a section of some 14 hectares of land). Toponymically, eind occurs commonly as a prefix and postfix in local place- and <b>streetnames.</b> A [...] "hove" [...] comprised a parcel of land which a local lord might lease to private persons (such as farmers). Given that a string of such parcels existed around Woensel, the name Eindhoven may have originated with the meaning [...] "last hoves on the land of Woensel".|$|R
50|$|Winschoten was {{the capital}} of the Oldambt district, in a fertile {{agricultural}} region. Winschoten received city rights in 1825. It was the last town in the Netherlands to be granted such rights and {{it was more of a}} symbolic gesture. The town flag has three horizontal stripes of blue and white, in ratio 1:3:1, on the white stripe is a red outline plan of a fortress with nine embattlements. It was adopted 23 May 1973 by municipal resolution. The coat of arms is an image of Saint Vitus, whose name can also be recognized in lots of <b>streetnames,</b> schoolnames names of clubs, etc.|$|R
40|$|What {{does it mean}} to {{constitute}} the landscape in language? The author addresses the complications of navigating a colonial landscape such as 19 th-century Singapore, and the complex web of mobilities emerging from multiple knowledges. Despite the existence of official <b>streetnames,</b> different racial groups possessed different names and references for the very same streets—even within the same language. How then can we ever know of a place if it is inscribed by the interplay of cultural and linguistic experiences that constitute specific worlds? Drawing from Wittgenstein and Derrida, the author attempts to engage with the linguistic assumptions governing mobility in the multilayered colonial space of Singapore in which the same street is always a different street—and experienced very differently. ...|$|R
50|$|The Rotterdam Zoo {{moved to}} its new {{location}} in the Blijdorp district prior to the bombing of Rotterdam in World War II, which destroyed {{most of the city}} centre. The original zoo had been heavily damaged in a bombing two days prior to the Blitz but it had not been touched by the main bombardment on May 10, 1940. Some <b>streetnames,</b> such as Diergaardesingel (Zoolane), still recall the old zoo. Blijdorp was rebuilt slightly to the north, where it opened to the public in its current location on December 7, 1940. The new zoo was designed by Dutch architect Sybold van Ravesteyn, who designed the central railway station in Rotterdam, as well. In 2001, Blijdorp became almost twice as large when it opened a new western part, which includes the aquarium Oceanium. In 2007, the zoo was declared a rijksmonument.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an attempt to}} improve the coverage of an existing name pronunciation dictionary by modelling variation in spelling. This {{is done by the}} derivation of string rewrite rules which operate on out-of-vocabulary words to map them to in-vocabulary words. These string rewrite rules are derived automatically, and are “pronunciation-neutral” {{in the sense that the}} mappings they perform on the existing dictionary do not result in a change of pronunciation. The approach is data-driven, and can be used online to make predictions for some (not all) OOV words, or offline to add significant numbers of new pronunciations to existing dictionaries. Offline the approach has been used to increase dictionary coverage for four domain-based dictionaries for forenames, surnames, <b>streetnames</b> and placenames. For surnames, a model trained on a 23, 000 -entry dictionary was subsequently able to add 5, 000 new entries, improving both type coverage and token coverage of the dictionaries by about 1 %. An informal evaluation suggests that the suggested pronunciations are good in 80 % of cases. 1...|$|R
