5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that given its proportion of the waste stream and the lack of distinct collections, food waste is not currently being targeted appropriately. However proposals by the European Union, which would require local authorities to provide <b>separate</b> <b>collection</b> of food and garden waste, have been met with opposition; critics of the proposals argue that local authorities understand the specific needs of the areas they serve, and that they should decide waste policy. Advocates of the proposals say that it will ensure energy is not wasted in sorting biodegradable waste from other materials.|$|E

40|$|Plabic graphs are {{interesting}} combinatorial objects {{used to study}} the totally nonnegative Grassmannian. Faces of plabic graphs are labeled by $k$-element sets of positive integers, {{and a collection of}} such $k$-element sets are the face labels of a plabic graph if that collection forms a maximal weakly <b>separated</b> <b>collection.</b> There are moves that one can apply to plabic graphs, and thus to maximal weakly <b>separated</b> <b>collections,</b> analogous to mutations of seeds in cluster algebras. In this short note, we show that if two maximal weakly <b>separated</b> <b>collections</b> can be mutated from one to another, then one can do so while freezing the face labels they have in common.

25|$|At {{one end of}} the {{spectrum}} is mixed waste collection, in which all recyclates are collected mixed in {{with the rest of the}} waste, and the desired material is then sorted out and cleaned at a central sorting facility. This results in a large amount of recyclable waste, paper especially, being too soiled to reprocess, but has advantages as well: the city need not pay for a <b>separate</b> <b>collection</b> of recyclates and no public education is needed. Any changes to which materials are recyclable is easy to accommodate as all sorting happens in a central location.|$|E

2500|$|Condensers {{are often}} used in reflux, where the hot solvent vapors of a liquid being heated are cooled and allowed to drip back.

Condensers are used in distillation to cool the hot vapors, condensing them into liquid for <b>separate</b> <b>collection.</b> For fractional distillation, an air or Vigreux condenser is usually used to slow {{the rate at which}} the hot vapors rise, giving a better separation between the different components in the distillate. For microscale distillation, the apparatus includes the [...] "pot", and the condenser fused into one-piece, which reduces the hold-up volume, and obviates the need for ground glass joints preventing contamination by grease and precluding leaks.|$|E

2500|$|The {{collections}} of the Danish National Gallery originate in the Art Chamber (...) of the Danish monarchs. When the German Gerhard Morell became Keeper of Frederick V's Art Chamber about 1750, he suggested that the king create a <b>separate</b> <b>collection</b> of paintings. To ensure that the collection was not inferior {{to those of other}} European royal houses and local counts, the king made large-scale purchases of Italian, Netherlandish and German paintings. The collection became particularly well provided with Flemish and Dutch art. The most important purchase during Morell's term as keeper was Christ as the Suffering Redeemer by Andrea Mantegna. 'Det Kongelige Billedgalleri' (Royal Art Gallery) was housed in Christiansborg Palace until 1884 when the castle burnt down. It was not until the opening of the museum in 1896 that the art had a new home.|$|E
2500|$|A urine-diverting dry toilet (UDDT) {{is a type}} of dry toilet with urine {{diversion}} {{that can}} be used to provide safe, affordable sanitation in a variety of contexts worldwide. Through the <b>separate</b> <b>collection</b> of feces and urine without any flush water, many advantages can be realized, such as odor-free operation and pathogen reduction by drying. While dried feces and urine harvested from UDDTs can be and routinely are used in agriculture (respectively, as a soil amender and nutrient-rich fertilizer—this practice being known as reuse of excreta in agriculture), many UDDTs installations do not make use of any sort of recovery scheme. The UDDT is an example of a technology {{that can be used to}} achieve a sustainable sanitation system. This dry excreta management system (or [...] "dry sanitation" [...] system) is an alternative to pit latrines and flush toilets, especially where water is scarce, a connection to a sewer system and centralized wastewater treatment plant is not feasible or desired, fertilizer and soil conditioner are needed for agriculture, or groundwater pollution should be minimized.|$|E

60|$|The whole matter was, {{after the}} Restoration, {{discovered}} {{to be the}} trick {{of one of their}} own party, who had attended the Commissioners as a clerk, under the name of Giles Sharp. This man, whose real name was Joseph Collins of Oxford, called Funny Joe, was a concealed loyalist, and well acquainted with the old mansion of Woodstock, where he had been brought up before the Civil War. Being a bold, active spirited man, Joe availed himself of his local knowledge of trap-doors and private passages so as to favour the tricks which he played off upon his masters by aid of his fellow-domestics. The Commissioners' personal reliance on him made his task the more easy, and it was all along remarked that trusty Giles Sharp saw the most extraordinary sights and visions among the whole party. The unearthly terrors experienced by the Commissioners are detailed with due gravity by Sinclair, and also, I think, by Dr. Plott. But although the detection or explanation of the real history of the Woodstock demons has also been published, and I have myself seen it, I have at this time forgotten whether it exists in a <b>separate</b> <b>collection,</b> or where it is to be looked for.|$|E
