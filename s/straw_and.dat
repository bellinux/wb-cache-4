5|$|According to the International Energy Agency, {{cellulosic}} ethanol biorefineries {{could allow}} biofuels {{to play a}} much bigger role in the future than {{organizations such as the}} IEA previously thought. Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> rice straw), wood waste, and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in many regions.|$|E

40|$|Rice straw (Oryza sativa L.) pulp {{was treated}} using a {{high-pressure}} homogenizer to make fibril and fibril aggregates. The rice <b>straw</b> fibril <b>and</b> fibril aggregate material {{was used as}} reinforcement in a rice <b>straw</b> fibril <b>and</b> fibril aggregates/polyvinyl alcohol nanocomposite that was prepared by casting film under air-dry and freezing–thawing conditions, respectively. The material’s tensile strength was increased by adding the rice <b>straw</b> fibril <b>and</b> fibril aggregates material into the polyvinyl alcohol matrix. The mechanical properties were higher in rice <b>straw</b> fibril <b>and</b> fibril aggregates/polyvinyl alcohol nano-composites cast under freezing–thawing conditions than those casting under air-drying conditions. Dynamic thermo-mechanical analysis testing showed that the storage modulus (E 0) of the rice <b>straw</b> fibril <b>and</b> fibril aggregates/polyvinyl alcohol nanocomposites was {{higher than that of}} polyvinyl alcohol alone when 2 % rice <b>straw</b> fibril <b>and</b> fibril aggregates material was added into the polyvinyl alcohol matrix. The glass transition temperature (Tg) rose in neat polyvinyl alcohol <b>and</b> rice <b>straw</b> fibril <b>and</b> fibril aggregates/polyvinyl alcohol nanocomposites cast under freezing–thawing conditions. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis revealed that the melting temperature (Tm), melting enthalpy (HC) and crystallinity (XC) in rice <b>straw</b> fibril <b>and</b> fibril aggregates/polyvinyl alcohol nanocomposites increased to higher values compared to those in neat polyvinyl alcohol when cast under the two conditions. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the polymer matrixes were stabilized against thermal decomposition by the addition of rice <b>straw</b> fibril <b>and</b> fibril aggregates. The shift of the –OH stretching peak of rice <b>straw</b> fibril <b>and</b> fibril aggregates/polyvinyl alcohol nanocompo-sites in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra indicated a good compatibility between rice <b>straw</b> fibril <b>and</b> fibril aggregates and the polyvinyl alcohol matrix in nanocomposites...|$|R
5|$|Wood {{was used}} for beams, and for lintels, even in masonry structures. Throughout Maya history, common huts and some temples {{continued}} to be built from wooden poles and thatch. Adobe was also applied; this consisted of mud strengthened with <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> was applied as a coating over the woven-stick walls of huts. Like wood and thatch, adobe was used throughout Maya history, even after the development of masonry structures. In the southern Maya area, adobe was employed in monumental architecture when no suitable stone was locally available.|$|E

Gaston arrives to take Belle back but Rumpelstiltskin turns him into a rose and presents it to her as a gift. When asked about Gaston, Belle says that it was an arranged marriage, not one of love. She left him because she wanted to be heroic and there are not many chances for women to be heroic. Rumpelstiltskin asks Belle to go into town to buy more <b>straw,</b> <b>and</b> she cannot believe he trusts her to come back. Rumpelstiltskin says he does not expect to see her again.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs {{are used}} in the cuisine of Cuzco, Peru, in dishes such as cuy al horno, baked guinea pig. The {{traditional}} Andean stove, known as a qoncha or a fogón, is made from mud and clay reinforced with <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> hair from animals such as guinea pigs. In Peru, there are at any time 20 million domestic guinea pigs, which annually produce 64 million edible carcasses. This animal is an excellent food source since the flesh is 19% protein. In the United States, mostly squirrels, but also muskrats, porcupines, and ground hogs are eaten by humans. The Navajo people ate prairie dog baked in mud, while the Paiute ate gophers, squirrels, and rats.|$|E

5|$|The {{methods used}} to {{cultivate}} crops are described in Book XVIII. He praises Cato the Elder and his work De Agri Cultura, which he uses as a primary source. Pliny's work includes discussion of all known cultivated crops and vegetables, as well as herbs and remedies derived from them. He describes machines used in cultivation and processing the crops. For example, he describes a simple mechanical reaper that cut the ears of wheat and barley without the <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> was pushed by oxen (Book XVIII, chapter 72). It is depicted on a bas-relief found at Trier from the later Roman period. He also describes how grain is ground using a pestle, a hand-mill, or a mill driven by water wheels, as found in Roman water mills across the Empire.|$|E
5|$|A typical early 19th-century casual ward was {{a single}} large room {{furnished}} {{with some kind of}} bedding and perhaps a bucket {{in the middle of the}} floor for sanitation. The bedding on offer could be very basic: the Poor Law authorities in Richmond in the mid-1840s provided only <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> rags, although beds were available for the sick. In return for their night's accommodation vagrants might be expected to undertake a certain amount of work before leaving the next day, such as at Guisborough, where men were required to break stones for three hours and women to pick oakum, two hours before breakfast and one after. Until the passage of the Casual Poor Act 1882 vagrants could discharge themselves before 11 am on the day following their admission, but from 1883 onwards they were required to be detained until 9 am on the second day. Those who were admitted to the workhouse again within one month were required to be detained until the fourth day after their admission.|$|E
5|$|An {{encounter}} battle {{developed as}} 3 RAR carried out an aggressive quick attack {{off the line}} of march from the road, with American tanks in support. With fire support from mortars and artillery unavailable due {{to the location of}} US 3/187 RCT being unknown, the Australian attack succeeded nonetheless, and the North Koreans were forced to withdraw from the high ground having suffered heavy casualties. Meanwhile, 3 RAR's tactical headquarters came under attack and was forced to fight off a group of North Koreans. Having been forced off the high ground, the North Koreans were now caught between the advancing Australians and the American paratroopers to the north. Attacking the North Koreans from the rear, 3 RAR subsequently relieved the American paratroopers, with the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade linked up with them by 11:00. Following three hours of fighting the battle was largely over by midday; however, many of the North Koreans that had been unable to escape continued to refuse to surrender, hiding or feigning death until individually flushed out. The Australians then proceeded to sweep the area, kicking over stacks of <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> shooting the North Korean soldiers they found hiding in them as they attempted to flee. Caught between the American paratroopers and the British and Australians, the North Korean 239th Regiment was practically destroyed. In their first major battle in Korea the Australians had distinguished themselves, and the battalion was later praised for its performance.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} the Grays returned, and Ann became {{suspicious}} when Burke would not let her approach a bed where she had left her stockings. When they were left {{alone in the house}} in the early evening, the Grays searched the <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> found Docherty's body, showing blood and saliva on the face. On their way to alert the police, they ran into McDougal who tried to bribe them with an offer of £10 a week; they refused. While the Grays reported the murder to the police, Burke and Hare removed the body and took it to Knox's surgery. The police search located Docherty's bloodstained clothing hidden under the bed. Burke and his wife gave different times for Docherty's departure from the house, which raised enough suspicion for the police to take them in for questioning. Early the following morning the police went to Knox's dissecting-rooms where they found Docherty's body; James Gray identified her as the woman he had seen with Burke and Hare. Hare and his wife were arrested that day, as was Broggan; all denied any knowledge of the events.|$|E
5|$|As Jerry is {{sleeping}} on the plane he dreams of returning to his apartment only to find several FBI agents there interrogating Kramer, who apparently has ratted out Jerry. When Jerry protests that {{he had nothing to}} do with it, they reveal that the Russian was an undercover FBI agent. Jerry tries to flee only to be gunned down by the agents. This jolts him awake. He finds his show is canceled due to bad weather, and George picks up Jerry at the airport. Jerry is initially amazed that George is perfectly willing, even anxious to drive Jerry home. When he informs George they cannot go back to his apartment because of the baby shower, George insists and Jerry discovers that George is wearing the red shirt and is just using the favor as a chance to encounter Leslie at the baby shower. Meanwhile, Kramer and the two Russians crash the shower to install cable television, start to eat all the food and get into a heated argument. When George and Jerry arrive, George's plan proves unsuccessful, as he cannot muster the courage confront Leslie and instead awkwardly tries to curry her favor. He is interrupted when one of the other party guests (Margaret Reed as Mary) suddenly confronts Jerry because he never called her back after a date. This unpleasant scene is the final <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> the guests leave hurriedly. On the way out of the bathroom the angry woman bumps Leslie and her dessert into George, adding a chocolate cake stain to the Bosco stain already on the shirt. Jerry changes his mind about the cable hook-up, but is still charged with a large amount of money. When he refuses to pay, the Russians break the picture tube of his television set.|$|E
5|$|Unable to move north, the North Koreans {{attempted}} to breakout {{across the open}} rice fields to the west, through {{the gap between the}} 27th British Commonwealth Brigade and US 187 RCT. The North Koreans again suffered heavy casualties, with many cut down by tank and rifle fire from C Company, 3 RAR. Some of the survivors took refuge among a number of haystacks and rice stooks in front of 9 Platoon, from where they engaged the Australians with sniper fire. Others fled east, escaping to the higher ground where they dispersed. D Company, 3 RAR was subsequently ordered to clear pockets of resistance remaining within the battalion position. Meanwhile, the Middlesex battalion passed through the Australians and, with the tanks, linked up with US 187 RCT at 11:00. Following three hours of fighting the battle was largely over by midday; however, many of the North Koreans that had been unable to escape continued to refuse to surrender, hiding or feigning death until individually flushed out. After clearing their objectives 7 and 8 Platoon had moved forward towards 9 Platoon, which then clashed with a number of North Korean stragglers in the paddy fields. C Company, 3 RAR subsequently deployed in an extended line and a substantial action soon developed. In a scene Coad later likened to driving snipe, the Australians subsequently proceeded to sweep the area, kicking over stacks of <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> shooting the North Korean soldiers they found hiding in them as they {{attempted to}} flee. For his leadership Butler was subsequently awarded the US Silver Star, while Private John Cousins received the US Bronze Star {{for his role in the}} action.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Corn <b>straw</b> biochar <b>and</b> peanut shell biochar {{were used}} as an adsorbent, duly {{affected}} by the condition of diverse concentrations of ammonium nitrogen, response times, the pH and temperature levels. The study focused on the adsorption characteristics of ammonium nitrogen by corn <b>straw</b> biochar <b>and</b> peanut shell biochar, which demonstrated that the adsorption rate of ammonium nitrogen by corn <b>straw</b> biochar <b>and</b> peanut shell biochar is higher in the initial response. The adsorption quantity rises quickly and attains equilibrium after 4 hours. The adsorbance, once stable {{was found to be}} 753. 29 mg/kg for corn <b>straw</b> biochar <b>and</b> 1003. 70 mg/kg for peanut shell biochar. The adsorption characteristics of ammonium nitrogen by corn <b>straw</b> biochar <b>and</b> peanut shell biochar are more fitted to the Freundlich equation (Freundlich adsorption isotherm), within the limits of pH 5 to 9. The adsorption of ammonium nitrogen by corn <b>straw</b> biochar <b>and</b> peanut shell biochar increased with the increase in the pH and temperature. The adsorption effectiveness of peanut shell biochar is better than corn straw biochar...|$|R
