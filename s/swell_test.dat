40|$|The {{formation}} of ettringite {{has been defined}} as a major failure mechanism of lime stabilised cohesive soils. It can result in both disruptive volumetric changes and loss of mechanical strength. The mechanisms of its formation and the role it plays in deleterious processes are complex.

40|$|Lime and/or cement stabilised {{fine-grained}} soils {{have been}} successfully used {{in the construction industry}} throughout the UK since the early 1970 ’s. Soil stabilisation has several economic, technical and environmental advantages. Although the vast majority of roads built upon stabilised soil foundations have resulted in durable pavements, a few case studies exist where expansive reactions have locally occurred, resulting in the requirement for extensive remedial works. Two high profile failures attributed to the expansion of stabilised capping layers were the M 40 Banbury IV contract and the more recently constructed A 10 Wadesmill Bypass. Both were Department for Transport (DfT) contracts in which the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) <b>swell</b> <b>test</b> was used as part of the quality control and/or investigation procedure. The Highways Agency (HA) and the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) are still recommending the use of the CBR <b>swell</b> <b>test</b> as a means of determining a soils suitability for use within the stabilised process. This thesis was undertaken at Nottingham University as part of an MPhil study programme conducted by Craig Notman. The main aspect of the research was to review the CBR <b>swell</b> <b>test</b> (B. S. 1924 - 2 : 1990) to determine its suitability as an appropriate laboratory test for assessing a soils volumetric change (as it is, and has been, previously recommended by the HA and the TRL). The research focuses on the volumetric stability of stabilised soils, which require assessment under laboratory conditions. Various laboratory standards for determining the volumetric stability of stabilised soils were selected for comparative purposes. They included the CBR <b>swell</b> <b>test</b> (BS 1924 - 2 : 1990), the European accelerated swelling test (BS EN 13286 - 49 : 2004) and the loss of strength upon immersion test Manual of Contract Documents for Highways Works, Volume 1 (MCHW 1) Series 800 Clause 880. 4. When comparing the pass/fail criteria from the three test methods, all three resulted in differing recommendations. The research findings indicate that the pass/fail criterion of the CBR <b>swell</b> <b>test</b> (recommended by the HA 74 / 00) is less stringent than the European accelerated <b>swell</b> <b>test</b> for the same material. That is, when assessing a material’s suitability for stabilisation as a Capping material (foundation class 1 : IAN 73), the CBR <b>swell</b> <b>test</b> is more likely to deem a material suitable than if the European accelerated <b>swell</b> <b>test</b> was used. The loss of strength on immersion test is the most difficult pass/fail criterion to satisfy. The author concludes that the BS 1924 - 1990 CBR <b>swell</b> <b>test</b> is an inappropriate test to be used as the sole determinant for the volumetric stability of stabilised soils (as recommended by TRL 505), and that further research is required to develop appropriate guidance before this test is used again for assessing the volumetric stability of stabilised soils...|$|E

40|$|Several {{million tons}} of Chromite Ore Processing Residue (COPR) were {{deposited}} at two sites in New Jersey and Maryland, USA, and over time they exhibited extensive heaving phenomena. Ettringite, a needle-shaped mineral and an expansive mineral commonly recognized in the literature concerning cement- and soil, has been identified extensively in numerous COPR samples collected from these sites. It was therefore believed that ettringite formation and its crystal growth are strongly associated with COPR heaving. We investigated the correlation between ettringite and the heaving phenomena in COPR materials that contained no initial ettringite. Two identical COPR samples were exposed to a 4 % w/w sulfate solution (25 °C, 50 °C) in a confined <b>swell</b> <b>test</b> apparatus. Both <b>swell</b> <b>test</b> samples were analyzed by means of X-ray powder diffraction.

40|$|Soil {{stabilisation}} is {{a useful}} civil engineering technique that enables the insitu material {{to be used as}} part of an engineered structure. Stabilised layers are used in road foundation; working platforms and for slope stabilisation and sea defences. Chemical stabilisation involves the use of a hydraulic binder (and sometimes additional pozzolans). Commonly, quicklime (CaO) or slaked-lime (Ca(OH) 2) is used. On mixing into the ground, this reacts with the aluminosilicates of the clay fraction, reducing its overall water content and plasticity. Further additions increase the insitu pH. Above pH 10. 4, the aluminosilicates become soluble in the pore solution. They are then able to fonn a range of insoluble mineral hydrates which constitute a cementitious matrix. This results in both an increase in mechanical strength and a decrease in dimensional stability. If the insitu material contains sulfur bearing mineralogies, these can react with the hydraulic binder and the aluminosilicates to form expansive minerals. If this occurs after the initial setting and hardening of the stabilised layer has occurred, it can lead to severe dimensional instability and mechanical weakening. This is termed sulfate heave and the principal agent of this heave is a hydrous calcium sulfoaluminate hydrate, ettringite (AFt). The fundamental processes of ettringite formation and associated expansion are little understood in stabilised soils. This research used a range of artificial sulfate [...] bearing, lime stabilised blended soil samples subject to two immersion tests used for material suitability assessment in the UK. The physicochemical response (in terms of dimensional heave and mechanical weakening) was assessed as a function of soil composition and the environmental conditions imposed by the two immersion tests. The fundamental microstructure and phase composition was characterised using a range of analytical techniques (XRD, SEMEDX, dTGA). The relationship between the observed macro-physical properties and underlying chemical environment and microstructure was explored. Key findings include that the mechanism of ettringite formation and expansion was found to be governed by the fundamental structure of the bulk clay. This explained the greater swell response of the kaolin based soils compared to those of the montmorillonite. The SEM-EDX analysis identified a primitive, Ca-rich, AFt phase termed 'ball ettringite', in stabilised soils. This has only relatively recently been reported in studies of cement mortars. Also, small amounts of sulfate in the bulk soil actually increase soil strength. It was suggested that the preferential formation of monosulfate (AFm) {{plays an important role in}} this mechanism. The introduction of water to the pore solution is key to the j formation of ettringite. This was evidenced by X-Ray CT of the damage caused to soil specimens on immersion, as well as low angle XRD studies of the principal AFt peak. Based on the limited testng undertaken one of the immersion tests (European accelerated volumetic <b>swell</b> <b>test,</b> EN 13286 - 49), appears to be more onerous than the other (UK CBR linear <b>swell</b> <b>test,</b> B 51924 - 2).

The geotechnical behaviour of expansive clay soils is investigated by looking into the geomorphologic, geological and climatic conditions and mineralogical composition of the soils in the study area. The geotechnical results are linked with the performance of the foundation as well as structures. Two sites, representative of known problem-areas in Kibaha were selected for geotechnical tests.

The collected samples were submitted to soil laboratories at KTH and DIT for mineralogical composition tests, natural water content, density, Atterberg limits and <b>swell</b> <b>tests</b> (free <b>swell</b> and swelling pressure). The results of this investigation indicate that soil in Kibaha contains clay (31 %), have high liquid limit (59 %) and plastic limit (37 %) which indicate high potential swell.

This contrasting behaviour occurs because the coal contains much more free water than the clay-rich interburden layers.

The clay-rich rocks studied were mudstone and siltstone, and these were dip coated in the PES/NMP solution. The uncoated mudstone swelled and broke apart quickly in the immersion test and visual flow test, but the PES coated rock samples were stable for 30  days. The coated rock and coal samples were characterised by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The morphology of coated mudstone and coated coal samples showed that the polymer formed a dense layer across the low-permeability mudstone, but an open porous structure on the coal surface. The effect of the coating on the permeability of KCl brine through coal was measured in a core-flood apparatus. Although the permeability of the coal showed some deterioration after coating, from (0.58  ±  0.12) mD to (0.3  ±  0.03) mD, these results demonstrate the potential of a smart polymer coating to prevent clay swelling while remaining permeable to gas and water on coal layers.|$|E

So characterize the swelling/shrinkage potential of soils after identifying the presence of clay represents a real challenge to reduce expensive reparations on damaged constructions and prevent new buildings to sinister. Experiments were conducted on the two major clayey materials as named Romainville’s green clay and Argenteuil’s blue marl and at the origin of the pathologies encountered near to Paris. After the geotechnical, physico-chemical and mineralogical characterization of materials extracted from a gypsum carrier, mechanical tests were applied to better understand the relation between microstructural characteristics of soils and macroscopic behaviour. An automatised instrumented apparatus developed in LCPC to measure the volumetric shrinkage were uses as well as the free <b>swell</b> <b>test</b> (Makki, 2008). Several parameters impacting to the soil behaviour were identified as the soil density, the numbers of humidification/desiccation cycles, the sample structure (intact or compacted after destructurated soil sample) and the presence of carbonates. This last parameter appears as determining as it can modify the soil sensitivity, compared to the same soils with similar clay. Between aggregates, the carbonates may form cementation submitted to alteration under dry/wet cycles. This cementation, we tried to put in evidence from observations by scanning electron and optical microscopies completed by porosimetric measurement by mercury intrusion, reduce the soil deformation.

The use of chemical additives such as cement and lime to stabilize expansive soils is a common practice among geotechnical engineers especially for lightly loaded structures. However, several occurrences of subgrade failures were observed after stabilizing with chemical additives hence engineers are in search of sustainable stabilization alternatives. Microbial Induced Calcite Precipitation (MICP) is gaining attention as an environmental friendly soil improvement technique. Several researchers have successfully tested its feasibility in mitigating liquefaction induced problems in sandy soils. This research focuses on evaluating its effectiveness in stabilizing expansive soils. For this purpose, three natural expansive soils with high and low plasticity properties were subjected to MICP treatments. Two methods of MICP treatments were followed in this research. The first method was bio-augmentation. In this method the soil samples were first augmented with bacterium Sporosarcina pasteurii and then treated with calcium chloride and urea (substrates) and cured for seven days. In the second method bio-augmentation was followed by stimulation using a nutrient delivery system which was developed to treat microbes with substrates. Variables such as soil types, microbial concentrations and number of pore volumes of substrate injected were studied in this research. Geotechnical testing including Atterberg limits, unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and one-Dimensional (1 -D) <b>swell</b> <b>test</b> along with specific surface area were performed to evaluate the efficacy of MICP treatments. The results indicated that MICP treatments could be a viable alternative for expansive soils treatments. Although the improvement in UCS values after both types of MICP treatments were notable, the strength gain was considerably lower than lime treated soils. However, 1 -D strain reduction was on par with lime stabilized soils. It was also observed that MICP treatments do not result in significant clay mineralogy changes...|$|E
40|$|The {{interdependency}} of microsoil fabric-related {{properties and}} swell/shrink behavior of expansive soils {{needs to be}} identified to achieve a more thorough and accurate prediction of heave of expansive soils. In a recent research study, two microsize-related properties of a soil—pore size distribution and specific surface area—were identified and examined {{in an effort to}} address their synergistic effects on swelling behavior of soils. To study this aspect in detail, eight natural expansive clayey soils from known expansive soil regions were sampled and studied by using two test methods: conventional one-dimensional vertical <b>swell</b> <b>tests</b> and novel three-dimensional volumetric <b>swell</b> strain <b>tests.</b> Microinternal structural details, including pore void distribution, were obtained from mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) studies on compacted soil specimens. Specific surface area (SSA) details of the same soils were determined using the chemical ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (EGME) method. Attempts were made to predict macroswell properties, using both pore and surface area properties. Modeling analyses and results showed that the swelling behavior of the clays was dependent on a newly introduced parameter that accounted for both clay mineralogy constituents and internal pore distribution of the soils. The new swell property models showed accurate predictions of measured swell strains of the present soils, depicting the importance of including mineralogy and pore fabric details in a given soil...|$|R
40|$|A pugmill {{treatability}} {{study was}} conducted to remediate chromite ore processing residue (COPR) using ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O) as a reductant. Two different types of COPR, with respect to particle size and mineralogy, were tested in this study. Two different stoichiometric ratios of FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O to Cr 6 + (5 × and 8 ×) were applied to reduce Cr 6 + to Cr 3 +. The effectiveness of FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O treatment was assessed using the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) tests and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analyses. TCLP results obtained from the pugmill treatability study showed that TCLP Cr concentrations were less than the TCLP regulatory limit of 5 mg/L upon 8 × FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O treatment for up to 420 days but may fail to meet this regulatory limit in the long-term. XANES results obtained from samples cured for 300 days showed that all of the treated samples failed the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) clean up level for Cr 6 + of 240 mg/kg. However, the Cr 6 + concentration from the sample with the smaller particle size approached 240 mg/kg (338 mg/kg), suggesting that particle size reduction prior to the addition of reductant may improve the effectiveness of the treatment. COPR heaving was investigated with unconfined <b>swell</b> <b>tests</b> upon 5 × and 8 × FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O treatment. The formation of ettringite, an expansive material, was investigated following the <b>swell</b> <b>tests</b> using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD).

40|$|Bentonite is {{used for}} {{landfill}} application because of its high sealing ability. Following the swelling phenomenon the water reacts with the bentonite and expands the solid particles. The voids are filled and this reduces permeability of the soil. However, the drawback is the long time needed to assess the hydraulic performance, whereas the engineers require simple and rapid characterization parameters to design the hydraulic barrier. Present paper investigates the possibility of use of rheology testing to describe the swelling properties of bentonite used for geotechnical engineering issues. Rheology testing is proposed to investigate the swelling properties of different nature of bentonite. Different types of bentonite are tested: natural sodium, natural calcium and sodium-activated-calcium bentonites. Rheological measurements are performed in steady and dynamic conditions.

Expansive soils are the cause of significant structural damage every year. These problems result from differential volumetric changes in the soil structure. In this study, a procedure is developed for using the Phase Relationship Equation for Moisture Induced Shrink and Swell (PREMISS). The equation is based on soil weight-volume relationships and the continuity between the changes in air and water volumes within the soil. This equation uses seasonal soil moisture content changes over the depth of the active zone from local databases and soil properties prior to shrink or swell to predict the expected vertical movement beneath foundations. In developing the procedure for using PREMISS, two soil properties were investigated: the swell limit and the shrinkage limit. These limits are the soil moisture contents that correspond with extreme volumetric conditions. Evaluation of laboratory <b>swell</b> <b>test</b> results show that the swell limit probably does exist, and a procedure for measuring the swell limit of a soil is developed. In the shrinkage limit investigation, the Submersion Method shrinkage limit test is proposed. This method measures the undisturbed shrinkage limit as opposed to the remolded shrinkage limit measured by current ASTM Methods. There are two forms of PREMISS. One is the swell form, and the other is the shrinkage form. The manner in which the change in air volume relates to the change in water volume differs for shrink and swell. During swell, the air volume is decreasing, but the air volume change is limited by the initial volume of air. During shrinkage, the air volume is increasing, and the change in air volume is limited by the initial volume of water. How these volume changes occur during soil moisture changes is examined in this study. Evaluation of laboratory swell and shrinkage test results indicates that there is a linear relationship between the changes in air volume and the changes in water volume during shrink and swell. This linear relationship is consistent with PREMISS...|$|E
40|$|A {{dissertation}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the degree Doctor of Engineering (EngD), at Loughborough University. Lime stabilisation is a ground improvement technique used to improve the engineering properties of cohesive fill materials. During earthworks operations, specialist plant is used to rotovate the clay fill material and intermix lime binder around clay clods. After completion of the lime treatment, the layer is compacted in the usual way. Immediately after mixing, the lime instigate a series of physico-chemical reactions within the clay soil. Where the chemical reactions are favourable and with time after compaction (curing) the material becomes progressively stronger and durable to environmental influences, e. g. inundation by surface or ground water. However, where sulphate is present within the soil, the reactions may change and the ingress of water into the layer can result in the expansive growth of deleterious minerals e. g. ettringite. 	While sulphate swell issues are relatively rare, when they do occur the degree of expansion can be very high. A high profile sulphate swell failure developed during {{the construction of the}} M 40, Oxford, UK in 1989. Over the winter period after the lime stabilisation works, a 250 mm deep lime treated layer heaved by up to 150 mm - destroying the overlying road construction. Since the M 40 failure, a substantial amount of effort has been undertaken to better understand the sulphate swell reactions and in this regard the state of scientific knowledge is relatively strong. 	A fundamental issue for field applications of lime stabilisation is {{that the vast majority of}} research has been undertaken on laboratory specimens prepared using methods which do not reflect site practice. Laboratory studies often use oven dried and finely crushed clay, whereas site operations will treat much larger clay clods to result in a more heterogeneous distribution of lime through the compacted soil body. With large clay clods, the chemical reactants must migrate through clods and this may cause the sequence of chemical reactions to change. A further challenge is that laboratory studies are typically undertaken with cure temperatures of 20 °C, whereas a typical near surface temperature in the UK is < 10 °C. This is of particular relevance to sulphate swell failures which are reported to coincide with a reduction in ambient temperature over winter periods. Thus, the direct relevance of laboratory studies to site application was unclear. 	A series of laboratory experiments using a preparation method which reflects field applications of lime stabilisation was used to investigate the influence of large clay clods on the durability of lime stabilised clay soil. This method was applied to both low and high sulphate clay soils. 	A fundamental discovery from work on low sulphate clay is that the addition of lime binder to the surface of the clay clods causes a physico-chemical boundary to form. This boundary develops due to the rapid increase to the plastic limit of the clay preventing adjacent clods from joining together during compaction. This causes the engineering properties of each individual clod to develop independent to its neighbours and for each clay clod to be separated by an inter-clod pore space. The strength of each individual clay clod will increase with curing as the added lime dissociates into Ca 2 + and OH- and migrates to form C-S-H deep within the clods. Where the material is compacted wet of the optimum water content, this condition improves ion migration and enables development of diffuse cementation deep within clods. The inter-clod porosity remains as a weakness throughout curing especially during specimen soaking, where the pore channels comprise a pathway, accelerating the ingress of soaking water. With low sulphate soil, the soaking water softens the treated material, however, with high TPS soil substantial sulphate swelling may develop. Thus, efforts to minimise this porosity during preparation is important and the use of quicklime with longer mellowing periods can cause the clay clods to develop high strength before compaction. The high strength clods resist compaction and the degree of inter-clod porosity in the compacted mass increases, worsening specimen durability to water ingress. 	The investigations into high sulphate clays included the development of a Novel <b>Swell</b> <b>Test</b> (NST) to assess volume change. A unique aspect of the NST was that the sulphate swell response of the lime treated material was investigated at site realistic temperatures of 8 °C. It was identified that, when compared with standard laboratory test temperatures of 20 °C the rate of sulphate swell is substantially higher at the low temperature. The mineralogical testing has permitted the hypothesis that, at 8 °C the growth of crystalline ettringite becomes slower and the ettringite precursor, which has a high affinity to imbibe water, remains in this state for much longer. Thus, laboratory swell tests at 20 °C may substantially underestimate the degree of swell that may develop in the field. As a pressing need, it is recommended that the industry adapt sulphate <b>swell</b> <b>test</b> methods to appraise the degree of swell at field realistic temperatures i. e. < 10 °C. The work also identifies that the primary defence against sulphate swell is to condition the fill so that the risk of post compaction water ingress, via inter-clod porosity, is minimised. The use of GGBS and water addition during extended mellowing periods also reduces the degree of sulphate swell in natural clay soils. 	This work concludes that working methods for lime stabilisation of medium high plasticity soils of a potentially high sulphate content, should be adapted to encourage diffuse cementation and minimise the degree of (post compaction) inter-clod porosity. Practically this involves the use of hydrated lime and the addition of mixing water throughout extended mellowing periods. Fundamentally, the study recommends that where construction programmes allow, the long term durability of a fill material should be the priority over immediate strength...|$|E
40|$|Saskatchewan Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure (MHI) is {{responsible}} for maintaining approximately 26, 100 km of two lane equivalent highways network. Most highways in Saskatchewan are constructed primarily of granular materials. Granular materials serve various purposes in a pavement structure. In particular, granular materials distribute stress within the road structure and reduce the stress applied to the subgrade. Granular materials also mitigate pumping of subgrade fines into surfacing materials, {{as well as provide}} drainage for the pavement structure. As a result of the rapid deterioration of roadways and the increasing highway traffic, {{a significant portion of the}} Saskatchewan highway system is in need of rehabilitation in the next couple of decades. However, increasing costs associated with road construction as well as budget constraints render many conventional rehabilitation solutions untenable in many applications. In addition, the depletion of quality aggregate also exists in many areas of Saskatchewan. Given that much of Saskatchewan granular pavement system will be in need of strengthening in the next few decades, there is a need to apply new cost-effective and aggregate-preserving pavement rehabilitation technologies such as cold in-place recycling and base strengthening. The goal of this research is to improve the engineering design and performance of recycled and stabilized granular base systems under Saskatchewan field state conditions. The specific objectives of this research are to characterize the conventional laboratory behaviour, moisture sensitivity, and mechanistic behaviour of various granular base strengthening systems in the laboratory, to characterize the structural responses of various granular base strengthening systems in the field, and to evaluate the pavement thickness design and responses of various granular base pavement structures. This research is based on a cold in-place recycling and base stabilization project undertaken by Saskatchewan MHI in fall 2006. Control Section (C. S.) 15 - 11 between km 5. 0 and km 8. 0 was selected as a typical thin granular pavement under primary weight loadings that required strengthening. Unstabilized granular base, cement stabilized granular base, and cement with asphalt emulsion stabilized granular base were constructed and evaluated in this research. Materials employed on C. S. 15 - 11 were sampled and prepared for the various laboratory tests performed in this research. Conventional tests performed included sieve analysis, Atterberg limits, sand equivalent, standard proctor compaction, and California bearing ratio strength and <b>swell</b> <b>test.</b> Advanced mechanistic and moisture sensitivity testing included indirect tensile strength, moisture capillary rise and surface conductivity, unconfined compressive strength, and rapid triaxial frequency sweep testing. The cement and cement with emulsion asphalt stabilization of the granular base were found to improve the conventional, mechanical and moisture susceptibility properties of in situ C. S. 15 - 11 granular base materials. The cement stabilization applied on C. S. 15 - 11 provided a high degree of improvement relative to the cement with emulsion stabilization. The cement stabilization was found to be relatively easy to apply in construction, whereas the cement with emulsion stabilization was more difficult, particularly due to the problems associated with cold temperatures during late season construction. The rapid triaxial tester (RaTT) was found to be a practical and useful apparatus to characterize the mechanistic constitutive behaviours of granular materials. The C. S. 15 - 11 in situ unstabilized base was found to have the poorest mechanistic behaviour among all three granular bases on C. S. 15 - 11, as expected. Cement stabilization improved the mechanistic behaviour of the in situ material significantly by providing the highest mean dynamic modulus, lowest mean Poisson’s ratio, lowest mean radial microstrain, and the lowest mean phase angle. The cement with emulsion asphalt stabilization also provided a considerable improvement on mechanistic behaviour of C. S. 15 - 11 granular base materials. However, the degree of improvement was less than the cement stabilization system. Non-destructive falling weight deflection measurements taken across the field test sections showed that the stabilization systems yielded a significant improvement of primary structural response profiles across the C. S. 15 - 11 test sections after stabilization. The cement stabilization system was found to yield the most significant structural improvements among all the test sections constructed on the C. S. 15 - 11. The deflection measurements taken in 2007 after hot mix asphalt paving further identified that the unstabilized system is more sensitive to the freeze-thaw effects relative to cement stabilization and cement with emulsion stabilization systems. This research also showed that the Saskatchewan MHI structural design system is not applicable to the design of stabilized granular base systems. Evaluation of the thickness design for C. S. 15 - 11 showed the unstabilized and the cement with asphalt emulsion stabilized test section met the criterion of fatigue cracking, but failed to meet the criterion of structural rutting in MHI design system. However, the cement stabilized section met both fatigue cracking and rutting criteria. The structural evaluation revealed that mechanistic pavement response analysis and validation are necessary in the thickness design of stabilized granular systems such as C. S. 15 - 11, where traditional MHI design system is not applicable. This research employed finite element modeling and linear elastic pavement modeling software to determine the maximum shear stresses within granular base under typical Saskatchewan stress state conditions. The maximum shear stress values were found to locate on top of granular base courses under the applied circular loading edges ranging from 177 kPa to 254 kPa. These maximum shear stresses within the C. S. 15 - 11 test section granular base courses under field stress states were compared to maximum shear stresses occurring within samples measured by rapid triaxial testing performed in this research. The comparison showed that the ranges of shear stresses applied in the laboratory RaTT testing were close to shear stresses of granular bases in the field computed from modeling. Therefore, this research showed a good correlation of lab RaTT testing and field results for granular pavements. In summary, this research met the objectives of mechanistically evaluating various granular base stabilization systems in Saskatchewan by means of various laboratory testing, non-destructive field testing, as well as mechanistic modeling and analysis. This research provided valuable data and showed considerable potential for improving design, construction, and QA/QC of conventional and stabilized granular base systems in Saskatchewan...|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} to predict the swelling pressure {{and the amount of}} swell of an expansive soil. These methods generally involve the use of a one-dimensional consolidation apparatus (i. e., oedometer). A large amount of test results and experience involving these {{methods have been}} reported. In contrast, little attempt has been made to formulate a theoretical framework to simulate these testing procedures and to visualize the different stress paths used in the various methods. The primary objective of this research program is to formulate a theoretical framework which can embrace all swelling testing procedures. The formulations are to accommodate various boundary conditions and to simulate the stress paths that have been followed using various testing procedures. The research program commenced with a literature review which provided a summary of the research which have been conducted on laboratory swelling pressure measurement and the theoretical simulation of <b>swell</b> <b>testing</b> methods. A theoretical model for describing the pore-water pressure and volume change behavior during various swelling oedometer tests is formulated. The theory is based on the equilibrium equation, the constitutive equations for unsaturated soils and the continuity equation for the pore fluids. A computer program, SWELL, based on the theoretical model is developed using finite element method. The presented theory is used to describe the behavior observed during the experimental program. Several types of laboratory tests (i. e., falling head permeability <b>test,</b> Free <b>Swell</b> oedometer <b>test,</b> pressure plate test, shrinkage test and constant suction consolidation test) were performed to identify the appropriate soil properties and variables which control the swelling behavior of an unsaturated soil during the swelling oedometer tests.

Additional analyses were conducted using various values for the saturated coefficient of permeability and the imposed boundary conditions.
