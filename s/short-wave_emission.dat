40|$|Low-dispersion UV spectra {{taken by}} the IUE {{satellite}} of an S star HD 35155 are presented. It is shown that the spectra contain strong emission lines of multiply ionizes species and an excess continuous emission shortward of 2000 A. Because neither the photospheres nor chromospheres of S stars are expected to produce multiply ionized ions, the emission lines and the excess <b>short-wave</b> <b>emission</b> seen in the HD 35155 spectra are interpreted as an evidence {{of the presence of}} a hot nearby compact companion. Some inferences regarding the compact companion and the possible location of the source of the emission lines of multiply ionized ions are discussed...|$|E
30|$|The PL {{spectrum}} of nanocomposite (Figure 3, curve 4 a) shows more effective luminescence than as-prepared porous Si (curve 1 a) {{with an equal}} amount of nanomaterial. Curve 2 refers to PL of MCC sample. The shape of this spectrum in some cases split into several peaks, indicating the presence of few types of organic fluorophores in a matrix of cellulose. A possible reason for such luminescence might be the presence of carbonyl groups and different kinds of low-molecular products of cellulose destruction in this material [6]. After the formation of NCC, a fluorescent activity in short-wavelength region is significantly reduced (curve 3), {{and in the case of}} nanocomposite practically disappears (curve 4). In this case, the presence of Si nanoparticles leads to the suppression of <b>short-wave</b> <b>emission,</b> but it is premature to assume the existence of an energy transfer channel from cellulose matrix to semiconductor nanoparticles.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Carbonates of {{different}} origin, such as Iceland spar, calcites, and mollusc shells, used as {{electron spin resonance}} and thermoluminescence palaeodosimeters, were studied {{in order to determine}} their suitability for optically stimulated luminescence dating. The stimulation/excitation spectra of the afterglow of the samples were recorded in the wavelength range of 250 – 1100 nm. The results of the study show that these spectra present either excitation spectra of Mn 2 + ion fluorescence (samples of calcites and Iceland spar, red emission recorded) or the excitation spectra of primary phosphorescence (samples of carbonates, including mollusc shells; <b>short-wave</b> <b>emission</b> bands recorded). The recorded stimulation spectra revealed no spectral bands sensitive to stimulation by ionizing radiation, which would disappear as a result of heating and could thus be related to deep traps in carbonates, needed in dating. The causes of this situation which is unusual in luminescent crystals, including luminescence (palaeo) dosimeters, and the ways of overcoming the difficulties in optical dating of natural carbonates are discussed. Key words: carbonates, optical dating, optically stimulated afterglow...|$|E
30|$|We have {{concluded}} that observed spectral dependence of the ρ value in nc-Si−SiOx structures in long-wavelength region can be explained {{on the basis of}} classical surface charge (dielectric) model. In <b>short-wave</b> region of <b>emission</b> spectra, it is necessary to take into consideration the contribution of quantum confined model in which the degree of polarization increases with decreasing nanostructure size.|$|R
40|$|Recently the {{significant}} increase in intensity of researches {{in the field of}} the fissile impact on geophysical processes in various environments is noted. Special attention is paid to a research of impact on an ionosphere of a potent <b>short-wave</b> radio <b>emission</b> of heating stands. Today experiments on change of an ionosphere are made generally at stands HAARP, EISCAT in Tromse (Norway). Within the Russian campaign (Tomsk) EISCAT/heating (AARI_HFOX) made from October 19 to October 30, 2016 experiments on impact on an ionosphere F-layer by the radiation potent HF. For assessment of impact of these experiments on geophysical processes mathematical methods carried out the analysis of change of the parameters of the Schumann resonances received on the basis of data from the station of constant observation of the Schumann resonances in the city of Tomsk, the Tomsk State University (Russia) ...|$|R
40|$|Aerosols {{affect the}} {{atmosphere}} through direct interaction with short-wave and long-wave radiation and the microphysical properties of clouds. In this paper we report in detail on several {{mechanisms by which}} the short-term impact of dust on surface radiative fluxes can affect the dust loading of the atmosphere via modification of boundary-layer meteorology. This in turn affects the aerosol radiative forcing itself. Examples of these feedbacks between dust and boundary layer meteorology were observed during a series of dust storms in the Sahara and the eastern Mediterranean in April 2012. These case studies have been analysed using the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate – Interim Implementation (MACC-II) system. The radiative fluxes in the short-wave and long-wave spectra were both significantly affected by the prognostic aerosol–radiation interaction, which in turn impacted the meteorological simulation. Reduced incoming solar radiation below the aerosol layers led to a decrease in maximum surface temperatures and to a more stable thermal stratification of the lower atmosphere. This in turn forced weaker surface wind speeds and eventually smaller dust emissions. Moreover, we also observed a secondary impact of the aerosol radiative forcing, whereby horizontal gradients of surface temperature were increased {{at the edge of}} the dust plume, which led to local increases of surface wind speeds due to the thermal wind effect. The differentiated impact of the aerosol layer on surface pressure also contributed to the increase in surface wind speed and dust production in the same area. Enhanced long-wave radiative fluxes by the dust mass were associated with opposite processes. Less stable thermal stratification at night, brought mainly by higher minimum temperatures at the surface, caused stronger surface winds. At the edge of the dust storm, weaker horizontal temperature and pressure gradients forced lower winds and reduced dust production. Regarding dust <b>emissions,</b> <b>short-wave</b> radiative forcing had a larger impact than long-wave radiative forcing, corroborating several previous studies. For surface temperature, short-wave and long-wave contribution were close in intensity. These feedbacks were amplified when using data assimilation to build the aerosol analysis of the MACC-II global system. This led to an improvement in the short-term forecasts of thermal radiative fluxes and surface temperatures...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the results of a {{laboratory}} investigation using a rotating two-layer annulus experiment, which exhibits both large-scale vortical modes and short-scale divergent modes. A sophisticated visualization method allows us to observe the flow at very high spatial and temporal resolution. The balanced long-wavelength modes appear only when the Froude number is supercritical (i. e. F > F critical ≡ π²/ 2), and are therefore consistent with generation by a baroclinic instability. The unbalanced short-wavelength modes appear locally in every single baroclinically unstable flow, providing perhaps the first direct experimental evidence that all evolving vortical flows will tend to emit freely propagating inertia-gravity waves. The short-wavelength modes also appear in certain baroclinically stable flows. We infer the generation mechanisms of the short-scale waves, both for the baroclinically unstable case in which they co-exist with a large-scale wave, and for the baroclinically stable case in which they exist alone. The two possible mechanisms considered are spontaneous adjustment of the large-scale flow, and Kelvin-Helmholtz shear instability. Short modes in the baroclinically stable regime are generated only when the Richardson number is subcritical (i. e. Ri < Ri critical ≡ 1), and are therefore consistent with generation by a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We calculate five indicators of short-wave generation in the baroclinically unstable regime, using data from a quasi-geostrophic numerical model of the annulus. There is excellent agreement between the spatial locations of <b>short-wave</b> <b>emission</b> observed in the laboratory, and regions in which the model Lighthill/Ford inertia-gravity wave source term is large. We infer that the short waves in the baroclinically unstable fluid are freely propagating intertia-gravity waves generated by spontaneous adjustment of the large-scale flow. Citation: Williams, P.
