5|$|As bikinis leave most of {{the body}} exposed to {{potentially}} dangerous UV radiation, overexposure can cause sunburn, skin cancer, {{as well as other}} acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eyes, and immune system. As a result, medical organizations recommend that bikini wearers protect themselves from UV radiation by using broad-spectrum sunscreen, which has been shown to protect against sunburn, skin cancer, wrinkling and sagging skin. Certain sunscreen ingredients can cause harm if they penetrate the <b>skin</b> <b>over</b> time.|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} is congenital and {{is characterized by}} a number of nasal, facial and cranial features. These include a broad and high, sometimes depressed nasal bridge (top of the nose, between the eyes) and a flattened nasal tip. This can give the nose a shortened, arch-like appearance. Hypertelorism (unusually wide-set eyes), prominent frontal bones and supraorbital ridge (the eyebrow ridge), bilateral epicanthic folds (an extra flap of <b>skin</b> <b>over</b> the eyelids), a broad forehead and an overall enlarged head circumference have also been observed. A bulging of the upper lip with an exaggerated cupid's bow shape, and maxillary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the upper jaw) with retraction have also been reported.|$|E
5|$|A sponge's body is {{hollow and}} {{is held in}} shape by the mesohyl, a jelly-like {{substance}} made mainly of collagen and reinforced by a dense network of fibers also made of collagen. The inner surface is covered with choanocytes, cells with cylindrical or conical collars surrounding one flagellum per choanocyte. The wave-like motion of the whip-like flagella drives water through the sponge's body. All sponges have ostia, channels leading to the interior through the mesohyl, and in most sponges these are controlled by tube-like porocytes that form closable inlet valves. Pinacocytes, plate-like cells, form a single-layered external <b>skin</b> <b>over</b> all {{other parts of the}} mesohyl that are not covered by choanocytes, and the pinacocytes also digest food particles that are too large to enter the ostia, while those {{at the base of the}} animal are responsible for anchoring it.|$|E

5|$|Psoriasis vulgaris (also {{known as}} chronic {{stationary}} psoriasis or plaque-like psoriasis) {{is the most}} common form and affects 85%–90% of people with psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis typically appears as raised areas of inflamed skin covered with silvery-white scaly skin. These areas are called plaques and are most commonly found on the elbows, knees, scalp, and back. Psoriatic erythroderma (erythrodermic psoriasis) involves widespread inflammation and exfoliation of the <b>skin</b> <b>over</b> most of the body surface. It may be accompanied by severe itching, swelling, and pain. It is often the result of an exacerbation of unstable plaque psoriasis, particularly following the abrupt withdrawal of systemic glucocorticoids. This form of psoriasis can be fatal as the extreme inflammation and exfoliation disrupt the body's ability to regulate temperature and perform barrier functions.|$|E
5|$|The skins or {{heads of}} taiko are {{generally}} made from cowhide from Holstein cows aged {{about three or}} four years. Skins also come from horses, and bull skin is preferred for larger drums. Thinner skins are preferred for smaller taiko, and thicker skins are used for larger ones. On some drumheads, a patch of deer skin placed in the center serves as the target for many strokes during performance. Before fitting it to the drum body the hair is removed from the hide by soaking it in a river or stream for about a month; winter months are preferred as colder temperatures better facilitate hair removal. To stretch the <b>skin</b> <b>over</b> the drum properly, one process requires the body to be held on a platform with several hydraulic jacks underneath it. The edges of the cowhide are secured to an apparatus below the jacks, and the jacks stretch the skin incrementally to precisely apply tension across the drumhead. Other forms of stretching use rope or cords with wooden dowels or an iron wheel to create appropriate tension. Small tension adjustments can be made during this process using small pieces of bamboo that twist around the ropes. Particularly large drumheads are sometimes stretched by having several workers, clad in stockings, hop rhythmically atop it, forming a circle along the edge. After the skin has dried, tacks, called byō, are added to the appropriate drums to secure it; chū-daiko require about 300 of them for each side. After the body and skin have been finished, excess hide is cut off and the drum can be stained as needed.|$|E

25|$|Women's orgasms are {{preceded by}} {{erection}} of the clitoris and moistening {{of the opening}} of the vagina. Some women exhibit a sex flush, a reddening of the <b>skin</b> <b>over</b> much of the body due to increased blood flow to the skin. As a woman nears orgasm, the clitoral glans retracts under the clitoral hood, and the labia minora (inner lips) become darker. As orgasm becomes imminent, the outer third of the vagina tightens and narrows, while overall the vagina lengthens and dilates and also becomes congested from engorged soft tissue.|$|E

25|$|Dracunculiasis, {{also called}} Guinea-worm disease (GWD), is an {{infection}} by the Guinea worm. A person becomes infected when they drink water that contains water fleas infected with guinea worm larvae. Initially {{there are no}} symptoms. About one year later, the person develops a painful burning feeling as the female worm forms a blister in the skin, usually on a lower limb. The worm then emerges from the <b>skin</b> <b>over</b> {{the course of a}} few weeks. During this time, {{it may be difficult to}} walk or work. It is very uncommon for the disease to cause death.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{the skin}} was {{attached}} by wooden pegs that were driven through holes in the skin and the shell near the playing edge. Four to five people would stretch the wet <b>skin</b> <b>over</b> the drum to apply tension while the pegs were driven into the bowl. The shrinkage of the skin while it dried then applied sufficient additional tension for the skin to resonate. A similar mounting technique is still used by the Landouma (a subgroup of the Baga people) for a djembe-like drum known as a gumbe. This mounting technique most likely goes back hundreds of years; the exact period is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The second Mü22, {{given the}} suffix 'b', {{followed}} the design {{principles of the}} original crashed version but introduced an all-flying vee-tail and a smoother fibreglass covered forward fuselage to reduce drag. Construction of the laminar flow wings, using plywood <b>skin</b> <b>over</b> closely spaced ribs, gives an accurate profile which has remained true since manufacture. Flight testing commenced in 1964 but was marred, on 5 June 1964, {{by the failure of}} a bolt attaching a bearing in the tail unit, the tail fluttered dramatically breaking the tail unit off the fuselage. The pilot, Dipl.-Ing. Frodo Hadwich, bailed out safely and the glider impacted relatively softly enabling repairs to be carried out.|$|E

25|$|The skin is held {{in place}} by being trapped between the top ring, called the crown ring, and the ring below it, called the flesh ring. A third ring (the bottom ring) is placed around the stem. The rings are {{commonly}} made from 6–8mm (¼–⅓in) rebar. A series of cow hitches on the crown ring and bottom ring form loops. Through these loops, a length of rope connects the crown ring and the bottom ring; tightening this rope applies tension. As the vertical rope is tensioned, the cow hitches on the crown ring press the skin against the flesh ring below; this attaches the skin to the flesh ring very securely and stretches the <b>skin</b> <b>over</b> the bearing edge of the drum.|$|E
25|$|After a quick TKO {{victory over}} {{decorated}} judoka Yoon Dong-Sik {{in the opening}} round, Sakuraba suffered a particularly devastating yet controversial loss against Ricardo Arona in the quarterfinal of the tournament in June 2005. Although Sakuraba put Arona {{on his back and}} seemed to put to work his signature jumping stomps, the heavier and stronger Arona soon overpowered him, landing a series of brutal knees to the head, as well as hard soccer kicks to the face. The Brazilian's toenail accidentally slashed open the <b>skin</b> <b>over</b> Sakuraba's left eye, which Ricardo then capitalized on by squeezing the cut and digging his finger into it in order to force the doctor stoppage. The Japanese tried to keep on, but Arona hit another flurry of knees to the head, and ended the fight landing soccer kick after soccer kick, rendering Kazushi's face severely swollen and bloody. Arona won by unanimous decision.|$|E
500|$|References to horned rabbits may {{originate}} in sightings of rabbits {{affected by the}} Shope papilloma virus, named for Richard E.
