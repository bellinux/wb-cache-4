5|$|The <b>substituent</b> {{name for}} a ring {{compound}} is cyclo.|$|E
5|$|Ka is the {{dissociation}} constant of a substituted compound, K is the {{dissociation constant}} when the <b>substituent</b> is hydrogen, ρ is a {{property of the}} unsubstituted compound and σ has a particular value for each <b>substituent.</b> A plot of log(Ka) against σ is a straight line with intercept log(K) and slope ρ. This {{is an example of}} a linear free energy relationship as log(Ka) is proportional to the standard fee energy change. Hammett originally formulated the relationship with data from benzoic acid with different substiuents in the ortho- and para- positions: some numerical values are in Hammett equation. This and other studies allowed substituents to be ordered according to their electron-withdrawing or electron-releasing power, and to distinguish between inductive and mesomeric effects.|$|E
50|$|One cheminformatics study {{identified}} 849,574 unique <b>substituents</b> up to 12 non-hydrogen atoms {{large and}} containing only carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus, selenium, and the halogens {{in a set}} of 3,043,941 molecules. Fifty <b>substituents</b> can be considered common as they are found in more than 1% of this set, and 438 are found in more than 0.1%. 64% of the <b>substituents</b> are found in only one molecule. The top 5 most common are the methyl, phenyl, chlorine, methoxy, and hydroxyl <b>substituents.</b> The total number of organic <b>substituents</b> in organic chemistry is estimated at 3.1 million, creating a total of 6.7×1023 molecules. An infinite number of <b>substituents</b> can be obtained simply by increasing carbon chain length. For instance, the <b>substituents</b> methyl (-CH3) and pentyl (-C5H11).|$|R
5000|$|Electron-donating <b>substituents</b> on the epoxide are {{stabilizing}} and electron-withdrawing <b>substituents</b> are destabilizing.|$|R
50|$|Ketones and {{aldehydes}} with electron-withdrawing <b>substituents</b> react {{more readily}} with diazoalkanes than those bearing electron-donating <b>substituents</b> (Table 2). In addition to accelerating the reaction, electron-withdrawing <b>substituents</b> typically {{increase the amount}} of epoxide produced (Table 2).|$|R
5|$|Alcohols do not {{normally}} behave as acids in water, but {{the presence of}} a double bond adjacent to the OH group can substantially decrease the pKa by the mechanism of keto–enol tautomerism. Ascorbic acid is an example of this effect. The diketone 2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone) is also a weak acid because of the keto–enol equilibrium. In aromatic compounds, such as phenol, which have an OH <b>substituent,</b> conjugation with the aromatic ring as a whole greatly increases the stability of the deprotonated form.|$|E
5|$|With {{organic acids}} {{inductive}} effects and mesomeric effects affect the pKa values. A simple example {{is provided by}} the effect of replacing the hydrogen atoms in acetic acid by the more electronegative chlorine atom. The electron-withdrawing effect of the <b>substituent</b> makes ionisation easier, so successive pKa values decrease in the series 4.7, 2.8, 1.4, and 0.7 when 0, 1, 2, or 3 chlorine atoms are present. The Hammett equation, provides a general expression for the effect of substituents.|$|E
5|$|X-ray crystallographic {{studies of}} {{warfarin}} {{show that it}} exists in tautomeric form, as the cyclic hemiketal, which is formed from the 4-hydroxycoumarin and the ketone in the 3-position <b>substituent.</b> However, the existence of many 4-hydroxycoumadin anticoagulants (for example phenprocoumon) that possess no ketone group in the 3-substituent to form such a structure, suggests that the hemiketal must tautomerise to the 4-hydroxy form in order for warfarin to be active.|$|E
25|$|Tacticity {{describes}} the relative stereochemistry of chiral centers in neighboring structural units within a macromolecule. There are three types: isotactic (all <b>substituents</b> {{on the same}} side), atactic (random placement of <b>substituents),</b> and syndiotactic (alternating placement of <b>substituents).</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{electronic}} {{properties of}} the <b>substituents</b> also influence {{the strength of the}} attraction. Electron withdrawing groups (for example, cyano CN) weaken the interaction, while electron donating <b>substituents</b> (for example, amino NH2) strengthen the cation–π binding. This relationship is illustrated quantitatively in the margin for several <b>substituents.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of aryl <b>substituents</b> in dibenzylidene acetone (dba) ligands, for Pd(0) complexes, has been evaluated for Suzuki−Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. Electron-withdrawing <b>substituents</b> such as NO 2 or CF 3 deactivate the catalyst species whereas strongly donating <b>substituents</b> such as OMe increase catalytic activity over that of unsubstituted dba ligands...|$|R
5|$|Proteins {{based on}} {{cobalamin}} use corrin {{to hold the}} cobalt. Coenzyme B12 features a reactive C-Co bond that participates in the reactions. In humans, B12 has two types of alkyl ligand: methyl and adenosyl. MeB12 promotes methyl (-CH3) group transfers. The adenosyl version of B12 catalyzes rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second <b>substituent,</b> X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine. Methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase (MUT) converts MMl-CoA to Su-CoA, {{an important step in}} the extraction of energy from proteins and fats.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin is a {{tryptamine}} compound with {{a chemical}} structure containing an indole ring {{linked to an}} ethylamine <b>substituent.</b> It is chemically related to the amino acid tryptophan, and is structurally similar to the neurotransmitter serotonin. Psilocybin {{is a member of}} the general class of tryptophan-based compounds that originally functioned as antioxidants in earlier life forms before assuming more complex functions in multicellular organisms, including humans. Other related indole-containing psychedelic compounds include dimethyltryptamine, found in many plant species and in trace amounts in some mammals, and bufotenine, found in the skin of psychoactive toads.|$|E
25|$|The {{corresponding}} <b>substituent</b> {{is called}} indolyl.|$|E
40|$|The <b>substituents</b> of quinones play an {{important}} role in modulating the kinetics of the electron-and proton-transfer reaction. In this paper, the steric effects of <b>substituents</b> of quinones on their catalytic performance were studied in the oxidation of ethylbenzene and ascorbate. The <b>substituents</b> limited the addition of the free radicals to the C=C double bonds of the quinone ring because of the steric hindrance. On the other hand, too many <b>substituents</b> hindered the contact between the active site (C=O) of quinone and the reactant. So, the quinones with two <b>substituents</b> presented better catalytic performance than those with more or less <b>substituents.</b> These results will be helpful in designing the quinone compounds for drugs and in understanding the catalytic behavior of quinones in biochemistry.

50|$|Although fluoromethane is {{a special}} case, the above {{argument}} {{can be applied to}} any structure with a central atom and 2 or more <b>substituents.</b> The key is that concentrating atomic s character in orbitals directed towards electropositive <b>substituents</b> is more favorable than removing s character from orbitals directed towards electronegative <b>substituents.</b>|$|R
25|$|Oxazoles {{containing}} two methyl groups exhibit interesting selectivity patterns. In {{the absence}} of a directing <b>substituent,</b> the methyl group closer to the more electronegative oxygen atom is selectively metalated. However, {{in the presence of a}} directing <b>substituent,</b> the director fully controls the site of lithiation.|$|E
25|$|When {{both the}} Lewis acidity of the organolithium {{compound}} and the Lewis basicity of the <b>substituent</b> are high, as in lithiations of ortho-(dialkylamino)methyl toluenes with n-butyllithium in a non-coordinating solvent, coordination {{of the base}} to the heteroatom <b>substituent</b> takes place. Lithiation then occurs at the most kinetically accessible ortho benzylic position; ortho lithiation is slower in this case.|$|E
25|$|In {{the model}} studies to {{synthesize}} chlorothricolide, an intramolecular Diels Alder reaction gave {{a mixture of}} diastereomers. But by installing the a bulky TMS <b>substituent,</b> the reaction gave the desired product in high diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity in good yield. The bulky TMS <b>substituent</b> helps enhance allylic 1,3 strain in the conformation of the molecule.|$|E
40|$|A novel palladium-catalyzed {{synthesis}} of free N-H 2, 3 -disubstituted indoles from arenediazonium tetrafluoroborates and 2 -alkynyltrifluoroacetanilides is presented. The reaction tolerates {{a variety of}} useful <b>substituents</b> both in the starting alkyne and the arenediazonium salt, including bromo and chloro <b>substituents,</b> nitro, cyano, keto, ester, and ether groups, as well as ortho <b>substituents</b> such as methoxy and methyl groups...|$|R
50|$|Lone pair-containing <b>substituents</b> like -NH2, -OH, and -SH are {{stabilizing}} since p-donation overcomes inductively withdrawing effects. Conjugated {{systems like}} -CH=CH2 and -C6H5 are stabilizing due to strong p-donation. Highly destabilizing <b>substituents</b> like -CF3 and -NO2 only exhibit inductive electron withdrawal. Weakly destabilizing <b>substituents</b> like -CN has a weak p-donation effect {{that does not}} completely curb induction by electron withdrawal.|$|R
2500|$|The aza-Cope/Mannich reaction, when {{participating}} in ring-expanding annulations, follows the stereochemistry {{dictated by the}} most favorable chair conformation, which generally places bulky <b>substituents</b> quasi-equatorially. [...] The vinyl and amine components can have either syn or anti relationships when installed on a ring[...] [...] While anti vinyl and amine <b>substituents</b> generally only have one favored transition state, leading to a cis fused ring system, the favored product of syn <b>substituents</b> can change, dictated by steric interactions with solvents or large N-substituents, which may take preference over bulky <b>substituents</b> and change the transition state.|$|R
25|$|This {{transition}} state likely {{occurs because}} of favorable pi-stacking with the phenyl <b>substituent.</b> The enantioselectivity {{of the process}} is facilitated from the diene approaching the dienophile from the opposite face of the phenyl <b>substituent.</b> The Diels-Alder reaction {{is one of the}} most powerful transformations in synthetic chemistry. The synthesis of natural products using the Diels-Alder reaction as a transform has been applied especially to the formation of six-membered rings(scheme 18).|$|E

25|$|Methcathinone is a beta-keto N-methylamphetamine and {{is closely}} related to the {{naturally}} occurring compounds, cathinone and cathine. It is also very closely related to methamphetamine, differing by only the β-ketone <b>substituent</b> and differing from amphetamine by both a keto and N-methyl <b>substituent.</b> Its carbon skeleton is identical to pseudoephedrine and methamphetamine. It differs from pseudoephedrine in that the hydroxide beta to the aromatic ring is oxidized to a ketone.|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{orientation of the}} first layers and thin films of differently substituted phthalocyanines on gold substrates is compared. Due to a relatively strong molecule-substrate interaction the orientation {{is parallel to the}} sample surface for all materials in the first layers. At higher film thickness the orientation is determined by the <b>substituents.</b> Materials with short <b>substituents</b> prefer standing orientation, implying the <b>substituents</b> do not inhibit the intermolecular interactions. Molecules with long <b>substituents</b> are not able to build up the same aggregates, they grow disordered in the upper layers...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of preparing 4 -fluorophenol or 4 -fluorobenzoic acid via the Baeyer-Villiger reaction starting from unsymmetrical fluoroaryl ketones is discussed. Several unsymmetrical 4 -fluorobenzophenones having different <b>substituents</b> in the fluorine-free aryl group were prepared and converted to esters by treatment with peracetic acid. The electrophilicity of the <b>substituents</b> influenced the molecular {{structure of the}} ester formed {{as a result of}} a carbon-to-oxygen migration, and hence 4 -fluorophenol or 4 -fluorobenzoic acid formation. Electron-withdrawing <b>substituents</b> favoured the formation of 4 -fluorophenol in good yield, while electron-donating <b>substituents</b> formed 4 -fluorobenzoic acid preferentially...|$|R

25|$|In the {{presence}} of progesterone, mifepristone acts as a competitive progesterone receptor antagonist (in the absence of progesterone, mifepristone acts as a partial agonist). Mifepristone is a 19-nor steroid with a bulky p-(dimethylamino)phenyl <b>substituent</b> above {{the plane of the}} molecule at the 11β-position responsible for inducing or stabilizing an inactive receptor conformation and a hydrophobic 1-propynyl <b>substituent</b> below the plane of the molecule at the 17α-position that increases its progesterone receptor binding affinity.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the radical}} anion is {{initially}} protonated determines {{the structure of}} the product. With an electron donor such as methoxy (MeO) or with an alkyl group, protonation has been thought by some investigators as being ortho (i.e. adjacent or 1,2) to the <b>substituent.</b> Other investigators have thought the protonation is meta (1,3) to the <b>substituent.</b> Arthur Birch favored meta protonation. With electron withdrawing substituents, protonation has been thought to occur {{at the site of the}} <b>substituent</b> (ipso), or para (1,4). Again, there has been varied opinion. A. J. Birch's empirical rules say that for the donor substituents the final product has the maximum number of substituents on the final double bonds. For electron withdrawing groups the double bonds of the product avoid the substituents. The placement preference of groups in the mechanism and in the final product is termed regioselectivity.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the effect}} of varying substituents on the {{catalyst}} is rarely well understood. Small <b>substituent</b> changes can completely change reactivity or selectivity. An example of {{this was in the}} optimization studies of a bifunctional Strecker reaction catalyst, one of the first well-studied thiourea catalysts. Specifically, varying the X <b>substituent</b> on the salicylaldimine <b>substituent,</b> it was found that typical electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituents had little effect on the rate, but ester substituents such as acetate or pivaloate seemed to cause noticeable rate acceleration. This observation is difficult to rationalize given that the X group is far from the reactive center {{during the course of the}} reaction and electronics do not seem to be the cause. In general, despite the relative ease of electronic tuning with organic catalysts, chemists have not yet reached a useful understanding of these modifications.|$|E
50|$|Stereoisomerism about double bonds arises because {{rotation}} {{about the}} double bond is restricted, keeping the <b>substituents</b> fixed relative to each other. If the two <b>substituents</b> {{on at least}} one end of a double bond are the same, then there is no stereoisomer and the double bond is not a stereocenter, e.g. propene, CH3CH=CH2 where the two <b>substituents</b> at one end are both H.|$|R
50|$|In 1978, Günther Maier {{prepared}} a stable tetrahedrane derivative with four tert-butyl <b>substituents.</b> These <b>substituents</b> are very bulky, and completely envelop the tetrahedrane core. Maier suggested that bonds {{in the core}} are prevented from breaking because this would force the <b>substituents</b> closer together (corset effect) resulting in Van der Waals strain. Tetrahedrane {{is one of the}} possible platonic hydrocarbons and has the IUPAC name tricyclo1.1.0.02,4butane.|$|R
