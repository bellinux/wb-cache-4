40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a recent investigation into 'thermal time constant' nondestructive testing of high reliability <b>electrical</b> <b>fuses.</b> The use of established nondestructive test technology for examining the quality and firing characteristics of electro-explosive devices has been successfully applied to the inspection and prediction of the functional performance of <b>electrical</b> <b>fuses.</b> The technique requires application of a low level current pulse to the <b>electrical</b> <b>fuse</b> with an oscilloscope display of the curve as generated by the temperature coefficient of resistance feedback. The heating curve of temperature vs time is composed of one predominant thermal time constant, which is the product of the test unit's thermal capacity and thermal resistance. It has been found that the quality of the individual <b>electrical</b> <b>fuse,</b> for instance, the relative condition of the critical internal weld or solder joint, can be examined nondestructively...|$|R

50|$|On 12 November 2011 at 7:45 PM {{local time}} a {{fire broke out}} in the No. 1 reactor. After a switch for a <b>spare</b> <b>electrical</b> device at the water {{processing}} facility was operated by a worker, the fire was ignited because a short circuit caused a series of hot sparks. After the fire was put out, no casualties were reported. JAPC said that there was no leakage of radiation, because the reactor was closed for inspection.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1980s the Spanish firm Esperanza y Cia {{developed}} a 120mm caliber mortar bomb which contained 21 anti-armor submunitions. What made the 120mm [...] "Espin" [...] unique was the <b>electrical</b> impact <b>fusing</b> system which totally eliminated dangerous duds. The system operates on a capacitor in each submunition which is charged by a wind generator {{in the nose}} of the projectile after being fired. If for what ever reason the <b>electrical</b> <b>fuse</b> fails to function on impact, approximately 5 minutes later the capacitor bleeds out, therefore neutralizing the submunition's electronic fuse system. Later a similar mortar round was offered in the 81mm caliber and equipped some Spanish Marine units. On signing the Wellington Declaration on Cluster Munitions, Spain withdrew both the 81mm and 120mm [...] "Espin" [...] rounds from its military units.|$|R
50|$|His name became {{widely known}} in {{connection}} with the invention and development of items of military technology, particularly the pneumatic dynamite torpedo-gun. He also invented the <b>electrical</b> <b>fuse</b> and other devices for the practical application of the weapon, and devised a method for the exact sight allowance to be made for deviation due to wind in the use of rifled artillery and small arms. Other inventions included a modified entrenching tool, a ramrod-bayonet, and a telescopic sight for artillery.|$|R
5000|$|An {{electrical}} {{fusible link}} {{is a type}} of <b>electrical</b> <b>fuse</b> that is constructed simply with a short piece of wire typically four American wire gauge sizes smaller than the wire that is being protected. For example, an AWG 16 fusible link might be used to protect AWG 12 wiring. Electrical fusible links are common in high-current automotive applications. The wire in an electrical fusible link is encased in high-temperature fire-resistant insulation to reduce hazards when the wire melts.|$|R
50|$|Unlike <b>electrical</b> <b>fuses</b> {{or circuit}} breakers, thermal fuses only react to {{excessive}} temperature {{and not to}} excessive current (unless the excessive current is sufficient to cause the thermal fuse itself to heat up to the trigger temperature). For example, in a surge protector thermal fuses may be wired in series with the varistors; when the varistors conduct, the fuse heats up and disconnects the power, which eliminates the risk of fire which can occur when the varistors are overloaded.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "fuze" [...] {{refers to}} the {{detonator}} of an explosive round or shell. The spelling is different in British English and American English (fuse/fuze respectively) and they are unrelated from a <b>fuse</b> (<b>electrical).</b> A <b>fuse</b> was earlier used to ignite the propellant (e.g., such as on a firework) until the advent of more reliable systems such as the primer or igniter that is used in most modern ammunitions.|$|R
5000|$|The {{formation}} of tears and cracks may be modeled by a random network of <b>electrical</b> <b>fuses.</b> As the electric current {{flow through the}} network is increased, some fuses may pop, but on the whole, the current is shunted around the problem areas, and uniformly distributed. However, {{at a certain point}} (at the phase transition) a cascade failure may occur, where the excess current from one popped fuse overloads the next fuse in turn, until {{the two sides of the}} net are completely disconnected and no more current flows [...]|$|R
50|$|To {{show the}} effects of {{different}} power densities on the centerline temperatures two graphs for 20 mm pellets at different power levels are shown below. It is clear that for all pellets (and most true of uranium dioxide) that for a given sized pellet that a limit must be set on the power density. It {{is likely that the}} maths used for these calculations would be used to explain how <b>electrical</b> <b>fuses</b> function and also it could be used to predict the centerline temperature in any system where heat is released throughout a cylinder shaped object.|$|R

2500|$|The most {{promising}} near-term application for weapons-rated railguns and electromagnetic guns, in general, is probably aboard naval ships with sufficient <b>spare</b> <b>electrical</b> generating capacity and battery storage space. [...] In exchange, ship survivability may be enhanced through a comparable {{reduction in the}} quantities of potentially dangerous chemical propellants and explosives currently employed. [...] Ground combat forces, however, may find that co-locating an additional electrical power supply on the battlefield for every gun system {{may not be as}} weight and space efficient, survivable, or convenient a source of immediate projectile-launching energy as conventional propellants, which are currently manufactured safely behind the lines and delivered to the weapon, pre-packaged, through a robust and dispersed logistics system.|$|R
50|$|The {{propagation}} of a tear or rip in {{a sheet of}} paper, in a sheet of metal, or even {{the formation of a}} crack in ceramic bears broad mathematical resemblance to the flow of electricity through a random network of <b>electrical</b> <b>fuses.</b> Above a certain critical point, the electrical flow will cause a fuse to pop, possibly leading to a cascade of failures, resembling the {{propagation of}} a crack or tear. The study of percolation helps indicate how the flow of electricity will redistribute itself in the fuse network, thus modeling which fuses are most likely to pop next, and how fast they will pop, and what direction the crack may curve in.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1935. It {{opened with a}} passimeter for quick sale of tickets and in the off peak {{collection}} of tickets from one side and sale from the other. A ticket collectors position was provided with stable door, now a bin store. A ticket office was also provided to deal with parcels and also had the <b>electrical</b> <b>fuses</b> and switches. Now a shop, switch room, and computer room. The station had central heating supplied by a coal boiler under the booking hall, a coal chute from a street manhole was used to supply coal. The boiler was later converted to gas, all removed when the new ticket office was built opposite for the Underground ticket system.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s the Spanish firm Esperanza y Cia, which later {{became part of}} Instalaza SA, {{developed}} a 120mm caliber mortar bomb which contained 21 dual anti-armor/fragmentation submunitions, each of which weighs 275 grams and is 37 millimeters in diameter. What made the 120mm MAT-120s submunition unique is the <b>electrical</b> impact <b>fusing</b> system which {{for all practical purposes}} totally eliminated the risk of unexploded duds from subsequently detonating. In addition there is no electrical energy stored in the MAT-120 round during storage, transport and even at the time it is fired from the mortar tube, thus greatly reducing any risk of premature detonation. The MAT-120 submunition's electronic impact fuse operates on a capacitor power source located in each submunition which is charged in flight after being fired by a wind generator located in the nose of the projectile. If for what ever reason the <b>electrical</b> <b>fuse</b> fails to function on impact, approximately 35 seconds later a self-destruction feature causes the submunition to detonate; if the self-destruction mechanism fails, in approximately 15 minutes after impact the electrical charge in the capacitor bleeds out, therefore rendering the submunition's electronic fuse system inoperative, rendering the dud submunition inert, unless the capacitor is deliberately recharged from an outside source.|$|R

30|$|Interestingly, we also {{quantified}} {{the causal}} relationships (effective connectivity) between {{three kinds of}} networks labeled according to SEEG results (i.e. the epileptogenic zone network, the propagation network and network non-involved by electrical abnormalities) [62]. Surprisingly, we found an influence of the epileptogenic network on the “non-involved” network <b>spared</b> by <b>electrical</b> abnormalities but potentially driven by epileptic regions.|$|R
40|$|International audienceFirst {{real-time}} {{studies of}} ultra-fast processes by single-bunch imaging at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility are reported. By operating the storage {{ring of the}} ESRF in single-bunch mode with its correspondingly increased electron bunch charge density per singlet, the polychromatic photon flux density at insertion-device beamlines is sufficient to capture hard X-ray images exploiting the light from a single bunch (the corresponding bunch length is 140 ps FWHM). Hard X-ray imaging with absorption contrast as well as phase contrast in combination with large propagation distances is demonstrated using spatial samplings of 11 mu m and 35 mu m pixel size. The images acquired allow one to track crack propagation in a bursting piece of glass, breaking of an <b>electrical</b> <b>fuse</b> as well as cell wall rupture in an aqueous foam.

50|$|The early 1990s {{recession}} severely {{affected the}} company, especially in its main market, Europe. The difficult situation led to Groupe Pechiney to seek divest of Carbone Lorraine's stock. In 1995, Pechiney sold a 21 percent stake to Paribas Affaires Industrielles. Carbone Lorraine was starting {{the recovery process}} and in the following years strengthened its electrical components sector by purchasing UGIMAG and Dietrich of Germany, which converted it in the European leader in electric motor's brush holders. During the next years, {{the expansion of the}} company continued, with the acquisitions of ferrite magnet divisions of Philips and ITT-Automotive and the American corrosion resistant materials' manufacturer Autocosmos. At the same time, Paribas sold its shares and the company became independent, with a large percentage of its stock on free float. It expanded the size of its operations in the United States with the acquisition of Gould Electronics' <b>electrical</b> <b>fuses</b> division (1999).|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{switching}} {{has been}} observed in carefully designed metal-insulator-metal devices built at small geometries. These devices are also commonly known as memristors and consist of specific materials such as transition metal oxides, chalcogenides, perovskites, oxides with valence defects, {{or a combination of}} an inert and an electrochemically active electrode. No simple physical device has been reported to exhibit electrical switching. We have discovered that a simple point-contact or a granular arrangement formed of metal pieces exhibits bipolar switching. These devices, referred to as coherers, were considered as one-way <b>electrical</b> <b>fuses.</b> We have identified the state variable governing the resistance state and can program the device to switch between multiple stable resistance states. Our observations render previously postulated thermal mechanisms for their resistance-change as inadequate. These devices constitute the missing canonical physical implementations for memristor, often referred as the fourth passive element. Apart from the theoretical advance in understanding metallic contacts, the current discovery provides a simple memristor to physicists and engineers for widespread experimentation, hitherto impossible...|$|R
