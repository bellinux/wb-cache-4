5|$|A mock-up was {{manufactured}} in Japan after Kawasaki won the contract. It was shipped to Singapore {{and put on}} public display during the 1984 National Exhibition held in November 1984 at World Trade Centre. The mock-up featured three choices of <b>seating</b> <b>arrangements</b> and colour schemes; {{members of the public}} were invited to give feedback on these options. The finalised interior design of the C151 trains consisted of a fully longitudinal seating arrangement. The bucket seats were made of plastic; glass partitions separated the seating areas from the passenger doors. Strap lines for standing passengers were installed in the middle of every car. The colour scheme of each adjacent car's interior is distinct to make car identification in cases of fault reporting easier for passengers. Originally the colour scheme of the driving trailer cars was orange, that of the second and fifth motor cars was blue, and that of the two centre motor cars was green. There were nine seats between two doors; this was reduced to seven after the first round of refurbishment.|$|E
40|$|Most {{of schools}} or {{universities}} use conventional or traditional <b>seating</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{in teaching and}} learning process. Sometimes, students’ chairs have little wooden palettes on one of the arms to provide a surface to write on. Sometimes, the students have desks in front of them. It has many problems to teach speaking when use these <b>seating</b> <b>arrangement.</b> These problems make some teachers or lecturers arrange the proper <b>seating</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Beside that, teacher role to manage it and conduct learning and teaching activities also have crucial part to increase students’ speaking ability. How teacher talk and behave can influence students’ ability to master the material has given. The main focus of this research is using of <b>seating</b> <b>arrangement</b> and teachers’ role in English language teaching to increase students’ speaking ability at STKIP Kumala Lampung Metro. Data came from students involving writer and an english lecturer. The research was conducted through a Classroom Action Research (CAR). The result showed that <b>seating</b> <b>arrangement</b> and teachers’ role in teaching could be used to increase students’ speaking in learning English.  The successful using of <b>seating</b> <b>arrangement</b> and teachers’ role {{can be seen from the}} students’ positive response and their active participation in speaking learning activities.

5|$|The Han {{court upheld}} a {{socio-economic}} ranking system for commoners and nobles, {{which was based}} on the twenty-ranks system installed by the statesman Shang Yang (d. 338 BCE) of the State of Qin. All males above the age of 15 (excluding slaves) could be promoted in rank up to level eight. When a commoner was promoted in rank, he was granted a more honorable place in the <b>seating</b> <b>arrangements</b> of hamlet banquets, was given a greater portion of hunted game at the table, was punished less severely for certain crimes, and could become exempt from labor service obligations to the state. This system favored the elderly, since a longer lifespan meant more opportunities to become promoted. In addition to an increase in salary (see table to the right), newly promoted men were granted wine and ox-meat for a celebratory banquet. The 19th and 20th ranks were both marquess ranks, yet only a 20th rank allowed one to have a marquessate fief.|$|E
5|$|The intense {{competition}} for congregations {{also led to}} changes to make worship more attractive that were reflected in architecture. The Church of Scotland {{was among the first}} European Protestant churches to engage in liturgical innovation reflected in <b>seating</b> <b>arrangements,</b> abandoning box pews for open benches. From {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century some of its churches, like Greyfriars in Edinburgh, began installing organs and stained glass windows, reflecting an attempt to return to forms of worship largely excluded since the late seventeenth century. At Duns the church was rebuilt (opened 1888) in a plan used in the Middle Ages, with a separate chancel, communion table at the far end, and the pulpit under the chancel arch. The influence of the ecclesiological movement can be seen in churches built at Crathie (opened 1893), which had an apsidal chancel raised above the level of the nave, a stone pulpit and a brass lectern, and St. Cuthbert's, Edinburgh (rebuilt 1894), with a marble communion table in a chancel decorated with marble and mosaic.|$|E
5|$|The only {{disagreements}} {{were over}} {{the size and}} range. The UK team was still focused on a 150-passenger design serving transatlantic routes, while the French were deliberately avoiding these. However, this proved {{not to be the}} barrier it might seem; common components could be used in both designs, with the shorter range version using a clipped fuselage and four engines, the longer one with a stretched fuselage and six engines, leaving only the wing to be extensively re-designed. The teams continued to meet through 1961, and by this time {{it was clear that the}} two aircraft would be considerably more similar in spite of different range and <b>seating</b> <b>arrangements.</b> A single design emerged that differed mainly in fuel load. More powerful Bristol Siddeley Olympus engines, being developed for the TSR-2, allowed either design to be powered by only four engines.|$|E

25|$|Roman {{society was}} graded into several citizen and non-citizen classes and ranks, {{ruled by a}} {{powerful}} minority of wealthy, landowning citizen-aristocrats. Even the lowest grade of citizenship carried certain privileges denied to non-citizens, such {{as the right to}} vote for representation in government. In tradition and law, an individual's place in the citizen-hierarchy - or outside it - should be immediately evident in their clothing.

It was constructed with maintenance requirements in mind; critical systems can be readily accessed, where possible the number of parts has been reduced, and many components have been designed for an extended lifecycle; a Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) is also equipped.

While the front doors are narrow, the aft doors are wider, having been designed to facilitate the loading of 55-gallon barrels, either upright or on their sides. The Beaver is considered a 'working' aircraft, which was designed for vigorous use. In addition to cargo, passengers can also be carried; when appropriately fitted out, the Beaver Mk.I can accommodate up to seven passengers while the more spacious Beaver Mk.III can hold a maximum of 11. Various alterations have been approved, including alternative <b>seating</b> <b>arrangements,</b> enlarged cargo doors, larger windows and smaller batteries have been approved for use.|$|E
25|$|A second graph-theoretic {{description}} {{of the problem is}} also possible. Once the women have been seated, the possible <b>seating</b> <b>arrangements</b> for the remaining men can be described as perfect matchings in a graph formed by removing a single Hamiltonian cycle from a complete bipartite graph; the graph has edges connecting open seats to men, and the removal of the cycle corresponds to forbidding the men to sit in either of the open seats adjacent to their wives. The problem of counting matchings in a bipartite graph, and therefore a fortiori the problem of computing ménage numbers, can be solved using the permanents of certain 0-1 matrices. In the case of the ménage problem, the matrices arising from this view of the problem are circulant matrices.|$|E
