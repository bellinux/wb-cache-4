500|$|The {{derailment}} {{also brought}} down the overhead line equipment {{which had to be}} replaced. Modern double-line catenary from a <b>single</b> <b>stand</b> was used for this, which reduces the risk of carriages bending if a derailment occurs, for example becoming wedged between the overhead line stanchions as seen in the Southall crash.|$|E
500|$|Despite the renovations, {{the ground}} {{did not meet}} UEFA's {{standards}} for hosting European football which meant that The New Saints were forced to play their home matches in UEFA competitions away from Park Hall. In 2008, The New Saints hoped {{to be able to}} host their UEFA Cup match against FK Sūduva Marijampolė in their first European match at Park Hall, however they missed the UEFA deadline to increase capacity. In 2009 following construction of a new stand, Park Hall was able to be used by The New Saints in UEFA competition as it reached the 1,000 seated capacity requirement. Despite Park Hall meeting UEFA standards, it has still been criticised in the media for being allowed to be used in UEFA competitions owing to its <b>single</b> <b>stand</b> and Ligaturf pitch. The pitch was referred to by the Daily Mail after The New Saints' 2010-11 UEFA Champions League match against Bohemian F.C. as a [...] "hockey pitch". The New Saints still sometimes move their home matches away from Park Hall because of capacity and financial reasons.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} stadium {{was built}} in 1913, when Woolwich Arsenal moved from the Manor Ground in Plumstead, South East London to Highbury, leasing the recreation fields of St John's College of Divinity for £20,000. The lease negotiation also agreed that no matches were to be played on [...] "holy days" [...] and that no [...] "intoxicating liquor" [...] would be sold at the stadium; however, these stipulations were dropped within a year. The stadium was hurriedly built over the summer of that year, and was designed by Archibald Leitch, architect of many other football grounds of that era. It featured a <b>single</b> <b>stand</b> {{on the eastern side}} and the other three sides had banked terracing. The new stadium cost £125,000. It opened whilst not fully complete, with Arsenal's first match of the 1913–14 season, a 2–1 Second Division win against Leicester Fosse on 6 September 1913. Leicester's Tommy Benfield scored the first goal at the new ground while George Jobey was the first Arsenal player to do so. Highbury hosted its first England match in 1920.|$|E

Bevern seems to be making a sad mess of it there. Of course he is tremendously outnumbered, thirty thousand men against eighty thousand; but he has fallen back into Silesia without making a <b>single</b> <b>stand,</b> and suffered Prince Karl to plant himself between Breslau and Schweidnitz; and the Prince is besieging the latter town with twenty thousand men, while with sixty thousand he is facing Bevern." ...|$|E

50|$|Johnson {{tested for}} {{intraspecific}} size resource utilization differences in B. pensylvanicus. In Minnesota, flowers with short corollas and long corollas existed in single and mixed species stands. Foragers with short corollas and shorter proboscises (tongue) {{were discovered in}} mixed species stands. Johnson concluded that B. pensylvanicus foragers would preference the corolla length that corresponds with their proboscis length. Further comparison of conspecific foragers of mixed versus <b>single</b> species <b>stands</b> revealed a shorter proboscis length for mixed species in comparison to <b>single</b> species <b>stand</b> for the short corolla. This study postulated that a diversity of flowering species may influence the specific bee that pollinates the species for <b>single</b> species <b>stand.</b>|$|R
