40|$|An {{electrochemical}} sensor {{for the detection}} of potentially bioavailable-copper and total copper in natural waters was prepared by adsorbing a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of L-cysteine (1 mm in 0. 05 M phosphate buffer, pH 5. 5) on the surface of a gold mini-electrode for 30 min. The modified electrode surface was stable for at least 2 days. Preconcentration of Cu(II) in phosphate buffer was held at open-circuit potential for 5 min under stirred conditions, forming a copper-cysteine complex on the electrode. Square-wave voltammetry (SWV) was performed from + 600 to - 200 mV at 75 mV s- 1 in quiescent solution after 30 s rest time; the electrochemical reaction which provided the analytical current signal was the reversible reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I). The gold-SAM L-cysteine electrode showed good sensitivity, selectivity, precision, recovery and accuracy for copper {{in the presence of a}} large amount of other metals and potential interferences. The electrochemical response was linear (R 2 = 0. 970) between zero (blank) to 0. 4 mg L- 1 Cu(II); the limit of detection and limit of quantitation were 2 and 6 μg L- 1, respectively. The performance of the electrode was tested in real samples. Diffusive gradient in thin film (DGT) devices (which were used to simulate the lipid bilayer in biological tissues) contained a filter membrane (to remove particles), a hydrogel diffusion layer and a sorption (Chelex- 100) layer, which accumulated metal ions that represented the potentially-bioavailable metal fraction [1]. DGT devices were deployed about 15 - 20 cm below the water surface for 24 - 30 hours at two sites (8 km apart) along the Dee River (Mount Morgan, Queensland, Australia) : one located upstream (at Dam No. 7) and the other downstream (at Kenbula Weir) of the decommissioned Mount Morgan Copper & Gold Mine. The accumulated copper were eluted in 1 M HNO 3 and analysed on a gold-SAM L-cysteine electrode using the developed SWV procedure. Total copper content of grab water samples from the same sites were determined by SWV and by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) or inductively coupled plasma- emission spectrometry (ICP-ES) for comparison. Dam No. 7 water samples contained 6. 0 ± 0. 9 μgL- 1 while Kenbula Weir 14800 ± 1200 μgL- 1 potentially-bioavailable Cu. These represented 80 % and 40 % of their total copper content (7. 5 ± 0. 7 and 36400 ± 280 μgL- 1, respectively). The Kenbula Weir is highly impacted by acid-mine drainage with extremely elevated copper levels relative to the Australian water quality trigger value of 8. 0 μg L- 1 [2].

40|$|Abstract In 1999, the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Canterbury started {{building}} their third electric vehicle (EV 3) {{based on a}} TOYOTA MR 2 {{with the goal of}} building a higher performance vehicle to match present combustion engined vehicles. The car is powered by 26 12 volt <b>sealed</b> <b>lead-acid</b> <b>batteries</b> connected in series to achieve a nominal 312 V DC source. A battery voltage equaliser is a device that draws energy from a higher charged battery, then discharges into a lower charged battery. The need for a voltage equaliser is principally due to the differences in cell chemistry, temperature gradients along the battery string and the ages of the batteries. During the charging or discharging process, some batteries reach their nominal voltage or reach deep discharge states before the others. Then if the charger keeps charging the batteries or the load keeps drawing energy from these batteries, it results in damage to the batteries. Therefore maintaining the charge level on each battery becomes important. In addition, it also improves the battery life and vehicle travelling range. This thesis details the analysis of three different types of battery equaliser, which are based on a 24 W buck-boost converter, 192 W buck-boost converter and 192 W flyback converter. In this design, all converters are designed to work under current mode control with average of 2 A. To make each converter install without significant effect on the performance and the cost, each converter is also built with the goals of being small, lightweight, cost effective, flexible for mounting, maintenance free and highly efficient. At the end, the prototype battery equalisation converters were designed, constructed and tested, and the efficiencies from each converter are measured around 90 ~ 92 %. The experimental results show two banks of series connected batteries can be successfully equalised by the designed equaliser. This thesis covers the design, simulation and the construction procedures of this battery equaliser system, and also details on some considerations and possible future improvement that were found during the experimental test...|$|R
