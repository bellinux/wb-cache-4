Treatment variables were row preparation, soil moisture, and planting period. Evaluation parameters were soil bulk density, air permeability, cone index, emergence rate index and total emergence, and plant dry matter weight. The experiments were conducted in somewhat poorly drained soils near Ames, Iowa. The fields were not cultivated before planting and the residue {{from the previous year}} 2 ̆ 7 s corn was removed. Experiments were conducted in two cropping seasons. Each experiment consisted of a factorial design of three coulter treatments, three moisture ranges and three planting periods. Crop growing seasons were divided into three planting periods. Treatments were replicated three times using a split-split design. After planting in the field, undisturbed soil blocks were removed and transferred to growth chambers. Soil blocks were not watered and left for 28 days at 21 ° to see the plant shoot and root responses. Triple coulter produced lowest bulk density, lowest penetration resistance, and highest permeability in both the field and growth chamber experiments. In clay loam soil field experiments, the triple coulter seed placement was deeper and this treatment resulted in slower emergence and lower plant dry weight 42 days after planting than the other two row preparation treatments. In the growth chamber experiment, triple coulter had lower dry shoot weight and lower dry weight of roots in the furrow than the other two row treatments. In loam soil, triple coulter generally had faster emergence in cold and wet soil conditions and produced the highest plant dry matter weights 28 and 42 days after planting in the field experiment.

50|$|The general {{horizontal}} {{outline of}} Morocconites is a bar {{about twice as}} long as wide, with approximately parallel sides and rounded front and back ends. The horizontal outline of the head (or cephalon) is pentangular, with a long upcurved frontal medial spine. At the axis, the cephalon takes up about 3 tenths of the total body length. The horizontal outline of the raised part of the cephalon is approximately parabolic. The central area of the cephalon, that is separated from the eye area by a lateral furrow, is called glabella. Posteriorly, a left to right <b>furrow</b> <b>singles</b> off the occipital ring. This furrow is deep laterally and shallower near the axis. In front of the occipital ring the glabella is divided by deep furrows into three pairs of lateral lobes and a frontal lobe, but these furrows do not cross the axis. The most posterior of the three lateral lobes is bluntly triangular. The other lateral lobes look like match heads, the anterior one larger and stretching out further from the axis. The frontal lobe is mushroom-shaped. It has schizochroal eyes with 26 vertical rows (or files), each containing 5 or rarely 6 lenses per file, except for a few files with less lenses at the front and back edge of the eye. The posterior margin of the cephalon progressively curves backwards laterally to about 60˚ with the axis. There is no genal spine, in fact, the genal angle is gently rounded. Its body (or thorax) has 11 articulating segments, like most Phacopina. The axis is about ¼ of the width of the thorax and lightly convex (transversely). The side lobes (or pleural lobes) do not end in spines, but are gently rounded, and the margin of the tail piece (or pygidium) is entire, two features it shares with both other Acastinae and Phacopidae. The pygidium takes up about ¼ of the total body length. The axis of the pygidium is divided in about 9 recognisable segments. The furrows of the 5 most anterior segments are deep laterally, but very shallow in the middle third. The furrows between the posterior pygidial segments are faint, while segmentation in the pleural region of the pygidium is barely discernable.|$|R

40|$|Signaling by the centrosomal asters and spindle midzone coordinately directs {{formation}} of the cytokinetic furrow. Here, we explore {{the contribution of the}} asters by analyzing the consequences of altering interaster distance during the first cytokinesis of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. Delaying aster separation, by using TPXL- 1 depletion to shorten the metaphase spindle, leads to a corresponding delay in furrow formation, but results in a <b>single</b> <b>furrow</b> that ingresses at a normal rate. Preventing aster separation, by simultaneously inhibiting TPXL- 1 and G signaling-based cortical forces pulling on the asters, delays furrow formation and leads to the {{formation of}} multiple furrows that ingress toward the midzone. Disrupting midzone-based signaling, by depleting conserved midzone complexes, results in a converse phe-notype: neither the timing nor the number of furrows is affected, but the rate of furrow ingression is decreased threefold. Simultaneously delaying aster separation and disrupting midzone-based signaling leads to complete failure of furrow formation. Based on these results, we propose that signaling by the separated asters executes two critical functions: 1) it couples furrow formation to anaphase onset by concentrating contractile ring proteins on the equatorial cortex in a midzone-independent manner and 2) it subsequently refines spindle midzone-based signaling to restrict furrowing to a single site...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundAfter anaphase, the {{segregated}} chromosomes are sequestered by cytokinesis into two separate daughter cells by a cleavage furrow {{formed by the}} actomyosin-based contractile ring. The failure to properly position the contractile ring between {{the segregated}} chromosomes can result in aneuploidy. In both C. elegans embryos and human cells, the central spindle regulates division-plane positioning in parallel with a second pathway that involves astral microtubules. ResultsWe combined genetic and pharmacological manipulations with live cell imaging to spatially separate the two division cues in a single cell. We demonstrate that the two pathways for furrow formation are mechanistically and genetically distinct. By following the distribution of green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged nonmuscle myosin, {{we have found that}} the astral pathway for furrow formation involves the negative regulation of cortical myosin recruitment. An asymmetrically positioned spindle induces the asymmetric cortical accumulation of myosin. This cortical myosin behaves as a coherent contractile network. If the cortical network is nonuniform over the cell, the cortical contractile elements coalesce into a <b>single</b> <b>furrow.</b> This coalescence requires interconnections among contractile elements.

40|$|Cytokinesis is {{the final}} step of the cell {{division}} that physically separates a single cell into two daughter cells following chromosome segregation. In order to insure that each daughter cell receives the proper genetic complement, cytokinesis must be both spatially and temporally coupled to chromosome segregation. Cytokinesis is accomplished by formation and constriction of a contractile ring made up of actin, myosin, anillin, and the septins. One of the critical questions {{in the field is}} how does the cell maintain precise spatial and temporal control over the assembly and constriction of the contractile ring? Although the precise molecular signals are still being debated, it is known that signals from the anaphase spindle are critical for furrow formation and ingression. Using the early C. elegans embryo I have found that integration of signals from astral microtubules and the spindle midzone is critical for the formation of a <b>single</b> <b>furrow</b> during cytokinesis. During early anaphase, astral microtubules provide an inhibitory signal to prevent accumulation of contractile ring proteins in the anterior and posterior of the cell, leading to their enrichment in the equatorial region. Proper separation of the asters is important for this early signal, since delaying or preventing aster separation disrupts the equatorial enrichment of anillin and myosin and delays furrow formation. Following this initial signal from the astral microtubules, a positive signal from the midzone - mediated by Centralspindlin and the Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC) - drives furrow ingression and completion. Although the initial patterning of contractility and the timing of furrow formation are unaffected, depletion of Centralspindlin or the CPC leads to a decrease in the rate of ingression and failure of cytokinesis. My work has also shown that Centralspindlin and the CPC are involved in distinct pathways to promote furrow ingression. The key role of the Centralspindlin complex is to inactivate the small GTPase, Rac, whereas the role of the CPC is likely through promoting contractile ring disassembly through regulation of anillin and/or septi...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine whether the irrigation of a furrowed field when water supplies are limited could be managed to increase field corn yield (Zea mays L) while conserving water. Strategies of delaying the first irrigation of the season, multiple irrigations, and dryland farming techniques were evaluated for their effects on total water use and field corn yield through use of simulation. To model deficit irrigation it was necessary to develop and verify a two dimensional infiltration model that considered the effect of surface sealing and soil cracking. The infiltration model was verified with field data taken at Mead, NE for a silty clay loam soil. It was found that the output from the developed model better matched field data when cracks were considered in the simulations than when they were not. The irrigation simulations consisted of combining three models: an infiltration model, a surface irrigation model and a crop model CERES-MAIZE. The crop model simulated the water extraction from the soil by the roots. The drying produced cracking of the soil, which was considered by the infiltration model. The surface irrigation model simulated the water distribution along a <b>single</b> <b>furrow.</b> The crop model predicted yield across the irrigated field. A case study for a Cozad silt loam soil located in western Nebraska was used to evaluate the simulation of these strategies. ^ For the year 1986, which represents an average rainfall year, it was found that it was better to start irrigation when the soil deficit was 50 %, to irrigate two times, to encourage runoff and to use a reuse pit. It was concluded for this case study that when water is limited the best irrigation strategy is to irrigate the whole field and allow runoff because the last irrigation of the season can then be avoided. A reuse pit is necessary to contain runoff and conserve water. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to compare the {{performance}} and the costs of alternative tillage systems and machinery, in both energy and economic terms. To determine the energy requirements of tillage implements, experimentation in field conditions and controlled laboratory was conducted. Costs of alternative implements and complete systems were analysed. The field experiment was undertaken to determine the performance of tillage implements in real conditions. Draught force and area of disturbance of the implements were measured and specific resistance calculated. The implements involved in the experiment were 4 furrow mouldboard plough, 3 furrow disc plough, disc harrow and 7 winged tines. The mouldboard plough was operating at two different depths. Two tractors were used for execution of the implement and the wheel slip was measured. The soil bin studies were conducted in additional evaluation of the implements. The laboratory conditions ensure the uniformity of each test. The experiment was carried out to determine draught force, area of disturbance and specific resistance. The experiment involved <b>single</b> <b>furrow</b> mouldboard plough, disc plough, disc harrow and winged tines. Winged tines were made up of four different wing widths. Finally, an economic cost calculator was developed to compare the costs of different implements and tillage systems. Technical parameters and current prices of the implements were obtained from the manufacturers. The results from the field experiment show that there is a similar draught force per unit implement for mouldboard and disc ploughs, while draught force of mouldboard plough is significantly higher. The tillage efficiency of all implements is similar, with a mean of specific resistance of 58 kN/m 2 and a range of 15 kN/m 2. In the soil bin the vertical force preventing penetration occurred for disc plough and disc harrow. The specific resistance of the mouldboard plough had the lowest value, while the specific resistance of disc plough was higher by a factor of 1. 65. By increasing the wing width of the tines the draught force was increased but the specific resistance decreased. Comparing the costs of complete tillage systems it was observed that minimum tillage decreases the operational cost per hectare by 30 % compared to a conventional system based on ploughing. Direct drilling is the cheapest way to establish a crop, but if herbicide has to be applied the cost per hectare {{is similar to that of}} minimum tillage. The costs of different sizes (102, 162, 224 kW tractors) of alternative tillage systems are similar.
