In 1963, the first prototype, XP831, publicly crashed at the Paris Air Show; the accident had been caused by a <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> dirt in the air feed lines of the nozzle control motor, which had caused the engine nozzles to stick. XP831 was later fully repaired and resumed development flying. All the pilots involved survived.|$|E
5|$|Reaching the cascade, {{or rather}} cataract, the roaring {{of which had}} a long time {{announced}} its vicinity, my soul was hurried by the falls into a new train of reflections. The impetuous dashing of the rebounding torrent from the dark cavities which mocked the exploring eye, produced an equal activity in my mind: my thoughts darted from earth to heaven, and I asked myself why I was chained to life and its misery? Still the tumultuous emotions this sublime object excited, were pleasurable; and, viewing it, my soul rose, with renewed dignity, above its cares – grasping at immortality – it seemed as impossible to stop the current of my thoughts, as of the always varying, still the same, torrent before me – I stretched out my hand to eternity, bounding over the dark <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> life to come.|$|E

On 30 December of the same year, a young Bolivian named Ugo Ungaza Villegas threw a rock at the painting; this resulted in the loss of a <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> pigment near the left elbow, which was later painted over.|$|E
25|$|Owing to {{the immense}} {{popularity}} of the victim there was exceptional outrage from the public, who were impatient for a conviction. In the absence of other suspects, George attracted police attention because many elements in his background seemed to point to his guilt, although the only actual evidence was a tiny <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> material {{that may or may}} not have been gunshot residue. He was convicted of murder, but his conviction was subsequently judged unsafe by the Court of Appeal and was quashed in 2007. After a retrial, he was acquitted on 1 August 2008, though his claims for compensation for wrongful imprisonment were dismissed.|$|E

He also wrote that [...] "out of the cruelty and stupidity of the Old Russia nothing could ever emerge, but (...) beneath the cruelty and stupidity of the New Russia a <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> the ideal may lie hid", which together with other comments may be construed as anti-Russian and antisemitic.|$|E

Beholder's dam, Leslie's Lady, won five races out of 28 starts, including the listed Hoosier Debutante Stakes in 1998, and was purchased by Mitchell in 2006 for $100,000. Leslie's Lady was a descendant of the broodmare Last Bird, making her a distant relative of the Kentucky Derby winner I'll Have Another. Beholder's older half-brother, Into Mischief (sired by Harlan's Holiday), won the 2007 CashCall Futurity and the 2008 Damascus Stakes.

The resulting MacPherson inquiry found that the Met was [...] "institutionally racist". Two men, Gary Dobson and David Norris, were convicted on 3 January 2012 for their role in Lawrence's murder. Their trial was based on newly discovered forensic evidence, following a cold case review in 2007 thar found a tiny <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> Lawrence's blood on a jacket belonging to Dobson and one of Lawrence's hairs on trousers belonging to Norris. The pair were sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 15 years 2 months for Dobson and 14 years 3 months for Norris. In June 2013, the Met were exposed for sending an undercover officer to smear the friends and family of Stephen Lawrence.|$|E
2500|$|Once Planck had {{discovered}} the empirically fitting function, he constructed a physical derivation of this law. His thinking revolved around entropy rather than being directly about temperature. Planck considered a cavity with perfectly reflective walls; the cavity contained finitely many hypothetical well separated and recognizable but identically constituted, of definite magnitude, resonant oscillatory bodies, several such oscillators at each of finitely many characteristic frequencies. The hypothetical oscillators were for Planck purely imaginary theoretical investigative probes, and he said of them that such oscillators {{do not need to}} [...] "really exist somewhere in nature, provided their existence and their properties are consistent with the laws of thermodynamics and electrodynamics.". Planck did not attribute any definite physical significance to his hypothesis of resonant oscillators, but rather proposed it as a mathematical device that enabled him to derive a single expression for the black body spectrum that matched the empirical data at all wavelengths. He tentatively mentioned the possible connection of such oscillators with atoms. In a sense, the oscillators corresponded to Planck's <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> carbon; the size of the speck could be small regardless {{of the size of the}} cavity, provided the speck effectively transduced energy between radiative wavelength modes.|$|E
