50|$|When a <b>servient</b> <b>estate</b> exists but the servient owner {{cannot be}} determined, {{and where the}} law allows, a {{dominant}} owner may be granted a servitude right a non domino, i.e. absent the servient owner. In this event, the dominant owner will generally not be indemnified by the land registry for the statutory prescriptive period.|$|E
50|$|A {{dominant}} estate is the parcel of real property {{that has an}} easement over another piece of property (the <b>servient</b> <b>estate).</b> The type of easement involved is almost always an appurtenant easement. Likewise, it is almost always an affirmative easement, that is, one that permits a person to do something. Estate is a common law concept.|$|E
50|$|Brachtenbach, {{while sitting}} as a Washington State Supreme Court Justice, wrote the opinion for Brown v. Voss, 105 Wash.2d 366, 715 P.2d 514 (1986). The issue in Voss was: {{to what extent}} can the owner of a private road {{easement}} traverse the <b>servient</b> <b>estate</b> to not only reach the dominant estate, but a parcel (subsequently acquired by the dominant estate owner) adjacent to the dominant estate when such usage does not increase the burden on the <b>servient</b> <b>estate?</b> While Brachtenbach stated the general rule that an easement appurtenant to one parcel of land may not be extended by the owner of the dominant estate to an additional non-dominant parcel owned by the owner of the dominant estate regardless of whether the additional parcel is adjacent to the dominant estate, and further declared that if an easement appurtenant serves a particular parcel of land, any extension of the easement is a misuse of the easementâ€”Brachtenbach still ultimately allowed the owner of the dominant estate to continue using the easement to access the additional, non-dominant estate because a grant of injunctive relief would be inappropriate in light of the circumstances. In short, Brachtenbach essentially found in favor of the Plaintiff by not granting the defendant injunctive relief (i.e. preventing the owner of the dominant estate to continue to use the easement to access the adjacent non-dominant estate) although the plaintiff unlawfully extended the easement. Brachtenbach rationalized that a grant of injunctive relief under the circumstances would be inappropriate and against the principles of equity because (while no additional harm to the <b>servient</b> <b>estate</b> resulted from the extension of the easement) if injunctive relief was in fact given to the defendant, it would only serve to harm the plaintiff while not providing any benefit or protection to the defendant.|$|E
50|$|A {{servitude}} is {{a qualified}} beneficial interest severed or fragmented from {{the ownership of}} an inferior property (<b>servient</b> <b>estate)</b> and attached to a superior property (dominant estate) or to some person (personal beneficiary) other than the owner. At civil law, ownership (dominium) is the only full real right whereas a servitude is a subordinate real right on par with wayleaves, real burdens (i.e. real covenants), security interests, and reservations. There are two types: predial, attaching to property, and personal, attaching to a person.|$|E
50|$|The lower Land Court {{ruled against}} M.P.M. The Massachusetts Supreme Court {{ruled that the}} Land Court {{correctly}} applied existing law, but that the standard for unilateral relocation of an easement by {{the owner of a}} <b>servient</b> <b>estate</b> in the Restatement Third of Servitudes was better suited to modern times. The Restatement allowed for unilateral relocation of the easement if it did not lessen the utility of the easement, increase the burdens on the owner of the easement, or frustrate the purpose of the easement. The court noted that this may often call for a hearing to determine what would constitute a reasonable relocation.|$|E
5000|$|A predial (Brit. praedial) {{servitude}} is an incorporeal hereditament burdening a <b>servient</b> <b>estate</b> (praedium serviens) for {{the benefit}} of a dominant estate (praedium dominans) to protect the holder in his own rights to the use or enjoyment of property. The two estates must belong to different bare title holders (dominus nudea proprietatis, i.e. fee simple owners). This type of servitude may only burden immovable property (i.e. real property).

40|$|Abstract. Trefzger and Munneke (1998) {{present a}} {{theoretical}} model, where the surplus that an easement {{gives rise to}} will be split equally between the parties. We provide experimental evidence from Sweden indicating that the split of the surplus depends on the context and what is judged to be reasonable principles of a fair distribution. The dominant estates got a significantly higher share of the surplus because they could start the bargaining with a bid that only included compensation for cost, whereas the <b>servient</b> <b>estate</b> could not find any principle that would give them the whole surplus. After these initial asymmetric bids, the parties usually met halfway...|$|E
