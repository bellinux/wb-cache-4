5|$|From a low base at the {{beginning}} of the sixteenth century, trade expanded in the 1530s, but suffered from the English invasions of the Rough Wooing in the 1540s. From the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland experienced a decline in demand for exports of cloth and wool to the continent. Scots responded by selling larger quantities of traditional goods, increasing the output of salt, herring and coal. The fortunes of Scottish burghs in the export trade changed across the century. Haddington, which had been one of the major centres of trade in the late Medieval period, saw its share of foreign exports collapse in the sixteenth century. Aberdeen's <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> remained stable for most of the century, but slumped in the last decade. The small Fife ports grew in significance and Edinburgh took an increasing <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> through its port of Leith.

25|$|Prior to Krugman's work, trade theory (see David Ricardo and Heckscher–Ohlin model) {{emphasized}} trade {{based on}} the comparative advantage of countries with very different characteristics, such as {{a country with a}} high agricultural productivity trading agricultural products for industrial products from a country with a high industrial productivity. However, in the 20th century, an ever-larger <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> occurred between countries with similar characteristics, which is difficult to explain by comparative advantage. Krugman's explanation of trade between similar countries was proposed in a 1979 paper in the Journal of International Economics, and involves two key assumptions: that consumers prefer a diverse choice of brands, and that production favors economies of scale. Consumers' preference for diversity explains the survival of different versions of cars like Volvo and BMW. However, because of economies of scale, it is not profitable to spread the production of Volvos all over the world; instead, it is concentrated in a few factories and therefore in a few countries (or maybe just one). This logic explains how each country may specialize in producing a few brands of any given type of product, instead of specializing in different types of products.|$|E
