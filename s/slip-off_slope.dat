50|$|On {{the inside}} of a meander is a gentle slope of sedementation {{referred}} to as the <b>slip-off</b> <b>slope.</b> It is often marked by a point bar in the river.|$|E
50|$|Helicoidal flow is a {{contributing}} factor {{to the formation of}} <b>slip-off</b> <b>slopes</b> and river cliffs in a meandering section of the river. The helicoidal motion of the flow aids the processes of hydraulic action and corrasion {{on the outside of the}} meander, and sweeps sediment across the floor of the meander towards the inside of the meander, forming point bar deposits.|$|R
40|$|Although {{flooding}} and the highly dynamic geomorphology influence ecophysiology {{of trees in}} Amazonian white-water forests (várzea), information {{about the extent of}} these environmental conditions on distribution and richness of tree species is scarce. To better understand dynamic of natural forest succession and the development of different várzea forest types, we inventoried structure and floristic composition of trees ≥ 10 cm DBH in a total area of 5. 24 ha in várzea forests near Tefé and near Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. The forests were of different successional stages and situated on different sites along the flood-level gradient. Topography and average inundation of all inventoried trees was measured with a theodolite. Sedimentation was recorded during the aquatic phase 2000 and the soil texture in each site determined. The low-várzea forests were composed of different successional stages subjected to annual floods between 7 and 3 m. Stand density per hectare averaged 490 individuals in the early successional stage, up to 1000 individuals in the early secondary stage and 434 individuals in the late successional stage, species richness amounted to 4, 45 and 91 tree species, respectively. The high-várzea forests were late successional stages subjected to annual inundations above 3 m. Stand density per hectare averaged 407 individuals and species richness amounted to 68 species in a frequently exploited forest near Manaus and to 172 species in a undisturbed forest near Tefé. Species richness and distribution along the gradients of {{flooding and}} sedimentation was well defined. Only 2. 6 % of 222 recorded tree species occurred over the whole flood-level gradient. Sedimentation was highest in the early successional stages near the <b>slip-off</b> <b>slopes</b> of the main-river channels, and decreased with increasing topographic level of the forested sites and proceeding succession, reaching lowest rates in the high-várzea forests. Simultaneously, soil texture changed from coarse-grained soils in early stages to fine-grained soils in subsequent stages. Thus, natural succession in várzea forests is linked to the biogenical induced silting up of the sites, because dunes and large stems building trees slow down water energy and favour the deposition of fine grained sediment. A special vegetation unit within the low várzea is the ‘chavascal’, a species-poor swamp forest, which establishes in the marginal zone of lakes or in ancient silted up river arms. Since it is located off the direct influence of the main-river channels, it seems to be characterised by longstanding stable environmental conditions, and therefore cannot rank with the successional sequence near the highly dynamic river system...|$|R
40|$|Martian valley {{networks}} {{have been cited}} as the best evidence that Mars maintained flow of liquid water across its surface. Although internal structures associated with a fluvial origin within valleys such as inner channels, terraces, <b>slip-off</b> and undercut <b>slopes</b> are extremely rare on Mars (Carr and Malin, 2000) such features can be identified in highresolution imagery (e. g. Malin and Edgett, 2001; Jaumann et al., 2005). However, besides internal features the source regions are an important indicator for the flow processes in Martian valleys because they define the drainage area and thus constrain the amount of available water for eroding the valley network. Furthermore, the morphology of the source regions and their topographic characteristics provide information {{about the origin of}} the water. On Mars valley networks are thought to have been formed by retreating erosion where the water is supplied from the sub-surface. However, the mechanisms that are responsible for the release of ground water are poorly understood. The three-dimensional highly resolved data of the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on the Mars Express Mission (Jaumann et al., 2007) allow the detailed examination of valley network source regions...|$|R
50|$|Deposition on the <b>slip-off</b> <b>slope</b> occurs {{due to the}} helical flow in {{meandering}} reaches that {{is constantly}} transferring sediment from the undercut slope {{on the outside of}} the meanders to the inside river banks.|$|E
50|$|North of the Kniebreche on {{both sides}} of the river are more {{historic}} sites. On the right hand bank is the ruined Nidberg Castle on the crags of the Löwenkopffelsen that rise 50 metres above the valley floor, and the deserted village of Schwedengraben, an old mining settlement, on a <b>slip-off</b> <b>slope</b> of the river valley.|$|E
5000|$|A {{point bar}} is a depositional feature made of {{alluvium}} that accumulates {{on the inside}} bend of streams and rivers below the <b>slip-off</b> <b>slope.</b> Point bars are found in abundance in mature or meandering streams. They are crescent-shaped and located {{on the inside of}} a stream bend, being very similar to, though often smaller than, towheads, or river islands.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>slip-off</b> <b>slope</b> is {{the inside}} bank of a meander on a river where {{sedimentary}} material is deposited {{as a result}} of the slower flow rate. It is on the opposite side of the channel to a river-cut cliff or cut bank which is formed by the erosive forces of the stronger current on that side. The terms are used in connexion with the formation of meanders on a river.|$|E
50|$|A cut bank, {{also known}} as a river cliff or river-cut cliff, is the outside bank of a water channel (stream), which is {{continually}} undergoing erosion. Cut banks are found in abundance along mature or meandering streams, they are located on the outside of a stream bend, known as a meander, opposite the <b>slip-off</b> <b>slope</b> {{on the inside of the}} bend. They are shaped much like a small cliff, and are formed by the erosion of soil as the stream collides with the river bank. As opposed to a point bar which is an area of deposition, a cut bank is an area of erosion.|$|E
50|$|Most meanders {{occur in}} the region of a river channel with shallow gradients, a {{well-developed}} floodplain, and cohesive floodplain material. Deposition of sediment occurs on the inner edge, because the secondary flow of the river sweeps and rolls sand, rocks and other submerged objects across the bed of the river towards the inside radius of the river bend, creating a point bar below the <b>slip-off</b> <b>slope.</b> Meandering morphology is dependent upon similar bank erosion and bar growth rates. Erosion is greater {{on the outside of the}} bend where the soil is not protected by deposits of sand and rocks. The current on the outside bend is more effective in eroding the unprotected soil, and the inside bend receives steadily increasing deposits of sand and rocks, and the meander tends to grow in the direction of the outside bend, forming a small cliff called a cut bank. This can be seen in areas where willows grow on the banks of rivers; on the inside of meanders, willows are often far from the bank, whilst on the outside of the bend, the roots of the willows are often exposed and undercut, eventually leading the trees to fall into the river. This demonstrates the river's movement. Slumping usually occurs on the concave sides of the banks resulting in mass movements such as slides.|$|E
40|$|The North Sea Basin {{is shaped}} by {{multiple}} glacial advances and retreats that left complex sequences of glacio-fluvial and sub-glacial deposits, cut by sub-glacial tunnel valleys. Today, the submerged valley of the Elbe forms {{one of the most}} prominent structures of the southern North Sea. Flanked by huge moraine deposits of older glacials, the valley developed to its present form during the Weichselian sea-level lowstand (- 130 m below present). Melt waters that discharged in north-westerly directions along the Scandinavian Ice Sheet fed the paleo Elbe at that time. During the Holocene the valley drowned in the rising sea. Here we present an area-wide high-resolution map of the seafloor and high-resolution shallow seismic data covering 1, 600 km 2 of the paleo Elbe valley (PEV) including its eastern levee. The data allow to shed new light on the PEV development including the historical process of sedimentary infill with the successive Holocene sea level rise in detail. Shallow seismic data with transect distances of 400 m and several cross sections allow 3 -D visualization. The eastern flank of the valley is characterized by a relatively steep slope with one or more terraces. At its levee a significant sediment change is present on the modern sea floor, representing moraine and marine deposits. High resolution sidescan sonar data of this area show a much higher heterogeneity and complexity in sediment and habitat distribution as assumed before. Holocene marine sediments form a patchy and thin drape east of the valley floor. The western <b>slip-off</b> <b>slope</b> of the valley slope is much smoother than the eastern undercut slope. As yet, significant sedimentological changes at the present seafloor are not known for the western side of the PEV. Shallow seismic data show the base of the PEV. There are conspicuous internal seismic reflectors above the base, inclined in northeastern direction. They indicate a sedimentary infill of the valley from the southwest when the southern part of the Dogger Bank was flooded during the early Holocene sea-level rise. In this process the steeper eastern slope acted as a natural barrier towards the northeast and averted sediment transport beyond the eastern boundary of the PEV...|$|E
