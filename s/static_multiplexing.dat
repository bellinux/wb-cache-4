40|$|The {{research}} results upon {{the application of}} the existing information transmission methods in polymodal info communication systems are presented herein. The analysis of the existing commutation ways and multiplexing schemes has revealed that modern means of telecommunication are capable of providing polymodal information delivery with the required quality to the customer correspondent terminal. Under these conditions substantial capacity resource consumption in the data transmission networks with a simultaneous <b>static</b> time <b>multiplexing</b> is required, however, it is easier to achieve the modality synchronization within that kind of an infrastructure. The data networks with a <b>static</b> time <b>multiplexing</b> demand employing more sophisticated supporting algorithms of the guaranteed data blocks delivery quality. However, due to the stochastic data blocks delays modality synchronizing during the off-line processing is more difficult to provide. Nowadays there are objective preconditions for a data networking realization which is invariable to the applied transmission technology. This capability is defined by a wide (person-to-person) application of the optical technologies in the transport infrastructure of the polymodal info communication systems. In case of the availability of the customer terminal and networking functioning matching mode it becomes possible to organize channels in the latter which can adaptively select the most effective networking technology according to the current volume allocation and modality types in the messages...|$|R

In this paper we use records of player activities in the massive multiplayer online game Pardus over 1, 238 consecutive days, and analyze dynamical features of sequences of actions of players. We build on previous work were temporal structures of human actions of the same type were quantified, and extend provide an empirical understanding of human actions of different types. This study of multi-level human activity {{can be seen as}} a dynamic counterpart of <b>static</b> <b>multiplex</b> network analysis. We show that the interevent time distributions of actions in the Pardus universe follow highly non-trivial distribution functions, from which we extract action-type specific characteristic "decay constants". We discuss characteristic features of interevent time distributions, including periodic patterns on different time scales, bursty dynamics, and various functional forms on different time scales. We comment on gender differences of players in emotional actions, and find that while male and female act similarly when performing some positive actions, females are slightly faster for negative actions. We also observe effects on the age of players: more experienced players are generally faster in making decisions about engaging and terminating in enmity and friendship, respectively.

In this case a stable uniform photo-alignment {{on one of the}} cell substrates spreads out to the other, which is prepared to sustain planar alignment with a degenerate azimuthal direction. In the paper, a thin polyimide film was involved to improve smoothness of planar substrate, resulting in the better electrooptical properties of FLC display.

40|$|Granulomas play a {{key role}} in host {{protection}} against mycobacterial pathogens, with their breakdown contributing to exacerbated disease. To better understand the initiation and maintenance of these structures, we employed both high-resolution <b>multiplex</b> <b>static</b> imaging and intravital multiphoton microscopy of Mycobacterium bovis BCG-induced liver granulomas. We found that Kupffer cells directly capture blood-borne bacteria and subsequently nucleate formation of a nascent granuloma by recruiting both uninfected liver-resident macrophages and blood-derived monocytes. Within the mature granuloma, these myeloid cell populations formed a relatively immobile cellular matrix that interacted with a highly dynamic effector T cell population. The efficient recruitment of these T cells was highly dependent on TNF-alpha-derived signals, which also maintained the granuloma structure through preferential effects on uninfected macrophage populations. By characterizing the migration of both innate and adaptive immune cells throughout the process of granuloma development, these studies provide a new perspective on the cellular events involved in mycobacterial containment and escape...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, photo-aligned {{ferroelectric}} {{liquid crystal}} displays based on azo-dye layer are investigated. A remarkable property of such azo-dye is pure reorientation of the molecular absorption oscillator perpendicular to the UV light polarization, without any photochemical transformations. This property makes it suitable to provide a high photo-alignment quality of FLC using the azo-dye layer. The mechanism of azo-dye photo-alignment process is explained with a specific potential, which characterizes the interactions of the dye molecules and the activated UV light. Both the approximations of negligible and strong molecular interaction are considered {{during the process of}} reorientation under the action of a polarized light. The reorientation ordering of azo-dye increases with the exposure time and comes to a saturation level; such saturation value increases with the intensity of the activated light. A non-zero order parameter relaxation is observed when the activating light switched off, which is caused by dye molecular interaction. The properties of photo-aligned azo-dyes would be presented. The azo-dyes shows remarkable properties, including high order parameter, good thermostability, high anchoring energy, pretilt angle generation and high voltage holding ratio. A photo-aligned FLC with a bistable switching are discussed in <b>static</b> and <b>multiplex</b> operations. Optimization of photo-aligned FLC display is investigated, including the effects of UV exposure energy, photo-aligned/planar layer quality and boundary conditions.

40|$|Abstract—This paper investigates several {{schemes to}} improve the {{performance}} of the enhanced Physical Downlink Control Channel (ePDCCH) in Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTEA) networks by means of Intercell Interference Coordination (ICIC). Given the flexible design of the ePDCCH, based on frequency division <b>multiplexing,</b> <b>static</b> ICIC techniques such as Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR) can be applied and hence, performance degradations at cell edges can be avoided in contrast to its antecesor, the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) in LTE. The study is focused in realistic/irregular deployments, where the amount of intercell interference received at different cells varies considerably making very difficult the task of homogenizing {{the performance of the}} ePDCCH over the coverage area. In order to address this problem, the proposed multiobjective scheme adjusts the configuration of SFR at cell level. The problem formulation includes several performance metrics including spectral efficiency, cell edge performance, consumption/ amount of control resources and energy requirements. The results reveal that the proposed scheme is able to (1) reduce the average consumption of control resources and, (2) minimize energy needs without penalizing the capacity of data channels.

40|$|In this digital era, {{the usage}} of smart phones and mobile devices is {{becoming}} a norm in society with mobile communication quickly transitioned from voice oriented transmission to picture transmission to a more complex live video streaming. This latest development has demanded more capacity and higher bandwidth in communication links. Static links, which {{are the focus of}} this thesis, {{are an integral part of}} this mobile system in delivering high capacity data transmission using backhauls or nomadic links. Multi polarised antennas with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiplexing can be employed to greatly enhance the capacity of a mobile system, especially at frequencies lower than 6 GHz, using their compact size. A practical antenna inherently exhibits elliptical polarisation though it may be designed to form linear or circular polarisation. Little attention has been given to this aspect of polarised waves as they have always been deemed as unwanted polarisation, although in practice, any antenna is elliptically polarised as it can never be perfectly circularly or linearly polarised. This work therefore aims to deliberately exploit this opportunity by forming antennas with elliptical polarisation to identify the advantages of doing so in order to improve orthogonality in comparison with linear polarisation. It was found that in order to achieve perfect orthogonality, it was more practical to set the magnitudes and phases of the co-polar and cross-polar linear components, which resulted in an improved co to cross polar ratio more than 20 dB better than linear polarisation in free space. A dual elliptically polarised antenna prototype was designed and evaluated in this work, which was evaluated both in free space and within an indoor measurement campaign. Results concluded that at short distances with low scattering in the channel and directional antennas, elliptically polarised antennas provide improved multiplexing gain over dual linear polarisations.
