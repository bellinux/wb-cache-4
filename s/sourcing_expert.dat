40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to examine what {{considerations}} journalists take {{regarding the use of}} <b>expert</b> <b>sources,</b> specifically in the health sections of Danish breakfast and morning newspapers. Furthermore, the thesis discusses the way in which journalists, through the choice of <b>expert</b> <b>sources,</b> can help to shape the public perception of a given case or situation and how this ability can be problematic. The thesis finds that the majority of those journalists surveyed believe that a good health expert is, first and foremost, an available source. In addition, he must be able to articulate difficult material in an easily accessible manner and have great knowledge in the health area, as the journalist would like to know as much as possible in order to be objective in their assessments of the specific case. Reporters have deadlines they must comply with. Therefore, it is smart if they can find <b>expert</b> <b>sources</b> that meet their criteria for a good <b>expert</b> <b>source,</b> as it makes their work easier and saves time. In this context, the thesis finds that journalists in general, including health journalism, to a certain extent repeatedly use the same <b>expert</b> <b>source.</b> This calls into question the nuances and validity of health articles, since some arguments may never appear in the media spotlight as <b>expert</b> <b>sources</b> holding other positions may never be heard. Furthermore, <b>expert</b> <b>sources</b> can have substantial interests in promoting certain views over others. Surveyed journalists are well aware of this danger, but some of the journalists in this context doubt their own abilities to be critical of <b>expert</b> <b>sources.</b> Thus this thesis concludes that journalists writing about health may be better served by taking a more critical approach to <b>expert</b> <b>sources,</b> as well as using several experts to capture a more complete picture of health issues...|$|R

Lastly, rational postulates for our merging operator are studied...|$|R

40|$|This study {{suggests}} that online source types (typical consumer vs. <b>expert</b> <b>source)</b> can induce differential effects on two dimensions of source credibility - perceived source expertise and perceived source trustworthiness - and, hence, on messages attitudes. This was tested for online product reviewers by means of two experiments. The results revealed two competing mechanisms: A consumer <b>source</b> (vs. <b>expert</b> <b>source)</b> had a positive indirect effect on review attitude through perceived trustworthiness, and a negative indirect effect through perceived expertise. In tandem, these mechanisms suppressed the relationship between source type and review attitude. This suppression situation only emerged when the expert status of the source was based on self-claims; when the expert status of the source was verified by a peer rating system, no suppression situation emerged. The theoretical, methodological and societal implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

40|$|How people {{perceive}} {{public opinion is}} important because it affects their willingness to express themselves. This paper investigates whether two different portrayals of public opinion in the TV news affect people’s perception of public opinion. We use an experimental design in which roughly one thousand subjects were exposed to a fictional television news item. The news items contained either popular exemplars or base-rate information offered by experts each presenting different public opinion distributions. We find that exemplification, which is frequently employed in the news, has an effect on the news broadcast viewers’ perception of dominant public opinion. However, in contrast to previous work, we find that base-rate information has a larger effect on perceived public opinion when offered by a speaking <b>source</b> (<b>expert)</b> making it vivid. The factors underlying this differential effect are the success at being an attention commander and a credible source (trustworthiness and expertise). Speaking experts are evaluated as equally trustworthy and effective attention commanders as popular exemplars but have far greater expertise...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for supervised domain adaptation that {{is based upon the}} probabilistic framework of Gaussian processes (GPs). Specifically, we introduce domain-specific GPs as local experts for facial expression classification from face images. The adaptation of the classifier is facilitated in probabilistic fashion by conditioning the target <b>expert</b> on multiple <b>source</b> <b>experts.</b> Furthermore, in contrast to existing adaptation approaches, we also learn a target expert from available target data solely. Then, a single and confident classifier is obtained by combining the predictions from multiple experts based on their confidence. Learning of the model is efficient and requires no retraining/reweighting of the source classifiers. We evaluate the proposed approach on two publicly available datasets for multi-class (MultiPIE) and multi-label (DISFA) facial expression classification. To this end, we perform adaptation of two contextual factors: where (view) and who (subject). We show in our experiments that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both source and target classifiers, while using as few as 30 target examples. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for supervised domain adaptation...|$|R
