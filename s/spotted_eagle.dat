5|$|The dorsal spots {{make the}} <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> ray an {{aquarium}} attraction, although {{because of its}} large size it is likely kept only at public aquariums. There are no target fisheries for the <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> ray, but it is often eaten after being caught unintentionally as bycatch. There have been several reported incidents of <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> rays leaping {{out of the water}} onto boats and landing on people. Nevertheless, <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> rays do not pose a significant threat to humans, as they are shy and generally avoid human contact. Interactions with an individual snorkeler in the Caribbean has been reported especially in Jamaica involving one, two and even three <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> rays. The rays may exhibit a behavior similar to human curiosity which allows the snorkeler to observe the eagle ray who may slow down so as to share more time with the much slower human observer if the human observer appears to be unthreatening or interesting to the <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> ray.|$|E
5|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> ray {{has many}} {{different}} common names, including white-spotted eagle ray, bonnet skate, bonnet ray, duckbill ray and spotted duck-billed ray.|$|E
5|$|As {{traditionally}} defined, <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> {{rays are}} found globally in tropical regions from the Indo-Pacific region {{from the western}} Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the western Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5000|$|Clanga is a genus which {{contains}} the <b>spotted</b> <b>eagles.</b> The genus name is from Ancient Greek klangos, [...] "eagle".|$|R
5000|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>eagles</b> as a {{group are}} quite {{distinct}} from the typical members of Aquila, the [...] "true eagles".|$|R
50|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>eagles</b> (previously Aquila clanga, A. pomarina, A. (p.) hastata) {{are thought}} to be genetically closer to Ictinaetus and Lophoaetus than to other Aquila species, and may be placed into a {{separate}} genus, Clanga.|$|R
5|$|<b>Spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> ray preys mainly upon bivalves, crabs, whelks, benthic infauna {{they also}} feed on mollusks, crustaceans, {{particularly}} malacostracans. and also upon hermit crabs, shrimp, octopuses, and some small fish.|$|E
5|$|<b>Spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> rays, {{in common}} with many other rays, often fall victim to sharks such as the tiger shark, the lemon shark, the bull shark, the silver tip shark, and the great hammerhead shark. A great hammerhead shark has been {{observed}} attacking a <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> ray in open water by taking a large bite {{out of one of}} its pectoral fins, thus incapacitating the ray. The shark then used its head to pin the ray to the bottom and pivoted to take the ray in its jaws, head first. Sharks have also been observed to follow female rays during the birthing season, and feed on the newborn pups.|$|E
5|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> ray (Aetobatus narinari) is a {{cartilaginous}} fish of {{the eagle}} ray family, Myliobatidae. As traditionally recognized, {{it is found}} globally in tropical regions, including the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Recent authorities have restricted it to the Atlantic (including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico) with other populations recognized as the ocellated eagle ray (A. ocellatus) and Pacific white-spotted eagle ray (A. laticeps). <b>Spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> rays are most commonly seen alone, but occasionally swim in groups. They are ovoviviparous, the female retaining the eggs then releasing the young as miniature versions of the parent.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>eagles</b> as a {{group are}} quite {{distinct}} from the typical members of Aquila, the [...] "true eagles". They will probably be separated in Lophaetus, Ictinaetus or a genus of their own in the near future.|$|R
5000|$|A {{breeding}} complex {{was established}} in the zoo's affiliate [...] "Cīruļi" [...] in 2000. White-tailed <b>eagles,</b> lesser <b>spotted</b> <b>eagles,</b> peregrine falcons, barn owls and Eurasian eagle-owls are bred to reintroduce these species in Latvia and extend existing populations.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The gape of the {{steppe eagle}} {{is an easy}} way to {{distinguish}} it from the tawny eagle. The gape extends beyond the centre of the eye as against the tawny. The oval nostril sets it apart from the <b>spotted</b> <b>eagles.</b>|$|R
5|$|As other rays, <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> {{rays are}} host {{to a variety}} of parasites. Internal parasites include the gnathostomatid {{nematode}} Echinocephalus sinensis in the spiral intestine. External parasites include the monocotylid monogeneans Decacotyle octona, Decacotyle elpora and Thaumatocotyle pseudodasybatis on the gills.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, 2016, when electors {{formally}} voted, Clinton {{lost five}} of her initial 232 votes due to faithless electors, {{with three of}} her Washington votes instead being cast for Colin Powell, one being cast for Faith <b>Spotted</b> <b>Eagle</b> and one in Hawaii being cast for Bernie Sanders.|$|E
5|$|<b>Spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> {{rays are}} found in warm and {{temperate}} waters worldwide. In the western Atlantic Ocean it is found off the eastern coast of United States of America, the Gulf Stream, the Caribbean, and down past {{the southern part of}} Brazil. In the Indian Ocean, it is found from the Red Sea down to South Africa and eastward to the Andaman Sea. In the Western Pacific Ocean it can be found near Japan and north of Australia. In the Central Pacific Ocean, it can be found throughout the Hawaiian Islands. In the Eastern-Pacific Ocean, it is found in the Gulf of California down through Puerto Pizarro, an area that includes the Galapagos Islands. <b>Spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> rays are most commonly seen in bays and reefs. They spend much of their time swimming freely in open waters, generally in schools close to the surface, and can travel long distances in a day.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>eagles</b> {{are quite}} {{distinct}} {{as a group}} from the typical members of Aquila, the [...] "true eagles". They will probably be included with their putative tropical relatives in Lophaetus or Ictinaetus, or moved to a genus of their own in the future.|$|R
25|$|The {{region is}} {{a haven for}} 141 species of migratory and {{resident}} birds of the desert. One can see eagles, harriers, falcons, buzzards, kestrel and vultures. There are short-toed eagles (Circaetus gallicus), tawny eagles (Aquila rapax), greater <b>spotted</b> <b>eagles</b> (Aquila clanga), laggar falcons (Falco jugger) and kestrels. There are also a number of reptiles.|$|R
50|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant numbers of visiting and resident birds, some of which are threatened. These include vulnerable Chinese egrets, greater <b>spotted</b> <b>eagles</b> and straw-headed bulbuls, endangered Nordmann's greenshanks and critically endangered spoon-billed sandpipers, as well as greater crested terns.|$|R
5|$|This ray can be {{identified}} by its dark dorsal surface covered in white spots or rings. Near {{the base of the}} ray's relatively long tail, just behind the pelvic fins, are several venomous, barbed stingers. <b>Spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> rays commonly feed on small fish and crustaceans, and will sometimes dig with their snouts to look for food buried in the sand of the sea bed. These rays are commonly observed leaping out of the water, and on at least two occasions have been reported as having jumped into boats, in one incident resulting in the death of a woman in the Florida Keys. The <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> ray is hunted by a wide variety of sharks. The rays are considered near threatened on the IUCN Red List. They are fished mainly in Southeast Asia and Africa, the most common market being in commercial trade and aquariums. They are protected in the Great Barrier Reef.|$|E
5|$|Within these regions, {{there are}} {{significant}} variations in genetics and morphology. As a consequence, recent authorities have split it into three: This restricts the true <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> ray (A. narinari) to the Atlantic, while the Indo-Pacific population is the ocellated eagle ray (A. ocellatus) and the East Pacific is the Pacific white-spotted eagle ray (A. laticeps).|$|E
5|$|Predators of the {{yellowhammer}} {{include the}} sparrowhawk, northern goshawk, lesser <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> and hobby. It {{is not a}} significant host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite, although as a ground-nesting bird its eggs and chicks are vulnerable to predation from small mammals such as mice and other rodents. Nests are also raided by crows, Eurasian jays and Eurasian magpies. Predation {{accounted for more than}} 60% of nest failures in a 2012 survey in Germany.|$|E
50|$|According to a World Wildlife Fund {{study in}} 1992, Latvia has populations of black storks, lesser <b>spotted</b> <b>eagles,</b> otters, beaver, lynx, and wolves. There are also great {{concentrations}} of deer (86,000: red deer and roe deer), wild boar (32,000), elk (25,000) and red fox (13,000). Many Latvians today {{are planning to}} exploit this resource by catering to local and foreign numbers.|$|R
50|$|In the 2016 presidential election, {{she became}} the first Native American to receive an electoral vote for President of the United States as well {{as one of the first}} two women to receive a presidential electoral vote. <b>Spotted</b> <b>Eagle's</b> single vote came from Robert Satiacum Jr., a faithless elector in Washington, who cast it for her instead of Hillary Clinton.|$|R
5000|$|The {{territories of}} Lesser <b>Spotted</b> <b>Eagles</b> are spaced {{regularly}} and consistently between {{years in the}} north-western part of their distribution. The distances between territories vary across the region, although this was {{not found to be}} related to breeding success. Synchronous variation in breeding success across the region indicates that the eagles are instead influenced by large-scale factors such as fluctuations in climate or prey availability.|$|R
5|$|The Northern Anatolian conifer and {{deciduous}} forests is an ecoregion {{which covers}} {{most of the}} Pontic Mountains in northern Turkey, while the Caucasus mixed forests extend across {{the eastern end of}} the range. The region is home to Eurasian wildlife such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk, golden eagle, eastern imperial eagle, lesser <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle,</b> Caucasian black grouse, red-fronted serin, and wallcreeper. The narrow coastal strip between the Pontic Mountains and the Black Sea is home to the Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests, which contain some of the world's few temperate rainforests. The Turkish pine is mostly found in Turkey and other east Mediterranean countries. Several wild species of tulip are native to Anatolia, and the flower was first introduced to Western Europe with species taken from the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century.|$|E

25|$|The Tuvalu Marine Life {{study also}} {{recorded}} low densities of {{two species of}} rays: manta ray (Manta birostris) and <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> ray (Aetobatus narinari), which are both listed on the IUCN Red List of threatened species, as ‘near threatened’ species.|$|E
50|$|Young birds at {{the nest}} are {{sometimes}} preyed on by imperial, steppe and greater <b>spotted</b> <b>eagles.</b> Chaunocephalus ferox, an intestinal parasite, is a trematode worm found in about 80% {{of the wild}} populations in Thailand while another species Echinoparyphium oscitansi has been described from Asian openbills in Thailand. Other helminth parasites such as Thapariella anastomusa, T. oesophagiala and T. udaipurensis have been described from the oesophagus of storks.|$|R
2500|$|The Desert National Park in Jaisalmer {{is spread}} over {{an area of}} , is an {{excellent}} example of the ecosystem of the Thar Desert and its diverse fauna. [...] Seashells and massive fossilised tree trunks in this park record the geological history of the desert. The region is a haven for migratory and resident birds of the desert. One can see many eagles, harriers, falcons, buzzards, kestrels and vultures. Short-toed snake eagles (Circaetus gallicus), tawny <b>eagles</b> (Aquila rapax), <b>spotted</b> <b>eagles</b> (Aquila clanga), laggar falcons (Falco jugger) and kestrels are the commonest of these.|$|R

25|$|A small bushy tree, Alchornea rhodophylla, the almost-extinct Maingaya malayana {{tree and}} the Ansonia penangensis toad are endemic to Penang Island. Some of the {{commonly}} seen birds in Penang include the migratory greater <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> (Aquila clanga), the blue-tailed bee-eater (Merops philippinus), the blue-throated bee-eater (Merops viridis), the endemic chestnut-headed bee-eater (Merops leschenaulti), the brahmniy kite (Haliastur indus), the common sandpiper (Actitis hypoleucos), and the white-bellied sea eagle.|$|E
50|$|Even in the {{deteriorated}} {{condition of the}} lake, birds such as the White-breasted Kingfisher (Halcyon smyrnensis), Magpie Robin (Copsychus saularis), Little Egrets, Common Mynas (Acridotheres tristis), Brahminy Kites, Black Drongos, Bulbuls, greater coucals, purple sunbirds, etc., (some are pictured in the gallery) {{have been reported in}} and around the lake periphery. Documented records of sighting of 2000 water birds of 29 species have been reported. The lake is also a great place for the winter migrants. Harriers and <b>spotted</b> <b>eagles</b> have been reported on this lake during winter. Bird poaching traps, a common sight, are located and removed from the bed of the lake quite often.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT To date, {{most of the}} Lesser <b>Spotted</b> <b>Eagles</b> Aquila pomarina that we have {{tracked by}} {{satellite}} telemetry migrated in autumn along a direct route from Israel to Africa, via Suez (Egypt). In both 1997 and 1998, however, one adult female was tracked to {{the southern tip of}} the Sinai Peninsula, and from there flew north again to Suez. Only one other adult eagle is known to have flown south over the Sinai Peninsula, but from there crossed the Gulf of Suez. The possible reasons for this behaviour, involving a 500 -km detour and a flight of about three and a half days, are discussed. Satellite-tracked Lesser Spotted Eagl...|$|R
