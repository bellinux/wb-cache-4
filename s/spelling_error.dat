The real breakthrough by Dorsey’s AES team was that their machine stored the operator’s texts on magnetic disks.

More importantly, a text could be edited, for instance a paragraph {{moved to a new}} place, or a <b>spelling</b> <b>error</b> corrected, and these changes were recorded on the magnetic disk.|$|E

In this study, the writer aims to analyze the kinds of <b>spelling</b> <b>errors,</b> the frequency of <b>spelling</b> <b>errors,</b> and the causes of <b>spelling</b> <b>errors</b> made by 3 rd year students at MTs Muhammadiyah 1 Malang.

40|$|Spellcheckers such as ASPELL and Microsoft Word 2007 were {{designed}} to correct the <b>spelling</b> <b>errors</b> of native writers of English (NWEs). While they are widely used and fairly effective at this task, they do not perform well when used to correct the <b>spelling</b> <b>errors</b> in English text written by Japanese writers of English (JWEFLs). The first contribution of this thesis is a comprehensive analysis of the English <b>spelling</b> <b>errors</b> of Japanese writ-ers of English as a foreign language (JWEFLs) {{with the goal of}} finding differences from NWE <b>spelling</b> <b>errors</b> that would cause such poor spellchecker performance. In addition to describing the patterns of characteristic JWEFL errors I also provide hypotheses for why each error is observed. I find that JWEFL errors are 2 - 3 {{times more likely to have}} a mistake in the first letter and 4 - 5 times more likely to have more than one mistake in them than NWE spellings errors. These facts make it very difficult for widely-used English spellcheckers to correct JWEFL errors, because they are designed to exploit patterns in NWE <b>spelling</b> <b>errors</b> which simply are not present in Japanese learner text. I assert, however, that while JWEFL <b>spelling</b> <b>errors</b> do not have the same patterns as NWE errors, they do display patterns tha...|$|R
500|$|As the {{original}} version featured a cast of well-known anime voice actors, the Atlus USA localization team sought out well-known English voice actors for the dub, and took extra care with syncing the English dialogue with {{the original}} characters' lip movements. Digital Devil Saga was the first Megami Tensei project to feature an extensive voice acting element. During localization, localization project manager Yu Namba made a <b>spelling</b> <b>error</b> {{during one of the}} early cutscenes where the name of Serph's demon form was shown: the demon's name was displayed as [...] "Varna", when it was actually [...] "Varuna". The error was not spotted until it was too late, and so remained in the game. One of the main concerns was to keep the characters' personalities intact when shifting from Japanese to English dialogue: a cited example of how this change was accomplished was Cielo, who was given a Jamaican accent to express the character's easy-going and friendly personality. After the release of Nocturne, the [...] "Shin Megami Tensei" [...] moniker was attached to the Digital Devil Saga games to help with marketing.|$|E

2500|$|The {{scientific}} name Ginkgo {{is the result}} of a <b>spelling</b> <b>error</b> that occurred three centuries ago. Kanji typically have multiple pronunciations in Japanese, and the characters 銀杏 used for ginnan can also be pronounced ginkyō. Engelbert Kaempfer, the first Westerner to investigate the species in 1690, wrote down this pronunciation in the notes that he later used for the Amoenitates Exoticae (1712) with the [...] "awkward" [...] spelling [...] "ginkgo". This appears to be a simple error of Kaempfer; taking his spelling of other Japanese words containing the syllable [...] "kyō" [...] into account, a more precise romanization following his writing habits would have been [...] "ginkio" [...] or [...] "ginkjo".
