40|$|Lake Liambezi in the Zambezi Region of Namibia, {{formerly}} known as the Caprivi Region, is shallow (< 6 m deep) and characterised by cyclic episodes of filling and drying. When full the lake supports a highly productive fishery and when dry the lake is completely dry and used for agriculture and grazing. In 2000 the lake filled, and between May 2011 and April 2012 was surveyed using beach seine, experimental gillnets and catch landing surveys to obtain information for conservation and management recommendations for the fishery. Littoral fishes in Lake Liambezi and the Kavango floodplain were sampled using <b>seine</b> <b>net</b> and physicochemical properties were measured. <b>Seine</b> <b>net</b> surveys demonstrated that Lake Liambezi littoral zones were dominated by fishes of the family Alestidae (59. 7 %) while Cichlids constituted the most diverse family. Juvenile Tilapia rendalli and Oreochromis macrochir were among the five most important species in the littoral zone, indicating that these commercially important species use the littoral zone as a nursery ground. Since T. rendalli and O. macrochir are commercially important species, because of this, it is advised that <b>seine</b> <b>nets</b> should <b>not</b> be used. Catch efficiency between monofilament and multifilament gillnets in Lake Liambezi offshore waters were assessed. Catch efficiency experimental fishing trials showed that monofilament gillnets catch per unit effort (CPUE) was three times higher than that of multifilament gillnets for Oreochromis andersonii, O. macrochir, T. rendalli, Serranochromis macrocephalus and Clarias spp. Oreochromis andersonii comprised over 66 % of the overall CPUE for both net types combined indicating the importance of this species in the gillnet fishery on the lake. A fishery has been established on the lake with more than 300 canoes and 120 fishermen using monofilament and multifilament gillnets. CPUE was 15 kg/canoe/day and was significantly (P < 0. 05) associated with monthly temperature and moon phase parameters indicating that the fishery of Lake Liambezi may be altered by climate and environmental factors. Annual catch from Lake Liambezi was estimated at 3193 t with an estimated productivity of 106 kg/ha, suggesting that Lake Liambezi makes a significant contribution to the fish supply in the Zambezi Region. Recommendations were made to manage the Lake Liambezi fishery by imposing restrictions on effort (number of fishing boats), gear type, mesh sizes and access. Proper fisheries management and monitoring should incorporate climatic and environmental factors such as temperature and moon phase {{to meet the challenges of}} global climatic changes as well as other environmental issues...|$|R

5000|$|In 1920, though, the {{government}} {{changed the rules}} by removing the guaranteed price for the herring and prices dropped dramatically. In 1921, some Lossiemouth skippers noticed that the Danish <b>seine</b> <b>net</b> boats were landing huge quantities of plaice and other white fish at the English east coast ports. Their interest resulted in a few buying some <b>seine</b> <b>nets</b> and winches and trying this form of fishing. As they perfected <b>seine</b> <b>net</b> fishing, more of the Lossiemouth fleet converted to <b>seine</b> <b>net.</b> But boat design {{for this type of}} fishing was still proving to be an obstacle. That, and the cost of the majority steam boats prompted a new style of fishing boat. John Campbell, nephew of William Campbell who designed the first Zulu boat built a wooden boat that resembled, to some extent, the [...] "Fifie" [...] but had a broad beam. His boat, the Marigold, did very well and over a relatively short period the entire Lossiemouth fleet (the first in Scotland) converted to the <b>seine</b> <b>net.</b> Other east coast ports followed on very quickly.|$|R
5000|$|The Puretic {{power block}} {{revolutionized}} {{the technology of}} hauling fishing <b>nets,</b> particularly purse <b>seine</b> <b>nets.</b> According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), [...] "no single invention has contributed more {{to the success of}} purse <b>seine</b> <b>net</b> hauling" [...] than the power block, which was [...] "the linch-pin in the mechanization of purse seining".|$|R
5000|$|<b>Seine</b> <b>nets</b> - {{are large}} fishing nets {{that can be}} {{arranged}} in different ways. In purse seining fishing the net hangs vertically in the water by attaching weights along the bottom edge and floats along the top. Danish seining is a method which has some similarities with trawling. A simple and commonly used fishing technique is beach seining, where the <b>seine</b> <b>net</b> is operated from the shore.|$|R
50|$|The {{settlers}} {{learned the}} use of <b>seine</b> <b>nets</b> from Native Americans. By 1895 there were eighty-four seines on the Columbia, and Robert Hume started hauling them with teams of horses. The seines were operated from day break to dawn around islands and along beaches. At Puget Sound salmon were caught by fishing boats using purse <b>seine</b> <b>nets.</b> Purse <b>seine</b> <b>nets</b> are used to encircle a school of salmon and then trap them by drawing ("pursing") {{the bottom of the}} net together, as you would with a string purse. By 1905 the boats used engines for hauling the seine lines. In 1922 it was made illegal to use salmon purse seiners on and around the Columbia. In 1948, horse and manual seines were also outlawed.|$|R

40|$|Exploratory {{investigations}} of optimal sampling designs are {{a critical component}} of the decision-making process in ecology where inherent natural variation can lead to erroneous conclusions if left unexamined. Pilot studies and exploratory analyses that investigate the precision of sampling regimes may reduce the chances of erroneous results and can be used to optimise processing time in larger ecological research programs. In our study, we calculated optimal precision estimates for sampling macroinvertebrates and ichthyofauna in surf-zone wrack accumulations by investigating the precision of the mean for sub-samples of <b>seine</b> <b>nets</b> and also for the number of replicate <b>seine</b> <b>nets</b> to guide future sampling regimes. We discovered that the processing time for individual <b>seine</b> <b>net</b> samples could be reduced by 50 % using sub-sampling and that time to process replicate <b>seine</b> <b>net</b> samples could be reduced by 25 % while maintaining acceptable precision. In future, we suggest that the use of pilot studies with similar exploratory approaches should be less of an exception and more {{a critical component of}} ecological investigations, particularly in under-studied or newly-developing areas of research. Further, these types of exploratory approaches are crucially important in a variety of extremely patchy environments where variability is likely to be high...|$|R
