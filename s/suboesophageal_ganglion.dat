40|$|DMRT (Doublesex and Mab- 3 related {{transcription}} factor) proteins generally {{associated with}} sexual differentiation in many organisms {{share a common}} DNA binding domain and are often expressed in reproductive tissues. Aside from doublesex, which is a central factor in the regulation of sex determination, Drosophila possesses three different dmrt genes that are of unknown function. Because the association with sexual differentiation and reproduction is not universal and some DMRT proteins {{have been found to}} play other developmental roles we chose to further characterize one of these Drosophila genes. We carried out genetic analysis of dmrt 93 B, which was previously found to be expressed sex-specifically in the developing somatic gonad and to affect testis morphogenesis in RNAi knockdowns. In order to disrupt this gene, the GAL 4 yeast transcriptional activator followed by a polyadenylation signal was inserted after the dmrt 93 B start codon and introduced into the genome by homologous recombination. Analysis of the knock-in mutation as well as a small deletion removing all dmrt 93 B sequence demonstrate that loss of function causes partial lethality at the late pupal stage. Surprisingly, these mutations have no significant effect on gonad formation or male fertility. Analysis of GAL 4 -driven GFP reporter expression indicates that the dmrt 93 B promoter activity is highly specific to neurons in the <b>suboesophageal</b> and proventricular <b>ganglion</b> in larva and adult of both sexes suggesting a possible role in digestive tract function. Using the Capillary Feeder (CAFÉ) assay to measure daily food intake we find that reduction in this gene’s function leads to an increase in food consumption. These results suggest dmrt 93 {{plays an important role in}} the formation or maintenance of neurons that affect feeding and support the idea that dmrt genes may not be restricted to roles in sexual differentiation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The role {{of certain}} parts of the central nervous system in the control of feeding behaviour, and {{especially}} of chewing, has been investigated by the use of lesions. Cutting the connectives behind the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> disinhibits chewing, so that continuous rhythmic mandibular movements occur {{even in the absence of}} mechano- or chemostimulation of the mouthparts. Stimulation of the mouthparts with plant material leads to an increased rate of chewing and to maintained ingestion. Isolating the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> from the protocerebrum does not prevent the induction of chewing and maintained ingestion. Severing the frontal connectives (uni- or bilaterally) eliminates maintained ingestion but not the ability to chew. The centrally isolated <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> is capable of producing a co-ordinated chewing behaviour, but not of ingesting food.

Identified long hair sensilla are cobalt filled, and central projections of sensory fibres are {{reported for the}} first time in the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> of this scorpion. The afferent fibres arising from each long hair sensilla segregate into ventral, dorsomedial and dorsal tracts upon their entry into the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion.</b> These transverse tracts bifurcate towards the middle of the leg neuromere and form three ipsilateral, plurisegrnental, longitudinal sensory pathways. Filling a pair of bilaterally distributed long hair sensilla shows bilaterally arranged longitudinal afferent tracts interconnected by distinct transverse commissures. Similar patterns of sensory projections are observed when filling homologous hairs on other legs and pedipalps. Numerous fine collaterals arise from the longitudinal sensory trancts that subdivide and end in small blebs presumed to be presynaptic endings. The dorsal and dorsomedial longitudinal tracts and their respective commissures are in close association with the dendritic arborisations of pedipalpal and leg motor neurons, suggesting direct contact between them.

As octopamine is involved in learning and memory in insects we investigated octopaminergic pathways {{in the brain and}} <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> (SOG) of the two wasps. We used an anti-octopamine antibody and subsequent whole mount analysis using a confocal laserscanning microscope and pertinent software.

40|$|In termites, i. e. a {{major group}} of eusocial insects, the soldier caste {{exhibits}} specific morphological characteristics and extremely high aggression against predators. Although the genomic background {{is identical to}} the other non-aggressive castes, they acquire the soldier-specific behavioral character during the course of caste differentiation. The high aggressiveness and defensive behavior is essential for colony survival, but the neurophysiological bases are completely unknown. In the present study, using the damp-wood termite Hodotermopsis sjostedti, we focused on two biogenic amines, octopamine (OA) and tyramine (TA), as candidate neuromodulators for the defensive behavior in soldiers. High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis revealed that TA levels in the brain and <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> (SOG) and the OA level in brain were increased in soldiers than in pseudergates (worker caste). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that TA/OA neurons that innervate specific areas, including the mandibular muscles, antennal nerve, central complex, <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion,</b> and thoracic and/or abdominal ganglia, were enlarged in a soldier-specific manner. Together with the results that pharmacological application of TA promoted the defensive behavior in pseudergates, these findings suggest that the increased TA/OA levels induce the higher aggressiveness and defensive behavior in termite soldiers.

40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{and defensive}} {{behaviors that are}} initiated in response to specific sensory cues can provide insight into how choices are made between different social behaviors. We manipulated both the activity and sex of a subset of neurons and found significant changes in male social behavior. Results from aggression assays indicate that the neuromodulator octopamine (OCT) is necessary for Drosophila males to coordinate sensory cue information presented by a second male and respond with the appropriate behavior: aggression rather than courtship. In competitive male courtship assays, males with no OCT or with low OCT levels do not adapt to changing sensory cues and court both males and females. We identified a small subset of neurons in the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> region of the adult male brain that coexpress OCT and male forms of the neural sex determination factor, Fruitless (FruM). A single FruM-positive OCT neuron sends extensive bilateral arborizations to the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion,</b> the lateral accessory lobe, and possibly the posterior antennal lobe, suggesting a mechanism for integrating multiple sensory modalities. Furthermore, eliminating the expression of FruM by transformer expression in OCT/tyramine neurons changes the aggression versus courtship response behavior.

40|$|Background: Stick insects (Phasmatodea) use {{repellent}} {{chemical substances}} (allomones) for defence which are released from so-called defence glands in the prothorax. These glands differ in size between species, and are under neuronal control from the CNS. The detailed neural innervation and possible differences between species are not studied so far. Using axonal tracing, the neuronal innervation is investigated comparing four species. The {{aim is to}} document the complexity of defence gland innervation in peripheral nerves and central motoneurons in stick insects. Results: In the species studied here, the defence gland is innervated by the intersegmental nerve complex (ISN) which is formed by three nerves from the prothoracic (T 1) and <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> (SOG), {{as well as a}} distinct suboesophageal nerve (Nervus anterior of the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion).</b> In Carausius morosus and Sipyloidea sipylus, axonal tracing confirmed an innervation of the defence glands by this N. anterior SOG as well as N. anterior T 1 and N. posterior SOG from the intersegmental nerve complex. In Peruphasma schultei, which has rather large defence glands, only the innervation by the N. anterior SOG was documented by axonal tracing. In the central nervous system of all species, 3 - 4 neuron types are identified by axonal tracing which send axons in the N. anterior SOG likely innervating the defence gland as well as adjacent muscles. These neurons are mainly suboesophageal neurons with one intersegmental neuron located in the prothoracic ganglion. The neuron types are conserved in the species studied, but the combination of neuron types is not identical. In addition, the central nervous system in S. sipylus contains one suboesophageal and one prothoracic neuron type with axons in the intersegmental nerve complex contacting the defence gland. Conclusions: Axonal tracing shows a very complex innervation pattern of the defence glands of Phasmatodea which contains different neurons in different nerves from two adjacent body segments. The gland size correlates {{to the size of a}} neuron soma in the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion,</b> which likely controls gland contraction. In P. schultei, the innervation pattern appears simplified to the anterior suboesophageal nerve. Hence, some evolutionary changes are notable in a conserved neuronal network...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The escape {{behavior}} of the cock-roach is a ballistic behavior with well characterized kinematics. The circuitry known to control the behavior lies in the thoracic ganglia, abdominal ganglia, and ab-dominal nerve cord. Some evidence suggests inputs may occur from the brain or <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion.</b> We tested this notion by decapitating cockroaches, removing all descending inputs, and evoking escape responses. The decapitated cockroaches exhibited directionally appro-priate escape turns. However, there was a front-to-back gradient of change: the front legs moved little if at all, the middle legs moved in the proper direction but with reduced excursion, and the rear legs moved normally. The same pattern was seen when only inputs from the brain were removed, the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> re-maining intact and connected to the thoracic ganglia. Electromyogram (EMG) analysis showed {{that the loss of}} or reduction in excursion was accompanied by a loss of or reduction in fast motor neuron activity. The loss of fast motor neuron activity was also observed in a re-duced preparation in which descending neural signals were reversibly blocked via an isotonic sucrose solution superfusing the neck connectives, indicating that the changes seen were not due to trauma. Our data demon-strate that while the thoracic circuitry is sufficient to produce directional escape, lesion or blockage of the connective affects the excitability of components of the escape circuitry. Because of the rapidity of the escape response, such effects are likely due to the elimination o...|$|E

In this study, we present the ultrastructure of the sensilla styloconica and the central projection pattern of their associated receptor neurons in larvae of the heliothine moth, Helicoverpa armigera. By means of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, the previous findings of two morphologically fairly similar sensilla comprising a socketed conic tip inserted into a large peg were confirmed. However, the peg size of the medial sensillum {{was found to be}} significantly bigger than that of the lateral sensillum. The sensory neurons derived from each sensillum styloconicum were mapped separately using anterograde staining experiments combined with confocal laser-scanning microscopy. For determining the afferents ’ target regions relative to each other, we reconstructed the labeled axons and placed them into a common reference framework. The sensory axons from both sensilla projected via the ipsilateral maxillary nerve to the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> and further through the ipsilateral circumoesophageal connective to the brain.

40|$|Learning {{and memory}} {{is not an}} {{attribute}} of higher animals. Even Drosophila larvae are able to form and recall an association of a given odor with an aversive or appetitive gustatory reinforcer. As the Drosophila larva {{has turned into a}} particularly simple model for studying odor processing, a detailed neuronal and functional map of the olfactory pathway is available up to the third order neurons in the mushroom bodies. At this point, a convergence of olfactory processing and gustatory reinforcement is suggested to underlie associative memory formation. The dopaminergic system was shown to be involved in mammalian and insect olfactory conditioning. To analyze the anatomy and function of the larval dopaminergic system, we first characterize dopaminergic neurons immunohistochemically up to the single cell level and subsequent test for the effects of distortions in the dopamine system upon aversive (odor-salt) as well as appetitive (odor-sugar) associative learning. Single cell analysis suggests that dopaminergic neurons do not directly connect gustatory input in the larval <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> to olfactory information in the mushroom bodies. However, a number of dopaminergic neurons innervate different regions of the brain, including protocerebra, mushroom bodies and <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion.</b> We found that dopamine receptors are highly enriched in the mushroom bodies and that aversive and appetitive olfactory learning is strongly impaired in dopamine receptor mutants.

40|$|Whereas the “vertical” {{elements}} of the insect olfactory pathway, the olfactory receptor neurons and the projection neurons, have been studied in great detail, local interneurons providing “horizontal” connections in the antennal lobe were ignored for a long time. Recent studies in adult Drosophila demonstrate diverse roles for these neurons in the integration of odor information, consistent with the identification of a large variety of anatomical and neurochemical subtypes. Here {{we focus on the}} larval olfactory circuit of Drosophila, which is much reduced in terms of cell numbers. We show that the horizontal connectivity in the larval antennal lobe differs largely from its adult counterpart. Only one of the five anatomical types of neurons we describe is restricted to the antennal lobe and therefore fits the definition of a local interneuron. Interestingly, the four remaining subtypes innervate both the antennal lobe and the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion.</b> In the latter, they may overlap with primary gustatory terminals and with arborizations of hugin cells, which are involved in feeding control. This circuitry suggests special links between smell and taste, which may reflect the chemosensory constraints of a crawling and burrowing lifestyle. We also demonstrate that many of the neurons we describe exhibit highly variable trajectories and arborizations, especially in the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion.</b> Together with reports from adult Drosophila, these data suggest that wiring variability may be another principle of insect brain organization, in parallel with stereotypy...|$|E

40|$|Major animal taxa, {{known as}} phyla, each {{represents}} a basic bauplan. Among {{the diversity of}} phyla, arthropods are the most dominant on the earth. The conspicuous feature of the arthropod bauplan is the grouping of body segments into specialized units by the phenomenon of tagmosis which in insect {{has given rise to}} three body regions; head, thorax and abdomen. But the number and the nature of segments involved in composition of the insect head is still a matter of dispute among today’s evolutionary biologists. From the beginning of the dispute, there was general agreement that three mouthparts segments (mandible, maxillae, and labium) take part in the head composition, and their ganglia fuse to form the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> of the insect nervous system. However, the nature of the segments anterior to the mandible (labral/ocular, antennal, and intercalary segments) remained controversial. Modern molecular, palaeontological, and neuroanatomical studies showed that the insect head is composed of six segments; occular, antennal, intercalary, and three gnathal segments. But conflicting views are still present regarding the nature and segmental affiliation of the insect labrum. Several such modern studies imply that the labrum is a highly modified appendage of the intercalary segment, and sensory innervation of the embryonic and the adult labrum shares many similarities with that of head and thoracic appendages. However, defining criterion of an appendage implies that every appendage must be innervated by its own segmental ganglion, and the innervation pattern must include both sensory and motor elements. The aim of thesis is to investigate the motor innervation pattern of muscles of the labrum in the adult locust to reveal the evolutionary changes underlying neuronal circuitry, which might help to decide whether the labrum represents a structure that has developed during the evolution by fusion of paired appendages associated with the intercalary segment. Using Neurobiotin as a retrograde neuronal tracer, specific motor nerves of individual labral muscles were stained. Results show that all labral muscles receive innervation from both the tritocerebral lobes of the brain and the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion,</b> except for M 1, the labral compressor muscle. M 1 is innervated by two motor neurons. Both tritocerebral lobes contain one soma. The axons of both neurons branch in the periphery to innervate ipsi- and contralateral muscles. The labral anterior retractor muscles, M 2, are innervated by 6 tritocerebral motor neurons, with 3 somata located in each tritocerebral lobe. Their axons cross the midline in a distinct commissure between the two muscles. The labral posterior retractor muscles, M 3 and anterior dilator muscles of foregut, M 38, are innervated from the ipsilateral tritocerebrum only. Both muscles together receive 8 motor axons and there are some common motor neurons that innervate both muscles. In addition, M 2, M 3 and M 38 also receive common innervation from neurons located in the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> (SOG). In relation to the muscle, their somata are located on the ipsi- and the contralateral sides of the SOG. Their axons ascend through the circumoesophageal connectives and proceed into the frontal connectives without forming ramifications in the tritocerebral lobes. These axons also cross the midline in the periphery to reach muscles {{on both sides of the}} head. They either cross within the commissure between muscles M 2, or through the frontal ganglion. Further more, electrophysiology of labral muscles in isolated insect heads was investigated by intracellular recordings from the fibers of individual muscles. The recordings showed that all postsynaptic potentials were excitatory and no inhibitory synaptic inputs to labral muscles were found during the present study. Similarly simultaneous intracellular recording from fibers of labral muscles and <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> motor neurons also revealed no inhibitory synaptic inputs to labral muscles, and showed that suboesophageal neurons are common excitatory motor neurons. The innervation pattern was compared with that of the other body appendages of locust, and it was concluded that labral muscles are innervated from both sides of the CNS and their innervation pattern is bilaterally symmetric as that of other appendages. The participation of both tritocerebral and <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> motor neurons supports the notion that the labrum is innervated by the so-called intercalary segment. The innervation pattern also supports the idea that the labrum derives from fused appendages: There are two symmetrical sets of motor neurons. Some of them cross the midline in the periphery. This indicates that during the evolution of the labrum its motor innervation pattern was reconfigured in the periphery, while the original bilateral sets of central neurons remained unchanged...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In honeybees (Apis mellifera), the {{biogenic}} amine octopamine {{has been shown}} {{to play a role in}} asso-ciative and non-associative learning and in the division of labour in the hive. Immunohistochemical studies in-dicate that the ventral unpaired median (VUM) neurones in the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> (SOG) are putatively octopaminergic and therefore might be involved in the octopaminergic modulation of behaviour. In contrast to our knowledge about the behavioural effects of octopam-ine, only one neurone (VUMmx 1) has been related to a behavioural effect (the reward function during olfactory learning). In this study, we have investigated suboeso-phageal VUM neurones with fluorescent dye-tracing techniques and intracellular recordings combined with intracellular staining. Ten different VUM neurones have been found including six VUM neurones innervating neuropile regions of the brain and the SOG exclusively (central VUM neurones) and four VUM neurones with axons in peripheral nerves (peripheral VUM neurones). The central VUM neurones innervate the antennal lobes, the protocerebral lobes (including the lateral horn) and the mushroom body calyces. Of these, a novel mandibular VUM neurone, VUMmd 1, exhibits the same branching pattern in the brain as VUMmx 1 and responds to sucrose and odours in a similar way. The peripheral VUM neurones innervate the antennal and the mandibular nerves. In addition, we describe one labial unpaired median neurone with a dorsal cell body, DUMlb 1.

The result is an overview of the distribution of sixteen neuropeptide families, i. e. pyrokinins, pyrokinin-like peptides, periviscerokinins, tachykinins, allatotropin, accessory gland myotropin, FLRFamide, (short) neuropeptide F, allatostatins, insulin-related peptide co-peptide, ion-transport peptide co-peptide, corazonin, sulfakinin, orcokinin, hypertrehalosaemic hormone and adipokinetic hormones (joining peptides) throughout the locust neuroendocrine system. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Organogenesis was {{observed}} in different age embryos and first instar larvae of Nomia melanderi Cockerell (Halictidae), Megachile rotundata (Fabricius) (Megachilidae), and Bombus griseocollis (DeGeer) (Apidae) (Hymenoptera : Apoidea). It was found that, {{with the exception of}} the ventral nerve cord, comparable organ development had occurred by the beginning of the first instar larvae in all three species. Throughout egg development, Nomia and Megachile showed comparable organogenesis even though their incubation periods were different. Bombus had approximately the same length incubation period as Megachile, but the timing of organogenesis was completely different; Bombus eggs exhibited slow development at first followed by exceedingly rapid organogenesis. The determination of phylogenetic relationships was attempted within the three bee families on the basis of organogenesis. Criteria used were (1) the fusion in both the fibrous core of the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> and the ventral nerve cord ganglia, (2) reduction of rudimentary legs in the first instar larvae, and (3) timing of organ development...|$|E
40|$|Female Drosophila {{with the}} {{spinster}} mutation repel courting males and rarely mate. Here {{we show that}} the non-copulating phenotype can be recapitulated by the elimination of spinster functions from either spin-A or spin-D neuronal clusters, in the otherwise wild-type (spinster heterozygous) female brain. Spin-D corresponds to the olfactory projection neurons with dendrites in the antennal lobe VA 1 v glomerulus that is fruitless-positive, sexually dimorphic and responsive to fly odour. Spin-A is a novel local neuron cluster in the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion,</b> which is known to process contact chemical pheromone information and copula-tion-related signals. A slight reduction in spinster expression to a level with a minimal effect is sufficient to shut off female sexual receptivity if the dominant-negative mechanistic target of rapamycin is simultaneously expressed, although the latter manipulation alone has only a marginal effect. We propose that spin-mediated mechanistic target of rapamycin signal transduction in these neurons is essential for females to accept the courting male...|$|E
40|$|Immunocytochemistry of {{diapause}} hormone (DH) or pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) revealed three {{clusters of}} neurosecretory cells {{present on the}} ventral midline of the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> (SG) of the silkworm: there were 4 cells in the anterior, 6 cells in the medial, and 2 cells in the posterior cluster. Intracellular injection of Lucifer Yellow into an anterior or a medial cell revealed that the cell has a dendritic arborization at the anterior region of the SG and that it projects an axon to the corpus cardiacum (CC) via {{a branch of the}} maxillary nerve and an associated nerve of the CC (NCC-V). A dye-filled posterior cell in the larva projects bilaterally-symmetric dendritic branches to the anterior half of the SG that is to expand laterally to fuse the brain after pupation. The axon of the cell, passing through the brain, enters the NCC 3 to spread varicose terminal branches in the CC and associated nerves of the CC...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} a satiety substance in the hemolymph of the prawn P. japonicus, chemical analysis of saccharide group under different molting stages and feeding conditions was done using paper and thin-layer chromatographies. Hemolymph patterns of saccharides, {{regardless of the}} individual prawn's condition, showed a prominent glucose, and an especially weak reaction which corresponded to maltotriose. The oligosaccharide was identified as maltotriose by the thin-layer chromatography of hemolymphs collected from four prawns. These prawns were injected with glucose solution through the oesophagus into the stomach cavity and kept alive for 4. 5 h. In contrast to glucose, maltotriose showed an inhibitory effect on feeding during the postmolt period after its abdominal injection. Further, maltotriose indicated an accelerative effect on the nerve cells in the ventro-anterior portion of the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion,</b> because {{of the increase in}} their nucleo-cytoplasm ratio after its abdominal injection. As a result, the oligosaccharide maltotriose seemed to perform as a satiety substance which originated in the midgut gland of the prawn...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The POU family genes {{containing}} the POU domain {{are common in}} vertebrates and invertebrates and play critical roles in cell-type-specific gene expression and cell fate determination. Results Har-POU, a new member of the POU gene family, was cloned from the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> of Helicoverpa armigera (Har), and its potential functions {{in the development of}} the central nervous system (CNS) were analyzed. Southern blot analysis suggests that a single copy of this gene is present in the H. armigera haploid genome. Har-POU mRNA is distributed widely in various tissues and expressed highly in the CNS, salivary gland, and trachea. In vitro -translated Har-POU specifically bound canonical octamer motifs on the promoter of diapause hormone and pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (DH-PBAN) gene in H. armigera. Expression of the Har-POU gene is markedly higher in the CNS of nondiapause-destined pupae than in diapause-destined pupae. Expression of the Har-POU gene in diapausing pupae was upregulated quickly by injection of ecdysone. Conclusion Har-POU may respond to ecdysone and bind to the promoter of DH-PBAN gene to regulate pupal development in H. armigera. </p...|$|E
40|$|Chemosensory pheromonal {{information}} regulates {{aggression and}} reproduction in many species, but how pheromonal signals are transduced to reliably produce {{behavior is not}} well understood. Here we demonstrate that the pheromonal signals detected by Gr 32 a-expressing chemosensory neurons to enhance male aggression are filtered through octopamine (OA, invertebrate equivalent of norepinephrine) neurons. Using behavioral assays, we find males lacking both octopamine and Gr 32 a gustatory receptors exhibit parallel delays in the onset of aggression and reductions in aggression. Physiological and anatomical experiments identify Gr 32 a to octopamine neuron synaptic and functional connections in the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion.</b> Refining the Gr 32 a-expressing population indicates that mouth Gr 32 a neurons promote male aggression and form synaptic contacts with OA neurons. By restricting the monoamine neuron target population, we show that three previously identified OA-Fru(M) neurons involved in behavioral choice are among the Gr 32 a-OA connections. Our findings demonstrate that octopaminergic neuromodulatory neurons function as early as a second-order step in this chemosensory-driven male social behavior pathway...|$|E
40|$|In {{the female}} turnip moth, Agrotis segetum, a {{pheromone}} biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) stimulates sex pheromone biosynthesis which exhibits a daily rhythm. Here we show data supporting a circadian rhythm in PBAN {{release from the}} corpora cardiaca, which we propose regulates the endogenous rhythm in sex pheromone biosynthesis. This conclusion is drawn as the observed daily rhythm in PBAN-like immunoreactivity, in the hemolymph is persistent in constant darkness and is phase-shifted by an advanced light:dark cycle. PBAN-like immunoreactivity {{was found in the}} brain, the optic lobe, the <b>suboesophageal</b> <b>ganglion</b> and in the retrocerebral complex. In each hemisphere ca. 10 immunopositive neurons were observed in the pars intercerebralis and a pair of stained somata in the dorso-lateral protocerebrum. A cluster of cells containing PBAN-like immunoreactive material was found in the tritocerebrum and three clusters of such cells were found in the SOG. Their processes reach the corpora cardiaca via nervi corporis cardiaci and the dorsal surface of the corpora allata via the nervi corporis allati. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
