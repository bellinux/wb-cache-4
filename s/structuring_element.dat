50|$|Another {{class of}} {{operations}} {{is based on}} the notion of filtering with a <b>structuring</b> <b>element.</b> The <b>structuring</b> <b>element</b> is binary image, usually small, which is passed over the target image, in a similar manner to a filter in gray scale image processing. Since the pixels can only have two values, the morphological operations are erosion (any unset pixels within the <b>structuring</b> <b>element</b> cause the pixel to be unset) and dilation (any set pixels within the <b>structuring</b> <b>element</b> cause the pixel to be set). Important operations are morphological opening and morphological closing which consist of erosion followed by dilation and dilation followed by erosion, respectively, using the same <b>structuring</b> <b>element.</b> Opening tends to enlarge small holes, remove small objects, and separate objects. Closing retains small objects, removes holes, and joins objects.|$|E
50|$|In the {{discrete}} case, a <b>structuring</b> <b>element</b> {{can also}} be represented {{as a set of}} pixels on a grid, assuming the values 1 (if the pixel belongs to the <b>structuring</b> <b>element)</b> or 0 (otherwise).|$|E
40|$|AbstractSquare and {{circular}} <b>structure</b> <b>elements</b> are presented, {{which are}} used to image de-noising and granularity detection. The different de-noising effects by using the two <b>structure</b> <b>elements</b> were gotten. Moreover, given only one kind of <b>structure</b> <b>elements,</b> we changed {{the size of the}} <b>structure</b> <b>element,</b> then, the difference of de-noising effects is very apparent. It is compared with the detection in one-dimensional direction. The range of detected granules’ size and shape can be expanded by using two dimensional <b>structure</b> <b>elements.</b> Meanwhile, the use of mathematical morphology to a certain extent overcomes the interference of noise. Taking one parasite egg micro image as a simulation example, experimental results show that the image granularities, that we detected by using different <b>structure</b> <b>elements,</b> have great difference, and two-dimensional detection is better than one-dimensional direction detection...|$|R

50|$|Assume we {{are only}} {{interested}} in small blobs on the image {{and we want to}} remove the larger bright objects. In this case, white top-hat transform can remove larger bright objects and remain small blobs by selecting the size of <b>structuring</b> <b>element</b> that is between removed objects and objects of interest. The radius of six largest bright objects are approximate 50 to 100 pixels whereas the radius of objects of interest are around 2 to 4 pixels. In addition, the objects of interest are circular shape so that we choose the <b>structuring</b> <b>element</b> is disk shape with radius 5. However, selecting different shapes and sizes of <b>structuring</b> <b>element</b> will have different resulting images which depend on whether objects fit in <b>structuring</b> <b>element</b> or not.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{recursive}} multiscale new white top-hat (NWTH) filter for small target detection {{in the infrared}} (IR) images. At first, NWTH filter based on white top-hat (WTH) transformation is performed for three scales (<b>structure</b> <b>elements)</b> with wide scale interval. For the discrimination of candidate target and background region, Threshold is calculated by using maximum value of the summation image by NWTH filter. By using this threshold, a <b>structure</b> <b>element</b> is selected by candidate target clutter ratio (CTCR), modification of signal to clutter ratio gain (SCRG). Based on the selected <b>structure</b> <b>element,</b> the other two <b>structure</b> <b>elements</b> are updated with middle scale interval. Through recursive process of procedure mentioned above, optimum three <b>structure</b> <b>elements</b> are obtained. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method is robust and effective than existing morphological methods for the small target detection.

40|$|The {{topology}} of most experimentally determined protein domains {{is defined}} by the relative arrangement of secondary <b>structure</b> <b>elements,</b> i. e. a-helices and b-strands, which make up 50 – 70 % of the sequence. Pairing of b-strands defines the topology of b-sheets. The packing of side chains between a-helices and b-sheets defines the majority of the protein core. Often, limited experimental datasets restrain the position of secondary <b>structure</b> <b>elements</b> while lacking detail with respect to loop or side chain conformation. At the same time the regular structure and reduced flexibility of secondary <b>structure</b> <b>elements</b> make these interactions more predictable when compared to flexible loops and side chains. To determine the topology of the protein in such settings, we introduce a tailored knowledge-based energy function that evaluates arrangement of secondary <b>structure</b> <b>elements</b> only. Based on the amino acid Cb atom coordinates within secondary <b>structure</b> <b>elements,</b> potentials for amino acid pair distance, amino acid environment, secondary <b>structure</b> <b>element</b> packing, b-strand pairing, loop length, radius of gyration, contact order and secondary structure prediction agreement are defined. Separate penalty functions exclude conformations with clashes between amino acids or secondary <b>structure</b> <b>elements</b> and loops that cannot be closed.
