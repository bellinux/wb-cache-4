25|$|The {{aircraft}} was designed in 1935 by Andrzej Anczutin of the RWD bureau, {{as a light}} and economical sports plane. The plane was a wooden low-wing monoplane, with two seats side-by-side in a closed cockpit, powered by 50hp Walter Mikron I <b>straight</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Specifications included: 4-cylinder {{air-cooled}} <b>straight</b> <b>engine</b> in front: 100hp de Havilland Gipsy I or 94hp Cirrus III. Two-blade wooden propeller Szomański of a fixed pitch. Conventional landing gear, with a rear skid. Fuel tank 96 l {{in upper}} central wing section. Fuel consumption - 23.5 l/hour.|$|E
25|$|The PZL.19 was {{designed}} by Jerzy Dąbrowski and Franciszek Misztal in 1931. The plane was of a modern construction, an all-metal cantilever low-wing monoplane with a fixed landing gear and a closed canopy. The crew of two sat in tandem, there also could be fitted one passenger seat behind. It was powered by a 120hp de Havilland Gipsy III <b>straight</b> <b>engine.</b> Three aircraft were built in 1932, the first was flown in May 1932 by Bolesław Orliński. They carried registration SP-AHH, SP-AHI and SP-AHK.|$|E

5000|$|In motorcycling, {{the term}} [...] "in-line" [...] is {{sometimes}} used narrowly, for a <b>straight</b> <b>engine</b> mounted {{in line with}} the frame. A two-cylinder <b>straight</b> <b>engine</b> mounted across the frame is sometimes called a parallel twin. Other times, motorcycling experts treat the terms parallel, straight, and inline as equivalent, and use them interchangeably.|$|E
5000|$|B type {{planes were}} dual-seated unarmed {{reconnaissance}} aircraft built in 1914/15. The biplanes were equipped with Oberursel-Gnome rotary engines, later (B.II and B.III) with Mercedes six-cylinder <b>straight</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2001, General Motors {{introduced}} a new family of <b>straight</b> <b>engines,</b> the Atlas, {{for use in the}} Chevrolet TrailBlazer/GMC Envoy. The straight-six was chosen for development because of the desirable operating characteristics of its self-balanced design.|$|R

50|$|V-engines are {{generally}} more compact than <b>straight</b> <b>engines</b> with cylinders of the same dimensions and number. This effect increases {{with the number of}} cylinders in the engine; there might be no noticeable difference in overall size between V-twin and straight-twin engines while V8 engines are much more compact than straight-eight engines.|$|R
5000|$|This type {{of engine}} should not be {{confused}} with the U engine, which also has two banks of cylinders and two crankshafts, but which is made by combining two similar <b>straight</b> <b>engines.</b> The U engine lacks the advantages the [...] "W" [...] form of the engine has in terms of width and weight.|$|R

Very large multi-cylinder engines, such as those used in a ship or in aviation, may have one rocker cover for each cylinder, to make removal and {{installation}} more manageable.|$|R

50|$|Some <b>straight</b> <b>engines,</b> in {{the strict}} sense, have been {{produced}} for aircraft. Renault produced a straight-four inverted air-cooled motor, which was used on the Stampe SV.4. A similar design was the de Havilland Gipsy series of engines, used on the Tiger Moth and other aircraft. Advantages include improved visibility for the pilot in single-engined craft, and lower center of gravity.|$|R

5000|$|A U {{engine is}} a piston engine {{made up of}} two {{separate}} <b>straight</b> <b>engines</b> (complete with separate crankshafts) joined by gears or chains. It {{is similar to the}} H engine which couples two flat engines. The design is also sometimes described as a [...] "twin bank" [...] or [...] "double bank" [...] engine, although these terms are sometimes used also to describe V engines.|$|R

50|$|Some {{buses and}} trains with <b>straight</b> <b>engines</b> have their engines mounted with {{the row of}} {{cylinders}} horizontal. This differs from a flat engine because it is essentially an inline engine laid on its side. Underfloor engines for buses and diesel multiple units (DMUs) commonly use this design. Such engines may {{be based on a}} conventional upright engine with alterations to make it suitable for horizontal mounting.|$|R
