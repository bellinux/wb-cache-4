40|$|At present {{chemical}} {{sources of}} electricity {{are used as}} power supplies for low-powered electronic equipment. Despite continuous quality improvement (CQI) of chemical sources of electricity they still have some critical faults, such as: relatively high specific overall dimensions, presence of self-discharge, short life and limited shelf life under low temperature storage. Moreover, the chemical source of electricity production is power-consuming, costly and environmentally harmful. The plurality of facts given above stipulates the search for new sources of electric energy eliminating the faults chemical ones possess. Therefore, thermoelectric power supply sources are especially prospective in this respect as thermoelectric generators in general have a long operational life, they are reliable for use in extreme conditions and do not need being changed periodically. It is a well-known fact that <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>converter</b> efficiency depends on the load resistance and the converter resistance matching, which are stipulated by such converter design. The results of calculations of a <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>converter</b> for a medical thermometer power supply are presented in this paper.

This paper discusses two fission-powered concepts: the Heatpipe Power System (HPS) that provides power only, and the Heatpipe Bimodal System (HBS) that provides both power and thermal propulsion. Both concepts have 10 important features. First, only existing technology and recently tested fuel forms are used. Second, fuel can be removed whenever desired, greatly facilitating system fabrication and handling. Third, full electrically heated system testing is possible, with minimal operations required to replace the heaters with fuel and ready the system for launch. Fourth, the systems are passively subcritical during launch accidents. Fifth, a modular approach is used, and most technical issues can be resolved with inexpensive module tests. Sixth, bonds between dissimilar metals are minimized. Seventh, there are no single point failures during power mode operation. Eighth, fuel burnup rate is quite low to help ensure greater than 10 -year system life. Ninth, there are no pumped coolant loops, and the systems can be shut down and restarted without coolant freeze/thaw concerns. Finally, a full ground nuclear test is not needed, and development costs will be low.
