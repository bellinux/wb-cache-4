5|$|Riders protested {{during the}} ninth stage, a criterium in Milan. This protest was {{nominally}} about the overall <b>safety</b> <b>conditions</b> of the stage, and was sparked by life-threatening injuries sustained by Pedro Horrillo the day before. In the protest, riders declined {{to contest the}} stage except for a final sprint finish, a decision that proved controversial with race organizers and fans.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of this stage changed drastically after the dramatic injury sustained by Pedro Horrillo the day before brought attention to <b>safety</b> <b>conditions</b> on this and other courses in the Giro. With the course passing over numerous different surfaces, including tram tracks and cobblestones, the peloton collectively protested racing this course, and as such it was neutralized, with everyone receiving {{the same time as}} the stage winner and no points were awarded for the points classification as had been planned. There were also parked cars at the side of the road in many places, forcing the riders into narrow tunnels to get through them.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the race's {{first week}} and {{beginning}} of its second were three hilly medium-mountain stages. These stages took the Giro through Austria and Switzerland before returning to Italy. Each of these stages took more than five hours to complete, and the rain that fell each day combined with the difficulties presented by the numerous ascents and descents made the courses potentially unsafe in the riders' opinion. This opinion was perhaps validated by the life-threatening injuries sustained by Pedro Horrillo in the eighth stage after he crashed while descending a mountain. While the ninth stage {{was meant to be a}} showy criterium in celebration of this being the 100th anniversary of the Giro d'Italia, the riders collectively protested the <b>safety</b> <b>conditions</b> of that stage and the ones before it. This meant it would be neutralized, with every rider receiving the same finishing time as the stage winner regardless of when they finished.|$|E

40|$|According to the <b>safety</b> <b>condition,</b> {{a subject}} knows that p only {{if she would}} believe that p only if p was true.

The safety theorists have attempted to deal with the problem caused by necessary truths by restricting the <b>safety</b> <b>condition</b> to purely contingent truths and by globalizing the <b>safety</b> <b>condition</b> to a set of propositions.

40|$|This {{study is}} to {{investigate}} the property management services towards <b>safety</b> <b>condition</b> of buildings in Hong Kong. Those property management services were found under a larger framework on property management industry brought by the housing managers including Building Repair & Maintenance, Management of Environment, Property Management Services for Owners / Tenants / Community, Facility Management, Law in Practice, Finance Management, Human Resources Management and other attributes of property management services. The results of the survey implied that the housing managers or practitioners of the property management industry realized those services would brought to the <b>safety</b> <b>condition</b> of the building in Hong Kong with significant impacts, {{but most of them}} would only put their focuses on the facility management or Building Repair & Maintenance.

30|$|Unidirectional two-lane freeway is {{a typical}} and the {{simplest}} form of freeway. The traffic flow characteristics including <b>safety</b> <b>condition</b> on two-lane freeway is of great significance in planning, design, and management of a freeway. Many previous traffic flow models are {{able to figure out}} flow characteristics such as speed, density, delay, and so forth. These models, however, have great difficulty in reflecting <b>safety</b> <b>condition</b> of vehicles. Besides, for the cellular automation, {{one of the most widely}} used microscopic traffic simulation models, its discreteness in both time and space can possibly cause inaccuracy or big errors in simulation results. In this paper, a micro-simulation model of two-lane freeway vehicles is proposed to evaluate characteristics of traffic flow, including <b>safety</b> <b>condition.</b> The model is also discrete in time but continuous in space, and it divides drivers into several groups on the basis of their preferences for overtaking, which makes the simulation more aligned with real situations. Partial test is conducted in this study and results of delay, speed, volume, and density indicate the preliminary validity of our model, based on which the proposed safety coefficient evaluates <b>safety</b> <b>condition</b> under different flow levels. It is found that the results of this evaluation coincide with daily experience of drivers, providing ground for effectiveness of the safety coefficient.|$|R

25|$|Food {{safety is}} {{a major focus of}} food microbiology. Numerous agents of disease, pathogens, are readily {{transmitted}} via food, including bacteria, and viruses. Microbial toxins are also possible contaminants of food. However, microorganisms and their products {{can also be used to}} combat these pathogenic microbes. Probiotic bacteria, including those that produce bacteriocins, can kill and inhibit pathogens. Alternatively, purified bacteriocins such as nisin can be added directly to food products. Finally, bacteriophages, viruses that only infect bacteria, can be used to kill bacterial pathogens. Thorough preparation of food, including proper cooking, eliminates most bacteria and viruses. However, toxins produced by contaminants may not be liable to change to non-toxic forms by heating or cooking the contaminated food due to other <b>safety</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E

In late 1926, the National Aeronautic Association sought to lease Hoover Field from Mitten in order to upgrade it and turn it into Washington's municipal airport. Their goal was to use Hoover Field temporarily while soil was dredged from the Potomac to create new land near Gravelly Point for a much-expanded new municipal airport. But these talks failed. In February 1927, a group of aviators and aviation companies, led by aviation pioneer Henry Berliner, called for the establishment of a new, larger airport on the site of just across Military Road (the southern boundary of Hoover Field). Although no field was built there at this time, an airport (Washington Airport) was built there in 1928.|$|E

Salomon used three cameras in watertight housings that were specially designed. Another special housing was designed for scenes that went from above-water dialogue to below-water dialogue. The filmmakers had {{to figure out how to}} keep the water clear enough to shoot and dark enough to look realistic at 2,000 feet (700 m), which was achieved by floating a thick layer of plastic beads in the water and covering the top of the tank with an enormous tarpaulin. Cameron wanted to see the actors' faces and hear their dialogue, and thus hired Western Space and Marine to engineer helmets which would remain optically clear underwater and installed state-of-the-art aircraft quality microphones into each helmet. <b>Safety</b> <b>conditions</b> were also a major factor with the installation of a decompression chamber on site, along with a diving bell and a safety diver for each actor.|$|E

30|$|According to the results, {{the average}} safety {{coefficient}} {{is the highest}} when the traffic flow is light, and the most dangerous situation takes place when a medium traffic volume is observed. This summary {{is likely to be}} reasonable because when there is a little traffic, the <b>safety</b> <b>condition</b> should be good for a great distance between every two adjacent cars. The safety is not bad under the situation of heavy flow because drivers start to become cautious to avoid crashes and their speed is passively reduced for a fairly high vehicle density. The most dangerous condition on the freeway is that there exists a medium traffic flow while vehicle speed keeps at a quite high level. As a consequence, assuming the proposed model has been proved to be valid in Sect.  3, the average safety coefficient that is put forward is effective in evaluating traffic <b>safety</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|R
