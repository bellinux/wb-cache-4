50|$|CLEVER {{features}} a two-seat tandem layout, a single front wheel, tilting cabin, and a two-wheeled rear engine module. The total vehicle mass is approximately 332 kg (excluding driver and bodywork); with a 75 kg driver the <b>static</b> <b>weight</b> distribution is 39% front and 61% rear. The rear module does not tilt and accounts for approximately 40% of the laden vehicle mass meaning only 60% can be tilted {{to balance the}} vehicle whilst cornering. CLEVER’s wheelbase is 2.4m, as long as many conventional city cars, {{but there are no}} overhangs so total length is under 3m. The track width is just 0.84m giving a total vehicle width of 1.00m.|$|E

30|$|To {{cope with}} the HDR scene {{conditions}} {{in case of a}} stationary video camera, the user is often given the freedom to set the area weights and positions of several zones of interest. The idea is to set higher weights at areas where the interesting foreground objects are likely to appear, for instance, at moving glass doors of the building entrance. In cases when the darker foreground object is present in the zone of interest, it will dominate the measurement as the bright background will be mostly ignored and hence the image display will be optimized for the foreground. This explains why it is important to correctly set the metering zones, or otherwise, the object of interest will be underexposed and will vanish in shadows. We will now describe two general cases of selective weighting: (1) <b>static</b> <b>weighting,</b> when weights (and metering areas) are once selected and set by the user, and (2) dynamic weighting, when weights depend on the content of the metering areas. It will be shown that dynamic weighting, although more complex, provides better results than the <b>static</b> <b>weighting.</b>|$|R

50|$|Maximum {{wheel and}} axle loads are {{specified}} for a particular bridge design so the required fatigue life of steel bridges may be achieved.

With the locomotive's <b>static</b> <b>weight</b> known the amount of overbalance which may be put into each wheel to partially balance the reciprocating parts is calculated. Strains measured in a bridge under a passing locomotive also contain a component from piston thrust. This is neglected in the above calculations for allowable overbalance in each wheel.

Prior to the mix drying, the concrete should be smoothed out on the desired surface. A power screed assists in the smoothing out process by leveling out and/or vibrating the wet mixture. There are friction screeds or [...] "roller" [...] screeds that level the concrete which can be powered by gas, electricity or hydraulics. The compaction performance of the power concrete screed is mainly determined by the centrifugal force of the vibration force and only to a minor extent by the <b>static</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|E
50|$|A subject’s maximum {{voluntary}} contraction (MVC) is recorded {{and used to}} normalize both reference forces and results between subjects.

Results are taken as a mean value of force generated over a time interval set by the researcher. Time intervals are generally one second long and {{near the end of}} the attempt. Reference forces are typically set as a percentage of a subject’s MVC while error is typically reported as a percentage of a subject’s MVC.|$|E

The new FH cab was a logical progression from, for its days spacious but boxy F series cab to more aerodynamically efficient, with much improved ergonomics and much better seating unit while reducing overall weight of the cab by almost 30%. The cabin was extensively tested in a wind tunnel to confirm shape aerodynamics properties to reduce air-drag thus improving fuel efficiency. The cab featured more sharply raked windscreen while wedge shaped sides rounded into front panel at much wider radius corners and the rear vision mirrors were also streamlined.

30|$|In {{contrast}} to this, when the WRR-static configuration is employed (see symbol ▴ in Figure 9), the AF goodput is enhanced, {{being able to}} reach 150 kbps during the 750 -s time point. However, {{at the same time}} point, the EF traffic class is able to reach only 80 kbps of goodput (see Figure 8). As it can be observed, the AF traffic class is assigned with more bandwidth than the EF traffic class, although it has less priority than the EF traffic class. This is mainly because using the WRR algorithm with <b>static</b> <b>weight</b> values, the queues of the higher-priority traffic classes become much more visited, depending of their <b>static</b> <b>weight</b> values. Therefore, using a proportional, static distribution of weights (WEF<WAF), {{it is not possible to}} guarantees the EF high-priority traffic class in the presence of a heavy rain event.|$|E

In this approach the bridge is dynamically modeled using the finite element method and an eigenvalue reduction technique is employed to reduce the dimension of the system. The inverse problem of finding the applied forces from measured responses is then formulated as a least squares problem with Tikhonov regularization. The optimal regularization parameter is solved using the L-curve method. Finally, the static axle loads, impact factors and truck frequencies are obtained from a complete time history of the identified moving forces...|$|R
40|$|Multi-biometrics aims at {{building}} more accurate unified biometric {{decisions based on}} the information provided by multiple biometric sources. Information fusion is used to optimize the process of creating this unified decision. In previous works dealing with score-level multi-biometric fusion, the scores of different biometric sources belonging to the comparison of interest are used to create the fused score. This is usually achieved by assigning <b>static</b> <b>weights</b> for the different biometric sources with more advanced solutions considering supplementary dynamic information like sample quality and neighbours distance ratio. This work proposes embedding score coherence information in the fusion process. This is based on our assumption that a minority of biometric sources, which points out towards a different decision than the majority, might have faulty conclusions and should be given relatively smaller role in the final decision. The evaluation was performed on the BioSecure multimodal biometric database with different levels of simulated noise. The proposed solution incorporates, and was compared to, three baseline <b>static</b> <b>weighting</b> approaches. The enhanced performance induced by including the coherence information within a dynamic weighting scheme in comparison to the baseline solution was shown by the reduction of the equal error rate by 45 % to 85 % over the different test scenarios and proved to maintain high performance when dealing with noisy data...|$|R

These predictions were then tested using a MATLAB model of the rowing stroke. The model simulates an eight man oared rowing shell and determines average shell speed, stroke rating, power per stroke, and time over a 2000 meter race. Several parameters of the rowing model are manipulated {{to determine the effects}} of each source of inefficiency on shell speed. Of the sources tested, three can be attributed to the shell manufacturer, and the others can be attributed to the rowers themselves. The sources of inefficiency tested are wetted surface area, coefficient of friction, dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>weight,</b> stroke length, slide acceleration, and stroke rating. The effects on shell velocity were normalized to determine which sources resulted in the greatest inefficiencies.

30|$|The IEEE 802.16 {{standard}} {{was designed to}} provide quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees for various classes of traffic with diverse QoS requirements. Packet-scheduling algorithms {{play a critical role}} in providing such guarantees. Weighted round robin (WRR) is one of the most commonly used scheduling algorithms, because of its simplicity and low computational overhead. However, it suffers from performance degradation under bursty traffic conditions because of the <b>static</b> <b>weights</b> used to determine packet transmissions. We propose a new packet-scheduling discipline for downlink traffic in 802.16 networks to improve performance in such situations. It dynamically determines the weight of each queue in the various classes based on the current traffic characteristics using the <b>static</b> WRR <b>weight</b> at the beginning of each base station round. The goal is not only to reduce the average delay and packet loss but also to improve average throughput. Simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm load-aware weighted round robin (LAWRR), and show that it reduces average delay and packet loss, as well as it improves average throughput compared with WRR. The effectiveness of LAWRR running under fixed buffer sizes is also investigated.|$|R
30|$|Excessive allocation: as <b>static</b> <b>weight</b> {{assignment}} schemes {{are unaware}} of the current network conditions, {{in the case of}} excessive allocation, a node is given transmission opportunities typically at the cost of suppressing other nodes even if it has no packets to transmit. This causes the channel resources to be wasted. The severity of this situation can be identified by keeping a counter for the number of slots each node wastes. A dynamic weighting scheme which tries to alleviate this problem should periodically measure the amount of waste caused by the most recent weight assignments and reset those counters.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{prosthetic}} weight-bearing tolerance in the standing position to the dynamic vertical ground reaction forces (VGRF) experienced during walking in elderly dysvascular trans-tibia 1 amputees. Ten unilateral trans-tibia 1 amputees attending an amputee clinic (mean age = 67 * 6. 5 years) were selected as subjects. Selection criteria were the level of amputation, age, medical fitness to participate and informed consent. Each participant completed five trials of standing (<b>static)</b> <b>weight</b> bearing measurement followed by 10 walking (dynamic) trials on a 10 m level walkway, five trials for each limb. <b>Static</b> <b>weight</b> bearing (SWB) was measured using standard bathroom scales. Dynamic weight bearing (DWB) was measured during gait using a Kistler multichannel force platform. T-tests for dependent means indicated that the forces borne in prosthetic single limb stance (mean= 0. 97 + 0. 03 times body weight (BW)) were significantly lower than the forces borne by the prosthetic limb during the first peak (weight acceptance) VGRF (mean = 1. 08 d. 08 BW; t =- 4. 999; p = 0. 001) and significantly higher than the midstance VGRF(mean = 0. 82 d. 07 BW; t = 5. 401; p~ 0. 001). However, there was no significant difference between SWB and the second peak (push-off) VGRF generated by the prosthetic limb during walking (mean = 0. 96 k 0. 03 BW).
