5|$|Amid their {{prolific}} reggae output as sessions musicians, solo artists, {{and production}} duo, <b>Sly</b> and Robbie—drummer <b>Sly</b> Dunbar and bassist Robbie Shakespeare—opened their own record label Taxi Records and attained a distribution deal with Island Records {{during the early}} 1980s. After Island founder and executive Chris Blackwell hired them to work with singer Grace Jones, the duo developed a more sparse, robotic production style with funk and dub influences. This deviated from their past reggae work, {{as well as the}} genre's roots sound and light rhythms. <b>Sly</b> and Robbie recorded primarily at Blackwell's Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas with state-of-the-art equipment, which led to Dunbar's experimentation with electronic drums and drum machines.|$|E

Detta abducted Stiletto, spurring Sly's search. Her love unrequited, Fatima went into his office one night to leave a note of resignation. <b>Sly</b> burst in with news of Stiletto's location, and he and Fatima pursued Detta across Anachronox by flying car. <b>Sly</b> lost control, wrecking it and accidentally killing Fatima. Suffering from major depression, <b>Sly</b> ran up debts with Detta to pay for Fatima's revival inside the LifeCursor.|$|E
5|$|After {{releasing}} The Sting (1986) and Electro Reggae (1987) {{as members}} of their Taxi Gang band, <b>Sly</b> and Robbie enlisted Laswell again to work on Rhythm Killers. They recorded the album {{over a period of}} three months at Quad Recording in New York City. Before entering the studio, <b>Sly</b> and Robbie originally had planned music and demos to work with, but scrapped them after Chris Blackwell of Island discouraged the idea. Blackwell wanted the duo to come up with original material at the studio, as they had been known to do since their early years in Jamaica.|$|E

5|$|There's a Riot Goin' On is {{the fifth}} studio album by American band <b>Sly</b> and the Family Stone. It was {{released}} on November 20, 1971, by Epic Records. The album was recorded during 1970 and 1971 at Record Plant Studios in Sausalito, California, with sessions dominated by band frontman <b>Sly</b> Stone {{during a period of}} drug use and intra-group tension. There's a Riot Goin' On embraced a darker and more challenging sound than the optimistic psychedelic soul style of the group's previous records, making use of hard funk rhythms, primitive drum machines, excessive overdubbing, and unconventional mixing techniques. The album's planned title was Africa Talks to You, but it was retitled in response to Marvin Gaye's album What's Going On (1971), released five months before.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of funk records such as <b>Sly</b> and the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On (1971) and James Brown's late 1960s and early 1970s singles, Gaye's Let's Get It On helped further the funk genre's reach and {{influence}} in the music industry, as well as increase its mainstream appeal. Several contemporary R musicians, such as Prince, D'Angelo, and R. Kelly, were greatly influenced by its vintage sound and seductive themes, incorporating much of Gaye's musical style into their music.|$|E

The reason for the breakup is shrouded in conjecture; some believe that there were disagreements amongst Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, and Marley concerning performances, while others claim that Wailer and Tosh simply preferred solo work.|$|E

5|$|After {{their work}} with Black Uhuru and that group's line-up change, <b>Sly</b> and Robbie pursued more {{international}} music endeavors. They branched out into cross-genre experiments with a conceptual, ensemble-oriented approach, while developing a mentorship with record producer Bill Laswell, whom they met through Blackwell and by working on Mick Jagger's 1985 album She's the Boss. In 1985, they collaborated with Laswell on their album Language Barrier, which had guest contributions from Herbie Hancock, Bob Dylan, Afrika Bambaataa, and Manu DiBango. Its recording developed from a track the duo had revisited from their work on the soundtrack to the 1983 film Never Say Never Again. The track had been done with electronic drums at Compass Point Studios, but scrapped as a rhythm track for later use.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the lead}} of Hendrix in rock, psychedelia began to {{influence}} African American musicians, particularly {{the stars of the}} Motown label. This psychedelic soul was influenced by the civil rights movement, giving it a darker and more political edge than much psychedelic rock. Building on the funk sound of James Brown, it was pioneered from about 1968 by <b>Sly</b> and the Family Stone and The Temptations. Acts that followed them into this territory included Edwin Starr and the Undisputed Truth. George Clinton's interdependent Funkadelic and Parliament ensembles and their various spin-offs took the genre to its most extreme lengths making funk almost a religion in the 1970s, producing over forty singles, including three in the US top ten, and three platinum albums.|$|E
5|$|The American River Division {{is located}} in north-central California, {{on the east side}} of the Great Central Valley.

The division is further divided into three units: the Folsom, <b>Sly</b> Park and Auburn-Folsom South. The American River Division stores water in the American River watershed, to both provide water supply for local settlements, and supply it to the rest of the system. The dams also are an important flood control measure. Hydroelectricity is generated at Folsom and Nimbus dams, and marketed to the Western Area Power Administration.|$|E
40|$|We report {{classical}} {{molecular dynamics}} (MD) simulations and combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations to elucidate the catalytic {{mechanism of the}} rate-determining amine oxidation step in the lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD 1) -catalyzed demethylation of the histone tail lysine (H 3 K 4), with flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) acting as cofactor. The oxidation of substrate lysine (<b>sLys)</b> involves the cleavage of an α-CH bond accompanied by the transfer of a hydride ion equivalent to FAD, leading to an imine intermediate. This hydride transfer pathway is shown to be clearly favored for <b>sLys</b> oxidation over other proposed mechanisms, including the radical (or single-electron transfer) route as well as carbanion and polar-nucleophilic mechanisms. MD simulations on six NVT ensembles (covering different protonation states of <b>sLys</b> and K 661 {{as well as the}} K 661 M mutant) identify two possible orientations of the reacting <b>sLys</b> and FAD subunits (called “downward” and “upward”). Calculations at the QM(B 3 LYP-D/ 6 - 31 G*) /CHARMM 22 level provide molecular-level insights into the mechanism, helping to understand how LSD 1 achieves the activation of the rather inert methyl-CH bond in a metal-free environment. Factors such as proper alignment of <b>sLys</b> (downward orientation), transition-state stabilization (due to the protein environment and favorable orbital interactions), and product stabilization via adduct formation are found to be crucial for facilitating the oxidative α-CH bond cleavage. The current study also sheds light on the role of important active-site residues (Y 761, K 661, and W 695) and of the conserved water-bridge motif. The steric influence of Y 761 helps to position the reaction partners properly, K 661 is predicted to get deprotonated prior to substrate binding and to act as an active-site base that accepts a proton from <b>sLys</b> to enable the subsequent amine oxidation, and the water bridge that is stabilized by K 661 and W 695 mediates this proton transfer...|$|R

5|$|The plan seemed ill-conceived and {{suggests}} that Narborough was obsessed {{by the possibility of}} treasure. It is also possible that Phips was being used in a complex way, with the <b>sly</b> intention that HMS Rose would act as a noisy decoy for his more important treasure hunt. Unlike the Falcon and Bonetta, Phips was not sent directly to search near Hispaniola where Narborough (correctly) believed a great treasure lay buried. Phips' instructions were not kept secret but were signed by the entire crew, thereby broadcasting their designs through the harbor and shipyards. On July 13, 1683, the articles of agreement (see image) were signed by Phips and seven other crew members, in the presence of Narborough and Haddock.|$|E

5|$|Born to a Pentecostal-minister father, D'Angelo {{was brought}} up to an early {{appreciation}} of gospel music, while his mother, a jazz enthusiast, {{introduced him to the}} musical complexities of trumpeter Miles Davis and the funk and soul music of the 1970s. In addition to old gospel records, these factors inspired him during the making of Brown Sugar, as D'Angelo drew upon his roots of traditional gospel and soul, and infused the sound of contemporary R and hip hop music to create a stylistically unique and soulful sound for the album. The album has been noted by critics for its classic soul elements and influences, as well as the sound of live instruments and organic grooves, which are reminiscent of the work of Stevie Wonder and <b>Sly</b> & the Family Stone. Its production contrasts the producer-driven and digital approach of contemporary R {{at the time of its}} release.|$|E
