She recommended that applicants not try to come across as a [...] "preppy well-off kid" [...] but downplay parental status. Advisors Mamlet and VanDeVelde suggest that students proactively try to explain an unusual grade, such as a low grade in a core course.

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{an attempt to}} provide future teachers {{with an opportunity to}} practice evaluating and responding to <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> through a collaboration among members of an NCTE committee, a blended writing pedagogies course composed of education, creative writing, and professional <b>writing</b> <b>students,</b> and middle school teachers and their students in two states. Students’ texts were drawn from the NCTE’s “Promising Young Writers” contest, for which college students acted as judges and provided feedback to the middle school writers. We argue that the experience of responding to actual student writers about the texts they had submitted provided potentially important opportunities for teacher candidates to reimagine their roles in reading and then responding to <b>student</b> <b>writing.</b> The perspectives of students from other majors offered teacher candidates other ways of evaluating and responding to <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> than those they had initially applied. This experience of evaluating and responding to actual <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> also allowed teacher candidates to connect theories from course readings to practices of teaching writing...|$|R

40|$|A {{proposal}} for researching standards of <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> in UK higher education was {{put forward by}} Professor David Wray and Professor Jeremy Treglown at the University of Warwick in 1999. The proposal was prompted by ‘increasing national concern about a supposed falling-off {{in areas such as}} grammar, spelling and punctuation, as well as in more sophisticated aspects of writing’. 1 The purpose of the project was to lay preliminary groundwork for researching <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> in higher education and for determining how writing skills can best be taught at university level. The project gained support, {{in the form of a}} Post-Doctoral Fellowship, from the Royal Literary Fund. Because it was motivated by the perception of a ‘crisis’ in the <b>writing</b> skills of <b>students,</b> the original approach to the project was to investigate <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> from a perspective of measurable standards – such as standards of grammar. Throughout the course of the research, however, this approach was shown to be less productive for studying <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> than other emerging research methodologies. The focus of the project changed, therefore, as the researcher, Dr. Lisa Ganobcsik-Williams, gained knowledge of higher education writing pedagogy as an already emergent field supported by an active and varied research culture. The report begins by examining the context in which the project arose: the ‘literacy crisis’ in <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> that is currently perceived in UK higher education. Section Two of the report discusses a survey of university staff perspectives on <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> that was undertaken as a starting point for the research, and also illustrates the challenges of attempting to conduct a comparative study of standards of <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> across decades. Section Three of the report, which surveys existing Academic Writing scholarship and pedagogical approaches, represents the project’s shift from a deficit to a developmental method of laying groundwork for the study of <b>student</b> <b>writing,</b> and posits a ‘whole institution’ approach to supporting student-writers. Section Four concludes the report by making recommendations for future funding in the area of Academic Writing pedagogy and research...|$|R

50|$|Indirect writing {{assessments}} typically {{consist of}} multiple choice tests on grammar, usage, and vocabulary. Examples include high-stakes standardized tests {{such as the}} ACT, SAT, and GRE, which are most often used by colleges and universities for admissions purposes. Other indirect assessments, such as Compass and Accuplacer, are used to place students into remedial or mainstream writing courses. Direct writing assessments, like the timed essay test, require at least one sample of <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> andare viewed by many writing assessment scholars as more valid than indirect tests because they are assessing actual samples of writing. Portfolio assessment, which generally consists of several pieces of <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> written {{over the course of}} a semester, began to replace timed essays during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Portfolio assessment is viewed as being even more valid than timed essay tests because it focuses on multiple samples of <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> that have been composed in the authentic context of the classroom. Portfolios enable assessors to examine multiple samples of <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> and multiple drafts of a single essay.|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the essays {{produced}} by students in two different disciplines, geography and history of science, to examine how far their writing may {{be affected by the}} nature of their previous disciplinary study. In particular, it considers the students' use of Theme, as a feature that is susceptible to discipline-specific variation. The paper questions a view of learning to write within a discipline as a simple unidirectional process. Our research suggests, firstly, that <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> demonstrates at least some disciplinary variation, such that what is valued in one context cannot be assumed to be valued equally in another context, and secondly, that students' success in writing within one disciplinary area may be affected by what they may have learned about writing through previous academic study. These results highlight the need for further cross-disciplinary research into <b>student</b> <b>writing,</b> in order to disentangle both the features that characterize good <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> in different disciplines (which are not necessarily the same as in professional academic writing), and the way that different influences, from a range of previous experiences, combine to shape a <b>student's</b> <b>writing</b> in any particular context. Without such understandings, {{it would be difficult to}} design effective strategies for supporting <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> in the disciplines...|$|R
