40|$|Effective {{investment}} {{is a factor}} for long-term company development. As enhancement of investment attractiveness is a required condition for economic growth and improvement of living standards, {{it needs to be}} on the agenda at government and company level. The article’s objective is to study investment attractiveness of food industries in Ukraine over 2012 – 2015. Investment attractiveness of food industries can be measured by indicators of liquidity, financial sustainability, and profit rate. Basically, food industries in Ukraine are attractive for investment, which is demonstrated by assessment of the financial indicators. The investment attractiveness worsened slightly in 2015 compared with 2014. The essential problems faced by food industries are shortage of internal funds and negative profit rate of all the activities, assets and own capital. Official statistical data and software package SPSS are used to build the dendrogram, allowing for dividing food industries by level of investment attractiveness into three groups: industries with high, medium and low level of investment attractiveness. It is found that meat industry is the one with the highest level of investment attractiveness. Also, investors should look positively at food-canning industry, oil and animal fat industry, flour-milling industry, <b>starch</b> <b>and</b> <b>starch</b> <b>products</b> industry, <b>and</b> other foods industry. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{analysis}} of structure of starch containing raw materials processing in Russia Federation {{is provided in}} the article. There was noted an increase in volumes of corn and wheat processing, however the share of processed potato is still low (below 4 %). It was established that Russian <b>starch</b> <b>products</b> <b>and</b> <b>starch</b> sweeteners {{are on the same}} level on quality as best European samples and they are very competitive. Market demand in crystalline glucose for food and medical purposes (over 30 thous. tons) is fully covered by import. The volume of import of modified starches exceeds 80 % of total consumption. The biggest volume of import among native starches belongs to potato starch – over 60 %. The article provides suggestions on import substitution of mentioned <b>starch</b> <b>products.</b> The growth of starch production in Russia was accompanied by concentration of production at large enterprises. So, in 2013 over 90 % of glucose syrup was produced at six enterprises, over 80 % of dry starch – at five enterprises. Efficiency of corn <b>and</b> wheat processing into <b>starch</b> <b>and</b> <b>starch</b> <b>products</b> is achieved by production and selling of co-products (dry gluten, gluten, corn germ or corn oil, corn extract, feed <b>products).</b> Development of <b>starch</b> sweeteners production from starch could be achieved by expanding the consumption areas of different kinds of glucose syrup and production of glucose-fructose syrups as full substitute of sugar, providing import substitution of sugar, crystalline glucose of food and medicine purpose, deep processing of glucose into polyols (sorbit, maltit), polylactites, aminoacids...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{proportion}} of starch disappearing {{from the small}} intestinal lumen is generally lower in ruminants than in monogastric animals, and {{there are indications that}} the starch digestion capacity in ruminants is limited. Objectives: Milk-fed calves were used to study the rate-limiting enzyme in <b>starch</b> hydrolysis <b>and</b> to quantify <b>starch</b> fermentation in ruminants. Methods: Forty male Holstein-Friesian calves were fed milk replacer containing either lactose (control) or 1 of 4 corn <b>starch</b> <b>products.</b> The following <b>starch</b> <b>products</b> differed in the enzyme ratios required for their complete hydrolysis to glucose: gelatinized <b>starch</b> [a-amylase <b>and</b> (iso) maltase], maltodextrin [(iso) maltase and a-amylase], maltodextrin with a- 1, 6 -branching (isomaltase, maltase, and a-amylase), and maltose (maltase). In the adaptation period, calves were stepwise exposed to an increasing dose of the <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> for 14 wk to allow maximal adaptation of all enzyme systems involved. In the experimental period, apparent total tract <b>and</b> ileal <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> disappearance, total tract <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> fermentation, <b>and</b> a-amylase, maltase, and isomaltase activities were determined at 18 % inclusion of the <b>starch</b> <b>product.</b> Results: Maltase <b>and</b> isomaltase activities in the brush border did not increase for any of the <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> treatments. Luminal a-amylase activity was lower in the proximal (3. 9 ± 3. 2 and 2. 7 ± 1. 7 U/mg Co for control <b>and</b> <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> calves, respectively) but greater in the distal small intestine of starch-fed calves than in control calves (0. 0 ± 0. 0 and 6. 4 ± 1. 5 U/mg Co for control <b>and</b> <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> calves, respectively; means ± SEs for control and means ± pooled SEMs for <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> treatments). Apparent ileal (61. 6 % ± 6. 3 %) and total tract (99. 1 % ± 0. 4 %) <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> disappearance did not differ between <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> treatments, suggesting that maltase activity limits starch digestion in ruminants.

40|$|Corn (Zea Mays L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} cereal crops in the world and the main crop in the United States. Starch is the most abundant component of the corn kernels and the most valuable fraction recovered by wet milling of corn. The amount wet milled from a sample is an indication of the millability or ease with which kernel components are separated. New hybrids with high grain yield <b>and</b> higher <b>starch,</b> protein, or oil contents have been developed and are available to corn growers. However, these hybrids are the result of crossing adapted inbred lines and rarely have corn lines from exotic germplasm been crossed with elite inbreds to develop new and useful breeding lines. Studying the physical, compositional, and wet-milling properties of new inbred lines and their hybrids, as well as the proximate composition of recovered fractions, needs to be done at the laboratory level before these materials are of value to the corn processing industry. The present study was conducted to: (i) determine whether Corn Belt lines introgressed with exotic materials have appropriate wet-milling characteristics, and (ii) determine the expression of heterosis in physical, compositional, and wet-milling characteristics of the F 1 and F 2 generations of hybrids from their crosses with adapted inbred lines. Ten inbred lines from the Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) project introgressed with exotic germplasm from Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Florida, and Uruguay were grouped as high <b>starch</b> <b>and</b> low <b>starch</b> exotic lines (HSEL <b>and</b> LSEL) according to the <b>starch</b> yield produced <b>and</b> were crossed to three commercial adapted inbred lines used as testers. B 73, Mo 17, and their hybrid were used as controls. The 10 inbred lines from GEM and the F 1 and F 2 generations of these 30 experimental hybrids were analyzed using both Near-Infrared Transmittance (NIT) and a 100 -g wet-milling procedure. AR 227 and CU 562, two lines of exotic origin, had similar or better <b>starch</b> yield <b>and</b> <b>starch</b> recovery than B 73 and the other adapted inbred lines, which indicates that these lines can potentially be used to improve the proportion of extractable starch present in the kernels of their hybrids. There was no significant difference between groups of hybrids from high <b>and</b> low <b>starch</b> lines, but the effect of lines and testers, as well as the interaction effect of lines by tester (hybrids), were statistically significant in both the F 1 and F 2 generations and produced great variation among physical, compositional, and wet-milling characteristics of the experimental hybrids. Exotic inbred lines from Argentina, Chile, Cuba, and Florida had better wet-milling characteristics when crossed to Tester 3, which indicates that the original accessions (AR 16035, CH 05015, CUBA 117, and FS 8 B(T)) used in GEM can be a valuable source of value-added characteristics if a breeding program to increase the extractable starch of corn hybrids incorporates breeding lines from these accessions as part of it s germplasm base. Negative heterosis for <b>starch</b> content <b>and</b> positive heterosis for protein content was expressed, which led to negative heterosis values for <b>starch</b> yield <b>and</b> <b>starch</b> recovery <b>and</b> poor wet-milling properties of the F 1 generation of experimental hybrids. Positive mid-parent <b>and</b> high-parent heterosis for <b>starch</b> content <b>and</b> negative values for protein content were expressed by the F 2 hybrids. This led to positive heterosis values for <b>starch</b> yield <b>and</b> <b>starch</b> recovery <b>and</b> better wet-milling properties for some hybrid grain samples with exotic germplasm compared to B 73 xMo 17 hybrid grain. There was a positive correlation between <b>starch</b> content <b>and</b> <b>starch</b> yield <b>and</b> <b>starch</b> recovery <b>and</b> a strong negative correlation between protein content <b>and</b> <b>starch</b> yield <b>and</b> <b>starch</b> recovery. This indicated that genotypes with high <b>starch</b> <b>and</b> low protein contents produce hybrids with better millability. NIT may be used as a predictive tool to screen early progeny for high <b>starch</b> <b>and</b> low protein contents, which are associated with higher <b>starch</b> yield <b>and</b> <b>starch</b> recovery, to save time and costs in a corn breeding program directed to the improvement of the wet-milling efficiency of corn...|$|R
