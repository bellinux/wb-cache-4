25|$|As {{explained}} above, tectonic plates {{may include}} continental crust or oceanic crust, and most plates contain both. For example, the African Plate includes {{the continent and}} parts of the floor of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The distinction between oceanic crust and continental crust is based on their modes of formation. Oceanic crust is formed at sea-floor spreading centers, and continental crust is formed through arc volcanism and accretion of terranes through tectonic processes, though some of these terranes may contain ophiolite sequences, which are pieces of oceanic crust considered {{to be part of the}} continent when they exit the <b>standard</b> <b>cycle</b> of formation and spreading centers and subduction beneath continents. Oceanic crust is also denser than continental crust owing to their different compositions. Oceanic crust is denser because it has less silicon and more heavier elements ("mafic") than continental crust ("felsic"). As a result of this density stratification, oceanic crust generally lies below sea level (for example most of the Pacific Plate), while continental crust buoyantly projects above sea level (see the page isostasy for explanation of this principle).|$|E

5000|$|The {{reason for}} {{adopting}} 26 tpi, is brass tube has a relatively similar wall thickness {{irrespective of the}} outside diameter of the tube, therefore as BSW thread depths {{are determined by the}} threads per inch, a lower tpi would reduce the strength of the tube or cut right through it. Brass tube threads can be confused with the British <b>Standard</b> <b>Cycle</b> thread, one of which that is most common is also 26 tpi.

40|$|In this paper, we will {{investigate}} a harmonic cycle (discrete harmonic form). With a CW-complex, we can construct the combinatorial Laplacian operator. The kernel of the operator is the harmonic space, {{the set of}} harmonic cycles, and is isomorphic to its homology due to combinatorial Hodge theory. We will introduce four concepts; cycletree, unicyclization, winding number map, and <b>standard</b> harmonic <b>cycle.</b> A cycletree is the disjoint union of a spanning tree and an edge on a given graph. A unicyclization consists of a graph and information substituting for faces. Then, we will define the winding number map and the <b>standard</b> harmonic <b>cycle,</b> and prove related properties. Finally, we will show a relation between the winding number and the inner product with the <b>standard</b> harmonic <b>cycle.</b> Then, we will see the <b>standard</b> harmonic <b>cycle</b> is actually a harmonic cycle. In other words, we give a combinatorial interpretation on a harmonic cycle...|$|R
40|$|In {{many parts}} of the world car {{manufacturers}} are required by law to state the fuel economy performance of their vehicles when undertaking one or more <b>Standard</b> Drive <b>Cycles</b> such as the Urban and Extra Urban test cycle definitions required in Western Europe. Such <b>Standard</b> Drive <b>Cycles</b> have their roots in obscure vehicle testing undertaken decades ago in the USA, and no physical test track exists in Europe which enables the precise re-creation of these test characteristics. Furthermore, the fundamental validity of these test cycles as a means of gauging and comparing passenger car fuel economy is seldom considered. This paper documents the early stages of a research project which aims to segment the <b>Standard</b> Drive <b>Cycle</b> definitions into a series of operating characteristic windows which can then be searched for and automatically extracted from general driving behaviour of a car on the road, and thereafter concatenated to re-creating a real-world equivalent of the <b>Standard</b> Drive <b>Cycle</b> without the need for rolling road or laboratory testing...|$|R

50|$|A {{freewheel}} (also {{known as}} a block) consists of either a single sprocket or a set of sprockets mounted on a body which contains an internal ratcheting mechanism and mounts on a threaded hub. Threaded rear hubs were available in different thread patterns depending on the country of manufacture, French and British threads being the most common. British C.E.I. (Cycle Engineers Institute) thread was adopted as the international standard and {{is now known as}} B.S.C. (British <b>Standard</b> <b>Cycle).</b> It is a standardized right-hand thread (1.375 x 24 TPI) onto which a standard freewheel is screwed.

5000|$|British <b>Standard</b> <b>Cycle</b> (BSC or BSCy) is a British Imperial {{screw thread}} standard. Unlike other major British {{imperial}} thread standards (British Standard Whitworth and British Standard Fine) the thread runs at a 60 degrees {{rather than a}} 55 degrees angle. All sizes [...] inch and larger use 26 threads per inch (tpi), making them similar to 1 mm ISO threads, which are 25.4 per inch and also run at a 60 degrees angle. It was originally used with both bicycles and motorcycles. However it is now believed to be obsolete in motorcycle manufacture. In the bicycle industry it is still found on virtually all bottom bracket threads and the wheel axles of low-end models manufactured in China.|$|E
50|$|Each AFC team {{plays the}} other teams in their {{respective}} division twice (home and away) during the regular season, in addition to 10 other games assigned to their schedule by the NFL. Two of these games are assigned {{on the basis of}} a particular team's final divisional standing from the previous season. The remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions. This assignment shifts each year and will follow a <b>standard</b> <b>cycle.</b> Using the 2012 regular season schedule as an example, each team in the AFC West plays against every team in the AFC North and NFC South. In this way, non-divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents - the exception being the two games assigned based on the team's prior-season divisional standing.|$|E

40|$|The main {{substantive}} {{finding of}} the recent structural vector autoregression literature with a difference specification of hours (DSVAR) is that technology shocks lead to a fall in hours. Researchers have used these results to argue that <b>standard</b> business <b>cycle</b> models in which technology shocks leads to a rise in hours should be discarded. We test the DSVAR approach by asking the following: Is the specification derived from this approach misspecified when the data is generated by the very model the literature is trying to discard, namely the <b>standard</b> business <b>cycle</b> model? We find that it is misspecified. Moreover, this misspecification {{is so great that}} it leads to mistaken inferences that are quantitatively large. We show that the other popular specificationwhichusesthelevelofhours (LSVAR) is also misspecified with respect to the <b>standard</b> business <b>cycle</b> model. We argue that an alternative approach, the business cycle accounting approach, is a more fruitful technique for data analysis...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} ways to build a velomobile. One modern design is [...] "body-on-frame", in which a velomobile is made from a not-faired cycle plus a body. A <b>standard</b> <b>cycle</b> may be used, but often a custom cycle is used with special {{fittings}} to mount the body; the use of special fittings tends to improve fit and durability, and can also reduce weight. Body-on-frame construction allows flexible configuration: the body may be of any construction, as it {{does not need to be}} self-supporting, and various bodies can be used with various frames. Also, the body may be removed so the cycle alone can be used. However, the overall weight of body-on-frame is often higher than alternatives, as the body does have some intrinsic strength, yet this is not used to reduce the weight of the frame.|$|E
50|$|After {{retiring}} from the Australasian professional racing circuit, Pither, who {{had been living in}} Sydney, returned to Christchurch in 1903. There he set up the <b>Standard</b> <b>Cycle</b> Works in Columbo Street as an engineer, making first bicycles, then small engines, before moving to the Southland town of Invercargill about 1906. He is reputed to have driven there in car he made himself. For a time Pither worked for G W Woods and Co, until in 1908 he set up his own business in the former YMCA building in Kelvin Street. His engineering shop repaired automobiles and made small agricultural and boat engines under the brand 'Peerless'. In 1909 Pither was approached by Simon McDonald about constructing an aircraft to his patented design. A suitable shed was leased and construction commenced with a flight planned for early 1910. McDonald was credited with designing the aircraft and both were constructing it.|$|E
