50|$|A network {{implementing}} NCS {{is designed}} {{according to the}} media gateway control protocol architecture for interconnecting a packet network with the traditional {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN). This architecture physically decomposes the functionality of providing complete end-to-end multimedia telecommunication sessions into several discrete components, notably a media gateway (MG) located at the customer premises that performs the physical translation between analog voice or video streams to packetized digital data, and a media gateway controller (MGC) which is a centralized server that controls typically many media gateways and manages the complexity of call setup, resource negotiation, call routing, and tear-down. In addition, the architecture also uses <b>signaling</b> <b>gateways</b> to the traditional telecommunication channels, such as SS7-based networks.|$|R
