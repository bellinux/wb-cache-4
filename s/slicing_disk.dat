Controlling the residual stress distribution is necessary since the compressive residual stress at the surface may improve fatigue life though the tensile residual stress at the center may reduce the strength.

The disk method has been widely used in predicting the roll residual stress by measuring the stress of the thin <b>sliced</b> <b>disk</b> from the roll.

In {{addition}} the Heegaard–Floer concordance invariants τ, {{developed by}} Ozsváth-Szabó, and δ, developed by Manolescu and Owens, vanish on K. For a knot K ⊂ S 3, the Bing double, denoted B(K), is the two component link illustrated schematically in Figure 1.

K Figure 1. Bing doubling, B(K) A link in S 3 is called slice if its components bound disjoint locally flat disks in the 4 –ball, a notion that is sometimes called strongly slice. The slicing of links formed via the construction of Bing doubling has been a focus of recent research, in part because of its connection to topological surgery in dimension four; see for instance [11, 12, 13]. Specifically, Bing doubling plays an essential role in the study of link theory, and especially in link concordance [7, 14, 22]. Harvey [8] and Teichner (unpublished) proved that if B(K) is slice, then the integral of the signature function of K over the unit circle is zero.

Our models are two dimensional, representing radial-vertical <b>slices</b> through the <b>disk,</b> and include sheared background rotation of the gas, vertical stratification, heating and cooling to yield temperatures T ∼ 10 − 104 K, and conduction that resolves thermal instabilities on our numerical grid.

Using a combination of local non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations and radiative transfer calculations, tailored to properties of the disk around HD 163296, we assess the ability of ALMA to detect turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI). Our local simulations show that the MRI produces small-scale turbulent velocity fluctuations that increase in strength with height above the mid-plane. For a set of simulations at different disk radii, we fit a Maxell-Boltzmann distribution to the turbulent velocity and construct a turbulent broadening parameter as a function of radius and height. We input this broadening into radiative transfer calculations to quantify observational signatures of MRI-driven disk turbulence. We find that the ratio of the peak line flux to the flux at line center is a robust diagnostic of turbulence that is only mildly degenerate with systematic uncertainties in disk temperature. For the CO(3 - 2) line, which we expect to probe the most magnetically active <b>slice</b> of the <b>disk</b> column, variations in the predicted peak-to-trough ratio between our most and least turbulent models span a range of approximately 15 %. Additional independent constraints can be derived from the morphology of spatially resolved line profiles, and we estimate the resolution required to detect turbulence on different spatial scales.

We focus on HII region effects by applying intense heating in dense, self-gravitating regions. Our models are two-dimensional radial-vertical <b>slices</b> through the <b>disk,</b> and include sheared background rotation, vertical stratification, heating and cooling to yield temperatures T~ 10 - 10 ^ 4 K, and thermal conduction. We separately vary the gas surface density Sigma, the stellar volume density rho_*, and the local angular rotation rate Omega to explore environmental dependencies, and analyze the steady-state properties of each model. Among other statistics, we evaluate turbulent amplitudes, virial ratios, Toomre Q parameters including turbulence, and the mass fractions at different densities. We find that the dense gas (n> 100 cm^- 3) has turbulence levels similar to observed GMCs and virial ratios ~ 1 - 2. The Toomre Q parameter in dense gas reaches near unity, demonstrating self-regulation via turbulent feedback. We also test how the star formation rate Sigma_SFR depends on Sigma, rho_*, and Omega. Under {{the assumption that the}} star formation rate is proportional to the mass at densities above n_th divided by the free-fall time at that threshold, we find that Sigma_SFR varies as Sigma^(1 +p) with 1 +p ~ 1. 2 - 1. 4 when n_th= 10 ^ 2 or 10 ^ 3 cm^- 3, consistent with observations. Estimated star formation rates based on large-scale properties (the orbital time, the Jeans time, or the free-fall time at the vertically-averaged density) however depart from rates computed using the dense gas mass, indicating that resolving the ISM structure in galactic disks at scales <<H is necessary for accurate predictions of the star formation rate.
