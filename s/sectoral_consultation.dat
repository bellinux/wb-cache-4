40|$|The {{relationship}} between workers and employers in South Africa {{is governed by}} various labour statutes such as the Basic Conditions of Employment Act (BCEA). The Basic Conditions of Employment Act regulates the working conditions of employees, including working hours, leave, particulars of employment and remuneration and termination of employment, etc. The purpose {{is to ensure that}} employees are not exploited and {{that they do not have}} to negotiate for these basic conditions of service. The BCEA does not prescribe the minimum remuneration that an employer must pay an employee, so the BCEA empowers the Minister of Labour to make sectoral determinations for sectors or areas of the economy that are typically in a weak bargaining position or not well organised by trade unions. Sectoral determinations are a means to protect vulnerable employees by fixing conditions of employment as well as minimum wages of employees that would otherwise have to be secured through collective bargaining. Employers and employees as well as their representatives are fully consulted during the process of making <b>sectoral</b> determinations. These <b>consultations</b> are held occasionally and the employers and employees can participate in the making of a sectoral determination that will regulate their employment relationship, either by making written submissions to the Department of Labour or by giving input at the public hearings that are usually held by the Department. The Minister is also advised in this regard by a body called Employment Conditions Commission (ECC), which is an independent statutory body established in terms of section 59 (1) of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act. The Minister of Labour, after consultation with NEDLAC appoints the commissioners. The ECC’s mandate is a broad one, with its primary function being to advise the Minister of Labour on various matters concerning the BCEA. These include among others, the making of sectoral determinations, monitoring trends in collective bargaining for their possible impact on the BCEA. The issues highlighted above will be dealt with in detail in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Independent {{regulatory}} authorities (IRAs) today have considerable competences. They can regulate and supervise the behaviour of market and societal parties, and set prices for goods and services. They can enforce regulations through fines and ‘naming and shaming’. Thirdly, they have quasi-judicial functions. Yet IRAs are independent in their decisions {{from both the}} elected political sphere and sectoral interests. This makes the question whom, or what, these authorities represent a salient one. Yet this question is not often discussed in the literature. In the literature on IRAs, three approaches towards the independent bodies can be distinguished, that either stress their ‘inherent’ legitimacy based {{on the quality of}} their decisions, emphasize their ‘derived’ democratic legitimacy from elected institutions, or argue their legitimacy derives from their relations with a variety of actors. Commonly, however, IRAs are considered ‘unrepresentative’ because of their unelected status. In this thesis, it is argued that IRAs should nevertheless be considered non-electoral representative claimants. Viewing IRAs as such yields positive and normative benefits, that may be employed in the further study of these agencies, including in the three outlined approaches. To make this argument, four IRAs in the Netherlands – the telecommunications regulator OPTA, energy regulator NMa Energy Chamber, financial supervisor AFM, and healthcare regulator NZa – are studied {{from the perspective of the}} theorization of representative claims by Michael Saward (2010). Representation in this framework is considered a rhetorical and discursive process, consisting of claims to act or speak for others and the simultaneous construction of constituencies in these claims. Representative claims may have electoral and non-electoral resources: they can be made by politicians, interest groups, government organizations, ombudsmen and individuals alike. Likewise, representative claims can be received and accepted or rejected by the targeted constituency on the basis of a variety of criteria. Judgments regarding the democratic legitimacy of representative claims should be relayed to this constituency. Employing the representative claim approach, it is argued that the four IRAs in the Netherlands have been claimed by the Dutch law-making body to independently represent economic and non-economic ‘public’ interests in marketized and liberalized domains. Likewise, the four IRAs themselves in their public self-presentation increasingly claim to represent consumer interests in their activities. On the board level, governors are claimed to be independent experts standing for public and consumer interests, although an exploration of the professional backgrounds of board members reveals they often have backgrounds in the bureaucracy or the regulated sector, and never in the consumer movement. Lastly, on the work-floor level, employees of IRAs interact with representatives of <b>sectoral</b> interests in <b>consultation</b> procedures, in which various representative claim-making strategies are employed. Far from unrepresentative, IRAs should therefore be considered representative claimants – and facilitators of representative claims – in their own right. Independent market regulation involves the construction and reception of representative claims just as much as the traditional electoral sphere. Further study of IRAs and their interaction with sectoral interests should take the representative claim-making character of these independent bodies into account. Lastly, in order to strengthen their democratic legitimacy, IRAs should make their decisions transparent to the consumer public, while consumer organizations should be empowered to represent their constituency inside IRA consultation procedures...|$|R
40|$|Executive Summary: Sustaining healthy {{coral reefs}} {{is vital to}} the {{livelihoods}} {{of the people of the}} Pacific Islands. Global change is having increasing impacts on Pacific coral reefs, leading to increased vulnerability of coastal communities (Reefs at Risk Revisited, 2011. World Resources Institute). Integrating global change into policies across various national government sectors and then, translating this into actions that lead to sustainable management of coastal ecosystems is an enormous challenge. The project sought to address this through face-toface dialogue between reef experts and government personnel responsible for coral reef management policies. It aimed to strengthen science-policy interaction and linkages and empower policy-makers to make informed decisions. The project targeted four countries all heavily dependent on their coral reefs: Fiji, Samoa, Tonga and Tuvalu. Using the most recent information available on the sustainable management of coral reefs, the project brought Pacific Leaders together with scientists and experts so that they could be apprised of the impacts of global change and of those factors that are affecting the health of their coral reefs. For each country a detailed national dossier was prepared by the project team in consultation with the countries, leading into two-day workshops. The dossier included a series of issues (including gaps) pertinent to each country which were used in the development of national coral reef plans. About a year later, countries were revisited to review and measure the progress achieved on recommendations on fisheries, marine managed areas, global change and multi <b>sectoral,</b> multi stakeholder <b>consultations.</b> Workshops were held between June and August 2010, in which a total of some 130 senior officials from Fiji, Samoa, Tuvalu and Tonga attended. The workshops identified priority actions for coral reef management. It was found that all four countries had in place, or are developing, appropriate policies for the sustainable management of their coral reefs, taking into account the anticipated impacts of global change. All lacked, however, an overarching policy and the necessary human resources and expertise required for implementation. This situation highlights the dilemma faced by the small Pacific countries responsible for the custodianship of the unique biodiversity of their reefs. In follow-up discussions two countries (Samoa and Tuvalu), requested our assistance in the development of their National Ocean Policies, which would provide the necessary over arching policy and national commitment to sustainable coral reef management. The Institute of Marine Resources has the necessary expertise to do this, but would require the necessary funding. About eight months later, the team visited each country and had consultations with key stakeholders on the progress from the recommendations made during the June-August 2010 workshops. In addition, information was gathered through a literature review. Although progress varied in the four countries, it was evident that collaboration between relevant government departments needed to be improved and that there was a need for the establishment and implementation of management systems that will be on-going and self financing given the resources available. The project provided a model for interaction between scientists and policy makers that could be readily extended to other Pacific Island countries or, for that matter, to other island states where the sustainable management of coral reefs is of vital importance for the 2 conservation of valuable reef resources, and for maintaining the livelihoods of people. Limitations of the project were determined by the smallness of the countries and the consequent lack of human resources to implement policies...|$|R
