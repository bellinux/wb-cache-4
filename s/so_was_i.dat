500|$|When Gray {{originally}} {{tested for}} Dallas, {{the role of}} Sue Ellen was merely that of a background character. The actress recounts that the part was a [...] "mere walk-on" [...] and there hadn't been any need for a formal audition. In fact, Gray had to do an impromptu audition over the telephone because the role was not considered important enough to bring in another actor to test for the part, though the actress later stated that Newhart innkeeper Mary Frann was also considered to play the character while the producers were casting the show. In an interview with TV Guide, Gray confirmed: [...] "She [...] had the part. Victoria Principal was a brunette, and <b>so</b> <b>was</b> <b>I,</b> and Mary was a blonde, and [...] wanted that [...] contrast. But the casting director [...] kept bugging them until they finally said, 'OK, we'll read her.'" [...] Once the show was picked up for a full season, Gray and fellow actor Steve Kanaly (Ray Krebbs) were both upgraded to starring roles.|$|E
2500|$|WWE Hall of Famer Bret [...] "The Hitman" [...] Hart, {{who was a}} multi-time world {{champion}} in both WWE and WCW, enjoyed The Wrestler and applauded Rourke's [...] "clairvoyant" [...] performance, but called the film a [...] "dark misinterpretation" [...] of the business. He asserted: [...] "Randy [...] "The Ram" [...] Robinson was a main-eventer who sold out Madison Square Garden. <b>So</b> <b>was</b> <b>I...</b> Although the film speaks superbly to the speed bumps all pro wrestlers navigate, I’m happy to report most of us don’t swerve off the road quite so severely." [...] WWE play-by-play commentator Jim Ross called it a [...] "really strong, dramatic film that depicts how people who are obsessed with {{their own lives and}} their careers can self-destruct".|$|E
3000|$|Luther’s {{writings}} on translation offer eloquent testimony for his views. Under attack by Catholic theologians for his translation of Romans 3 : 28, {{a passage in}} which he interpolated the word “alleine” (alone) even though the Greek does not contain it, he typically did not debate his rivals on the merits, but turned the debate into a question of authority. He says: “If your papist makes much useless fuss about the word sola, allein, tell him at once: Doctor Martin Luther will have it so, and says: Papist and donkey are the same thing; sic volo, sic jubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas. For {{we do not want}} to be pupils and followers of the Papists, but their masters and judges; for once, we also want to show off and spar with the donkey heads; and as Paul boasts before his mad saints, so I will boast before these donkeys. They <b>are</b> doctors? <b>So</b> <b>am</b> <b>I.</b> They <b>are</b> learned? <b>So</b> <b>am</b> <b>I.</b> They <b>are</b> preachers? <b>So</b> <b>am</b> <b>I.</b> They <b>are</b> theologians? <b>So</b> <b>am</b> <b>I.</b> They <b>are</b> disputators? <b>So</b> <b>am</b> <b>I.</b> They <b>are</b> philosophers? <b>So</b> <b>am</b> <b>I.</b> They <b>are</b> <b>are</b> dialecticians? <b>So</b> <b>am</b> <b>I.</b> They <b>are</b> lecturers? <b>So</b> <b>am</b> <b>I.</b> They write books? So do I. And I shall further boast: I can expound Psalms and Prophets; which they cannot. I can translate; which they cannot. If these donkeys demand further responses to their useless blubbering over sola, then say only so much: Luther wishes it <b>be</b> <b>so</b> and says, he is a doctor above all doctors in all of the papacy. Therefore the word allein shall remain in my New Testament, and though all pope-donkeys [Papstesel] should get furious and foolish, they shall not turn it out.” [...]...|$|R
