25|$|Karzai is {{believed}} to be from the Shamizai subtribe of the Popalzais. His grandfather, Khair Muhammad Karzai, was a head of the Popalzai tribe from Kandahar who relocated to Kabul and ran the business of a guest house. This allowed Karzai's father Abdul Ahad, to gain a foothold in the royal family, and subsequently, the parliament. These actions and upwards movement within the Popalzai tribal system, led to the Karzai family furnishing a viable Shamizai clan alternative to Sadozai leadership {{in the aftermath of the}} Soviet invasion when the Sadozai clan failed to provide a tribal leader. He is often seen wearing a Karakul hat, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> worn by many Afghan kings in the past.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to make the game look more realistic, many of the real players in the game had their entire body scanned into the game, as opposed to just the face like in {{previous}} NBA 2K games. A first for the NBA 2K series, the full body scanning allows the entire body of a specific player to be uniquely different from any other body. In previous NBA 2K games, a player's face was unique, while the body was generic and predefined. The full body scanning improves details in players' tattoos as well, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> criticized in past NBA 2K games. Cheerleaders, coaches, and fans were also scanned into the game; the designs of cheerleaders, coaches, and the crowd have too been criticized in past games.|$|E

25|$|Another {{theory of}} {{creative}} {{people is the}} investment theory of creativity. This approach {{suggest that there are}} many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the investment sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea {{to the point that it}} is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This investment theory of creativity views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.|$|E
500|$|Back in Ainola, Sibelius busied {{himself by}} making new {{arrangements}} of old songs. However, his mind returned frequently to the now apparently moribund symphony.

The significance of a future [...] "galactic alignment" [...] was noted in 1991 by astrologer Raymond Mardyks, who asserted that the winter solstice would align with the galactic plane in 1998/1999. He wrote that this event [...] "only occurs once each 26,000-year cycle and would be most definitely of utmost significance to the top flight ancient astrologers." [...] Astrologer Bruce Scofield noted, [...] "The Milky Way crossing of the winter solstice is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> neglected by Western astrologers, with a few exceptions. Charles Jayne made a very early reference to it, and in the 1970s Rob Hand mentioned it in his talks on precession but didn't elaborate on it.

Writing for BBC Mundo Cristina PÃ©rez felt that [...] "the idea of the [...] vastly developed ego finds strong evidence in lunfardo dictionaries," [...] in words such as [...] "engrupido" [...] (meaning [...] "vain" [...] or [...] "conceited") and [...] "compadrito" [...] (meaning both [...] "brave" [...] and [...] "braggart"), the latter being an archetypal figure of tango. Paradoxically, porteÃ±os are also described as highly self-critical, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> called [...] "the {{other side of the}} ego coin."
