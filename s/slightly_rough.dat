AllGame described the NES {{version of the}} game as a [...] "near-perfect blend of action, challenge and audio-visual excellence" [...] and awarded it five stars, their highest rating. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN described the game as an [...] "undeniable classic" [...] for the NES, noting its graphics, innovative weapon-based platform gameplay, and music. IGN editor Matt Casamassina proclaimed, [...] "Mega Man {{is one of the}} best examples of great graphics, amazing music and near-perfect gameplay rolled into one cartridge". GameSpot writers Christian Nutt and Justin Speer identified the game as a [...] "winner in gameplay" [...] granted its [...] "low-key presentation". Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com likewise outlined it as a [...] "charming (if <b>slightly</b> <b>rough)</b> start for the series". Whether positive or negative, Mega Man has been commonly received as very difficult. IGN's Casamassina found the game the hardest in the franchise, and among the hardest titles on the NES. IGN's Thomas observed that its combination of high difficulty and short length hurt its replayability. According to 1UP.com, the [...] "Nintendo-hard" [...] Mega Man bosses set the game apart from its two immediate and more popular sequels.

[...] Theron Martin of Anime News Network said [...] "Background art varies a little more, from <b>slightly</b> <b>rough</b> to stunningly gorgeous, with some CG-crafted shots of Versailles rivaling even the exquisite detail of Gonzo's best work. Though the series does use some still scenes, neither they nor any other short cuts {{can be found in the}} well-choreographed sword fights, where the attention to detail (especially in rare anime shots of critical footwork) and shifting perspectives more than makes up for slight failings elsewhere." [...] Chris Beveridge of Mania.com said that the [...] "detail and apparent accuracy in many scenes is just great to look at".{ Similarly, Brett D. Rogers of Frames Per Second magazine praised the design and animation, saying that they are [...] "beautifully rendered in rococo and gothic style to create the look and feel of 18th-century France", though also stating that the [...] "CGI is used to good result in reproducing the vast, opulent spaces of Versailles, but the transitions between these effects and the main body of animation are a bit coarse." [...] The series' storyline earned mixed reactions from critics. Robinson complained that most of the series' storyline [...] "falls flat", saying that it was [...] "delivered too rapidly and with little affect". She also compared Le Chevalier D'Eon to GONZO's Gankutsuou, describing both series as [...] "heavily talky yet fast-moving enough to be confusing."

60|$|The spur of {{the officer}} caught in a tree-root, he went down {{backwards}} with a crash, {{the middle of his}} back thudding sickeningly against a sharp-edged tree-base, the pot flying away. And in a second the orderly, with serious, earnest young face, and under-lip between his teeth, had got his knee in the officer's chest and was pressing the chin backward over the farther edge of the tree-stump, pressing, with all his heart behind in a passion of relief, the tension of his wrists exquisite with relief. And with the base of his palms he shoved at the chin, with all his might. And it was pleasant, too, to have that chin, that hard jaw already <b>slightly</b> <b>rough</b> with beard, in his hands. He did not relax one hair's breadth, but, all the force of all his blood exulting in his thrust, he shoved back the head of the other man, till there was a little cluck and a crunching sensation. Then he felt as if his head went to vapour. Heavy convulsions shook the body of the officer, frightening and horrifying the young soldier. Yet it pleased him, too, to repress them. It pleased him to keep his hands pressing back the chin, to feel the chest of the other man yield in expiration to the weight of his strong, young knees, to feel the hard twitchings of the prostrate body jerking his own whole frame, which was pressed down on it.|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as we}} were seated, an {{earthenware}} jar {{was passed}} round containing a fermented fluid, of by no means unpleasant taste, though apt to turn upon the stomach, made from crushed grain--not Indian corn, but a small brown grain that grows upon its stem in clusters, not unlike that which {{in the southern part}} of Africa is known by the name of Kafir corn. The vase which contained this liquor was very curious, and as it more or less resembled many hundreds of others in use among the Amahagger I may as well describe it. These vases are of a very ancient manufacture, and of all sizes. None such can have been made in the country for hundreds, or rather thousands, of years. They are found in the rock tombs, of which I shall give a description in their proper place, and my own belief is that, after the fashion of the Egyptians, with whom the former inhabitants of this country may have had some connection, they were used to receive the viscera of the dead. Leo, however, is of opinion that, as in the case of Etruscan amphoræ, they were placed there for the spiritual use of the deceased. They are mostly two-handled, and of all sizes, some being nearly three feet in height, and running from that down to as many inches. In shape they vary, but all are exceedingly beautiful and graceful, being made of a very fine black ware, not lustrous, but <b>slightly</b> <b>rough.</b> On this groundwork are inlaid figures much more graceful and lifelike than any others that I have seen on antique vases. Some of these inlaid pictures represent love-scenes with a childlike simplicity and freedom of manner which would not commend itself to the taste of the present day. Others again give pictures of maidens dancing, and yet others of hunting-scenes. For instance, the very vase from which we were then drinking had on one side a most spirited drawing of men, apparently white in colour, attacking a bull-elephant with spears, while on the reverse was a picture, not quite so well done, of a hunter shooting an arrow at a running antelope, I should say from the look of it either an eland or a koodoo.|$|E
50|$|Fingering {{the vagina}} is often {{performed}} {{in an effort}} to stimulate the G-spot.

It is described as being recognized by its ridges and <b>slightly</b> <b>rougher</b> texture compared to the more cushion-like vaginal cavity walls around it. Fingering this spot, and in effect possibly stimulating the Skene's gland, is commonly cited as a method that may lead to female ejaculation. Parallels are sometimes drawn with the fingering or other manipulation of the male prostate through the anus.|$|R

60|$|We were not, to all appearance, {{appointed}} by fate {{for the most}} perceptive and penetrative offices conceivable; so that to have over against us and within range a proposition, as we nowadays say, that could only grow more and more vivid, more and more engaging and inspiring, in the measure of our growth of criticism and curiosity, or, in other words, of the capacity just to pay attention, pay attention otherwise than by either sticking very fast at home or inquiring of the Antipodes, the Antipodes almost exclusively--what has that practically been for us {{but one of the}} very choicest phases of our luck aforesaid, one of the most appraisable of our felicities? the very one, doubtless, that our dissimilarity of temperament and taste would have most contradictiously and most correctively prescribed from the moment we were not to be left simply to stew in our juice! If the advantage I so characterise was to be in its own way thoroughly affirmative, there was yet nothing about it to do real or injurious violence to that abysmal good nature which sometimes strikes me as our most effective contribution to human history. The vision of France, at any rate, so close and so clear at propitious hours, was to grow happily illustrational for us as nothing else in any like relation to us could possibly have become. Other families have a way, on good opportunity, of interesting us more than our own, and here was this immense acquaintance extraordinarily mattering for us {{and at the same time}} not irritating us by a single claim of cousinship or a single liberty taken on any such score. Any liberties taken were much rather liberties, I think, of ours--always abounding as we did in quite free, and perhaps <b>slightly</b> <b>rough,</b> and on the whole rather superficial, movement beyond our island circle and toward whatever lay in our path. France lay very much in our path, our path to almost everything that could beckon us forth from our base--and there were very few things in the world or places on the globe that didn't so beckon us; according to which she helped us along on our expansive course a good deal more, doubtless, than either she or we always knew.|$|E
