40|$|Most {{eukaryotic}} pre-mRNAs contain non-coding sequences (introns) {{that must}} be removed in order to accurately place the coding sequences (exons) in the correct reading frame. This critical regulatory pre-mRNA splicing event is fundamental in development and cancer. It occurs within a mega-Dalton multicomponent machine composed of RNA and proteins, which undergoes dynamic changes in RNA-RNA, RNA-protein, and protein-protein interactions during the splicing reaction. Recent years have seen progress in functional and structural analyses of the <b>splicing</b> <b>machine</b> and its subcomponents, and this review is focused on structural aspects of the pre-mRNA <b>splicing</b> <b>machine</b> and their mechanistic implications on the splicing of multi-intronic pre-mRNAs. It brings together, in a comparative manner, structural information on spliceosomes and their intermediates in the stepwise assembly process in vitro, and on the preformed supraspliceosomes, which are isolated from living cell nuclei, {{with a view of}} portraying a consistent picture...|$|E

40|$|Quality {{control is}} {{a crucial part of}} any {{manufacturing}} unit, as it assures compliance to established standards as well as maintenance of product quality for internal management purposes. Quality control of spliced veneer in Czech wood based industries is mainly based on ČSN 49   2315 and ČSN 49   2320 standards, which rely on measurement of crack length in finished product. This method has been satisfactorily used since 1985 but requirements of wood based industry has changed a lot in these years. We propose an alternate method for mesurement of tensile strength of spliced veneers. Samples of specified size spliced were taken as mentioned in details and they were subjected to tensile stength measurement. An addtional adhesive tape was used to avoid intra-material fibres disjointing, so that inter-material tensile strength can be measured for spliced veneers. This test can be used for on – site optimization of <b>splicing</b> <b>machine</b> units as well as regular quality control of spliced venners...|$|E
40|$|The pre-mRNA <b>splicing</b> <b>machine</b> must {{frequently}} {{discriminate between}} normal and many potential 5 ′splice sites that match the consensus sequence but remain latent. Suppression of splicing (SOS) at such latent 5 ′splice sites {{is required for}} the maintenance of an open reading frame, and to ensure that only RNAs that encode for functional proteins will be formed. In this study we show that SOS is a novel mechanism distinct from the known RNA surveillance mechanisms. First, SOS is distinct from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) because it is not dependent on translation and is not affected by RNAi-mediated down-regulation of hUpf 1 and hUpf 2 —two key components of the NMD pathway. Second, SOS is distinct from nonsense-associated alternative splicing (NAS), because a mutant of hUpf 1, which was shown to abrogate NAS, does not activate latent splicing. Elucidating the mechanism of SOS is pertinent to human disease in view of the large number of human genes that harbor latent splice sites...|$|E
40|$|The compact micro-ball lens {{structure}} fabricated at the cleaved {{tip of a}} microfiber coupler (MFC) {{is proposed}} and demonstrated for sensing various glucose concentrations in deionized water.

The working mechanism of this device is based on the observed reduction in the peak power of the sensor wavelength spectrum as the concentration of glucose is increased.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{a new approach}} to improve the precision of splice site annotation in human genes. The problem is known to be extremely challenging since the human splice signals are highly indistinct and frequent cryptic sites confuse signal sensors. There is a strong evidence that Exonic Splicing Enhancers (ESE) and Exonic Splicing Silencers (ESS) influence commitment to splicing at early stages. We propose the use of a Naïve Bayesian Network (BN) combined with Boltzmann <b>machine</b> <b>splice</b> sites sensor, to improve the specificity of splice site prediction. The SpliceScan program is implemented to demonstrate feasibility of specificity enhancement based on ESE/ESS signals interactions.

40|$|Pre-mRNA {{splicing}} involves {{recognition of}} a consensus sequence at the 5 ′ splice site (SS). However, {{only some of the}} many potential sites that conform to the consensus are true ones, whereas the majority remain silent and are not normally used for splicing. We noticed that in most cases the utilization of such a latent intronic 5 ′ SS for splicing would introduce an in-frame stop codon into the resultant mRNA. This finding suggested a link between SS selection and maintenance of an ORF within the mRNA. Here we tested this idea by analyzing the splicing of pre-mRNAs in which in-frame stop codons upstream of a latent 5 ′ SS were mutated. We found that splicing with the latent site is indeed activated by such mutations. Our findings predict the existence of a checking mechanism, as a component of the nuclear pre-mRNA <b>splicing</b> <b>machine,</b> to ensure the maintenance of an ORF. This notion is highly important for accurate gene expression, as perturbations that would lead to splicing at these latent sites are expected to introduce in-frame stop codons into the majority of mRNAs...|$|E
40|$|A compact micro-ball lens {{structure}} is fabricated at the cleaved tip of microfiber coupler (MFC) waist for displacement sensor application. The MFC {{is made by}} fusing and tapering two optical fibers using a flame brushing technique. It is then cleaved {{at the center of}} the minimum waist region. Then a micro-ball lens is formed at the tip of the microfiber by an arcing technique using a fusion <b>splicing</b> <b>machine.</b> The proposed displacement sensor uses the micro-ball lens as a probe and a reflector as a target. As the target is moved from the micro-ball lens, an interference fringe is obtained due to the interference between two reflected beams from the micro-ball lens and the reflector. At the smallest displacement of 0. 6 mm, the output spectrum shows the interference fringes with highest extinction ratio and largest free spectral range (FSR). Both extinction ratio and FSR reduces following the power trend line with correlation coefficient of 0. 99 as the displacement increases.

40|$|Background: Decreased high-energy {{phosphate}} {{level is}} involved in endothelial cell injury and dysfunction. Reduced telomerase activity in endothelial cells in parallel with reduced energy levels {{might be due to}} altered direction of alternative <b>splicing</b> <b>machine</b> as a complication of depleted energy during the process of atherosclerosis. Materials and Methods: Isolated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated for 24 hours by oligomycine (OM) and 2 -deoxy glucose (2 -DG). After 24 hours, the effect of energy depletion on telomerase splicing pattern was evaluated using RT-PCR. Indeed, in both treated and untargeted cells, nitric oxide (NO) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) were measured. Results: ATP was depleted in treated cells by 43. 9 % compared with control group. We observed a slight decrease in NO levels (P = 0. 09) and vWF (P = 0. 395) in the setting of 49. 36 % ATP depletion. In both groups, no telomerase gene expression was seen. Telomerase and housekeeping gene expression were found in positive control group (colon cancer tissue) and sample tissue. Conclusions: The absence of telomerase gene expression in HUVECs might be due to the mortality of these cells or the low level of telomerase gene expression in these cells under normal circumstances...|$|E

Editors were very precise; if they made a wrong cut or needed a fresh positive print, it cost them money for the lab to reprint the footage and push the editing process back farther.

PT Gajah tungal Tbk is a large company with a very much number and type of machines or production equipment. With the number reached 2, 569 machines, of course, engine components / spare parts for these machines are very many and need to be replaced periodically to maintain reliability of these machines. Replacement engine components often occurs when the engine failure has occurred. The number of machines in the PT Gajah Tunggal Tbk requires an effective and efficient component maintenance system.

40|$|Pre-mRNA {{splicing}} is {{an important}} regulatory step in the expression of most eukaryotic genes. In vitro studies have shown splicing to occur within 50 - 60 S multi-component ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes termed spliceosomes. Studies of mammalian cell nuclei have revealed larger complexes that sediment at 200 S in sucrose gradients, termed large nuclear RNP (lnRNP) particles. These particles contain all factors required for pre-mRNA splicing, including the spliceosomal U snRNPs and protein splicing factors. Electron microscopy has shown them to consist of four apparently similar substructures. In this study, mass measurements by {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} of freeze-dried mammalian lnRNP preparations, both confirm the similarity between the lnRNP particles and reveal the mass uniformity of their subunits. Thus, the tetrameric lnRNP particle has a mass of 21. 1 (+/- 1. 6) MDa, while each repeating subunit has a mass of 4. 8 (+/- 0. 5) MDa, which is close to the estimated mass of the fully assembled 60 S spliceosome. The 1. 9 MDa discrepancy between the lnRNP particle's mass and the cumulative masses of its four subunits may be attributed to an additional domain frequently observed in the micrographs. Notably, strands and loops of RNA were often seen emanating from lnRNP particles positively stained with uranyl formate. Our results support the idea that the nuclear <b>splicing</b> <b>machine</b> is a supraspliceosome complex. For clarity, we define spliceosomes devoid of pre-mRNA as spliceosome cores, and propose that the supraspliceosome is constructed from one pre-mRNA, four spliceosome cores, each composed mainly of U snRNPs, and additional proteins. In this way a frame is provided to juxtapose exons about to be spliced...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes three {{enhancements}} to the TCP splicing mechanism: (1) Enable {{the same}} TCP connection to be simultaneously <b>spliced</b> through multiple <b>machines</b> for better scalability; (2) Make a spliced connection faulttolerant to proxy failures; and (3) Provide flexibility of splitting the splicing functionality between a proxy and a backend server for further increasing the scalability {{of a web}} server system. A web server architecture based on this enhanced TCP splicing is proposed. This architecture provides a highly scalable, seamless service to the users with minimal disruption during server failures. In addition to the traditional web services in which users download webpages, multimedia files {{and other types of}} data from a web server, the proposed architecture supports newly emerging web services that are highly interactive, and involve relatively longer, stateful client server sessions.

40|$|In many 13 kA <b>splices</b> in the <b>machine</b> {{there is}} a lack of bonding between the superconducting cable and the {{stabilising}} copper along with a bad contact between the bus stabiliser and the splice stabiliser. In case of a quench of such a defective splice, the current cannot bypass the cable through the copper, hence leading to excessive local heating of the cable. This may result in a thermal runaway and burn-through of the cable in a time smaller than the time constant of the circuit. Since it is not possible to protect against this fast thermal run-away, one has to limit the current to a level that is small enough so that a burn-through cannot occur. Prompt quenching of the joint, and quenching due to heat propagation through the bus and through the helium are considered. Probabilities for joint burn-through are given for the RB circuit for beam energies of 3. 5, 4 and 4. 5 TeV, and a decay time constant of the RB circuit of 50 and 68 s...|$|R
40|$|TCP {{splicing}} {{has been}} commonly used {{for increasing the}} performance of serving web content through proxies. Web server architectures built using TCP splicing suffer from two limitations: (1) All traffic between clients and servers typically passes through the proxy, thus making the proxy scalability and performance bottlenecks; and (2) This architecture cannot tolerate proxy failures. This paper uses simulation to evaluate the design of three different server architectures that address these limitations. These architectures are based on three enhancements to the TCP splicing mechanism [7]: (1) Replicating a TCP splice at multiple proxies; (2) Making TCP splice fault tolerant; and (3) Splitting a single TCP splice functionality into two unidirectional splices with segments in the two directions being <b>spliced</b> at different <b>machines.</b> The three architectures are suitable for different types of web service applications, and provide a flexibility of merging the proxy and back-end server functionalities on {{the same set of}} machines, not changing the OS of the back-end servers at all, or a mixed configuration in which the OS of only some back-end servers is modified. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{usage of}} genetic {{information}} by the cellular machinery {{has been greatly}} facilitated by the evolution of splicing, a process that permits to join fragments of coding sequences (exons) from larger genomic regions containing prevalently non-coding sequences (introns). The process relies on the precision of exon recognition since a single nucleotide shift leads to an alteration of the reading frame and hence to altered information. The analysis of the splice sites {{has led to the}} identification of the consensus sequences GURAGU at the exon-intron border and AXnYnAG (branch point, polypyrimidine tract, AG) for the intron-exon border. However, these consensi are weak: many real sequences considerably divert from them, and a great number of sequences matching the consensus patterns are not used as splice sites. We follow the hypothesis that additional sequence features that contribute to the splice site definition can be identified if specific classes of such sites are considered. Yet there is no objective criterion to classify exons. We therefore set out to classify <b>splice</b> sites using <b>machine</b> learning approaches. The classification of splice sites can be used for analyses of correlation with the biological behavior of the relative exons such as alternative splicing.

These concepts may involve, and evolve toward: consultation from remote expert teaching centers; diagnosis; triage; real-time remote advice to the surgeon; and real-time remote surgical instrument manipulation (telerobotics with virtual reality). Further extrapolation leads to teledesign and telereplication of spare surgical parts through quantitative teleimaging of 3 -D surfaces tied to CAD/CAM devices and an artificially intelligent archival data base of 'normal' shapes. The ability to generate 'topogrames' or 3 -D surface numerical tables of coordinate values capable of creating computer-generated virtual holographic-like displays, machine part replication, and statistical diagnostic shape assessment is critical to the progression of telemedicine. Any virtual reality simulation will remain in 'video-game' realm until realistic dimensional and spatial relational inputs from real measurements in vivo during surgeries are added to an ever-growing statistical data archive. The challenges of managing and interpreting this 3 -D data base, which would include radiographic and surface quantitative data, are considerable. As technology drives toward dynamic and continuous 3 -D surface measurements, presenting millions of X, Y, Z data points per second of flexing, stretching, moving human organs, the knowledge base and interpretive capabilities of 'brilliant robots' to work as a surgeon's tireless assistants becomes imaginable. The brilliant robot would 'see' what the surgeon sees [...] and more, for the robot could quantify its 3 -D sensing and would 'see' in a wider spectral range than humans, and could zoom its 'eyes' from the macro world to long-distance microscopy.
