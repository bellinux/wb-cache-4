25|$|The {{ability to}} learn rules is {{dependent}} on nonsynaptic plasticity. One <b>study</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> teach rats to discriminate between various odors, and it took several days {{to teach them to}} distinguish between a first pair of smells. However, after learning this, the rat was able to learn to distinguish between different odors much faster. Changes in excitability of the pyramidal neurons in these rats were observed for three days after training. These changes faded eventually, suggesting that the neurons were involved in learning the rules, not in storing memory. Daoudal and Debanne attempted to determine if the same learning rules and induction mechanisms defined for synaptic plasticity also applied to nonsynaptic plasticity affecting ion channels. They determined that nonsynaptic and synaptic plasticity share common learning rules and induction pathways, e.g., NMDA receptor dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). They also showed that nonsynaptic and synaptic plasticity synergistically form a coherent engram to store memory traces.|$|E

2500|$|While it {{is known}} that {{congenital}} amusia is a disorder characterized by poor pitch perception, a recent <b>study</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> discover to what extent this pitch deficit may compromise singing. In this study, eleven amusic individuals and eleven controls were asked to sing a familiar song using the lyrics first, and then using the syllable [...] "la". Results showed that individuals with congenital amusia were poor singers. They could not maintain a stable pitch, nor could they sing the correct pitch intervals that were written in the music. However, many of the amusic testing subjects were able to sing with the correct rhythm. The results confirmed that the amusics' ability to detect pitch changes influences their level of singing proficiency. The subjects who struggled the most with pitch perception were the most unstable in producing the correct pitch and made several pitch interval and contour errors. However, there were some remarkable exceptions. A couple of amusic individuals were able to sing proficiently despite extremely impaired pitch perception.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>study</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} whether early exposure to BPA could accelerate mammary carcinogenesis in a dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) model of rodent mammary cancer. In the study, scientists exposed neonatal/prebubertal rats to BPA via lactation from nursing dams treated orally with 0, 25, and 250µg BPA/kg body weight/day. [...] For tumorigenesis studies, female offspring {{were exposed to}} 30mg DMBA/kg body weight at 50 days of age. [...] DMBA induces mammary tumors and allows chemicals that predispose for mammary cancer {{to increase the number}} of mammary adenocarcinomas. [...] The results of the study showed that female rats in the control, BPA 25, and BPA 250 groups administered DMBA exhibited a BPA dose-dependent increase in mammary tumors. [...] The groups had 2.84, 3.82, and 5.00 mammary tumors per rat respectively. [...] Treatment with BPA also reduced tumor latency, with the median tumor latency of 65, 53, and 56.5 days for 0, BPA 25, and BPA 250 groups respectively. [...] Maternal exposure to BPA during lactation decreased time to first tumor latency and increased the number of DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female offspring. [...] If these effects found in rodents carry over to humans, even minimal exposure to BPA could cause an increased risk for breast cancer.|$|E
