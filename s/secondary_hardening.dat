40|$|ABSTRACT. Biaxial {{experiments}} with cruciform specimens {{can be used}} to determine the influence of the biaxial stress states on the material behavior, but are rare in literature. In the present study the cyclic deformation and fatigue behavior of a austenitic CrMnNi TRIP steel was investigated under biaxial out-of-phase and biaxial in-phase loading with different phase angles Φ as well as uniaxial loading. The biaxial experiments were performed by using a servohydraulic tension-compression test rig and cruciform specimens. The results show similar fatigue lives under out-of-phase loading in comparison to in-phase loading with Φ = 0 ° and much higher fatigue lives under 180 ° in-phase loading than under all other stress states. The reason was not given by the martensitic phase transformation of the steel which causes <b>secondary</b> <b>hardening</b> during cyclic deformation. No significant dependence of the fatigue life on the martensite formation and the <b>secondary</b> <b>hardening</b> were found. Moreover, it seems that there is no linear correlation between the phase angle Φ and the martensite formation as well as the <b>secondary</b> <b>hardening.</b> As possible explanations for the fatigue lives under biaxial in-phase and out-of-phase loading the microcrack propagation directions and the hydrostatic stress component were discussed...|$|E

Hydrogen related problems in the weld fabrication stage or hydrogen induced stress cracking (HISC) due to hydrogen embrittlement under cathodic protection have been reported and testing to better understand the behavior of these materials is of interest. The present work is focusing on the effect of double heat cycles on carbide precipitation and <b>secondary</b> <b>hardening</b> in two high grade SMSS, one alloyed with Ti and one not (0. 007 % Ti). The experimental work included heat treatment of both steels in single and double cycles in both oven and in induction heating weld simulator. All specimens were heated to 1000 degrees celsius for 30 min to austenize the material and air cooled before simulating second heat cycles of 1 - 60 min in the temperature range 500 - 600 degrees celsius. The microstructures resulting from the heat treatments were characterized by standard metallographic techniques, hardness testing and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results from hardness testing show a <b>secondary</b> <b>hardening</b> effect in both steels for all temperatures tested, with a maximum for samples treated at 550 degrees celsius. For all samples there was also a significant drop in hardness from the hardness of the single cycle sample to the 1 min tempered double cycle samples.

40|$|The {{influence}} of Laves {{phase in the}} microstructure on the creep strength of a modified 9 Cr- 1 Mo tempered ferritic steel, F 91, is investigated in this research. Through additional aging heat treatment up to 5000 h, a pronounced increase of Mo-rich Laves phase is found around Cr-rich carbide M 23 C 6, which is pinned on the prior-austenite grain boundaries and martensitic lath boundaries. This <b>secondary</b> precipitation <b>hardening</b> provided by the Laves phase is rapidly offset by its coarsening into large clusters during long-term thermal exposure and under creep conditions, leading to earlier creep rupture than the pristine material. Uniaxial constant-load creep tests are conducted on both aged and non-aged coupons under the same creep conditions. The creep rupture behavior of both materials is rationalized {{with the assistance of}} a deformation-mechanism-based true-stress creep model that was developed in the previous work.

The overall {{aim of this}} work has been to investigate the precipitation during <b>secondary</b> <b>hardening</b> of these low-chromium steels using electron microscopy and atom probe. Modelling and experimental evaluation was also done {{in order to see}} if it is possible to add nitrogen to low-chromium steel and still get <b>secondary</b> <b>hardening.</b> The steels was analyzed as-hardened as well as tempered. With no nitrogen added the secondary precipitates were found to be MC and M 2 C with mixed compositions regarding vanadium, molybdenum and chromium. In the as-hardened state there was some auto-tempering, resulting in the precipitation of ε-carbide and M 3 C. When tempering at 625 ºC for 2 + 2 hours the microstructure is peppered with small (< 5 nm) secondary precipitates and after slight overtempering there had been some coarsening. However, there was still large amounts of very small precipitates, which indicates that there had been further precipitation during the overtempering. With the nitrogen addition the modelling suggested that the M(C,N) phase would be difficult to dissolve much during austenitizing, but it also predicted {{that there would be a}} potential for secondary precipitation. The three trial alloys confirmed that the hardening response was lowered as the nitrogen level was increased; and all three alloys had clear <b>secondary</b> <b>hardening</b> during high temperature tempering.

The extent of clip and coil subtraction by automated software was evaluated using CT digital subtraction angiography and CT perfusion. Impact on CT perfusion values by retained intracranial devices was compared to age- and gender-matched controls. ResultsClip and coil subtraction on CT angiography was graded as good in 8 and moderate in 3 cases. A residual neck and additional aneurysm were noted in 1 of 11 patients. Post-procedural axial slice level CT perfusion values decreased in reliability with increasing proximity to the metallic devices <b>secondary</b> to beam <b>hardening.</b> However, the intracranial devices did not affect axial slice level CTP values of cerebral blood volume, cerebral blood flow and mean transit time outside {{of the level of}} the device.

40|$|Hardened {{underground}} {{structures are}} purposely constructed beneath the ground surface for additional protection. The protection and sustainability {{of such a}} structure {{is provided by the}} soil overburden, supported by the structure's roof slab, also called a primary slab. The soil overburden usually contains one or more layers of protective reinforced concrete slabs, defined as <b>secondary</b> slabs. <b>Hardened</b> sub-surface structures can experience a degree of damage from sub-surface explosions, caused by the detonation of airborne weapons at variable depths within the soil overburden layer. The research objective was to evaluate the degree to which material and geometric parameters influenced the magnitude of groundshock loading and hence the severity of damage to sub-surface positioned reinforced concrete slabs. The work was of an experimental nature, performed within a purposely built test cell. The experimental set-up involved positioning cylindrical charges within the soil overburden at variable standoffs from an initially positioned steel plate, then from a primary slab, which was subjected to a series of cumulative loadings. The structural response of both the steel plate and a reinforced concrete slab were evaluated using an energy balance procedure. A parametric study was performed, determining the influence each geometric parameter had to the magnitude of groundshock loading. The variability of data associated with the material parameters was analysed and compared to the published literature. Numerical simulations were performed {{at the end of the}} experimental stage (using the non-linear finite element programme AUTODYN 21)) to investigate phenomena that could not be investigated experimentally. A visual damage assessment in the form of a crack pattern analysis and chronological order of occurring mechanisms upon reinforced concrete slabs was performed. The severity of damage to the primary slabs was then associated with the cumulative load impulse history. The research yielded the following conclusions: I. An idealised half sine-wave load distribution approximated the pressure-time history profiles recorded by pressure gauges. 2. The steel plate and one concrete slab (for which conclusive data was obtained) responded impulsively to groundshock loading. 3. The magnitude of groundshock loading was most sensitive to a change in the charge standoff. 4. The reduction in the soil overburden above the top face of a secondary slab did not influence the groundshock loading induced into a primary slab. 5. The effect of the propagating groundshock wave overrode any initial form of soil compaction between the charge and target. This was due to the significantly high stresses induced into the soil, which were well above the initial insitu stresses. 6. Internal weakening of a primary slab, which was unidentifiable from the external damage, caused significant loss in structural strength and stiffness.

An excellent combination of hardness, strength, and ductility was achieved after only 5 seconds aging at 550 °C.

Four distinct microstructural zones were observed for the as-welded condition in the heat-affected zone. Subsequent PWHT resulted in a reduction of the peak hardness on adjacent sides of the weld with all other areas increasing in hardness. These changes in hardness are explained based on tempering of the martensitic structure and precipitation reactions during PWHT. ...|$|E
40|$|Five {{types of}} temper {{embrittlement}} arose in HAZ of Cr-Mo steel in the temperature range of 775 K to 875 K. The metallurgical factors affecting {{those types of}} embrittlement were discussed from the view point of the precipitation and growth of carbide, {{the size and shape}} of ferrite grains and the segregation of impurity elements. The first and the second types of embrittlement are induced by the <b>secondary</b> <b>hardening</b> brought about by the coherent precipitation of M 2 C. The third type is induced by the segregation of impurity elements in the grain boundary. The fourth type is possibly induced by the coarsening of M 2 C and M 7 C 3. The fifth type is induced mainly by the coarsening of ferrite grains...|$|E
