500|$|The {{show was}} {{designed}} for a revolving stage divided into four sets, with Arjona performing with seven musicians and a showgirl. Fifty people were needed {{to set up the}} 45-ton stage, which was transported on 17 trucks. One hundred fifty lights, (seventy of which were mobile) were used during each concert, in addition to ten tons of scenery. Each set related to the songs being performed. The first evoked a two-floor apartment with books, tables and chairs. Here Arjona sang [...] "Lo Que Está Bien Está Mal", [...] "Animal Nocturno", [...] "Hay Amores", [...] "Desnuda" [...] and [...] "El Amor" [...] (during the <b>set</b> <b>change).</b> The second set represented a bar, where the singer performed [...] "Historia de Taxi" [...] and [...] "Como Duele". He then interacted with the audience on [...] "Pingüinos en La Cama"; during some concerts Arjona sang to a fan's phone, and invited an older woman onstage to accompany him on [...] "Señora De Las Cuatro Décadas".|$|E
2500|$|In April 2010, {{the anchor}} {{desk in the}} studio was {{relocated}} back {{in front of the}} window overlooking Times Square, where it had been when Good Morning America moved to the Times Square Studios facility in 1999; the news desk was also moved in front of a window. On May 3, 2010, the program debuted new [...] "light blue and sunny" [...] graphics, and new theme music by DreamArtists Studios. An entirely new set for the program was introduced on January 31, 2011; the monitor used for national weather segments (used mainly during the 7:00a.m. hour only) was moved closer to the anchor desk while the news desk remained in the same place. This was the first major <b>set</b> <b>change</b> since the show upgraded to high definition in November 2005.|$|E
2500|$|The channel was criticised at launch for its {{style of}} presentation, with accusations {{of it being}} less {{authoritative}} than the BBC One news bulletins, with presenters appearing on-screen without jackets. Jenny Abramsky had originally planned to have a television version of the informal news radio channel BBC Radio 5 Live, or a TV version of Radio 4 News FM both of which she had run. The bright design of the set was also blamed for this – one insider reportedly {{described it as a}} [...] "car crash in a shower" [...] – and was subject to the network relaunch on 25 October 1999. The channel swapped studios with sister channel BBC World, moving to studio N8 within the newsroom, where it remained until 2008. New music and title sequences accompanied this <b>set</b> <b>change,</b> following the look of newly relaunched BBC One bulletins.|$|E

2500|$|The Beatles {{appeared}} on three consecutive Sundays in February 1964 to great anticipation and fanfare as [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] had swiftly risen to No. 1 in the charts. Their first appearance on February 9 {{is considered a}} milestone in American pop culture {{and the beginning of}} the British Invasion in music. The broadcast drew an estimated 73 million viewers, at the time a record for US television. The Beatles followed Ed's show opening intro, performing [...] "All My Loving"; [...] "Till There Was You", which featured the names of the group members superimposed on closeup shots, including the famous [...] "SORRY GIRLS, HE'S MARRIED" [...] caption on John Lennon; and [...] "She Loves You". The act that followed Beatles in the broadcast, magician Fred Kaps, was pre-recorded in order to allow time for an elaborate <b>set</b> <b>change.</b> The group returned later in the program to perform [...] "I Saw Her Standing There" [...] and [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand".|$|E
2500|$|Even {{with this}} {{truncated}} {{version of the}} opera, many compromises and cuts were made, some during rehearsals, and some during the run. The new second act was the Chasse [...] Royale et Orage ("Royal Hunt and Storm") , an elaborate pantomime ballet with nymphs, sylvans, and fauns and a chorus. Since the <b>set</b> <b>change</b> for this scene took nearly an hour, it was cut, despite the fact its staging had been greatly simplified with a painted waterfall, rather than one with real water. Carvalho had originally planned to divert water from the nearby Seine, but during the rehearsals, a faulty switch nearly caused a disaster. The entries of the builders, sailors, and farm-workers , were omitted because Carvalho found them dull; likewise, the scene for Anna and Narbal [...] and the second ballet [...] The sentries duet [...] was omitted, because Carvalho had found its [...] "homely style... {{out of place in}} an epic work". Iopas's stanzas [...] disappeared with Berlioz's approval, the singer De Quercy [...] "charged with the part being incapable of singing them well." [...] The duet between Dido and Aeneas [...] was cut because, as Berlioz himself realized, [...] "Madame Charton's voice was unequal to the vehemence of this scene, which took so much out of her that she would not have had the strength left to deliver the tremendous recitative 'Dieux immortels! il part!' , the final aria , and the scene on the pyre [...]" [...] The [...] "Song of Hylas" [...] , which was [...] "greatly liked at the early performances and was well sung", was cut while Berlioz was at home sick with bronchitis. The singer of the part, Edmond Cabel, was also performing in a revival of Félicien David's La perle du Brésil, and since his contract only required him to sing fifteen times per month, {{he would have to be}} paid an extra two hundred francs for each additional performance. Berlioz lamented: [...] "If I am able to put on an adequate performance of a work of this scale and character I must be in absolute control of the theatre, as I am of the orchestra when I rehearse a symphony." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{did that}} dreadful Mask {{first look at}} me? Who put it on, and why was I so frightened that {{the sight of it}} is an era in my life? It is not a hideous visage in itself; it is even meant to be droll, why then were its stolid {{features}} so intolerable? Surely not because it hid the wearer's face. An apron would have done as much; and though I should have preferred even the apron away, {{it would not have been}} absolutely insupportable, like the mask. Was it the immovability of the mask? The doll's face was immovable, but I was not afraid of HER. Perhaps that fixed and <b>set</b> <b>change</b> coming over a real face, infused into my quickened heart some remote suggestion and dread of the universal change that is to come on every face, and make it still? Nothing reconciled me to it. No drummers, from whom proceeded a melancholy chirping on the turning of a handle; no regiment of soldiers, with a mute band, taken out of a box, and fitted, one by one, upon a stiff and lazy little set of lazy-tongs; no old woman, made of wires and a brown-paper composition, cutting up a pie for two small children; could give me a permanent comfort, for a long time. Nor was it any satisfaction to be shown the Mask, and see that it was made of paper, or to have it locked up and be assured that no one wore it. The mere recollection of that fixed face, the mere knowledge of its existence anywhere, was sufficient to awake me in the night all perspiration and horror, with, [...] "O I know it's coming! O the mask!" ...|$|E

When seated on the stage, the audience member is able to view the actors in person, or via the many TV monitors. There is no intermission, but there are several 5-minute <b>set</b> <b>changes.</b> Also on stage is a bar selling food and drink, and an Internet station, which audience members can use during the <b>set</b> <b>changes.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to Private Fears in Public Places and its 54 mini-scenes, Improbable Fiction used the single {{set of the}} living room in Arnold's house throughout the play, and one continuous scene, broken only by the interval. The first act almost entirely takes place during the Writers' Circle meeting. In the second act, however, the same room represents various houses in various stories in Victorian times, the 1930s, and the present day, with no <b>set</b> <b>change</b> other than changing the type of phone present on the dresser.|$|E

50|$|The term {{degree is}} used in several scales of temperature. The symbol ° is usually used, {{followed}} by the initial letter of the unit, for example “°C” for degree(s) Celsius.
