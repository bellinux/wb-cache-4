40|$|The {{morphology}} of {{isotactic polypropylene}} is investigated using scanning electron microscopy. The structure is modified {{by the addition}} of specific nucleating agent, special processing conditions or blending with polyethylene. The addition of β-nucleating agent into polypropylene induces the crystallization into fine β-spherulitic structure on the contrary to relatively large α-spherulites observed in neat polypropylene. Extrusion of polypropylene with special extrusion line equipped by semi-hyperbolic extrusion die causes the formation of fibrillar structure. Such a <b>self-reinforced</b> <b>material</b> possesses significantly improved strength and modulus. The extrusion of polypropylene/polyethylene blend using the same extrusion line leads to the creation of microfibrillar-reinforced material where the polypropylene serves as a stiffening rod and polyethylene as a matrix...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Mechanical {{properties}} {{have close}} relation with microstructure. Based on {{orientation of the}} molecule chain in fiber, they show a rapid increase in tensile properties. Nevertheless, block materials mainly gain rise of mechanical properties by blend or composite, it is hardly proposed on the <b>self-reinforced</b> <b>materials</b> by optimizing the microstructure. In this paper, a strengthening of PP was gained by uniaxial compression through small deformation of spherulite. A series of measurements were applied, including tensile test, polarizing optical microscope (POM) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The {{results show that the}} tensile properties of polypropylene (PP) have a rapid rise. POM suggestes that the spherulite has deformed into ellipsoid even belt along the orientation of sample of PP, which {{plays an important role in}} self-reinforcing of PP. And the initial melt point displayed by DSC slightly decreases because of the partial ruptures of crystal phase...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the synthesis and properties of liquid crystalline block copolymers comprised of alternating rigid and flexible blocks for {{the preparation of}} <b>self-reinforcing</b> <b>materials.</b> The incentive for this work was the expectation that the rigid segments would phase separate on a microscopic scale, and would form nematic domains, which will cause an enhanced orientation of the flexible segments leading to coil stretching. As a result the coils in the copolymer will be stiffer compared to unstretched coils, and the mechanical properties will be better than expected from the pure flexible polymer, therefore the term "self-reinforcement". For this purpose a block copolymer was synthesised that is comprised of alternating rigid poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA) (commercially known as Twaron or Kevlar) blocks and flexible coil polyamide 6, 6 (commercially known as nylon 6, 6) blocks. It is shown that if the aramid content in the copolymers is at least 50 mol% the polymers are able to show a lyotropic liquid crystalline phase in sulphuric acid. From these liquid crystalline solutions fibers have been spun that show promising mechanical properties. Due {{the combination of the}} rigid blocks providing stiffness and flexible blocks providing elasticity these block copolymers may be considered in high energy absorption applications.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} were twofold: (i) to develop a methodology for tailoring the nonlinear elastic response of a 2 D lattice material through designed microstructural geometric nonlinearities; and (ii) to show that activation of mechanophores (such as spiropyran) can be similarly manipulated through lattice geometry. Exploring this space may lead to new materials that can be engineered to yield prescribed mechanical and chemical loading responses, such as dissipating or focusing energy when struck or triggering chemical reactions under certain loads. The ability to customize these properties in a systematic way could facilitate the design and fabrication of advanced energetic, impact-mitigating, self-healing or <b>self-reinforcing</b> <b>materials.</b> In this thesis, a heuristic exploration of 2 D nonlinear lattices was conducted, in which lattices were designed, modeled in COMSOL, and then 3 D printed and quasi-statically tested to validate simulation results. A lattice that softens under compression, {{as well as two}} that stiffen under compression (using contact and non-contact based mechanisms) were created. A nonlinear topology optimization scheme using a MATLAB genetic algorithm and COMSOL Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was also created to find structures to match prescribed force-displacement curves: however, this topology optimizer struggled finding non-unique solutions and poorly connected structures. Spiropyran was embedded in PDMS and studied in quasi-static and dynamic compression. It was found that spiropyran activated at compressive strains greater than 0. 7 at both high and low strain rates and in less than 8 ms during dynamic tests. Finally, spiropyran was embedded in PCL and printed into an oval pore lattice shape; these samples, as well as control (non-lattice, bulk) samples were subjected to tensile tests. As spiropyran activation in the lattices was observed prior to activation in the control samples, these experiments suggest that microstructure can amplify mechanochemical response...|$|R
40|$|Weight {{reduction}} is commonly adopted in vehicle design {{as a means}} for energy and emissions savings. However, selection of lightweight materials is often focused on performance characteristics, which may lead to sub optimizations of life cycle environmental impact. Therefore systematic material selection processes are needed that integrate weight optimization and environmental life cycle assessment. This paper presents such an approach and its application to design of an automotive component. Materials from the metal, hybrid and polymer families were assessed, along with a novel <b>self-reinforced</b> composite <b>material</b> that is a potential lightweight alternative to non-recyclable composites. It was shown that materials offering the highest weight saving potential offer limited life cycle environmental benefit due to energy demanding manufacturing. Selection of the preferable alternative is not a straightforward process since results may be sensitive to critical but uncertain aspects of the life cycle. Such aspects need to be evaluated to determine the actual benefits of lightweight design and to base material selection on more informed choices. QC 20150911 </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>self-reinforced</b> polyethylene-based <b>materials</b> prepared by in-situ polymerisation is described. The methodology developed uses MCM- 41 mesoporous material in a triple role: as catalyst carrier for ethylene polymerisation within its pores and channels {{in a first}} stage, as nanofiller of the formed polyethylene matrixdur ing its useful lifetime and, finally, as promoter for long-term waste disposal. As evidenced by FTIR analysis, when the polymer is formed under these confined conditions different interactions between the MCM- 41 material and the polyethylene matrix occur, when compared to simple blends. The influence of the filler content on the rigidity of the resulting nanocomposites is analysed by microhardness measurements and corroborated by the storage modulus values: {{a significant increase in}} rigidity is observed as the filler contents rises. In addition, thermogravimetric studies show interesting features concerning the degradability of these materials. The catalytic action of MCM- 41 during degradation involves a reduction of the energetic requirements for their cracking and, therefore, a positive environmental impact...|$|R
40|$|Self-reinforced poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) {{composites}} {{prepared by}} using a modified film-stacking technique were examined in this study. The starting materials included a high tenacity PET yarn (reinforcement) and a low melting temperature biodegradable polyester resin (matrix), both of which differ in their melting temperatures with a value of 56 °C. This experiment produced composite sheets at three consolidation temperatures (Tc: 215, 225, and 235 °C) at a constant holding time (th: 6. 5 min), and three holding times (3, 6. 5 and 10 min) at a constant consolidation temperature of 225 °C. This study observed a significant improvement in the mechanical properties obtained in self-reinforced PET composites compared to the pure polyester resin. The results of tensile, flexural, and Izod impact tests proved that optimal conditions are low consolidation temperature and short holding time. The absorbed impact energy of the best <b>self-reinforced</b> PET composite <b>material</b> was 854. 0 J/m, which is 63 times that of pure polyester resin...|$|R
40|$|The {{vehicles}} {{of the future}} must have less negative environmental impact during their use phase than the {{vehicles of}} today {{in order to avoid}} major climate change on earth. Consequently electric vehicles are currently under development with the purpose of reducing CO 2 emissions when the vehicle is driven. There are also efforts put in to reducing the weight of vehicles {{in order to reduce the}} demand for energy to drive them. One important aspect of weight reduction is that new materials and technologies are developed. Plastic materials have low a density and can therefore be used to reduce the weight of vehicle components and with composite materials there is further potential for weight reduction. <b>Self-reinforced</b> thermoplastic composite <b>materials</b> are materials in which both reinforcement and matrix are thermoplastic materials and thanks to their low density and relatively good mechanical properties, these materials may be used for weight reduction of vehicle components.   The aim of this thesis is to study selected process parameters for component manufacturing with self-reinforced poly(ethylene terephthalate) (SrPET) in order to increase knowledge and thereby advance the field of self-reinforced PET composites. This thesis shows that stretching the material in the manufacturing process increases the mechanical performance of the material due to increased orientation of the amorphous phase in the PET reinforcement. However, stretching introduces stresses in the material that give rise to negative shape distortions in the formed component. The degree of stretching during forming must therefore be controlled in order to achieve a robust serial production. The concept of a SrPET component over-moulded for integration of stiffeners and attachments has been evaluated in a life-cycle-assessment. This evaluation shows that the component weight can be reduced compared to technology currently in use and thereby contribute to increased sustainability of transport. QC 20171215 </p...|$|R
