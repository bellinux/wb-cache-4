5|$|Lichtenstein {{frequently}} explored vision-related themes {{after he}} began {{to work in the}} pop art genre; early examples include I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! and Look Mickey. In this painting, Donald's large eyes indicate his belief that he has caught <b>something</b> <b>big</b> while Mickey's small eyes indicate his disbelief that Donald has caught anything significant. Like Lichenstein's works with subjects looking through a periscope (Torpedo...Los!), a mirror (Girl in Mirror) or a peephole (I Can See the Whole Room... and There's Nobody in It!), Look Mickey, with a subject looking at his reflection in the water, is a prominent example of the theme of vision. He uses narrative to emphasize this motif, while presenting several visual elements.|$|E

Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph also compared [...] "Cold Blood"'s concept and ideas to the original 1970 Silurians story but considered this story made [...] "less of an impact" [...] due to a [...] "black and white depiction" [...] and the one-dimensional Restac.
