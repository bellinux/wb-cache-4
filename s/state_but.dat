5|$|Although usually trivalent, {{ytterbium}} readily forms divalent compounds. This {{behavior is}} unusual for lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 {{state has a}} valence electron configuration of 4f14 because the fully filled f-shell gives more stability. The yellow-green ytterbium(II) ion {{is a very strong}} reducing agent and decomposes water, releasing hydrogen gas, and thus only the colorless ytterbium(III) ion occurs in aqueous solution. Samarium and thulium also behave this way in the +2 <b>state,</b> <b>but</b> europium(II) is stable in aqueous solution. Ytterbium metal behaves similarly to europium metal and the alkaline earth metals, dissolving in ammonia to form blue electride salts.|$|E
5|$|Andrzej Zahorski {{dedicated}} {{a book to}} {{the discussion}} of Poniatowski, The Dispute over Stanisław August (Spór o Stanisława Augusta, Warsaw, 1988). He notes that the discourse concerning Poniatowski is significantly colored {{by the fact that}} he was the last king of Poland – the king who failed to save the country. This failure, and his prominent position, made him a convenient scapegoat for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish <b>state,</b> <b>but</b> it was too late for that – he only succeeded in damaging his reputation for centuries to come.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that Mesolithic people settled {{in the region of}} York between 8000 and 7000BC, although it is not known whether their settlements were permanent or temporary. By the time of the Roman conquest of Britain, the area was occupied by a tribe known to the Romans as the Brigantes. The Brigantian tribal area initially became a Roman client <b>state,</b> <b>but,</b> later its leaders became more hostile and the Roman Ninth Legion was sent north of the Humber into Brigantian territory.|$|E

5|$|Casinos {{and race}} tracks were closed because {{official}} monitors from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and the New Jersey Racing Commission, respectively, {{were categorized as}} non-essential. At the time, New Jersey law precluded gambling establishments from operating absent state oversight. Originally, the race tracks were scheduled to close with the first wave on July 1, but a State Court order allowed them to close later. The casinos attempted a similar case, arguing that the state monitors overseeing the casinos were not paid by the <b>state</b> <b>but</b> by the casinos themselves, but the appeal was rejected at the New Jersey Supreme Court; therefore {{they were forced to}} close.|$|E
