30|$|<b>Suprapubic</b> <b>catheters</b> are {{associated}} with less pain and urgency than urethral catheterization following RARP (Krane et al. 2009; Orikasa et al. 2012), however many patients may object {{to the creation of}} a cystostomy for the purpose of pain control.

5000|$|Another {{causative factor}} {{may be an}} undetected urinary tract infection. The {{difficulty}} in assessing this may be complicated with the usage of indwelling or <b>suprapubic</b> <b>catheters.</b> When a painful stimulus occurs, as when voiding is interrupted or a bowel obstruction occurs, nerve impulses are sent to the brain via the spinal cord. [...] However, in spinal cord transection, these impulses are unable to travel past the injury. This results in a spinal cord reflex to the autonomic nervous system in response to pain. In patients with spinal cord transection, types of stimulation that are tolerated by healthy people create an excessive response from the person's nervous system.|$|R

Traditionally, inserted large-bore <b>suprapubic</b> <b>catheters</b> may cause fatal complications. During the past decade, we used a small central venous catheter (CVC) suprapubicly in 16 male patients {{for the purpose of}} urinary drainage, when transurethral catheterization failed. The procedure is performed in no more than 10 minutes. Success rate was 100 % and this approach did not lead to any complications. In conclusion, placing a CVC for suprapubic drainage is a safe method with a high success rate and we recommend it in patients with failed transurethral catheterization after a few attempts (2 – 3 attempts).

40|$|Catheter-associated {{urinary tract}} infections (CAUTIs) {{represent}} {{the most common}} type of nosocomial infection and are a major health concern due to the complications and frequent recurrence. These infections are often caused by Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Gram-negative bacterial species that cause CAUTIs express a number of virulence factors associated with adhesion, motility, biofilm formation, immunoavoidance, and nutrient acquisition as well as factors that cause damage to the host. These infections can be reduced by limiting catheter usage and ensuring that health care professionals correctly use closed-system Foley catheters. A number of novel approaches such as condom and <b>suprapubic</b> <b>catheters,</b> intermittent catheterization, new surfaces, catheters with antimicrobial agents, and probiotics have thus far met with limited success. While the diagnosis of symptomatic versus asymptomatic CAUTIs may be a contentious issue, it is generally agreed that once a catheterized patient is believed to have a symptomatic urinary tract infection, the catheter is removed if possible due to the high rate of relapse. Research focusing on the pathogenesis of CAUTIs will lead to a better understanding of the disease process and will subsequently lead to the development of new diagnosis, prevention, and treatment options...|$|R
50|$|Penis burns can be {{very severe}} and often require {{specialized}} care in a burn unit to prevent contractures, severe scarring, or other complications including lymphedema, hypospadias, or necrosis. This treatment can involve debridement, skin grafts, antibiotics, {{and the use of}} a <b>suprapubic</b> <b>catheter.</b> Because of its thin skin, the penis is susceptible to full-thickness, third-degree burns. Burns to the penis typically co-occur with other severe burns. Most thermal penis burns are first or second degree burns caused by flame; some are caused by grease or boiling water. Electrical burns are typically deeper than thermal burns and require more extensive tissue removal.|$|E
50|$|Antibiotics are {{the first}} line of {{treatment}} in acute prostatitis (Cat. I). Antibiotics usually resolve acute prostatitis infections in a very short time, however a minimum of two to four weeks of therapy is recommended to eradicate the offending organism completely. Appropriate antibiotics should be used, based on the microbe causing the infection. Some antibiotics have very poor penetration of the prostatic capsule, others, such as Ciprofloxacin, Co-trimoxazole and tetracyclines such as doxycycline penetrate well. In acute prostatitis, penetration of the prostate is not as important as for category II because the intense inflammation disrupts the prostate-blood barrier. It is more important to choose a bacteriocidal antibiotic (kills bacteria, e.g. quinolone) rather than a bacteriostatic antibiotic (slows bacterial growth, e.g. tetracycline) for acute potentially life-threatening infections. Severely ill patients may need hospitalization, while nontoxic patients can be treated at home with bed rest, analgesics, stool softeners, and hydration. Patients in urinary retention are best managed with a <b>suprapubic</b> <b>catheter</b> or intermittent catheterization. Lack of clinical response to antibiotics should raise the suspicion of an abscess and prompt an imaging study such as a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS).|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to explore the value of audit in {{investigating}} and reducing the length of stay (LOS) of patients after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). All TURPs in a district general hospital (DGH) were audited over 30 weeks. Particular attention was paid to patients whose LOS was longer than the average for the group (mean: 6. 4 nights; median: 5 nights). Older age of the patient, larger resections and late removal of <b>suprapubic</b> <b>catheters</b> were statistically significant in prolonging LOS (P < 0. 001). General anaesthesia was associated with longer stay than regional anaesthesia, but the difference was not statistically significant. Among patients whose LOS exceeded the average of 6 nights, social circumstances and detrusor underactivity were the most important causes of late discharge, accounting for 44 % (28 / 63) of these cases. Where factors were avoidable, changes were implemented. Increased use of regional anaesthesia was encouraged. Catheters were removed earlier, and discharges, whenever possible, were pre-planned. A re-audit was carried out 1 year after the original audit and a significant decrease in LOS was found (mean: 5. 2 nights; median: 4 nights; P < 0. 01). Audit can increase awareness of prolonged hospital stay and highlight areas for change. Re-audit can confirm the effectiveness of these changes...|$|R

Although {{urinary tract infection}} (UTI) {{is the most common}} hospital-acquired infection in the United States, to our knowledge, no national data exist describing what hospitals in the United States are doing to prevent this patient safety problem. We conducted a national study to examine the current practices used by hospitals to prevent hospital-acquired UTI. Methods. We mailed written surveys to infection control coordinators at a national random sample of non-federal US hospitals with an intensive care unit and 50 hospital beds () and to all Veterans Affairs (VA) np 600 hospitals (). The survey asked about practices to prevent hospital-acquired UTI and other device-associatednp 119 infections. Results. The response rate was 72 %. Overall, 56 % of hospitals did not have a system for monitoring which patients had urinary catheters placed, and 74 % did not monitor catheter duration. Thirty percent of hospitals reported regularly using antimicrobial urinary catheters and portable bladder scanners; 14 % used condom catheters, and 9 % used catheter reminders.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{calculate}} {{the prevalence of}} long term catheter use in the community in two areas {{in the south and}} west of England. SUBJECTS/PATIENTS (OR MATERIALS) AND METHODS: People in England register with general practices to access health care through a National Health Service. Catheters are provided by prescription free of charge. In 2008, patients using urinary catheters for over 3 months were identified, and demographic information collected, from databases of general practices, using catheter prescribing records. The age and sex distributions of people in each practice were obtained from capitation claims. Overall, and age and sex-specific prevalence were calculated separately for each area, and compared. RESULTS: A total of 583 long term catheter users (329 south, 254 west) were identified from 404, 328 people registered with practices. The overall population prevalence is similar in both locations (0. 146 % southern, 0. 141 % western). Extrapolating for the United Kingdom, this is over 90, 000 long term catheter users. Prevalence increases with age (0. 732 % in over 70 years, 1. 224 % over 80), especially amongst men. Overall, higher proportions have neurological (vs. non-neurological) reasons (62. 9 % vs. 37. 1 %) and use urethral (vs. <b>suprapubic)</b> <b>catheters</b> (59. 7 % vs. 40. 3 %). Compared to men, more women tend to use suprapubic (56. 4 % vs. 29. 3 %) and have a catheter for neurological reasons (71. 8 % vs. 56. 2 %, P?=? 0. 053). CONCLUSIONS: Previous evidence on prevalence of long term catheter use is sparse, and of variable quality.

40|$|Candida tropicalis is a {{frequently}} isolated yeast species causing bloodstream, {{urinary tract}} and other infections particularly in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) and those requiring prolonged urinary catheterization (UC) or receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (BSA). This study investigated clinical characteristics and genetic relatedness among C. tropicalis strains isolated from patients at Al-Amiri Hospital in Kuwait. C. tropicalis strains (n = 63) isolated from blood, genito-urinary, respiratory (RT) and digestive (GIT) tracts and wound sites from 54 patients were used. All isolates were phenotypically identified and tested against six antifungal drugs by using Vitek 2 system. Molecular identification {{was performed by}} PCR amplification of rDNA. Fingerprinting was achieved by 6 -loci-based multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and data were analyzed by BioNumerics software for phylogenetic relationships. Patients mean age was > 65 years and > 20 % patients were hospitalized in ICUs. Most patients had underlying conditions that included UC, BSA, diabetes and RT/GIT abnormalities. Most candiduria cases had UC, ureteric stent or <b>suprapubic</b> <b>catheters.</b> All isolates were identified as C. tropicalis by Vitek 2 and by species-specific PCR. Sixty-two isolates were susceptible to all tested antifungal drugs. MLST identified 59 diploid sequence types (DSTs) including 54 newly-identified DSTs. C. tropicalis isolates from multiple sites of same patient usually belonged to different DSTs. Interestingly, 56 of 57 isolates from 48 patients belonged to unique genotypes. Only six isolates from six patients belonged to three DSTs (clusters), however, C. tropicalis strains in each cluster were isolated > 3 months apart. Our data show diverse origins of C. tropicalis infections in Kuwait as most isolates were unique strains. There was no obvious correlation between cluster isolates with time of isolation and/or hospital ward of their origin. This study presents the first MLST analysis of C. tropicalis isolates from Middle East and may be useful for studying genetic relationships among global C. tropicalis strains...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) patients, no {{correlation}} {{was found between the}} number of bladder infections per year, the period since injury, the neurologic level of the spinal cord lesion and the histopathology of the urinary bladder mucosa. The use of chronic indwelling urethral and/or <b>suprapubic</b> <b>catheters</b> in SCI patients is often associated with inflammatory and proliferative pathological conditions in neuropathic bladder. Presentation of the hypothesis We propose a hypothesis that the type of bladder drainage in SCI patients influences the histological changes in the mucosa of neuropathic bladder. This hypothesis implies that SCI patients with long-term indwelling urinary catheters develop certain histological changes in bladder mucosa, which are seen less frequently in SCI patients, who do not use long-term indwelling catheters. The latter group includes patients, who perform regular intermittent catheterisation and those, who wear a penile sheath and empty their bladders satisfactorily by reflex voiding. We hypothesise that the following histological lesions are seen more frequently in the neuropathic bladder of SCI patients with long-term indwelling catheters. (1) Papillary or polypoid cystitis; (2) widespread cystitis glandularis; (3) moderate to severe, acute and chronic inflammatory changes in bladder mucosa; (4) follicular cystitis; (5) squamous metaplasia; and (6) urothelial dysplasia As per this hypothesis, it is postulated that the above pathological conditions are seen less often in SCI patients, who achieve complete, low-pressure emptying of the neuropathic bladder by regular intermittent catheterisation, and SCI patients with penile sheath drainage, who empty their bladders satisfactorily by reflex voiding. Testing the hypothesis A large prospective study of bladder biopsies in SCI patients practising different methods of bladder drainage is required to validate this hypothesis that the histological changes in bladder mucosa are related to the method of bladder drainage in SCI patients. Implications of the hypothesis We propose a hypothesis that the method of bladder drainage in SCI patients influences histological changes in the bladder mucosa. If this hypothesis is validated, methods of bladder drainage such as intermittent catheterisation, which do not require the use of chronic indwelling catheters, should be recommended, in order to minimise adverse histological changes in the mucosa of neuropathic bladder of {{spinal cord injury}} patients. </p...|$|R
