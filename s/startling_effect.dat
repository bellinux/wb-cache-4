40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{conducted}} a two-part study {{of age and}} latent inhibition in the rat. In {{the first part of}} the study, rats given odor–shock pairings at 23 or 75 days of age exhibited a potentiated startle response in the presence of the odor the following day. This effect did not occur in rats trained at 16 or 20 days of age. Odor pre-exposure on the day prior to conditioning markedly reduced the odor potentiation of <b>startle</b> <b>effect</b> in 23 - and 75 -day-old rats but had no effect in 16 and 20 -day-olds. In the second part of the study, rats were pre-exposed to the odor at 16 or 20 days of age and then conditioned at 23 days of age. When tested the day after conditioning, these pre-exposed rats exhibited a disruption in the odor potentiation of <b>startle</b> <b>effect.</b> We compare our results with other studies of latent inhibition, and with recent studies on whether conditioned responses are appropriate to the animal’s age a...|$|R

The specific question posed was as follows: The industry considers a delay of 100 ms technically achievable, but is it acceptable from the human factors point of view? The evidence considered included consequences {{for the quality of}} driver performance and possible <b>startle</b> <b>effects.</b> In discussing the quality of driver performance, the following aspects were considered: eyeblinks, voluntary occlusions of vision during driving, fixations away from straight ahead (on rearview mirrors, vehicle controls and displays, and navigation systems), head movements when checking traffic in the blind spots, and time-to-collision and time-to-lanecrossing measures. Possible effects of different implementations of the secondary light source (high-intensity discharge and incandescent) were also briefly discussed. Based on the available evidence concerning the quality of driver performance (excluding <b>startle</b> <b>effects),</b> a delay of 100 ms or less is unlikely to create safety problems. Furthermore, although little evidence exists on the likelihood and nature of startle responses, it is unlikely that a delay of 100 ms or less will lead to major negative startle consequences...|$|R

The authors argue that threat has the <b>effect</b> of potentiating <b>startle</b> <b>effects</b> and has significant deleterious effects on cognition. This could contribute to poor performance following an unexpected critical event in aviation. They discuss training strategies for improved performance, which would expose pilots to unexpected critical events more often, and develop greater self-efficacy.|$|R

5|$|The pupae of some moths {{are able}} to wriggle their abdomen. The three caudal {{segments}} of the pupal abdomen (segments 8–10) are fixed; the other segments are movable to some degree. While the more evolved Lepidoptera can wriggle only the last two-three segments {{at the end of}} the abdomen, more basal taxa such as the Micropterigidae can wriggle the remaining seven segments of the abdomen; this presumably helps them to protrude the anterior end from the pupal case before eclosion. The pupae of Hepialidae {{are able to}} move back and forth in the larval tunnel by wriggling, aided by projections on the back in addition to spines. Abdominal wriggling is considered to be of startle value and discouraging to predators. In the case of a few hawk moths, such as Theretra latreillii, the wriggling of the abdomens is accompanied by a rattling or clicking sound which adds to the <b>startle</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|R

Experimental results of a novel 15 Hz visual lane tracking system will be discussed, focusing on the particle filter and cue fusion technology used.

40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} {{reliability of}} the modern airliner continues to make aviation a very safe mode of transport. This reliability does not however extend to pilots it would seem, with major lapses in performance during critical events a common theme in major incidents and accidents. The conditioned expectation of normalcy amongst pilots may contribute to underperformance during surprise critical events, resulting in poor handling of complex situations. The <b>effects</b> of <b>startle,</b> an autonomic reaction with deleterious effects on information processing, may be a strong contributor to poor pilot performance during critical events. These effects may seriously impair situational awareness, decision making and problem solving, all critical skills in the handling of a complex emergency.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of startle during unexpected critical events {{has been shown}} to adversely affect flight safety in a number of high profile accidents over recent years. Additionally, flight simulator startle experiments conducted by the authors, showed approximately one-third of pilots were significantly affected by startle during an instrument approach, leading to undesired aircraft states in a critical phase of flight. Training interventions for managing startle have been largely uncoordinated to date, however a holistic program of prevention and recovery training is proposed. Prevention strategies include improved training and attention in situational awareness skill sets, and particularly pilot monitoring skills, developing greater expectation and efficacy for managing unexpected critical events, and greater awareness of <b>startle</b> <b>effects.</b> Recovery strategies include more focus on evidence based training, improved training on avoidance, recognition and management of undesired aircraft states, and exposure to unexpected critical events during training. Adopting holistic training interventions for managing startle will have other benefits including improved threat and error management, and improved prevention of, and recovery from, undesired aircraft states.
