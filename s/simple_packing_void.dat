40|$|Changes to {{the soil}} occur as land-use {{practices}} are modified. These changes may include improvements but more commonly result in degradation, which may be obvious or subtle. The latter type is addressed here. In this case the degradation represents limited changes {{to the soil}} such that once recovered there is little apparent evidence that recalls this disturbance history. How this history is deciphered represents a compelling challenge to soil science that necessarily incorporates obvious signs of soil degradation, stratigraphic principles, archaeological principles and pedo-forensics at scales ranging from micro to macro. The challenge is to determine which features {{can be used in}} a diagnostic sense. Undoubtedly, these will differ between different environments, land-use practices and recovery time. Morphological indicators of different land use regimes may be revealed in soil colour, structure and texture and this leads naturally to confirmation using microscopic techniques that includes microstructure as well as the presence of exotic components. Often a stratigraphic approach is required to provide a geomorphic context such as when former upslope soil material now constitutes the downslope topsoil. Chemical changes often occur too. Several examples are used to illustrate this. Forest clearance offers the most compelling case especially where the litter layer and the bioturbated surface layer are replaced by very different features such as surface crusting and the presence of mineral soil at the surface. This is often associated with an increase in bulk density, reduced organic matter, and a reduction in larger biovoids. Changes within grassland systems may be less obvious if little disturbed. Further changes are apparent when compaction occurs, which must lead to a decrease in pore size, even of <b>simple</b> <b>packing</b> <b>voids.</b> More telling is the appearance of horizontal planar voids, which imparts a platy structure in the near surface that reflects the applied stresses imposed from above. Biovoids may display a radial fracture pattern in this situation. Changes in drainage that affects the redoximorphic status of the soil may lead to the superimposition of a set of features commensurate with this. However, many of these features are gradually lost as recovery occurs and this results in a greater reliance on general stratigraphy and the presence of exotics and perhaps local historical knowledge of land use change. Such information was used by soil surveyors in Eastern USA in the early 1900 's in delineating phases. In South-Eastern Australia, post-settlement alluvium (i. e. deposited since European settlement and mostly < 200 years old) blankets many valley floors. For many years it remained unknown in soil science circles since the material is often cultivated and even built upon (often an effective disguise) and treated as a natural part of the soil-landscape. Nevertheless, it often displays a paler colour, lower organic matter, preservation of bedding and a platy structure which readily distinguishes it from pre-settlement material. European artefacts, including partly to completely buried fence posts, fragments of porcelain etc., and/or OSL dating confirm the interpretation. Its identity was revealed during geomorphic investigations of valley fills. The source of these deposits has often been attributed to reworking of older valley fills but in at least one study the main source area is the adjacent valley sides with the evidence seemingly hidden within the topsoils of varying thickness. 1 page(s...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{nature and}} {{distribution}} of amino acids in the helix interfaces of four polytopic membrane proteins (cytochrome c oxidase, bacteriorhodopsin, the photosynthetic reaction center of Rhodobacter sphaeroides, and the potassium channel of Streptomyces lividans) are studied to address the role of glycine in transmembrane helix packing. In contrast to soluble proteins where glycine is a noted helix breaker, the backbone dihedral angles of glycine in transmembrane helices largely fall in the standard α-helical region of a Ramachandran plot. An analysis of helix packing reveals that glycine residues in the transmembrane region of these proteins are predominantly oriented toward helix-helix interfaces and have a high occurrence at helix crossing points. Moreover, <b>packing</b> <b>voids</b> are generally not formed at the position of glycine in folded protein structures. This suggests that transmembrane glycine residues mediate helix-helix interactions in polytopic membrane proteins in a fashion similar to that seen in oligomers of membrane proteins with single membrane-spanning helices.

Contact-angle (θ) measurements revealed that the apparent θ decreased from partially hydrophobic (θ ∼ 62 °) to more hydrophilic (θ ∼ 47 °) when the corn starch was first added, leading to foams with a reduced stability. As the concentration of corn starch reached above ∼ 8 vol. %, θ returned back to greater than 60 °, rendering then a stable foam. On the other hand, θ was found to decrease from 57 ° to 50 ° when the agar concentration increased above a mere 0. 16 vol. %.

40|$|This {{experimental}} study examines the micromorphological changes resulting from confined swelling and shrinking of aggregated samples. Two factors, namely bulk density (two levels) and sample composition (five levels) were considered. Thin sections were cut and the microfabrics studied in detail both qualitatively and quantitatively. A {{broad range of}} significant and systematic microfabric changes were observed. With {{an increase in the}} activity and content of the clay fraction, the void volume (especially those > 30 μm) decreased drastically whereas the shape changed from compound <b>packing</b> <b>voids</b> to occluded planar voids and vughs. Aggregates were flattened at contacts, became more angular and showed evidence of fusion into compound units. Related distribution patterns were altered from dominantly matrigranic to matrigranoidic, fragmoidic and porphyric with scattered vughs. There was a gradual closing of voids and a concomitant coalescence of aggregates. Plasmic fabrics showed mainly an increase in long (> 10 μm) and narrow (< 5 μm) but sharply defined plasma separations. High bulk density resulted in a more vigorous and conspicuous expression of fabric unit deformation and movement.

40|$|Single domain {{proteins}} {{are thought}} to be tightly packed. The introduction of voids by mutations is often regarded as destabilizing. In this study we show that packing density for single domain proteins decreases with chain length. We find that the radius of gyration provides poor description of protein packing but the alpha contact number we introduce here characterize proteins well. We further demonstrate that protein-like scaling relationship between packing density and chain length is observed in off-lattice self-avoiding walks. A key problem in studying compact chain polymer is the attrition problem: It is difficult to generate independent samples of compact long self-avoiding walks. We develop an algorithm based on the framework of sequential Monte Carlo and succeed in generating populations of compact long chain off-lattice polymers up to length $N= 2, 000 $. Results based on analysis of these chain polymers suggest that maintaining high packing density is only characteristic of short chain proteins. We found that the scaling behavior of packing density with chain length of proteins is a generic feature of random polymers satisfying loose constraint in compactness.
