2500|$|In 1928, he {{graduated}} from the Technical University of Stuttgart with a diploma in engineering and began to focus on aircraft construction. Over the next decade, he would also tour the world, promoting gliding throughout Europe, the United States, Japan, South America, and South Africa. On 10 March 1931 he gave a demonstration of glider aerobatics over New York City. On one of these publicity trips, he suffered major injuries in a crash in Hungary, requiring a hospital stay of four months. He and Robert Kronfeld were the first pilots to gain the <b>Silver</b> <b>C</b> badge. He was the chief flying instructor at the Grünau Gliding School in the Riesengebirge mountains, then in Germany. [...] In 1933, he became the Head of the new Gliding School in Hornberg.|$|E
2500|$|The Karakán was {{designed}} {{at the request}} of the Hungarian Boy Scouts Association, which wanted a new Hungarian glider to represent the sport at the 1933 Jamboree. It was built in their workshops and made its first flight on 4 August 1933, during the Jamboree. A second Karakán was built in the workshops of the Aviation Section of the Hungarian Defence Association (MOVERO), flying on 29 April 1935. Between them they set a series of Hungarian national gliding records and Rotter used it to become the first Hungarian to gain a <b>Silver</b> <b>C.</b> [...] When the first example retired in 1939 it was placed on display in the Hungarian Technical and Transportation Museum, Budapest, where it was destroyed in the fighting towards the end of World War II. The second was destroyed in a hangar fire in 1942.|$|E

In June 1938, he broke the British National Distance Gain of Height gliding record at 10,180 feet over Dunstable Downs, earning him the world's third Gold C Badge.

Reitsch contracted with the Ufa Film Company as a stunt pilot and set an unofficial endurance record for women of eleven hours and twenty minutes. In January 1934, she joined a South America expedition to study thermal conditions, along with Wolf Hirth, Peter Riedel and Heini Dittmar. While in Argentina, she became the first woman to earn the <b>Silver</b> <b>C</b> Badge, the 25th to do so among world glider pilots.|$|E

40|$|Silver salts of {{the higher}} {{straight-chain}} alkanoic acids (silver soaps) and especially silver(I) behenate and silver(l) stearate are being used as the silver source in thermographic and photothermographic materials. The silver(l) alkanoates exhibit a complicated thermal behavior, and different phase transitions can be detected between the solid, crystalline state and the onset point of thermal decomposition. The phase transitions are due to a gradual breakdown of the layerlike structure of these compounds, {{and some of the}} phases are viscous mesophases. The silver alkanoates of the homologous series between <b>silver</b> propionate (<b>C</b> 3 H 5 O 2 Ag) and <b>silver</b> tetracosanoate (<b>C</b> 24 H 47 O 2 Ag) have been prepared, as well as <b>silver</b> hexacosanoate (<b>C</b> 26 H 51 O 2 Ag) and <b>silver</b> octacosanoate (<b>C</b> 28 H 55 O 2 Ag). The light stability of the compounds increases with increasing chain length. The room-temperature X-ray diffractograms indicate that the silver alkanoates consist of a bilayer structure. The thermal properties of these silver-containing metallomesogens were investigated by high-temperature X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and polarizing optical microscopy. The number {{and the nature of the}} phase transitions depends on the alkyl chain length. The thermal decomposition of the silver alkanoates with long alkyl chains proceeds in a liquid-crystalline state (mesophase), and leads to the formation of silver. The thermal behavior of silver behenate is discussed in detail. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Karl Baur {{was born}} November 13, 1911 in Laichingen, Württemberg, Germany. In 1927 heattended {{a summer camp}} for young boys {{interested}} in aviation, and {{it was here that}} Baurdeveloped his desire to fly. He became involved in the world of glider flying during the1930s, where with the F1 Fledermaus glider he completed the necessary distance, height,and acrobatic flying requirements to earn an International <b>Silver</b> <b>C</b> Badge in 1934. (Only19 of these were awarded at that year, and Baur was one of 15 Germans who received thebadge.) Baur also worked with powered aircraft and earned a private pilot license in1931.|$|E
50|$|The Avia 41-P flew for {{the first}} time in late 1932, piloted by Georges Bouvier. He had {{completed}} the test flights by mid-January 1934 and then took it on a France-wide demonstration tour which lasted until about September. In late August its part-designer Eric Nessler began a series of flights setting new French gliding records for distance and for duration. By the end of the year he had made a flight of 54 km and another lasting 11 hr 27 min, helping him to gain his <b>Silver</b> <b>C</b> badge in 1936. He was the first French pilot to do so.|$|E
50|$|The Zanonia {{made its}} contest debut with Ross flying {{it in the}} 1937 US Nationals, where he placed third, but {{completed}} his <b>Silver</b> <b>C</b> badge. The aircraft won {{second place in the}} Eaton Design Contest to the Schultz ABC, a competition that was open to any new American glider design that had not been flown at a previous National Championship. The rules required drawings and stress analysis data to be presented with the completed aircraft. The intention was that the winning design would be made available as drawings and kits for amateur construction and that Bureau of Air Commerce design approval would be eventually obtained as well.|$|E
