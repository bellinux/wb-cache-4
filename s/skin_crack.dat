After several failed attempts at stopping the crack by drilling stop-holes, the crack was repeatedly repaired by affixing doublers (metal patches intended to take over the load from the damaged part, a normal repair procedure for minor skin damage), which were riveted over the cracked skin. However, the crack continued to grow, requiring longer and longer doublers to be fitted. Although the <b>skin</b> <b>crack</b> was slowly getting longer it was not thought to be anything other than a skin problem, which could be dealt with by affixing a doubler.|$|E

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper deals with the application of different sensor technologies for fatigue crack damage monitoring of metallic helicopter fuselages. A test programme has been conducted, consisting of seven fatigue crack propagation tests on aluminium panels (skin with riveted stringers) representative of the rear fuselage of a helicopter. Electrical crack gauges and comparative vacuum monitoring sensors have been used locally to monitor propagating cracks. A network of optical fibre Bragg gratings is presented as a valid possibility for distributed monitoring (based on strain field dependence on damage), alternative to consolidated electrical resistance-based strain gauges. A Smart Layer based on piezoelectric transducers that emit and receive Lamb wave signals has also been analysed in this paper for distributed monitoring. Two damages have been considered: a <b>skin</b> <b>crack</b> artificially initiated on a panel bay and a <b>skin</b> <b>crack</b> propagating from a rivet hole after stringer failure. Damage sensitivity has been evaluated and compared among the considered technologies, thus providing useful recommendations for each considered system, together with advantages and drawbacks concerning their suitability for on-board installation and monitoring. The damage index sensitivity to operative condition, load in particular, is verified and compared with damage effect for distributed networks. A finite element model able to describe any selected feature sensitivity to the monitored damage is also presented as a useful tool for the optimization of the structural health monitoring system design process...|$|E

The load bearing capability and crack growth characteristic of both types of the stiffened panels having same configuration subjected to distributed tensile load is examined in this paper. A fourteen-stringer stiffened panel is analyzed for a central <b>skin</b> <b>crack</b> propagating towards the adjacent stringers. Stress intensity factors and fatigue crack propagation rates of both types of the stiffened panels are then compared. The analysis results show that integral stiffening causes higher stress intensity factor than conventional stiffened panel as the crack tip passes through the stringer and the integrally stiffened panel has less load bearing capability than the riveted stiffened panel...|$|E

By means of LEAF, an extensive parametric analysis of stiffened panels, representative of typical aeronautical constructions, was performed to provide meaningful design guidelines. The effects of riveted, integral and adhesively bonded stringers on the fatigue crack propagation performances of stiffened panels were investigated, as well as the crack retarder contribution using metallic straps (named doublers) bonded {{in the middle of the}} stringers bays. The effect of both perfectly bonded and partially debonded doublers was investigated as well. Adhesively bonded stiffeners showed the best DT properties in comparison with riveted and integral ones.

40|$|Cracks in thin layers are {{influenced}} by what lies beneath them. From buried craters to crocodile <b>skin,</b> <b>crack</b> patterns are found over an enormous range of length scales. Regardless of absolute size, their substrates can dramatically influence how cracks form, guiding them in some cases, or shielding regions from them in others. Here we investigate how a substrate’s shape affects the appearance of cracks above it, by preparing mud cracks over sinusoidally varying surfaces. We find that as {{the thickness of the}} cracking layer increases, the observed crack patterns change from wavy to ladder-like to isotropic. Two order parameters are introduced to measure the relative alignment of these crack networks, and, along with Fourier methods, are used to characterise the transitions between crack pattern types. Finally, we explain these results with a model, based on the Griffith criteria of fracture, that identifies the conditions for which straight or wavy cracks will be seen, and predicts how well-ordered the cracks will be. Our metrics and results can be applied to any situation where connected networks of cracks are expected, or found...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} is presented on fatigue crack growth behavior and fail safety of integral stringer panels typified by welded aircraft fabrications. The stringer panel {{is made of}} aluminum alloy 2024 -T 351 and fabricated by the variable-polarity plasma-arc welding process. The sample simulates {{a part of the}} lower-wing skin structures. Based on the linear elastic fracture mechanics, numerical simulations are performed for two configurations, two-stringer and nine-stringer panels, and three damage scenarios, in which welding-induced longitudinal residual stresses are taken into account. A typical load spectrum for large transport aircraft is employed for the analysis. For the two-stringer panel life predictions have a reasonably good correlation with the test results. Based on this validation, large-scale nine-stringer panels with three manufacture options, that is, riveted, integrally machined, and welded integral, are simulated for a <b>skin</b> <b>crack</b> under a broken central stringer propagating to two-bay length.

40|$|Artificial neural {{networks}} (ANN) are extensively utilized in structural health monitoring. Nevertheless, {{the definition of}} a rigorous method for the optimization of their structure is still an unresolved issue, especially when applied to safety critical systems. In this paper, an approach typically adopted in the design of experiments and based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to statistically determine the number of hidden neurons in a three-layer ANN structure. Repeated trainings of the same network structure provide multiple observations of the performance index here, based on the root mean square error. Different levels of network structure complexity are statistically compared, {{based on the number of}} hidden nodes. ANOVA is used to determine whether there is statistical evidence that the network performance is influenced by the number of hidden nodes. This analysis allows defining the threshold number of hidden nodes above which there is no statistical evidence of a performance benefit by the increase of the ANN structure complexity. The method is applied to the optimization of a set of algorithms for the diagnosis of fatigue damage on a typical aeronautical structure, consisting of a metallic panel with a riveted skin-stringer construction. The ANNs for damage detection, localization, and quantification are trained and validated with finite element simulated strain data and are finally tested on experimental strain signals, acquired in real-time in a fatigue crack growth laboratory test program including a <b>skin</b> <b>crack</b> artificially initiated in a panel bay and two stringers that had failed naturally under fatigue load...|$|E
40|$|This work {{demonstrates}} {{the feasibility of}} using a composite blast shield for hardening an overhead bin compartment of a commercial aircraft. If {{a small amount of}} explosive escapes detection and is brought onboard and stowed in an overhead bin compartment of a passenger aircraft, the current bins provide no protection against a blast inside the compartment. A blast from the overhead bin will certainly damage the fuselage and likely lead to catastrophic inflight structural failure. The feasibility of using an inner blast shield to harden the overhead bin compartment of a Boeing 737 aircraft to protect the fuselage skin in such a threat scenario has been demonstrated using field tests. The blast shield was constructed with composite material based on the unibody concept. The design was carried out using LS-DYNA finite element model simulations. Material panels were first designed to pass the FAA shock holing and fire tests. The finite element model included the full coupling of the overhead bin with the fuselage structure accounting for all the different structural connections. A large number of iterative simulations were carried out to optimize the fiber stacking sequence and shield thickness to minimize weight and achieve the design criterion. Three designs, the basic, thick, and thin shields, were field-tested using a frontal fuselage section of the Boeing 737 – 100 aircraft. The basic and thick shields protected the integrity of the fuselage skin with no <b>skin</b> <b>crack.</b> This work provides very encouraging results and useful data for optimization implementation of the blast shield design for hardening overhead compartments against the threat of small explosives...|$|E

The aim of the current study was to identify the pattern of patients' use of CAM products in dealing with diabetic foot disorders topically in a group of diabetic patients. Findings A Cross-sectional descriptive study of a representative cohort of diabetic patients living in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia was designed. A pre-designed questionnaire to identify local diabetics' practices in dealing topically with foot disorders including open wound, chronic ulcer, and <b>skin</b> <b>cracks</b> was designed. Questionnaire was administered by a group of trained nutrition female students to diabetics face to face living in their neighborhood. A total of 1634 Saudi diabetics were interviewed. Foot disorders occurred in approximately two thirds of the respondents 1006 (61. 6 %). Out of the 1006 patients who had foot disorders, 653 reported trying some sort of treatment as 307 patients (47. 1 %) used conventional topical medical treatment alone, 142 (21. 7 %) used CAM products alone, and 204 (31. 2 %) used both treatments. The most commonly used CAM product by the patients was Honey (56. 6 %) followed by Commiphora Molmol (Myrrh) in (37. 4 %) and Nigellia Sativa (Black seed) in (35. 1 %). The least to be used was Lawsonia inermis (Henna) in (12. 1 %). Ten common natural preparations used topically to treat diabetic foot disorders were also identified. Conclusions The use of CAM products in topical treatment of diabetic foot disorders is fairly common among Saudi diabetic patients. Honey headed the list as a solo topical preparation or in combination with other herbs namely black seeds and myrrh. The efficacy of the most common products needs further research. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} experimental flight test vibration measurements and structural inspections {{performed by the}} Federal Aviation Administration`s Airworthiness Assurance NDI Validation Center (AANC) at Sandia National Laboratories and the US Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (ARSC). Structural and aerodynamic changes induced by mounting a Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) system on a USCG HC- 130 H aircraft are described. The FLIR adversely affected the air flow characteristics and structural vibration on the external skin of the aircraft`s right main wheel well fairing. Upon initial discovery of <b>skin</b> <b>cracking</b> and visual observation of skin vibration in flight by the FLIR, a baseline flight without the FLIR was conducted and compared to other measurements with the FLIR installed. Nondestructive inspection procedures were developed to detect <b>cracks</b> in the <b>skin</b> and supporting structural elements and document the initial structural condition of the aircraft. Inspection results and flight test vibration data revealed that the FLIR created higher than expected flight loading and was the possible source of the <b>skin</b> <b>cracking.</b> The Coast Guard performed significant structural repair and enhancement on this aircraft, and additional in-flight vibration measurements were collected on the strengthened area both with and without the FLIR installed. After three months of further operational FLIR usage, the new aircraft skin with the enhanced structural modification was reinspected and found {{to be free of}} flaws. Additional US Coast Guard HC- 130 H aircraft are now being similarly modified to accommodate this FLIR system. Measurements of in-flight vibration levels with and without the FLIR installed, and {{both before and after the}} structural enhancement and repair were conducted on the skin and supporting structure in the aircraft`s right main wheel fairing. Inspection results and techniques developed to verify the aircraft`s structural integrity are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Measures {{to reclaim}} both the static {{strength}} and the fatigue life of plates with cracks are examined experimentally on 2024 aluminium alloy specimens. The simple measure of stop drilling the crack tips restored most of the tensile strength of the plate. To enhance the fatigue life of a cracked plate the process of stop drilling the crack tips, cold expanding the resulting holes and inserting interference-fit steel plugs has dramatically increased fatigue resistance. For the same spectrum fatigue life the stresses in the life-enhanced plates need to be 2. 6 times those in the plain cracked plates. This factor remains practically constant {{in the presence of}} secondary bending when the average bending-stress/axial-stress ratio is 0. 5. Surprisingly, the secondary bending reduced the fatigue life by only about 25 % for both unenhanced and enhanced specimens.
