40|$|Introduction: The article {{concerns}} {{occupational health}} and safety in agriculture of the Russian Federation. Among dangerous and harmful production factors in agriculture determining the injury rates and morbidity is negative impact of high levels of noise on workers. Prolonged exposure to noise leads to an increase in slow wave activity and changes in visual and auditory cortical response. Therefore, the improvement of conditions and labour protection in agriculture by reducing noise is an urgent task of our time. Materials and Methods: The authorsâ€™ assessment of the working conditions of employees of milk and meat processing industries showed that the noise level exceeds the standard values. There are some requirements for all the jobs. However, the development of noise-reducing structures demands frequency selective acoustic attenuation, based on the technological process. In the work, the author used methods based on features of the small reverberation chamber. Results: The authors proposed sound absorbent panels with high sanitary and hygienic properties: a biresonant honeycomb <b>soundproof</b> <b>panel</b> was developed for the dairy processing industry; an acoustic mesh panel was proposed for the meat processing lines. The sound absorption coefficient of the developed structures was evaluated by testing in a small reverberation chamber. Discussion and Conclusions: The article has an exploratory nature. The results of these studies graphically demonstrate the advantages of the proposed reduction of the noise level in agriculture...|$|E

Currently, to alleviate the road traffic noise damage, a demand for installation of soundproofing walls is rising. Among different shapes of soundproof walls being installed, the reflection-type acoustical insulation panel is highly drawing attentions of residents {{due to the fact that}} it does not obstruct their field of vision in contrast with the opaque acoustical insulation panel. On the other hand, improving the soundproofing wall of the reflection-type acoustical insulation barrier panel needs to be focused on since it has a possibility to cause a secondary damage by reflected sounds. Therefore, in this research, study has been carried out to improve the forms in order to minimize travelling of reflected sounds through changing the frontal surface shape and geometrical shape of the reflection-type <b>soundproofing</b> <b>panel.</b> A result from comparison between the normal reflection-type <b>soundproofing</b> <b>panel</b> and the improved <b>soundproofing</b> <b>panel,</b> with reduction effects in the noise reflection, showed that the curved type of <b>soundproofing</b> <b>panel</b> has an impact on reducing the noise up to 1. 5 dB. Furthermore, from the research conducted, it appears that the increase and decrease in the reflected sounds can be changeable depending on various design factors. Thus, it turns out that the study shows a potential possibility to develop a reduction technology of the reflected sound...|$|R
40|$|Shortage of site {{suitable}} for housing caused by rapid urban development {{has led to}} a construction of the high-rise apartment complex along the roadside. This gave rise to the increasing number of population exposed to the traffic noise. Nowadays, trans-parent noise barriers are used to replace the conventional noise barriers to solve the problems such as maintenance and urban land-scape. However, transparent noise barriers have also several problems such as discoloration, stains and scratching to lose initial advantages. In this study, it was focused to compare the soundproofing performance according to the type of polymer materials and panel structure to development of eco noise barrier. As a result, it was observed that PE and PP showed similar a soundproof performance with PC. And in case of <b>soundproofing</b> <b>panel</b> with double layer, sound insulation performance is improved abou...|$|R
50|$|The Soundproof Headboard - The contestants must install <b>soundproof</b> <b>panels</b> {{the size}} of a headboard. This {{involves}} precision mitre cuts for a frame as well as fitting fibreglass panelling between the frame panelling. Everyone cuts the mitre cuts incorrectly, and only Rob does not have any troubles with the stapler or adhesives used to attach the framing pieces to the wall. He passes easily. Dan fails due to the panels lacking internal supports (admitting that the entire headboard must be redone on his own time), while both Matt and Ajay build their framework too large; Matt gives up after this, but Ajay is able to complete the task by cutting the fibreglass into small chunks and building a patchwork panel. Charlene falls behind again, and only has a frame up with no panelling installed when time runs out.|$|R
50|$|When {{trying to}} find places to install <b>soundproofing,</b> {{acoustic}} <b>panels</b> should be installed in office areas where lots of traffic corridors, circulation pathways, and open work areas are connected. Successful acoustic panel installations rely on three strategies and techniques to absorb sound, block sound transmission {{from one place to}} another, and cover and masking of the sound.|$|R
40|$|The aim of our {{development}} is increasing the sound insulation abilities to maximum possible value. <b>Soundproofing</b> <b>panel</b> {{with a maximum}} soundproofing ability, protected by patent to Russia, pertains to technical protection facility against noise spreading by sound insulation that is to anti-noise panel. The most efficient is using such panels as filler structure for so named reverberated cameras, where {{it is necessary to}} provide frequentative reflection of the sound (that means big coefficient of the reflection and small coefficient of the sound transmission through filler structure). The technical result of the {{development is}} full minimization of coefficient of sound transmission through internal cavity, that leads to provision maximum possible soundproofing ability. Besides, expansion of the structured sound is prevented by the special design with the noncontact attachment point. Anti-noise panel with maximum sound insulation ability today is the most efficient soundproofing facility among such devices...|$|R
50|$|At {{the first}} {{basement}} level B1, {{there are seven}} meeting halls of a total area 509 m2 and total seating capacity of 488 people. The congress center's biggest meeting space with an area of 3028 m2 and 2,192 to 3,705-person seating capacity, the Harbiye Hall, occupies three levels. Its entrance is situated at level B2. The level B2 hosts another eight halls in sizes ranging between 87 - 1300 m2 with seating capacities from 104 to 1,404. Four of these halls are divisible {{in two or three}} smaller spaces by <b>soundproof</b> <b>panels.</b> The basement level B3 holds a total of 90 smaller rooms for workshop meetings in the range of 20 - 100 m2. The levels B4 and B5 are exhibition halls in the sizes of 4278 m2 and 5753 m2 with 4.00 m ceiling height as well as another bigger one of 6065 m2 with 7.20 m.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first episode}} was watched by 4.2 million [...] viewers but the initial {{reaction}} to the serial was far from positive. Critics were {{quick to point out}} various technical problems as well as the profanity now being screened before the watershed. As viewing figures plummeted, stabilising at around 1 million, the production team and writers started to iron out Brooksides teething troubles. <b>Soundproof</b> <b>panels</b> were placed on the ceilings of the houses to contain sound and eliminate echoing, and the scriptwriters toned down the language and removed a couple of poor performing supporting actors. The shows atmosphere changed with the arrival of new characters such as Alan Partridge (a character played by Dicken Ashworth and unrelated to the later comedy character of the same name) who moved into the bungalow (number 6) in April 1983, while pensioners Harry (Bill Dean) and Edna (Betty Alberge) Cross, who bought number 7, arrived in November. Their opening storyline involved the mysterious movement of their garden gnomes. These new characters expanded the cast whilst helping to bring humour and balance to the existing cast during 1983.|$|R
50|$|Automotive {{soundproofing}} aims {{to decrease}} or eliminate {{the effects of}} exterior noise, primarily engine, exhaust and tire noise across a wide frequency range. When constructing a vehicle which includes <b>soundproofing,</b> a <b>panel</b> dampening material is fitted which reduces the vibration of the vehicles body panels when they are excited {{by one of the}} many high energy sound sources caused when the vehicle is in use. There are many complex noises created within vehicles which change with the driving environment and speed at which the vehicle travels. Significant noise reductions of up to 8 dB can be achieved by installing a combination of different types of materials.|$|R
40|$|Today with rapid {{industrial}}ization, {{industrial noise}} {{has become a}} serious environmental problem in Sri Lanka. The noise which is generated by machines in industry is called as industrial noise. This excessive noise can interfere with communication between supervisors and employees. Continuous exposure to noise can cause fatigue, which often results in accidents and reduces the pace and quality of work. Noise affects negatively on the day today life of surrounding people, who have faced with many problems mentally and physically. Therefore, noise control {{is one of the}} major requirements to improve the living environment. Most of the developed countries use practical techniques to minimize the nuisance such as barrier walls, duct silencers, acoustical wall <b>panel,</b> <b>soundproof</b> curtains, sound enclosures for industrial machinery and other similar noise control treatments that are installed near the source to effectively reduce the sound level. However, Sri Lanka has not yet yielded much into this issue as noise reduction methods are costly. Therefore, it is necessary to find out cost effective methods to control industrial noise. This research was conducted to investigate the potential uses of Salvinia dust as natural sound reduction material, to give a solution for the existing industrial noise problems. Specimens having a size of 75 mm (diameter) x 25 mm (thickness) were made by using Salvinia dust. Salvinia dust was mixed with cement at a ratio of 1 : 1 and water was added. Noise Reduction Coefficient of these specimens were investigated by using an experimental set-up including signal generator, speaker and noise level meter. Noise reduction ability of the materials was quantified by using Noise Reduction Co-efficient (NRC). Variation of NRC with particle size, mix proportion and sample thickness were also investigated. Effectiveness of Salvinia dust to control industrial noise is discussed in this paper...|$|R
