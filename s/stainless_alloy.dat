40|$|A {{number of}} passive film growth {{models have been}} {{advanced}} in the past, each founded on different assumptions and providing different rate laws. A new, generalized growth model has been developed and the numerical simulation of the transient behavior of oxide film growth on metals and alloys is reported here. This model {{is based on the}} transport of anions and cations (in a Cr 2 O 3 film for <b>stainless</b> <b>alloy).</b> In contrast to most models up to date, it describes the time-variant behavior of film and film/solution potential differences. Because these potential differences are expressed as exponential functions of film thickness, asymptotic behaviors can be studied and it is shown that a square root law results for very thin and very thick films. Growth rate for intermediate films and during transient periods, on the other hand, is determined by numerical integration. Parameters which were introduced by the model and whose values are unknown are conveniently regrouped into only four lumped parameters, which are easily estimated by numerical optimisation. It is shown that experimental oxide film thickness measurements on stainless alloys in high-temperature aqueous environments can be reproduced. It is further shown that the diffusional rate expressions of all the species contributing to growth are analogous, explaining why it is possible to fit growth kinetics with a single type of point defect...|$|E
40|$|In February of 1999, a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) was {{undertaken}} between Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Special Metals Corporation - Huntington Alloys (formerly INCO Alloys International, Inc.) {{to develop a}} modified wrought austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>alloy</b> with considerably more strength and corrosion resistance than alloy 800 H or 800 HT, but with otherwise similar engineering and application characteristics. Alloy 800 H and related alloys have extensive use in coal flue gas environments, {{as well as for}} tubing or structural components in chemical and petrochemical applications. The main concept of the project was make small, deliberate elemental microalloying additions to this Fe-based alloy to produce, with proper processing, fine stable carbide dispersions for enhanced high temperature creep-strength and rupture resistance, with similar or better oxidation/corrosion resistance. The project began with alloy 803, a Fe- 25 Cr- 35 NiTi,Nb alloy recently developed by INCO, as the base alloy for modification. Smaller commercial developmental alloy heats were produced by Special Metal. At the end of the project, three rounds of alloy development had produced a modified 803 alloy with significantly better creep resistance above 815 C (1500 C) than standard alloy 803 in the solution-annealed (SA) condition. The new upgraded 803 alloy also had the potential for a processing boost in that creep resistance for certain kinds of manufactured components that was not found in the standard alloy. The upgraded 803 alloy showed similar or slightly better oxidation and corrosion resistance relative to standard 803. Creep strength and oxidation/corrosion resistance of the upgraded 803 alloy were significantly better than found in alloy 800 H, as originally intended. The CRADA was terminated in February 2003. A contributing factor was Special Metals Corporation being in Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. Additional testing, further commercial scale-up, and any potential invention disclosures were not pursued...|$|E
40|$|The {{temperatures}} and concentrated chloride environments involved in potash milling provide conditions for high susceptibility to localized corrosion. This must be countered with careful material selection that provides adequate protection at affordable cost. Indexes have been formulated {{to take into}} account the effect of the elemental composition of a passive alloy on the resistance of the alloy to localized corrosion. A very comprehensive index, the Localized Corrosion Resistance Index (LCRI), is studied by this thesis and is evaluated for its accuracy in ranking stainless alloys. The LCRI, Cr%+ 3. 3 (Mo%) - 0. 33 (Ni%) + 16 (N%), takes advantage of the readily available weight percentages of chromium, molybdenum, nickel, and nitrogen. This thesis examined the theories behind pitting and crevice corrosion and the effect these elements have on the passive layers protecting the surface of a <b>stainless</b> <b>alloy.</b> Electrochemical experiments were performed on selected alloys in laboratory conditions, a pilot plant flow loop, and in potash mill conditions. The data obtained for this thesis supported the use of the LCRI as a ranking index for austenitic and duplex stainless steels. Ferritic and cast austenitic steels had less resistance to localized corrosion than the LCRI indicated. Totally different indexes or radical correction factors would be required to allow comparison of all types of alloys. A separate and extensive study could eventually achieve this. Temperature effects were examined to determine if the ability to accurately rank alloys with the LCRI could be compromised. The experiments tracked the pitting resistance of the alloys over a temperature range of 20 - 100 °C, covering conditions found in potash mills. The results found the LCRI reliable over the whole range of temperatures. Chromium, molybdenum, nickel, and nitrogen factors in the LCRI were studied, each in tum, to evaluate their worth in predicting the localized corrosion behavior of passive alloys. The data supported the theories regarding the effect of each element on the passive layer protecting the surface of the alloys. A new index was formulated to better fit the experimental data. The formula Cr%+ 4. 1 (Mo%) 0. 14 (Ni%) + 6 (N%) indicates molybdenum had a more pronounced effect on corrosion resistance while nitrogen's beneficial effect and nickel's detrimental effect were less pronounced. This formula, denoted LCRIll, offers better accuracy than the more conventional LCRI...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research work was to develop new Fe-Mn-Si based shape memory alloys with property and cost advantages over existing commercial Fe-Mn-Si and Fe- Mn-Si-Cr-Ni alloys. The work involved {{the investigation of the}} effect of alloying elements, heat treatment and precipitation on the shape memory effect and corrosion resistance of candidate alloys. The mechanism of stress induced →ε martensitic transformation and its reverse transformation, and the effect of thermomechanical training on the shape memory effect were systematically studied. TEM observations supported the concept that the regular overlapping of stacking faults can result in the formation of bulk e martensite plates. Stacking faults were also found to exist in e martensite plates, and it is inferred that these faults can act as embryos for ε→ reverse transformation. It was found that the shape memory capacity of Fe-Mn-Si based shape memory alloys varies with annealing temperature, and this effect can be explained in terms of the effect of annealing on ↔ε transformation. Annealing at about 873 K was found to be optimal to form the dislocation structures which are favourable for stress induced martensitic transformation, thus resulting in the best shape memory behaviour. Strengthening of the austenite matrix is generally considered to be an effective method for improving the shape memory effect of ferrous shape memory alloys, and although ausaging has been found to improve transformation reversibility and shape memory effect in Fe-Ni based alloys, precipitation of coherent Ni 3 Ti particles in austenite was found in the present work to degrade the shape memory effect of Fe-Mn-Si based shape memory alloys. TEM results showed that precipitates can pin Shockley partial dislocations, suppressing stress induced →ε transformation. Optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction results confirmed that the amount of stress induced e martensite decreased when precipitation occurred. It was found that alloying Fe-Mn-Si ternary alloys with Al and Cu significantly enhanced their resistance to hydrochloric acid attack. For example, Fe- 28 Mn- 6 Si-lAl- 1 Cu and Fe- 20 Mn- 6 Si- 7 Cr-lCu (wt%) alloys developed in the work exhibited both good shape memory effect and corrosion resistance to hydrochloric acid. Furthermore, Fe-Mn-Si-Cr-Ni-Cu corrosion resistant alloys developed on the basis of conventional Fe-Mn-Si-Cr-Ni stainless steel alloys exhibited improved and increasing resistance to hydrochloric acid corrosion with increasing Cu content. The new Fe-Mn-Si-Al-Cu and Fe-Mn-Si-Cr-Ni-Cu alloys also showed better corrosion resistance than their conventional counterparts in sulphuric acid. Immersion tests in 3. 5 % NaCl solution showed that Cu did not significantly improve the corrosion resistance. Among the alloys examined, the reference Fe-Mn-Si-Cr-Ni alloy gave the best corrosion resistance in 3. 5 % NaCl solution. However, the corrosion resistance of Fe-Mn-Si-Cr- Cu alloys in 3. 5 % NaCl was relatively high and increased with increasing Cr concentration. Potentiostatic tests on Fe-Mn-Si-Cr-Ni and Fe-Mn-Si-Cr-Ni-Cu alloys indicated that the addition of Cu is beneficial in facilitating passivation. The shape memory effect of the alloys investigated was significantly improved by thermomechanical training, with the efficiency of training being a function of the number of training cycles, the training strain, and the recovery annealing temperature. Generally, the shape memory effect increased with increasing training cycle number, and reached a saturation value after 4 to 6 training cycles. The optimal training strain was found to depend on the alloy composition. An excessive training strain induces slip deformation which does not contribute to the recovery strain. The recovery annealing temperature was found to be crucial to the thermomechanical training, and the current study indicated that annealing at about 873 K was most effective for improving the shape memory effect. Thermomechanical training makes stress induced martensitic transformation easier, because the training process creates dislocation structures which promote the nucleation of martensite. Training resulted in a finer martensite plate size, reducing the local transformation shear and volume strains which need to be accommodated in the austenite. Thermomechanical training also influenced ε→ reverse transformation, with the Af temperature decreasing with number of training cycles. In contrast, the Ms and As temperatures remained nearly constant. Therefore, the improvement of shape memory effect on training is due to the facilitation of both stress induced martensitic transformation and its reverse transformation. Several of the new alloys, and particularly those based on Fe-Mn-Si-Cr-Cu, showed excellent strain recovery after training. Recovery strains of up to 5. 4 % were obtained, significantly higher than those obtained for the Fe-Mn-Si and Fe-Mn-Si-Cr-Ni reference alloys and higher than strains previously reported in the literature for Fe-Mn- Si based alloys. The corrosion resistance of the Fe-Mn-Si-Cr-Cu alloys was also {{similar to that of the}} commercial <b>stainless</b> <b>alloy</b> (Fe-Mn-Si-Cr-Ni) and because of the replacement of up to 10 wt% Ni with lwt%Cu, the new alloys are much less expensive...|$|E
