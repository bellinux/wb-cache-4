50|$|Finally, another {{widespread}} {{application of}} subcooling is boosting and economising. Inversely to superheating, subcooling, or {{the amount of}} heat withdrawn from the liquid refrigerant on the subcooling process, manifests itself as an increase on the refrigeration capacity of the system. This means that any extra heat removal after the condensation (subcooling) allows a higher ratio of heat absorption on further stages of the cycle. It is to be noted that superheating has exactly the inverse effect, and that an internal heat exchanger alone, {{is not able to}} increase the capacity of the system because the boosting effect of subcooling is dimmed by the superheating, making the net capacity gain equal to zero. Nevertheless, some systems are able to move refrigerant and/or to remove heat using up less energy because they do so on high pressure fluids that later cool or <b>subcool</b> lower pressure (which are more difficult to cool) fluids.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{boosting}} and economizing, it {{is possible}} to produce cascade subcooling systems, able to <b>subcool</b> the liquid with an analogous and separate system. This procedure is complex and costly as it involves the use of a complete system (with compressors and all of the gear) only for subcooling. Still, the idea has raised some investigation as there are some purported benefits. Furthermore, the United States Department of Energy issued a Federal Technology Alert mentioning refrigerant subcooling as a reliable way of improving the performance of systems and saving energy. Making this kind of system operationally independent from the main system and commercially possible is subject to study due to the mentioned claims. The separation of the subcooling unit from the main cycle (in terms of design) is not known to be an economically viable alternative. This kind of system usually requires the use of expensive electronic control systems to monitor the fluid thermodynamic conditions. Recently, a product capable of increasing the system's capacity by adding mechanical subcooling to any generic unspecific refrigeration system has been developed in Chile.|$|E
50|$|Natural <b>subcooling</b> is {{the name}} {{normally}} given to the temperature drop produced inside the condenser (condenser <b>subcooling),</b> combined with the temperature drop happening through the pipeline alone, excluding any heat exchangers of any kind. When there is no mechanical <b>subcooling</b> (i.e. an internal heat exchanger), natural <b>subcooling</b> should equal total <b>subcooling.</b> On the other hand, mechanical <b>subcooling</b> is the temperature reduced by any artificial process that is deliberately placed to create <b>subcooling.</b> This concept refers mainly to devices such as internal heat exchangers, independent <b>subcooling</b> cascades, economisers or boosters.|$|R

50|$|Condenser <b>subcooling</b> {{differs from}} total <b>subcooling</b> usually because after the condenser, {{throughout}} the piping, the refrigerant may naturally tend to cool even more, before it arrives {{to the expansion}} valve, {{but also because of}} artificial <b>subcooling.</b> The total <b>subcooling</b> is the complete temperature drop the refrigerant undergoes from its actual condensing temperature, to the concrete temperature it has when reaching the expansion valve: this is the effective <b>subcooling.</b>|$|R
30|$|In field practice, {{the liquid}} level cannot be {{directly}} measured from surface. Instead, temperature gauges are installed {{along the length}} of the producer well to measure the temperature difference between the fluid exiting the upper injector and entering the lower producer. This temperature difference is referred to as <b>subcool</b> and serves as a surrogate variable for liquid level height (Wilson 2015). The smaller the interwell <b>subcool</b> difference, the closer the produced liquids are to the steam temperature, and thus the smaller the height of the liquid pool (Gotawala and Gates 2012). However, <b>subcool</b> is not constant {{along the length of}} the production lateral; there is localized variability in <b>subcool.</b> Moreover, flow capacity of the wellbore is large compared to that of the reservoir in the same direction, making compensating steam movement in the reservoir difficult (Vander Valk and Yang 2007). Furthermore, local liquid levels cannot effectively drain parallel to the well due to the very low drainage angles (Edmunds 2013). Too low an average <b>subcool</b> and steam breakthrough will occur at points along the producing lateral, negatively impacting cumulative steam to oil ratio (cSOR), thermal efficiency, and the economics of the project. Too large an average <b>subcool</b> and liquid occupies a significant fraction of the steam chamber, preventing the free movement of steam to the chamber boundaries and potentially flooding the injector well itself (Banerjee et al. 2013 b; Carpenter 2015; Gotawala and Gates 2012). Flow control devices (FCDs) are used to overcome the problems with uneven steam trap height, allowing for more aggressive production rates and less manipulation of <b>subcool.</b>|$|E
40|$|A system {{alternative}} to pressurization for providing net positive suction pressure (NPSP) {{to the main}} engine of a low-thrust cryogenic stage has been conceptually designed and analyzed.

This paper presents an experimental study on subcooling and nucleation in paraffin-in-water emulsions. Different material systems with the average dropletsize from 0. 2 to 12. 5 Mym were prepared and analyzed. An increased subcooling up to 15 K was observed for small droplets. The paraffin, surfactant and nucleating agent also have impacts on the subcooling. The nucleation theory and {{the evaluation of the}} experimental results will be presented in Part 2...|$|E
50|$|The <b>subcooling</b> {{process can}} happen in many {{different}} ways; therefore, {{it is possible to}} distinguish between the different parts in which the process takes places. Normally, <b>subcooling</b> refers to the magnitude of the temperature drop which is easily measurable, but it is possible to speak of <b>subcooling</b> in terms of the total heat being removed. The most commonly known <b>subcooling</b> is the condenser <b>subcooling,</b> which is usually known as the total temperature drop that takes place inside the condenser, immediately after the fluid has totally condensed, until it leaves the condensing unit.|$|R

The liquid <b>subcooling</b> was varied from 2 to 20 K. As a result, the average heat flux increases with an increase in liquid <b>subcooling.</b> The film boiling heat transfer was enhanced by 15 to 220 % with an increase in liquid <b>subcooling.</b> The minimum heat flux increases linearly with liquid <b>subcooling...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The term <b>subcooling</b> {{refers to}} a liquid {{existing}} at a temperature below its normal boiling point.

40|$|Abstract- A charge level {{detecting}} device in residential and light commercial heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems and in refrigeration systems {{is used to}} detect the sufficiency of refrigerant or charge level whether it is proper or not. The most common problems affecting residential and commercial HVAC/R systems are slow refrigerant leaks, improper refrigerant charge and charging device. The usual methods for charge level detection are sight glass method and system high side and low side pressure measurement method. The limitation of sight glass method is it works only if a predictable amount of refrigerant remains {{in one part of}} system or constant flow of refrigerant is maintained throughout the system. Pressure of any HVAC/R system cannot be measured in a running system, and charge leaks occur in case of pressure method. Refrigerant charge level {{detecting device}} employs a method of determining if the refrigerant charge is within an acceptable range, including the steps of measuring the superheat and <b>subcool</b> temperatures at compressor inlet and condenser outlet. Actual superheat and actual subcooling values are calculated and these values are thus compared with target superheat and target <b>subcool</b> values in microcontroller device, thus obtained from manufacturers chart for particular type of refrigerant, which values depends on outdoor dry bulb temperature and indoor wet bulb temperature on system operating situation and shows the charge status result. The refrigerant charge indicator is {{based on the fact that}} when refrigerant starts to leak, the evaporator coil temperature starts to drop and the level of liquid sub cooling drops. An over charge in this system results in compressor flooding, damaging to the motor and mechanical components. Inadequate refrigerant charge can lead to increased power consumption, thus reducing system capacity and efficiency...|$|E

40|$|When {{a liquid}} starts to solidify only when cooled well below its melting temperature, {{this is called}} <b>subcooling.</b> From {{nucleation}} theory, <b>subcooling</b> {{is expected to increase}} for small volumes due to statistics and seed isolation effects. PCM emulsions are superior in their heat transfer rates compared to larger PCM modules. In principle, the smaller the droplets, the larger is the risk for significant <b>subcooling.</b> Due to the limitations of theoretic models, it is necessary to use experimental investigations to predict from what droplet size on <b>subcooling</b> becomes problematic in a PCM. In this paper, we present an experimental study on <b>subcooling</b> in hexadecane emulsions. Different hexadecane-water-surfactant systems with droplet size in the range of about 0. 1 - 20 m were prepared and analyzed.

40|$|The {{difference}} in effect of <b>subcooling</b> in a condenser (non-designated area, NDA) vs. in a <b>subcooler</b> (designated {{area of the}} same condenser, DA) on the system performance is experimentally analyzed in a vehicular air conditioning system operating with R 134 a and R 1234 yf. With {{a unique set of}} microchannel condensers, an experimental comparison between <b>subcooling</b> generated in non-designated area (NDA) and designated area (DA) of the condenser showed that both configurations yielded similar values of maximum COP improvement within the operating conditions considered. The results suggested that the way condenser <b>subcooling</b> is achieved, either in a DA or a NDA, may not be important in terms of COP. The experimental results for non-designated <b>subcooling</b> indicated that the larger the air-refrigerant temperature {{difference in}} the condenser, due to a large cooling capacity needed for a given condenser size, the higher the COP maximizing <b>subcooling</b> and the maximum COP improvement from condenser <b>subcooling.</b> For R 1234 yf, as the temperature difference in the condenser increased from 12 °C to 28 °C, the COP maximizing <b>subcooling</b> increased from 6 °C to 16 °C and the COP gains, from 6 % to 44 %. Experimental and numerical results also demonstrated that condensers with a higher air-refrigerant temperature difference in the condenser would require a larger COP maximizing area ratio allocated for <b>subcooling.</b> Nevertheless, a fixed designated area yielded near maximum COPs within a reasonable range of operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Boiling {{two-phase}} flow {{is found in}} many industrial applications such as boiling water reactors, {{two-phase flow}} heat exchangers and refrigeration systems. The physics of two-phase gas-liquid flow may lead to undesirable system instabilities, and in the literature density wave oscillations (DWO) {{is reported to be}} the most commonly observed instability phenomenon. However, the literature alsoprovides two opposing views on what the fundamental mechanism of DWO is. The so-called classical description of DWO focuses on the variation in mixture density as the governing mechanism, and the oscillation period will consequently be about one to two times the channel residence time. The findings presented in citet{Rizwan-Uddin 1994 } show that it is the variation in mixture velocity that hasthe dominating effect, and the oscillation period was reported to be closer to four times the channel residence time. citet{Ambrosini 2000 } united the two opposing views by stating that the governing mechanismdepends on the level of system <b>subcooling.</b> The classical description of DWO is based on a lower level of <b>subcooling,</b> while citet{Rizwan-Uddin 1994 } considered higher <b>subcooling.</b> Here, the fundamental mechanisms of DWO and the effect of system <b>subcooling</b> is investigated further by performing a numerical analysis using a one dimensional homogenous equilibrium flow model. The modeled system consists of a horizontal uniformlyheated boiling channel with an inlet- and exit restriction. The system is exposed to constant externally imposed pressure drop. The effect of system <b>subcooling</b> is investigated by comparing the self-sustained periodicoscillations which make out the modeled stability threshold. The flow model is validated by observing the above mentioned effects of <b>subcooling</b> on DWO. Further, it is found that the change from a density dominated exit restriction towards a velocity dominated exit restriction is a smooth transition for increased <b>subcooling.</b> The amplitude of the variations in exit mixture velocity increases continuously with <b>subcooling,</b> anddue to the squared relationship between the exit restriction pressure drop and the exit mixture velocity, velocity becomes the governing mechanism at high <b>subcooling.</b> The modeled stability threshold approaches a straight line at high <b>subcooling.</b> This line represents operating conditions which have the same mean boiling boundary location. However, the amplitude of the variations about this mean limit grows exponentially at high <b>subcooling.</b> The oscillation period of the observed DWO grows continuously with higher <b>subcooling,</b> and the period increases exponentially at high <b>subcooling.</b> In contrast, the mean boiling channel residence time approaches an upper mean limit at high <b>subcooling.</b> It is postulated that it is the transition towards a more mixture velocity dominated system that causes the oscillation period to evolve as it does with respect to the level of <b>subcooling...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{thermoelectric}} (TE) subcooler {{was designed}} and fabricated to <b>subcool</b> CO 2 exiting a gas cooler of a transcritical vapor compression cycle test system. The thermoelectric modules operated at efficiencies greater than the baseline system, increasing capacity and the overall coefficient of performance (COP) of the entire system. Subcooling of the CO 2 before the expansion device led to a reduced optimum high side pressure, resulting in greater COP improvement that cannot be achieved in conventional refrigerant vapor compression systems utilizing a TE Subcooler. Improvements in COP of 10 % were demonstrated with a corresponding capacity increase of 13 %. A capacity increase of 24 % was demonstrated at a comparable COP as the baseline system.

40|$|This study {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} circulation composition in a heat pump cycle for considering the effect of its difference from the charged composition on the cycle performance prediction. The experiment was conducted with a vapor compression heat pump cycle using a compressor developed for R 410 A.

The system supplies heating and cooling demands to two greenhouses with temperature ranging 308 similar to 323 K and 273 similar to 291 K respectively and utilizes an ice storage tank to <b>subcool</b> the condensed refrigerant, which can enhance the system coefficient of performance (COP). The ice storage tank charges for storing ice, when the cooling load {{is less than the}} nominal cooling capacity. While the cooling load is larger than the nominal cooling capacity, the ice storage tank discharges for subcooling. The results show that in the charge mode the heat pump COP of ice storage system is 12 % higher than that without ice storage tank.

40|$|The {{calculations}} done to size {{the control}} dewar <b>subcooler</b> were done {{to obtain a}} sufficient <b>subcooler</b> size based on some conservative assumptions. The final <b>subcooler</b> design proposed in the design report will work even better because (1) It has more tubing length, and (2) will have already <b>subcooled</b> liquid at the inlet due to the transfer line design. The <b>subcooler</b> design described in the 'Design Report of the 2 Tesla Superconducting Solenoid for the Fermilab D 0 Detector Upgrade' is the final design proposed. A short description of this design follows. The <b>subcooler</b> is constructed of 0. 50 -inch OD copper tubing with 1. 0 -inch diameter fins. It has ten and one half spirals at a 11. 375 -inch centerline diameter to provide 31 feet of tubing length. The liquid helium supply for the solenoid flows through the <b>subcooler</b> and then is expanded through a J-T valve. The <b>subcooler</b> spirals are immersed in the return two phase helium process stream. The return stream is directed over the finned tubing by an annulus created by a 10 -inch pipe inside a 12 -inch pipe. The transfer line from the refrigerator to the control dewar is constructed such that the liquid helium supply tube is in the refrigerator return stream, thereby <b>subcooling</b> the liquid {{up to the point}} where the u-tubes connect the transfer line to the control dewar. The <b>subcooler</b> within the control dewar will remove the heat picked up in the helium supply u-tube/bayonets. The attached subcooler/heat exchanger calculations were done neglecting any <b>subcooling</b> in the transfer line. All heat picked up in the transfer line from the refrigerator storage dewar to the control dewar is absorbed by the supply stream. The <b>subcooler</b> was sized such that the two phase supply fluid is <b>subcooled</b> at 1. 7 atm pressure and when expanded through a JT valve to 1. 45 atm pressure it is at a saturated liquid state. The calculations apply during steady state operation and at a flow rate of 16 g/s. The analysis of the heat exchanger was broken into two parts relating to the heat transfer mode taking place. The first part is considered the condensing part in which the helium supply stream is changed from two phase fluid to one phase liquid. The second part is the <b>subcooling</b> part where the liquid temperature is lowered, i. e [...] <b>subcooled.</b> A summary of the calculations and results appears on the next page.

50|$|Another {{important}} and very common application of <b>subcooling</b> is its indirect {{use on the}} superheating process. Superheating is analogous to <b>subcooling</b> in an operative way, and both processes can be coupled using an internal heat exchanger. <b>Subcooling</b> here serves itself from the superheating and vice versa, allowing heat to flow from the refrigerant at a higher pressure (liquid), to the one with lower pressure (gas). This creates an energetic equivalence between the <b>subcooling</b> and the superheating phenomena {{when there is no}} energy loss. Normally, the fluid that is being <b>subcooled</b> is hotter than the refrigerant that is being superheated, allowing an energy flux in the needed direction. Superheating is critical for the operation of compressors because a system lacking it may provide the compressor with a liquid gas mixture, situation that generally leads to the destruction of the gas compressor because liquid is uncompressible. This makes <b>subcooling</b> an easy and widespread source of heat for the superheating process.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented {{that explains the}} variation of superheat with <b>subcooling</b> that has been observed {{by a number of}} researchers investigating nucleate boiling heat transfer at constant heat flux. It is shown that superheat initially increases with increasing <b>subcooling</b> near saturated conditions because {{of the way in which}} changes in active site density and average bubble frequency with increasing <b>subcooling</b> affect the rate of heat removal from the heater surface by enthalpy transport and microlayer evaporation. As <b>subcooling</b> increases further, natural convection begins to play an increasingly important role in the heat transfer process. Ultimately, natural convection is able to accommodate the entire imposed heat flux, after which superheat decreases as <b>subcooling</b> increases. The success of the analysis in explaining the variation of superheat with <b>subcooling</b> suggests that the rate of the heat removal from the heater surface is completely determined by the mechanisms of enthalpy transport, natural convection, and microlayer evaporation...|$|R

The study results show that as low-grade cooling capacity from the AS is provided to the CS, high-grade cooling capacity increases, compressor power consumption decreases, and the COP of the CS therefore increases.

40|$|A {{concept for}} {{improving}} the performance of propulsion systems in expendable and single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) launch vehicles much like the X 33 /RLV has been identified. The approach is to utilize densified cryogenic liquid hydrogen (LH 2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) propellants to fuel the propulsion stage. The primary benefit for using this relatively high specific impulse densified propellant mixture is the subsequent reduction of the launch vehicle gross lift-off weight.

40|$|Cryogenic Hydrogen Radiation Shielding (CHRS) is {{the most}} mass {{efficient}} material radiation shielding strategy for human spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). Future human space flight, mission beyond LEO could exceed one year in duration.

40|$|Abstract: For thermal {{technologies}} for heavy oil and oil sand reservoir extraction, such as cyclic steam stimulation and steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), suboptimal steam conformance leads to recovery factors between 25 - 50 %. Although preliminary research using Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control in SAGD operations has proved beneficial towards steam conformance, PID control is responsive only to deviation from set-points and lacks constraint-handling capabilities. This results in suboptimal actuation signals that are sometimes unattainable. This paper summarizes research on a Model-Predictive-Controller (MPC) with proactive adjustments of steam injection rate. The steam injection rate was determined based on recursive parameter updates of a suitable time varying dynamic model describing the implicit {{relationship between the}} <b>subcool</b> temperature difference and the input heat rate, to achieve optimal steam conformance. Furthermore, the steam injection rate was constrained such that the pressure with which the steam impinged on the formation, called well bottom hole pressure (BHP), was below the formation fracture pressure of 4500 kPa at all times. The real time control study {{was made possible by}} establishing a bidirectional communication link between the Computer Modelling Group (CMG) STARSTM, and MATLAB/Simulink software. The three-dimensional heterogeneous reservoir model, developed in STARSTM acted as a virtual plant and the MPC, developed in MATLAB/Simulink, acted as an onsite controller.

40|$|Integrated Thermal Energy Storage (ITES) {{is a novel}} {{concept in}} {{improving}} cooling performance of air-conditioning systems at peak-load conditions. In contrast to conventional chilled-water or ice storage, it uses stored chilled water to <b>subcool</b> condenser refrigerant liquid instead of supplying cooling directly to a cooling load. Â For typical R- 134 a and R- 410 A systems, subcooling increases capacity by approximately. 5 to. 7 %/Â°F (~. 9 to 1. 3 %/K) without increasing compressor input power. Even larger performance improvements are possible with transcritical carbon dioxide systems. Â The subcooler is preferably a high-effectiveness, counterflow heat exchanger with approximately equal temperature change on both the water and refrigerant sides. This configuration allows warm water {{to return to the}} tank at a temperature that approaches the entering refrigerant liquid temperature. For air-cooled systems the water temperature change can be 60 to 80 Â°F (33 to 44 K) or even greater. The large temperature change greatly reduces the required tank size compared to conventional chilled-water storage, which is typically limited to a temperature change of about 10 to 20 Â°F (5 to 11 K). The high temperatures of warm water in the tank combined with lower nighttime air temperatures reduce energy required to cool the tank and improve overall system efficiency in addition to providing a large reduction in peak electric demand. Â Laboratory demonstration with a nominal 30 -ton (105 kW) air-cooled scroll chiller confirmed large performance improvements during subcooler operation. Â At an ambient temperature of 115 Â°F (46 Â°C), the measured cooling capacity increased almost 50 % with a slight reduction in compressor input power...|$|E
40|$|The initial {{thickness}} of methane hydrate film was directly measured by suspending a single methane bubble in water at 274. 0, 276. 0, and 278. 0 K. The {{results show that}} the initial hydrate film thickness decreases from tens of micrometers to about 10 3 ̆bcm with the <b>subcooling</b> increased from 0. 5 K to about 3 K. When <b>subcooling</b> is higher than 1. 0 K, all initial film thickness data measured under different temperatures vary inversely with the <b>subcooling.</b> Notable three-dimensional growths of hydrate crystals of different sizes and shapes at film front and emergence of new crystal were clearly observed at lower <b>subcooling</b> that resulting in the rougher surface of hydrate film and uncertainty of initial thickness measurement under lower <b>subcooling.</b> The hydrate film growth was dominated by film growth in thickness, not by lateral growth at low <b>subcooling.</b> The growth in {{thickness of}} hydrate shell covering one whole bubble surface was also investigated. 9 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).

40|$|Experiments on {{the film}} boiling heat {{transfer}} from a horizontal circular plate facing downward to <b>subcooled</b> water at atmospheric pressure have been carried for saturated and <b>subcooled</b> conditions. Correlation equations have been obtained for saturated boiling heat transfer and a modified dimensionless parameter of heat transfer has been proposed for <b>subcooled</b> liquids, which can effectively correlate within ± 20 % the experimental data obtained under the steady-state condition and the quenching method...|$|R
50|$|The <b>subcooling</b> {{principle}} {{behind all}} these applications {{is the fact}} that, in terms of heat transfer, all the <b>subcooling</b> is directly added to the cooling capacity of the refrigerant (as superheating would be directly deducted). As compressors that are <b>subcooling</b> work on this easier conditions, higher pressure makes their refrigerant cycles more efficient, and the heat withdrawn by this means, cheaper than the one withdrawn by the main system, in terms of energy.|$|R
