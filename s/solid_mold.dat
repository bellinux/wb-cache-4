Other problems for airless heavy equipment tires include dissipating the heat buildup {{that occurs when}} they are driven. Airless tires are often filled with compressed polymers (plastic), rather than air or can be a <b>solid</b> <b>molded</b> product.|$|R
50|$|Soluble fillers, e.g. solid sodium {{chloride}} crystals mixed into a liquid urethane system, {{which is then}} shaped into a solid polymer part, the {{sodium chloride}} is later washed out by immersing the <b>solid</b> <b>molded</b> part in water for some time, to leave small inter-connected holes in relatively high density polymer products, (e.g. Porvair synthetic leather materials for shoe uppers).|$|R
50|$|A metal mold, or former, {{placed on}} the back of the wood while heat bending can help ensure that all the bends and curves are done to the {{requirements}} of the project being made. Steel or iron are usually avoided, as iron can react with moist timber to produce rust staining, or some tannin-rich woods such as oak or chestnut will provide indelible blue-black iron tannates. After heat bending the wood, clamping the wood into a <b>solid</b> <b>mold</b> will reinforce the bends made to the wood while drying, preventing the wood from straightening while it dries.|$|E
30|$|The use of (Lagrangian) {{variables}} indexed by a {{coordinate system}} {{attached to the}} particle enables the numerical method to handle arbitrary large movement of the material freely moving surfaces or interfaces. The modeling of a NIL, {{as well as any}} other mold filling problem, is complicated by the presence of dynamic movement of the contact line between the melt and stamp during filling. It is therefore essential to apply an easy handling of this. Here, we treat the contact of the particles as follows: the time and position of the contact to a solid surface of the particles in nodal points (in the finite element discretization) was calculated with an explicit second order prediction. Any particle (e.g., node point) is then attached (e.g., sticking) to the <b>solid</b> <b>mold,</b> starting from the time (and position) of contact.|$|E

50|$|Because PGPR {{improves}} the flow characteristics of chocolate and compound chocolate, especially near the melting point, it {{can improve the}} efficiency of chocolate coating processes: chocolate coatings with PGPR flow better around shapes of enrobed and dipped products, and it also {{improves the}} performance of equipment used to produce <b>solid</b> <b>molded</b> products: the chocolate flows better into the mold, and surrounds inclusions and releases trapped air more easily. PGPR {{can also be used}} to reduce the quantity of cocoa butter needed in chocolate formulations: the solid particles in chocolate are suspended in the cocoa butter, and by reducing the viscosity of the chocolate, less cocoa butter is required, which saves costs, because cocoa butter is an expensive ingredient, and also leads to a lower-fat product.|$|R

40|$|With {{the rising}} tide of {{antibiotic}} resistant bacteria, extending the longevity of the current antibiotic arsenal is becoming a necessity. Developing local, controlled release antibiotic strategies, particularly for difficult to penetrate tissues such as bone, may prove to be a better alternative. Previous efforts to develop an osteoconductive local antibiotic release device for bone were created as <b>solid</b> <b>molded</b> composites; however, intimate contact with host bone was found to be critical to support host bone regrowth; thus, an osteocondconductive antibiotic releasing bone void filling putty was developed. Furthermore, a controlled releasing polymer matrix was refined using pendant-functionalized diols to provide tailorable pharmacokinetics. In vitro pharmacokinetic and bioactivity profiles were compared for a putty formulation with an analogous composition as its molded counterpart as well as four new pendant-functionalized polymers. A best-fit analysis of polymer composition in either small cylindrical disks or larger spheres revealed that the new pendant-functionalized polymers appear to release vancomycin via both diffusion and erosion regardless of the geometry of the putty. In silico simulations, a valuable technique for diffusion mediated controlled release models, will be used to confirm and optimize this property...|$|R
50|$|As {{barium sulfate}} has high burning point and is {{insoluble}} in water, {{it is used}} as a coating material in casting of copper anode plates. The anode plates are cast in copper molds, so to avoid the contact of the liquid copper and the <b>solid</b> copper <b>mold,</b> a solution of barium sulfate in water {{is used as a}} coating material on the mold surface. Thus when the liquid copper solidifies in form of an anode plate it can be easily released from its mold.|$|R

The use of a UV-transparent mold is difficult in a vacuum, because a vacuum chuck to hold the mold would not be possible.|$|R

30|$|Hydrogels are {{polymeric}} materials with three-dimensional (3 D) network structure having hydrophilic polymer chains as well as their ability to absorb and retain a {{large volume of}} water in their interstitial structures (Chai et al. 2017; Ebara et al. 2014; Yuan 2013). Upon contact with water, hydrogels continue to absorb and swell to form 3 D structure due {{to the presence of}} hydrophilic groups, such as–NH 2, –OH, –COOH, –SO 3 H in their polymer networks and osmotic pressure (Yuan 2013). The ability to hold an unaltered 3 D structure during swelling is caused by physical or chemical crosslinking that also helps prevent hydrogels from dissolution in the solvent (Rizwan et al. 2017). Physical crosslinking is a temporal connection due to hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions or electrostatic interactions between polar groups. On the other hand, chemical crosslinking is a permanent junction formed by covalent bonds, along with a relatively stronger ionic communication between various functional groups of introduced crosslinking agents (Ahmed 2015). Therefore, different polymeric structures including homo-polymers, linear copolymers, and block or graft copolymers are formed because of physical and/or chemical crosslinking during the polymerization process (Hoffman 2012). Besides, hydrogels are being used in various physical forms, which could be <b>solid</b> <b>molded</b> forms (soft contact lenses), pressed powder matrices (pills or capsules for oral ingestion), microparticles (as bio-adhesive carriers or wound treatments), coatings (on implants or catheters), membranes or sheets (as a reservoir in a transdermal drug delivery patch), encapsulated solids (in osmotic pumps) and liquids (that form gels upon heating or cooling) (Ebara et al. 2014).|$|R

The surfaces are usually defined with datum curves {{in space and}} a variety of complex commands. Surfacing is more difficult, but better applicable to some manufacturing techniques, like injection <b>molding.</b> <b>Solid</b> models for injection molded parts usually have both surfacing and sketcher based features.|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} axisymmetric {{problem of}} solidification of a superheated liquid {{in a long}} cylindrical mold has been studied in this paper by employing a new embedding technique. The mold and the melt has an imperfect contact and the heat transfer coefficient has been taken {{as a function of}} space and time. Short-time exact analytical solutions for the moving boundary and temperature distributions in the liquid, <b>solid</b> and <b>mold</b> have been obtained. The numerical results indicate that with the present solution, for some parameter values, substantial solidified thickness can be obtained. The method of solution is simple and straightforward, and consists of assuming fictitious initial temperatures for some suitable fictitious extensions of the actual regions. Sufficient conditions for the commencement of the solidification have been discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe final {{quality of}} <b>solid</b> wood <b>molding</b> depends on several factors, where {{the choice of}} cutting {{conditions}} and consequently the tool performance are key points when processing this type of material because tool wear affects physical-chemical and thermodynamic behavior of the surface submitted to coating. One of the main problems at the production line is to achieve an adequate monitoring system of the cutting process to prevent and detect operational problems or loss of productivity. The objective {{of this research is}} to evaluate results from two different control process methods, such as sound pressure and electrical current measurement submitted during different cutting conditions and to determine the cutting distance increase, as innovative methods to estimate tool wear when appearance grade products are being produced...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{reported}} investigation on 118 cases of this disease in the previous paper, which suggested marked discrepancy of its clinical symptoms between the juvenile form and adult one. Moreover, it has been pointed out that serial bilateral carotid and vertebral angiography should be absolutely necessary to distinguish those cases from other occlusive diseases of the internal carotid, and suggested that this disease would be {{a particular type of}} cerebral vascular abnormality of the Japanese. Postmortem examination on five autopsy cases has been done up to the present time, but the pathological findings brought no contribution to the pathogenesis of the disease. Therefore animal experiment has been attempted to elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease. Complete or incomplete occlusion has been performed bilaterally on the dog brain at the site of carotid siphon (C(1)) immediately distal portion to the origin of the posterior communicating artery. The arteries were successfully clipped in 8 dogs. Bilateral carotid angiographies was carried out with the intervals (from 3 months to 12 months) after the surgery on each dogs, but abnormal vascular network was never observed in all cases. The <b>solid</b> <b>molding</b> specimen of the circle of Willis also demonstrated no abnormal vascular network {{at the site of the}} occlusion in these experimental dogs. Histological examination revieled a minimal thickning of the wall of the arteries at the distal part of the occlusion and dilatation of artrioles which belong to the middle cerebral arteries. It could be denied by this experiment that the acquired occlusion of the circle of Willis will bring forth the abnormal vascular network at the base of the brain. The pathogenesis of the disease is still obscure but it is in my opinion that the previous clinical investigation as well as this animal experiment suggested congenital vascular malformation of the circle of Willis...|$|R
50|$|Using {{the carbon}} roving as an {{electric}} heating element offers the possibility to manufacture composite structures with embedded heating layers. Due to the high flexibility {{in the design of}} the heating pattern an overall nearly equal heat distribution can be achieved. In terms of applications this technology embedded in <b>solid</b> composite <b>molds</b> is very beneficial for resin consolidation and binder activation in out-of-autoclave processes. Composite molds show similar heat expansion properties as the manufactured composite parts. The lower thermal mass of composite tools compared to common metal molds help to shorten the manufacturing cycle of FRP parts and decrease the energy need for the production process. Further the TFP heating elements can be applied in CFRP wing structures of airplanes or blades of wind mills for anti- and de-icing tasks. The TFP structure embedded in elastomeric heating bags can applied to manufacturing or repairing processes of composite parts.|$|R
50|$|This {{process is}} related to vacuum bag molding {{in exactly the same}} way as it sounds. A <b>solid</b> female <b>mold</b> is used along with a {{flexible}} male mold. The reinforcement is placed inside the female mold with just enough resin to allow the fabric to stick in place (wet lay up). A measured amount of resin is then liberally brushed indiscriminately into the mold and the mold is then clamped to a machine that contains the male flexible mold. The flexible male membrane is then inflated with heated compressed air or possibly steam. The female mold can also be heated. Excess resin is forced out along with trapped air. This process is extensively used in the production of composite helmets due to the lower cost of unskilled labor. Cycle times for a helmet bag moulding machine vary from 20 to 45 minutes, but the finished shells require no further curing if the molds are heated.|$|R

40|$|An {{injection}} molding {{process for the}} fabrication of disposable plastic microfluidic chips with a cycle time of 2 min has been designed, developed, and implemented. Of the sixteen commercially available grades of cyclo-olefin copolymer (COC) that were screened for autofluorescence and transparency to ultraviolet (UV) light, Topas 8007610 was identified as the most suitable for production. A robust <b>solid</b> metal <b>mold</b> insert defining the microfluidic channels was rapidly microfabricated using a process that significantly reduces the time required for electroplating. No wear of the insert was observed even after over 1000 cycles. The chips were bonded by thermal fusion using different bonding conditions. Each condition was tested and its suitability evaluated by burst pressure measurements. The COC microfluidic chips feature novel, integrated, reversible, standardized, ready-to-use interconnects that enable operation at pressures up to 15. 6 MPa, the highest value reported to date. The suitability of these UV transparent, high pressure-resistant, disposable devices was demonstrated by in situ preparation of a high surface area porous polymer monolith within the channels...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the rising}} demand of {{light-weight}} constructions {{as well as the}} conservation of resources, the density and weight of thermoplastic parts could be influenced significantly by using the thermoplastic foam injection molding process. The structure of the foam injection molded part, which typically means solid surface layers and a cellular core, usually results in a weight saving. Furthermore the materials structure leads to an increasing of the specific bending stiffness with a simultaneous low tendency to warp. The present study was aimed to analyze the interactions between microcellular structure, joining process and the resulting mechanical properties of the molded part. Therefore, the microcellular injection molding process (MuCell®) as well as the vibration welding were used. Whereas the established welding processes for <b>solid</b> injection <b>molded</b> parts have already achieved a high degree of perfection within the last decades, the joining of microcellular thermoplastics entails several specific characteristics, because the injection foaming process highly influences the basic material properties. In contrast to solid materials, the weld seam properties after joining are mainly affected by the design constraints of the microcellular structure...|$|R
