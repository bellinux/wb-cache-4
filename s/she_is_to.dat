5|$|Freyr arrives {{home and}} neither sleeps nor drinks, {{remaining}} in silence. No one dares speak to him. The god Njörðr sends Freyr's servant Skírnir {{to speak to}} Freyr. Freyr tells Skírnir that he saw a beautiful woman, so beautiful that he was filled with grief {{and that he would}} soon die if he could not have her. Freyr tells Skírnir that he must go gain her hand on his behalf—whether the woman's father agrees or not—and he will be rewarded. Skírnir replies that he accepts the mission but only in exchange for Freyr's sword, which can fight on its own. Freyr gives him the sword and Skírnir sets off. Skírnir asks for the woman's hand for Freyr and receives her promise. Nine nights later <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> meet with Freyr at a location called Barey. Skírnir delivers the news to Freyr and Freyr responds with the final stanza from the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál, lamenting that he must wait.|$|E

And, being at the table, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> watch my master. Whatever she saw him drink, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> insist on your {{drinking}} it too. You heard me ask leave to make the tea?" ...|$|R

60|$|Weston {{understood}} this <b>to</b> mean that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> disposed <b>to</b> stay where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> and talk <b>to</b> him awhile, which suggested that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> some extent reassured about his condition.|$|R
5|$|Speaking on the {{evolving}} relationship of Clark and Chloe, Mack {{believes that the}} season six introduction of Jimmy Olsen into Chloe's life increased her value to Clark. Before, Chloe would drop anything for Clark, but now that Chloe has other priorities, it makes Clark realize how valuable <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> him. The introduction of Jimmy Olsen also provides Chloe with someone she can finally have a romantic relationship with. The relationship is strained when Chloe has to lie to cover up Clark's secret, as well as keeping {{the fact that she}} is meteor-infected hidden. Writer Holly Harold questions whether or not Jimmy has taken over the place in Chloe's heart that Clark occupied for so long.|$|E

She is terrified that the kingdom's {{citizens}} might {{find out about}} her powers and fear for her. The castle gates {{open to the public}} and visiting dignitaries {{for the first time in}} years. Amongst them is the scheming Duke of Weselton, and the dashing Prince Hans of the Southern Isles, with whom Anna falls head-over-heels in love. Elsa’s coronation happens without a hitch, but she still remains distant from Anna. When Hans proposes to Anna, Elsa objects, accidentally unleashing her powers before the court. The Duke brands her a monster. Elsa flees the kingdom, but her suppressed magic engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter. Reaching the North Mountain, Elsa discards her crown and creates a palace of ice in which to live a solitary life.|$|E
5|$|When Lisa {{succeeds in}} making {{friends with a}} group of local children, Bart becomes jealous and plots revenge against Lisa. He decides to teach Lisa a lesson by showing her friends her yearbook, {{revealing}} that she is a nerd. Lisa is furious at Bart, thinking that his disclosure has turned her friends away. Eventually, at a carnival, Bart realises how depressed Lisa has become, and how he cost her the only friends she has ever had. However, when Lisa returns to the beach house from the carnival she finds her friends in the act of decorating the Simpsons' car with sea shells in her honor, and they explain that they like her for who <b>she</b> <b>is.</b> <b>To</b> make up with Lisa, Bart has them sign her yearbook.|$|E

25|$|Tiresias {{also appears}} in Sophocles' Antigone. Creon, now king of Thebes, refuses to allow Polynices to be buried. His niece, Antigone, defies {{the order and}} is caught; Creon decrees that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be buried alive. The gods express their disapproval of Creon's {{decision}} through Tiresias, who tells Creon 'the city is sick through your fault.' However, Antigone has already hanged herself rather than be buried alive. When Creon arrives at the tomb where <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be interred, his son, Haemon who was betrothed to Antigone, attacks Creon and then kills himself. When Creon's wife, Eurydice, is informed of her son and Antigone's deaths, she too takes her own life.|$|E

25|$|Breastfeeding {{represents}} an opportunity cost, {{as the mother}} must spend hours each day breastfeeding instead of other activities, such as paid work or home production (such as growing food). In general, the higher the mother's earning power, the less likely <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> save money by breastfeeding.|$|E
50|$|Zwanziger {{was judged}} {{guilty of murder}} and sentenced <b>to</b> death. Before <b>she</b> <b>was</b> beheaded, <b>she</b> said it <b>was</b> {{probably}} a good thing <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> executed, as <b>she</b> did not think <b>she</b> would <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> stop.|$|R

60|$|That <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> look on him dying {{had been}} {{persistently}} in her mind, but that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> see him mangled by an assassin added horror to her dread.

25|$|She {{has given}} concerts in North America and Australia {{as well as}} many venues in East and Southeast Asia, {{including}} charity concerts. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> date the only C-pop artist to have performed four times in Tokyo's Budokan.

25|$|For {{reasons that}} are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> have a {{multiple}} birth naturally. It is theorized that {{this is due to}} the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation.|$|E
25|$|DiNovo has {{announced}} that {{she will not be}} standing for re-election in the 2018 provincial election and is expected to resign her seat in the legislature at the end of 2017. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> become the minister of the Trinity-St. Paul’s Centre for Faith, Arts and Justice effective January 1, 2018 and will continue to present the Radical Reverend program on CIUT radio.|$|E
60|$|For {{that night}} Marie's duty <b>to</b> her uncle <b>was</b> done. So much had <b>been</b> understood. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> dress herself {{and sit down}} to supper, and after that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{disturbed}} again till the morrow. On the next morning <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> subjected <b>to</b> the grand trial. She understood this so well that she went about the house fearless on that evening--fearless as regarded the moment, fearful only as regarded the morrow.|$|R
6000|$|Dolores did not {{ask what}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> do, <b>she</b> knew enough already about trials <b>to</b> {{understand}} that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> only <b>to</b> answer questions, and she presently said, ...|$|R
60|$|The sun had fairly risen, {{when the}} Neshamony {{came down on}} the Anne's weather-quarter, both craft then {{standing}} to the northward. The Neshamony had seen nothing. The governor now directed her commander to stand directly down towards Rancocus Island. If she saw nothing, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> go in and land, {{in order to get}} the news from the people ashore. Unless the information obtained in this way was of a nature that demanded a different course, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> beat up to the volcano, reconnoitre there, then stand across to the cove, and go in; whence <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> sail for the Reef, unless she could hear of the governor at some other point, when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make the best of her way to him.|$|R
25|$|The last trial Venus imposes on Psyche is a {{quest to}} the underworld itself. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> take a box (pyxis) and obtain in it a dose of the beauty of Proserpina, queen of the underworld. Venus claims her own beauty has faded through tending her ailing son, and she needs this remedy in order to attend the theatre of the gods (theatrum deorum).|$|E
25|$|In San Francisco in 1941, private {{investigators}} Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) and Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan) meet prospective client Ruth Wonderly (Mary Astor).

25|$|After commissioning, {{the ship}} sailed to its home port of Lyttelton {{arriving}} 28 June 2007. After {{several days of}} inaugural events, it departed again on 2 July.

50|$|Thus, Bat's mission <b>was</b> {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of {{the utmost}} importance. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> protect the River Queen from attackers of any sort; and, should his ship <b>be</b> damaged, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> take Mr. Lincoln and his party on board and to carry them to safety.|$|R

25|$|At dawn, Venus sets {{a second}} task for Psyche. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> cross a river and fetch golden wool from violent sheep who graze {{on the other}} side. These sheep are {{elsewhere}} identified as belonging to the Sun. Psyche's only intention is to drown herself on the way, but instead she is saved by instructions from a divinely inspired reed, of the type used to make musical instruments, and gathers the wool caught on briers.|$|E
25|$|The husband, too, is {{indirectly}} implied to {{have some}} responsibilities to his wife. The Torah obligates a man to not deprive his wife of food, clothing, or of sexual activity; if the husband does not provide the first wife with these things, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be divorced, without cost to her. The Talmud interprets this as a requirement {{for a man to}} provide food and clothing to, and have sex with, each of his wives, even if he only has one.|$|E
25|$|Doro {{discovers that}} when Anyanwu {{transforms}} into an animal, he cannot sense or kill her. Feeling threatened by her shape-shifting ability, he wonders whether he holds enough control over her. Anyanwu witnesses Doro’s barbaric ways and plain disregard for his people, which frightens her. When {{they arrive at}} the seed village, Doro tells Anyanwu that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> marry Isaac, bear his children {{and the children of}} whomever else Doro chooses. Anyanwu eventually agrees once Isaac convinces her that she could be the only one to get through to Doro.|$|E
