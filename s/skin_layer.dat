5|$|Burns {{that affect}} only the {{superficial}} skin layers {{are known as}} superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends {{into some of the}} underlying <b>skin</b> <b>layer,</b> it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.|$|E

25|$|Amphibians possess {{two types}} of glands, mucous and {{granular}} (serous). Both of these glands {{are part of the}} integument and thus considered cutaneous. Mucous and granular glands are both divided into three different sections which all connect to structure the gland as a whole. The three individual parts of the gland are the duct, the intercalary region, and lastly the alveolar gland (sac). Structurally, the duct is derived via keratinocytes and passes through {{to the surface of the}} epidermal or outer <b>skin</b> <b>layer</b> thus allowing external secretions of the body. The gland alveolus is a sac shaped structure which is found on the bottom or base region of the granular gland. The cells in this sac specialize in secretion. Between the alveolar gland and the duct is the intercalary system which can be summed up as a transitional region connecting the duct to the grand alveolar beneath the epidermal <b>skin</b> <b>layer.</b> In general, granular glands are larger in size than the mucous glands, however mucous glands hold a much greater majority in overall number.|$|E
25|$|Water resistance: The skin {{acts as a}} water {{resistant}} barrier so essential nutrients aren't washed out of the body. The nutrients and oils that help hydrate the skin are covered by the most outer <b>skin</b> <b>layer,</b> the epidermis. This is helped {{in part by the}} sebaceous glands that release sebum, an oily liquid. Water itself will not cause the elimination of oils on the skin, because the oils residing in our dermis flow and would be affected by water without the epidermis.|$|E

Bruises can appear as halos around a tattoo, or, if blood pools, as one larger bruise. This bluish or dark blurry halo that surrounds a tattoo {{can also be}} attributed to ink diffusion or 'blow-out'. Commonly mistaken for a hematoma, this discolouration occurs when tattoo pigments spread out into the subcutaneous tissue beneath the dermal <b>skin</b> <b>layer,</b> and {{may be caused by}} ink being deposited too deep in the skin.|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of increasing the}} human-skin probing depth by the method of reflection confocal microscopy (RCM) upon decreasing the amplitude of spatial fluctuations of the refractive index of the upper <b>skin</b> <b>layers</b> is considered. A change in the probing depth is estimated by analysing the spatial distribution of the probability density of the effective optical paths of detected photons calculated by the Monte Carlo method. The results of the numerical simulation are interpreted {{within the framework of}} the possible application of RCM to the study of the human skin exposed to an immersion liquid compatible to it. A diffusion of the immersion agent into the skin depth involves the equalising of the refractive indices of the structural elements of near-surface <b>skin</b> <b>layers,</b> which in turn causes a decrease in the scattering intensity and a certain increase in the transparency of the upper tissue layers. It is shown that a decrease in the light scattering in the near-surface <b>skin</b> <b>layers</b> leads to a significant increase in the probing depth obtained with the RCM technique...|$|R
40|$|Faculty Mentor: Dr. Gregory Triplett, Electrical and Computer EngineeringAbstract only availableNumerous {{technical}} challenges {{preventing the}} development of non-invasive blood measurement techniques involve the interfaces between the primary <b>skin</b> <b>layers.</b> The ability to accurately and non-invasively measure human glucose level characteristics potentially lies within optical-based systems. Current reliable blood analysis techniques invariably require intravenous blood extraction. A much preferred blood flow measurement setup would utilizes harmless levels of electromagnetic radiation that penetrates beneath the skin and provides feedback which corresponds with important properties of red blood cells, the hemoglobin and hence glucose levels. However, there exist numerous major technical challenges, which include the lack of accurate models that describe light interaction and characteristics of the skin, particularly at the interface between the primary layers: the epidermis, and dermis. It remains essential to explore alternative approaches that may evolve into reliable, accurate, and pain-free blood analysis techniques that account for the interactions between these critical <b>skin</b> <b>layers.</b> The development of a physical model of the skin will {{provide a framework for}} exploring integrated optoelectronic systems.

50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of harlequin-type ichthyosis relies on both physical examination and certain laboratory tests.Physical assessment at birth {{is vital for}} the initial {{diagnosis of}} harlequin ichthyosis. Physical examination reveals characteristic symptoms of the condition especially the abnormalities in the skin surface of newborns. Abnormal findings in physical assessments usually result in employing other diagnostic tests to ascertain the diagnosis.Genetic testing is the most specific diagnostic test for harlequin ichthyosis. This test reveals a loss of function mutation on the ABCA12 gene. This gene {{is important in the}} regulation of protein synthesis {{for the development of the}} <b>skin</b> <b>layer.</b> Mutations in the gene may cause impaired transport of lipids in the <b>skin</b> <b>layer</b> and may also lead to shrunken versions of the proteins responsible for skin development. Less severe mutations result in a collodion membrane and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma-like presentation. ABCA12 is an ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, and is a member of a large family of proteins that hydrolyze ATP to transport cargo across membranes. ABCA12 is thought to be a lipid transporter in keratinocytes necessary for lipid transport into lamellar granules during the formation of the lipid barrier. Biopsy of skin may be done to assess the histologic characteristics of the cells. Histological findings usually reveal hyperkeratotic skin cells, which leads to a thick, white and hard <b>skin</b> <b>layer.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{scheme to}} {{fabricate}} forward osmosis membranes comprising a highly porous sublayer sandwiched between two selective <b>skin</b> <b>layers</b> via phase inversion was proposed. One severe deficiency of existing composite and asymmetric membranes used in forward osmosis {{is the presence}} of unfavorable internal concentration polarization within the porous support layer that hinders both (i) separation (salt flux) and (ii) the performance (water flux). The double <b>skin</b> <b>layers</b> of the tailored membrane may mitigate the internal concentration polarization by preventing the salt and other solutes in the draw solution from penetrating into the membrane porous support. The prototype double-skinned cellulose acetate membrane displayed a water flux of 48. 2 L·m- 2 ·h - 1 and lower reverse salt transport of 6. 5 g·m - 2 ·h- 1 using 5. 0 M MgCl 2 as the draw solution in a forward osmosis process performed at 22 °C. This {{can be attributed to the}} effective salt rejection by the double <b>skin</b> <b>layers</b> and the low water transport resistance within the porous support layer. The prospects of utilizing the double-selective layer membranes may have potential application in forward osmosis for desalination. This study may help pave the way to improve the membrane design for the forward osmosis process. © 2010 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|Pathogenesis of {{psoriasis}} {{involves the}} keratinocytes in epidermis {{as well as}} the angiogenesis involving deeper <b>skin</b> <b>layers.</b> So, the drug delivery strategy should be customized to localize paclitaxel (PCL) inside both layers. In this investigation, in order to achieve penetration of PCL into deeper <b>skin</b> <b>layers</b> while minimizing the systemic escape, a nanoemulsion (NE) was formulated and evaluated its in vivo pharmacokinetic performance. Further, the same formulation was explored for peroral bioavailability enhancement of PCL. Upon dermal application, the drug was predominantly localized in deeper <b>skin</b> <b>layers,</b> with minimal systemic escape. When orally administered as NE, PCL was rapidly absorbed reaching a steady-state value of 3. 5 μg/ml in 30 minutes, and steady-state levels persisted up to 18 hours. This has amounted to an absolute bioavailability of 70. 62 %. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein efflux by d-α-tocopheryl polyethyleneglycol 1, 000 succinate and labrasol would have contributed to the enhanced peroral bioavailability of PCL. This investigation provides direct evidence on the localization of large molecular weight, lipophilic drug, PCL, in dermis.
