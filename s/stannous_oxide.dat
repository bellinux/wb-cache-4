40|$|Background: Induction of haemeoxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) {{increases}} adiponectin secretion by remodeling {{adipose tissue}} in obesity. The objective {{of our study}} is to explore whether HO- 1 induction directly improves endothelial function independent of adiponectin changes in obese rats. Methods: Rats were divided into control and obesity groups. Aortic endothelial function was determined by measuring endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (EDV). Vascular segments of the obese rats were incubated in an organ bath in {{the presence or absence}} of cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) or CoPP plus <b>stannous</b> protoporphyrin. Nitric <b>oxide</b> (NO) production, superoxide anion production and NF-&# 954;B p 65 expression in the aorta were determined. The expression of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in endothelial cells was determined by western blotting. The aortic rings from the obese rats were then incubated with CoPP in the presence of specific inhibitors of AMPK, phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) or eNOS. Results: Acetylcholine-induced EDV was significantly attenuated in the obese rats, compared with the NC group (p p in vitro in the presence of inhibitors of AMPK, PI 3 K or eNOS. HO- 1 induction with CoPP significantly increased the activation of the AMPK-PI 3 K/Akt-eNOS pathway and NO production in parallel with reduced superoxide anion production and NF-&# 954;B p 65 expression in obese rats. Conclusions: HO- 1 induction with CoPP directly improved endothelial function in obese rats independent of adiponectin changes. The mechanism of this protective effect is related to increasing NO production by activation of the AMPK-PI 3 K/Akt-eNOS signaling pathway...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Plate-out is defined, {{in the context of}} this research, as a hard deposit that can be found adhered to the surface of screw, barrel and die resulting in the loss of output performance and ultimate extrude quality. It is typically is seen as a coloured deposit, ranging from white through to brown that can occur at any time in the process. Plate-out occurs randomly with SantopreneTM TPV products within a manufactured lot, or from lot-to-lot without any changes to the base formulation or manufacturing procedures or practices. The aim of the research was firstly to understand the influences of various elements of the extrusion process and any interactions on the formation of plate-out. The second aspect of the research was to investigate whether deposited plate-out had in itself any form and structure. Two experimental routes were taken. The first was a university based small scale laboratory extrusion study; the second complementary approach was industrially based; involving the ExxonMobil Newport manufacturing plant supported by the company analytical laboratories based in Brussels. The programme of work explicitly excluded in depth analysis of the chemistry involved in the manufacture of SantopreneTM TPV, this remaining proprietary to the company. The results of the study of the effects of the processing variables conclude that plate-out formation is complex and no single variable removed or reduced it. With a combination of lower process temperature, longer residence times and higher melt compression there is an increased likelihood that plate-out will form. For the film type deposit which contains novolac resin and zinc chloride, the onset of migration of these materials is seen to occur in the transition zone. This is believed to be the tie-layer precursor to plate-out deposition further along the screw. Two types of plate-out were identified, a powdery deposit and a film deposit. Both contained clay filler, <b>stannous</b> chloride, zinc <b>oxide</b> but the film deposit also contained traces of novolac resin and zinc chloride. The plate-out was confirmed to have its own distinct cross sectional structure...|$|R

A {{series of}} {{catalysis}} hydrolytic depolymerization of PET catalyzed by zinc acetate, zinc sulfate, <b>stannous</b> <b>oxide</b> respectively under microwave irradiation at different temperature with time was studied, {{in which the}} microwave power was 260 W, the ratio of water to PET was 10 : 1 and the dosage of the catalysts was 0. 5 % of PET. The relative {{number average molecular weight}} of the undepolymerized PET was determined by end-group method. The results show that the molecular weight of the undepolymerized PET decreases with the reaction time increasing, and tends to be stable {{at the end of the}} depolymerization reaction. Under the same time, the temperature is higher, the molecular weight is smaller.

Insitu {{polymerization}} of aniline {{was carried}} out in the presence of <b>stannous</b> <b>oxide</b> (SnO) to synthesize Polyaniline (PAni) /SnO composites by chemical oxidation method. The surface morphology of the composites were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding properties of the composites were investigated for different wt % of SnO (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 wt%) in PAni. The EMI measurements were carried out in the frequency range from 8. 2 to 12. 4 GHz (X-band), which is relevant for practical applications. EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE), microwave absorption and reflection, the influence of SnO concentration in PAni on EMI SE of the composites are reported. The composites exhibit EMI SE value of- 18 to- 23 dB. The absorption dominated EMI SE of these composites indicates the potential applications of these materials for microwave attenuation in the X-band...|$|E
40|$|A {{method to}} {{determine}} the extent of active inflammatory bowel disease using selective labelling of autologous neutrophils and monocytes by phagocytosis of a technetium- 99 m (99 mTc) <b>stannous</b> <b>oxide</b> colloid is described. Unlike leucocyte scanning techniques using Indium-III (IIIIn), the 99 mTc colloid scan uses a cheap, readily available isotope, which specifically labels phagocytes. Scan results in 20 patients with inflammatory bowel disease were compared with barium examinations and colonoscopic appearances. There was close agreement in 15 of 20 patients as to the extent of mucosal disease. In four cases the scan showed more extensive disease than was suggested by barium examination. The scan showed terminal ileal Crohn's disease in three patients in whom the barium studies of the ileum had been reported as normal. In four patients with inactive disease and normal barium examinations no activity was seen on the scans. The 99 mTc phagocyte scan is a sensitive, reliable means of determining the extent of active inflammatory bowel disease and can be used to quantify disease activity...|$|E
40|$|Atomically thin {{semiconductors}} {{are one of}} {{the fastest}} growing categories in materials science due to their promise to enable high-performance electronic and optical devices. Furthermore, a host of intriguing phenomena have been reported to occur when a semiconductor is confined within two dimensions. However, the synthesis of large area atomically thin materials remains as a significant technological challenge. Here we report a method that allows harvesting monolayer of semiconducting <b>stannous</b> <b>oxide</b> nanosheets (SnO) from the interfacial oxide layer of liquid tin. The method takes advantage of van der Waals forces occurring between the interfacial oxide layer and a suitable substrate that is brought into contact with the molten metal. Due to the liquid state of the metallic precursor, the surface oxide sheet can be delaminated with ease and on a large scale. The SnO monolayer is determined to feature p-type semiconducting behavior with a bandgap of ∼ 4. 2 eV. Field effect transistors based on monolayer SnO are demonstrated. The synthetic technique is facile, scalable and holds promise for creating atomically thin semiconductors at wafer scale...|$|E
