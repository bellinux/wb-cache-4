Following his graduation from Oxford, he married Edith Kerr, a wealthy American heiress to a thread manufacturing empire, on 3 February 1923 in Montclair, New Jersey.

25|$|<b>Sizing</b> <b>up</b> the situation, Sgt Owens {{decided that}} the only way to {{neutralize}} the gun was to charge it directly from the front. Calling on four volunteers to assist him, he positioned them where they could place supporting bunkers under fire. At the moment when he judged he had a fair chance of reaching his objective, the six-feet-three, 232-pound Marine charged right into the very mouth of the still rapidly firing cannon. Entering the emplacement through the fire port, he chased the Japanese out the back where they were cut down by his rifleman. Pursuing them, he in turn was instantly killed.|$|E

2500|$|Dancers {{continually}} {{interact with}} the customers in the club. [...] They walk around and solicit drinks and lap dances, usually scanning the club floor {{to find the most}} lucrative customer to greet.

[...] Clubs generate revenue by cover charges, selling drinks, and other means. [...] Dancers make most of their income from giving lap dances or VIP dances, where regulations allow. [...] Otherwise, customer tips, at the stage, are a dancer's primary form of income. Dancers are entertaining the customers in exchange for money and employing all of the resources at their disposal to do so.

When Putin soon sized up the Obama administration's appeasement around the globe—from fake red lines for Syria, to a scramble out of Iraq, to chaos in Libya—he moved into Crimea...As he swallows Eastern Ukraine, he now eyes the Baltic States. He does not quite have a map on his wall of a new czarist Orthodox state the size of the Soviet Union, but he does have a general sense {{that there are a lot}} more former Soviet republics to be had—and he is eager to poke here and there to find out which will be the easiest to grab next." [...] In another 2015 column, Hanson wrote about he sees as Putin's mindset that: [...] "Obama's false step-over, red, and deadlines confirmed Putin's impressions of the continued weak leadership of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John Kerry. He probably believes that he can do to Estonia what he has done to Crimea or Ukraine—and without too many more consequences. Putin is not greatly worried that the U.S. will re-energize NATO, rebuild its own nuclear deterrent, work with the Eastern Europeans on missile defense, or start exporting its plentiful natural gas to a Russia-dependent Europe. Right now Putin is digesting Eastern Ukraine and <b>sizing</b> <b>up</b> Obama's responses to others' aggressions. But next year, in the last twelve months of the Obama administration, we should expect him to move on another former Soviet republic, as well as to emphasize new partnerships with China, a few Eastern European or Balkan nations, or an ascendant Iran." ...|$|E

6000|$|I knocked softly, {{and when}} I saw the kind {{face of the}} middle-aged woman who answered, as by {{inspiration}} came to me the [...] "story" [...] I was to tell. For know that upon his ability to tell a good story depends {{the success of the}} beggar. First of all, and on the instant, the beggar must [...] "size up" [...] his victim. After that, he must tell a story that will appeal to the peculiar personality and temperament of that particular victim. And right here arises the great difficulty: in the instant that he is <b>sizing</b> <b>up</b> the victim he must begin his story. Not a minute is allowed for preparation. As in a lightning flash he must divine the nature of the victim and conceive a tale that will hit home. The successful hobo must be an artist. He must create spontaneously and instantaneously--and not upon a theme selected from the plenitude of his own imagination, but upon the theme he reads {{in the face of the}} person who opens the door, be it man, woman, or child, sweet or crabbed, generous or miserly, good-natured or cantankerous, Jew or Gentile, black or white, race-prejudiced or brotherly, provincial or universal, or whatever else it may be. I have often thought that to this training of my tramp days is due much of my success as a story-writer. In order to get the food whereby I lived, I was compelled to tell tales that rang true. At the back door, out of inexorable necessity, is developed the convincingness and sincerity laid down by all authorities on the art of the short-story. Also, I quite believe it was my tramp-apprenticeship that made a realist out of me. Realism constitutes the only goods one can exchange at the kitchen door for grub.|$|E
