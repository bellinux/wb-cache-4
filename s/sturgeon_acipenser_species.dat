40|$|Purpose. The {{literature}} {{analysis of}} the results cryopreservation of different fish species highlights a variation of many parameters, in particular the sperm survival rate during the freezing and unfreezing process. The survival capability of spermatozoa may be called the main parameter, which indentifies {{the efficiency of the}} entire process of low temperature freezing of reproductive products. Therefore, the goal of this work was to investigate and find the causes of different degrees of fish sperm cryoimmunity, in particular that of starlet, which is a valuable of <b>sturgeon</b> (<b>Acipenser)</b> <b>species.</b> We also studies the possibility to find the optimum ways to improve the efficiency of the survival rate of the defrosted spermatozoa of different fish species for their further use to produce viable offspring. Methodology. The determination of sterlet sperm membrane permeability was performed after carrying out all necessary manipulations with brood males which included: prespawning incubation, hormonal stimulation, determination of sperm maturity degree, obtaining the sperm by stripping. The measurement of sperm membrane permeability for water molecules was performed based on the technique, which had been used earlier to measure carp sperm permeability, but taking account the specific peculiarities inherent to sterlet sperm. Findings. Based on the performed measurements, we determined the sterlet sperm membrane permeability for water molecules with the use of photometric method. The received experimental data show the highest degree of sterlet sperm membrane permeability for water molecules as compared to carp sperm membrane permeability. Originality. As a result of this experiment, we determined {{for the first time the}} absolute value of sterlet sperm membrane permeability for water molecules with the use of photometric method as well as compared the results with those obtained during our work with the carp sperm. Practical value. The data obtained during the experimental studies can be used in the practice of sperm cryopreservation for improving the efficiency of the sperm different of fish species during the process of low temperature freezing especially for such commercially valuable fish species as sturgens...|$|E

Herein, we examine Cox 1 and control region diversity in a sample of Siberian <b>sturgeon</b> (<b>Acipenser</b> baerii), a <b>species</b> with an extremely wide geographic distribution in the major rivers of Siberia and in Lake Baikal. Some authors currently recognize three subspecies within this species. These subspecies are reasonable candidates for species units detectable through DNA barcoding. The Cox 1 gene illustrated no variation within the species, while the control region displayed statistically significant differences among the subspecies using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). Given the uniformity of Cox 1 sequences recovered, Cox 1 is probably a good region for barcoding A. baerii at the species level. Although control region variation among subspecies was significant, diagnostic differences were not found for any of the subspecies...|$|R

30|$|Sturgeons {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} wildlife commodities on earth. Twenty-seven species of sturgeon exist in the diverse habitats of the northern hemisphere including rivers, estuaries, near-shore oceanic environments, and inland seas. The Caspian Sea is the largest inland water body in the world. The greatest abundance of sturgeon inhabits in the Caspian Sea which is the largest and most important sturgeon fisheries (Ovissipour and Rasco 2012). Six species of sturgeon occur in the Caspian Sea basin (beluga, Russian, Persian, sterlet, stellate, ship; Pikitch et al. 2005). Fuelled by the lucrative international caviar market, the stocks of many sturgeon species have faced rapid declines (Bronzi et al. 2011). In response to the declining sturgeon stocks, commercial sturgeon production in farms has been undertaken by many countries. The Siberian <b>sturgeon</b> (<b>Acipenser</b> baerii), Russian <b>sturgeon</b> (<b>Acipenser</b> gueldenstaedtii), Adriatic <b>sturgeon</b> (<b>Acipenser</b> naccarii), white <b>sturgeon</b> (<b>Acipenser</b> transmontanus), beluga <b>sturgeon</b> (Huso huso), and several hybrids are the main cultured sturgeon species (Badiani et al. 1997; Ercan 2011; Oliveira et al. 2006; Vaccaro et al. 2005).|$|R

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the main}} global {{priorities}} nowadays is finding sustainable methods of increasing food production. However, profit maximization remains {{the primary purpose of}} every economic activity. The integration of aquaculture recirculating systems with different aquaponics techniques comes as a respond to both requirements that were mentioned above. The aim of present research is to make a comparative cost effectiveness analysis in two integrated aquaponics systems, where both deep water culture (DWC) and light expanded clay aggregate (LECA) substrate aquaponic techniques were applied. Four combinations of fish and plants species were used as follows: rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) – spinach (Spinacia oleracea), stellate <b>sturgeon</b> (<b>Acipenser</b> stellatus) – spinach (Spinacia oleracea), stellate <b>sturgeon</b> (<b>Acipenser</b> stellatus) – mint (Mentha piperita) and stellate <b>sturgeon</b> (<b>Acipenser</b> stellatus) – tarragon (Artemisa dracunculus L.). Three production scales were used for the first two mentioned fish to plants combinations, as follows: 59 crops/m 2; 48 crops/m 2 and 39 crops/m 2. For each experiment, the cost analysis includes capital costs and operational costs. As main conclusions, we can point out that LECA substrate aquaponics technique requires a higher investment cost, comparing with DWC technique, but also had generated higher incomes, which led in the end to better economic indicators. The combination of fish to plants stellate <b>sturgeon</b> (<b>Acipenser</b> stellatus) – spinach (Spinacia oleracea), produced by applying LECA substrate aquaponics technique, had proved to be the most economic feasible, from all tested variants. It is recommended that alternative variants for power to be implemented, in order to minimize the electricity operational costs and therefore, to improve the profitability of tested facilities...|$|R

After measuring 25 Iberian specimens from a ®shery and several Spanish and Por- tuguese museums and applying stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA), four specimens preserved in di erent museums [two specimens from the Guadalquivir river (EBD- 8173 and EBD- 8174), one specimen from the Tagus river (MUC 1) and one specimen from the Mondego river (MUC 46 B) ], as well as ®ve specimens captured in the Guadalquivir river in the 1940 s but not preserved (CM 1, CM 2, CM 3, CM 4 and CM 5), were identi®ed as A. naccarii. After cloning and character- isation of a satellite-DNA family, HindIII, from A. naccarii genome, its absence from the genome of A. sturio was determined. Using this satellite-DNA as a genetic marker and by means of dot-blotting, we dem- onstrate that the DNA of the two specimens captured during the mid- 1970 s in the Guadalquivir river cross- hybridised with HindIII satellite-DNA sequences of A. naccarii.

40|$|Four {{sturgeon}} {{species have}} been reported to exist in Greek waters: the Atlantic sturgeon, the great sturgeon, the stellate sturgeon and the Adriatic sturgeon. The Atlantic <b>sturgeon</b> <b>Acipenser</b> sturio L., 1758 has an almost regular presence in the Evros River (Aegean Sea), and is rather rare in the Pinios and Acheloos Rivers. The great sturgeon or beluga Huso huso L., 1758 is suspected to be an occasional visitor in Greek waters, or it is a case of undocumented information. The presence of the stellate <b>sturgeon</b> <b>Acipenser</b> stellatus Pallas, 1771 has been recently verified by a specimen caught close to the Thracian shore. The Adriatic <b>sturgeon</b> <b>Acipenser</b> naccarii Bonaparte, 1836 is supposed to have its southern distribution limits in the waters around the island of Corfu, although this information has never been confirmed. The distribution of these species is obvi-ously related to salinity, probably prohibiting the extension of other sturgeon species to the Mediterranean, except for A. sturio. The discontinuous distribution of H. huso and A. stellatus may be a result of sea-level changes, while salinity played some role in the last period of glaciation. In the marine area of the Evros River A. sturio has been economically significant until 1975, sup-porting a small black caviar industry. Since then, the species has become rare mainly because of overfishing, and the reduction and pollution of the Evros River, in the upstream of which some important sturgeon spawning sites have been located...|$|R
