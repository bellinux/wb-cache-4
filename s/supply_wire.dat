50|$|For older K&T installations, {{the supply}} and return wires were not {{necessarily}} installed as a pair, and did not necessarily have to be near each other at all. From the fusebox, a single <b>supply</b> <b>wire</b> {{would go to the}} first switch. From there, it would divide into two switching wires. At the second, remote switch the two wires would come together to be a single <b>supply</b> <b>wire</b> again. Finally this <b>supply</b> <b>wire</b> would be routed from the second switch to the light fixture, and then a single return wire would take the shortest path through the building back to the fusebox. The foregoing {{is an example of the}} so-called Carter system wire layout.|$|E

50|$|Electric kettles were {{introduced}} {{as a means}} to boil water without the necessity of a stove top. They are normally constructed of durable plastic or steel (with a plastic handle) and powered by mains electricity. In modern kettles, the heating element is typically fully enclosed, with a power rating of 2-3 kW at 220V. In countries with 110V mains electricity, kettles may be less powerful (1-1.5 kW) to avoid drawing too much current and requiring a very thick <b>supply</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E

50|$|An example {{might be}} a 27 MHz Citizen's band radio in a car, {{connected}} to the car's 12 volt DC supply. If the decoupling capacitors which bypass radio noise from the power <b>supply</b> <b>wires</b> are missing or inadequate, or the long power leads pick up excessive RF from the antenna then {{it is possible for}} the RF transmitter signal to enter the radio's receiving circuits through the <b>supply</b> <b>wires.</b> This then causes the motorboating to occur.|$|R

50|$|For example, {{consider}} {{the installation of}} a light, controlled by two switches in different locations. In modern practice, the supply and return wires both arrive at the first switch, where the supply is connected {{to one of the}} two switching wires (hot/red); the return wire is carried inside the same multi-conductor cable to the distant second switch. From there, a <b>supply</b> <b>wire</b> carries power to the light, and a return wire goes back to location of the second switch, and then retraces the path back to the fusebox.|$|E
5000|$|Eastern Market {{was badly}} damaged by an early-morning 3-alarm fire on April 30, 2007. The {{heaviest}} damage {{was in the}} South Hall of the market, the portion occupied by vendors' stalls, where the roof suffered a partial collapse. The Washington Post has described the South Hall as [...] "gutted so badly that birds can now fly in through the front windows and out the back ones." [...] Following the fire, Washington D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty promised to rebuild the market. The outdoor weekend market was disrupted but never closed. Many of the food vendors re-opened for business within weeks of the fire, selling their products outside of the building. In August 2007, the city completed a temporary market annex, known as the [...] "East Hall," [...] {{on the opposite side}} of 7th Street, on the grounds of Hine Junior High School. This housed the vendors until the reopening of the market building, with a ribbon-cutting on June 26, 2009. The Washington, D.C., Fire and Emergency Services Department determined officially that the fire originated outside of the Eastern Market between a dumpster and the exterior of the west wall, and that the fire was caused by an electrical failure on the electric <b>supply</b> <b>wire</b> for a nearby trash compactor. However, former D.C. fire investigators Gerald Pennington and Greg Bowyer have suggested the fire was deliberately set by suspect Joel Ramos.|$|E

The Bulk-to-SOI migration has been recently explored, even considering the improvements and drawbacks related to SOI, including low power advantages of this technology and low thermal properties as well.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in high-speed train transportation systems is to counteract the fast variations of the contact force between the catenary and the pantograph collector end. The variation of the catenary equivalent stiffness, due to the suspending system, originates mechanical oscillations whose frequency and magnitude are larger and larger as the train speed increases. Such oscillations cause electric arcs that damage the mechanical structure and compromise {{the collection of the}} current from the <b>supply</b> <b>wire,</b> degradating the overall performance. Active pantographs offer the possibility of affecting the contact force evolution by suitably modifying the control torque applied to the lower arm of the pantograph. We consider the equivalent stiffness of the catenary as an uncertainty to compensate for by suitable robust control techniques, and, under the assumption that a noisy measurement of the contact force is available, we propose an output feedback control scheme based on higher-order sliding modes and high-gain observers. That combination allows for an almost complete rejection of the undesired oscillations of the contact force, as confirmed by simulations, and it is very attractive for real-time implementation purposes, due to its simplicity and robusteness...|$|E
40|$|Manufacturers {{increase}} {{the use of}} electrical and electronic components {{in all kinds of}} products to provide new functions, improve performance and reduce the operational and development costs. The counterpart is the introduction of new constraints such as the electromagnetic vulnerability where the equipment functioning can be disturbed by electromagnetic effect. The perturbation can happen in various conditions: (1) Inside an electrical harness between power <b>supply</b> <b>wire</b> and command wire; (2) Between electrical harnesses; (3) Or because of external sources (electrical equipment, engines, Wi-Fi etc.) or natural ones like lightening. This concerns machine design, robotic assembly lines, devices for commercial buildings and public facilities, embedded systems (aircraft, trains, boats, tramways, drones), and in general, all automatic devices and electrical systems. To reduce the time to market, manufacturers need tools able to: (1) Detect bad electromagnetic effects as soon as possible: before prototyping, during the design phase; (2) Avoid cable shielding when it is not necessary: lighter equipment, less manufacture operations (welding). An electromagnetic simulator, integrated into an electrical CAD software suite, used during the design phase, on a simple PC connected to HPC, would allow the manufacturers to adapt the design to electromagnetic constraints before building the first prototype. As of today, they generally identify the problems during testing phase, if not on the customer site during the installation with all consequences behind that...|$|E

50|$|The main {{function}} of an LISN {{is to provide}} a precise impedance to the power input of the EUT, in order to get repeatable measurements of the EUT noise present at the LISN measurement port.

5000|$|One {{common cause}} is {{feedback}} through the plate power supply circuit. [...] The power supply provides DC current to each tube's plate circuit, so the power <b>supply</b> <b>wiring</b> (power busses) {{can be an}} inadvertent feedback path between stages. The increasing impedance of the filter capacitors at low frequencies can mean that low frequency swings in the current drawn by output stages can cause voltage swings in the power supply voltage which feed back to earlier stages, making the system a subaudio oscillator. This is caused by inadequate power supply filtering or decoupling. The electrolytic capacitors used in equipment of 1960s vintage contained liquid electrolyte, which dried out over decades, decreasing the capacitance and increasing the leakage current, and these are often the cause.|$|R
