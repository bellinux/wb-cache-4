5|$|The {{festivals and}} daily rituals do not adhere to {{standard}} Hindu Agamic or Buddhist rituals. It follows what Paul Younger calls as ancient Vedda traditions of worship. Although since the medieval period Hindus, Buddhists and even Muslims {{have tried to}} co-opt the temple, deity and its worship as their own, the rituals maintained by the native priests are still intact. The main festival known in Sinhalese as Esela Perehera. It is celebrated during the months of July and August. About 45 days before the festival begins, the priests go into the forest and find two forked branches of a sacred tree. The branches are then immersed in the local river and kept at the shrines dedicated to Kataragama deviyo and Vali. When the main festival begins, the Yantra representing the deity is retrieved from its <b>storage</b> <b>location,</b> paraded through a street {{on top of an}} elephant, and carried to the Valli shrine. After two hours it is returned. On {{the last day of the}} festival the Yantra is left overnight at the Valli shrine and brought back to the main shrine. The priests conduct the rituals in silence, covering their mouths with white cloth. Associated with the main festival is fire walking arranged by a master of the ritual. Hundreds of devotees participate in fire walking, yet others participate in ecstatic dance forms called Kavadi and body piercing. Many of the pilgrims exhibit signs of being possessed.|$|E

The <b>storage</b> <b>locations</b> are accessible by operating vehicles (8) over {{a set of}} horizontal planes (6, 7). The operating vehicles are movable over rails in longitudinal and transverse directions. A movable, ramp, a conveyor and a vertical lift are provided between the horizontal storage planes. Locking and unlocking devices are provided in the <b>storage</b> <b>locations.</b> The <b>storage</b> <b>locations</b> are lifted and lowered by a lifting mechanism. USE - Storage system {{for use in a}} material flow system or logistic system for accommodation of goods e. g. pallets and storage containers, in <b>storage</b> <b>locations</b> accessible by operating vehicles i. e. staplers. ADVANTAGE - The <b>storage</b> <b>locations</b> are accessible by the operating vehicles over the horizontal planes, thus ensuring highly flexible storage and distribution of goods and utilization of the vehicles, which can approach <b>storage</b> <b>locations</b> independent of each other. The design of the storage system does not require a complex preliminary zone, and avoids travel time from the preliminary zone to the processing places, thus increasing performance of the logistic system...|$|R

The ideal <b>storage</b> <b>location</b> for sacred artifacts and human remains is a designated space away {{from the rest of}} the collection; however, there are often many constraints which prevent this from being possible.

25|$|The {{idea was}} to build an {{offshore}} terminal with docks equipped with Dashaveyor tracks instead of a conventional container shipping port on land. An operator would load containers onto Dashaveyor cars, which would then enter a tunnel to move them at high speed to the shore. There they would exit the tunnel and automatically drive the container to its <b>storage</b> <b>location,</b> and optionally lift it to stack them. In a Dashaveyor equipped port, a single vehicle would pick up, move and stack the containers. Normally each of these steps required a separate, manned, vehicle. Additionally, the ships never had to enter port, which had major advantages in terms of siting and construction.|$|E
25|$|As the {{accumulated}} {{water in the}} basement (see the tunnel below diagram #2) of the turbine building of Units 2 and 3 was radioactive, TEPCO needed to remove it. They had initially planned to pump the water to the condenser (the large black vessel in diagram #1). However, TEPCO had to abandon that plan after discovering that the condensers on both units were already full of water. Pumps capable of processing 1025 tons of water per hour were used to transfer condenser water into other storage tanks, freeing up condenser storage for {{the water in the}} basements. However, since both the storage tanks and the condensers were nearly full, TEPCO also considered using floating tankers ships as a temporary <b>storage</b> <b>location</b> for the radioactive water. Regardless of the availability of offshore storage for radioactive-contaminated water, TEPCO decided to discharge 11,500 tons of its least contaminated water (with was still approximately 100 times the legal limit for radioactivity) to the sea on April 5 in order to free up storage space. At the same time, on 5 April, TEPCO began pumping water from the condensers of units 1–3 to their respective condensation storage tanks to free room for the trench water (see below).|$|E

500|$|The {{assignment}} statement (token '=', the equals sign). This operates differently than in traditional imperative programming languages, and this fundamental mechanism (including {{the nature of}} Python's version of variables) illuminates many other features of the language. Assignment in C, e.g., x = 2, translates to [...] "typed variable name x receives a copy of numeric value 2". The (right-hand) value is copied into an allocated <b>storage</b> <b>location</b> for which the (left-hand) variable name is the symbolic address. The memory allocated to the variable is large enough (potentially quite large) for the declared type. In the simplest case of Python assignment, using the same example, x = 2, translates to [...] "(generic) name x receives {{a reference to a}} separate, dynamically allocated object of numeric (int) type of value 2." [...] This is termed binding the name to the object. Since the name's <b>storage</b> <b>location</b> doesn't contain the indicated value, it is improper to call it a variable. Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types, including strings, procedures, complex objects with data and methods, etc. Successive assignments of a common value to multiple names, e.g., x = 2; y = 2; z = 2 result in allocating storage to (at most) three names and one numeric object, to which all three names are bound. Since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed data type with it. However at a given time a name will be bound to some object, which will have a type; thus there is dynamic typing.|$|E
