50|$|Today {{the term}} has become {{restricted}} to the person or the operator of the machinery which removes sheep's wool or the hair of other animals from hides in preparation for tanning.The process of fellmongering {{has to be done}} quickly after the animal is slaughtered to prevent the hides from decaying before tanning can begin. First they are trimmed of all unwanted pieces like legs, neck and tail then soaked in water to allow the skin tissues to distend. Next, a sodium sulfide solution is applied to the skin side of the fleece. The <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> soaks through the skin and destroys the follicles of the wool roots so that the fellmonger can then separate the wool from the skins. The wool is washed and dried. The skins are then soaked in a stronger solution of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> and lime for 21 hours to remove small clumps of wool missed by the puller and to break down some internal proteins within the skin. The next process is called deliming: the skins are soaked in a solution of water and ammonium sulfate. This is to remove all the <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> from the skin and degraded proteins. The next process is the bating which is to remove any remaining protein from the surface.|$|E
5000|$|The {{material}} {{fed into}} the digester must be small enough to allow the pulping liquor to penetrate the pieces completely. In the case of wood, the logs are chipped and the chips screened so that what is fed to the digester is a uniform size. The oversize chips are rechipped or used as fuel, sawdust is burned. The screened chips or cut plant material (bamboo, kenaf, etc.) goes to the digester where it is mixed an aqueous solution of the pulping chemicals, then heated with steam. In the kraft process the pulping chemicals are sodium hydroxide and <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> and the solution is known as white liquor. In the sulfite process the pulping chemical {{is a mixture of}} metal (sodium, magnesium, potassium or calcium) or ammonium sulfite or sulphite. After several hours in the digester, the chips or cut plant material breaks down into a thick porridge-like consistency and is [...] "blown" [...] or squeezed from the outlet of the digester through an airlock. The sudden change in pressure results in a rapid expansion of the fibres, separating the fibres even more. The resulting fibre suspension in water solution is called [...] "brown stock".|$|E

AIMS: To assess the reversal of the damaging effect of sulphide to isolated colonocytes by methionine and methionine derivatives. METHODS AND SUBJECTS: Isolated colonocytes were prepared from rat colons and 12 human colectomy specimens.

40|$|The use of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> as an {{ingredient}} in the depilatory paint employed in the fellmongering of sheepskin is now almost universal. The <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphide</b> is in aqueous solution and is customarily thickened by the suspension of slaked lime in the solution, sufficient lime being added to make a paint which will adhere easily to the skin.

It is recognised that care is necessary in the making up of this paint.

30|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} plants (WWTP) represent habitats of continuous change in chemical composition (Szczepanowski et al. 2008).

40|$|PHOSPHOLIPASE A 2 : A NEW TARGET FOR HYDROGEN SULFIDE ACTIVITY CHAPTER 1 Hydrogen {{sulphide}} (H 2 S), a novel gaseous transmitter, {{is considered}} a physiological regulator of vascular homeostasis. Recent evidence suggests H 2 S is an endothelium hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) candidate. To address this issue, we evaluated the vascular effect of <b>sodium</b> hydrogen <b>sulphide</b> (NaHS), an H 2 S donor on the rat mesenteric arterial bed. A NaHS concentration-response curve was performed on pre-constricted mesenteric arterial bed. In order to asses the contribute of EDHF, we performed a pharmacological dissection using indomethacin, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or apamin and charibdotoxin, as cyclooxygenase, nitric oxide synthase and calcium-dependent potassium channel inhibitors, respectively. In another set of experiments we used 4 -(4 -Octadecylphenyl) - 4 -oxobutenoic acid, baicalein or proadifen as PLA 2, lipoxygenase and P 450 cytochrome inhibitors respectively. Finally, in an immunofluorescence study we evaluated the involvement of PLA 2 in the NaHS-induced effect on the mesenteric artery. NaHS promoted a dual vascular effect, i. e., vasoconstriction and vasodilation. L-NAME administration did not affect NaHS-mediated vasodilation nor vasoconstriction, whereas apamin and charibdotoxin significantly inhibited NaHS-induced relaxation. Pre-treatment with PLA 2 inhibitor abolished both the contracting and the relaxant effect, whereas P 450 cytochrome blocker, significantly reduced NaHS-mediated relaxation. The immunofluorescence study showed that NaHS caused a migration of cPLA 2 close to the nucleus, which implies activation of this enzyme. Our data indicate that H 2 S could activate PLA 2 that in turn releases arachidonic acid leading, initially, to vasoconstriction followed by vasodilation mediated by cytochrome P 450 -derived metabolites. As EDHF has been presumed to be a cytochrome P 450 derivative of the arachidonic acid, our results suggest H 2 S {{as a candidate for}} EDHF. CHAPTER 2 Background and purpose: Hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S), considered as a novel gas transmitter, is produced endogenously in mammalian tissue from L-cysteine by two enzymes cystathionine β- synthase (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE). Recently, {{it has been reported that}} H 2 S contributes to the local and systemic inflammation in several experimental animal models. We conducted this study to investigate on the signaling involved in H 2 S induced inflammation. Experimental approach: L-cysteine or <b>sodium</b> hydrogen <b>sulphide</b> (NaHS) were injected in the mouse hind paw and oedema formation was evaluated for 60 min. In order to investigate on the H 2 S–induced oedema formation, we used different pharmacological tools: serotonin and histamine receptor antagonists, KATP channels or arachidonic acid cascade inhibitors. Prostaglandin levels were determined in hind paw exudates by radioimmunoassay. Finally, the histological analysis was performed on L-cisteine injected hind paw. Key results: Both NaHS and L-cysteine caused oedema formation characterized by a fast onset which peaked at 30 minutes. This oedematogenic action was not associated with histamine, serotonin release or KATP channel activation. Conversely, the oedema formation was significantly inhibited by ciclooxygenase and phospholipase A 2 selective inhibitors. Moreover, the prostaglandin levels were significantly increased in exudates of hind paw injected with NaHS or L-cysteine. The histological study clearly showed an inflammatory state with a loss of tissue organization. Conclusion and implication: We could assume that the phospholipase A 2 and prostaglandins production are involved in H 2 S pro-inflammatory effect in the mouse hind paw. The present study could contribute to understand the role of L-cysteine/H 2 S pathway in inflammatory disease...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sodium</b> {{hydrogen}} <b>sulphide</b> (NaHS), a donor {{of hydrogen}} sulphide (H 2 S), produced dose-related relaxation of the rabbit isolated ileum (EC 50, 76. 4 ± 7. 9 μM) and rat vas deferens (EC 50, 64. 8 ± 5. 4 μM) and reduced ACh-mediated contraction of the guinea-pig isolated ileum. NaHS also reduced {{the response of}} the guinea-pig (EC 50, 80. 0 ± 5. 7 μM) and rat (EC 50, 108. 2 ± 11. 2 μM) ileum preparations to electrical stimulation of the intramural nerves. In guinea-pig ileum this effect was spontaneously reversible and mimicked by sodium nitroprusside (SNP, EC 50, 2. 1 μM). Combination of NaHS (20 μM) with SNP (0. 5 μM) produced a greater than additive inhibition of the twitch response of the ileum to electrical stimulation. The inhibitory effect of NaHS on the field-stimulated guinea-pig ileum was unaffected by pretreatment with L-NAME (100 μM), indomethacin (10 μM), naloxone (1 μM) or glibenclamide (100 μM). Furthermore, NaHS (200 μM) did not affect the contractile response of the ileum to KCl (10 to 60 mM). Propargylglycine (PAG, 1 mM) and β-cyanoalanine (BCA, 1 mM) (inhibitors of cystathionine-γ-lyase) but not aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA, 1 mM) (inhibitor of cystathionine-β-synthetase) caused a slowly developing increase in the contraction of the guinea-pig ileum to field stimulation. This effect was reversed by cysteine (1 mM). These results show that NaHS relaxes gastrointestinal and urogenital smooth muscle and suggest that H 2 S is responsible for these effects. The possibility that endogenous H 2 S, formed as a consequence of activation of intramural nerves, plays a part in controlling the contractility of the guinea-pig ileum is discussed...|$|R

Metabolic performance was assessed by 14 CO 2 production and by acyl-CoA ester production measured by HPLC with ultraviolet detection. RESULTS: Results are given as mean (SEM). For colonocytes incubated in the presence of exogenous CoA and ATP, treatment with NaHS significantly diminished 14 CO 2 production (control 0. 97 (0. 06) mumol/g dry weight cells/min, treated 0. 26 (0. 09) mumol/g dry weight cells/min, p = 0. 0019), was associated with an increase in butyryl-CoA concentrations in the final reaction mixture at 10 minutes (control 2. 55 (0. 28) mumol/g dry weight cells, treated 3. 32 (0. 32) mumol/g dry weight cells, p = 0. 002), and a reduction in crotonyl-CoA concentrations (control 0. 274 (0. 02) mumol/g dry weight cells, treated 0. 120 (0. 04) mumol/g dry weight cells, p = 0. 008).

The results indicated that the type of impurities determined the surface tension changes of the amine solution. The concentration of piperazine-MDEA blends also enhanced to the increasing of surface tension. Iron <b>sulphide,</b> hydrocarbons and <b>sodium</b> chloride as the impurities in the amine solution were the most influential factors to the surface tension. Statistical experimental method was employed to determine the main effect in the increasing of surface tension. Full factorial design and response surface methodology (RSM) coupled with central composite design (CCD) were used to determine the increasing of surface tension in the amine solution. A central composite design was used to determine the main variables such as iron <b>sulphide,</b> hydrocarbon and <b>sodium</b> chloride. The maximum surface tension of 74. 33 mNm- 1 was determined at the combined impurities concentrations of Iron Sulphide at 6. 346 ppm, Hydrocarbon liquids at 11. 827 ppm and Sodium Chloride at 8. 261 ppm...|$|R
40|$|Ulcerative colitis is {{associated}} with a selective reduction of n-butyrate oxidation by the colonic epithelial cells although the reason for this has been unclear. Colonic epithelial cell n-butyrate oxidation can be inhibited in vitro by incubation with sulphide but the role of mucosal detoxification of sulphide in the metabolic welfare of the colonic mucosa has not been examined. This study aimed to assess the role mucosal detoxification of sulphide by thiolmethyltransferase (TMT) -mediated methylation may play in protecting the healthy colonic mucosa from the adverse effects of luminal sulphide. Colonic epithelial cell suspensions from healthy human proximal (n = 9) and distal colon (n = 10) were incubated in the presence of 14 C-labelled n-butyrate (5 mmol/L) alone, butyrate plus <b>sodium</b> hydrogen <b>sulphide</b> (NaHS) (1. 5 mmol/L), or butyrate plus NaHS plus S-adenosyl-methionine 1, 4 butane disulphonate (SAMe) (5 mmol/L). Study end points were metabolic performance (14 CO 2 production) and mucosal TMT activity. Incubation with NaHS induced a significant inhibition of 14 CO 2 production compared with control incubations (P < 0. 001) which was similar for proximal and distal colonic cell suspensions. S-adenosyl-methionine 1, 4 butane disulphonate reversed this effect completely in proximal but not in distal cell incubations, suggesting a greater susceptibility of the distal colon to the sulphide effect. Although median whole mucosal TMT values did not differ between proximal and distal colonic mucosa, a non-normal distribution of distal TMT values was observed. However, neither the degree of sulphide inhibition of control 14 CO 2 production nor the degree to which SAMe reversed this inhibition correlated with whole mucosal TMT activity. The study concluded that regional variation exists in TMT activity in the human colon but whilst methylation appears to protect colonic epithelial cells against sulphide-induced inhibition of n-butyrate oxidation, this cannot be directly correlated with mucosal TMT activity.

40|$|Abstract only. There are {{a number}} of {{intrinsic}} and extrinsic factors which affect the normal routine activity of the prawn. The present study attempts to elucidate the optimum levels of various environmental factors for the culture of prawns. The salinity tolerance capacity of Penaeus (Melicertus) latisulcatus was estimated in 13 different test salinities from 0 to 60 ppt (at 5 ppt increments). The prawns can tolerate a wide salinity range of 20 - 50 ppt. Maximum survival, however, was between 25 to 45 ppt. The extreme low (0 - 10 ppt) and high (60 ppt) salinities were highly lethal to the prawns. The change in acclimation temperature from 30 to 35 Â°C increased the upper incipient lethal level from 38. 5 to 39. 5 Â°C. The prawns acclimated to 30 Â°C tolerated 42 Â°C for 275 sec and 45. 5 Â°C for 13 sec, while prawns acclimated to 35 Â°C tolerated 42 Â°C for 505 sec and 46. 5 Â°C for 11 sec. Prawns were acclimated to a salinity of 26 ppt and oxygen consumption was measured at 5, 15, 26, and 38 ppt in a continuous water-flow method. The total oxygen consumption showed an inverse relationship with weight. Oxygen consumption declined with increase in salinity.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the influence of}} dietary fermentable protein (fCP) and fermentable carbohydrates (fCHO) on the colonic epithelial response to histamine in pigs. Thirty-two weaned piglets were fed 4 diets in a 2 × 2 factorial design with low fCP/low fCHO, low fCP/high fCHO, high fCP/low fCHO and high fCP/high fCHO. After 21 - 23 days, the pigs were killed and tissue from the proximal colon was stimulated with carbachol, histamine, PGE 2 or <b>sodium</b> hydrogen <b>sulphide</b> in Ussing chambers. Changes in short-circuit current and tissue conductance were measured. Diamine oxidase, histamine N-methyltransferase, stem cell growth factor receptor, Fc-epsilon receptor I and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene expression was determined. Activities of diamine oxidase and histamine N-methyltransferase and numbers of colonic mast cells were measured. The change in the short-circuit current in response to histamine was lower (P = 0. 002) and tended to be lower for PGE 2 (P = 0. 053) in high fCP groups compared to low fCP groups, irrespective of fCHO. Additionally, the change in tissue conductance after the application of histamine was lower (P = 0. 005) in the high fCP groups. The expression of histamine N-methyltransferase mRNA (P = 0. 033) and the activities of diamine oxidase (P = 0. 001) and histamine N-methyltransferase (P = 0. 006) were higher with high fCP in comparison with low fCP. The expression of mast cell markers, stem cell growth factor receptor (P = 0. 005) and Fc-epsilon receptor I (P = 0. 049) was higher with high fCP diets compared to diets low in fCP, whereas the mast cell count did not differ between groups. The expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator was reduced (P = 0. 001) with high fCP diets compared to low fCP diets. The lower epithelial response to histamine and PGE 2 and elevated epithelial histamine inactivation suggests an adaptation to high fCP diets...|$|R
40|$|Background H 2 S is endogenously {{produced}} from l-cysteine (L-cys) by {{the action of}} three key enzymes cysthationine β-synthase (CBS), cysthationine-γ-lyase (CSE) and the newly discovered 3 -mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3 -MST) [1] and [2]. It is present in human blood at micromolar concentrations [3] and it is involved in the maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis [4]. To date, the influence of H 2 S on platelets, which {{play a central role in}} blood homeostasis, has been poorly explored. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of H 2 S signaling in human platelets. Methods Human washed platelets were collected from 15 healthy volunteers. The expression of both CBS, CSE and 3 -MST was evaluated by Western blot analysis. The enzymes activity was evaluated through H 2 S measurement by a colorimetric assay [5]. Light transmission aggregometry technique was used to analyze platelet aggregation. H 2 S-induced effect was evaluated using both an exogenous source of H 2 S, <b>sodium</b> hydrogen <b>sulphide</b> (NaHS, 0. 1 μM– 10 mM) and the metabolic precursor, L-cys (0. 1 μM– 10 mM) on thrombin receptor activator peptide 6 amide (TRAP- 6, 2 μM) stimulus. We operated a pharmacological modulation by using specific inhibitors of arachidonic acid cascade, the main pathway involved in platelet function. Indomethacin (INDO, 10 μM, 15 min), a COX inhibitor, arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF 3, 1 μM, 15 min), a phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) inhibitor or SQ 29548 (1 μM), a thromboxane receptor antagonist were used. In addition, thromboxane (TXA 2) and cAMP levels were evaluated. Results Human washed platelets expressed CBS, CSE and 3 -MST and generated detectable amounts of H 2 S. Incubation with L-cys significantly increased H 2 S release (p < 0. 001). Neither L-cys nor NaHS (0. 1 μM– 10 mM) affected human washed platelets in resting conditions, but both significantly increased TRAP- 6 -induced aggregation (p < 0. 001 for L-cys 0. 1 mM and NaHS 0. 1 mM and 10 μM; p < 0. 01 for NaHS 1 μM and p < 0. 05 for L-cys 10 μM). Besides, H 2 S did not modify platelet cAMP levels. Conversely, INDO, AACOCF 3 and SQ 29548 blocked the potentiating effect of H 2 S on platelet aggregation induced by TRAP- 6. Interestingly, both NaHS and L-cys induced a significantly increase in TXA 2 production (p < 0. 01). Conclusions Our data imply that the H 2 S endogenously produced within human platelets is involved in platelet aggregation through PLA 2 activation. These findings may open a new pharmacological approache in platelet dependent disorders...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{sulphide}} (H 2 S) {{is emerging}} as an important endogenous mediator produced in various mammalian tissues from L-Cysteine {{by the actions of}} cysthationine β-synthase (CBS) and/or cysthationine-γ-lyase (CSE), which are expressed in tissue specific fashion (Zhao et al. 2001). H 2 S exerts physiological and pathological effects in many organs and systems, but attention has been focused mainly on the cardiovascular system. It is now well established that H 2 S is involved in vascular homeostasis, for example regulating blood pressureand producing biphasic effects in the regulation of vascular tone (Yang et al., 2008; d’Emmanuele di Villa Bianca et al., 2011; Lim et al. 2008). Evidence for the role(s) of H 2 S in platelets is still lacking. Here, we first evaluated the effect of H 2 S on human platelets and then we investigated the possible pathways involved. We evaluated the presence of both CBS and CSE by western blot analysis, and used an H 2 S quantification assay to assess CBS and CSE activity. In order to look at influences on platelet reactivity, human washed platelets were collected from healthy volunteers; thrombin receptor activator peptide 6 amide (TRAP- 6, 2 µM) was used in presence or absence of <b>sodium</b> hydrogen <b>sulphide</b> (NaHS, 0. 1 µM – 10 mM), as an H 2 S donor, or L-Cysteine, as an H 2 S precursor (0. 1 µM – 10 mM). D-Cysteine was used as negative control. These experiments were repeated in the presence of aminoxyacetic acid (AOAA, 1 mM, 15 min) or propargylglycine (PGG, 1 mM, 15 min), CBS and CSE inhibitors, respectively. In order to assess possible mechanism(s) underlying the effects of H 2 S, we measured cAMP levels and evaluated the effects of either indomethacin (INDO, 10 µM, 15 min),a COX inhibitor, or arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF 3, 1 µM, 15 min), a PLA­ 2 inhibitor. Western blot demonstrated the presence of both CBS and CSE in human platelets. L-Cysteine, but not D-Cysteine, significantly increased H 2 S production (p< 0. 001), and this effect was significantly reduced by either PGG or AOAA (p< 0. 001 and p< 0. 01, respectively). Neither L-Cysteine nor NaHS (both 0. 1 µM – 10 mM) affected human washed platelets in resting conditions, but both significantly increased aggregations induced by TRAP- 6 amide (p< 0. 001 for L-Cys 0. 1 mM and NaHS 0. 1 mM and 10 µM; p< 0. 05 for L-Cys 10 µM and NaHS 1 µM), effects that were completely abolished by pre-treatment with PGG or AOAA. H 2 S did not affect platelet cAMP levels. On the other hand, both INDO and AACOCF 3 blocked the potentiating effects of H 2 S on platelet aggregation. In conclusion, our data suggest that H 2 S is endogenously produced within human platelets and is involved in platelet aggregation through PLA 2 activation. These findings may highlight new targets for the development of interventions in platelet dependent disorders. d’Emmanuele di Villa Bianca (2011) J Pharmacol Exp Ther (in press).
