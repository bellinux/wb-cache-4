50|$|<b>Shock</b> <b>testing</b> {{typically}} {{falls into}} two categories, classical <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> and pyroshock or ballistic <b>shock</b> <b>testing.</b> Classical <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> {{consists of the}} following shock impulses: half sine, haversine, sawtooth wave, and trapezoid. Pyroshock and ballistic shock tests are specialized and are not considered classical shocks. Classical shocks can be performed on Electro Dynamic (ED) Shakers, Free Fall Drop Tower or Pneumatic Shock Machines. A classical shock impulse is created when the shock machine table changes direction abruptly. This abrupt change in direction causes a rapid velocity change which creates the shock impulse.|$|E

40|$|Mechanical <b>shock</b> <b>tests</b> {{are very}} {{important}} for portable electronic products such as notebook computers and mobile phones because these products are subjected to high risks of impact loading. Impact loading often plays {{a critical role in}} the functional performance and mechanical reliability of electronic components and devices. Drop tests are adopted usually to the overall product to assess the structural and functional integrity. Traditional test method is to drop the products from a certain height with a quick release hook or drop tester. The obvious advantage for these methods is that they can directly duplicate the field impact scenarios. However, the test repeatability can not be guarantied in drop tests, because it is difficult to control the orientation of the object at impact and to instrument it. Moreover; by considering the real impact conditions, drop tests are not applicable for the <b>shock</b> reliability <b>tests</b> of individual components. <b>Shock</b> table <b>tests</b> are carried out to overcome the drawbacks described above. A shock impulse with a given shape, magnitude and duration is applied to the shock table and then imparted to the sample product or component fasted to the table. However, the <b>shock</b> table <b>test</b> is a simulation of the real-life drop impact process. To make the <b>shock</b> table <b>tests</b> adequately mimic the real drop impact, it is critical to make correlation between the <b>shock</b> table <b>test</b> parameter and field conditions. The present paper aims to conduct a systematic study, both experimentally and analytically, to evaluate the feasibility of using appropriate <b>shock</b> table <b>tests</b> to mimic the shock environment for components and systems adopted in portable electronics. Firstly, dynamic characteristics of typical portable electronic systems and components under drop impact are studied, and then effective <b>shock</b> table <b>test</b> methods are developed for adequately mimic the real-life impact state. At last, by comparing the typical results from <b>shock</b> table <b>tests</b> and those from drop tests, the correlation of <b>shock</b> table <b>test</b> parameters and drop tests conditions are investigated. ...|$|R
