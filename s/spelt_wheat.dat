40|$|The {{nutritional}} value of breadmaking cereal spelt (Triticum aestivum ssp. spelta) {{is said to}} be higher than that of common wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. vulgare), but this traditional view is not substantiated by scientific evidence. In an attempt to clarify this issue, wholemeal and milling fractions (sieved flour, fine bran, and coarse bran) from nine dehulled spelt and five soft winter wheat samples were compared with regard to their lipid, fatty acid, and mineral contents. In addition, tocopherol (a biochemical marker of germ) was measured in all wholemeals, whereas phytic acid and phosphorus levels were determined in fine bran and coarse bran samples after 1 month of storage. Results showed that, on average, spelt wholemeals and milling fractions were higher in lipids and unsaturated fatty acids as compared to wheat, whereas tocopherol content was lower in spelt, suggesting that the higher lipid content of spelt may not be related to a higher germ proportion. Although milling fractionation produced similar proportions of flour and brans in <b>spelt</b> and <b>wheat,</b> it was found that ash, copper, iron, zinc, magnesium, and phosphorus contents were higher in spelt samples, especially in aleurone-rich fine bran and in coarse bran. Even though phosphorus content was higher in <b>spelt</b> than in <b>wheat</b> brans, phytic acid content showed the opposite trend and was 40 % lower in <b>spelt</b> versus <b>wheat</b> fine bran, which may suggest that spelt has either a higher endogenous phytase activity or a lower phytic acid content than wheat. The results of this study give important indications on the real {{nutritional value}} of <b>spelt</b> compared to <b>wheat.</b> Moreover, they show that the Ca/Fe ratio, combined with that of oleate/palmitate, provides a highly discriminating tool to authenticate <b>spelt</b> from <b>wheat</b> flours and to face the growing issue of spelt flour adulteration. Finally, they suggest that aleurone differences, the nature of which still needs to be investigated, may account for the differential nutrient composition of <b>spelt</b> and <b>wheat...</b>|$|R

The extended scale allowed the monitoring of development during the 3 - 4 weeks following flag leaf emergence and was sensitive enough to reveal a differences at daily intervals.

40|$|ISI Document Delivery No. : 035 MX Times Cited: 2 Grain {{protein content}} in wheat {{has been shown}} to be {{affected}} by the NAM-B 1 gene where the wildtype allele confers high levels of protein and micronutrients but can reduce yield. Two known non-functional alleles instead increase yield but lead to lower levels of protein and micronutrients. The wildtype allele in hexaploid bread wheat is so far mainly known from historical specimens and a few lines with an emmer wheat introgression. Here we report a screening for the wildtype allele in wheats of different origin. First, a worldwide core collection of 367 bread wheats with worldwide origin was screened and five accessions carrying the wildtype NAM-B 1 allele were found. Several of these could be traced to a Fennoscandian origin and the wildtype allele was more frequent in spring wheat. These findings, together with the late maturation of spring wheat, suggested that the faster maturation caused by the wildtype allele might have preserved it in areas with a short growing season. Thus a second set consisting of 138 spring wheats of a northern origin was screened and as many as 33 % of the accessions had the wildtype allele, all of a Fennoscandian origin. The presence of the wildtype allele in landraces and cultivars is in agreement with the use of landraces in Fennoscandian wheat breeding. Last, 22 <b>spelt</b> <b>wheats,</b> a wheat type previously suggested to carry the wildtype allele, were screened and five wildtype accessions found.

Dynamics of water acquisition is the same for both hulled and dehulled kernels of <b>spelt</b> <b>wheat,</b> but the difference in water content required for germination leads to different times of this process. Negative influence of hulled kernels on germination is amplified in periods of drought and unfavorable temperatures.

Also, <b>spelt</b> <b>wheat</b> showed much higher tolerance to lower oxygen inflow (hypoxia) in the stressful conditions of very humid and cold soil.
