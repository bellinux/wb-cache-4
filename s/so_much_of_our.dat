500|$|Increasing {{territorial}} {{conflict between}} the Sioux and the Ojibwe on the western frontier, particularly along the Mississippi river, led the U.S. government to attempt to mediate the conflicts. President Andrew Jackson's policy toward the tribes ultimately was to either pacify them sufficiently to allow westward expansion of American settlers, or else remove the tribes from {{the areas in which}} they prevented settlement. The First Treaty of Prairie du Chien (1825), among its provisions established southern Minnesota as well as much of modern North and South Dakota as the homeland of the Dakota Sioux. The Ojibwe were given northern Minnesota and much of Wisconsin. The U.S. government, though, failed to enforce the treaty agreements leading to Little Crow's pronouncement to Indian agent Taliaferro in 1829: [...] "We made peace to please you, but if we are badly off we must blame you for causing us to give up <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> lands to our enemies." ...|$|E

However, since King possessed many of the qualities she liked in a man, she found herself [...] "becoming more involved with every passing moment." [...] When asked by her sister what made King so [...] "appealing" [...] to her she responded, [...] "I suppose it's because Martin reminds me <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> father." [...] At that moment, Scott's sister knew King was [...] "the one." ...|$|E

[...] "Until the late ’60s, the game was a very slow game,” Scates said. [...] "You didn’t try to deceive anybody. You just tried to set a high ball to the outside and if your hitter {{was better than the}} blockers you scored a point. By the late 1960s we started setting very quick here at UCLA. We started running an offense that is still being run today.” Said USC coach Bill Ferguson “He is responsible for <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> sport’s development that we {{will never be able to}} fathom what he did to promote our game. He is the best in-game tactician there ever was.” ...|$|E

He also said that the U.S. was [...] "a great and powerful nation and they are a great and powerful friend." [...] Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said that her government is ready to work with whomever the American people [...] "in their wisdom" [...] choose. She added that a U.S. presidential election is always a momentous occasion and in this instance, [...] "it has been a particularly bruising, divisive and hard-fought campaign." [...] She further said the new administration will face a number of challenges, including in the Asia-Pacific, and Australia wants to work constructively with the new administration to ensure the continued presence and leadership of the United States in the region. She said the U.S. is [...] "our major security ally" [...] and the largest foreign direct investor and the second-largest trading partner. [...] "The United States is also the guarantor and defender of the rules-based international order that has underpinned <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> economic and security issues.

2500|$|Artemisia {{is known}} for her {{portrayal}} of women in positions of power, like her painting Judith Slaying Holofernes. She is also known for the rape trial {{in which she was}} involved, which scholar Griselda Pollock said is now the [...] "axis of interpretation of the artist’s work." [...] Her fame, though great among art historians, is deemed by Pollock to be less due to her work and more to the sensationalism caused by the trial. Feminist literature tends to revolve around the event of Artemisia’s rape, largely portraying her as a traumatized but noble survivor whose work became characterized by sex and violence {{as a result of her}} experience. A literature review by Laura Benedetti, [...] "Reconstructing Artemisia: Twentieth Century Images of a Woman Artist," [...] concluded that Artemisia’s work is often interpreted according to the contemporary issues and personal biases of the authors. Feminist scholars, for example, have elevated Artemisia to the status of feminist icon, which Benedetti attributed to Artemisia’s paintings of formidable women and her success as an artist in a male-dominated field while also being a single mother. Elena Ciletti, author of Gran Macchina a Bellezza, wrote that [...] "The stakes are very high in Artemisia’s case, especially for feminists, because we have invested in her <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> quest for justice for women, historically and currently, intellectually and politically." ...|$|E

30|$|Glass can {{be defined}} as a semitransparent, transparent, non-crystalline and super cold mixture of {{metallic}} silicates. Glass is, therefore, by definition, amorphous or non-crystalline. Glasses are essentially super cooled liquids and they possess a unique combination of properties: transparency with or without colour, durability, electrical and thermal resistance, a range of thermal expansions, with hardness, rigidity and stability density, refractive index (Copley 2001). These properties have been {{the subject matter of the}} various investigations (Jauhari et al. 1974). Specially, density and refractive index of a glass that impart the characterization and forensic individualization of the glass evidence (Gogotsi and Mudrik 2010). Silicate glasses are <b>so</b> <b>much</b> part <b>of</b> <b>our</b> everyday life having a forensic importance (Stoney and Thornton 1985).|$|R
