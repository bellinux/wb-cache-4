40|$|Abstract: The {{traditional}} cyclone with <b>spray</b> <b>scrubber</b> {{was developed}} {{for the removal of}} airborne silica particles from local exhaust ventilation (LEV). The objective of this research is to evaluate the efficiency of this process for removing silica particles in LEV. After designing and installing a traditional cyclone and <b>spray</b> <b>scrubber,</b> air samples were obtained at the inlet and outlet of the apparatus. The mass of each collected sample was determined gravimetrically using EPA method. The efficiency of the cyclone with <b>spray</b> <b>scrubber</b> for the removal of dust particles from the LEV system was determined to be in the range of 92 – 99 %. There was a high correlation between the inlet concentration of dust particles and the efficiency of the apparatus. The total pressure across the system was 772. 17 – 1120. 90 Pa. It was concluded that a traditional cyclone with a <b>spray</b> <b>scrubber</b> can effectively remove a very high percentage of the incoming silica particles from an LEV. The total pressure drop across the current process is less than the pressure drop across other treatment equipment, which means that our process can effectively remove silica particles while using less electricity than other processes.

40|$|A model {{based on}} the {{penetration}} theory has been developed to calculate the dynamic absorption rate of sulfur dioxide into a droplet of limestone slurry. The model includes both instantaneous equilibrium reactions and reactions with finite rates; limestone dissolution, sulfite oxidation, gypsum crystallization and the hydrolysis reaction of CO 2. The model {{has been used to}} quantify the mass transfer within a <b>spray</b> <b>scrubber</b> and to estimate the impact of the reactions with finite rate of the SO 2 mass transfer. The variations within the physical mass transfer conditions of a <b>spray</b> <b>scrubber</b> have been simulated by assuming high mass transfer coefficients close to the nozzles and low coefficients below the spray region. The developed concentration profiles of the diffusing species and the depth of penetration have been determined for different penetration times. The calculations show that the absorption of SO 2 into a limestone <b>spray</b> <b>scrubber</b> to a large extent is liquid-side controlled. Only {{at the very top of}} the absorber, where the partial pressure of SO 2 is low, is the gas film resistance above 50 %. Limestone dissolution close to the gas-liquid interface has been shown to be of significance at low pH and in the parts of the absorber where the internal circulation inside the droplets is low. The impact of the hydrolysis reaction of CO 2 on the absorption rate of SO 2 has been studied by varying the reaction rate constant. Simulations show that the rate constant has a large impact on local absorption rates. Depending on the length of the contact time between the gas and the liquid, the assumption of an instantaneous hydrolysis reaction has an impact on the overall SO 2 absorption rate.

40|$|Water sprays {{and water}} powered {{scrubbers}} {{have both been}} utilized in the mining and milling industry to suppress airborne dust. Unconfined water sprays operated at lower water pressures of ? 689 kPa (? 100 psig) can be very effective at wetting the mine product at the dust source and significantly {{reducing the amount of}} respirable dust that becomes airborne. However, unconfined waters sprays can be somewhat ineffective in actually removing airborne dust from the air. On the other hand, water powered scrubbers operating at higher water pressures of ? 1, 724 kPa (? 250 psig) in physical enclosures or ducts have previously been demonstrated to be very effective in removing airborne dust from the air. These higher operating water pressures are uncommon in many mines and mills, so their use is limited. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recently investigated the performance of a lower-pressure, water powered inline series <b>spray</b> <b>scrubber</b> for removing localized airborne dust emitted at the source. Results showed noticeable improvements in airborne dust capture efficiency through the operation o f multiple inline series hollow cone spray nozzles within a round duct or pipe at the same water pressure as a single spray. Operating hollow cone spray(s) at higher water pressures noticeably improved airflow through the scrubber and yielded some additional scrubber efficiency improvements. Thus, in-line <b>spray</b> <b>scrubber</b> efficiency trade-offs were observed to be made by altering spray power components of water pressure and/or quantity (number of sprays). Results show that, on average, up to 0. 23 and 0. 32 m 3 /s (484 and 679 cu ft per min) of airflow at 0. 81 and 0. 69 dust capture efficiencies can be achieved with three 8120 and 3320 hollow cone inline series sprays, respectively, operating at 1, 655 kPa (240 psig) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of a spray tower for CO 2 capture instead of a packed absorber column promises substantial advantages, such as reduction of investment and operating costs due to the omission of expensive packing and an insignificant pressure drop. Additionally, a spray scrubbing process offers the opportunity to use precipitating solvents.

In order to demonstrate the applicability of a spray scrubbing process for CO 2 capture and to investigate the most important process and design parameters, a two-way experimental approach was chosen.

40|$|Combustion {{of fossil}} fuels is the main source for {{emissions}} of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Emission regulations and the growing environmental awareness will make great demands upon cost-effective deSO 2 and deNOx techniques in the future. Many of the techniques available today {{have been on the}} market for a long time, however, most of them still have a potential for improvement. To be able to optimize existing techniques it is crucial to increase the understanding of the processes taking place within the scrubber, i. e. chemistry, mass transfer and fluid dynamcis. Mathemathical modeling is an important tool for increasing the understanding. This research work was divided into two different parts: the first part focused on identifying suitable absorbents for wet NOx removal and the second part focused on deriving a model for absorption of SO 2 into a limestone slurry, wet flue gas desulfurization. The ability to absorb NOx were tested in a bubbler for the most common oxidizing agents and EDTA. Further experiments were done with the most promising absorbents, NaClO 2 and KMnO 4, in a packed column where the chemistry was studied in more detail. The absorption process was modeled and rate constants describing the absorption were estimated. A model based on the penetration theory was derived to calculate the absorption of SO 2 into a limestone slurry droplet.

40|$|Summary. This {{carried out}} work is aimed {{enhancing}} {{the efficiency of}} the <b>spray</b> <b>scrubber</b> by combining processes and improving hydraulic conditions in the device. The problem of treating waste gases is often characterized by unique features and the significant factor that makes it difficult to find {{a solution to the problem}} of treatment is the low and/or variable concentration of the pollutant. With a removal efficiency of up to 98 %, wet treatment technology in scrubber type devices is the only practical method advantageous to the treatment of waste gases. The set objective is solved by developing a two-stage treatment system for pyrolysis gas based on ejector scrubbers. Their advantage - a central nozzle supply that allows the scrubber to operate on the principle of an ejector pump. A drift eliminator of the developed device is located on the case unit and a chain is suspended from a clamp mounted on the lower part of the tube neck by pins and two detachable joints. The operation of the scrubber was checked in compliance with the absorption gas treatment of sulfur dioxide. A chemical sorbent, calcium carbonate which is produced as a by-product in the manufacture of nitroammophos at JSC “Minudobrenia” factory is used. Preliminary results indicate that the stiochiometric inlet ratio of Ca/S equals about 2. 0 and SO 2 emissions reduce by 80 - 90 %, significantly larger than the planned 70 % and subsequently corresponds to the residue concentration of less than 30 mg/m 3. This is explained by the greater degree of capture and deposition of the sorbent on the chain curtain (not more than 20 mg/m 3). The proposed device for treating gases enables: improvement in the efficiency of gas treatment; increased reliability; increase in the degree of treatment of the gas flow without the use of additional equipment; reduction in metal and design complexity; reduction on the cost of the treatment process and simplification in the device design...|$|E

This study was conducted to determine the concentration of TEs in bottom ash and fly ash of medical waste incinerator plant in Malaysia. In addition, it is a vital to understand the TEs behaviour and to assess the capability of the existing air pollution control (APC) technologies in Malaysia to comply with the new emission limits of the Environmental Quality (Clean Air) Regulation 2014 which replaces the Malaysia Environmental Quality (Clean Air) 1978.

Odours are basically chemicals dissolved in air which we may be perceived by the sense of olfaction and always referred to as unpleasant smell. As for the case of industrial laundries, the effect of detergent odour becomes significant as cleaning processes simultaneously discharge high detergent concentration to the surrounding air which may lead to serious health issues apart from reducing workers’ performance.

This is due to the unavailibity of tools to measure detergent odour while concentration of NH 4 OH in the scrubbing liquid, i. e. water can be easily determined.
