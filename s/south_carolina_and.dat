5|$|In {{preparation}} of Hermine, multiple tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued in the Southeastern United States, while state of emergencies were declared in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey. Storm surge and heavy rainfall along the Florida gulf coast caused significant damage.

Similar coastal and freshwater flooding occurred in Pasco County, where 7homes were destroyed, 305sustained major damage, and 1,564received minor damage. Winds primarily left power outages and downed trees, some of which fell onto buildings and vehicles. About 325,000people were left without electricity, including 80% of Tallahassee. One death occurred in the state after a tree fell on a homeless man's tent near Ocala. Flooding and fairly strong winds in other states such as Georgia, <b>South</b> <b>Carolina,</b> <b>and</b> North Carolina caused further damage, but to a lesser degree.
