5|$|As in {{the first}} study, the second one also {{included}} a task relating to disliking letters. <b>Subjects</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> select the six letters they liked the least. As before, merely having a letter in one's own name significantly reduced the chances of disliking it. This task revealed an asymmetry in the letter preference hierarchy. While {{there was a large}} consensus within each of the 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.|$|E
5|$|Systematic {{interest}} in the letter preference began in 1959 with brand-preference studies by researchers Mecherikoff and Horton. These tried to find the relative appeal of letters for use in package labels. In {{an extension of the}} studies, <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> rank the English alphabet by the pleasantness of the appearance of capital letters. While there was not a great deal of agreement amongst the subjects (the coefficients of concordance were low), a strong positive correlation was found between a letter's average rank and how frequently it occurred as an initial letter of family names.|$|E
5|$|Cross-lingual {{studies were}} {{performed}} at 13 European universities, using 12 different languages, viz. Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek (the {{only one with}} a non-Roman alphabet), Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish. Because the original yoked design did not lend itself well to long-distance research and standardization, it {{was replaced by a}} simpler, easier to replicate experimental design. <b>Subjects</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> mark the six capital letters they liked most in a randomized list containing all letters of the local alphabet, again without giving it much thought. They had to mark their first preference with 1, their second with 2, etc. The new method was first applied in Belgium. When results showed the name-letter effect at work again, it was copied in the other countries. A total of 2,047 subjects participated, all students.|$|E

25|$|In one experiment, <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> {{write down}} their dreams in a diary. This {{prevented}} the selective memory effect, and the dreams {{no longer seemed}} accurate about the future. Another experiment gave subjects a fake diary of a student with apparently precognitive dreams. This diary described events from the person's life, {{as well as some}} predictive dreams and some non-predictive dreams. When <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> recall the dreams they had read, they remembered more of the successful predictions than unsuccessful ones.|$|E

25|$|An intra-racial {{distinction}} was researched by Newman and Wu, {{who conducted}} a study in which <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> identify various speakers based on race; the speakers included Latinos, African Americans, Chinese Americans, Korean Americans, and white speakers. Listeners tended to successfully categorize speakers as Latino, African American, white or Asian; often, they could not discern between Chinese American and Korean American English speakers, although phonetic differences exist.|$|E

25|$|Sleep {{deprivation}}, {{whether it}} is total sleep deprivation or partial sleep deprivation, can impair working memory in measures of memory, speed of cognitive processing, attention and task switching. Casement et al. found that when <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> recognize digits displayed on a screen by typing them on a keypad, the working memory speed of subjects whose sleep was restricted to four hours a night (approximately 50% of their normal sleep amount) were 58% slower than control groups who were allowed their full eight hours of sleep.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, The Journal of Bone and Mineral Research {{published}} a meta-analysis examining whether milk consumption might protect against hip fracture in middle-aged and older adults. Studies {{could find no}} association between drinking milk and lower rates of fractures. In 2014, JAMA Pediatrics {{published a}} report after monitoring almost 100,000 men and women {{for more than two}} decades. <b>Subjects</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> report on how much milk they had consumed as teenagers, and were followed {{to see if there is}} any association with a reduced chance of hip fractures later in life, it found there was not any. A study published in The BMJ that followed more than 45,000 men and 61,000 women in Sweden age 39 and older had similar results. Milk consumption in adults was associated with no protection for men, and an increased risk of fractures in women. The risk of any bone fracture increased 16 percent in women who drank three or more glasses daily, and the risk of a broken hip increased 60 percent. It was also associated with an increased risk of death in both sexes.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} HKB model experiments, <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> wave one finger on each hand in two modes of {{direction}}: first, known {{as out of}} phase, both fingers moving {{in the same direction}} back and forth (as windshield wipers might move); and second, known as in-phase, where both fingers come together and move away to and from the midline of the body. [...] To illustrate coordination dynamics, the <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> move their fingers out of phase with increasing speed until their fingers were moving as fast as possible.

40|$|A maximum {{likelihood}} estimation procedure is {{developed for the}} simple and the weighted additive models. The data {{are assumed to be}} taken by either one of the following methods: (1) categorical ratings [...] the <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> rate a set of stimuli with respect to an attribute of the stimuli on rating scales with a relatively few observation categories: (2) pair comparisons [...] the <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> judge which one of two stimuli presented at a time dominates the other in some respect: or (3) directional rankings [...] the <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> rank order stimuli in a specific direction (i. e., from the smallest to the largest or the other way around). Although the procedure mainly focuses on these three experimental methods for data collection, {{it is by no means}} restricted to them. Practical uses of the procedure are reported with an emphasis on various advantages of the procedure as a statistical method.

2500|$|In another study, {{subjects}} {{were given a}} list of traits {{instead of the usual}} [...] "fake" [...] personality assessment. The <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> rate how much they felt these traits applied to them. In line with the self-serving bias, the majority of subjects agreed with positive traits about themselves and disagreed with negative ones. The study concluded that the self-serving bias is powerful enough to cancel out the usual Forer effect.|$|E
2500|$|A 2007 survey, of the {{literature}} by Microsoft researcher Kevin Larson presented a different picture: [...] "Peer-reviewed studies have consistently found that using ClearType boosts reading performance compared with other text-rendering systems. In a 2004 study, for instance, Lee Gugerty, a psychology professor at Clemson University, in South Carolina, measured a 17 percent improvement in word recognition accuracy with ClearType. Gugerty’s group also showed, in a sentence comprehension study, that ClearType boosted reading speed by 5 percent and comprehension by 2 percent. Similarly, in {{a study published in}} 2007, psychologist Andrew Dillon at the University of Texas at Austin found that when <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> scan a spreadsheet and pick out certain information, they did those tasks 7 percent faster with ClearType." ...|$|E
