40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} results of detailed investigation of the possible use of <b>stabilised</b> <b>sludge</b> and brown coal fly ash as raw material ingredients for road construction and manufacture of building bricks. The thesis is organised into seven chapters including a general introduction chapter. A literature review of solid waste management practices employed in Australia and some selected countries are discussed (chapter 1) together with waste generation from power stations. Particular attention is given to industrial waste disposal into Victorian landfills and the current waste management system in the state is compared with international best practices. The sampling program and sample collection methods used in this study are described in chapter 2. The results of the preliminary waste characterisation of treated solid industrial wastes from waste treatment plant, mainly slurry (liquid sludge), filter cake and <b>stabilised</b> <b>sludge</b> are presented in this chapter to provide a "snapshot" of the organic and inorganic composition of the waste materials. It also enabled the identification of key target analytes of concern for further study. The methodologies and analytical instruments employed in the sampling plan and analyses used are also discussed in this chapter. Chapter 3 focuses on elemental, organic and ionic chemical analysis of filter cake and <b>stabilised</b> <b>sludge</b> from industrial waste treatment plant using different analytical techniques. This chapter also contains elemental characterisation of brown coal fly ash from power stations in the Latrobe Valley, Victoria, Australia. The leachability of heavy metals from filter cake and <b>stabilised</b> <b>sludge</b> samples are also presented in this chapter and the identified components that can impact on the potential reuse/recycle of the solids were examined by using different analytical techniques to improve the treatment performance in terms of transfer of contaminants from liquid to solid phases. The principles and applications of XRD, TGA and SEM techniques to the analysis of environmental samples are discussed in chapter 4. XRD and TGA analyses were conducted on filter cake and <b>stabilised</b> <b>sludge</b> from industrial waste treatment plant,whereas SEM analysis were performed on fly ash, mixture of fly ash and <b>stabilised</b> <b>sludge,</b> bricks produced from sludge/fly ash and clay fired at 1000 °C. Characterisation of the waste materials with these techniques revealed that phase, thermal and morphological properties are useful to understand the complex mineral composition and the performance of waste materials for certain end use applications. The suitability of <b>stabilised</b> <b>sludge</b> and brown coal fly ash mixtures as road base and sub-base material (chapter 5) was investigated by measuring index properties, pH and electrical conductivity, compaction, unconfined compression strength, California bearing ratio, triaxial shear stress and permeability tests. This chapter also discussed the physical and mechanical properties of the individual waste streams (sludge and fly ash) as a first step in identifying its potential application for reuse/recycle as raw material ingredient in road construction. The results obtained in this chapter indicate that the addition of fly ash to the <b>stabilised</b> <b>sludge</b> and curing time were the most important factors to improve the physical/mechanical properties of the waste materials. The combination of <b>stabilised</b> <b>sludge</b> and fly ash as raw material ingredients for making building bricks was considered in chapter 6. The characteristics of bricks made from these waste materials in different mixtures were investigated. The successful development of a new process for making bricks is detailed in this chapter and the product is referred to as "Enviro-brick". This process provides an opportunity for reducing the environmental impact of solid industrial wastes from waste treatment plants and power stations. The conclusions and implication for further research are presented in chapter 7...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of developmental stages of endoparasite germs (cysts, oocysts, protozoa, and helminth eggs) as an indirect detection factor of endoparasitoses circulation in the environment, was examined in raw municipal wastewater, sludge and biologically cleaned waste water. Examination of municipal wastewater and sludge from five monitored {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTPs) in east Slovakia, from various fractions of municipal wastewater, confirmed 35. 87 % positivity of samples for the endoparasitic germs. Among of all analysed samples 11. 09 % were protozoan oo(cysts) and 20. 87 % were helminth eggs. 3. 91 % of samples showed positivity to both the helminth eggs and protozoan oo(cysts). In the raw wastewater the protozoa comprised of Giardia spp. (1. 08 %) and Entamoeba spp. (1. 08 %). The helminth eggs primarily consisted of Ascaris spp. (4. 35 %) and strongyle-type eggs (3. 26 %). No germs of protozoa or helminths {{were found in the}} treated wastewater. However, the highest presence of the germs was found in drained <b>stabilised</b> <b>sludge.</b> The average number of oo(cysts) /kg was 2. 86 ± 0. 24 and the average number of helminth eggs/kg was 5. 77 ± 0. 09. In all kinds of sludge, obtained during the process of wastewater treatment, there were protozoan (Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp., Entamoeba spp.) and helminths eggs (Ascaris spp., Trichuris spp., Taenia spp., Hymenolepis spp., or strongyle-type eggs) presented. In drained (condensed) <b>stabilised</b> <b>sludge</b> the eggs of Capillaria spp. and Toxocara spp. were also detected. From the epidemiological aspect the sewage sludge, due to high concentration of protozoal oo(cysts) or helminth eggs, represents a significant epidemiological risk for the endoparasitoses dissemination...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} results of experimental dewatering of <b>stabilised</b> <b>sludge</b> analysis and study. The experiments were carried out in the laboratory, and the sludge came from communal wastewater treatment plants. The experiment focused on impact of consumption of flocculant and influencing variables on the dewatered sludge. Dry solids in dewatered sludge and glowing loss were observed. It was proven that specific consumption of flocculant has greater impact on dry residue content in dewatered sludge. It is evident that the different polymer products have different dewatering results and that they also need different specific amounts for the ideal dewatering result. Looking at the discussion and results of the influences for the dewatering ability of the sludge, {{it can be seen that}} the ignition loss and excess sludge proportion as well as water binding forms play a major role in defining the dewatering ability of the sewage sludge. This illustrated the importance of considering the combined influencing variables in to the dewatering of the sewage sludge as they are interconnected...|$|E

40|$|The {{necessity}} for economically feasible landfill {{operations for the}} safe disposal/use of municipal sludges has become of paramount importance {{as a result of}} increasing environmental requirements augmenting the quantities of concentrated sludges being produced. Effective landfill designs necessitate a thorough understanding of treated sludge behaviour which is presently fragmented and limited. This project sets out to determine the drying characteristics, pertinent engineering properties and courses of action for the safe storage and landfilling of <b>stabilised</b> <b>sludge.</b> Geotechnical properties are presented, which when applied to the design of landfill areas, will increase deposit stability, decrease volume, control leachate and maximise the life of the landfill site. The results indicated that sludge dried slowly being inhibited by low permeability. Processed material was generally difficult to compact and highly compressible, consolidating {{over a long period of}} time with substantial secondary compression. Strength was time dependent with fibre decomposition and undrained creep reducing strength with elapsed time causing long-term instability in sludge landfills.

40|$|Many {{substances}} {{related to}} human activities {{end up in}} wastewater and accumulate in sewage sludge. The present study focuses on the analysis of widely used UV filters 3 -(4 -methylbenzylidene) camphor (4 -MBC), octyl-methoxycinnamate (OMC), octocrylene (OC) and octyl-triazone (OT) in sewage sludge originating from a monitoring network in Switzerland. Mean concentrations in <b>stabilised</b> <b>sludge</b> from 14 wastewater treatment plants were 1780, 110, 4840 and 5510 μg/kg dry matter for 4 -MBC, OMC, OC and OT, respectively. Specific loads in sewage sludge show that UV filters originate mainly from private households, but surface runoff and industries may be considered as additional sources. This indicates that besides use for sunscreens and cosmetics UV filters might occur in plastics and other materials and be released to the environment by volatilization or leaching. Differences between the modeled per capita loads of UV filters in sewage sludge and the observed specific loads in sewage sludge are probably due to erroneous figures of production volumes, degradation and sorption during wastewater treatment as well as degradation processes during transport in the sewer or sludge treatment. Thus, {{further research is needed}} to elucidate the fate of UV filters after application and release into the environment. Other compounds used as UV filters should be included in future studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Wastewater sludges {{are used}} in {{agriculture}} as soil amendment and fertilizer, {{with regard to their}} organic matter and nutrient content. However, availability of nitrogen and phosphorus from sludge-amended soils and their transfer in runoff may lead to eutrophication of downstream surface water. The aim {{of this study is to}} establish and compare the effect of two different sludges on these transfers: an anaerobically digested and thermically <b>stabilised</b> <b>sludge</b> (Seine-Aval treatment plant, sludge no. 1), and a limed sludge (Saint-Quentin treatment plant, sludge no. 2). Experiments were performed on 12 sloping micro-plots (1 m × 1 m) submitted to sludge spreading and controlled rainfall simulation. Runoff water was sampled and analysed for concentrations in nitrogen species and phosphorus. Results show that spreading of sludge no. 1 increased both ammonium nitrogen (mean of 1. 1 mg L− 1 N–NH 4 vs. 0. 2 mg L− 1 N–NH 4 for control micro-plots) and particulate phosphorus concentrations (mean of 2 mg L− 1 P vs. 1. 1 mg L− 1 P for control micro-plots) in runoff water. On the other hand, sludge no. 2 did not induce any significant effect on nutrient concentrations in runoff. These results are related to chemical composition and physical treatment of sludges. This study underlines the existence of a short-term risk of nutrient mobilisation by runoff after sludge spreading on soil, and the need to check precisely the impact of this practice on water quality...|$|E

40|$|Conventionally {{treated sewage}} sludge may contain high {{concentrations}} of potentially pathogenic microorganisms and additional treatment is required to minimise the risks to health {{if it is to}} be recycled to agricultural land. Mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) is the most widely used process in the UK for <b>stabilising</b> <b>sludge</b> prior to agricultural recycling, but little is known about the fate of a number of enteric pathogens as the sludge passes through the treatment processes. The aim of this study was to determine the efficiency of MAD in removing the bacterial enteric pathogens, Salmonella senftenberg, Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobacter jejuni which were added as a spike to the digester feedstock, together with the die-off of indigenous Escherichia coli already present in the sludge. The primary sludge digestion stage of MAD was found to achieve a log removal of 1. 66 for E. coli, 2. 23 for L. monocytogenes and 2. 23 for S. senftenberg. However, the extent of die-off was a function of the numbers of pathogens in the feed and as these increased the log removal also increased. The numbers of C. jejuni were not affected by primary sludge digestion. Additional die-off was provided by secondary sludge digestion with log removals of 1. 70 for E. coli, 2. 10 for S. senftenberg and 0. 36 for C. jejuni...|$|R

During the period 1987 - 1989 the plant received about one third of the design load.

40|$|Abstract. In {{previous}} studies (part I) {{it has been}} established that methane fermentation of chromium-free tannery wastes results in partly <b>stabilised</b> post-fermentation <b>sludges,</b> rich in nitrogen and phosphorus. This part of the investigations have confirmed that {{in view of the}} quality of fertilising material, the composting of post-fermentation sludges is most beneficial; and composting of non-fermented wastes is less beneficial. The sludges from short fermentation (only partly stabilised) and after prolonged fermentation were sub-jected to composting. The composting of sludges allowed to obtain material, rich in basic fertilising components and organic soil-forming components. The paper shows {{that it is possible to}} reduce the arduousness of direct composting (with the omission of fermenta-tion) of chromium-free tannery wastes. The dependence of the quantity of basic fertilising and soil-forming components in the obtained material on the applied processing condi-tions has been shown...|$|R

40|$|The cyclic or {{sequencing}} batch {{activated sludge}} process {{was applied for}} the treatment of septage originating from cesspools serving non-sewered areas. Single and two stage systems were investigated in bench scale units. The single stage aerated system was capable in removing practically all the biodegradable COD and producing a well <b>stabilised</b> excess <b>sludge</b> with excellent settling and thickening characteristics. With respect to nitrogen the average removal rate was to the order of 70 %, but the performance was unstable due to periodic strong inhibition of the nitrification process. Subsequent treatment in a second stage aerated unit improved nitrification but did not result in higher nitrogen removal rates due to the increased concentrations of oxidised nitrogen, An anoxic second stage post denitrification unit resulted in an overall nitrogen removal of 88 %, through a substantial reduction of nitrates. Further improvement of the system, with nitrogen removal of about 95 % and average effluent nitrogen concentrations lower than 10 mg. l(- 1), can be achieved by adoption of a two stage system consisting of a first aerated stage unit, followed by a second stage unit with alternating aerated and anoxic cycles and addition of external carbon during the anoxic cycle...|$|R
40|$|In my diploma I {{deal with}} small {{purification}} plants in Ljubljana urban region. There {{are many different}} polluted water purification systems, where mechanical, physicochemical as well as biological processes run, whether singly or in combination. By using the biological processes we try to imitate purifying processes in the nature as much as possible. The aim of small purification plants is to purify water {{to such an extent}} as would be possible to draw it off into the environment – whether it flows underground or into watercourses – in accordance with regulations and requirements. To purify the waste water, many different ways or technological procedures are available. Every purification plant has two products – purified waste water and <b>stabilised</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> – irrespective of the way or procedure chosen. In Slovenia special water protection areas for water resources in public use were adopted or proposed.

Ochre from the drying beds and wetland at the Woolley Mine Water Treatment System and from a natural analogue at the Silwood Park Wet-land, was placed in growth cells in various proportions with local waste materials, particularly coal spoil and <b>stabilised</b> sewage <b>sludge.</b> In one set of experiments, twenty-four cells of dimensions approximately 0. 7 m x 0. 7 m x 0. 4 m depth were employed in an exposed location, each fitted with a discharge pipe at the base.

Smaller scale laboratory trials were also sown in pots using Silwood wetland sludge in combination with local sand and decayed wood detritus. Plant growth was vigorous {{in the field in}} coal shale and compost mix-tures, both with and without added ochre. During the second season growth was reduced, but less so in ternary mixtures- possibly because of reduced nutrient leaching by beneficial retention of phosphate on ochre.

40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{is used to}} <b>stabilise</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> {{and produce}} biogas. Whilst the need to mix digesters is well-recognised, the level of mixing required {{and its effects on}} biogas production are not clear. Here, the effects of mixing speed in mechanically-mixed lab-scale digesters on biogas production are considered. For the first time, positron emission particle tracking was used to visualise flow patterns in lab-scale digesters at different mixing speeds. Computational fluid dynamics models were then built to identify the turbulence characteristics. Four lab-scale digesters were run for four months at different mixing speeds and key indicators of digester stability and microbiological population were recorded alongside gas production. Increased mixing speed leads to higher levels of turbulence and in these digesters, increasing the mixing speed reduces the stability of the methane generation process and accordingly has a detrimental effect on the gas production. Similarly, the abundance of methanogenic communities was adversely affected by increasing mixing speeds. However, the unmixed digester produced less biogas than the digester mixed at a low speed, due to uncontrolled digestion. As such, for these digesters, minimal mixing represents the ideal scenario. By considering the velocity gradient in the digester as a surrogate for turbulence, a threshold of 6 8 s- 1 was identified. Below this threshold, increased mixing was beneficial but increasing mixing above the threshold was detrimental to digester stability and gas production...|$|R
40|$|<b>Stabilised</b> {{wastewater}} <b>sludge</b> (biosolids) has beneficial re-use properties {{but these}} are limited {{by the presence of}} human pathogens. In this study soil amendment with biosolids and storage of biosolids prior to re-use were examined as disposal and treatment options. In a soil amendment trial biosolids were mixed with sandy soil and monitored for 37 weeks. In two storage trials biosolids were stored in piles 1 m high and monitored for < 60 weeks. Included in the monitoring programme were tests to determine the concentrations of faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci and salmonellae. In both the soil amendment trials and biosolids storage trials, concentrations of indicator organisms and salmonellae decreased through an extended hot, dry summer period. Although these organisms were not detected in the majority of samples taken during the summer, repopulation of faecal coliforms and salmonellae occurred in the trials following rainfall {{at the beginning of the}} winter. In the case of one of the storage trials repopulation occurred following a period of 50 weeks when salmonellae and faecal coliforms were not detected. When repopulation occurred, faecal coliform concentrations increased to higher than those at the beginning of the trials. These results suggest that faecal coliforms and salmonellae were at undetectable concentrations through the summer period but were able to grow when provided with favourable conditions. From this limited trial it was concluded that soil amended with biosolids could not be considered free from pathogens for at least one year following amendment...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{microbial}} {{fuel cells}} (MFCs) have been integrated with membrane bioreactors (MBRs), either in an internal or an external configuration, for wastewater treatment and energy recovery. In an external configuration, MFCs {{could be applied}} for an efficient sludge reduction since they can simultaneously address energy issue and environmental concerns associated with sludge treatment. In the present study, a potentiostatic controlled microbial fuel cell (MFC) was fed with activated sludge from a membrane bioreactor (MBR) at different total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations (1 – 10 gTSS L − 1) {{in order to assess}} the electrochemical response of the system and the impact of the bioelectrochemical treatment on sludge characteristics and membrane fouling parameters. The MFC showed COD removals 30 % higher than the control test and a reduction of volatile suspended solids (VSS) up to 43 % with concomitant production of energy (maximum current density of 2. 0 A m − 2). The electricity production increased with the increase of TSS content. In both MFC and the control test, an increase of soluble microbial products (SMP) ratio in terms of proteins and carbohydrates (SMPp/SMPc) and an average 50 % increase of sludge hydrophobicity were observed. This could limit membrane fouling in the case that the sludge is recirculated to the MBR. The electrochemical characterization indicated that both, acetate and sludge oxidation took place at a similar formal potential of − 0. 2 V vs. SHE indicating that both used the same electron transfer mechanism.

40|$|M. Dip. Tech. (Environmental Health) At {{the onset}} of this project {{the aim was to}} utilise fly ash, {{supplemented}} with lime, to <b>stabilise</b> sewage <b>sludge,</b> in so doing create an artificial soil. This would be an environmentally friendly method of disposing of both the fly ash 'and the sewage sludge which are both considered wastes. The sewage sludge was pasteurised by the temperature produced by the exothermic reaction between the moisture ofthe sewage sludge and the high pH ofthe fly ash and the lime. Initially very high concentrations of lime were utilised to achieve the pasteurisation of the sewage sludge. These levels proved to be adequate to completely sterilise the sludge, rather than pasteurise it, as temperatures in excess of 1000 e were obtained and maintained for a prolonged period. The product, SLASH, should ideally maintain some of the non-pathogenic microorganisms to facilitate natural degradation processes in the soil.. It was thus decided to minimise the lime addition and maximise the ash usage without losing the necessary soil-like texture of the SLASH product and still insuring pasteurisation. Various 10 kg tests were conducted on differing ratios of sewage sludge, ash and lime. The mixtures were contained in insulated 220 litre drums in order to ensure a minimum of interference from environmental factors. The tests were conducted with the drums sealed and unsealed, as well as with coarse and finely milled lime-stone. These laboratory scale tests led to the establishment of a preferred 6 : 3 : 1 ratio ofsewage sludge to ash to lime. After an international visit to a plant manufacturing a similar product, it was suggested that the ratio be amended to 6. 3 : 3. 4 : 0. 6 of sewage sludge to ash to lime. Tests showed that although the temperatures obtained when using this ratio were insufficient for pasteurisation, pasteurisation did occur. This was attributed to the maintenance of the pH of the product above 12 for more than 24 hours. This severely stressed the microorgansims and they died. No pathogenic bacteria were detected in the analyses from these tests, but the total aerobic bacterial count indicated the presence of some microorganisms which would become part of the soils natural flora...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} phosphorus (P) recycling {{from urban}} areas {{is becoming an}} increasing issue due to the scarcity of natural P deposits. In order to assess the environmental performance of different approaches of P recycling, a LCA assessment and risk assessment studies were carried out. Generally, we found the supply of recycled P-fertilisers (RPFs) to be competitive as compared to conventional sources in terms of LCA results analysed in this contribution: per kg P and with exclusion of infrastructure processes, the highest abiotic depletion potential is shown for conventional mineral fertilisers based on phosphate rocks due to the finite mineral P resources. For fossil primary energy demand, the recycled fertilisers (struvites and an ash-based fertiliser analysed) had highest impacts per kg P. Relatively high acidification and eutrophication potentials from the supply of P-fertilisers are related to composts, triple-superphosphate and struvites. For the global warming potential per kg P, compost presents the worst results again. However, if co-products of organic fertilisers are considered (i. e. N- and K-contents and the humus sequestration potential), most organic fertilisers are in advantage {{for a number of}} indicators – with the exception of conventional composting. The low emission compost and the <b>stabilised</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> present moderate to good overall results. The best relative results for all indicators were found for biogas digestate. To assess the risk of soil contamination related to the long-term application of RPFs, accumulation scenarios in soil were calculated with a mass balance approach for the potentially toxic elements (PTEs) Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn and for the persistent organic pollutants (POPs) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F) in composts, digestates and other RPFs derived from sewage sludge For all calculations, a fertiliser application over 200 years equivalent to 11 kg P ha- 1 yr- 1 was assumed. Dependent on PTE mobility in soil due to pH and precipitation excess F, an accumulation or depletion compared to the soil background values was found. Highest accumulation was found in scenario pH 7 F 0, 1 m yr- 1, lowest in scenario pH 5 F 0, 3 m yr- 1. Fertilisers like composts, with low P content compared to PTE load, had a higher accumulation potential than fertilisers like struvite, meat and bone meal, sewage sludge ash, sewage sludge and digestates, rock phosphate and triple super-phosphate. Only Cd accumulation with TSP was higher than that with compost. For POPs no accumulation risk in soil was found...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{methods are}} {{required}} in developing regions to treat and recover value from pit latrine sludge. One {{strategy is to}} pyrolyse pit latrine contents and generate char and bio-oil, which can then {{be used as a}} soil enhancer and fuel, respectively. Despite the many benefits associated with the process, there is very limited relevant literature available. This study examines its feasibility. Initially, the energy balance for the pyrolysis of sewage sludge was calculated using data from 14 literature studies. The average net energy recovery from pyrolysis of dewatered and dried sewage sludge followed by use of bio-oil as fuel was calculated as 4. 95 ± 0. 61 MJ kg− 1. For dewatered sewage sludge, an average net energy input of 2. 23 ± 0. 31 MJ kg− 1 was required. Parallel calculations were undertaken where pit latrine sludge with 0 – 100 % water content was the hypothetical feedstock. On average, net energy recovery from produced bio-oil was achievable when pit latrine sludge with a water content of ≤∼ 55 % was the feedstock. When both bio-oil and char were utilised, net energy recovery was feasible at a water content value of ≤∼ 65 %. Char production is more favourable from <b>stabilised</b> pit latrine <b>sludge</b> with lower moisture and volatile solids content. Barriers to the pyrolysis of pit latrine sludge include its heterogeneous composition and the difficulty of collecting high-viscosity sludge. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of pyrolysis as a disposal and value addition method for pit latrine sludge. Innovative methods for sludge drying and pit emptying will expedite the process becoming a reality...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of sludge volumes for disposal {{is a topic}} of high interest for wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) all over the world. Steadily increasing volumes for disposal create an economic, environmental, legislative and technological challenge. Researchers and process developers try to minimise the sludge during its genesis or in the downstream treatment. Due to rising costs and scarcity of fossil raw materials, the view on sludge streams are about to change. Efforts are made to reuse the valuable components and to put them back into a new lifecycle. Wastewater sludge contains a number of interesting compounds like carbon that {{can be converted to}} biogas as an energy carrier, as well as nitrogen and phosphorus that can be recycled as fertilisers. Anaerobic digestion is a widespread method to <b>stabilise</b> the <b>sludge</b> by decreasing the carbon content in a downstream treatment step at WWTPs. Our studies showed that certain additives can increase the biogas potential. Wastewater sludge contains to a large extent extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that are formed during the biological treatment steps and that consist of a polymeric network structure of mainly carbohydrates, proteins and humic substances that are interlinked with multivalent metal cations. The addition of a cation-binding agent like sodium citrate extracts the metal ions from this structure and solubilises the EPS. The former inertial compounds that passed the anaerobic digestion almost unchanged become accessible to microbial activity. A combination of cation-binding agents and hydrolytic enzymes showed that the enzymes were protected from entrapment and deactivation in the sludge matrix. In lab-scale trials, the following factors were varied for the better understanding of the reaction mechanisms: Species and dosage of enzymes and cation-binding agents, total solids, reaction time, temperature and pH. Both the sludge solubilisation and enzymatic hydrolysis were found to increase by 40 % and over 80 % respectively depending on the chosen settings. In a subsequent development step, this process was tested in industrial scale on two municipal WWTP in different setups. The settings had to be adapted to the industrial surroundings, which meant mainly going from batch to continuous setups, extended experimental times and decreased chemical dosages. The performance of the digesters was observed during the experimental time of several months up to two years. In an initial industrial trial over six months, two glycosodic enzymes were added to one digester in a setup of two. The results were then compared between the treated and the reference digester. In an advanced industrial trial over two years of chemical and enzymatic addition, a set of four hydrolytic enzymes together with sodium citrate as cation-binding agent was added to a complete digestion system in reduced dosages. For the evaluation of the results, the collected data from the year preceding the two-year trial period were selected as references. In both cases, the biogas production and the sludge dry solids for disposal after the centrifuge were considerably improved. The lab model and the results from the lab-scale trials were confirmed by the experiments in industrial scale...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} (AD) plays a {{key role}} in the recovery of renewable energy, in the form of biogas, and nutrients from waste materials. Pre-treatment of AD substrates has the potential to improve process performance in terms of increased methane yield and solids reduction, but pretreatments are not yet widely implemented into full-scale AD systems. The aims of this thesis were to identify conditions that determine when pre-treatment has a positive impact on an AD system and ways to improve the practical utility of pre-treatment impact assessment. Key steps towards meeting these aims were to determine and critically analyse effects of pre-treatments on AD, and current evaluation schemes at three levels: AD substrate level – Direct effects on the substrate’s chemical and physical characteristics and its biodegradability/bioavailability; Local AD system level – Effects of pre-treatment on the AD process and its outputs, required inputs and (local) upstream and downstream processes. System boundaries are “at the gate” of the AD plant and the system analysis may consider energy and/or financial parameters; Expanded AD System level – Includes indirect effects of pre-treatment, with system boundaries including external processes. The system analysis may address environmental and/or economic effects. Different substrate traits represent different types and degrees of limitations to optimal AD performance that can be met by different pre-treatment mechanisms. Most importantly, potential mechanical problems must be handled by dilution and/or homogenisation and unwanted components, as generally found in source-sorted food waste from households (FW), must be separated. These traits may hinder the actual operation of AD and the potential for recovery of nutrients, which is often the motivation for biological waste treatment. When these practical barriers are overcome, pre-treatment focus may be directed towards maximizing the conversion of organic material to biogas, which is potentially limited by the rate and/or extent of hydrolysis. Lignocellulosic structures and aerobically <b>stabilised</b> biological <b>sludge</b> represent significant barriers to hydrolysis, which can be overcome by pre-treatment-induced solubilisation. Other particulates are merely hydrolysis-limited by their size, which can be reduced by specific pre-treatments. Finally, substrates may contain non-biodegradable organic compounds, which need to be chemically transformed in order to be converted to biogas. The substrates considered for AD incorporate these traits in varying degrees and even among substrates of the same category, such as plant material and excess sludge from wastewater treatment (WWT), the potential effect of pretreatments may vary considerably. Overcoming the substrate barriers via pre-treatment may potentially improve the AD system by enhancing operational stability, increasing methane yields and solids reduction under similar operating conditions to those without pre-treatment or by increasing methane productivity by allowing reductions in hydraulic retention time without changing the methane yield. However, the required inputs as well as the associated effects on related sub-processes must also be considered. The ultimate usefulness of a pre-treatment in a specific system is determined by the mass- and energy balance and the associated financial or environmental costs/values of inputs and outputs. The accuracy and applicability of pre-treatment impact assessment is challenged by method limitations and lack of transparency. A common measure of the pre-treatment effects is COD solubilisation, but the interpretation is complicated by the application of different measurementapproaches. In addition, solubilisation of COD as a result of pre-treatment does not necessarily translate into increases in operational methane yields. This is due to potential formation of refractory compounds and the fact that hydrolysis is not necessarily rate limiting for all particulates. Pre-treatments’ effects on biodegradability and degradation rates can be better assessed by BMP tests (biochemical methane potential), provided that the test conditions are appropriate and the tests’ limitations are properly considered. However, extrapolation of BMP results to continuous processes is complicated by the batch mode of the tests. On the other hand, results from continuous trials allow assessments of methane yields in practical systems and the digestate’s physico-chemical properties, but are inevitably tied to the specific process conditions tested. Thus, results from multiple experimental conditions, possibly strengthened by computer simulations, are necessary for generalisations of pre-treatment effects on AD process performance. Pre-treatments have the potential to considerably improve AD systems, but their implementation must to be guided by the actual improvement potential of the specific substrate and valued in theirspecific context with respect to process design and framework conditions.

40|$|The {{development}} of treatment processes {{to reduce or}} reuse sewage sludge is crucial for a proper environmental management. Segregating primary from secondary sludge allows for better reuse of secondary sludge, since digested secondary sludge is better suited for agricultural application, containing about double concentration in nutrients but significantly less contaminants. However, secondary sludge (also called waste activated sludge (WAS)) is difficult to dewater compared with primary sludge due {{to the existence of}} colloidal materials and extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs), which strongly retain water. WAS is also more difficult to digest under anaerobic conditions due to the presence of glycan strands in microbial cell walls. The low dewaterability and digestibility of WAS can be improved by applying treatments, which can partially disintegrate the WAS by disrupting flocs and cells and solubilising the EPSs. The treatments studied in this thesis were ultrasound, low-temperature thermal and alkali with NaOH. Specifically, it has been analysed the effect of the aforementioned treatment on WAS rheology, dewatering, hygienisation and anaerobic digestion. Rheology is the study of stress-strain relationships of viscoelastic materials. All the sludges analysed (untreated and treated) behaved as non-Newtonian pseudoplastic fluids, which indicates that the viscosity decreases with the applied shear rate. The sludges were also thixotropic (showing a hysteresis area in the plot of stress versus shear rate), which means that the viscosity is time dependent. The three aforementioned treatments resulted in the reduction of the steady state viscosity and the hysteresis area. Complementarily, a rheological structural model was proposed to examine the variations in the thixotropic behaviour of WAS after the application of the treatments. Sludge dewatering is essential to obtain a product dry enough to allow a reduction in storage volume. The three conditions of the thermal treatment (60, 80 and 90 ºC; 1 h, including the heating time to reach the temperature) and the higher intensities of ultrasound (27, 000 kJ/kg TS) and alkali (157 g NaOH/kg TS) treatments improved sludge dewatering by centrifugation. To further evaluate the effect of treatments on the sludge dewatering, the EPSs contained in sludge were extracted and characterised. The EPSs were fractionated to generate two different EPS fractions: loosely bound EPSs (LB-EPSs) and tightly bound EPSs (TB-EPSs), where the latter is the innermost fraction and harder to release. An analysis of the untreated sludge revealed that the proteins, followed by the humic acids and polysaccharides, were the major constituents of the EPSs. Each of these components was primarily observed in the TB-EPS fraction. The treatments, particularly the alkali treatment, thoroughly solubilised the EPS, as indicated by the increase in the TOC, protein, humic acid and polysaccharide contents in the LB-EPS fraction. As a result, the dewaterability of WAS was improved. Hygienisation of the sludge is of uttermost importance if the sludge is intended for agriculture. The level of hygienisation was evaluated using three indicator organisms: Escherichia coli, somatic coliphages (SOMCPH) and spores of sulfite-reducing clostridia (SSRC). The thermal treatment at 80 ºC and the alkali treatment at 157 g NaOH kg TS allowed the hygienisation of the sludge, thus satisfying normal levels accepted by the EPA and the 3 rd official draft from the EU. Conversely, the conditions tested for the ultrasound treatment barely reduced the levels of microbial indicators. Mesophilic anaerobic digestion is a widely used method to <b>stabilise</b> the <b>sludge.</b> The alkali pre-treatment (157 g NaOH/kg TS) exhibited the greatest methane production increase (34 %) followed by the ultrasonication (27, 000 kJ/kg TS; 13 %), whereas the thermal pre-treatment (80 ºC, 15 min) presented a methane potential similar to the untreated sludge. However, the use of NaOH as a pre-treatment is rather limited because of the rising sodium concentration in the digester. El desarrollo de procesos para la reducción o reutilización de los lodos resulta determinante para una apropiada gestión medioambiental. Tratando por separado el lodo activado del primario (y no la mezcla como suele hacerse) se favorece el uso del lodo activado en agricultura tras su digestión, ya que el lodo activado contiene el doble de nutrientes y menor carga contaminante que el primario. No obstante, el lodo activado (también denominado lodo secundario o biológico) es más difícil de deshidratar que el primario, ya que presenta una estructura interna organizada de flóculos unidos por las sustancias poliméricas extracelulares (EPSs, por sus siglas en inglés), las cuales atrapan el agua. En este contexto, la reología, que es la ciencia que estudia las relaciones entre la fuerza y la deformación de los materiales, es una herramienta muy útil para la caracterización de la viscosidad o estructura interna de los lodos. El lodo activado es también más difícil de digerir anaeróbicamente debido a las cadenas de glicanos presentes en las paredes celulares de las bacterias. En resumen, para poder deshidratar y digerir un lodo activado será necesario acondicionarlo previamente mediante tratamientos, con el fin de solubilizar las EPSs y aumentar su biodegradabilidad. Si además el lodo quiere destinarse a agricultura deberá estar higienizado. En esta tesis se ha estudiado el efecto de tres tratamientos (ultrasonido, térmico a baja temperatura y alcalino con NaOH) sobre la reología, deshidratación, higienización y digestión anaerobia de lodos activados. Los tres tratamientos redujeron considerablemente la viscosidad del lodo debido a la solubilización de la las EPSs. Así mismo, la solubilización de la EPSs facilitó la expulsión del agua confinada dentro de los flóculos del lodo, mejorando la deshidratación mediante centrifugación. El tratamiento alcalino con dosis de NaOH elevadas fue el que más EPSs solubilizó, de manera que fue el que permitió extraer más agua y el que más aumentó la producción de metano, además de higienizar el lodo. No obstante, este tratamiento tiene el inconveniente de incrementar la concentración de sodio en el digestor, lo cual podría llegar a inhibir el proceso de digestión. Los ultrasonidos redujeron notablemente la viscosidad, además de mejorar la deshidratación y la digestión del lodo. Sin embargo, este tratamiento no fue capaz de higienizar el lodo. El tratamiento térmico a baja temperatura aumentó muy ligeramente la producción de metano (posiblemente debido al corto tiempo de exposición) y permitió deshidratar e higienizar el lodo...|$|R
