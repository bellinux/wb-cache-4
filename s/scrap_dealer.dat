The motorized trucks were sold to the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway.|$|E
25|$|The {{exhibition}} {{closed in}} the late 1990s {{and almost all of}} the exhibits were taken away. The locomotive The Queen was too expensive to remove, so, rather than being cut up, it was incorporated as a feature of a restaurant on the concourse. It is still there today, but looking a little tired. The tender– the only original (and historic) part of the replica engine– was sold to a <b>scrap</b> <b>dealer</b> and cut up, although the springs and axleboxes were salvaged for use in the replica LB Atlantic project at the Bluebell Railway, and part of one side was rescued by the Slough and Windsor Railway Society, where it is now on display.|$|E
500|$|Similar {{incidents}} {{occurred in}} Thailand in 2008, without injuries. In June 2008, a cesium-137 {{sealed radioactive source}} was found among scrap metal sold to a <b>scrap</b> <b>dealer</b> in Ayutthaya Province. The dealer recognized the trefoil symbol, and notified the OAP, which responded and found no leak of radiation or contamination. It could not, however, determine {{the origins of the}} equipment. In August, a recycling factory in Chachoengsao Province notified the OAP after a piece of scrap [...] metal set off its gate detector alarm. The OAP found that the piece of metal contained radium-226 sources, and concluded that it originated from unlicensed use in a lightning preventer.|$|E

500|$|The {{residents}} of Richfield pressured the Rio Grande {{to use the}} portion of the line that was still intact and build a connection to an existing Union Pacific line (the Sharp Subdivision) near Nephi, roughly parallel to State Route 28. However, the railroad determined with the additional cost of acquiring land for the new right-of-way, the cost would be comparable to rebuilding the old route. In addition, the Rio Grande would have to pay trackage rights to the Union Pacific for the connection from Nephi, which would further erode profits on a line that was barely profitable. In the end, the Rio Grande sold the line to a <b>scrap</b> <b>dealer</b> who dismantled it. Since the line's closure, there have been multiple proposals to rebuild it. Studies note the loss of railroad access to the region has affected the ability of local industries to compete with producers in other regions that have rail access. [...] A 2002 study placed the cost of rebuilding the modified routing of the Marysvale branch line at $80 million, while a 2015 study placed the cost of rebuilding the line as far south as Salina at $110 million (equivalent to $ million in [...] ). The 2015 study listed restoring rail access to the region as one of three priorities for new freight rail lines in a study presented by the Utah Department of Transportation detailing the current state of Utah's rail infrastructure. It specifically noted in increase of coal hauling trucks on highways and streets in the area due to the loss of rail access.|$|E

As a normal practice the used packaging timber in India is used for repacking, as firewood and low-end interior decoration purpose. Sustainable eco-efficient repurposing of used packaging timber forms the basis for 8 ̆ 4 DESIGN THINKING FOR RE-PURPOSING USED PACKAGING TIMBER?. Used packaging timber from industries and warehouses is obtained by <b>scrap</b> <b>dealers</b> and sorted according to material, size, quality and quantity. The <b>scrap</b> <b>dealers</b> remove nails and screws and the material is sold in retail by weight to the user. Design Circle, Bangalore, India have been re-purposing used packaging timber and plywood from 2004 onwards. The packaging timber from <b>scrap</b> <b>dealers</b> is processed further to suit different product categories like toys, educational products, lifestyle accessories, physiotherapy products, play and furniture using regular woodworking techniques. Value addition to the material is done by glue lamination transforming the packaging timber into solid timber sections with expensive feel and look. The constrained availability of the raw material calls for design of low quantity and high quality production. The paper presents product examples for different sections of the pyramid, designed and executed at design circle, Bangalore. The paper points the constraints, fresh avenues, sustainable practices in raw material procurement and in product design. The paper emphasizes the importance of re-purposing of a renewable, sustainable, material like timber after serving its originally intended purpose...|$|R
