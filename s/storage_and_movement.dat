50|$|Of equal {{importance}} to the <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> of water in soil is {{the means by which}} plants acquire it and their nutrients. Ninety percent of water is taken up by plants as passive absorption caused by the pulling force of water evaporating (transpiring) from the long column of water that leads from the plant's roots to its leaves. In addition, the high concentration of salts within plant roots creates an osmotic pressure gradient that pushes soil water into the roots. Osmotic absorption becomes more important during times of low water transpiration caused by lower temperatures (for example at night) or high humidity. It is the process that causes guttation.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the hypothesis of}} increased kidney cancer risk after exposure to hydrocarbons, especially those present in gasoline, we conducted a case-control study in a cohort of approximately 100, 000 male refinery workers from five petroleum companies. A review of 18, 323 death certificates identified 102 kidney cancer cases, to each of whom four controls were matched by refinery location and decade of birth. Work histories, containing an average of 15. 7 job assignments per subject, were found for 98 % of the cases and 94 % of the controls. To each job, industrial hygienists assigned semiquantitative ratings for the intensity and frequency of exposures to three hydrocarbon categories: nonaromatic liquid gasoline distillates, aromatic hydrocarbons, and the more volatile hydrocarbons. Ratings of "present" or "absent" were assigned for seven additional exposures: higher boiling hydrocarbons, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, asbestos, chlorinated solvents, ionizing radiation, and lead. Each exposure had either no association or a weak association with kidney cancer. For the hydrocarbon category of principal a priori interest, the nonaromatic liquid gasoline distillates, the estimated relative risk (RR) for any exposure above refinery background was 1. 0 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 5 - 1. 9). Analyses of cumulative exposures and of exposures in varying time periods before kidney cancer occurrence also produced null or near-null results. In {{an analysis of the}} longest job held by each subject (average duration 9. 2 years or 40 % of the refinery work history), three groups appeared to be at increased risk: laborers (RR = 1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 3. 9); workers in receipt, <b>storage,</b> <b>and</b> <b>movements</b> (RR = 2. 5, 95 % CI 0. 9 - 6. 6); and unit cleaners (RR = 2. 3, 95 % CI 0. 5 - 9. 9) ...|$|R
30|$|The {{main reason}} for reduced surface runoff in Eucalyptus {{plantations}} {{is believed to be}} canopy interception that leads <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> slowly <b>movement</b> of water in order to percolate to the ground. As the runoff study spatially limited to the local conditions, further multiple studies should be done. Otherwise, it could not be used to compare the results from different areas. In general, the expansion of Eucalyptus has no significant impact on surface runoff generation if it is expanded on previously grassland. However, it could also significantly reduce the surface runoff generated if it is planted on previously cultivated land. In addition, this study has also observed higher soil moisture under Eucalyptus woodlots than cultivated land. Depending the above observations, Eucalyptus can be used as area conservation tree, especially to reduce soil erosion by water, where high runoff recorded fields with consideration of tree planting spacing. The effect of proper Eucalyptus planting spacing and litter accumulation level on the runoff generation needs further studies in the country.|$|R

For an important class of algorithms the formalization of the different operations they perform lead to an unified treatment for them and may result in important simplifications. In this work we apply this point of view to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

40|$|AbstractThe <b>storage</b> {{potential}} <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> {{of fluids}} within a formation {{is dependent on}} hydraulic characterization unique to each depositional environment. Storage efficiency (E), {{the ratio of the}} injected volume of CO 2 to the accessible pore volume, quantifies the CO 2 storage capacity in a geologic depositional environment, providing a means to assess the CO 2 storage resource of candidate reservoirs. This paper quantifies the ranges for E via numerical modeling for eight depositional environments: deltaic, shelf clastic, shelf carbonate, fluvial deltaic, strandplain, reef, fluvial and alluvial, and turbidite. An important aspect of this work is the development of geologic and geocellular modeling that reflects the uniqueness of each depositional environment. Depositional environments were interpreted from core and geophysical log data; geologic and petrophysical data from oil fields <b>and</b> gas <b>storage</b> sites were used as constraints in the development of geocellular models, which were upscaled for flow simulations. Evaluation of the effects of geologic structures on storage efficiency indicates it causes a net increase in efficiency. Fluvial deltaic had the highest E and shelf carbonate had the lowest...|$|R

40|$|The {{unbounded}} {{increase in}} the computation and data requirements of scientific applica-tions has necessitated the use of widely distributed compute <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> resources to meet the demand. In such an environment, data is no more locally accessible and has thus to be remotely retrieved and stored. Efficient and reliable access to data sources and archiving destinations in a widely distributed environment brings new challenges. Placing data on temporary local storage devices offers many advantages, but such “data placements ” also require careful management of <b>storage</b> resources <b>and</b> data <b>movement,</b> i. e. allocating storage space, staging-in of input data, staging-out of generated data, and de-allocation of local storage after the data is safely stored at the destination. Existing systems closely couple data placement and computation, and consider data placement as {{a side effect of}} computation. Data placement is either embedded in the com-putation and causes the computation to delay, or performed as simple scripts which do not have the privileges of a job.

Consequently, changes in hydrology are the leading causes of wetland degradation or destruction.

Nevertheless, a study of aquifer properties will provide more relevant information on the aquifer characteristics of the terrain that controls the groundwater <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>movement.</b> Out of the hydraulic study methods, an in situ test {{is the most effective}} way to determine the hydraulic characteristics of water-bearing layers. This test allows hydrogeologists to quantify the groundwater and the hydraulic conductivity, which mainly depend on secondary porosity in the hard rock aquifer (Jain 1977). The hydraulic study of the aquifer performance test/pumping test is normally done in large-diameter wells in hard rock terrain, as they generally have more exposed fractures and fracture planes (Jain 1977; Aravindan et al. 2004; Bala et al. 2011).|$|E
