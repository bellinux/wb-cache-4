It has been recommended that pairs are isolated in the breeding season {{because they tend to}} get aggressive towards other birds during this time. Breeding activities usually start in March and go on until August. The hen lays 1 to 2 eggs which she incubates for 24 days. The young fletch when they are 70 to 77 days old.|$|E

50|$|Because {{they are}} highly sought after as pets, and because {{trapping}} of wild birds, which is now illegal, {{there has been a}} population decline. This has made them difficult to find. Panama amazons are extremely playful, can be excellent talkers, and tend to be loud at times; much like (nominate) yellow-crowned, double yellow-headed, and yellow-naped <b>amazon</b> <b>parrots.</b> Though their body-language is the same, Panama amazons are much less likely to become physically aggressive.

40|$|Introduction. The Red-tailed <b>Amazon</b> <b>parrot</b> (Amazona brasiliensis) is an {{endangered}} species of the Psittacine family, and for which various data are important for a comprehensive preservation plan. Data about plasma protein gel electrophoresis of <b>Amazon</b> <b>parrot</b> blood are scarce. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine plasma protein concentrations and concentrations of major protein bands in blood of young and adult Red-tailed <b>Amazon</b> <b>parrot</b> (Amazona brasiliensis). Materials and Methods. Blood samples from eight young and eight adult healthy free-living parrots were obtained. Plasma protein concentration and fractions were determined using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare variables. Results and Conclusions. Six major protein bands with the following molecular weights were identified by SDS-PAGE: 170 kDa, 117 kDa, 85 kDa (putative ovotransferrin), 60 kDa, 45 kDa and 23 kDa. Adult parrots had significantly higher concentrations of total proteins, albumin and other proteins with similar mobility (around 60 kDa). Young birds had significantly higher levels of 23 kDa proteins. The concentration of putative ovotransferrin (85 kDa) was not different between young and adult parrots. Plasma protein gel electrophoresis patterns in Red-tailed <b>Amazon</b> <b>parrots</b> are similar between young and adult animals, but specific protein bands differ in their absolute concentrations. This finding should be taken into consideration when clinical pathology data are analysed...|$|R
50|$|The {{twentieth century}} saw <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia's</b> gradual {{transition}} to self-governance. Representative government {{was introduced in}} 1924 when a constitution was established. Following the dissolution, <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia</b> immediately agreed to become an associated state of Britain, which entailed a mutually sanctioned relationship that could be dissolved at any time by either party. <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia</b> was granted full control over its local government, with Britain retaining responsibility for foreign affairs and national defense. This arrangement lasted until 1975, {{when members of the}} West Indies Associated States chose to pursue independence at their discretion and convenience (see: The West Indies Federation, ch. 1). Following three years of planning and deliberation, <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia</b> gained independence on February 22, 1979. <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia</b> achieved full independence in ceremonies boycotted by the opposition <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia</b> Labour Party, which had advocated a referendum before cutting ties with Britain. The United Workers Party (UWP), then in power, called for new elections and was defeated by the <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia</b> Labour Party (SLP). The UWP was returned to power in the elections of 1982, 1987, and 1992.The United Workers Party (UWP) was once the dominant force in the politics of <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia.</b> Until 1997, John Compton was premier of <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia</b> from 1964 until independence in February 1979 and remained prime minister until elections later that year.The <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia</b> Labour Party (SLP) won the first post-independence elections in July 1979, taking 12 of 17 seats in parliament.The United Workers Party won an upset victory in elections held December 11, 2006, taking 11 seats against 6 won by the <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia</b> Labour Party. Sir John Compton once again returned to the position of Prime Minister, as well as Minister of Finance.|$|R
