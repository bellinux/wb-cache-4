60|$|Having related these anecdotes in {{a natural}} manner, which was the best {{warranty}} {{in the world for}} their genuine nature, our friend Waterloo was sinking deep into his shawl again, as having exhausted his communicative powers and taken in enough east wind, when my other friend Pea in a moment brought him to the surface by asking whether he had not been occasionally the subject of assault and battery in the execution of his duty? Waterloo recovering his spirits, instantly dashed into a new branch of his subject. We learnt how 'both these teeth' - here he pointed to the places where two front teeth were not - were knocked out by an ugly customer who one night made a dash at him (Waterloo) while his (the ugly customer's) pal and coadjutor made a dash at the toll-taking apron where the money-pockets were; how Waterloo, letting the teeth go (to Blazes, he observed indefinitely), grappled with the apron- <b>seizer,</b> permitting the ugly one to run away; and how he saved the bank, and captured his man, and consigned him to fine and imprisonment. Also how, on another night, 'a Cove' laid hold of Waterloo, then presiding at the horse-gate of his bridge, and threw him unceremoniously over his knee, having first cut his head open with his whip. How Waterloo 'got right,' and started after the Cove all down the Waterloo Road, through Stamford Street, and round to the foot of Blackfriars Bridge, where the Cove 'cut into' a public-house. How Waterloo cut in too; but how an aider and abettor of the Cove's, who happened to be taking a promiscuous drain at the bar, stopped Waterloo; and the Cove cut out again, ran across the road down Holland Street, and where not, and into a beer-shop. How Waterloo breaking away from his detainer was close upon the Cove's heels, attended by no end of people, who, seeing him running with the blood streaming down his face, thought something worse was 'up,' and roared Fire! and Murder! on the hopeful chance of the matter in hand being one or both. How the Cove was ignominiously taken, in a shed where he had run to hide, and how at the Police Court they at first wanted to make a sessions job of it; but eventually Waterloo was allowed to be 'spoke to,' and the Cove made it square with Waterloo by paying his doctor's bill (W. was laid up for a week) and giving him 'Three, ten.' Likewise we learnt what we had faintly suspected before, that your sporting amateur on the Derby day, albeit a captain, can be - 'if he be,' as Captain Bobadil observes, 'so generously minded' - anything but a man of honour and a gentleman; not sufficiently gratifying his nice sense of humour by the witty scattering of flour and rotten eggs on obtuse civilians, but requiring the further excitement of 'bilking the toll,' and 'Pitching into' Waterloo, and 'cutting him about the head with his whip;' finally being, when called upon to answer for the assault, what Waterloo described as 'Minus,' or, as I humbly conceived it, not to be found. Likewise did Waterloo inform us, in reply to my inquiries, admiringly and deferentially preferred through my friend Pea, that the takings at the Bridge had more than doubled in amount, since the reduction of the toll one half. And being asked if the aforesaid takings included much bad money, Waterloo responded, with a look far deeper than the deepest part of the river, HE should think not! - and so retired into his shawl {{for the rest of the}} night.|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the safety and efficacy of simple DHCA and to outline the early outcomes especially the neurological ones. MethodsTwenty nine patients underwent surgical repair of congenital cardiac lesion with DHCA at a single institution from January 2010 to November 2015. DHCA was conducted with a target esophageal temperature of 18 ° and placement of an ice pack on the head. No selective perfusion was done. Demographic, operative and postoperative data were reviewed. Mortality, any neurological complications including <b>seizers,</b> coma, and stroke were recorded. ResultsThe mean age was 20. 6  ±  8. 2 months (range: 9  days to 154  months). The majority were males (20, 69 %). The mean weight was 5. 57  ±  4. 2  kg (range: 2. 3 – 17. 5  kg). DHCA time was 20. 03  min (range 3 – 52  min). There were three (10. 3 %) deaths. Two deaths occurred after Norwood operation, and one after interrupted aortic arch repair. None of the deaths were related to neurological injury. None of the patients developed <b>seizers,</b> coma, abnormal movement or neurological deficits.

40|$|Context: Most of the {{patients}} suffering from any neurological disorder pose ambulatory disturbance at any stage of disease which may result in falling without showing any warning sign and every patient is different from another. So {{there is a need}} to develop a mechanism to detect shaky motion. Objectives: The major objectives are: (i) To check different gait parameters in walking disorders using Shimmer platform (R). (ii) Wearing SHIMMER wireless sensors on hip, waist and chest, to check which one is the most suitable. (iii) To draw effective conclusion/results based on calibrated data in real time and offline processing in EyesWeb/Matlab. To develop an effective mechanism/algorithm for security warning and activating alarm systems. Methods: Our thesis project is related to analyze real-time gait of the patient suffering from Parkinson's disease for actively responding to the shaky movements. Based on real world data, we have developed a mechanism to monitor a real time gait analysis algorithm to detect any gait deviation. This algorithm is efficient, sensitive to detect miner deviation and not hard coded i. e. user can set Sampling Rate & Threshold values to analyze motion. Researchers can directly use this algorithm in their study without need to implement themselves. It works on pre-calculated threshold values while initial sampling rate is set to 100 MHz. Results: Accelerometers putting on the chest shows high unnecessary acceleration during fall, suggest putting on waist position. Also, if a patient initiates steps with energy, his/her gait may become more stable as shown in the conscious gait. Results show that after DBS surgical procedure, the patient still experiences postural instability with fall. So it is evident to show that such patients may have reduced cognition even after surgery. Another finding is that such patients may lean left or right during turning. Conclusions: We have presented a real time gait analysis algorithm, capable of detecting the motion of the patient with PD to actively respond to the shakier motion setting threshold values. Our proposed algorithm is easy to implement, reusable and can affectively generate healthcare alarms. Additionally, this system might be used by other researchers without the need to implement by themselves. The proposed method is sensitive to detect fall therefore objectively can be used for fall risk assessment as well. The same algorithm with minor modifications can be used for seizure detection in other disorders mainly epileptic <b>seizers</b> to alert health providers for emergency. Any malfunctioning of neurons in the nervous system is called Neurological disorder. Over 100 neurological disorders have been discovered throughout the world. In our study, we have chosen one disorder: Falling in Parkinson’s disease. Experiments can be performed on different gait parameters like body velocity, time ratio, ground slope, stance/swing, body gestures and gait patterns. Sensors can be put on hips, knees, thighs, limbs, neck, head, chest or any other suitable body part to capture motion data for further pre-and post-processing. Pre-processing is real time gait analysis through time domain and frequency domain to trigger various security steps and messages for patient care. Post -processing is offline analysis of motion data in different tools such as EyesWeb, BioMOBIUS and Matlab for calculations, analysis and plotting of motion to take decisions to formulate a mechanism for patient activity detection and monitoring. The area which we choose is pretty interesting, pertaining to rehabilitation, wellness and healthcare for older people. Other related keywords may include keywords may be helpful using one or combination of more than one. WSN, BAN or WBAN, biosensors, neurological disorders, gait analysis, fall detection, fall avoidance, Parkinson’s disease, wireless accelerometer, ambulatory monitoring, freezing of gait and fall risk assessment. Most of {{the patients}} suffering from any neurological disorder in later stages of disease pose ambulatory disturbance especially falling. Such patients may fall without showing any warning sign and every patient is different from another. So {{there is a need to}} develop a mechanism to detect shaky motion to avoid such patients from falling. Therefore, a real time gait analysis algorithm is implemented to trigger security alarms. In order to assess & evaluate gait analysis, accurate, reliable & consistent measurement tools need to be utilized. Even slight deviation in the data monitoring through measurement tools is not encouraged to use [21]. Gait disturbance can be measured using 3 axis accelerometers like SHIMMER(R) for real time motion analysis. In the wireless sensor network, SHIMMER platform provides wireless Body Area Network (BAN) to capture motion data. This data can be saved in CSV (Comma Separated Version) file for post processing or a 2 GB MicroSD card can be used to capture data in the SHIMMER accelerometer itself. The use of accelerometer is more suitable due to the fact that we are 66 capturing data from postural instability. One two or combinations of accelerometers can be put on different body parts. SHIMMER Gyroscope is more suitable for jerky motion with disease such as epilepsy. Mostly accelerometers and gyroscopes are used for gait analysis [4]. Defining our research work, this study is carried out on the patient with Parkinson’s disease (PD), to study various gait parameters, test wireless accelerometers on different body parts, and implementing an algorithm to trigger a security alarm system by setting a threshold value. Criteria for setting threshold value are calculating standard deviation and employed by different researchers like [3]. The main motivation to perform this experimental research work is to avoid the patient with PD from falling during unstable shaky gait. Security alarms can be activated whenever a patient poses a shakier gait. Two types of alarms or sirens can be activated in the lgorithm. First, to activate Warning Alarms when the value from motion data exceeds maximum threshold value 1 and second to activate Emergency Alarms when the value from motion data exceeds maximum threshold value 2. Later on airbag can be put on the patient’s hip position to avoid him/her from injury and hip fracture. The results show the proposed system is fairly simple to implement in the real time environment, flexible to adjust to any necessary change in the future. The major advantage of this algorithm is its reusability. Algorithm is not hard coded because a user can set his own sampling rate or threshold value or both, and check results. This algorithm is further modifiable to trigger airbag, a security push button, SOS calls, messages, siren activation system, automatic email forwarding, health care alert, and many more. The same algorithm with minor modifications can be used for fall avoidance or health care assurance on other disorders mainly in epileptic <b>seizers</b> to alert health providers in case of emergency, can be used for other seizures and disorders such as epilepsy, etc. Overall, this report presents the analysis of an experiment to measure the usability of wireless accelerometer data to monitor the activity of the patient suffering from Parkinson disease. Our research and experimental work can be quoted toward fall risk assessment. Inam-ul-Haq Lindblomsvagen 37233 Ronneby + 46 76060966...|$|R

The morphology of collected solid was characterized by SEM. The phase composition of collected solid was characterized by XRD. Laser particle <b>seizer</b> was used to study the particle size distribution. The results showed that temperature {{had little effect on}} the flotation efficiency. When pH value was 7, the lauryl amine adapts to neutral environment and the collecting effect of collector was the best, and cellulose was considered to be the best inhibitors in four different inhibitors. When volume fraction of lauryl amine, sodium humate flocculant, cellulose inhibitor, and temperature and pH value were 0. 16 %, 0. 16 %, 0. 25 ‰, 30 °C and 7, respectively, the solid collecting rate and collected SiC purity were respectively 51. 94 % and 94. 7 %...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{particle}} inception {{and early}} growth stages were investigated in an ethylene/air premixed flame by {{the evolution of}} the particle size and structure with flame residence time. Particle size distribution was measured by a scanning mobility particle <b>seizer</b> and chemical-physical investigation was carried out by Raman microspectroscopy, UV-visible light absorption and cyclic voltammetry. From early inception of particles, just downstream the flame front, to the formation of primary soot particles, in the post-oxidation flame zone, particles participate in a series of chemical and physical reactions that strongly modify their nanostructure and physicochemical properties, resulting in different optical and electronic characteristics. The results presented in this study show that the evolution from a mono-modal to a bi-modal size distribution is associated to a particle graphitization process consisting of a slight increase of the in plane average size of the polyaromatic units within the particles, La, and on the formation of stacks of polyaromatic planes. These outcomes suggest that in our flame conditions particle coagulation/coalescence has {{a major role in the}} initial soot formation, affecting both physical and chemical particle properties...|$|E
