40|$|Background Traditionally, {{stretching}} {{exercises are}} considered as basic components of warm up aiming {{to prepare the}} musculoskeletal system for performance and to prevent injuries. Objectives The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effects of different agonist and antagonist stretching arrangements within a pre-exercise warm-up on hip static (SROM) and dynamic range of motion (DROM). Materials and Methods Sixty trained male subjects (Mean ± SD: height, 177. 38 ± 6. 92 cm; body mass, 68. 4 ± 10. 22 kg; age, 21. 52 ± 1. 17 years) volunteered to participate in this study. SROM was measured by V-sit test and DROM captured by a motion analysis system before and after (i) static <b>stretching</b> <b>for</b> both hip flexor and extensor muscles (SFSE), (ii) dynamic <b>stretching</b> <b>for</b> both hip flexor and extensor muscles (DFDE), (iii) static <b>stretching</b> <b>for</b> the hip flexors and dynamic <b>stretching</b> <b>for</b> hip extensors (SFDE), and (iv) dynamic <b>stretching</b> <b>for</b> the hip flexors and static <b>stretching</b> <b>for</b> hip extensors (DFSE). Results DFSE showed a significantly higher increase in DROM and SROM than the remainder of the stretching protocols (P < 0. 05). There were significant differences between DFDE with SFSE and SFDE (P < 0. 05) and SFSE showed significant increase as compared to SFDE (P < 0. 05). Conclusions In conclusion, DFSE is probably the best stretching arrangement due to producing more post activation potentiation on agonist muscles and less muscle stiffness in antagonist muscles...|$|R
5|$|Murray {{started with}} the trading of Mike Fisher to the Nashville Predators in {{exchange}} for a first-round pick in the 2011 draft. Fisher already had a home in Nashville with new wife Carrie Underwood. The trading of Fisher, a fan favorite in Ottawa, lead to a small anti-Underwood backlash in the city with the banning of her songs from the play lists of some local radio stations. Murray next traded Chris Kelly, another veteran, to the Boston Bruins for a second-round pick in the 2011 draft. A few days later, pending unrestricted free agent Jarkko Ruutu was sent to the Anaheim Ducks {{in exchange for a}} sixth-round pick in 2011. A swap of goaltenders was made with the Colorado Avalanche which brought Craig Anderson to Ottawa in exchange for Brian Elliott. Both goalies were having sub-par seasons prior to the trade. Under-achieving forward Alex Kovalev was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins for a seventh-round draft pick. On trade deadline day, Ottawa picked up goaltender Curtis McElhinney on waivers, and traded Chris Campoli with a seventh-round pick to the Chicago Blackhawks for a second-round pick and Ryan Potulny. Goaltender Anderson played very well down the <b>stretch</b> <b>for</b> Ottawa, and the team quickly signed the soon-to-be unrestricted free agent to a four-year contract. After media speculation on the future of Murray within the organization, Murray was re-signed as general manager on April 8, to a three-year extension. On April 9, Head Coach Cory Clouston and assistants Greg Carvel and Brad Lauer were dismissed from their positions. Murray said that the decision was made {{based on the fact that}} the team entered the season believing it was a contender, but finished with a 32–40–10 record. Former Detroit Red Wings Assistant Coach Paul MacLean was hired as Clouston's replacement on June 14, 2011.|$|E

This was one of the conditions required by the Hesketh family when they made land available for development in the 19th century. Hesketh Park at the northern end of the town is named after them, having been built on land donated by Rev. Charles Hesketh.|$|E
25|$|Eversion and inversion: Stretching the {{eversion}} and inversion muscles {{allows for}} better {{range of motion}} to the ankle joint. Seated ankle elevations and depressions will stretch the peroneus and tibilalis muscles {{that are associated with}} these movements as they lengthen. Eversion muscles are stretched when the ankle becomes depressed from the starting position. In like manner, the inversion muscles are stretched when the ankle joint becomes elevated. Throughout this seated stretch, the ankle joint is to remain supported while depressed and elevated with the ipsilateral (same side) hand in order to sustain the <b>stretch</b> <b>for</b> 10–15 seconds. This stretch will increase overall eversion and inversion muscle group length and provide more flexibility to the ankle joint for larger range of motion during activity.|$|E

25|$|From the Gravesend basin, {{the canal}} {{began with a}} {{straight}} section aligned with New Tavern Fort, Gravesend. By 1801 it ran {{six and a half}} kilometres (four miles) to Higham. A new engineer, Ralph Walker, arrived and announced that the whole canal would cost significantly more than the revised estimate. Work halted, and by 1804 Dodd had probably left the project. Over the next few years, Walker suggested two new routes for the Higham to Strood <b>stretch,</b> <b>for</b> which Acts of Parliament were obtained and money raised. His second route was decided on but required a tunnel through the chalk hills; work on this did not start until 1819. The canal finally opened on 14 October 1824, by which time the Napoleonic wars were long over and the military need had greatly diminished. The canal had taken five Acts of Parliament and cost some £260,000.|$|E
