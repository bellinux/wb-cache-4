If the web speed is 1200 m/min and web width 8.5 m, the web moves 280 m during a scan, and the sensor moves the same distance diagonally across the web. The measurements are taken on the diagonal line and act as basis for profile (machine and cross-direction) and variation calculations. This value is subject to integration depending on the machine speed.

In this paper, we present a simplified sampling and detection method based on MWC structure by using the idea of blind source separation for mm wave communications, which can avoid the challenges of <b>signal</b> <b>sampling</b> brought by high frequencies and wide bandwidth for mm wave systems. This proposed method takes full advantage of the beneficial spectrum aliasing to achieve <b>signal</b> <b>sampling</b> at sub-Nyquist rate. Compared with the traditional MWC system, it provides the exact quantity of sampling channels which is far lower than that of MWC. In the reconstruction stage, the proposed method simplifies the computational complexity by exploiting simple linear operations instead of CS recovery algorithms and provides more stable performance of signal recovery. Moreover, MWC structure has the ability to apply to different bands used in mm wave communications by mixed processing, which is similar to spread spectrum technology...|$|E
