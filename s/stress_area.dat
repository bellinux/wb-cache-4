40|$|During the {{sovereign}} debt crisis investors rebalanced out of stressed and into non-stressed euro area countries, thereby {{contributing to the}} tensions in euro area financial markets. This paper examines the geographical pattern of this great rebalancing. Specifically, we test whether euro area and non-euro area investors adjusted their holdings of debt securities of euro <b>area</b> <b>stressed</b> and non-stressed countries dis-proportionately relative to benchmarks derived from a standard gravity model for portfolio choice. We find that non-euro area investors under-invested in <b>stressed</b> euro <b>area</b> countries, but did not over-invest in non-stressed euro area countries. As regards intra-euro area flows, we do not find evidence for a disproportionate slowdown of capital flows from non-stressed into <b>stressed</b> euro <b>area</b> countries. Instead, our results suggest that investors in <b>stressed</b> euro <b>area</b> countries disproportionately shifted capital into debt securities of non-stressed euro area countries. Finally, we find that both non-euro area investors' under-investment in stressed countries and <b>stressed</b> euro <b>area</b> investors' over-investment in non-stressed euro area countries ceased after {{the announcement of the}} ECB's OMT programme...|$|R

The measurement was done with the Neutron Diffraction Method using the Neutron Diffractometer DN 1 -M PSTBM BATAN. A number of 15 points with 45 measurement directions were conducted on the k area in normal, transversal and longitudinal directions. The result of the experiment showed 185 Mpa and 160 Mpa residual stress magnitude in longitudinal and transversal directions in the same directions with the weld toe welding between the web and flange with the extent of the <b>stress</b> <b>area</b> 8 times of the flange thickness. The perpendicular welding of the weld toe resulted in 162 Mpa and 145 Mpa residual stresses in longitudinal and transversal directions with 4 times <b>stress</b> <b>area</b> extent from the flange thickness. The residual stress magnitude and the width of <b>stress</b> <b>area</b> indicated the k area as a vulnerable area to the initial crack occurrence, which may decrease the link performance.

40|$|Objective　To {{explore the}} effect of hemodynamic factors on the {{pathogenesis}} and development of intracranial aneurysms. The fluid-structure interaction (FSI) between blood and vessel wall would {{be considered in the}} process. Methods　 Based on the data of volume CT digital subtraction angiography (VCTDSA) in a patient with intracranial aneurysms, a true 3 D model of intracranial aneurysms was obtained by 3 D reconstruction and segmentation in the Mimics 10. 0 software. The model was induced into ANSYS 14. 0 software, and the vessel wall model was constructed based on human physiology. Fluid model and vascular wall model of intracranial aneurysms were calculated and analyzed with fluid-structure interaction using the finite element method. Results　In a cardiac cycle, an obvious vortex flow was contantly found inside the aneurysm with low shear <b>stress</b> <b>area</b> at the top and high shear <b>stress</b> <b>area</b> at the neck of aneurysm. There are larger deformation and Von-Mises <b>stress</b> <b>area</b> at the top, body and neck of the aneurysm. Conclusion　By fluid-structure coupling numerical simulation to explore the blood flow characteristics and biomechanical properties of the wall of aneurysm, the possible region prone to rupture may be speculated, thus the rupture risk of aneurysm may be evaluated. This method can provide a technical support for further research of hemodynamics of intracranial aneurysm. 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2014. 11. 0...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} different stent parameters {{on the development of}} restenosis, so as to provide references and basis for the design of stent forms. Methods: Stents were categorized into groups according to stent unite length, strut number, strut cross-section diameter, stent depth into fluid, strut cross-section shape. The influence of different parameter settings on wall shear stress distributions was investigated based on three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. Results: The strut cross-section diameter had the most obvious impact on wall shear stress. It would lead to the increase of low wall shear <b>stress</b> <b>area</b> with shorter stent unite length, more strut number, larger strut cross-section diameter and deeper stent depth into the fluid. In comparison with triangular and square cross-section shape, the low shear <b>stress</b> <b>area</b> was much smaller by using stent with circular cross-section. Conclusions: It is suggested that the circular cross-section shape should be adopted in stent design, with preference to reducing strut cross-section diameter, strut number and stent depth into the fluid, while increasing stent unite length...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The stent {{is a major}} {{breakthrough}} {{in the treatment of}} coronary artery diseases. The permanent vascular implant of a stent, however, changes the intra-stent blood hemodynamics. There is a growing consensus that the stent implant may change the artery wall shear stress distribution and therefore trigger the restenosis process. Several studies have suggested that low shear stress, particularly the shear stress less than 5 dyne/cm 2, may lead to endothelial proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been widely used to analyze hemodynamics in stented arteries. In this paper, CFD models were developed to investigate the effects of cardiovascular stent design on the wall shear stress distribution in straight and curved arteries. Results show that the stent design pattern alone did not {{have a significant impact on}} the stent hemodynamics; however, stenting in curved arteries increased the low shear <b>stress</b> <b>area</b> which may lead to higher restenosis rate. The low shear <b>stress</b> <b>area</b> was almost doubled when the degree of artery curvature increased from 0 o to 90 o. The proposed methodology and findings will provide great insight for future optimization of stent design to reduce the risk of restenosis...|$|E

An unknown crack in blade roots or blade attachments {{can lead to}} a serious failure of the complete turbo generator set. Due to the high demand of power energy worldwide there is a strong demand to extend the calculated life of turbo generator sets. The extended operation cycle of turbines leads to the demand of advanced NDT methods, especially for highly <b>stressed</b> <b>areas</b> of turbine and generator rotors. The most critical ranges of a turbine rotor are the turbine blade roots as well as the turbine blade attachment grooves. The individual design of the turbine manufacturer require separate NDT methods for each blade root or blade attachment to be inspected.

40|$|Abstract:Slope {{stability}} {{is one of}} the problems of road construction which should be faced with and solve. Rainfall can reduce the shear strength of slope soil and raise the underground water level which can lead to increase slope soil pore water pressure. The influence of rainfall infiltration on slop is mainly to change the slope seepage field, increase dynamic and hydrostatic water load on the slope soil and decrease of soil shear parameters. More abundant rainfall of typhoon area could make the road slope stability more fragile. Based on Matoushan Mountain along 104 state roads in Taizhou city, Zhejiang province, slope instability disciplinarian on the condition of rainfall is studied using the method of numerical simulation in this paper.
