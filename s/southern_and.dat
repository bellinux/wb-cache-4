5|$|Black {{media outlets}} {{of the time}} praised the film, but the studio—fearful of a {{backlash}} from <b>Southern</b> <b>and</b> white film audiences—ended up cutting out controversial scenes, including the film's opening sequence at a slave auction (in which a mother is torn away from her baby).

5|$|Britain's {{remaining}} {{colonies in}} Africa, except for self-governing Southern Rhodesia, were all granted independence by 1968.

5|$|Expanding {{and moving}} out of their {{homeland}} in Scandinavia and northern Germany, the Germanic peoples had lived in today's Poland for several centuries, during which period many of their tribes also migrated out in the <b>southern</b> <b>and</b> eastern directions (see Wielbark culture). With {{the expansion of the}} Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes came under the Roman cultural influence. Some written remarks by Roman authors that are relevant to the developments on Polish lands have been preserved; they provide additional insight when compared with the archeological record. In the end, as the Roman Empire was nearing its collapse and the nomadic peoples invading from the east destroyed, damaged or destabilized the various Germanic cultures and societies, the Germanic people left eastern and central Europe for the safer and wealthier <b>southern</b> <b>and</b> western parts of the European continent.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, {{proposed}} {{reducing the}} five extant mainland area commands (North-Western, North-Eastern, Eastern, <b>Southern,</b> <b>and</b> Western Areas) to three. One of these would have been Northern Area, covering Queensland and the Northern Territory. The Australian Government rejected the plan and the wartime area command boundaries essentially remained in place until supplanted in 1953–54 by a functional command-and-control system made up of Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{controlled}} access highways on Hamersley's <b>southern</b> <b>and</b> western boundaries physically isolate the suburb from its neighbours and limit southbound exits to just two, Erindale Road and Wanneroo Road.

In 2004, Main Roads Western Australia provided a grant of $48,000 to the City of Stirling under its Black Spot Programme to improve the traffic flow in this area.|$|E
