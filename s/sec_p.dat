40|$|PURPOSE: To compare retinal {{arterio-venous}} {{circulation time}} by fluorescein (FA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) in birdshot chorioretinopathy. METHODS: We analyzed prolonged retinal arterio-venous fluorescein transit time, a known feature in birdshot chorioretinopathy and correlated it with ICGA findings in four consecutive patients. RESULTS: Mean retinal arterio-venous fluorescein circulation time was 31. 1 +/- 5. 2 seconds, a transit time significantly longer {{than in a}} group of ten patients with sarcoidosis (9. 45 +/- 3. 36 <b>sec.,</b> <b>p</b> < 0. 0001) and {{in a group of}} three cases with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (7. 0 +/- 1. 1 <b>sec.,</b> <b>p</b> < 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Prolonged fluorescein arterio-venous transit time seems to be a characteristic feature of birdshot chorioretinopathy that does however not reflect the actual intravascular hemodynamic situation but diffuse blood-retinal barrier damage allowing exudation, slow gradual tissue impregnation and delayed venous reabsorption of small molecules like fluorescein...|$|E

With recent advances in virtual reality simulation technology, simulated flexible sigmoidoscopes are available to family medicine residents for training before their initial and subsequent live patient examinations. The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine whether a virtual reality flexible sigmoidoscope simulator would improve the hand-eye skills and various performance parameters in a live patient. llethods: Residents were assigned to a control (n = 5) or experimental group (n = 5) in which the experimental group trained on a virtual reality sigmoidoscopy simulator before their first sigmoidoscopies on live patient volunteers. After the initial live patient sigmoidoscopies, both control and experimental groups trained on the simulator so that it was possible to evaluate presimulator and postsimulator training effects on live patient performance and to compare speed and skill between the groups at different levels of training. Results: Training on the virtual reality simulator produced substantial improvements in examination times and hand-eye skill measures. After 6 to 10 hours of training on the simulator, the experimental group achieved significantly faster insertion times to 30 em (119 versus 357 <b>sec,</b> <b>P</b> = 0. 03), 40 em (211 versus 518 <b>sec,</b> <b>P</b> = 0. 03), and a shorter mean length of examination (323 versus 654 <b>sec,</b> <b>P</b> = 0. 01).

40|$|Objectives: Premature Ejaculation (PE), the commonest sexual {{dysfunction}} in males, is generally treated with local anesthetic and SSRI (Dapoxetine). The aim {{of our study}} was investigate Group Psychotherapy as an alternative treatment for PE and compare the efficacy of pharmacological treatment and psychotherapy, either alone or in combination, in terms of response and improved Quality of Life (QoL). From a male outpatient population screened for PE, those who received a diagnosis of PE were proposed for the study, enrolled and divided into 3 groups (A, B and C). Each group was treated with Dapoxetine, Group Psychotherapy alone and Dapoxetine and Group Psychotherapy, respectively. Materials and methods: Out of 1237 male outpatients, 353 received a diagnosis of Premature Ejaculation. Of them, 279 {{were enrolled in the}} study and randomized into 3 groups (A, B and C). Only 157 patients were evaluable. Before and after treatments all participants completed two questionnaires to evaluate PE status and anxiety and referred their IELT. Results: GROUP A: The mean post-treatment Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT) score decreased from 12. 95 to 8. 26, while the mean Intra-vaginal Ejaculation Latency Time (IELT) increased from 50. 77 sec to 203 <b>sec.</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 05); GROUP B: Reduction in the mean PEDT from 13. 44 to 5. 11 and an increased IELT from 48. 33 to 431. 11 <b>sec</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 001); GROUP C: The mean post-treatment PEDT score decreased from 12. 29 to 5. 57, while the mean IELT increased from 46. 86 to 412. 14 <b>sec</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 001).

An open access technique through the umbilical cicatrix tube {{has been developed}} as a routine method with the goal to be easy, safe and used by all surgeons in patients without a previous midline incision. AIM: To evaluate the open technique in a prospective study in 100 consecutive laparoscopic operations regarding time for entrance, surgeons experience and BMI of the patients. METHODS: A midline incision from the linea alba up into the inverted umbilicus was performed in the cicatrix tube and the peritoneum was penetrated allowing air to flow into the abdominal cavity followed by a blunt trocar insertion. RESULTS: Time for access was median 93 seconds. Entrance time in patients with BMI > 30 (n= 18) was 100 sec and with BMI < 30 it was 90 <b>sec</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 71). The median time for consultants was 88 sec and for residents 120 <b>sec</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 003). No gas leakage was seen. Prolonged time for access was seen in three patients; two equipment failures and one obese patent. CONCLUSION: The open access technique is applicable in all patients without a former midline incision. It is fast, easy to learn with very few associated problems...|$|E
40|$|Na+/H+ {{exchange}} {{activity and}} NHE- 3 expression in renal tubules from the spontaneously hypertensive rat. BackgroundThe NHE- 3 isoform of the Na+/H+ antiporter, in the apical membrane of renal proximal tubule, {{is responsible for}} the bulk transport of Na+ and fluid reabsorption. Studies have reported that apical NHE- 3 translocates to internal pools, thereby facilitating natriuresis when blood pressure increases abruptly. MethodsThe present study examined Na+/H+ exchange activity and NHE- 3 expression in renal cortical tubules from the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and WKY rats before and after the development of hypertension. SHR 4 to 6 weeks of age were pre-hypertensive, 6 to 7 weeks old had mild hypertension, and 8 to 13 weeks old had severe hypertension. Renal proximal tubules (PTs) were isolated and purified by Percoll gradient centrifugation. NHE- 3 protein and mRNA levels were determined by Western and Northern blots, respectively. Apical brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) were prepared using the MgSO 4 aggregation method and Na+/H+ exchange activity assessed using the acridine orange method. ResultsNa+/H+ exchange activity, determined as the rate of Na+-dependent intracellular pH (pHi) recovery assessed using BCECF after an acute acid load, was significantly greater in PTs from SHR than in WKY rats at all age groups (4 to 6 weeks, 0. 30 ± 0. 04 vs. 0. 24 ± 0. 02 pH U/ 30 <b>sec,</b> <b>P</b> < 0. 05; 6 to 7 weeks, 0. 42 ± 0. 07 vs. 0. 29 ± 0. 05 pH U/ 30 <b>sec,</b> <b>P</b> < 0. 05; and 8 to 13 weeks, 0. 48 ± 0. 07 vs. 0. 40 ± 0. 07 pH U/ 30 <b>sec,</b> <b>P</b> < 0. 05). The Na+-dependent recovery in BBMV was also greater in SHR than WKY rats (1464 ± 62 vs. 1042 ± 79 fluorescence. U/ 5 <b>sec,</b> <b>P</b> < 0. 001) and was unaffected by cariporide, a specific NHE- 1 inhibitor. NHE- 3 protein levels also were significantly higher in SHR than age-matched WKY rats at all stages during the development of hypertension (pre-hypertensive 1. 8 -fold; early onset hypertension twofold; established hypertension 1. 5 -fold; each P < 0. 05). By contrast, NHE- 3 mRNA levels were not different between SHR and WKY rats at each age group. ConclusionsNa+/H+ exchange activity and NHE- 3 protein abundance in renal proximal tubules from the SHR are increased while NHE- 3 mRNA is not. A post-transcriptional event(s) best explains the increase in NHE- 3 protein expression since mRNA levels were not increased. The alterations in the SHR antedate the development of hypertension and fail to decrease as blood pressure increases with age in the SHR, which likely results in inappropriate renal sodium retention {{in the face of a}} chronic rise in blood pressure...|$|E

40|$|Activation of the rab GTPase, <b>Sec</b> 4 <b>p,</b> by its {{exchange}} factor, <b>Sec</b> 2 <b>p,</b> {{is needed}} for polarized transport of secretory vesicles to exocytic sites and for exocytosis. A small region in the C-terminal half of <b>Sec</b> 2 <b>p</b> regulates its localization.

Here, we show that <b>Sec</b> 2 <b>p</b> associates with the exocyst, an octameric effector of <b>Sec</b> 4 <b>p</b> involved in tethering secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane.

RESULTS: The mean EELV change between baseline and EPAP was only 13. 3 mL (range 2 - 25 mL). Expiratory time was significantly increased with EPAP compared to baseline 2. 64 +/- 0. 54 vs 2. 16 +/- 0. 64 <b>sec</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 002). Total respiratory time was longer with EPAP than at baseline 4. 44 +/- 1. 47 sec vs 3. 73 +/- 0. 88 <b>sec</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 3), and minute ventilation was lower with EPAP vs baseline 7. 9 +/- 4. 17 L/min vs 9. 05 +/- 2. 85 L/min (P = 0. 3).

We compared two fiberscopes in patients with authentic difficult airways. Methods: In this randomized, controlled clinical trial, 40 patients (grade 3 according to grades of difficulty in laryngoscopy), scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia were randomly allocated to BIF-DL group or FOB-DL group. Number of attempts, time required for visualization of the vocal cord (T 1) and placement of the endotracheal tube (T 2) from insertion of instrument during the last successful attempt, and duration of scope manipulation during all attempts (Ttotal) were recorded. If intubation failed with one method, the other method was tried; these cases were then excluded. The incidence of sore throat and hoarseness was assessed. Results: T 1, T 2, and Ttotal were significantly shorter in BIF-DL group (T 1 : 21. 9 ± 8. 2 sec vs. 80. 4 ± 29. 9 <b>sec,</b> <b>P</b> < 0. 001, Ttotal: 77. 9 ± 41. 2 sec vs. 145. 5 ± 83. 9 <b>sec,</b> <b>P</b> = 0. 003).

Palmar SSRs were elicited by electrical stimulation of 20. 0 mA for 0. 2 ms applied in random sequence to cervical and thoracic dermatomes, cor-responding to regions {{above and below the}} levels of injury. Unexpectedly, responses were obtained from both stimulation sites in fifteen of sixteen quadriplegics, and stimulation site did not significantly affect SSR amplitude. Following cervical stimulation, mean patient amplitudes were 77 % less than controls (599 vs. 2549 &mu;V, p =. 0002) and laten-cies 62 % greater (2. 33 vs. 1. 44 <b>sec,</b> <b>p</b> =. 04).

40|$|To {{investigate}} the peripheral vascular reactivity {{in patients with}} hypertension (HT) hypercholesterolemia (HC) or diabetes melitus (DM), one minute postocclusive reactive hyperemia (PORH) response of the radical artery by pulsed Doppler echography was assessed. Subjects were 10 patients with HT, 8 patients eith HC, 8 patients with DM, and 19 control subjects [11 older controls (Group O) and 8 younger controls (Group Y) ] without HT, HC nor DM. Ages were matched between Groups O, HT, HC and DM. The pulsed Doppler indices were time to peak response (Tp) and recovery half-time (T 1 / 2) of time-velocity integral of the radial arterial flow velocity signals. Also, the percent increase of the radial arterinal diameter from rest (%ΔD) was determined on a color flow imaging. Tp was significantly longer in Group O (2. 3 ± 0. 3 sec) than in Group Y (1. 4 ± 0. 1 <b>sec)</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 05). Also, T 1 / 2 was significantly longer in Group O (7. 4 ± 0. 9 sec) than group Y (4. 3 ± 0. 5 <b>sec)</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 05). These data suggested that the early PORH response was prolonged and the reactivity of the resistance vessels was impaired with aging. Then, %ΔDs of HT, HC and DM groups were compared that of Group O. %ΔD was significantly smaller in HT group than group O within the initial 30 seconds after reperfusion, and significantly smaller in HC group until 3 minutes after reperfusion (p < 0. 05). DM group was not different from group O in %ΔD. These results suggested that flow-mediated dilation of the radial artery during PORH response was impaired in the HT and HC groups. Thus, the analyses of the PORH response using Doppler echogram and color flow imaging were useful for evaluation of peripheral vascular reactivity in the radial artery...|$|E
40|$|Trafficking {{of protein}} and lipid cargo through the {{secretory}} pathway in eukaryotic cells is mediated by membrane-bound vesicles. Secretory vesicles are targeted to sites of exocytosis on the plasma membrane {{in part by}} a conserved multi-subunit protein complex termed the exocyst. In addition to tethering vesicles to the plasma membrane, the exocyst complex and components therein may also add a layer of regulation by directly controlling assembly of the SNARE complex, which is required for membrane fusion, as well as other regulatory factors such as <b>Sec</b> 1 <b>p.</b> In the past, we have shown that <b>Sec</b> 6 <b>p</b> interacts with <b>Sec</b> 9 <b>p</b> in vivo and that that interaction retards binary SNARE complex formation in a SNARE assembly assay. Though many interactions have been mapped using in vitro methods, confirming them in vivo and placing them into the context of a complete model that accounts for all observed interactions (and lack of interactions) has proven difficult. In order to address these problems, I have studied the interactions between <b>Sec</b> 6 <b>p</b> and other factors involved in exocytosis at the plasma membrane via in vivo methods. My hypothesis was that <b>Sec</b> 6 <b>p</b> interaction with <b>Sec</b> 9 <b>p</b> and subsequent inhibition of SNARE complex assembly in vitro was an intermediate state and <b>Sec</b> 6 <b>p</b> was part of a set of cofactors that accelerated SNARE complex assembly in vivo. To test this hypothesis I showed that the interaction between the plasma membrane t-SNARE <b>Sec</b> 9 <b>p</b> and the yeast exocyst subunit <b>Sec</b> 6 <b>p</b> can be observed in vivo and designed point mutations to disrupt that interaction. Interestingly, I also showed that Sec 6 p:Sec 9 p interaction involves the free pool of <b>Sec</b> 6 <b>p</b> rather than the exocyst bound fraction of <b>Sec</b> 6 <b>p.</b> Point mutations in the N-terminal domain of <b>Sec</b> 6 <b>p</b> result in temperature sensitive growth and secretion defects, without loss of Sec 6 p-Sec 9 p interaction. However, at the non-permissive temperature, the exocyst subunits <b>Sec</b> 5 <b>p,</b> <b>Sec</b> 10 <b>p</b> and <b>Sec</b> 15 <b>p</b> are mislocalized and are absent from the exocyst complex. The resulting subcomplex, containing <b>Sec</b> 3 <b>p,</b> <b>Sec</b> 8 <b>p,</b> Exo 70 p and Exo 84 p, remains stably assembled and localized at sites of polarized secretion. This subcomplex is likely due to disruption of interaction between <b>Sec</b> 6 <b>p</b> and <b>Sec</b> 5 <b>p,</b> and may be similar to that observed at restrictive temperatures in the sec 6 - 54 temperature sensitive mutant.

We aimed to (1) explore the association of REM-related EMG activity (REMREEA) with OSA in RBD patients; (2) compare the severity of OSA between RBD patients with OSA (RBD-OSA) and their age-, sex-, AHI-, and BMI- matched OSA controls. Design: a. Correlation study in consecutive RBD subjects and b. case-control study Setting: Sleep laboratory Participants: 71 RBD patients in the correlation study and 55 subjects (28 RBD-OSA cases and 27 OSA controls) in the case-control study. Intervention: N/A Methods: Polysomnographic assessment to document the sleep architecture, sleep apnea related parameters, and REMREEA. Results: (1) In the correlation study, increased REMREEA was associated with lower severity of OSA in RBD patients, including total AHI (r = - 0. 263), NREM AHI (r = - 0. 242), obstructive AHI (r = - 0. 265), and mean apnea duration (r = - 0. 353) (P < 0. 05). (2) In the case-control study, RBD-OSA patients had lesser severity of sleep apnea parameters than OSA controls in terms of higher nadir SpO 2 (85. 7 % ± 4. 9 % vs 80. 8 % ± 5. 9 %, P < 0. 01), shorter maximum hypopnea duration (53. 8 ± 16. 7 vs 69. 4 ± 22. 4 seconds, P < 0. 05), and maximum (45. 8 ± 20. 5 vs 60. 8 ± 19. 6 <b>sec,</b> <b>P</b> < 0. 01) and mean apnea duration (22. 3 ± 8. 1 vs 26. 3 ± 5. 8 <b>sec,</b> <b>P</b> < 0. 05). Significant interaction effects indicated that the usual REM sleep exacerbation of sleep apneas was seen only in OSA controls but not in RBD subjects.

40|$|Introduction: Adverse {{cognitive}} outcomes after {{cardiac surgery}} {{are the results}} of multifactorial intraoperative factors (i. e., cerebral hypoperfusion or embolization) mostly related to cardiopulmonary bypass. Neurophysiological Monitoring (NM) can intraoperatively detect the potential ischemic injury and contribute to reduce cognitive decline after cardiac surgery. Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of intraoperative NM in reducing postoperative cognitive decline {{as a consequence of}} brain ischemia in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods: We retrospectively selected 32 patients underwent intraoperative NM and 32 without NM matched for preoperative level of education and risk-stratification score. Both groups were administered a neuropsychological assessment before and after cardiac surgery to evaluate attention, memory and language. It included the Trail Making Test A and B (TMT A/B), Memory with Interference 10 and 30 seconds, Phonemic Fluency and Digit Span Test. Statistical analyses were performed using the exact Mann-Whitney U Test. Results: Both groups did not differ in age (p = 0. 46), years of education (p = 0. 34) and risk-stratification score (p = 0. 84). Moreover, no significant differences were observed in preoperative scores of TMT A (p = 0. 07), TMT B (p = 0. 07), Memory with Interference 10 (p = 0. 75) and 30 <b>sec</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 83), Phonemic Fluency (p = 0. 32) and Digit Span Test (p = 0. 19). NM group postoperatively exhibited a significant better performance in TMT B (p< 0. 03) and Digit Span Test (p < 0. 05) compared to group without NM. No significant differences were obtained in postoperative scores of TMT A (p = 0. 08), Memory with Interference 10 (p = 0. 68) and 30 <b>sec</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 34) and Phonemic Fluency (p = 0. 15). Conclusion: Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring enables early detection of events associated with brain ischemic damage; it might also represents an useful procedure in order to reduce postoperative cognitive decline and to improve functional outcome of patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{goals of}} the current study were to compare leg blood flow, oxygen {{extraction}} and oxygen uptake (VO 2) after constant load sub-maximal unilateral knee extension (ULKE) exercise in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) compared to those with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Previously, {{it has been shown that}} prolonged whole body VO 2 recovery kinetics are directly related to disease severity and all-cause mortality in HFrEF patients. To date, no study has simultaneously measured muscle-specific blood flow and oxygen extraction post exercise recovery kinetics in HFrEF or HFpEF patients; therefore it is unknown if muscle VO 2 recovery kinetics, and more specifically, the recovery kinetics of blood flow and oxygen extraction at the level of the muscle, differ between HF phenotypes. Ten older (68 ± 10 yrs) HFrEF (n = 5) and HFpEF (n = 5) patients performed sub-maximal (85 % of maximal weight lifted during an incremental test) ULKE exercise for 4 minutes. Femoral venous blood flow and venous O 2 saturation were measured continuously from the onset of end-exercise, using a novel MRI method, to determine off-kinetics (mean response times, MRT) for leg VO 2 and its determinants. HFpEF and HFrEF patients had similar end-exercise leg blood flow (1. 1 ± 0. 6 vs. 1. 2 ± 0. 6 L/min, p> 0. 05), venous saturation (42 ± 12 vs. 41 ± 11 %, p> 0. 05) and VO 2 (0. 13 ± 0. 08 vs. 0. 11 ± 0. 05 L/min, p> 0. 05); however HFrEF had significantly delayed recovery MRT for flow (292 ± 135 sec. vs 105 ± 63 <b>sec.,</b> <b>p</b> = 0. 004) and VO 2 (95 ± 37 sec. vs. 47 ± 15 <b>sec.,</b> <b>p</b> = 0. 005) compared to HFpEF.

Since COPII proteins {{are involved in}} this transport pathway, we investigated at the biochemical level post-translational modifications of COPII components during the course of mitosis that could be linked to inhibition of ER-to-Golgi transport. By comparing biochemical properties of cytosolic COPII components during interphase and mitosis, we found that <b>Sec</b> 24 <b>p</b> isoforms underwent post-translational modifications resulting in an increase in their apparent molecular weight. No such modification was observed for the other COPII components <b>Sec</b> 23 <b>p,</b> <b>Sec</b> 13 <b>p,</b> <b>Sec</b> 31 <b>p</b> or Sar 1 p.

40|$|SEC 2 is an {{essential}} gene required for polarized growth of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Activation of <b>Sec</b> 4 <b>p</b> by <b>Sec</b> 2 <b>p</b> is needed for polarized transport of vesicles to exocytic sites. Temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations in sec 2 and sec 4 result in a tight block in secretion and the accumulation of secretory vesicles randomly distributed in the cell. The proper localization of <b>Sec</b> 2 <b>p</b> to secretory vesicles is essential for its function and is largely independent of <b>Sec</b> 4 <b>p.</b> Although the ts mutation sec 2 - 78 does not affect nucleotide exchange activity, the protein is mislocalized. Here we present evidence that Ypt 31 / 32 p, members of Rab family of GTPases, regulate <b>Sec</b> 2 <b>p</b> function. First, YPT 31 /YPT 32 suppress the sec 2 - 78 mutation.

40|$|Background Cardiac arrests {{are handled}} by teams {{rather than by}} {{individual}} health-care workers. Recent investigations demonstrate that adherence to CPR guidelines can be less than optimal, that deviations from treatment algorithms are associated with lower survival rates, and that deficits in performance are associated with shortcomings {{in the process of}} team-building. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore and quantify the effects of ad-hoc team-building on the adherence to the algorithms of CPR among two types of physicians that play an important role as first responders during CPR: general practitioners and hospital physicians. Methods To unmask team-building this prospective randomised study compared the performance of preformed teams, i. e. teams that had undergone their process of team-building prior to the onset of a cardiac arrest, with that of teams that had to form ad-hoc during the cardiac arrest. 50 teams consisting of three general practitioners each and 50 teams consisting of three hospital physicians each, were randomised to two different versions of a simulated witnessed cardiac arrest: the arrest occurred either in the presence of only one physician while the remaining two physicians were summoned to help ("ad-hoc"), or it occurred in the presence of all three physicians ("preformed"). All scenarios were videotaped and performance was analysed post-hoc by two independent observers. Results Compared to preformed teams, ad-hoc forming teams had less hands-on time during the first 180 seconds of the arrest (93 ± 37 vs. 124 ± 33 <b>sec,</b> <b>P</b> < 0. 0001), delayed their first defibrillation (67 ± 42 vs. 107 ± 46 <b>sec,</b> <b>P</b> < 0. 0001), and made less leadership statements (15 ± 5 vs. 21 ± 6, P < 0. 0001). Conclusion Hands-on time and time to defibrillation, two performance markers of CPR with a proven relevance for medical outcome, are negatively affected by shortcomings in the process of ad-hoc team-building and particularly deficits in leadership. Team-building has thus to be regarded as an additional task imposed on teams forming ad-hoc during CPR.
