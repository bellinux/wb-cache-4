5|$|Sexual {{intercourse}} is {{the major}} mode of HIV transmission. Both X4 and R5 HIV {{are present in the}} <b>seminal</b> <b>fluid,</b> which is passed from a male to his sexual partner. The virions can then infect numerous cellular targets and disseminate into the whole organism. However, a selection process leads to a predominant transmission of the R5 virus through this pathway. In patients infected with subtype B HIV-1, there is often a co-receptor switch in late-stage disease and T-tropic variants appear that can infect a variety of T cells through CXCR4. These variants then replicate more aggressively with heightened virulence that causes rapid T cell depletion, immune system collapse, and opportunistic infections that mark the advent of AIDS. Thus, during the course of infection, viral adaptation to the use of CXCR4 instead of CCR5 may be a key step in the progression to AIDS. A number of studies with subtype B-infected individuals have determined that between 40 and 50 percent of AIDS patients can harbour viruses of the SI and, it is presumed, the X4 phenotypes.|$|E
25|$|In organisms, sexual {{selection}} extends past differential reproduction to affect sperm composition, sperm competition, and ejaculate size. Males of C. lectularius allocate 12% of their sperm and 19% of their <b>seminal</b> <b>fluid</b> per mating. Due to these findings, Reinhard et. al proposed that multiple mating {{is limited by}} <b>seminal</b> <b>fluid</b> and not sperm. After measuring ejaculate volume, mating rate and estimating sperm density, Reinhardt et al. showed that mating could be limited by <b>seminal</b> <b>fluid.</b> Despite these advances, the cost difference between ejaculate-dose dependence and mating frequency dependence have not been explored.|$|E

Isolating or washing gametes in salt solutions similar to the accompanying medium did not alter their fertility. On the contrary, the fertilization rate was lower when ova and spermatozoa were washed before insemination. Fertilizability was considerably lower for ova washed exclusively in media with NaCl or low osmotic pressure. The paper discusses some protein factors in the coelomic and <b>seminal</b> <b>fluids</b> which may have a protector effect on gametes, especially spermatozoa...|$|R
40|$|Female moths {{often become}} {{depleted}} of sex pheromone after mating as the various components of virgin behavior are switched off. In examining a potential male contribution to these {{events in the}} corn earworm moth Helicoverpa zea, we have characterized a basic polypeptide from the tissues producing (accessory glands) and storing (duplex) the <b>seminal</b> <b>fluids.</b> The peptide evokes the depletion of sex pheromone when injected into virgin females. This pheromonostatic peptide (PSP) is 57 amino acids long and contains a single disulfide bridge. It is blocked at the N terminus with pyroglutamate and at the C terminus by amidation. As little as 23 ng of peptide evokes the near-complete depletion of pheromone in decapitated (neck-ligated) females that had been injected with pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide. Activity is approximately 15 -fold less in intact virgins, showing that the head limits the expression of activity in these injected females. Females mated to surgically impaired males, capable of producing a spermatophore but not transferring spermatozoa or <b>seminal</b> <b>fluids,</b> are depleted of pheromone by injected peptide. Females whose abdominal nerve cords have been severed are not depleted of pheromone after mating. Thus, neural signals either descending or ascending via the nerve cord are required for the depletion of pheromone after mating. PSP, from the <b>seminal</b> <b>fluids,</b> may participate in this process by direct or indirect action on the glandular tissue; if so, it represents an unusual mechanism in insects for the regulation by <b>seminal</b> <b>fluids</b> of postmating reproductive behavior...|$|R
25|$|In vitro {{studies have}} shown that sperm {{expelled}} together with <b>seminal</b> vesicular <b>fluid</b> show poor motility and survival, and the sperm chromatin is less protected. Therefore, the exact physiological importance of <b>seminal</b> vesicular <b>fluid</b> is not clear.|$|R
25|$|Males of {{some species}} use bodily fluids, such as <b>seminal</b> <b>fluid</b> from their ejaculate, {{to aid in}} the {{coercion}} of females. <b>Seminal</b> <b>fluid</b> in males of Drosophila melanogaster may contain chemicals that increase the amount of time it takes for females to remate, decrease the length of successive matings, or keep her from remating at all. The less a female mates with other males after copulation with a male, {{the more likely it is}} for him to ensure his paternity. These chemicals may also serve to increase the female’s reproductive success, but at the cost of decreased longevity and immune response.|$|E
25|$|During this phase, {{the male}} {{urethral}} sphincter contracts (so as to prevent urine from mixing with semen, and {{to guard against}} retrograde ejaculation) and muscles {{at the base of}} the penis begin a steady rhythmic contraction. Males may start to secrete <b>seminal</b> <b>fluid</b> or pre-ejaculatory fluid and the testicles rise closer to the body.|$|E
25|$|In Xylocoris maculipennis, after a male traumatically inseminates another male, the {{injected}} sperm {{migrate to}} the testes. (The <b>seminal</b> <b>fluid</b> {{and most of the}} sperm are digested, giving the inseminated male a nutrient-rich meal.) It has been suggested, although there is no evidence, that when the inseminated male ejaculates into a female, the female receives both males' sperm.|$|E
50|$|In {{males and}} females, both {{internal}} and external urethral sphincters function to inhibit the release of urine. In males, the internal sphincter muscle of urethra functions to prevent reflux of <b>seminal</b> <b>fluids</b> into the male bladder during ejaculation.|$|R
40|$|Mating {{with more}} than one male is the norm for females of many species. In {{addition}} to generating competition between the ejaculates of different males, multiple mating may allow females to bias sperm use. In Drosophila melanogaster, the last male to inseminate a female sires approximately 80 % of subsequent progeny. Both sperm displacement, where resident sperm are removed from storage by the incoming ejaculate of the copulating male, and sperm incapacitation, where incoming <b>seminal</b> <b>fluids</b> supposedly interfere with resident sperm, have been implicated in this pattern of sperm use. But the idea of incapacitation is problematic because there are no known mechanisms by which an individual could damage rival sperm and not their own. Females also influence the process of sperm use, but exactly how is unclear. Here we show that <b>seminal</b> <b>fluids</b> do not kill rival sperm and that any 'incapacitation' is probably due to sperm ageing during sperm storage. We also show that females release stored sperm from the reproductive tract (sperm dumping) after copulation with a second male and that this requires neither incoming sperm nor <b>seminal</b> <b>fluids.</b> Instead, males may cause stored sperm to be dumped or females may differentially eject sperm from the previous mating...|$|R

25|$|In many species, <b>seminal</b> <b>fluid</b> {{can be used}} as a sort of mating plug.

25|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} {{associated}} with urinary dysfunction as the prostate gland surrounds the prostatic urethra. Changes within the gland, therefore, directly affect urinary function. Because the vas deferens deposits <b>seminal</b> <b>fluid</b> into the prostatic urethra, and secretions from the prostate gland itself are included in semen content, prostate cancer may also cause problems with sexual function and performance, such as difficulty achieving erection or painful ejaculation.|$|E

25|$|The {{carnitine}} {{content of}} <b>seminal</b> <b>fluid</b> {{is directly related}} to sperm count and motility, suggesting that the compound might be of value in treating male infertility. Several studies indicate that carnitine supplementation (2–3 grams/day for 3–4 months) may improve sperm quality, and one randomized, double-blind crossover trial found that 2 grams/day of carnitine taken for 2 months by 100 infertile men increased the concentration and both total and forward motility of their sperm. The reported benefits may relate to increased mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation (providing more energy for sperm) and reduced cell death in the testes.|$|E

It was later shown that many other tissues secrete prostaglandins for various functions. The first total syntheses of prostaglandin F2α and prostaglandin E2 were reported by E. J.

25|$|PSA {{was first}} {{identified}} by researchers attempting {{to find a}} substance in <b>seminal</b> <b>fluid</b> that would aid {{in the investigation of}} rape cases. PSA is now used to indicate the presence of semen in forensic serology. The semen of adult males has PSA levels far in excess of those found in other tissues; therefore, a high level of PSA found in a sample is an indicator that semen may be present. Because PSA is a biomarker that is expressed independently of spermatozoa, it remains useful in identifying semen from vasectomized and azoospermic males.|$|E
25|$|Primary sex {{characteristics}} are those {{directly related to}} the sex organs. In males, the first stages of puberty involve growth of the testes and scrotum, followed by growth of the penis. At the time that the penis develops, the seminal vesicles, the prostate, and the bulbourethral gland also enlarge and develop. The first ejaculation of <b>seminal</b> <b>fluid</b> generally occurs about one year after the beginning of accelerated penis growth, although this is often determined culturally rather than biologically, since for many boys first ejaculation occurs as a result of masturbation. Boys are generally fertile before they have an adult appearance.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} of the prostate is to secrete a slightly alkaline fluid, milky or white in appearance, that in humans usually constitutes roughly 30% {{of the volume of}} the semen along with spermatozoa and <b>seminal</b> vesicle <b>fluid.</b> Semen is made alkaline overall with the secretions from the other contributing glands, including, at least, the <b>seminal</b> vesicle <b>fluid.</b> The alkalinity of semen helps neutralize the acidity of the vaginal tract, prolonging the lifespan of sperm. The prostatic fluid is expelled in the first ejaculate fractions, together with most of the spermatozoa. In comparison with the few spermatozoa expelled together with mainly <b>seminal</b> vesicular <b>fluid,</b> those expelled in prostatic fluid have better motility, longer survival and better protection of the genetic material.|$|R

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 10% of all birth defects are caused by prenatal exposure to a teratogenic agent. These exposures include, {{but are not limited}} to, medication or drug exposures, maternal infections and diseases, and environmental and occupational exposures. Paternal smoking use has also been linked to an increased risk of birth defects and childhood cancer for the offspring, where the paternal germline undergoes oxidative damage due to cigarette use. Teratogen-caused birth defects are potentially preventable. Studies have shown that nearly 50% of pregnant women have been exposed to at least one medication during gestation. During pregnancy, a female can also be exposed to teratogens from the contaminated clothing or toxins within the <b>seminal</b> <b>fluid</b> of a partner. An additional study found that of 200 individuals referred for genetic counseling for a teratogenic exposure, 52% were exposed to more than one potential teratogen.|$|E
25|$|The female {{fruit fly}} prefers a shorter {{duration}} {{when it comes}} to sex. Males, on the other hand, prefer it to last longer. Males perform a sequence of five behavioral patterns to court females. First, males orient themselves while playing a courtship song by horizontally extending and vibrating their wings. Soon after, the male positions itself {{at the rear of the}} female's abdomen in a low posture to tap and lick the female genitalia. Finally, the male curls its abdomen and attempts copulation. Females can reject males by moving away, kicking, and extruding their ovipositor. Copulation lasts around 15–20 minutes, during which males transfer a few hundred, very long (1.76mm) sperm cells in <b>seminal</b> <b>fluid</b> to the female. Females store the sperm in a tubular receptacle and in two mushroom-shaped spermathecae; sperm from multiple matings compete for fertilization. A last male precedence is believed to exist: the last male to mate with a female sires about 80% of her offspring. This precedence was found to occur through both displacement and incapacitation. The displacement is attributed to sperm handling by the female fly as multiple matings are conducted and is most significant during the first 1–2 days after copulation. Displacement from the seminal receptacle is more significant than displacement from the spermathecae. Incapacitation of first male sperm by second male sperm becomes significant 2–7 days after copulation. The <b>seminal</b> <b>fluid</b> of the second male is believed to be responsible for this incapacitation mechanism (without removal of first male sperm) which takes effect before fertilization occurs. The delay in effectiveness of the incapacitation mechanism is believed to be a protective mechanism that prevents a male fly from incapacitating its own sperm should it mate with the same female fly repetitively. Sensory neurons in the uterus of female D. melanogaster respond to a male protein, sex peptide, which is found in sperm. This protein makes the female reluctant to copulate for about 10 days after insemination. The signal pathway leading to this change in behavior has been determined. The signal is sent to a brain region that is a homolog of the hypothalamus and the hypothalamus then controls sexual behavior and desire.|$|E
25|$|The {{prostate}} {{is a part}} of {{the male}} reproductive system that helps make and store <b>seminal</b> <b>fluid.</b> In adult men, a typical prostate is about 3 centimeters long and weighs about 20 grams. It is located in the pelvis, under the urinary bladder and in front of the rectum. The prostate surrounds part of the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder during urination and semen during ejaculation. Because of its location, prostate diseases often affect urination, ejaculation, and rarely defecation. The prostate contains many small glands which make about 20% of the fluid constituting semen. In prostate cancer, the cells of these prostate glands mutate into cancer cells. The prostate glands require male hormones, known as androgens, to work properly. Androgens include testosterone, which is made in the testes; dehydroepiandrosterone, made in the adrenal glands; and dihydrotestosterone, which is converted from testosterone within the prostate itself. Androgens are also responsible for secondary sex characteristics such as facial hair and increased muscle mass.|$|E
5000|$|To {{attract a}} female, the male will perform {{a variety of}} mating rituals such as [...] "preening, shaking, bill popping, head rubbing, and high flights. As with most birds, mating does not involve any {{coupling}} or insertion: instead, a transfer of <b>seminal</b> <b>fluids</b> occurs during external contact between the cloacal openings. After a gestation period of five to six days, the female lays a clutch of three to five smooth, matte eggs which typically incubate for 19-23 days. After a successful courtship, pairs remain faithful and cohabitant, sharing parental responsibilities for the young.|$|R

Ejaculated semen, <b>seminal</b> vesicle <b>fluid</b> and blood serum also served as antigen sources. Although each reproductive fluid contained some blood antigens, these antigens were most numerous in rete testis fluid. Certain antigens present in rete testis fluid, but not detectable in blood serum, were associated with testicular sperm; others, common to <b>seminal</b> vesicle <b>fluid,</b> may be secretory products or enzymes originating in the seminiferous tubules. Some antigens apparently are selectively resorbed, utilized, or altered within the epididymis since all nonblood antigens entering the epididymis in rete testis fluid were not detected in cauda epididymal plasma.
