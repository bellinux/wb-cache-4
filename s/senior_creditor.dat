40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{explanation}} {{for one of the}} most important and persis-tent puzzles in corporate reorganizations. In a Chapter 11 reorganization, <b>senior</b> <b>creditors</b> are, in principle, entitled to insist upon “absolute priority. ” They have a right to be paid in full before junior investors receive anything. In practice, how-ever, departures from absolute priority are commonplace. <b>Senior</b> <b>creditors</b> regu-larly allow those junior to them to participate even when they may not be paid in full. Explaining this gap between theory and practice has been a central preoccu-pation of reorganization scholars since the 1920 s. Conventional accounts point to the unwillingness of judges to fully recognize the rights of <b>senior</b> <b>creditors</b> and the ability of those junior to them to game the system to their advantage. In this paper, we suggest that these accounts are inadequate in the context of the reor-ganization of large businesses today. Something more is at work...|$|R

40|$|Where a <b>senior</b> <b>{{creditor}}</b> {{has access}} to two funds from the same debtor to satisfy its claims and the junior creditor {{has access to}} {{only one of these}} funds, it could be equitable to expect that the <b>senior</b> <b>creditor</b> satisfy itself out of the fund in which the junior creditor does not have an interest. Where a court makes an order based on this principle, it has invoked the doctrine of marshalling, sometimes called the two-fund rule. 2 ̆ 7 Marshalling is an equitable doctrine and therein lies its strengths and weaknesses. Equity gives it its flexibility, adaptibility and utility. Equity also gives it its uncertainty and lack of clear boundaries. Marshalling is used to prevent the arbitrary action of a <b>senior</b> <b>creditor</b> from destroying the rights or expectations of a junior creditor or a creditor with less security. It is used to lessen the chance that a junior creditor may lose its security solely at the whim of the <b>senior</b> <b>creditor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s choice of property to pursue. Marshalling is not based on the law of contracts or liens. It is founded instead in equity, being designed to promote fair dealing and justice. Equity has its limits. Use of the doctrine of marshalling is common in several different areas of the law. It is frequently used in the administration of estates to help determine the distribution of assets. This is usually called marshalling of assets and is to be distinguished from its use in settling priorities between successive encumbrancers, called marshalling of securities. 2 ̆...|$|E

A three period model is also developed to entertain the possibility that the sovereign engage in credit activities in subsequent periods, where in the final period the debtor has obligations towards junior and <b>senior</b> <b>creditors.</b> This allows for dynamic inconsistency, as the sovereign may be tempted to increase its debt in the second period, thus increasing the probability of repudiation in the third period.

40|$|Corporate {{reorganization}} under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code {{is built}} on {{the foundation of the}} absolute priority rule, which requires that <b>senior</b> <b>creditors</b> be paid in full before any value can be distributed to junior creditors. The standard law and economics understanding is that absolute priority follows inevitably from the 2 ̆ 2 creditors 2 ̆ 7 bargain 2 ̆ 2 model. That model tells us that the optimal system of reorganization must respect nonbankruptcy contract rights while maximizing the expected value of assets in bankruptcy. The conventional wisdom is that absolute priority fits this bill as the singular way of protecting creditors 2 ̆ 7 nonbankruptcy contract rights. But what if this conventional wisdom is incorrect? A closer look at the structure of corporate debt suggests that it is. Junior creditors issue debt supported by the residual value of the debtor firm. The repayment of that debt is contingent on the future value of the firm: the junior creditors receive any future value that exceeds the face value of the senior debt. It is well recognized that this right is the equivalent of a call option on the firm 2 ̆ 7 s assets. And yet Chapter 11 destroys the value of that call option by collapsing all future possibilities to present-day value. Thus, absolute priority eliminates the nonbankruptcy contract rights of junior creditors and creates new rights in going-concern value for <b>senior</b> <b>creditors.</b> This Article examines the potential of an alternative priority mechanism that protects both the junior creditors 2 ̆ 7 call-option value and the <b>senior</b> <b>creditors</b> 2 ̆ 7 nonbankruptcy contract rights.

In this paper, we explain these contradictive behaviors {{stem from the}} violation of the absolute priority rule (APR) among the stakeholders in Japan. Under the legal violation of priority rule, the borrowers with inefficient projects can finance from a new junior creditor, transferring the credit value of the <b>senior</b> <b>creditor</b> to the new junior one.

Anticipation of senior lending might make the country better off by preventing inefficient liquidation.

We estimate these losses to be up to 0. 28 percent of the going-concern value of the firm, on average, across all bankrupt firms in our sample. As predicted by theory, these losses primarily are realized by firms with asset values that are close to the face value of secured debt. Our estimate of efficiency losses is driven by several auxiliary findings, including estimates of the fraction of firms that are efficiently reorganized, the fraction of firms that are efficiently and inefficiently liquidated, and the average liquidation discount faced by firms in bankruptcy. ...|$|E

40|$|Subordination {{agreements}} among creditors {{are common}} in financial transactions. When a company seeks additional credit, the new lender may insist on an agreement with existing creditors which provides that their right to payment will be subordinated to the full payment of the new loan. The existing creditors {{may be willing to}} sign such an agreement for the purpose of encouraging the new lender to provide the borrower with liquidity needed to continue the business as a profitable venture, thereby increasing the likelihood that the borrower will meet all future financial obligations. In addition, contractual subordination is used frequently in connection with the issuance of debt securities. The level of priority of the debt securities, whether senior or junior, will directly affect their interest rate and market price. In general, contractual subordination will be respected in the event the borrower becomes a debtor in a bankruptcy case. Section 510 (a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that “[a] subordination agreement is enforceable in a case under this title to the same extent that such agreement is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law. ” Unless a bankruptcy court rearranges priorities based on equitable principles, known as equitable subordination, or the class of senior creditors effectively waives the benefits of the subordination agreement by voting to accept a chapter 11 plan in which they give up their rights to junior creditors, the subordination agreement controls the ranking of prebankruptcy claims against the bankruptcy estate. In addition to using subordination agreements to achieve priority over other creditors with respect to the payment of their claims, senior creditors also use them to obtain other rights from junior creditors. In particular, subordination agreements have included provisions that give the <b>senior</b> <b>creditor</b> the right to cast the junior creditor 2 ̆ 7 s vote to either accept or reject a plan of reorganization in the event the borrower is in chapter 11. These provisions effectively give a <b>senior</b> <b>creditor</b> two votes; it may vote with respect to its own claim and may vote again with respect to the subordinated claim. Senior creditors have argued that these provisions should be enforceable as a matter of contract, but junior creditors, wishing to vote on a chapter 11 plan despite the contractual provision, have argued that the enforcement of these provisions would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code granting voting rights only to the holders of claims. This article will examine how courts have dealt with these voting rights provisions found in subordination agreements...|$|E

Hence it is of utmost importance to study the mutual dependence of losses for different creditors in the case of large, overlapping credit portfolios. We analytically calculate the multivariate joint loss distribution of several credit portfolios on a non-stationary market. To take fluctuating asset correlations into account we use an random matrix approach which preserves, as a much appreciated side effect, analytical tractability and drastically reduces the number of parameters. We show that for two disjoint credit portfolios diversification does not work in a correlated market. Additionally we find large concurrent portfolio losses to be rather likely. We show that significant correlations of the losses emerge not only for large portfolios with thousands of credit contracts but also for small portfolios consisting of a few credit contracts only. Furthermore we include subordination levels, which were established in collateralized debt obligations to protect the more senior tranches from high losses. We analytically corroborate the observation that an extreme loss of the subordinated creditor is likely to also yield a large loss of the <b>senior</b> <b>creditor.</b> Comment: 25 pages, 10 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{ubiquity of}} bank {{seniority}} {{is now a}} widely accepted fact in the academic literature. At the same time, trade creditors are sometimes granted a purchase money security interest in the materials or equipment they provide the firm. These two conflicting facts present a puzzle: Why would banks willingly give up a valuable priority claim on the firm, but only {{with respect to a}} subset of the firm’s assets? We propose a resolution to this paradox of priority by arguing that trade creditors are better able to liquidate the materials they supply to a firm. When trade creditors have a security interest in these assets, their claims are state-contingent, and therefore dependent on the value of the assets pledged as collateral. Surprisingly, this ability of trade creditors to more efficiently liquidate the materials they supply to a firm also makes it desirable to subordinate the non-collateralized portion of their claims. Doing so increases the face value of a trade creditor’s claim for a given level of borrowing, thereby increasing the “liquidation bang ” from each trade credit buck. This combined priority structure maximizes social welfare by reducing the firm’s overall cost of funding. Banks are generally the most <b>senior</b> <b>creditor</b> among lenders to small business borrowers. Mann (1997) and Schwartz (1997) present evidence that banks not only take senior claims over other creditors, but also collateralize as much of their debt as possible and use loan covenants to limit th...|$|E

40|$|PROJECT FINANCING OF NATURAL GAS PIPELINES A STUDY ON NATURAL GAS PIPELINE PROJECT FINANCING UNDER FINANCIAL LAW AND LAW OF SECURITY INTERESTS. 1 Object {{and methods}} of the study Currently, Russia is the only {{supplier}} of natural gas to Finland. This study investigates how can the natural gas markets in Finland be opened by constructing a natural gas pipeline from Norway through Sweden to Finland {{in a manner that}} would be beneficial under financing laws and the law of security interests. Answers have been sought applying traditional analytical doctrine, utilizing as far as possible the questions enabled by the doctrine. In places where the answers have not been found applying traditional analytical doctrine, Juha Karhu s contemporary approach to the law of security interests has been applied. This study discusses various issues under financial law and law related to security interests related to property located in Finland, Sweden and Norway. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to examine whether a project company, as the borrower under a project loan, or the shareholders of a project company, could provide sufficient collateral for loan for a natural gas pipeline project. The legal literature used and discussed in this study includes a large variety of Nordic monographs and general property law books. In addition, Nordic case law concerning certain legal questions about which no literature is available has been studied in detail. 2 Structure of the study The study is divided into sections based on the type of collateral for the project loan. In addition, the study includes a short financing section in which the elements of a natural gas pipeline feasibility study are described, studied and applied to a hypothetical natural gas pipeline project. The discussion of the collateral for the project loan is divided into sections: (i) the property law-related issues concerning the construction of the pipeline and the possibility of pledging real estate owned, leased or expropriated by the project company as collateral for the project loan; (ii) the nature of the intercreditor agreements entered into among the members of the banking syndicate under Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian law; (iii) how the so-called earnings principle would affect the structure of the construction agreement for the natural gas pipeline and the effectiveness of the pledge of natural gas transportation fee receivables in the Nordic countries; (iv) how the pledgee could use the control factor related to a share pledge when the shareholders of the project company pledge the project company s shares as collateral for the project loan. 2. 1 Real property required to construct the natural gas pipeline Due to its length, the natural gas pipeline would be built on real property owned by other parties than the project company. The project company would receive the right to use this property through an expropriation procedure. One of the most valuable assets of the project company has is the turbines that are located at the compressor stations. In order to ensure that the natural gas flowing through the pipeline remains pressurized, it must periodically be compressed along the pipeline at the compressor stations. This section examines the land codes of Finland, Sweden and Norway and discusses the possibilities for the project company to delineate which machine or facility is, or is not, part of a real estate through registration. This registration has proven useful in determining the scope of the real estate mortgage vis-à-vis the scope of a business mortgage established to the project company s assets. The registration should be used to designate that the turbines, for example, are part of the project company s real estate, and therefore, pledged under the real estate mortgage. If this registration is not carried out, there is a risk that the turbines will be considered to be pledged as a part of the business mortgage established to the project company s assets. In Finland, a business mortgage lender may only recover 50 percent of the enforcement proceeds and the remainder is divided among all creditors. 2. 2 Intercreditor agreements t is customary for the members of the banking syndicate that finance a project loan to enter into an intercreditor agreement. This agreement regulates, among other things, the relationship between the senior and junior creditors regarding the terms of loan repayment and the payment order regarding the payment received from the enforcement of the project collateral. In Finland, the Act on Creditors Payment Order (1578 / 1992, as amended) regulates the payment order in a debtor s bankruptcy or foreclosure. Similar acts are in force in Sweden and Norway. However, it is possible for the parties to agree on an alternative payment order and these agreements are binding inter partes. In Finland, in order for the obligations of an intercreditor agreement to bind third parties, the agreement must be construed as a pledge or transfer of receivables with the intention of securing payment to the <b>senior</b> <b>creditor.</b> It may also be construed as a new financing form to which the Finnish Promissory Notes Act (487 / 1987, as amended) would be applied by analogy. 2. 3 The effects of the so-called earnings principle on the collateral securing the repayment of the project loan and on the construction agreement Due to the scale and complexity of natural gas pipeline projects, the construction of a natural gas pipelines usually takes years to complete. The so-called earnings principle affects the structure of the construction agreement. The question discussed in this section is whether it is advisable for the project company to allow the constructor to build the pipeline on its own account or whether the project company would benefit from an agreement under which the pipeline would be constructed in parts and the ownership of individual segments of the pipeline would be transferred to the project company upon their completion. If the constructor files for bankruptcy, this above-mentioned framework could serve as a basis for concluding which parts of the unfinished pipeline would be part of the project company s or the constructor s bankruptcy estate and which part will be covered by a business mortgage established to the project company s or the construction company s assets. In addition, the earnings principle affects the effectiveness of the pledge of natural gas transportation fee receivables in the Nordic countries. If the pledged receivable is not divisible, and the pledgor was unable to earn the receivable before the pledgor s bankruptcy, the pledgor s bankruptcy estate has the right to terminate the underlying pledge agreement, rendering the pledge null and void. If the bankruptcy estate continues the pledgor s business, it is entitled to the pledged assets because no part of the pledge was earned by the pledgor prior to its bankruptcy. If (a) the pledged agreement is divisible, (b) the estate continues the pledgor s business and (c) the estate is unable to terminate the portions of the pledge already earned, the earnings principle divides the pledge into two parts: the pledgee will receive the part of the pledge earned prior to the bankruptcy and the bankruptcy estate is entitled to the part earned after bankruptcy. This study raises arguments against the contemporary view accepted in legal literature in relation to the pledging of future receivables. The contemporary view is to consider that the earnings principle is taken into account when the pledge is established. The view presented in this study is that the earnings principle does not come into effect prior to the execution phase of the pledge agreement. 2. 4 Pledging of the project company s shares The shareholders of a project company usually pledge the project company s shares as collateral for the project loan. The study analyses in detail the problems related to the control function and the collateral function of a share pledge. The control function related to a share pledge affects the possession of the shares from the establishment of the share pledge to the enforcement of the pledge. The thorough examination of the parties risk positions serves as an interesting starting point. The section discusses how the composition of a project company s board of directors may affect the decisions the project company makes and the claw back of the company s pledge/mortgage agreements to the project company s bankruptcy estate. There are jurisdictions in which a project company s sponsors are unable to pledge the project company s shares to the banking syndicate as collateral for the project loan. In such jurisdictions, a floating charge as found in English law may prove a useful tool due to the fact that it covers all of a company s assets (including real property). In such cases, the floating charge would de facto have the same characteristics as a share pledge in terms of controlling the project. Tutkimuksesta yleensä Tutkimuksessa on pyritty hakemaan vastausta siiten, miten Suomeen voitaisiin luoda maakaasumarkkinat rahoitus- ja vakuusoikeudellisesti kannattavalla tavalla rakentamalla putki Norjasta Ruotsin läpi Suomeen. Tarkastelun kohteena ovat erityisesti projektiyhtiön maakaasuputken ja kompressoriasemien rakentamista varten ottaman projektilainan vakuudet ja pankkikonsortion vakuusoikeudellinen asema. Tämä pääkysymys huomioiden tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan, miten rahoitus- ja vakuusoikeuden yleisiä oppeja ja sen mahdollistamia oikeudellisia instrumentteja voitaisiin hyödyntää siten, että projektin rahoittava pankkikonsortio saisi lainalleen kattavat vakuudet. Maakaasuputken vaatimat kiinteisöt Tutkimuksen viitekehys muodostuu kiinteistöjen osalta tarkasteltavien maiden kiinteistöjärjestelmien erojen ja yhtäläisyyksien sekä kiinteistön ulottuvuuden selvittämisestä. Kiinteistön ulottuvuudella on merkitystä sen suhteen, mitä omaisuutta kuuluu kiinteistö- tai laitoskiinnityksen piiriin ja mikä osuus on vakuutena yhtiön varoihin vahvistetun yrityskiinnityksen nojalla. Maakaasuputken rahoittajien asema Maakaasuputken rakentaminen toteutetaan projektilainalla/(-lainoilla), jonka myöntää yleensä pankkikonsortio. Senioriluotonantaja, jonka saatavalle junioriluotonantajan saatava on alistettu, on kohdeyhtiön varoja jaettaessa maksunsaantijärjestyksessä muita rahoittajia edellä, joten huonommassa asemassa olevien juniorilainojen pääoma ja korot voidaan maksaa pääsääntöisesti silloin, kun senioriluoton pääoma ja korot on maksettu. Mezzanine-instrumentit ovat sopimuksellisesti tai rakenteellisesti alisteisia suhteessa seniorilainoihin. Mezzanine-velkojat luetaan junioriluotonantajiin. Ne tulevat velkojien keskenään sopimassa maksunsaantijärjestyksessä senioriluotonantajien jälkeen, mutta ennen muita junioriluotonantajia. Tutkimuksessa tullaan perustellusti siihen tulokseen, että tarkoituksenmukaisinta olisi mieltää velkojien välinen alistamissopimus saatavan panttaukseksi tai siirroksi (vaikka sitä kansainvälisessä luotonannossa ei näin jäsennetäkään), taikka vaihtoehtoisesti omaksi vakuusmuodokseen, johon voitaisiin analogisesti soveltaa velkakirjalain määräyksiä. Urakkasopimuksen rakenteen vaikutus ansaintaperiaatteen soveltuvuuteen sekä ansaintaperiaatteen soveltuvuus maakaasuputken tuottaman kassavirran panttaukseen Ansaintaperiaatteella tarkoitetaan panttioikeudellisessa mielessä, ettei saamista koskeva panttaus sido pantinantajan ulosmittausvelkojia ja konkurssivelkojia, ennen kuin pantatun saamisen perusteena olevan pantinantajan suoritusvelvollisuus on täytetty. Ansaintaperiaatteen vaikutusta projektirahoituksessa tarkastellaan tässä tutkimuksessa silmällä pitäen urakoitsijan mahdollisia taloudellisia vaikeuksia ja näiden vaikutusta projektilainan vakuuksiin. Sillä, toimiiko urakoitsija rakennuttajana omaan lukuunsa niin, että maakaasuputken ja kompressoriasemien omistusoikeus luovutetaan projektiyhtiölle vasta niiden valmistuttua vai rakennetaanko putki suoraan projektiyhtiön lukuun niin, että omistusoikeus maakaasuputkeen ja kompressoriasemiin siirtyy sitä mukaa kuin ne valmistuvat, on ratkaiseva merkitys. Ansaintaperiaatetta on perinteisesti tutkittu ja oikeuskäytännössä sovellettu kassavirran panttaamisen yhteydessä. Maakaasun siirtomaksuista kertyvä kassavirta on projektiyhtiön tärkein omaisuuserä. Maakaasua siirtävän projektiyhtiön kassavirran panttaamiseen ansaintaperiaate soveltuu hyvin alalla noudatetun käytännön vuoksi. Tässä tutkimuksessa ansaintaperiaatteen sovellettavuutta tutkitaan kuitenkin myös rakennutettavien esineiden omistusoikeuden siirtymisen kohdalla. Projektiyhtiön pankkitilien panttaus Pankkitilien panttausta koskeva sääntely on tässä tutkimuksessa soveltuvilta osiltaan Pohjoismaissa hyvin samankaltaista. Sillä sijaitsevatko projektiyhtiön pankkitilit pankkikonsortiopankeissa vai jossain näiden ulkopuolisissa pankeissa on kuitenkin merkitystä Ruotsissa. Ruotsin konkurssilaissa ei nimittäin ole erityistä kieltoa pankille kuitata saatavansa pankkitilillä olevia saatavia vastaan, vaikka kuittaus konkurssin ulkopuolella olisikin sopimuksen nojalla kielletty. Ruotsissa tilipankissa olevien varojen on katsottu olevan pankin omaisuutta ja sen käytettävissä kuittaukseen panttauksesta huolimatta. Velkoja voi kuitata velallisen konkurssissa sekä siinä tapauksessa, että hänen oma velkansa on erääntymätön tai ehdollinen että siinä tapauksessa, että velallisen velka on erääntymätön tai ehdollinen. Suomessa pankkien eriarvoisuudesta johtuvat ongelmat on huomioitu konkurssilaissa. Ongelma esiintyy ainoastaan tilanteessa, jossa projektilainanvakuudet täytyy jakaa pankkikonsortion jäsenten kesken. Käytännössä kuitenkin projektilainan vakuuksia hallinnoi aina vakuusagentti kaikkien pankkikonsortion jäsenten lukuun ja pankkikonsortion jäsenten kuittausoikeus on sopimusoikeudellisesti estetty velkojien välisen alistamissopimuksen (intercreditor agreement) kuittauskielloilla. Tutkimuksessa päädytään perustellusti siihen tulokseen, että vakuusagentin käyttö ja velkojien välisen alistamissopimuksen määräykset ovat välttämättömiä erityisesti Ruotsissa, jotta vältetään tilipankin kuittausoikeuden aiheuttama ongelma. Osakekantapantti ja kontrollifunktio Osakekantapantti on projektirahoituksessa takauslain mukainen vierasvelkapanttaus. Pankkikonsortio kontrolloi projektiyhtiön hallintoa tälle annetun valtakirjan ja hallituksen tarkkailijajäsenten avulla. Osakekantapanttiin liittyvä kontrollioikeuden käyttäminen ei merkitse ainoastaan vaikuttamista osakekantapantin kohteena olevaan yhtiöön, vaan kontrollioikeudella säädellään myös osakekantapantin realisointiajankohtaa. Mahdollinen maakaasuverkkoluvan panttaus Kansainvälisiä sijoittajia voisi houkutella sijoittamaan suomalaisiin/Pohjoismaalaisiin hankkeisiin mahdollistamalla maakaasuverkkoluvan vakuuskäytön. Esimerkkiä lupien vakuuskäytölle löytyy muun muassa kaivosluvan vakuuskäytöstä sekä Norjasta, missä putken operoimiseen ja rakentamiseen myönnettyä lupaa voidaan käyttää vakuutena operointia ja rakentamista varten otetulle lainalle. Maakaasuverkkoluvan panttaamisen mahdollistaminen ei aiheuttaisi suurta hallinnollista taakkaa maakaasumarkkinaviranomaisena toimivalle Energiamarkkinavirastolle sen vuoksi, ettei Suomeen tule useita maakaasuputkihankkeita. Kyse olisi todennäköisesti muutamasta luvasta. Maakaasuverkkoluvan panttaamisella olisi ehkä enemmänkin merkitystä maakaasuputkihankkeen vakuuskokonaisuuden kannalta. Olisi varmasti oikeuspoliittisesti tarkoituksenmukaista, mikäli maakaasuverkkoluvan vakuuskäyttö sallittaisiin, samassa yhteydessä muuttaa lakia/maanmittauslaitosten kirjaamisohjeita mahdollistaen pakkolunastetun käyttöoikeuden luokitteleminen rasitteeksi. Näiden kahden vakuusoikeuteen liittyvän muutoksen avulla pantin kohteena olisi projektiyhtiön harjoittama maakaasuverkkotoiminta sekä toiminnan edellyttämä kiinteistöomaisuus kokonaisuutena. ...|$|E

40|$|Under U. S. Bankruptcy Code, equity holders can restructure {{different}} debt {{classes at}} a time. Recognizing this {{allows us to}} endogenize, in continuous time, not only the restructuring threshold but also the restructuring order of senior and junior classes. Unlike previous studies, sequential restructuring explains absolute priority violation (APV) not just among debt and equity but also among debt classes. The extent of APV leads to positive credit spreads even if <b>senior</b> <b>creditors</b> are fully secured and virtually immune to default risk. Moreover, sequential restructuring can lead to reversals in the credit spreads. We provide sufficient conditions for avoiding reversals.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} the concern that a {{preference}} for quick sales over traditional reorganization cases - which we see in both the United States and Canada - might allow the debtor’s management to work with secured lenders to extract assets from the debtor {{in a way that would}} not be possible in a “normal” bankruptcy case. In particular, we examine how a quick sale can be used to cleanse assets of their association with environmental claims. We also consider how the insolvency systems in our respective countries might adapt to address this problem. Ultimately, the best protection for involuntary creditors, including environmental creditors, is to maximize the value of the debtor’s assets. That counsels for improving stakeholders’ ability to monitor the sale process and ensure that the sale process in not rushed for the sole benefit of <b>senior</b> <b>creditors...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of optimal capital {{structure}} {{based on the idea}} that debt and equity differ in their priority status relative to future corporate cash pants. A company with high (dispersed) debt will find it hard to raise new capital since new security-holders will have low priority relative to existing <b>senior</b> <b>creditors.</b> Conversely for a company with low debt. We show that there is an optimal debt-equity ratio and mix of senior and junior debt for a corporation whose management may undertake unprofitable as well as profitable investments. Among other things, our theory can explain the observation that profitable firms have low debt. In addition, it predicts that (long-term) debt will be high if new investment is risky and on average profitable, or if assets in place are risky an new investment is on average unprofitable. ...|$|R
50|$|General {{bankruptcy}} principles {{hold that}} executory contracts are avoidable in practice, because neither party has fulfilled {{its part of}} the bargain and thus breach by either party only gives rise to expectation damages. Damages awards after commencement of a bankruptcy filing results in claims that take after more <b>senior</b> <b>creditors.</b> They are relegated {{to the status of}} general creditors because while breach would occur after filing of the bankruptcy petition, the contract was entered into before the filing. If a creditor is a general unsecured creditor and there is not enough money, they usually are not paid; so as a matter of practical economics, if the downturn in a company's fortunes which resulted in bankruptcy makes the performance of an executory contract less valuable than its breach, the rational company would breach. There would be no negative monetary consequences of such breach because there would be no money left for the other contract party to take because in practice general unsecured creditors are left with nothing.|$|R

40|$|The Chapter 11 {{bankruptcy}} process {{demands a}} careful balance between protecting the creditors’ rights to be repaid and allowing a failing entity {{the ability to}} restructure. The Supreme Court in RadLAX Gateway Hotel affirmed the Seventh Circuit’s holding in River Road and interpreted the Bankruptcy Code {{in a way that}} improperly shifts this balance towards the most <b>senior</b> <b>creditors</b> at the expense of business. This Note will analyze the circuit disagreement over the cramdown provision in the Bankruptcy Code and the Supreme Court’s ultimate resolution. It will argue that in light of recent trends in the credit markets - including highly liquid secondary markets for debt and aggressive lenders looking to speculate on restructuring businesses - the Supreme Court’s current interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code supports improper policy. It will also argue that consistent interpretation between two provisions in the Bankruptcy Code §§ 363 and 1129 (b), focusing on balancing the needs of debtors to restructure with the rights of creditors to be repaid suggests that the Supreme Court should have interpreted the cramdown provision to grant more flexibility in plan design. This Note argues that Congress, in light of the RadLAX decision, should amend the Bankruptcy Code to better suit the goals of the modern-day bankruptcy...|$|R
40|$|The new value {{exception}} to the Chapter 11 absolute priority rule provides a narrow avenue for equity holders to retain an equity interest in a reorganized company {{over the objections of}} <b>senior</b> <b>creditors</b> and interest holders. With the increasing number of Chapter 11 reorganization filings by private equity owned companies, private equity firms may be interested in exploring ways to retain their equity ownership in the debtor company. This Note explores the unique implications a private equity firm may encounter when attempting to utilize the new value exception as a last resort to maintain ownership in a debtor company. Part II of this Note briefly explains how the absolute priority rule functions. Furthermore, this section discusses the case law development of the new value exception. Part III then analyzes the particular challenges and considerations a private equity firm may face when attempting to meet each of the new value exception requirements. Ultimately, this section demonstrates that private equity firms hold a unique position among debtor-reorganized companies, which may aid them in obtaining new equity ownership through the new value exception. Part IV therefore concludes that private equity firms may be {{able to take advantage of}} this exception, but they must tread cautiously in light of an absence of case law guidance and the ambiguous legislation surrounding the new value exception...|$|R
