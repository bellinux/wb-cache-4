5|$|The {{practice}} of allowing parents frequent visiting to hospitalised children became the norm {{and there was}} a move towards placing homeless children with foster carers, rather than in institutions, and a move towards the professionalisation of alternative carers. In hospitals, the change was given added impetus by the work of <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> <b>and</b> psychoanalyst James Robertson who filmed the distressing effects of separation on children in hospital and collaborated with Bowlby in making the 1952 documentary film A Two-Year Old Goes to the Hospital.|$|E

40|$|M. A. Both {{community}} development officers <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> {{are involved in}} the development of communities. Even though {{community development}} implies a strong concept of teamwork, the researcher observed lack of active participation by community development officers <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers.</b> Most of the time one group is not clear about what the other group is doing. The study was undertaken among <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> community development officers employed by the Department of Health and Welfare in the Northern Province, Southern Region. It was undertaken in order to describe and compare the role <b>and</b> functions of <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> community development officers in a community setting. The goal {{of the study was to}} develop a strategy for providing an integrated and coordinated service by the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> community development officers for the Department of Health and Welfare in the Northern Province.

A former Raëlian named Jean Parraga believed that his wife and children were being held as prisoners and that Raël attempted to break up his family. He thought they were being treated like criminals in activities such as orgies and sacrifice involving children at the Sensual Meditation camp.

5|$|On 5 August 1999, a Haringey social worker, Barry Almeida, took Climbié to an NSPCC centre in Tottenham, {{where she}} was {{assigned}} to Sylvia Henry. There was some confusion {{as to why the}} centre was being referred to for the case. Henry later contacted Almeida and was told, according to Henry, that Climbié had moved out of the borough, thereby closing the case. Almeida said he could not remember whether this conversation did take place. On the same day, Kouao met Arthurworrey and Jones at the Haringey social services department, and claimed that Climbié had poured boiling water over herself to stop the itching caused by the scabies and that she had used utensils to cause the other injuries. The <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> <b>and</b> police officer believed her, deciding that the injuries were probably accidental, and allowed Climbié to return home the following day, which she did.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} these suspicions, many African-American leaders {{supported}} efforts to supply birth control to the African-American community. In 1929, James H. Hubert, a black <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> <b>and</b> leader of New York's Urban League, asked Sanger to open a clinic in Harlem.Engelman, p. 160. Sanger secured funding from the Julius Rosenwald Fund and opened the clinic, staffed with African-American doctors, in 1930. The clinic was guided by a 15-member advisory board consisting of African-American doctors, nurses, clergy, journalists, and social workers. It was publicized in the African-American press and African-American churches, and received the approval of W. E. B. Du Bois, co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In the early 1940s, the Birth Control Federation of America (BCFA) initiated a program called the Negro Project, managed by its Division of Negro Service (DNS).Engelman, pp. 175–177. As with the Harlem clinic, the primary aim of the DNS and its programs was to improve maternal and infant health. Based on her work at the Harlem clinic, Sanger suggested to the DNS that African Americans {{were more likely to}} take advice from a doctor of their own race, but other leaders prevailed and insisted that whites be employed in the outreach efforts. The discriminatory actions and statements by the movement's leaders during the 1920s and 1930s have led to continuing allegations that the movement was racist.Allegations of racism can be found in Franks, Angela (2005), Margaret Sanger's Eugenic Legacy: The Control of Female Fertility, McFarland; and in Davis, Angela (1981), Women, Race, and Class.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore Connecticut {{professional}} <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> 2 ̆ 7 (i. e., Clinical <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>and</b> School <b>Social</b> <b>Workers)</b> <b>and</b> Counselors 2 ̆ 7 (i. e., Mental Health Counselors and School Counselors) attitudes toward persons with the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). ^ AIDS presents a challenge to both <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>and</b> Counselors, not only in terms of what can be done on behalf of clients, but also how to respond professionally (Wexler, 1989). Therefore, this study utilized a quantitative research methodology (and the AIDS Attitude Scale) to investigate professional <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> 2 ̆ 7 and Counselors 2 ̆ 7 self-report measures of their empathy and avoidance attitudes toward persons with AIDS. ^ One hundred and twenty (120) study participants were randomly selected from the membership list of each of these professional associations, i. e., thirty participants selected from each of the four professional associations (N = 120). Each participant (Clinical <b>Social</b> <b>Workers,</b> School <b>Social</b> <b>Workers,</b> Mental Health Counselors, and School Counselors) was mailed a copy of the AIDS Attitude Scale, a consent to participate letter, and a stamped self-addressed envelope. ^ There was a statistically significant difference among Mental Health Counselors, Clinical <b>Social</b> <b>Workers,</b> School Counselors, <b>and</b> School <b>Social</b> <b>Workers,</b> as measured by the Empathy sub-scale of the AIDS Attitude Scale (AAS). The results from the ANOVA and Tukey HSD Post Hoc Test determined that the statistically significant difference was between Clinical <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>and</b> School Counselors with regard to the variable empathy (F [3, 89] = 2. 583, p 3 ̆c. 05). Hence, Clinical <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> had statistically significant higher empathy scores. ^ ANOVA procedures indicated statistical significance for the dependent variables as follows: (1) “Years experience in profession” between School <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>and</b> Mental Health Counselors (F [3, 89] = 3. 307, p 3 ̆c. 05). School <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> had statistically significant higher years of experience in the profession, and (2) “Know someone with AIDS” between Clinical <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>and</b> School Counselors (F [3, 82] = 4. 245, p 3 ̆c. 05). Hence, Clinical <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> had statistical significance with regard to knowing more people with AIDS. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} project aims {{to explore the}} perceptions of professional service needs from county <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> parents seeking reunification at Walden Family Services in San Bernardino. This research study gathers the professional perspective and personal opinions of <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> that work closely with parents who are attempting to reunify with their children and the perspective of parents going {{through the process of}} attempting to reunify. This {{research project}} explores the positive and negative themes that were found from the feedback given from <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> parents. The following study provides important insight into areas that can be improved from <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> parents working together. The findings can help <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> understand the perspectives of parents going through the reunification process and provide insight into the barriers that might be hindering them from being successful. The findings can be of assistance to <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> working with parents in the social welfare system as they may assist in prioritizing attention to drop-out rates of services, poverty, social work expectation towards parents and the quality of <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> in general. Vise-versa, these findings can be a help to parents understand the viewpoints of <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> their expectations <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> have on them. Ultimately, the research aims to provide insights on barriers that are impeding <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> parents from working together effectively and working as a team.

This qualitative study utilizes face to face interviews with open-ended questions as the tool to collect data from participants.
