5000|$|In Case E-4/04 Pedicel, the Court {{found that}} the rules on product {{coverage}} <b>of</b> the <b>EEA</b> <b>Agreement</b> mean that its general scope differs from the EU Treaties with regard to agricultural products. In particular, wine does not fall under the EEA provisions on free movement of goods. Further, the Court held that advertisement of wine, closely linked to trade in wine, is not covered by Article 36 EEA on the freedom to provide services, since advertising primarily fulfils the purpose of promoting the sale of wine. The prohibition on advertising of alcoholic beverages also relates to beer and spirits, products generally falling within the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>EEA</b> <b>Agreement.</b> The so-called precautionary principle, {{as defined by the}} EFTA Court in Kellogg’s, does not apply in a situation where there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of advertising.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This thesis {{sets out}} to assess whether the EU’s {{proposed}} new Governance regulation under the Energy Union is “EEA relevant”, meaning within or outside the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the European Economic Area (<b>EEA)</b> <b>Agreement.</b> Based on {{a review of the}} proposal, wider EU policy, the foundation for energy and climate cooperation, and a relevance assessment based on geographical and substantive criteria, the thesis finds that the governance regulation is EEA relevant. The thesis also places this case within a wider debate about the expanding <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>EEA</b> <b>Agreement.</b> While the agreement has remained unchanged since its signing 25 years ago, treaty changes and increased integration on the EU side have eroded the borders between internal market legislation and cooperation in other fields – complicating determinations <b>of</b> <b>EEA</b> relevance and stretching the intended legal limits for political and economic reasons. Note that the Governance regulation is currently being processed by the European Parliament and the European Council and may be subject to changes in the legislative process...|$|R

Þá er sjónum beint sérstaklega að tveimur ákvæðum íslenskra skattalaga með hliðsjón af ofangreindum reglum. Annars vegar ákvæðum tekjuskattslaganna sem lúta að arðgreiðslum milli félaga og hins vegar ákvæði laganna um heimild til samsköttunar móður- og dótturfélaga.

Ennfremur eru leiddar líkur að því að fleiri ákvæði íslenskra skattalaga séu sama marki brennd og jafnframt bent á að þróun Evrópuréttar, sem óhjákvæmilega mun hafa áhrif á túlkun EES-samningsins, bendir til þess að æ ríkari kröfur séu gerðar til hlutleysis skattareglna gagnvart þjóðerni og staðsetningu aðila. The EEA Agreement´s {{impact on}} tax law {{was not given}} much {{attention}} {{at the time of}} its ratification and only few cases regarding tax law had been brought to the ECJ by that time. In the first cases for the EFTA Court regarding direct taxation, it was argued that the tax regime was out <b>of</b> the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>EEA</b> <b>Agreement</b> and thus the general provisions of the Agreement were not applicable in that area. These and similar arguments have now been rejected clearly and repeatedly both by the EFTA court and by European Court of Justice. Discrimination based on nationality and any restriction regarding the use of the fundamental freedoms is prohibited unless it can be justified by overriding public interest. The subject of this article is to examine how these fundamental principles of he EU/EEA law affect direct taxation. The first part deals with general question as regards the <b>EEA</b> <b>agreement</b> as a source of law and the interplay between the Agreement and other national legislation. The second part, gives an overview over the interpretation of the above mentioned principles in the field of tax law with reference to relevant court cases by the ECJ and the EFTA court. Third part of the article takes further look at particular provisions of the Icelandic tax law. First provision relating to tax on dividends paid to companies and second, provisions regarding a group relief for corporation tax. It is concluded that in both cases there can be constituted a discrimination and restriction contrary to the <b>EEA</b> <b>agreement</b> and it is found unlikely, in the light of established case law, that these obstacles can be justified by reasons referring to overriding public interest. It is further indicated that other provisions of Icelandic tax law might also be contrary to the <b>EEA</b> <b>Agreement</b> and pointed out that the evolution of EU/EEA law is directed towards rigorous requirements of non-discriminating tax law...|$|R

Since the Icelandic deposit-guarantee scheme did not cover this sum, ESA claims that Iceland breached the Directive, specifically articles 3, 4, 7 and 10.

The EFTA Court held that provisions <b>of</b> the <b>EEA</b> <b>Agreement</b> as well as procedural provisions of the SCA are to be interpreted in the light of fundamental rights and that the provisions of the European Convention of Human Rights and the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights are important sources for determining the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> these rights. With regard to the right to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time granted by Article 6(1) ECHR, the EFTA Court observed that the European Court of Human Rights held in a case concerning a delay of two years and seven months due to a reference by a national court to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling, that this period of time could not be taken into consideration in the assessment of the length of a particular set of proceedings. To take it into account would adversely affect the system instituted by what is now Article 267 TFEU and work against the aim pursued in substance in that Article, as seen in Case Pafitis.

The article shows that Norway has adapted fully on areas covered by formal EEA obligations. However, Norway has gone even further in its adaptations to the EU. These “voluntary” adaptations can partly be explained by an economic logic where issue-linkages and domestic economic interests are at play, and partly by the authorities’ perceived constraints and obligations to cooperate with the EU in trade liberalization.
