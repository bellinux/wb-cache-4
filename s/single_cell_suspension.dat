40|$|The {{distinction}} between metastatic amelanotic melanoma and a poorly differentiated carcinoma is often difficult. With {{the use of}} the ultrastructural L-DOPA reaction as a tool for measuring tyrosinase activity within vesicular and cisternal organelles, cells containing melanin can be identified. Our study identified a tumor which was classified by light microscopy as an undifferentiated carcinoma and by electron microscopy as an undifferentiated neoplasm. Nine parameters were evaluated: a nude mouse xenograft, the patient's tumor cells in agar with and without L-DOPA treatment, and <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions</b> of the patient's tumor cells with and without L-DOPA treatment. As controls, cells from Cloudman S 91 (CCL) 53. 1 melanoma, grown into colonies in agar with and without L-DOPA treatment and in <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions</b> with and without L-DOPA treatment, were evaluated. The xenograft demonstrates no melanosomes. <b>Cells</b> in <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions</b> with L-DOPA treatment and patient cells grown into colonies in agar with and without L-DOPA treatment contain granular dense bodies within the cytoplasm, suggestive of melanosomes. Premelanosomes (Stage II), Golgi, and Golgi-associated smooth endoplasmic reticulum contain DOPA-positive reaction product when cultured in the agar assay. A DOPA-positive reaction is also noted in the Golgi-associated smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions.</b> The CCL line demonstrates premelanosomes in all cases. These. findings unequivocally identify the tumor as amelanotic melanoma and indicate that identification of DOPA-positive cells grown into colonies in agar are essential for diagnosis.

50|$|The {{quantitative}} lineage-tracing {{strategies have}} proven to be successful in resolving cell fates in normal epithelial tissues either using tissue -specific or stem-cell-specific transgenes. To conduct an inducible lineage-tracing experiment two components must be engineered into the mouse genome: a switch and a reporter. The switch is commonly a drug-regulated form of the bacterial enzyme Cre-recombinase. This enzyme recognizes specific sequences, called LoxP sites. Proteins that are capable of enhancing the identification of labeled cells or a specific population in unlabelled cells are encoded by the reporter transgenes.

For comparison, similar tests were performed using BRIN-BD 11 <b>cells</b> present in <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions</b> or allowed to form pseudoislets.

Insulin concentration in the culture medium reached a peak of 26 +/- 2. 0 ng/ml and 24 +/- 2. 2 ng/ml for cells grown on cytodex- 1 and cultispher-G, respectively. Cells grown on both types of microcarrier showed a significant 1. 5 - 1. 8 -fold acute insulin-secretory response to 16. 7 mmol/l glucose.

40|$|Transplantation of {{autologous}} cultured keratinocytes in <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>suspension</b> {{is useful}} {{in the treatment of}} burns. The reduced time needed for culture, and the fact that keratinocytes in suspension can be transported from the laboratory to the patient in small vials, thus reducing the costs involved and be stored (frozen) in the clinic for transplantation when the wound surfaces are ready, makes it appealing. We found few published data in the literature about actual cell survival after transplantation of keratinocytes in <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>suspension</b> and so did a comparative in vitro study, considering commonly used application techniques. Human primary keratinocytes were transplanted in vitro in a standard manner using different techniques. Keratinocytes were counted before and after transplantation, were subsequently allowed to proliferate, and counted again on days 4, 8, and 14 by vital staining. Cell survival varied, ranging from 47 % to > 90 %, depending on the technique. However, the proliferation assays showed that the differences in numbers diminished after 8 days of culture. Our findings indicate that a great number of cells die during transplantation but that this effect is diminished if cells are allowed to proliferate in an optimal milieu.
