50|$|The fuselage, a {{two step}} hull design, is a {{fibreglass}} structure on all models with the glazed cabin {{well below the}} wing underside. The two seat Che-24 and Che-26 have the same length, side by side seats and upward opening doors. The Che-29 is 400 mm longer and has a second pair of seats behind the first. Fixed wing tip floats, each mounted on parallel pairs of struts, provide <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> <b>water</b> where a water rudder under the fin is used for manoeuvring. All types {{have the option of}} an amphibious conventional undercarriage; the small mainwheels are on short cantilever legs which can be rotated upwards out of the water.|$|E
5000|$|Not {{long after}} {{building}} the Scheldemusch prototype, de Schelde also {{brought out a}} flying boat version called the Scheldemeeuw (meeuw = gull). Wings, empennage {{and much of the}} rest of the aircraft was the same as the Scheldemusch. [...] The fuselage was necessarily different, with the nacelle replaced with a wooden structured and plywood-skinned, single-step hull which extended rearwards almost to the tail. The longer fuselage made the attachment of the tail rather easier, three steel wires replacing the lower triplet of booms. The engine mounting and pilot's cockpit were little changed, though the flexible glazing was replaced with flat upright and more robust glass panels There were small floats fixed directly onto the underside of the lower wings for <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> <b>water.</b> Performance was similar to that of the Scheldemusch.|$|E
50|$|The Akoya's {{fuselage}} {{is pointed}} at the nose and almost circular at its greatest diameter. In elevation it has a curved underside and, above, the large one piece canopy over the side-by-side, dual control cabin forms an unbroken line with the fuselage. There is an electrically operated retractable undercarriage of the taildragger variety, with the main gear legs rotating backward and inwards into the fuselage, and the tailwheel arm rotating forward. All wheels have hydraulic brakes. Operation from water, without a planing bottom or floats, is performed undercarriage up on the round fuselage underside {{with the aid of}} a pair of fixed hydrofoils, called shark-fins, sharply tapered planes set at about 50° to the vertical just outboard of the mainwheels. Small tip floats are an option for better lateral <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> <b>water.</b> The Akoya, it is claimed by the manufacturer, can also land on snow, though skis are an option.|$|E
50|$|Although the U.S. Navy ordered four XLRQ-1 prototypes, {{only two}} were built (BuNos 11561 and 11562). The glider had a {{retractable}} landing gear and the wing roots provided lateral <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lateral <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> was {{provided}} by two wing-mounted floats, with single step, V-form undersides. These were mounted below the central-outer wing panel junctions at only about one-quarter span {{on a combination of}} faired-in vertical and inward leaning struts.|$|R
5000|$|The Impulse {{has much}} harder chines than the Laser, {{which gives the}} Impulse a gently V keeled and flatter wetted surface than the rounded Laser hull. This hull shape gives the Impulse more heeling <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> than the Laser making it more stable in rough and windy conditions.|$|R
50|$|A large float mounted {{under each}} wing {{maintained}} <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> <b>water.</b> With no wind, the float on the heavier side {{was always in}} the water; with some wind, the aircraft could be held using the ailerons with both floats out of the water. In the event of a float being broken off for some reason, as the craft lost airspeed after landing crew members would go out onto the opposite wing, to keep the remaining float in the water until the aircraft could reach its mooring. Marine growths on the hull were a problem; the resulting drag could be enough to prevent a fully loaded aircraft from gaining enough speed to become airborne. The aircraft could be taken to a freshwater mooring for sufficient time to kill off the fauna and flora growing on the bottom, which would then be washed away during takeoff runs. The alternative was to scrub it off, either in the water or on land.|$|E
50|$|It {{was a large}} biplane, with unequal span {{wings of}} high aspect ratio for the day. In plan the wings, mounted with very slight stagger, were {{rectangular}} out to straight angled tips. There were three parts, a central section attached to the upper hull which contained the engines and had no dihedral and outer sections with about 2° of dihedral. Each outer section was divided into two bays with three vertical pairs of interplane struts, the innermost at the junction with the central section. Outboard, the overhangs of the upper wing were supported by outward leaning pairs of struts from {{the feet of the}} outer interplane pairs; below these points flat-bottomed floats which provided lateral <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> <b>water</b> were mounted on short struts. The upper centre section was supported over the fuselage with a pair of transverse pair of inverted V -struts. Balanced, short span, broad chord ailerons were mounted at the tips of the upper wing only.|$|E
50|$|The Latham Trimotor (its Latham {{type number}} is not known) {{was a large}} biplane, with unequal span, blunted rectanglar plan wings with high aspect ratio for the time. The wings were built around a pair of spars {{constructed}} from spruce and poplar plywood. They were fabric covered and in three parts, a central section attached to the upper hull and two outer sections divided into two bays with three vertical pairs of parallel interplane struts, the innermost at the junction with the central section. The upper wing centre section was supported over the fuselage by a transverse inverted V-strut to the forward longeron and by two vertical struts to the rear longeron. Outboard, the overhangs of the upper wing were supported by outward leaning pairs of struts from {{the feet of the}} outer interplane pairs; below these points small, flat bottomed floats which provided lateral <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> <b>water</b> were mounted. Its ailerons were balanced and mounted only on the upper wing; they were short, reaching outwards from the outer interplane struts.|$|E
50|$|After testing as a landplane at Brooklands in May/June 1911, the Water Bird {{was brought}} to Hill of Oaks on Windermere and the float fitted {{in place of the}} wheeled undercarriage. A pair of {{cylindrical}} floats was mounted below the wingtips for lateral <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water.</b> The successful first flight was on 25 November 1911, with ex-Avro school pilot H. Stanley Adams.|$|R
50|$|As {{problems}} with <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> while taxiing, and with {{maintenance of the}} engine were never really resolved, that in practice, the Be-2 was restricted to training and secondary roles, and was more often deployed from land than from warships as originally planned. In addition, delays with updating the Navy's cruisers meant that suitable catapults were not installed until about 1939.|$|R
50|$|Conceptually, the Do E {{was very}} similar to the {{successful}} Dornier Wal, but smaller and single-engined. It was of all-metal construction, with a parasol wing that was attached by struts to a wide, shallow hull. The hull had a single step and <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> was ensured by the characteristic Dornier sponsons. The single engine was installed on top of the wing centre section, driving a tractor propeller.|$|R
50|$|The LeO H-23-2 had {{a wooden}} framed hull covered in birch plywood. Its planing bottom had a convex V-section quite {{different}} from the softly curved underside of the LeO H-23. There were two steps, one under the wings and the other at about two-thirds of the way back from the reinforced nose. Single-stepped floats, each mounted on two pairs of short struts from the tips of the lower wings ensured lateral <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> <b>water.</b> In the nose was an open position from which a crew member could take observations or bearings, assist with mooring or, in event of attack, uses a pair of machine guns on a flexible mounting. He could also release four bombs, held under the lower wings. Immediately behind this position was the pilots' open cockpit, which had side-by-side seats equipped with dual controls. Their seats were well separated to allow access to the front post via a door and had their own fuselage openings, windscreens and headrests. Passage rearwards between the seats led to a large cabin with windows for observation, containing radio equipment, a mapping table and a camera mounted for vertical or oblique photographs. Behind that was a dorsal gun position with another pair of flexibly mounted machine guns.|$|E
40|$|Langmuir - Blodgett {{technique}} and Atomic Force Microscopy {{were used to}} study the phase behaviour of organic molecules (fatty alcohols and monoacid saturated triglycerides) at air-water and air-solid interfaces. The structure of binary mixed LB monolayers of fatty alcohols was reported. The dependence of phase separation phenomena on {{the difference between the}} chain lengths of the two components and the surface pressure was described. Phase separation occurs in compressed films, if the chain length of the two components differed at least with six carbon atoms. A strong dependence of the domain shape on the surface pressure was observed. At high surface pressure, the domains get tetragonal shapes. In line with thermodynamic expectation, the tendency of phase separation increased with increasing the excess Gibbs energy. Triglycerides are typical example for materials, which surface structure is different from the bulk structure, thus leading to different macroscopic properties as would be expected from the bulk structure. They adopt a chair conformation in crystals, but at air-water interface they rearrange in trident conformation (all hydrocarbon chains pointing toward the same direction). Because of the trident conformation they behave as amphiphilic molecules at the air-water interface, though in general they are lipophilic. By definition a Langmuir monolayer is thermodynamically stable if during long time presence at air-water interface it does not change its structure. Conditions for stability against collapse can in principle be established by measuring the equilibrium spreading pressure and corresponding surface area of the material. One of the surprising results, described in this work, is that the triglycerides showed thermodynamic instability at air-water interface at surface pressures far below the collapse pressure. Under isobaric conditions a molecular rearrangement process takes place which effectively thickens the film. Using Atomic Force Microscopy we have shown that this process involves the growth of 3 D crystals of triglycerides on top of the monolayer for surface pressures above equilibrium spreading pressure. A new model to quantitatively describe this process was presented. The influence of the chain length of the triglyceride molecules on their <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> <b>water</b> and mica surfaces was described. The trident Langmuir - Blodgett monolayer is the less mobile and the crystal phase is more stable the longer the alkyl chains were. The nucleation rate increased with increasing the surface pressure at which the monolayer was compressed. The phase behaviour of binary mixed LB - monolayers of triglycerides was investigated. The relation between the phase separation and the chain length was shown. An incomplete phase separation was observed for the systems with two or more carbon atoms difference in the chain length of the two components. The solubility of the shorter PPP molecules in the "long" (SSS-rich and AAA-rich) phase was significant. In the mixture SSS-AAA, where the difference in the chain length is two carbon atoms as for PPP-SSS, phase separation was not observed. The conclusion was that, due to the stronger interaction between the longer alkyl chains, the sensibility for differences in the chain length decreases...|$|E
2500|$|The Latécoère 340 (sometimes written 34-0) was a three-engined {{flying boat}} {{designed}} to serve medium-range routes, {{such as those}} across the Mediterranean from France to her African colonies. [...] In general appearance it {{was similar to the}} Latécoère 21, with a parasol wing bearing two tractor and one central pusher engines, and used sponsons both for <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> and extra lift in the air. [...] It was smaller than the Latécoère 21, carrying only five passengers.|$|R
30|$|The main {{features}} that {{we tried to}} keep with the robotic device is the low Reynolds number assumption (met by using a special oil), {{as well as the}} one regarding the slim legs to minimize fluid interaction between them. The primary difficulty is to prevent the electronic to get in contact with the oil as it would get damaged permanently. For this reason, and after several trials and iterations, the model has been designed to accommodate a horizontal rail crossing through the body to guarantee its <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} a combination of metal tubing, with its flying surfaces covered in Dacron sailcloth doped aircraft fabric and a reinforced fiberglass hull. Its 30.83 ft span wing has a wing area of 150.0 sq ft and is supported by a central pylon behind the cockpit, [...] "V" [...] struts and jury struts. The wing also mounts outrigger pontoons that provide <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water.</b> The acceptable power range is [...] and the standard engine used is the [...] Rotax 447 twin cylinder, two stroke powerplant.|$|R
50|$|Its hull was wooden, with a concave section, {{single step}} bottom, gently curved sides and a flat top. The {{underside}} was triple surfaced and the sides double. <b>Stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> {{was provided by}} a pair of floats under the lower wings beneath the interplane strut mountings, separated by about 4.7 m. The hull contained three open crew positions. Two of them, one in the extreme nose and the other midway between the trailing edge and the tail, housed machine gunners. The cockpit, which was under {{the leading edge of the}} upper wing, had two side-by-side seats, equipped with dual controls.|$|R
2500|$|The hull, {{like the}} rest of the aircraft, was {{all-metal}} and rectangular, with flat sides and top. Its planing bottom was also flat, with two steps. <b>Stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> was provided by long, stepless floats on each side, strut-mounted from the wings a little outside the engines and braced to the fuselage with a parallel pair of horizontal struts. [...] The hull tapered in plan to the tail, where the empennage was again rectangular, with a broad fin reaching out beyond the end of the hull and carrying a balanced rudder. [...] The tailplane was mounted on the fin about one third of the way up, braced from below with a single strut on each side, and carried narrow-chord elevators.|$|R
25|$|Two prototypes of the AB-13, {{designated}} Experimental 10-Shi Observation Aircraft {{and with}} the short system designation F1A were built, the first a floatplane and the second with wheeled undercarriage, both being completed in 1936. Although Mitsubishi's competing F1M1 prototypes had poor <b>stability</b> both <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> and in the air, they had superior performance to Aichi's design. Mitsubishi redesigned its aircraft as the F1M2, eliminating its handling problems, and it was selected for production in 1940.|$|R
50|$|The earlier S.55 carried its {{empennage}} {{on a pair}} of open, flat, triangular girders {{constructed from}} tubes, one from each hull. The S.63 used a similar arrangement, allowing its single, unusually wide hull to be short. Its bottom had a shallow, concave V-section and a single step. Lateral <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> was provided by outward-leaning, V-bottomed floats mounted a little outside the centre-section. The original bomber version had derensive ring-mounted machine gun positions in the nose and behind the trailing edge. A forward entrance led to the pilots' side-by-side open cockpit, offset to the left and ahead of the wing leading edge. The airliner conversion separated the pilots into two symmetrically positioned, enclosed cockpits and introduced a windowed 3 × 3 m passenger cabin behind the cockpit which seated ten. Behind it there was a space for luggage and a wireless operator's compartment with access to the engines.|$|R
5000|$|A {{recreational}} kayak {{is a type}} of kayak that {{is designed}} for the casual paddler interested in recreational activities on a lake or flatwater stream; they presently make up the largest segment of kayak sales. Compared to other kayaks, recreational kayaks are characterized by having a larger cockpit opening for easy entry and exit and a wider beam (27 - 30 inches) for more <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> and are generally less than twelve feet in length, which makes them slower than a longer boat would be, but lighter, easier to handle {{in and out of the}} water, and less expensive. Due to the wider hull, recreational kayaks will not track (maintain a straight line) as well as longer, narrower models. They generally have limited cargo carrying capacity. Using less expensive materials like rotomolded polyethylene and including fewer options helps keep these boats inexpensive.|$|R
5000|$|The Che-25 is {{very similar}} in general {{appearance}} to earlier Boris Chernov designs such as the two seat Korvet and the Chernov Che-23 but is a four-seat aircraft and bigger in both length and span. It has an unswept, straight edged constant chord wing made from riveted duralumin, with a single spar. Lateral (roll) control is by full span flaperons and <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> is maintained by downturned fiberglass tips which act as simple floats. The parasol wing is braced by a single streamlined strut on each side to mid fuselage, assisted by jury struts, flying wires and a central section cabane. The twin engines are mounted above the wing leading edge. They can be either [...] Rotax 582 UL-2V air and water cooled, twin cylinder two strokes or [...] Rotax 912 ULS water cooled four stroke flat fours. The Rotax 582 is mounted uncowled and drives a two bladed propeller but the 912 installation is cowled with a three bladed propeller.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the start}} of the Second World War the Establishment was moved to the more secure and safer {{location}} of Helensburgh in Scotland, and in 1940 was put {{under the control of the}} Ministry of Aircraft Production. [...] In addition to its earlier functions the Establishment became responsible for acceptance tests and trials of air-sea rescue apparatus and equipment and for aircraft armament research with bombs, depth charges and projectiles, including experiments and tests in water tanks. Being the sole official experimental establishment for marine aircraft in the country, particular emphasis was placed on research, especially into seaworthiness, <b>stability</b> and control <b>on</b> <b>water,</b> and water impact loads.|$|R
40|$|Using density {{functional}} {{theory and}} periodic slabs, we have studied water formation via HCl oxidation on the Cu(1 0 0) surface. We show that while adsorbed chlorine increases the <b>stability</b> of <b>water</b> <b>on</b> the Cu(1 0 0) surface, water molecules dissociate immediately when located {{next to an}} oxygen atom. We also show that these competing interactions, when arising from HCl reacting with oxygen on Cu(1 0 0), lead to water formation according to two different pathways depending on the temperature and oxygen coverage...|$|R
50|$|The Puffin was {{powered by}} a 450 hp (336 kW) geared down Napier Lion II engine, a 12-cylinder unit with three banks of four {{cylinders}} in W or broad arrow arrangement. The radiator for the water-cooled engine was immediately {{in front of the}} engine and benefited from airflow from the two-bladed propeller. The electric starter used an internal battery. The single central float was wide and stretched aft to below {{the leading edge of the}} fin. It joined to the fuselage around the wing roots with two pairs of struts. The wheels were linked by an axle that rode in a vertical slot in the float at its deepest point, and a hand driven screw enabled them to be raised or lowered. The aft-most part of the float was hinged so it could lift up and down and provided with a tailskid and a vertical shock absorber to the fuselage. At the extreme rear was a water rudder. Two deep and wide chord floats were fitted below the outer interplane struts to provide lateral <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water.</b>|$|R
40|$|Summary. [...] A {{description}} is given {{of the various}} techniques evolved {{in recent years to}} provide model data as a basis for predicting the full-scale behaviour of a seaplane. The seaplane tank and associated equipment is described in detail, together with the routine methods of operation.

A {{description is}} given of a typical test programme on a new design to determine the longitudinal and lateral <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water,</b> spray and rough water behaviour and water drag. This description is illustrated with typical results for a modem conventional hull of length: beam ratio of about 7. Finally, the design factors affecting the longitudinal stability and spray formation are discussed in Appendices [...] 1. Introduction. [...] Considerable {{progress has been made in}} the last decade in improving the techniques of predicting the full-scale performance of seaplanes by the use of scale models in the Royal Aircraft Establishment Seaplane Tank.

5000|$|The Latécoère 23 was a {{development}} of the Latécoère 21, the latter Latécoère's first flying boat to leave the water. [...] It kept the same general arrangement, a parasol winged machine with a centrally mounted push-pull pair of engines and sponsons for <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water.</b> Its wing, {{like that of the}} earlier aircraft was very rectangular and of mixed wood and metal construction. [...] The span was increased by 27% and the wing area by about the same. The sharply cropped wingtips of the Latécoère 21 were replaced by bevelled ends of decreasing thickness. The Latécoère 23 carried full span ailerons in three sections per wing, fitted with trim tabs. [...] The wings were not attached directly to the fuselage, but to the sponsons: on each side a parallel pair of streamlined struts leaned outwards from near the tip of the sponson to mid-wing, and a second pair ran inwards to the wing centreline below the engines. On the Latécoère 21 the engines were mounted on the chord line, but the two 500 hp (373 kW) Farman 12 Wes of the later aircraft were mounted on the upper surface of the wing. Propellers were four bladed and wooden.|$|R
50|$|The Latécoère 21 was a French {{flying boat}} built in 1925 {{for use by}} Lignes Aériennes Latécoère as an {{airliner}} on routes between France and North Africa. It {{was the first of}} the Latécoère flying boats, and the first aircraft to deliver mail between Marseilles and Algiers. It was a conventional design for the era, with a monoplane wing mounted parasol-fashion. Warren truss-style struts braced the wing to stub wings that acted as sponsons for <b>stability</b> while <b>on</b> the <b>water.</b> The twin engines were placed in tandem push-pull configuration on the wing. Up to seven passengers could be seated in an enclosed cabin, and two pilots sat side by side in separate open cockpits.|$|R

50|$|Structurally {{the hull}} was {{identical}} {{with that of}} the CAMS 51, with longerons and transverse oak frames. It was covered with double teak and plywood planking below the waterline and ply elsewhere. At the nose the underside had a sharp V-section but this softened aft into a double curvature section; there were two steps, the forward one below the rear of the wing. <b>Stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> was provided by a pair of unstepped floats, strut-mounted below the interplane struts. Internally the hull was divided into five compartments by reinforced bulkheads, the first forming a hold. The next contained the pilots' enclosed cabin, which was well forward and ahead of the leading propeller, with side-by-side seats, multiple front and side windows and access panels over the seats. Behind the pilots, the radio operator's and navigator's positions were {{on opposite sides of the}} aircraft. The fourth compartment housed eight 620 L fuel tanks, with a central corridor between them providing access to the final compartment which held a toilet on one side and a bunk on the other. Behind the last bulkhead was a long, empty hold which reached back to the tail and was easily accessed though an upper, port-side hatch.|$|R
5000|$|The slender fuselage, {{which had}} a maximum width of only 1500 mm, was built around a strong {{longitudinal}} double beam which, together with other lighter longitudinal beams, located transverse frames with forked lower parts. The skin was riveted duralumin, like the wings. The 110-S's planing hull was a V with deeply concave sides, deepest at the nose then rapidly becoming more shallow rearwards approaching a small, single step. <b>Stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> was provided {{by a pair of}} V-bottomed floats, strut-mounted from the outer central section. [...] There was an open cockpit in the extreme nose for an observer, who was also responsible for navigation, radio communication and bomb dropping, fitted with a pair of machine guns on a flexible mount. 75 kg bombs were held under the wing. There was a similarly armed cockpit just aft of the wing. The pilots' open cockpit was just ahead of {{the leading edge of the}} wing, with side-by-side seating and dual controls. At the rear the tail was conventional, with an almost triangular fin blending, at its top, into a vertical-edged balanced rudder which extended down to the keel. The tailplane was positioned well clear of the spray, over halfway up the fin and braced with struts from the lower fuselage. It carried separate, straight-edged, balanced elevators.|$|R
40|$|Chlorine salts (e. g. chlorides, {{chlorates}} and perchlorates) are {{an important}} factor in the <b>stability</b> of <b>water</b> <b>on</b> the surfaces of planetary bodies. Here we have shown that perchlorate and chlorate salts will lower the freezing point of water, allowing it to be liquid down to ~ 204 K. These salts will also slow down the evaporation rate, extending the lifetime of the liquid water solution. Chlorine salts have been detected on Mars, which has significant implications for the stability of water and hence its habitability. To study their effects <b>on</b> the <b>stability</b> of <b>water</b> <b>on</b> planetary surfaces, we need to first locate where these chlorine salts exist; this is typically done by remote sensing. To date, only anhydrous chlorides have been remotely detected, mostly {{due to the lack of}} hydrated chlorine salts in the spectral libraries used to identify features. To address this deficit, we measured reflectance spectra for numerous chlorine salts. Hydration bands were most common in near-infrared spectra, with band depth and width increasing with increasing hydration state. In the mid-infrared, oxychlorine salts exhibit spectral features due to Cl-O vibrations. We also investigated the spectral features of these salts at low temperature (80 K) to compare with remote sensing data of the outer satellites, specifically Europa. At low temperature, water bands become narrower and shallower than their room temperature counterparts. We show that chlorine salts do possess distinct spectral features that should allow for their detection by remote sensing, though care must be taken to acquire laboratory spectra of all hydrated phases at the relevant conditions (e. g. temperature, pressure) for the planetary body being studied...|$|R

This turret was equipped with an Image Intensifier sight for the main armament. This II sight was the first effective passive night sight fitted to an Australian AFV, giving the MRVs a night fighting capability exceeding the Leopard AS1 and all other Australian AFVs of the period. Whilst fully amphibious, the MRV was also fitted with a light sheet metal foam filled trim vane and side pods. These pods and the trim vane were intended to provide additional flotation and <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water,</b> they provided virtually no additional armour protection. Other changes include a modified driver's hatch which pivoted toward the centre line of the vehicle instead of opening {{to the rear of}} the driver's hatch, this feature preventing the open driver's hatch being caught on the traversing turret, as well as the fitting of the British [...] "boiling vessel" [...] an electric vessel for boiling water and heating rations. As indicated by the designation change, the MRVs were roled as reconnaissance vehicles and issued to the Cavalry (medium reconnaissance) regiments, whereas the FSVs were originally issued to APC squadrons and used to provide infantry fire support.|$|R

40|$|Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. subsp. durum) {{is one of}} {{the major}} crops in the Mediterranean basin, where water stress often occurs during grain filling which {{represents}} a critical stage for the synthesis and accumulation of storage proteins (gliadins and glutenins). The aim of the study is to evaluate, by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 DE SDS-PAGE), the storage proteins composition of two durum wheat cultivars (Ciccio and Svevo) cultivated in a growth chamber under two different water regimes (control and water deficit). At milk stage and physiological maturity, gluten proteins have been extracted and separated by 2 DE SDS-PAGE. The analysis of the gels was performed by the software ImageMaster 2 D Platinum (Amersham). The results showed differences in protein expression within the different gel regions between water regimes and cultivars; under water deficit the rate of protein accumulation was faster for all the protein regions, either at milk and physiological stage. Protein accumulation within high molecular weight (H) region resulted faster in Ciccio than in Svevo mainly in the control treatment. In the low molecular weight region between 48 and 35 kDa (L 48 - 35), the cultivar Ciccio showed a higher protein expression than Svevo. Furthermore under water deficit a marked increase in H region volume and a decrease in the L 48 - 35 region was observed only for Svevo; instead in Ciccio no change was observed showing this cultivar a greater <b>stability</b> <b>on</b> changing <b>water</b> regime. Further studies by the use of mass spectrometry are necessary to identify specific peptides relative to drought stress during grain filling as well as to investigate the relationships with technological quality...|$|R
