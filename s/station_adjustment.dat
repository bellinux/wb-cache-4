At present, {{with the}} {{increasing}} development of ocean exploitation, ROV {{has been used in}} many aspects such as scientific research, military affairs and assistance, as a result many countries around the world get more value from the research work on ROV. The FROV’s (Fiber Remotely Operated Vehicle) float station usually has an important influence on its performance.

40|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography {{is a tool}} mostly used in a medical diagnosis. A development of the technique and an improvement an in accuracy of tomographic systems enabled an utilization of the tomography in industrial applications. The tomography allows non-destructive analysis of inner structure. There is a negative influence of a reconstructed area if a low-absorption and high-absorption materials are scanned together. This influence makes analysis of the inner structure impossible. There are two options to eliminate these artifacts. We can use algorithms to reduce metal artifacts, or {{we can try to}} avoid them when performing the scan. This bachelor thesis focuses on an optimization of tomographic <b>station</b> <b>adjustment</b> for the plastic components including metal parts. The effect of an usage of X-ray filter or collimator and effect of a sample orientation on data quality will be observed. We use tools like contrast, noise and edge sharpness to evaluate data quality...|$|E
40|$|Terrestrial laser {{scanning}} {{was used to}} measure snow thickness changes (perpendicular to the surface) in a rock face. The aim was to investigate the accumulation and redistribution of snow in extremely steep terrain (> 60 °). The north-east face of the Chlein Schiahorn in the region of Davos in eastern Switzerland was scanned before and several times after a snowfall event. A summer scan without snow was acquired to calculate the total snow thickness. An improved postprocessing procedure is introduced. The data quality could be increased by using snow thickness instead of snow depth (measured vertically) and by consistently applying Multi <b>Station</b> <b>Adjustment</b> to improve the registration. More snow was deposited in the flatter, smoother areas of the rock face. The spatial variability of the snow thickness change was high. The spatial patterns of the total snow thickness were {{similar to those of the}} snow thickness change. The correlation coefficient between them was 0. 86. The fresh snow was partly redistributed from extremely steep to flatter terrain, presumably mostly through avalanching. The redistribution started during the snowfall and ended several days later. Snow was able to accumulate permanently at every slope angle. The amount of snow in extremely steep terrain was limited but not negligible. Areas steeper than 60 ° received 15 % of the snowfall and contained 10 % of the total amount of snow...|$|E
40|$|Determining local {{magnitude}} (M_L) in {{a manner}} that is uniform and internally consistent for earthquakes throughout California and the vicinity is an important component of the California Integrated Seismic Network (CISN). We present a new local magnitude attenuation function and corresponding <b>station</b> <b>adjustments</b> that are valid throughout California. The new attenuation function is an analytic function of the radial hypocentral distance between 1 and 500 km. Associated <b>station</b> <b>adjustments</b> are also available for 1185 horizontal seismometer and accelerometer channels from five seismic networks operating in California. The new attenuation function and adjustments provide several advantages to CISN. They allow a more robust M_L computation, the M_Ls are more consistent between northern and southern California than they have been in the past, and because adjustments are now available for more station-network-channel-location codes (SNCLs), M_Ls can be computed for small earthquakes in more locations than was previously possible. In addition to describing our method for calibrating the new CISN M_L, we also present a tool for adding adjustments for new or upgraded stations. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{description}} of the DSN VLBI data set and of last year's analysis {{can be found in}} last year's report. Other than including another year's data, the main changes in this year's analysis from last year's are in the use of meteorological data for determining tropospheric parameters and in the weighting of the data to account for the uncertainty in the observables caused by tropospheric effects and source structure. A priori dry zenith tropospheric delays were determined from barometric pressure measurements at the DSN sites, corrected for height differences between the pressure sensor and the antennas. A priori wet zenith tropospheric delays were derived from tables of monthly average wet zenith delays for each station, which are based on historical radiosonde data. The Lanyi function was used for mapping zenith tropospheric delays to observed elevations. the temperature {{at the top of the}} boundary layer, a parameter in the Lanyi function, was taken to be the 24 -hour average of the surface temperature at the <b>station.</b> <b>Adjustments</b> to the wet troposphere zenith delays were estimated every two to three hours...|$|R

40|$|Terrestrial laser {{scanning}} (TLS) is a newer, active method of remote sensing for the automatic detection of 3 D coordinate points. This method {{has been developed}} particularly during the last 20 years, in addition to airborne and mobile {{laser scanning}} methods. All these methods use laser light and additional angle measurements {{for the detection of}} distances and directions. Thus, several thousands to hundreds of thousands of polar coordinates per second can be measured directly by an automatic deflection of laser beams. For TLS measurements, the coordinates and orientation of the origin of the laser beam can be determined to register different scan positions in a common coordinate system. These measurements are usually conducted by Global Navigation Satellite Systems or total station surveying, but also identical points can be used and data driven methods are possible. Typically, accuracies and point densities of a few centimetres to a few millimetres are achieved depending on the method. The derived 3 D point clouds contain millions of points, which can be evaluated in post-processing stages by symbolic or data-driven methods. Besides the creation of digital surface and terrain models, laser scanning is used in many areas for the determination of 3 D objects, distances, dimensions, and volumes. In addition, changes can be determined by multi-temporal surveys. The terrestrial laser scanner Riegl LMS Z- 420 i was used in this work in combination with the Differential Global Positioning System system Topcon Hiper Pro, based on Real Time Kinematic (RTK-DGPS). In addition to the direct position determination of the laser scanner, the position of a self-developed reflector on a ranging pole was measured by the RTK-DGPS system to accurately derive the orientation of each measured point cloud. Moreover, the scanner is equipped with an additional, mounted camera Nikon D 200 to capture oriented pictures. These pictures allow colouring the point cloud in true colours and thus allow a better orientation. Furthermore, the pictures can be used for the extraction of detailed 3 D information and for texturing the 3 D objects. In one of the post-processing steps, the direct georeferencing by RTK-DGPS data was refined using the Multi <b>Station</b> <b>Adjustment,</b> which employs the Iterative Closest Point algorithm. According to the specific objectives, the point clouds were then filtered, clipped, and processed to establish 3 D objects for further usage. In this dissertation, the feasibility of the method has been analysed by investigating the applicability of the system, the accuracy, and the post-processing methods by means of case studies from the research areas of coastal geomorphology, agronomy, and geoarchaeology. In general, the measurement system has been proven to be robust and suitable for field surveys in all cases. The surveys themselves, including the selected georeferencing approach, were conducted quickly and reliably. With the refinement of the Multi <b>Station</b> <b>Adjustment</b> a relative accuracy of about 1 cm has been achieved. The absolute accuracy is about 1. 5 m, limited by the RTK-DGPS system, which can be enhanced through advanced techniques. Specific post-processing steps have been conducted to solve the specific goals of each research area. The method was applied for coastal geomorphological research in western Greece. This part of the study deals with 3 D reconstructed volumes and corresponding masses of boulders, which have been dislocated by high energy events. The boulder masses and other parameters, such as the height and distance to the current sea level, have been used in wave transport equations for the calculation of minimum wave heights and velocities of storm and tsunami scenarios and were compared to each other. A significant increase in accuracy of 30...|$|E
40|$|Adjustments to data {{observed}} at pairs of climate stations have been recommended {{to remove the}} biases introduced by differences between the stations in time of observation, temperature instrumentation, latitude, and elevation. A new network of climate stations, located in rural settings, permits comparisons of temperatures for several pairs of stations without two of the biases (time of observation and instrumentation). The daily, monthly, and annual minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures were compared for five pairs of stations included in the U. S. Climate Reference Network. Significant {{differences were found between}} the paired stations in the annual minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures for all five pairs of <b>stations.</b> <b>Adjustments</b> for latitude and elevation differences contributed to greater differences in mean annual temperature for four of the five stations. Lapse rates computed from the mean annual temperature differences between station pairs differed from a constant value, whether or not latitude adjustments were made to the data. The results suggest that microclimate influences on temperatures {{observed at}} nearby (horizontally and vertically) stations are potentially much greater than influences that might be due to latitude or elevation differences between the stations. 1...|$|R

Finally, the dispatch system is described in terms of construction and process. Methods for organizing dispatch are proposed, and the processes of coordination adjustment under normal and unexpected situations are analyzed. The discussion in this paper may serve as a theoretical basis for the development of high-speed rail dispatch systems.|$|R

The objective of this research is to determine whether poorly sited long-term surface temperature monitoring sites have been adjusted in order to provide spatially representative independent data for use in regional and global surface temperature analyses. We present detailed analyses that demonstrate the lack of independence of the poorly sited data when they are adjusted using the homogenization procedures employed in past studies, as well as discuss the uncertainties associated with undocumented station moves. We use simulation and mathematics to determine the effect of trend on <b>station</b> <b>adjustments</b> and the associated effect of trend in the reference series on the trend of the adjusted station. We also compare data before and after adjustment to the reanalysis data, and we discuss the effect of land use changes on the uncertainty of measurement. A major conclusion of our analysis is that there are large uncertainties associated with the surface temperature trends from the poorly sited stations. Moreover, rather than providing additional independent information, the use of the data from poorly sited stations provides a false sense of confidence in the robustness of the surface temperature trend assessments.

This kind of multi-criteria evaluation is of importance in order to assess the global behaviour of the models. We applied such multi-criteria strategy to the Donga catchment (586 km 2), in Benin. The work is supported by a strategy of observation, undertaken since 1998 consisting in a network of 20 rain gauges, an automatic meteorological station, 6 discharge stations and 18 wells. The first goal {{of this study is to}} assess the model ability to reproduce the discharge at the outlet, the water table dynamics in several points of the catchment and the vadose zone dynamics at the sub-catchment scale. We tested two spatial discretisations of increasing resolution. To test the internal structure of the model, we looked at its ability to represent also the discharge at intermediary <b>stations.</b> After <b>adjustment</b> of soil parameters, the model is shown to accurately represent discharge down to a drainage area of 100 km 2, whereas poorer simulation is achieved on smaller catchments. We introduced the spatial variability of rainfall by distributing the daily rainfall over the REW and obtained a very low sensitivity of the model response to this variability. Our results suggest that processes in the unsaturated zone should first be improved, in order to better simulate soil water dynamics and represent perched water tables which were not included in this first modelling study...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} part of the AMMA - African Multidisciplinary Monsoon Analysis- project and aims at a better {{understanding}} and modelling of the Donga catchment (580 km 2, Benin) behaviour in order to determine its spatially distributed water balance. For this purpose, we applied the REW concept proposed by Reggiani et al.  (1998, 1999), which allows the description of the main local processes at the sub-watershed scale. Such distributed hydrological models, which represent hydrological processes at various scales, should be evaluated not only on the discharge at the outlet but also on each of the represented processes and in several points of the catchment. This multi-criteria approach is required in order to assess the global behaviour of hydrological models. We applied such multi-criteria strategy to the Donga catchment (586 km 2), in Benin. The work was supported by an observation set up, undertaken since 1998 consisting in a network of 20 rain gauges, an automatic meteorological station, 6 discharge stations and 18 wells. The main goal {{of this study was to}} assess the model's ability to reproduce the discharge at the outlet, the water table dynamics in several points of the catchment and the vadose zone dynamics at the sub-catchment scale.

Simulation of groundwater levels was poor and our results, in conjunction with new data available at the local scale, suggest that the representation of the processes in the unsaturated zone should first be improved, in order to better simulate soil water dynamics and represent perched water tables which were not included in this first modelling study...|$|R
40|$|Several recent {{dramatic}} events {{drew the}} attention {{on the need to}} carefully reassess the very rare, high-impact, seismic hazard for large urban centers and critical facilities. Following this aim, the present trend all over the world is to more and more rely on probabilistic approaches to estimate seismic hazard, and determine annual exceedance probabilities for various ground-motion levels (down to very low probability levels). Most developments regarding the probabilistic seismic hazard assessment ("PSHA") methods have been concentrated on rock sites, although many cities are located on soft soil sites, which can significantly affect the shaking. In most PSHA studies, the amplification of the soil at the site is taken into account in a crude way, where hazard estimates can be both underestimated (e. g. resonance effects are ignored) or overestimated (nonlinear effects are ignored). Critical facilities designed neglecting local site effects within the framework of PSHA may thus have unknown safety margins, with the possibility of under-design. This work contributes to provide recommendations for the incorporation of site response in PSHA estimates. We present a methodology on how to account for site-specific characterization, single <b>station</b> sigma, host-to-target <b>adjustments</b> and non-linear behavior of a soil column. In this study, we estimate the soil hazard for a 5000 years return period at the middle of the EUROSEISTEST valley, using different methods to account for site effects. We perform single station sigma hazard calculations, we apply host to target adjustments when required, we implement 1 D linear and non-linear ground motion wave propagation, to finally describe the epistemic uncertainties related to the selected site-specific approach, and its impact on a probabilistic seismic hazard estimates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The low lying {{parts of}} Holland are {{vulnerable}} to flooding and are therefore heavily protected by dykes and several pumping stations. These however cause serious obstacles to migratory fish. Pumping stations can be lethal barriers for fish migration. Currently a lot of pump manufacturers are developing new fish friendly pumps. To fit these new pumps in existing pumping <b>stations,</b> usually civil <b>adjustments</b> are required at considerable costs. A more cost effective alternative would be to perform a fish friendly upgrade of the existing pumps. During the last 3 years Flowserve conducted excessive research to increase their knowledge on fish friendly pump design. This research project led to a comprehensive calculation method to predict survivability rates of fish passing pumps. With this knowledge Flowserve has developed a very cost effective retrofit program to upgrade existing pumping stations equiped with fish unfriendly concrete volute pumps that have open axial flow screw impellers, also known as BVOP pumps. Currently Flowserve has executed several retrofit projects proving fish friendly upgrade possibilities at relatively low costs, lowering the investment threshold to solve fish migration barriers. The presentation will take you along the developments made {{the last three years}} including the full scale in house fish survivability tests performed to validate our developed calculation method. The full scale test involved a total of +/- 1800 fish at 7 different operating conditions. Hereafter we will give you insights on two current projects: • A BVOP retrofit project consisting of a new impeller/wear ring combination that fits the existing pumps without civil adjustment requirements. • The upgrade of 2 fully metal, Stork heritage, open axial flow screw impeller, diffuser pumps. To fit the geometrical constraints of these pumps, a new patented fish friendly diffuser-bend combination was develope...|$|R
40|$|The delta smelt is a small, endemic {{fish that}} {{resides in the}} upper San Francisco Estuary. They are listed under state and federal Endangered Species Acts. Since 2002, their {{abundance}} has been at record low levels. Delta smelt are entrained at state (Banks) and federal (Jones) pumping plants that export water to much of California. Export cutbacks to limit entrainment have been controversial, making delta smelt arguably the most important fish in California. Kimmerer (2008) published the first estimates of proportional entrainment (mortality relative to population size) of delta smelt at the water export pumping plants, improving on previous estimates of absolute numbers entrained. This paper comments on Kimmerer’s estimates, which ranged from 0 % to 40 % annually with considerable uncertainty reflecting the challenge in estimating the distribution and numbers of this scarce fish. Kimmerer’s high estimates in some recent years and his conclusion that entrainment effects could be episodically important are counter {{to a lack of}} statistically significant correlation between entrainment and subsequent abundance. Analysis herein justifies estimates of lower proportional entrainment than suggested by Kimmerer. Based on alternative assumptions, his highest annual estimates of adult proportional entrainment would have been no more than 13 % and could even be in the range of 5 % to 10 %. Most adjustments resulting from alternative assumptions underlying high estimates of larval-juvenile proportional entrainment cannot be quantified. However, it is argued here that eight of ten key assumptions underlying those estimates resulted in upward bias. Lower estimates of proportional entrainment would be consistent with the lack of statistically significant relationships between entrainment and subsequent abundance in previous studies and suggest that assessment of the importance of entrainment awaits additional analyses that narrow uncertainty. Findings of detection problems with adult and larval-juvenile surveys suggest adding more <b>stations</b> and other <b>adjustments</b> to resolve these problems...|$|R
