50|$|At high overall {{pressure}} ratios, {{the compression}} system is usually {{split into two}} units; a low-pressure (LP) compressor mounted on one shaft followed by a high-pressure (HP) compressor mounted on the HP shaft and driven by its own (HP) turbine. On civil turbofans, {{the first stage of}} the LP compressor is often a single-stage fan. If the HP compressor pressure ratio exceeds about 4.5:1, then the unit will probably have variable geometry (i.e. variable stators) on the first few stages, to make the <b>surge</b> <b>line</b> on the compressor map more shallow, to accommodate the shallow working line.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we outline a {{methodology}} {{to assess the}} fatigue induced in piping systems submitted to thermal stratification. More specifically. the transformation from the measured outer wall temperature time histories to stress time histories in any point of the line is treated. By means of inverse transfer functions, the fluid temperature distribution is calculated from the outside wall temperatures measured in {{a limited number of}} temperature sections. Using direct transfer functions, the local stresses due to stratification may be determined as well as the pipe free curvatures and the pipe free axial strains. Using a finite beam element model of the line, the global response of the line (in terms of displacements or stresses) due to the applied curvatures, axial strains, end point displacements, internal pressure and possible contacts with the pipe environment may be determined. The method is illustrated for the <b>surge</b> <b>lines</b> of the Doel 2 and Doel 4 nuclear power plants. An excellent correlation is found between measured and calculated displacements.

50|$|A {{compressor}} {{will only}} pump {{air in a}} stable manner {{up to a certain}} pressure ratio. Beyond this value the flow will break down and become unstable. This occurs at {{what is known as the}} <b>surge</b> <b>line</b> on a compressor map. The complete engine is designed to keep the compressor operating a small distance below the surge pressure ratio on what is known as the operating line on a compressor map. The distance between the 2 lines is known as the surge margin on a compressor map. Various things can occur during the operation of the engine to lower the surge pressure ratio or raise the operating pressure ratio. When the 2 coincide there is no longer any surge margin and a compressor stage can stall or the complete compressor can surge as explained in preceding sections.|$|E
50|$|In {{category}} A (1+2+3+4) is {{the fuel}} cladding, the protective and nonreactive outer {{layer of the}} fuel pellet, which uses {{none of the above}} features: It is always closed and keeps the fuel and the fission products inside and is not open before arriving at the reprocessing plant. In category B (2+3+4) is the <b>surge</b> <b>line,</b> which connects the hot leg with the pressurizer and helps to control the pressure in the primary loop of a PWR and uses a moving working fluid when fulfilling its mission. In category C (3+4) is the accumulator, which does not need signal input of 'intelligence' or external power. Once the pressure in the primary circuit drops below the set point of the spring-loaded accumulator valves, the valves open and water is injected into the primary circuit by compressed nitrogen. In category D (4 only) is the SCRAM which utilizes moving working fluids, moving mechanical parts and signal inputs of 'intelligence' but not external power or forces: the control rods drop driven by gravity once they have been released from their magnetic clamp. But nuclear safety engineering is never that simple: Once released the rod may not fulfil its mission: It may get stuck due to earthquake conditions or due to deformed core structures. This shows that though it is a passively safe system and has been properly actuated, it may not fulfil its mission. Nuclear engineers have taken this into consideration: Typically only a part of the rods dropped are necessary to shut down the reactor. Samples of safety systems with passive safety components can be found in almost all nuclear power stations: the containment, hydro-accumulators in PWRs or pressure suppression systems in BWRs.|$|E

Effects of inclination angle and elbows of the <b>surge</b> <b>line</b> on CCFL characteristics were also investigated experimentally. The effects of inclination angle on CCFL depend on the flow direction, that is, the effect is large for the nearly horizontal flow and small for the vertical flow at the upper junction.

The horizontal pipe model inner diameter is 305 mm with thickness of 33. 5 mm and length of four diameters. The Pressurized Water Reactor type Nuclear Power Plants operate in the range of dimensionless Froude number 0. 02 – 0. 2. Four cases for flow velocities ranging between 0. 01 and 0. 2 m/sec, based on Froude number, are considered. The propensity for stratification of the fluid in a horizontal pipe can be correlated to the dimensionless Richardson number. If the Richardson number is greater than unity thermal stratification is expected to occur and for Richardson number above 10 the natural convection dominates the flow field and a strongly stratified flow can be maintained until either the temperature difference decreases or the flow velocity increases enough to lower the value of Richardson number below 0. 1 or less. The Richardson number for the four cases is greater than unity. The transient analysis is performed using commercially available software ANSYS CFX. The transient temperature distribution along the horizontal pipe with different heat up rates is represented in this study.
