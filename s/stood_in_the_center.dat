The village of Halle was at the far right of the line while Neerwinden village was in the left-center. A screen of Coalition light troops was posted in all the hamlets along the Little Gete. Dumouriez {{organized}} eight columns of attack. Valence on the right led three attack columns against Racour and Oberwinden, the Duke of Chartres directed two columns in the center via Laer and Miranda commanded three columns on the left along the main road to Halle. The French reserve formed a final column {{on the far left}} where it was to first capture Zoutleeuw (Leau) and then swing south against Halle. Lamarche's Advance Guard operated with the Right Wing.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to move city and county {{government}} functions {{out of the state}} capitol, the city purchased a plot of land to build on in 1832. They chose a spot on the edge of De Witt's public square, along Eagle Street at the eastern terminus of Lion Street (later renamed Washington Avenue); the land was bought from St. Peter's Church for $10,295.95 ($ in modern dollars). The design of the new city hall was done by Albany architect Philip Hooker. The cornerstone was laid by Mayor John Townsend amid a Masonic ceremony, however the date of this event is in dispute. The building was completed in 1832 {{at a cost of about}} $92,000 ($ in modern dollars). The new city hall was a Greek Revival structure, built of white marble with an entrance porch supported by four Doric columns. On the roof was a gilded dome. The interior was simple, with little ornamentation, though a full-length statue of Alexander Hamilton <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the upper hall, between the Court room and the Common Council Chamber. Upon one side of this hall was a bas-relief of DeWitt Clinton, with a view of a primitive canal-boat in the distance, and on the opposite wall was a similar figure of Sir Walter Scott. The building was destroyed by fire on February 10, 1880. Plans for a replacement city hall quickly developed.|$|E

25|$|During the Renaissance, Athena donned {{the mantle}} of patron {{of the arts and}} human endeavor; allegorical {{paintings}} involving Athena were a favorite of the Italian Renaissance painters. Athena was used as a symbol for female rulers, and a series of paintings by Peter Paul Rubens depict her as the patron of Marie de' Medici. During the French Revolution, statues of pagan gods were torn down all throughout France, but statues of Athena were not. Instead, Athena was transformed into the personification of freedom and the republic and a statue of the goddess <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the Place de la Revolution in Paris. In the years following the Revolution, artistic representations of Athena proliferated.|$|E
25|$|Morgan {{was forced}} by post-lingual {{deafness}} {{as an early}} teen to communicate by letters throughout his professional life. This effort created a written network for scholars interested in Western American themes. Vast stores of correspondence indicate his willingness to help another writer or scholar, to provide information on sources and materials, or offer advice on projects. Many emerging scholars, particularly those out of the academic mainstream, considered him a mentor. As a result, Morgan <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of a scholarly group of literary figures of the 1930s through 1960s involved in history and biography of the American West. These individuals included Juanita Brooks, Fawn Brodie, Bernard DeVoto, Charles Kelly, J. Roderic Korns, A. Russell Mortensen, William Mulder, and Harold Schindler.|$|E

Her dancers were clad in Louis Vuitton Steven Sprouse printed trousers which matched Gaga's shoes. The backdrop changed to show blinking disco lights and Gaga <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> wearing her video sunglasses which display the line [...] "Pop Music Will Never Be Low Brow". A remix of the intro for [...] "Just Dance" [...] started and Gaga was joined by her dancers on stage. When the song shifts to the bridge, Gaga once again is handed her disco stick and performs the bridge with it. The ending shifts to a remixed version of the song. Then Gaga and the dancers, joined by DJ Space Cowboy or DJ Nicodemus, take a bow {{in front of the}} audience. Gaga comes back with her dance to perform the encore. The encore of the tour consisted of [...] "Boys, Boys, Boys" [...] and the original version of [...] "Poker Face". Gaga was dressed in a khaki leotard embellished with crystals. She wore an admiral's cap and gloves on her hands, both were decorated with the word Gaga on them.|$|E

500|$|On October 14, West, in {{collaboration}} with Italian artist Vanessa Beecroft, hosted a promotional album listening event at Ace Gallery. Over 700 guests were invited to preview the entirety of 808s & Heartbreak. Under Beecroft's guidance, the event featured approximately forty nude women wearing nothing besides wool masks who silently <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the room. The women were illuminated by multicolored lights that would change as the music progressed. When {{it came time for}} him to speak, West stated that he'd been a fan of Beecroft's work and strong imagery, saying that he liked the idea of nudity because [...] "society told us to wear clothes at a certain point". Beecroft had been contacted a month prior and conceptualized and generated the installation in a week. Beecroft admitted that while he had caught her offguard, she had the opportunity to hear the album for herself and heard things that touched her own life. Five days later, promotional photos for the album by photographer Willy Vanderperre were released. The images portrayed West wearing a grey glen plaid suit, large browline glasses, and a heart-shaped pin.|$|E
2500|$|Jessica <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of {{the hall}} [...] looking up and around at shadowed carvings, crannies and deeply {{recessed}} windows. This giant anachronism of a room {{reminded her of the}} Sisters' Hall at her Bene Gesserit school. But at the school the effect had been of warmth. Here, all was bleak stone. Some architect had reached far back into history for these buttressed walls and dark hangings, she thought. The arched ceiling stood two stories above her with great crossbeams she felt sure had been shipped here to Arrakis across space at monstrous cost. No planet of this system grew trees to make such beams—unless the beams were imitation wood. She thought not.|$|E

The four <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the river for three hours, waiting for a helicopter that never came, and were finally washed away at around 7:08pm in sight of family members, helpless would-be rescuers, and the lens of news cameras on the riverbank. The delay was attributed to bureaucratic red tape and three top government officials resigned, including Yu Shyi-kun, the vice Premier of Executive Yuan and two Director-Generals from National Police Agency and National Fire Agency. This Pachang-Creek incident (...) caused a field day for the news media in Taiwan and triggered a reform of the airborne emergency management system.

2500|$|He {{had a large}} temple {{built in}} his hayfield, a hundred feet long and sixty wide. Everybody had to pay a temple fee. Thor was the god most honoured there. It was rounded on the inside, like a vault, and there were windows and wall-hangings everywhere. The image of Thor <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> with other gods on both sides. In front of them was an altar made with great skill and covered with iron on the top. On this {{there was to be}} a fire which would never go outthey called it sacred fire. On the altar was to lie a great armband, made of silver. The temple godi was to wear it on his arm at all gatherings, and {{everyone}} was to swear oaths on it whenever a suit was brought. A great copper bowl was to stand on the altar, and into it was to go all the blood which came from animals or men given to Thor. They called this sacrificial blood [...] and the sacrificial blood bowl [...] This blood was to be sprinkled over men and animals, and the animals that were given in sacrifice were to be used for feasting when sacrificial banquets were held. Men whom they sacrificed were to be cast into a pool which was outside by the door; they called it Blótkelda (Well of Sacrifice).|$|E
2500|$|Just {{as in the}} {{previous}} match, the Arena Mexico crowd was decidedly [...] "pro rudo" [...] for the first Luchas de Apuestas match, supporting La Amapola as she faced off against [...] "La Más Bonita" [...] Estrellita in the third match of the night. Throughout most of the match the crowd chanted for La Amapola and booed when Estrellita was in control of the match. Estrellita was seconded by La Máscara for this important match while La Amapola had Ephesto in her corner for the night, neither corner man was based on any existing, ongoing storylines. Estrellita won the first fall in quick fashion when she used the La Casita cradle hold to get the three count. In the second fall La Fleur Lethal, as La Amapola is also known, got the upper hand and quickly evened the score between the two. The third fall was longer, more drawn out than the first two falls combined and saw La Amapola almost win on more than one occasion. In the end Estrellit trapped her opponent in an armbar submission hold and managed to keep La Amapola away from the ring ropes. With no way of escaping La Amapola reluctantly gave up and lost the third fall and thus the match. A visibly infuriated La Amapola <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the ring as all of her long blond hair was shaved off as per the match stipulation, she even grabbed the clippers and did part of the shaving herself. After the haircut Estrellita displayed La Amapola's hair, celebrating a victory that seemed to not be popular with the Arena Mexico crowd but was expected.|$|E
