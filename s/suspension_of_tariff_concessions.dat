40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} history of {{bilateral}} trade negotiations between Taiwan and the U. S. The question posed at the outset is: does bilateralism enhance or jeopardize multilateralism? The U. S. -Taiwan experience seems to suggest a grossly negative answer. Bilateral negotiations for market opening {{with the threat of}} unilateral trade sanctions (such as Section 301 action) tend to encourage trade preferences and U. S. negotiators are inclined to accept such preferential arrangements in areas where U. S. domestic interests are homogeneous and concentrated. Even in the case <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> negotiations where any <b>tariff</b> <b>concessions</b> made by Taiwan are extended to other trading partners on an MFN basis, bilateralism does not necessarily enhance multilateral principles. The scope <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>concessions</b> made by Taiwan shows a strong bias in favor of the sectors in which the U. S. has a comparative advantage in Taiwan's market and the sectors in which U. S. domestic industries exhibit monopoly power. Meanwhile, U.

40|$|In the mid- 2000 s, Beijing made {{a series}} of {{unilateral}} trade concessions with respect to agricultural trade with Taiwan. This move distressed the then incumbent party of the Republic of China, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), because Beijing's offers might weaken the DPP's rural support. This article offers the first empirical assessment of Beijing's trade concessions. Using an original and highly disaggregate dataset at the township-product level, it examines what types of regions {{were more likely to be}} the beneficiary of the trade concessions, whether the concessions caused any production change, and the extent to which these changes undermined the DPP's electoral support. It is found that while the benefit <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>concession</b> was not confined to pro-DPP regions, the townships that grew tariff-reduced products were no less likely to vote for the DPP.

40|$|Abstract In many extant {{analyses}} {{of the impact of}} non-reciprocal system of trade preferences it is typical to focus on the details of market access value <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>concessions</b> as explanation for why export of beneficiaries’ products may or may not respond to incentives. Very often the role that supply-related factors can and do play in the process is relegated to the background.

While the schedules <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>concessions</b> negociated will provide more security for market access,. their value also will depend on rules limiting alternative forms of protection.

Exporting nations, however, will have to ensure that any future interpretations of normative terms defining rules and procedures do not give rise to a growing variety of non-tariff barriers, more particularly SPS and TBT measures. For this purpose, they will be able in last resort...|$|R

40|$|This study {{contains}} a careful, detailed {{examination of the}} likely macroeconomic impacts <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>concessions,</b> as part <b>of</b> the Doha Round, on developing countries.

The products which record increase in exports/imports within the TPP region are apparel, mineral fuels, leather, textile, metal products, machinery, electrical equipment and livestock and meat products.

Although China is an original member of GATT, the new government {{had not been able}} to participate in GATT activities and had been kept away from the multilateral trade system ever since its inception.

Although China is an original member of GATT, the new government of the PRC has not participated in GATT activities for thirty years. By seeking GATT membership, China hopes to eliminate various kinds of discriminatory quantitative restrictions, to enjoy the MFN treatment of GATT to play a major role in world trade, to learn how to do business in multilateral trade system and to protect its interest through GATT systems.

40|$|This audit {{assessed}} the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service 2 ̆ 7 s administration <b>of</b> the <b>Tariff</b> <b>Concession</b> System. Audit objective and criteria The {{objective of the}} audit {{was to assess the}} Australian Customs and Border Protection Service 2 ̆ 7 s administration <b>of</b> the <b>Tariff</b> <b>Concession</b> System. To form a conclusion against the objective, the audit adopted the following high-level criteria: 	an appropriate governance framework to support the effective operation of the system was established; 	a consistent, accountable and transparent assessment process for TCO applications has been implemented; 	processes and systems for the ongoing management, review and eventual revocation of TCOs are effective; and 	the approach to managing compliance with TCO requirements was sound. Overall conclusion Imposing duty on certain imported goods is designed to influence the flow of trade by regulating their value to protect Australia’s local economy and industry. In 2013 – 14, goods to the value of 338  billion were imported into Australia, with 9. 3  billion in customs duty collected. There are, however, a number of ways that importers can obtain duty-free entry of imported goods to Australia, including through accessing duty concession schemes, such as the <b>Tariff</b> <b>Concession</b> System (TCS). To receive a duty concession under the TCS, an imported good must be covered by a current <b>Tariff</b> <b>Concession</b> Order (TCO) made by Customs. A TCO consists <b>of</b> a <b>tariff</b> classification and text describing the good. As at October 2014, there were over 15   000 current TCOs available for use by importers. Under the TCS, around 1. 8  billion in revenue to the Commonwealth was forgone in 2013 – 14. Customs is responsible for administering the TCS, including assessing TCO applications, objections and revocations. In 2013 – 14, Customs received 941 applications for, and 133 objections to, TCO applications, made 770 TCOs, refused 79 TCOs and revoked 327 TCOs. Customs is also responsible for managing compliance with TCS requirements and providing assurance that importers applying a TCO to reduce customs duty are eligible to do so. The TCS is supported by mature administrative arrangements that provide a generally sound basis for the assessment and management of TCOs, including the processing of TCO applications, objections, revocations, as well as the management of TCOs that are in use. There are, however, aspects of Customs’ administrative arrangements that could be further improved, including by: 	developing a communications strategy for the TCS to maximise the effectiveness of communications and awareness raising activities, with a particular focus on local manufacturer engagement; and 	more clearly documenting TCO application assessment activities, in particular the basis on which applications are assessed as meeting legislative requirements, to provide greater assurance regarding the integrity of the assessment and decision-making process. Within the context of Customs’ broader compliance responsibilities, the limited resources assigned to TCS compliance are allocated on a risk basis and, overall, the small number of targeted compliance activities undertaken has identified TCO misuse. Nevertheless, Customs is not well placed to determine whether its activities directed at managing TCS compliance, including education and awareness activities through to enforcement action, are effectively addressing the risks arising from TCO misuse. This is primarily due to the: manner in which Customs collects and stores its compliance data, which makes it difficult to verify the number, scope and outcome of compliance activities; and absence of an appropriate set of performance measures against which an assessment of the effectiveness of compliance activities can be undertaken. To further improve Customs’ administration of the TCS and strengthen compliance monitoring arrangements, the ANAO has made three recommendations designed to: enhance engagement with key stakeholders; provide greater assurance regarding the assessment and decision-making process; and improve the monitoring and reporting of compliance activities...|$|R

40|$|Although the GATT is emblematic among {{multilateral}} agreements in pursuing {{the removal of}} trade restrictions, it includes {{a considerable number of}} exceptions that allow the WTO Members to impose new ones. Art. XXVIII permits the WTO Members, upon negotiations with specified categories of other Members, to withdraw or increase the binding tariff rates on certain products listed in their Schedules of concessions. As these new arrangements are conducted outside a Round of multilateral negotiations, which is the traditional context for reciprocation <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>concessions,</b> they are called “renegotiations”. Art. XXVIII is thus prominent among the GATT exceptions, since it is designed to counteract what is considered as the core of the GATT obligations, notably the commitment under Art. II not to increase tariffs listed in the Schedules of concessions. GATS Art. XXI is analogous to Art. XXVIII, though it differs from the GATT provision in some procedural respects. Clearly enough, the rationale underlying Art. XXVIII is to provide the WTO Members with some flexibility in their liberalisation commitments. <b>Tariff</b> <b>concessions</b> made in the course of multilateral Rounds might become unexpectedly burdensome after consolidation. Some mechanisms for the adjustment <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> commitments were thus introduced in the GATT to relieve the WTO Members from import surpluses. The renegotiation procedure envisaged in Art. XXVIII is perhaps the principal of these mechanisms but not the exclusive one. The “emergency action on imports of particular products” provided for in Art. XIX and the additional tariff flexibilities to be granted to developing countries in order to protect infant industries according to Art. XVIII are other relevant examples <b>of</b> adjustments <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> commitments in the interval between two Rounds of multilateral negotiations. Unlike Articles XVIII and XIX, Art. XXVIII does not require the WTO Member willing to withdraw or increase its tariff rates to produce evidence of the negative effects of the existent rates on its domestic market. Art. XXVIII was conceived as a tool to be used by the WTO Members in the ordinary run of multilateral trade and not under the pressure of special or emergency domestic circumstances, such as a crisis of production or the establishment of an infant industry. In order to discourage WTO Members from recurring to renegotiations routinely – an occurrence which would seriously undermine the GATT predictability –, the drafters of Art. XXVIII assigned to the major trading partners of the Member seeking modification or withdrawal with respect to the product concerned a right to compensation or, as a last resort, a right to counter-retaliate. Most of Art. XXVIII provisions are procedural. According to Art. XXIV: 6, these same procedures are to be followed by those WTO Members which raise their binding tariffs {{as a result of their}} entrance into, or implementation of, a regional trade agreement creating a customs union. The establishment of a common external tariff on certain products, which is intrinsic to the economic pattern of a customs union, is indeed likely to lead one or more of the separate customs territories forming a customs union to raise their tariffs with a view to make them uniform to the common external tariff. Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) usually do not have a provision similar to GATT Art. XXVIII, while, for example, all of them contain a safeguard clause such as the one provided in GATT Art. XIX. In general, instances of recourse to Art. XXVIII have considerably decreased in number over the years. As from 1958, renegotiations started to be predominantly conducted under Art. XXVIII: 5. The gradual shift to this modality of renegotiations is easy to understand: under this provision, the WTO Members can act with a relative freedom, since they have neither to respect the time-limit of Art. XXVIII: 1 neither to obtain the authorization prescribed by Art. XXVIII: 4. As in practice the right of retaliation has been exercised very rarely, it is to be presumed that the negotiations on compensation have been successful on average. However, there could have been other reasons which might have deterred the WTO Members from resorting to retaliations. Principally, they might have feared that third WTO Members, i. e. Members other than the Member having originally withdrawn or modified its concessions, could at their turn counter-counter-retaliate, withdrawing or modifying concessions of exporting interest for the Members having taken retaliatory actions first. Since, as illustrated above, a concession must be withdrawn or modified on a MFN basis, there is, as a result, an inherent difficulty in effectively implementing the retaliation provision of Art. XXVIII: 3...|$|R

Non-tariff achievements included {{the establishment of the}} GATT Antidumping Code of 1967, which gave a procedural framework for negotiating dumping accusations and expanded upon the original Article VI in GATT. The round can also be seen as a success for developing nations. A [...] "Trade and Development" [...] section was added to the GATT charter; its most significant feature was excepting developing nations from the rule of reciprocity. It also called for the stabilization of raw material prices. Further, the agricultural grains arrangement provided for higher minimum trading prices as well as a food aid program to developing countries. Some progress was also made with negotiations on commodities. The round extended the Long Term Cotton Textile Arrangement for another three years and provided frameworks for negotiating steel, aluminum, chemicals, pulp, and paper tariffs.|$|R

40|$|At the {{forefront}} of empirical research on Australia's trade policies two items seem to have attracted consideiable interest (i) the host of determinants of the highly dispersed <b>tariff</b> <b>concessions,</b> and (ii) the impact of liberalization on imports. Studies that investigate the former, {{in the context of}} endogenous trade policy formation, examine the impact of import penetration on tariffs, and studies that investigate the latter consider the effect <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> on import penetration. Despite the obvious simultaneity of these variables, research lines (i) and (ii) followed separate paths by only considering uni-directional causal relationships. And yet, these paths do converge. The meeting point: perplexing results! Tariffs are found to protect those industries that have the least use for protection, and liberalization is often determined to be entirely ineffectual in stimulating imports. In this paper we argue that the source of these puzzling results is found in the misspecification of the employed frameworks of analysis that ignore relevant feedback effects. This is illustrated using a model that facilitates the simultaneous determination of import penetration and tariffs. the results are startling. When the bi-directional causal relationship between the two variables is "disentangled" the estimated impact of import penetration on the tariff level increases by a fivefold, and that <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> on import penetration doubles...|$|R
