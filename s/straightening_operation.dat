40|$|Since several years, {{the large}} shipyards use {{more and more}} thin plates to build up {{stiffened}} panels in order to decrease the structural weight. The major problem relating to the utilization of thin plates is the occurrence of welding distortions {{that have to be}} eliminated for esthetical and service reasons. This <b>straightening</b> <b>operation</b> involves significant costs and it seems thus important to characterize its economical impact on the global hull fabrication. This paper presents a way to minimize cost in shipbuilding industry by the implementation of a producibility fuzzy metric in order to obtain a better knowledge of the straightening process. Attention has been focused on the definition of fuzzy rules by experts but also on the optimisation of the decision surface to reduce the error compared to actual measurement points.

40|$|By {{a special}} {{plastometric}} method, the <b>straightening</b> <b>operation</b> of a vertically cast strand of two carbon steels was simulated. The temperature {{dependence of the}} low strain rate plasticity of both the steels examined is analogous although caused by very different reasons. As to the plain carbon steel, the amount of ferrite and its location is of prime importance, whereas {{in the case of}} eutectoid steel various modes of fracture and the influence of temperature on the relative plasticity of type II MnS inclusions are influencial. To avoid transverse cracking, it seems to be suitable to keep the strand at a rather high temperature (above 900 degrees C). Temperature cycling seems to be fundamental as to the structural changes taking place in the strand (grain size refining, ferrite fraction if any), whereas analogous influences of straining are more or less inexpressive. Of course, the results obtained are of quality only since the practical and laboratory conditions differ significantly. The knowledge obtained could be applied in regulating the intensity of strand cooling with the aim of lowering the waste portion and improving the surface quality of worked products...|$|E

40|$|The {{high energy}} wheel/rail impact forces arising from defects such as poorly aligned welds in rails can in time cause serious defects in track {{components}} and deterioration of geometry. Suitable weld <b>straightening</b> <b>operations</b> improve the matter {{but there is}} uncertainty about the longevity of the effect and about what degree of misalignment (dip or peak) warrants straightening. Three 2 km long test sections were established on the Mt Isa Line in Queensland {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of weld <b>straightening</b> <b>operations.</b> Each section received different levels of intervention to correct the welds and over 15, 000 measurements of weld alignment were recorded and analysed over the life of the project. For welds with a dip less than 0. 3 mm, straightening produced no improvement. Cycle tamping produced an improvement in the alignment of dipped welds but cycle grinding produced a slight worsening of dipped welds. After approximately 4 million gross tonnes of traffic the straightened welds appeared to remain unaltered by and large; those welds which received no straightening showed a minor worsening of both dipped and peaked welds due to the traffic...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhen {{manufactured}} parts undergo large deformations {{during the}} manufacturing process, the global specifications {{of a part}} based {{on the concept of}} tolerance zone defined in the ISO 1101 standard [1] enable one to control the part's global defects. However, the extent of this tolerance zone is too large when the objective is to minimize local defects, such as hollows and bumps. Therefore, it is necessary to address local defects and global defects separately. This paper refers to the ISO 10579 standard [2] for flexible parts, which enables us to define a stressed state in order to measure the part by straightening it to simulate its position in the mechanism. The originality of this approach is that the <b>straightening</b> <b>operation</b> is performed numerically by calculating the displacement of a cloud of points. The results lead to a quantification of the global defects through various simple models and enable us to extract local defects. The outcome is an acceptable tolerance solution. The procedure is first developed for the simple example of a steel bar with a rectangular cross section, then applied to an industrial case involving a complex 3 D surface of a turbine blade. The specification is described through ISO standards both in the free state and in the straightened state...|$|E
40|$|The hot {{tensile test}} {{has been used}} for a variety of steels, to {{investigate}} the influence of such factors as inclusions, precipitation, phase transformation and grain size on hot ductility. Tests were performed in the temperature range 700 - 1000 °C and at a strain. 4 _ 2 1 rates of (10 — 10 S), generally to simulate the conditions experienced during the <b>straightening</b> <b>operation</b> in the continuous casting process in which transverse cracks propagate. Two zones of reduced ductility can be identified. The Y-a transformation zone which has been shown to produce a significant ductility trough due to strain concentration in the softer ferrite films surrounding the V grains, cating voiding around he MnS inclusions which link to give intergranular failure, and factors which alter the A 3 temperature, such as carbon content, have been shown to produce a change in the temperature at which the ductility trough occurs. The second zone of reduced hot ductility was observed in the austenite region, due to the retardation of dynamic recrystallisation associated with the presence of fine carbides, nitrides and/or inclusions precipitates at the austenite grain boundaries, which allows intergranular cracks to develop. The depth and width of this ductility trough is primarily dependent on the size and amount of precipitates present. The influence of MnS inclusions in reducing hot ductility has been noted above and below the Ae 3 temperature. Above the Ae 3, inclusions act in a similar way to fine precipitation preventing dynamic recrystallisation and below the Ae 3, they offer more sites for micro-voiding to occur. Although grain size refinement improves ductility, it does so as long as similarity in precipitate volume fraction and size exist. Improved hot ductility has been achieved by adding Ca to the steel which reduces the amount of l 9 nS inclusions precipitated during cooling from solution temperature at the austenite grain boundaries...|$|E
40|$|The loss of hot {{ductility}} (HD) {{of steel}} during continuous casting is usually {{attributed to the}} intergranular precipitation of V and Nb (C, N) as well as segregation of atoms to grain boundaries. This loss of hot ductility in the temperature range 700 [...] 1100 °C in carbon and low alloy steels is related to transverse surface cracks during the <b>straightening</b> <b>operation</b> of the continuous casting process of steel. An additional problem, found in peritectic steels, is its very coarse as cast structure, which is very prone to cracking during the straightening stage. In this regard, two major solutions have been suggested to date to improve hot ductility, adjusting the straightening stage to be below or above the low hot ductility region and chemical composition modification. However, both the solutions have limitations {{and the problem of}} cracking during continuous casting is still persistent. In this study, a peritectic steel was melted in-situ and the hot ductility trough was quantified at temperatures ranging from 700 to 1100 °C. It was also subjected to very high temperature deformation in the single phase austenite region (1400 [...] 1300 °C) during cooling from the solidus temperature. It was noticed that such deformation can improve the hot ductility, which could alleviate cracking problem during continuous casting. Microstructural studies showed that such improvement can be attributed to grain refinement owing to dynamic recrystallization during the deformation applied after solidification. Fracture analysis revealed that the deformation altered the grain boundary segregation as well. The Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) measurements showed that the very high temperature deformation lowered the concentration of detrimental elements, such as S, N, Mn and C, at grain boundaries. This also contributed to the HD improvements. The steel specimens were also reheated to temperatures below the solidus and subjected to the very high temperature deformation prior to HD testing. As was expected, the reheated specimens showed better HD than the melted ones. Microstructural examination showed that the very high temperature deformation encouraged recrystallization and grain refinement. AES studies of the reheated specimens showed no change in concentration of detrimental elements...|$|E

40|$|Three salt marshes on a 50 -km {{transect}} {{along the}} north bank of the Westerschelde Estuary were investigated to determine whether salt marshes in the estuary had responded to shipping channel modifications in recent decades. Marsh accretion rates were estimated mainly from 137 Cs profiles with further evidence from 241 Am because changes in both rate of deposition {{and nature of the}} accreting material precluded use of standard 210 Pbexcess dating models. The 137 Cs profiles usually show peaks corresponding to atmospheric deposition from the 1963 fallout maximum and sometimes from the Chernobyl accident, although intervening enhanced 137 Cs activities derived from the nuclear reprocessing marine discharges of Sellafield and La Hague are clearly discernible.

40|$|Rail {{is a very}} {{expensive}} component of the railway track. Therefore, research methods extending rail life have great economic importance. During {{the past thirty years}} and, particularly during the past ten years there has been an increasing awareness throughout most rail networks {{in the world of the}} need to introduce improved design criteria, better construction techniques and higher standard track generally. This implies that quality control at all levels is mandatory if these objectives are to be achieved. With the improved understanding of degradation of track, a more complete comprehension of the costs associated with different operating and infrastructure conditions should also be developed, aiding in the determination of efficient maintenance costs and their contribution to access charges. Track and structures together account for 60 % of maintenance costs, with 50 % of the total being track. The UIC has done a lot of work on comparative performance indicators, and these show what potential savings much be out there for the taking, just by adopting current best practice. The old wisdom is that it's not enough o do things rights; we have to make sure that we do the right things. These developments have largely resulted from the demand for higher speeds particularly in passenger services and the demand to accept heavier axle loads of freight traffic. Whilst the conventional railway track structure is not likely to change significantly over the next ten years there will be a requirement over that period for better quality track infrastructure. This means less rail surface defects, less internal defects and less wheels irregularities. The presence of rail surface defects generally increases the roughness of the track leading to a poor passenger ride and increased safety risk with freight traffic. In addition, rail surface defects will generally increase the degradation rate of other track components; however, not all defects will produce visible track deterioration. Dynamic impacts produced by the rollingstock running over rail surface defects, such as poor welds, will, over time, create continuous rail defects, loosening of fastenings, abrasion and skewing of sleepers, crushing of ballast and loss of formation geometry. It is only in the recent years that the importance of poor welds in track has been identified. Dips and peaks must be recognised as a severe track irregularity that needs to be addressed and removed. Current maintenance activities have little effect on removing misaligned welds in track and the improvement obtained after the maintenance works is generally short lived. On the other hand, <b>straightening</b> <b>operations</b> have proven to solve the problem and maintain the results following 7 months of traffic. As part of this project, a six kilometre test section was selected on the Mt Isa Line and all welds located in this region were monitored for over 9 months to increase the understanding of the effect of individual maintenance activities on the track roughness. Three 2 km Divisions were established; each Division had different maintenance activities and levels of intervention completed over the duration of the project. Over 15, 000 readings were recorded and analysed. The following conclusions were drawn. The effect of cycle tamping was clearly identified when comparing the means of weld located in Division 1, 2 to the mean of welds in Division 3. Cycle tamping showed to have a significant positive effect on the dipped welds geometry and an increase in severity of peaked welds prior to their correction. <b>Straightening</b> <b>operations</b> completed in Division 1 and 2 reduced the overall mean of weld misalignments. These Divisions were subjected to different levels of straightening intervention however they produced similar results. Division 1 all dips were straightened and Division 2 only dips > 0. 3 mm were straightened. This means that no additional benefit, in terms of overall misalignment of welds, can be gained when <b>straightening</b> <b>operations</b> target dips with a misalignment smaller than 0. 3 mm. Cycle grinding proved to have little effect on the removal of both dips and peaks. In fact, due to the configuration of the grinding machine, grinding operation produced a slight worsening of the dips misalignments and only a minor improvement of peaks. Although long term monitoring of the site may show minor variations in weld geometry performance, after approximately 3. 9 Mgt of traffic the mean of dipped welds in Division 1 and 2 appeared to remain unaltered, as Division 3 showed a minor worsening. Furthermore, the mean of peaked welds in Division 1 and 2 appeared to remain unaltered, as Division 3 showed a minor worsening...|$|R
40|$|The LBR- 5 {{software}} allows optimizing ship structures {{according to}} objectives of higher inertia, less weight and/or lower cost. This last criterion offers {{the choice between}} two approaches of calculation. The first approach {{is based on a}} simplified assessment of the cost in which the total cost is described by rather simple analytical functions which bring into play on the one hand the design variables {{and on the other hand}} empirical parameters. In the second approach, the calculation of the cost is based on data specific to the shipyard. The material cost is analyzed according to the first approach while the cost of the labor considers each relevant operation of the ship building with respect to the LBR- 5 model. A survey of all the tasks was carried out at Aker Yards France, and a thorough study made it possible to develop assessment tools of the labor cost for each operation as functions of the design variables.
