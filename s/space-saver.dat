500|$|MY09.5: {{upgrades}} affected models {{ordered from}} 21 October 2008 and produced from November. Instrument cluster illumination was commonised to white. The turn-by-turn navigation and Berlina V8 options were removed. Engine wise, the [...] "premium" [...] {{version of the}} Alloytec V6 was now fitted to the Omega and Berlina, bringing improved fuel consumption and a slight reduction in engine output (see above). A range of safety upgrades were also introduced (see above). Further MY09.5 changes were introduced in March 2009. The <b>space-saver</b> spare wheel were discontinued and replaced by two no-cost options: either a lightweight tyre inflator kit or a full-size spare wheel (previously an extra cost). Sportwagon variants of the Calais V and SS V receive an alloy spare wheel if the full-size spare is chosen, while {{the remainder of the}} line-up receives a steel wheel spare. March also signalled an opportunity for Holden to replace the dark-grey horizontal dashboard strip and steering wheel spokes as used on the SV6, SS and SS V to a matte silver type. The safety improvements made to the Omega sedan from October production onwards were also introduced for the Omega Sportwagon (see above), and the [...] "V-Series" [...] insignia used on SS V and Calais V models was removed, replaced by a single [...] "SS V" [...] or [...] "Calais V" [...] badge.|$|E
50|$|William Lawrence Murphy {{took out}} a patent for making “In-A-Dor bed”, which {{is known as a}} “Murphy bed” today. It’s {{characterized}} with the folded <b>space-saver</b> into a wall-closet.|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{vehicles}} {{are provided with}} a [...] "limited use" [...] spare tire, {{also known as a}} [...] "space-saver," [...] "donut", or [...] "compact" [...] spare tire [...] - [...] in an attempt to reduce cost, lower the vehicle's weight, and/or to save on the space that would be needed for a full-size spare tire. These supposed benefits are highly debatable; a <b>space-saver</b> is typically only 7 kg lighter than a full-sized wheel and in some cars the so-called 'space-saver' may actually save little to no space. There is also the difficulty of transporting the full-sized wheel and tire once the <b>space-saver</b> has been fitted. The spare is usually mounted on a plain steel rim. They are typically smaller than the normal tires on the vehicle and can only be used for limited distances because of their short life expectancy and low speed rating. As well, due to the different size of a donut compared to regular wheel, electronic stability control and traction control systems will not operate properly and should be disabled until the original wheel is restored. Space saver spare tires also severely compromise the braking (especially on cars not fitted with anti-lock brakes) and handling of the car.|$|E

5000|$|A {{spare tire}} or spare tyre (or stepney) is an {{additional}} tire (or tyre - see spelling differences) carried in a motor vehicle {{as a replacement for}} one that goes flat, a blowout, or other emergency. Spare tire is generally a misnomer, as almost all vehicles actually carry an entire wheel with a tire mounted on it as a spare rather than just a tire, as fitting a tire to a wheel would require a motorist to carry additional, specialized equipment. However, some spare tires ("space-saver" [...] and [...] "donut" [...] types) are not meant to be driven long distances. <b>Space-savers</b> have a maximum speed of around 50 mi/h km/h.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} saw {{an amount}} of changes and upgrades that was {{as long as the}} ones on the outside. The most noticeable difference is the deletion of the trunk, leaving a completely open compartment that carried a standard small high-pressure <b>space-saver</b> spare tire. The removal of the trunk meant the relocation of the rear stereo speakers to the rear panel behind the tail lights like in the Rally (Spirit liftback) models. The original fixed Lerma rear bench seat was replaced by the same unit used in the Camioneta American (Concord wagon) incorporating a fold down mechanism for an improved and expanded cargo capacity, retaining its unique original Lerma upholstery design. In terms of appearance, both seats and side panel designs were the same as the year before with only smaller added details for a slightly more luxurious look.|$|E
5000|$|Halfway {{through the}} 1984 model year, a new <b>space-saver</b> spare wheel was added, that {{provided}} {{room for a}} larger fuel tank (with a second [...] "transfer" [...] fuel pump). Leather interior, power windows and mirrors, air conditioning, and a manual sunroof were options for all years. The 1984 model year saw the return of two windshield wipers (vs the large single wiper), absent since the 1976 models. Eleven different engines were offered in the Type 2 Scirocco over the production run, although not all engines were available in all markets. These engines included both carburetor and fuel injection engines. Initially all models had eight-valve engines. A 16-valve head was developed by tuner Oettinger in 1981, with the modification adopted by Volkswagen when they showed a multi-valve Scirocco at the 1983 Frankfurt Motor Show. It went on sale in Germany {{and a few other}} markets in July 1985, with a catalyzed model arriving in 1986. Displacements ranged from 1.3 liters up to 1.8 liters. Power ranged from 44 kW (60 PS) to 82 kW (112 PS) for the 8 valve engines and either 95 kW (129 PS) or 102 kW (139 PS) for the 16 valve engines.|$|E

50|$|For 1986, {{few changes}} marked the new DeVille's {{second year in}} production. An {{anti-lock}} braking system, developed by Teves, became available. A 2-position automatic rear-view mirror utilized two electronic 'eyes' and a small motor to dim when headlights appeared from behind. A factory-installed cellular telephone joined the option list at an astonishing $2,850. The standard <b>space-saver</b> spare tire now sat horizontally in the trunk, doing away with the small covered storage cubby in the spare tire well from last year. The optional aluminum wheels had new flush-fitting center caps (last year's design featured exposed capped lugs), and bumper rub strips changed from black to gray. Borrowed from the front-wheel-drive Fleetwood line, the narrow lower body side molding from the 1985 DeVille was replaced with a considerably wider one, and the trim surround from the rear window gave the formal appearance of a smaller window opening. Inside, a more tailored look {{was applied to the}} seat trim. Coupe de Ville's popular cabriolet option, featuring a padded vinyl covering over the rear half of the roof, was priced at $698. Along with the exterior changes made to 1986 DeVilles, adding the Cabriolet option made it difficult to distinguish a 1986 Coupe de Ville from the 1986 Fleetwood Coupe. Pricing for the Coupe de Ville was $19,669, with Sedan de Ville at $19,990. The transverse-mounted Cadillac 4.1-liter V-8 continued from the previous year, but with 5 more horsepower.|$|E
3000|$|... qThe term ‘context {{of culture}} and situation’ is {{sometimes}} abbreviated to just ‘context’ or just ‘situation’, neither of which by itself is a satisfactory focus, {{though it is a}} great <b>space-saver!</b> I have used the term ‘context’, except where the discourse requires clarification as for example in showing the difference between the ‘context’ and ‘material situational setting’ (Hasan, [1999]; [2009 a]; in press a).|$|E
