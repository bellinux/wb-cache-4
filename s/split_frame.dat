Aloha-based algorithms estimate the number of tags and assign the proper number of slots to reduce the probability of tag collisions.

The major {{difference is that the}} former dynamically adjusts the number of slots allocated for each frame and allows all unrecognized tags to share these slots while the latter splits unrecognized tags into different collision sets and allows each set to use individual slots separately. However, a limitation of aloha-based algorithms is the starvation problem, in which the tag cannot be identified because its responses are constantly colliding with others.|$|R

However, the codewords in these codes are rather short, and this dictates the construction of the parity packets, which are usually visualized as arranging information packets row-wise and running the FEC code column-wise [6, 7].
