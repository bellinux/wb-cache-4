25|$|In {{addition}} to {{large numbers of}} noncombatants, Bohemond's force probably numbered about 10,000, the majority on foot. Military figures of the time often imply perhaps several men-at-arms per knight (i.e., a stated force of 500 knights is assumed to contain perhaps 1,500 men-at-arms in addition), so it <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> that Bohemond had with him approximately 8,000 men-at-arms and 2,000 cavalry.|$|E
25|$|Thinking {{and feeling}} are the {{decision-making}} (judging) functions. The thinking and feeling functions are both {{used to make}} rational decisions, based on the data received from their information-gathering functions (sensing or intuition). Those who prefer thinking tend to decide things from a more detached standpoint, measuring the decision by what <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable,</b> logical, causal, consistent, and matching a given set of rules. Those who prefer feeling tend to come to decisions by associating or empathizing with the situation, looking at it 'from the inside' and weighing the situation to achieve, on balance, the greatest harmony, consensus and fit, considering {{the needs of the}} people involved. Thinkers usually have trouble interacting with people who are inconsistent or illogical, and tend to give very direct feedback to others. They are concerned with the truth and view it as more important.|$|E
25|$|John Stacpoole, Mason's biographer, made {{a careful}} {{comparison}} of his architecture against his peers', {{and found him}} superior to most of his contemporaries. This <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable,</b> although of his strict contemporaries there were relatively few in New Zealand and fewer still when Mason made his greatest contribution after his move to Dunedin. There it is natural to measure him against younger men such as R.A. Lawson (1833–1902) and Francis Petre (1847–1918), both acknowledged eminences among New Zealand's Victorian architects. Mason's active career did overlap Lawson's, though scarcely Petre's, but the comparison is somewhat skewed because these practitioners represented significantly different moments of architectural thought. In terms {{of the volume of}} his output, and that of his successive partnerships, Mason made a significant impact. As a professional he was highly regarded, a senior figure people turned to for advice on difficult matters. But in the Post Office, or Stock Exchange, he designed the first building in New Zealand of more than local distinction. Were it not for its neglect and demise he would now be recalled as the country's first significant architect.|$|E

500|$|Given the {{propensity}} for battles {{to take place}} in border regions, it <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> to seek a location close to the perimeter of the Hiberno-Norse kingdom of Dublin. On that account, the suggestion of Lloyd, which places the battle at a gap now crossed by the Naas Road on the section between Kill and Rathcoole, is still worthy of consideration. In any event, the engagement took place within an easy day’s march of Dublin, as Brian pressed on immediately afterwards to reach the town on the following day.|$|E
500|$|The {{sources on}} the origin of the ship's {{propulsion}} machinery disagree. Russian sources say that two sets of steam turbines were ordered on 22 April 1913 from the Franco-Russian Works in Saint Petersburg for the Admiralty-built ships and that the Baltic Works built the turbines for its ships, with some components ordered from abroad. Western sources, however, maintain that Navarins turbines were ordered from AG Vulcan Stettin and that they were seized after {{the start of the war}} and used in the Brummer-class cruisers. Given that the same Russian companies had built the similar, albeit less powerful, turbines for the Gangut-class battleships, it <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> that the Russian sources are correct, and that the components ordered from Germany were incorporated into the German ships.|$|E
500|$|The {{size of the}} Cuthbert Gospel {{places it}} within the Insular {{tradition}} of the [...] "pocket gospels", of which eight Irish examples survive, including the Book of Dimma, Book of Mulling, and Book of Deer, although all the others are or were originally texts of all four gospels, {{with the possible exception}} of a few pages from the Gospel of John enshrined with the Stowe Missal in its cumdach or book-reliquary. [...] There was a tradition of even smaller books, whose use seems to have been often amuletic, and a manuscript of John alone, with a page size of 72 x 56mm, was found in a reliquary at Chartres Cathedral in 1712. [...] It is probably Italian from the 5th or 6th century, and the label it carried in 1712 saying it was a relic of St Leobinus, a bishop of Chartes who died in about 556, may be correct. [...] The other examples are mostly in Greek or the Coptic language and contain a variety of biblical texts, especially psalters. [...] Julian Brown concludes that the three Latin manuscripts of John [...] "seem to attest an early medieval practice of placing a complete Gospel of St. John in a shrine, as a protective amulet; and it <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> to conclude that our manuscript was placed in St. Cuthbert's coffin to protect it".|$|E

500|$|The Abbasid army, {{following}} the reforms of al-Mu'tasim, was a {{smaller and more}} professional fighting force than the caliphal armies of the past. Although it proved effective militarily, it also posed a potential danger to {{the stability of the}} Abbasid regime: drawn from Turks and other peoples from the Caliphate's periphery and the lands beyond, it was alienated from the society of the Caliphate's heartlands, with the result that the soldiers were [...] "entirely reliant on the state not just for cash but for their very survival" [...] (Hugh Kennedy). As a result, any failure by the central government to provide their pay resulted in a military uprising and a political crisis, as had been repeatedly demonstrated during the Anarchy at Samarra. Consequently, ensuring the regular payment of the army became the prime task of the state. According to Hugh Kennedy, based on a treasury document from the time of al-Mu'tadid's accession, [...] "out of the total expenditure of 7915 dinars per day, some 5121 are entirely military, 1943 in areas (like riding animals and stables) which served both military and non-military and only 851 in areas like the bureaucracy and the harem which can be described as truly civilian (though even in this case, the bureaucrats’ main purpose seems to have been to arrange the payment of the army). It <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> to conclude that something over 80 per cent of recorded government expenditure was devoted to maintaining the army." ...|$|E

This turns and runs just south of Victoria, nearly in-line with the SWIF. [...] Seismic tomography studies show a change in seismic velocities across the {{northern end}} of the SWIF, suggesting that this is also part of the Coast Range—Cascade contact.

2500|$|Intrafasciular strain {{showed that}} the muscle was nonuniform, and that the {{architectural}} gear ratio is the highest at the proximal region of the muscle but then decreases towards the distal region. “ It is currently not possible to determine the precise distribution of stress throughout a muscle, but it <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> {{to assume that the}} total (integrated) force at any cross section of the muscle and tendon remains fairly constant along the proximodistal axis. The smaller cross-sectional areas as the muscle thins and becomes tendon will thus result in a higher stress concentration to accommodate the same stress over a smaller area and therefore potentially higher strains if material properties remained constant." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Cochrane Collaboration (2013) {{states that}} the best quality {{evidence}} neither demonstrates a reduction in either cancer specific, nor a reduction in all-cause mortality from screening mammography. When less rigorous trials {{are added to the}} analysis there is a reduction in breast cancer specific mortality of 0.05% (a relative decrease of 15%). Screening results in a 30% increase in rates of over-diagnosis and over-treatment, resulting in the view that {{it is not clear whether}} mammography screening does more good or harm. [...] On their Web site, Cochrane currently concludes that, due to recent improvements in breast cancer treatment, and the risks of false positives from breast cancer screening leading to unnecessary treatment, [...] "it therefore no longer <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> to attend for breast cancer screening" [...] at any age.|$|E

2500|$|Earlier heraldic writers {{attributed}} the lions of England to William the Conqueror, but the earliest {{evidence of the}} association of lions with the English crown is a seal bearing two lions passant, used by the future King John during the lifetime of his father, Henry II, who died in 1189. [...] Since Henry was the son of Geoffrey Plantagenet, it <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> to suppose that the adoption of lions as an heraldic emblem by Henry or his sons might have been inspired by Geoffrey's shield. [...] John's elder brother, Richard the Lionheart, who succeeded his father on the throne, {{is believed to have been}} the first to have borne the arms of three lions passant-guardant, still the arms of England, having earlier used two lions rampant combatant, which arms may also have belonged to his father. [...] Richard is also credited with having originated the English crest of a lion statant (now statant-guardant).|$|E
2500|$|The digressions {{individually}} frustrate {{readers who}} expect a clear purpose. Each digression {{has its own}} topic, and each is an essay on its particular sidelight. In his biography of Swift, Ehrenpreis argued that each digression is an impersonation of a different contemporary author. This is the [...] "persona theory," [...] which holds that the Tale is not one parody, but rather a series of parodies, arising out of chamber performance in the Temple household. Prior to Ehrenpreis, some critics had argued that the narrator of the Tale is a character, just as the narrator of a novel would be. Given the evidence of A. C. Elias about the acrimony of Swift's departure from the Temple household, evidence from Swift's Journal to Stella about how uninvolved in the Temple household Swift had been, {{and the number of}} repeated observations about himself by the Tale's author, it <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> to propose that the digressions reflect a single type of man, if not a particular character.|$|E
2500|$|In 1963, William O'Dwyer, {{a reserve}} U.S. Air Force major, accidentally {{discovered}} photographs of a 1910 Whitehead [...] "Large Albatross"-type biplane aircraft shown at {{rest on the}} ground. He found the photo collection in the attic of a Connecticut house. He and members of his 9315th U.S. Air Force Reserve Squadron were requested by the Connecticut Aeronautical Historical Association (CAHA) to conduct research to try to learn if Whitehead had made powered flights. O'Dwyer continued his research for years and became convinced that Whitehead did fly before the Wright brothers. In a 1981 conversation with O'Dwyer, former CAHA president Harvey Lippincott said, [...] "I cannot {{accept the fact that}} he flew 7 miles, but I can accept the fact that this airplane of his may have flown 100 – 200 feet, 10–15 feet off the ground. This is confirmed by the witnesses that we have interviewed and talked with, and this <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> for {{the state of the art}} in aviation at that time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Determination of {{the western}} {{terminus}} of the Seattle Fault has been problematic, and has implications for the entire {{west side of the}} Puget Lowland. Initially it was not specified, and rather vaguely indicated to be west of Restoration Point (i.e., west of Puget Sound). An early view was that [...] "the Seattle Fault appears to be truncated by the Hood Canal fault ... and does not extend into the Olympic Mountains". This <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> enough, as Hood Canal is a prominent physiographic boundary between the Olympic Mountains and Puget Lowlands, and believed to be the location of a major fault. Subsequent authors were confident enough to trace the fault west of Bremerton to just north of Green Mountain (the northwestern corner of the Blue Hills uplift [...] see [...] "E" [...] on the map [...] a topographically prominent exposure of uplifted basalt) and just short of Hood Canal; but reluctant to map the fault further west as the distinctive aeromagnetic lineament used to locate the Seattle Fault dies out just west of Bremerton.|$|E
2500|$|In {{almost all}} {{cultures}} objects are named using {{one or two}} words equivalent to [...] "kind" [...] (genus) and [...] "particular kind" [...] (species). When made up of two words (a binomial) the name usually consists of a noun (like salt, dog or star) and an adjectival second word that helps describe the first, and therefore makes the name, as a whole, more [...] "specific", for example, lap dog, sea salt, or film star. The meaning of the noun used for a common name may have been lost or forgotten (whelk, elm, lion, shark, pig) but when the common name is extended to two or more words much more is conveyed about the organism's use, appearance or other special properties (sting ray, poison apple, giant stinking hogweed, hammerhead shark). These noun-adjective binomials are just like our own names with a family or surname like Simpson and another adjectival Christian or forename name that specifies which Simpson, say Homer Simpson. It <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> {{to assume that the}} form of scientific names we call binomial nomenclature is derived from this simple and practical way of constructing common names - but with the use of Latin as a universal language.|$|E
2500|$|Discovered between 2003 and 2005, {{networks}} of stone-lined or stone-enclosed drains and conduits, extending at least 1.5 kilometers, demonstrate sophisticated hydraulics. Radiocarbon dating situates {{the system in}} the Late Middle Preclassic period, or as early as 500 BC. Early and later Post-Conquest ethnohistory attests that Soconusco, Suchitepéquez, and Escuintla were important centers {{for the production of}} cacao, a high water-demand plant. The same ethnohistory records very dense populations {{at the time of the}} Conquest and fierce fighting between various caciques for control of cacao in an area where today one finds Mazatenango, Cuyotenango, Zapotitlán, San Antonio, and Samayac, all indicated by ethnohistory to have been significant centers of cacao production and trade, and all clustered closely around the Chocolá site. [...] While such ethnohistoric information cannot be relied on as direct evidence to characterize events and processes from millennia earlier, it <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> to use these data as a guide for what one could look for, including evidence of large-scale exchange, perhaps most plausibly, of obsidian for cacao. If, indeed, archaeological evidence can be found to support intensive cacao cultivation at and around Chocolá, a yet stronger case will be made for the Southern Maya area as crucial to the rise of Maya civilization.|$|E
