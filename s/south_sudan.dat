5|$|<b>South</b> <b>Sudan</b> competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. <b>South</b> <b>Sudan</b> {{had been}} an {{independent}} nation since 2011, but its civil war had delayed its membership with the International Olympic Committee until 2015, making 2016 its first official appearance at the Olympic Games. The country was offered three universality placements in athletics, as no South Sudanese athletes met the Olympic qualifying standards prior to the Games. Three athletes, two men and one woman, competed in three track and field events, but did not win any medals. The sole woman, Margret Rumat Hassan, was given a spot eight days {{prior to the start}} of the Games that had been allotted previously to Mangar Makur Chuot. This change was against the advice of the <b>South</b> <b>Sudan</b> Athletics Federation and was due allegedly to pressure from Samsung, for whom Hassan had appeared in an advertisement. The flagbearer for both the opening and closing ceremony was Guor Marial, a marathon runner who, then unable to represent <b>South</b> <b>Sudan,</b> had competed as an Independent Olympic Athlete in 2012. Five South Sudanese nationals also competed as members of the Refugee Olympic Team.|$|E
