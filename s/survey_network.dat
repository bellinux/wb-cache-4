40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} several approaches {{based on}} ant colony optimization for efficient scheduling the surveying activities of designing satellite <b>surveying</b> <b>networks.</b> These proposed approaches use {{a set of}} agents called ants that cooperate to iteratively construct potential observation schedules. Within the context of satellite <b>surveying,</b> a posi-tioning <b>network</b> {{can be defined as}} a set of points which are coordinated by placing receivers on these point to determine sessions between them. The problem is to search for the best order in which these sessions can be observed to give the best possible schedule. The same problem arise in Mobile Phone <b>Surveying</b> <b>networks.</b> Several case studies have been used to experimentally assess the performance of the proposed approaches in terms of solution quality and computational effort. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{shows the}} {{implementation}} of a software using the language Java, to apply the concepts of optimization of <b>surveying</b> monitoring <b>networks</b> and to propitiate the user the interaction possibility with the program, in way to optimize a two dimensional <b>surveying</b> <b>network</b> according to the analysis of the criteria of precision, in that it should look for the minimum variance for each point of the network and reliability criteria to evaluate the number of redundancy and with this the influence of the blunders in the adjusted parameters. The software is capable to perform the adjustment of the observations using least squares method to a set of horizontal coordinates, distances, azimuths and angular observations. It optimizes through the change of observations of the network, with increment of observations or if it is the case reduction of these. The concept of reliability of a <b>surveying</b> <b>network</b> is related to the capacity that this has to detect blunders such small as possible. And this can be evaluated through the numbers of redundancies. The sum of the partial redundancies of the observations of a <b>surveying</b> <b>network</b> indicates the degree of freedom of the network. Therefore each added redundant observation increases in a unit the sum of the partial redundancies, independent of the observation. In thi...|$|R

In this paper, a very efficient method based {{on the concept of}} the genetic algorithms metaheuristic technique is developed for providing an efficient solution for observing a <b>surveying</b> <b>network</b> using space-based satellites systems. These systems are used to determine the geographical positions of unknown points on and above the earth and its oceans using suitable satellite receiving equipment. When related to satellite technology, a <b>surveying</b> <b>network</b> can be defined as a number of points which are co-ordinated by a series of observation sessions. These sessions are formed by placing receivers on the points of the network. An observation session can be defined as a period of time during which two or more receivers simultaneously record satellite signals. Thus, the schedule of receivers is a sequence of sessions to be observed consecutively. The goal is to select the best order in which these sessions can be organised to give the best possible solution at minimal cost. Several real space-based satellites <b>surveying</b> <b>networks</b> have been used to assess the performance of the proposed technique in terms of the solution quality and computational effort. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|The {{development}} of the echo sounder for sea-floor mapping was refined during World War II. Soon research ships crossing the oceans outlined the mid-ocean ridges, fracture zones, and deep-sea trenches. Because these devices sent out broad-beam sound waves from the sea surface, details of the sea floor shape remained obscured by fuzzy smeared out echoes. Ship navigation was so inaccurate that features smaller than a few kilometers across could not be mapped with any certainty. Spiess’ solution to the resolution and mapping problem was two fold; bring the echo sounder close to the sea floor and locate the device within a seabed <b>survey</b> <b>network.</b>|$|E

50|$|Following the {{establishment}} of NAD27, {{it was noted that}} it produced a discrepancy of about 10 m in latitudes {{in the northern part of}} the northern U.S. state of Michigan, necessitating a regional adjustment for the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. As the <b>survey</b> <b>network</b> was extended further north into Canada, similar discrepancies appeared. The problem proved to be systemic: It had been assumed that the differences between the Clarke spheroid and the actual geoid were negligible, whereas these differences actually introduced significant errors. The relatively small number and large separation of the points used to develop NAD27, the limited computational power available to its designers, and the movement of tectonic plates also led to inconsistencies in NAD27 coordinates.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Total reliability, {{also called}} the average {{redundant}} observation component, is an indicator of a <b>survey</b> <b>network.</b> It summarily shows whether gross errors contained in observations on a <b>survey</b> <b>network</b> may be eliminated or weakened by robust estimation methods. Based on total reliability, the current paper presented the concept of remainder reliability, which essentially showed whether gross errors might be eliminated or weakened by robust estimation. Taking 12 leveling networks with different remainder reliability adjustments as examples, simulation experiments were used to compare 4 frequently used robust estimation methods. The results indicate that when observations simultaneously contain one gross error and if the remainder reliability 30. 0 ≥RRg, robust estimation methods may eliminate or weaken these effects. However, if 40. 0 >RRg, all the four robust estimation methods may effectively eliminate or weaken these effects...|$|E
