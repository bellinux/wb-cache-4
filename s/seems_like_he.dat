500|$|The {{adductor}} injury kept Raonic out {{of competition}} for six weeks, {{during which he}} withdrew from the Delray Beach Open and the Mexican Open, and Canada's Davis Cup clash with France. He returned to action at the Indian Wells Masters, reaching the final against world No. 1 Djokovic {{with a string of}} four victories over top20 opponents: Bernard Tomic, Berdych, Monfils, and David Goffin. In the semifinal victory over Goffin, Raonic's average second serve (112mph) was faster than Goffin's average first serve (110mph). Before the final, Djokovic said: [...] "Milos is probably playing the best tennis that he has ever played. His serve was phenomenal before the start of this season, but it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> has improved even more, especially the second serve. He's going for it more. He's not giving you the same look." [...] Raonic lost a lopsided straight sets match to Djokovic in the final, his third consecutive loss in an ATP 1000 final.|$|E

2500|$|Bassist Jerry Scheff, who backed Orbison in his [...] concert, {{wrote about}} him, [...] "Roy Orbison {{was like an}} opera singer.

60|$|I {{wish you}} would learn of Everett what he would take, over and above a {{discharge}} for all the trouble we have been at, to take his business out of our hands {{and give it to}} somebody else. It is impossible to collect money on that or any other claim here now; and although you know I am not a very petulant man, I declare I am almost out of patience with Mr. Everett's importunity. It <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> not only writes all the letters he can himself, but gets everybody else in Louisville and vicinity to be constantly writing to us about his claim. I have always said that Mr. Everett is a very clever fellow, and I am very sorry he cannot be obliged; but it does seem to me he ought to know we are interested to collect his claim, and therefore would do it if we could.|$|E
6000|$|... "Master Butler.--Sir,--It will be {{pleasure}} {{to you to}} ken, that all I came for is, thanks be to God, weel dune and to the gude end, and that your forbear's letter was right welcome to the Duke of Argile, and that he wrote your name down with a kylevine pen in a leathern book, whereby it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> will do for you either wi' a scule or a kirk; he has enow of baith, as I am assured. And I have seen the queen, which gave me a hussy-case out of her own hand. She had not her crown and skeptre, but they are laid by for her, like the bairns' best claise, to be worn when she needs them. And they are keepit in a tour, whilk is not like the tour of Libberton, nor yet Craigmillar, but mair like to the castell of Edinburgh, if the buildings were taen and set down {{in the midst of}} the Nor'-Loch. Also the Queen was very bounteous, giving me a paper worth fiftie pounds, as I am assured, to pay my expenses here and back agen. Sae, Master Butler, as we were aye neebours' bairns, forby onything else that may hae been spoken between us, I trust you winna skrimp yoursell for what is needfu' for your health, since it signifies not muckle whilk o' us has the siller, if the other wants it. And mind this is no meant to haud ye to onything whilk ye wad rather forget, if ye suld get a charge of a kirk or a scule, as above said. Only I hope it will be a scule, and not a kirk, because of these difficulties anent aiths and patronages, whilk might gang ill down wi' my honest father. Only if ye could compass a harmonious call frae the parish of Skreegh-me-dead, as ye anes had hope of, I trow it wad please him weel; since I hae heard him say, that the root of the matter was mair deeply hafted in that wild muirland parish than in the Canongate of Edinburgh. I wish I had whaten books ye wanted, Mr. Butler, for they hae haill houses of them here, and they are obliged to set sum out in the street, whilk are sald cheap, doubtless, to get them out of the weather. It is a muckle place, and I hae seen sae muckle of it, that my poor head turns round. And ye ken langsyne, I am nae great pen-woman, and it is near eleven o'clock o' the night. I am cumming down in good company, and safe--and I had troubles in gaun up whilk makes me blither of travelling wi' kend folk. My cousin, Mrs. Glass, has a braw house here, but a' thing is sae poisoned wi' snuff, that I am like to be scomfished whiles. But what signifies these things, in comparison of the great deliverance whilk has been vouchsafed to my father's house, in whilk you, as our auld and dear well-wisher, will, I dout not, rejoice and be exceedingly glad. And I am, dear Mr. Butler, your sincere well-wisher in temporal and eternal things, [...] "J. D." ...|$|E

500|$|Webb has {{considered}} himself a solo act since 2001, but admits his continued {{collaboration with the}} band can make it <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> never left, saying [...] "Caedmon’s Call, as it turns out, {{is very much like}} hotel california: you can check out anytime you’d like, but you can never really leave." ...|$|R
50|$|He was {{a legendary}} grapper that Hibito idolized. And <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was {{important}} {{when he met}} Hibito.

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Michael G.

50|$|Although {{from the}} opening scene it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> spends every night willing the woman to appear, this isn’t the case.
