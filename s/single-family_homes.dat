5|$|The {{strong winds}} from Paka left around 1,500buildings {{destroyed}} on the island, of which 1,160 were <b>single-family</b> <b>homes.</b> A further 10,000buildings sustained damage to some degree, with 60% {{of the homes}} on the island reporting major damage. In all, about 5,000people were left homeless due to the typhoon. Additionally, an estimated 30–40% of the public buildings received major damage. Buildings on the island made of reinforced concrete fared well, as opposed to light metal-frame structures, which {{more often than not}} were destroyed. Large tourist hotels near Hagåtña, on which Guam is dependent, received generally minor damage, such as broken windows and damaged power generators.|$|E
5|$|East Lansing is {{very much}} a college town, with 60.2% of the {{population}} between the ages of 15 and 24. President John A. Hannah's push to expand in the 1950s and 1960s resulted in the largest residence hall system in the United States. Around 16,000 students live in MSU's 23 undergraduate halls, one graduate hall, and three apartment villages. Each residence hall has its own hall government, with representatives in the Residence Halls Association. Yet despite the size and extent of on-campus housing, the residence halls are complemented by a variety of housing options. 58% of students live off-campus, mostly in the areas closest to campus, in either apartment buildings, former <b>single-family</b> <b>homes,</b> fraternity and sorority houses, or in a co-op.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{construction}} {{began on}} a 60-home upscale development called Arlington Heights, and {{a grant from}} the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development allowed for the demolition of Westlake Terrace, a sprawling and dilapidated public housing project. Today, the site features a blend of senior housing, rental townhouses and for-sale <b>single-family</b> <b>homes.</b> Low real-estate prices and the efforts of the Youngstown Central Area Improvement Corporation (CIC) have contributed to the purchase of several long-abandoned downtown buildings (many by out-of-town investors) and their restoration and conversion into specialty shops, restaurants, and eventually condominiums. Further, a nonprofit organization called Wick Neighbors is planning a $250 million New Urbanist revitalization of Smoky Hollow, a former ethnic neighborhood that borders the downtown and university campus. The neighborhood will eventually comprise about 400 residential units, university student housing, retail space, and a central park. Construction for the project began in 2006.|$|E

40|$|A {{two-stage}} {{least squares}} model of housing prices is estimated with data collected from 3358 <b>single-family</b> <b>home</b> transactions. The results provide evidence for an optimal marketing period and indicate that a liquidity premium is priced in <b>single-family</b> <b>home</b> sales. Consistent with the hypothesis derived from economic search models, the model shows higher selling prices for houses having longer expected marketing periods. The model also shows a price premium for houses that sell faster than expectations. This effect supports the concept that liquidity is a value-enhancing characteristic.
