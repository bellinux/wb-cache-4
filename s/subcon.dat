25|$|Super Mario Bros. 2 is a 2D side-scrolling {{platform}} game. The {{objective of}} the game is to navigate the player's character through the dream world <b>Subcon</b> and defeat the main antagonist Wart. Before each stage, the player chooses one of four different protagonists to use: Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Princess Toadstool. Unlike the previous game, this game does not have multiplayer. All four characters can run, jump, and climb ladders or vines, but each character possesses a unique strength that causes them to be controlled differently. For example, Luigi can jump the highest; Princess Toadstool can jump the farthest; Toad's strength allows him to pick up items quickly. As opposed to the original Super Mario Bros., which only moved from left to right, players can move either left or right, as well as vertically in waterfall, cloud and cave levels. Unlike other Mario games, the characters cannot defeat enemies by jumping on them; but they can stand on, ride on, and jump on the enemies. Instead, the character picks up and throws objects at the enemies, or throws the enemies away, to defeat them. These objects include vegetables plucked from the ground or other enemies.|$|E

25|$|Using {{standard}} IC {{packaging and}} test facilities (called <b>subcons</b> in the IC industry) gives MEMS oscillators production scalability.

This capacity is shared across many IC companies, so ramping production volumes of specific ICs, or in this case specific MEMS oscillators, is a function of allocating standard production equipment. Conversely, quartz oscillator factories are single-function in nature, so that ramping production requires installing custom equipment, which is more costly and time consuming than allocating standard equipment.|$|R

50|$|Peach first {{appeared}} in Super Mario Bros. where she has been kidnapped by the series' main antagonist, Bowser, many times since. (In at least one game, Toadsworth remarks that she is kidnapped, on average, every week.) In Super Mario Bros. 2, she was a playable character. She, along with Mario, Luigi and Toad were summoned by the inhabitants of <b>Subcon</b> to save their dream land from the evil Wart. Peach's main ability was that she could hover for a limited time after jumping left or right. This skill allows her to easily make jumps over areas larger than other characters could. In Super Mario Bros. 3, the Koopalings use their magic wands to turn the Mushroom Kings into various animals. Hearing of this, Princess Peach asks Mario and Luigi to grab the wands back {{in order for the}} Mushroom Kings to be changed back into their true forms, all while sending them items while they were on their quest and providing them with power-ups after completing each level. She is eventually captured herself and later saved by Mario. In Super Mario World, she, Mario and Luigi were having a vacation in Dinosaur Land when Bowser once again kidnapped her.|$|E

40|$|<b>Subcon</b> Warrior 1. 0 was a {{large-scale}} location based promenade performance work {{produced by the}} renowned physical theatre company Zen Zen Zo. Themed around the experiences and ethical dilemmas inherent within contemporary computer gaming scenarios it utilized a dramatic combination of multimedia scenography and audience-performer choreography to profoundly challenge numerous conventions of contemporary performance. Technologies deployed included augmented reality mediatised sets and locations {{as well as the}} extensive use of wearable, portable and wireless systems. Audiences became central participants within the work’s creative processes and were taken on an immersive journey via numerous sets distributed throughout buildings, their environs and a private house. As multimedia director my role was to work in close collaboration with the directors and players to create visual materials, wearable computing and imaging devices, computer surveillance systems, wide area audio broadcasting and bugging and surveillance solutions. The production was hugely successful selling out every performance of its run and producing strong and vibrant reactions from its diverse audiences. [...] - The immersive multimedia script developed a complex computer gaming scenario that required audiences to engage in physical action, active problem solving and role play, thereby developing a deep physical and emotional connection to the ‘game’ and its characters. Audience groups and performers shared common spaces and scenarios and each were handed a range of problems and ethical dilemmas which they were asked to resolve in limited time periods, ensuring that the work’s outcomes could be dramatically different depending upon any one audience’s will, ability and collective skills.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{benefits}} of several fuzzy inference sys-tem design methodologies and evaluate their characteristics in regard to our trustworthiness and QoS measurement models. Our analysis shows that Mam-dani-Assilian or Larsen type and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang type fuzzy inference methods have their merits in different situations. We propose to equip an autonomous agent which acts {{on behalf of a}} human being with a policy table enabling the agent to dynamically decide which fuzzy inference system it will select during the trustworthiness evaluation process. We argue that in most situations the Mamdani-Assilian or Larsen type fuzzy inference system repre-sents the preferred choice. However, in situations where the fuzzy rulebase is large, the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang type fuzzy inference system should be chosen due to its superior performance characteristics. This way the agent can perform its tasks more efficiently by choosing the appropriate calculation method de-pending on the given circumstances.

Following Ingram [5] we say that f is confluent with respect to H (respectively, weakly confluent with respect to H) provided that for each (resp., some) component, L, of f-l(H), f(L) = H.

40|$|This semi-annual {{technical}} progress report is for Task 4 site evaluation, Task 5 seismic reflection design and acquisition, and Task 6 seismic reflection processing and interpretation on DOE contact number DE-AR 26 - 98 FT 40369. The project had planned one additional deployment to another site other than Savannah River Site (SRS) or DOE Hanford. During this reporting period the project had an ASME peer review. The findings and {{recommendation of the}} review panel, as well at the project team response to comments, are in Appendix A. After the <b>SUBCON</b> midyear review in Albuquerque, NM and the peer review {{it was decided that}} two additional deployments would be performed. The first deployment is to test the feasibility of using non-invasive seismic reflection and AVO analysis as monitoring to assist in determining the effectiveness of Dynamic Underground Stripping (DUS) in removal of DNAPL. Under the rescope of the project, Task 4 would be performed at the Charleston Navy Weapons Station, Charleston, SC and not at the Dynamic Underground Stripping (DUS) project at SRS. The project team had already completed Task 4 at the M-area seepage basin, only a few hundred yards away from the DUS site. Because the geology is the same, Task 4 was not necessary. However, a Vertical Seismic Profile (VSP) was conducted in one well to calibrate the geology to the seismic data. The first deployment to the DUS Site (Tasks 5 and 6) has been completed. Once the steam has been turned off these tasks will be performed again to compare the results to the pre-steam data. The results from the first deployment to the DUS site indicated a seismic amplitude anomaly at the location and depths of the known high concentrations of DNAPL. The deployment to another site with different geologic conditions was supposed to occur during this reporting period. The first site selected was DOE Paducah, Kentucky.

The second deployment is to the Department of Defense (DOD) Charleston Naval Weapons Station Solid Waste Management Unit 12 (SWMU- 12), Charleston, SC to further test the technique to detect high concentrations of DNAPL. The Charleston Naval Weapons Station SWMU- 12 site was selected in consultation with National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) and DOD Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division (NAVFAC) personnel. Based upon the review of existing data and due to the shallow target depth, the project team collected three Vertical Seismic Profiles (VSP) and an experimental P-wave seismic reflection line. After preliminary data analysis of the VSP data and the experimental reflection line data, it was decided to proceed with Task 5 and Task 6. Three high resolution P-wave reflection profiles were collected with two objectives; (1) design the reflection survey to image a target depth of 20 feet below land surface to assist in determining the geologic controls on the DNAPL plume geometry, and (2) apply AVO analysis to the seismic data to locate the zone of high concentration of DNAPL. Based upon the results of the data processing and interpretation of the seismic data, the project team was able to map the channel that is controlling the DNAPL plume geometry. The AVO analysis located a major amplitude anomaly, which was tested using a Geoprobe{trademark} direct push system. The Geoprobe{trademark} was equipped with a membrane interface probe (MIP) that was interfaced with a sorbent trap/gas chromatograph (GC) system. Both the Photo Ionization Detector (PID) and Electron Capture Detector (ECD) on the GC exceeded the maximum measurement values through the anomaly. A well was installed to collect a water sample. The concentration of chlorinated solvents in the water sample was in excess of 500 ppm. Other amplitude anomalies located directly under an asphalt road were also tested. Both the PID and ECD were zero. It appears that editing of poor quality near-offset traces during data processing caused these anomalies. Not having the full range of source to receiver offset traces in those areas resulted in a false anomaly during AVO analysis. This phenomenon was also observed {{at the beginning and end}} of each seismic profile also for the same reason. Based upon the water samples and MIP probes, it appears that surface seismic and AVO analysis were able to detect the area of highest concentration of DNAPL...|$|E
