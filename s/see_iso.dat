50|$|Since the {{endpoints}} {{have the}} same monetary unit (e.g. euro, dollar), they are added up to the total eco-costs without applying a 'subjective' weighting system. This is an advantage of the eco-costs system (<b>see</b> also <b>ISO</b> 14044 section 4.4.3.4 and 4.4.5).

50|$|Usability {{engineers}} sometimes work {{to shape}} an interface {{such that it}} adheres to accepted operational definitions of user requirements documentation. For example, the International Organisation for Standardisation-approved definitions (<b>see</b> e.g., <b>ISO</b> 9241 part 11) usability are held {{by some to be}} a context-, efficiency, and satisfaction with which specific users should be able to perform tasks. Advocates of this approach engage in task analysis, then prototype interface design, and usability testing on those designs. On the basis of such tests, the technology is potentially re-designed if necessary.|$|R

40|$|We have peformed {{point source}} {{extraction}} from a Spitzer/MIPS {{survey of the}} largest galaxy in the Local Group, M 31.

These sources have typical luminosities of 103 - 104 solar, which are consistent with asymptotic giant branch and red supergiant stars with circumstellar envelopes. Our catalog is cross-correlated with 2 MASS and with a recently published catalog of Long Period Variable stars. We interpret the distribution of 24 micron point sources {{in the context of}} galactic structure, identifying sources in the nucleus/bulge, arms/rings, and interarm regions. The point sources are superposed on newly revealed structures in diffuse emission emanating from the bulge and nuclear region {{as well as from the}} star forming rings <b>seen</b> by <b>ISO</b> and IRAS...|$|R
