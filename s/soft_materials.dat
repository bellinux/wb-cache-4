5|$|All nuthatches nest in cavities; {{except for}} the two species of rock nuthatches, all use tree holes, making a simple cup lined with <b>soft</b> <b>materials</b> on which to rest eggs. In some species the lining {{consists}} of small woody objects such as bark flakes and seed husks, while in others it includes the moss, grass, hair and feathers typical of passerine birds.|$|E
5|$|The American robin {{is active}} mostly {{during the day}} and assembles in large flocks at night. Its diet {{consists}} of invertebrates (such as beetle grubs, earthworms, and caterpillars), fruits, and berries. It is one of the earliest bird species to lay eggs, beginning to breed shortly after returning to its summer range from its winter range. Its nest consists of long coarse grass, twigs, paper, and feathers, and is smeared with mud and often cushioned with grass or other <b>soft</b> <b>materials.</b> It {{is one of the first}} birds to sing at dawn, and its song consists of several discrete units that are repeated.|$|E
5|$|The demo for Mirror's Edge, {{consisting}} of the game's prologue chapter, was released via the PlayStation Store on October 30, 2008, followed by the Xbox LIVE Marketplace on October 31. On November 7, 2008, DICE announced that Mirror's Edge had achieved gold status, and PS3 and Xbox 360 versions would be shipping to retailers on November 13. On January 16, 2009, a Microsoft Windows version of the game was released. The PC version features support for Nvidia's PhysX, adding detail and physics to glass, smoke and <b>soft</b> <b>materials.</b> The game includes the SecuROM v7.x (activation based) DRM software, unless bought from Steam.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of the saxaul sparrow's behaviour. Often hidden in foliage, it forages in trees and on the ground. It feeds mostly on seeds, as well as insects while {{breeding}} and as a nestling. When not breeding it forms wandering flocks, but it is less social than other sparrows while breeding, often nesting in isolated pairs. Nests are round bundles of dry plant material lined with <b>soft</b> <b>materials</b> such as feathers. They are built in holes in tree cavities, earth banks, rocky slopes, and within man-made structures or the nests of birds of prey. Two clutches {{of five or six}} eggs are typically laid in a season. Both parents construct the nest and care for their eggs and young.|$|E
5|$|The nest {{is usually}} domed, {{though it may}} lack a roof in {{enclosed}} sites. It has an outer layer of stems and roots, a middle layer of dead grass and leaves, and a lining of feathers, {{as well as of}} paper and other <b>soft</b> <b>materials.</b> Nests typically have external dimensions of 20 × 30cm (8 × 12in), but their size varies greatly. The building of the nest is initiated by the unmated male while displaying to females. The female assists in building, but is less active than the male. Some nest building occurs throughout the year, especially after moult in autumn. In colder areas house sparrows build specially created roost nests, or roost in street lights, to avoid losing heat during the winter. House sparrows do not hold territories, but they defend their nests aggressively against intruders of the same sex.|$|E

25|$|The detective gag, or over-the-mouth gag (sometimes {{abbreviated}} to OTM), {{is often described}} in fiction (particularly crime serials) as preventing the subject from speaking {{through the use of}} <b>soft</b> <b>materials</b> such as scarves or bandannas. The long scarf or bandanna is pulled over the subject's mouth and tied at the back of his/her head. In practice, it does not silence the subject very effectively. Images of OTM gags, usually applied on women, had been prevalent since the film serials of the early 1900s. For this reason, the OTM gag is associated with the typical damsel in distress.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{forms of}} the letters in antiquity are {{majuscule}} forms. Besides the upright, straight inscriptional forms (capitals) found in stone carvings or incised pottery, more fluent writing styles adapted for handwriting on <b>soft</b> <b>materials</b> were also developed during antiquity. Such handwriting has been preserved especially from papyrus manuscripts in Egypt since the Hellenistic period. Ancient handwriting developed two distinct styles: uncial writing, with carefully drawn, rounded block letters of about equal size, used as a book hand for carefully produced literary and religious manuscripts, and cursive writing, used for everyday purposes. The cursive forms approached the style of lowercase letter forms, with ascenders and descenders, {{as well as many}} connecting lines and ligatures between letters.|$|E
25|$|The professorial Talar can be {{described}} as a long black gown with wide sleeves, often with lapels in faculty colour, while deans wear a Talar completely in faculty colour. Rectors typically have a distinguished, more elaborate Talar, e.g., made of velvet, coloured in red, or with gold embroidery. At some universities, the rector additionally wears a chain of office and, at some occasions, carries a scepter. The cap that accompanies the Talar is called Barett. As is the case with the Talar, which type of cap is used varies by university as well. Historically, caps made of <b>soft</b> <b>materials</b> rather than the square academic cap are common. The colour of the Barett matches the Talar.|$|E

500|$|The nest is most {{commonly}} located [...] {{above the ground}} in a dense bush or in a fork between two tree branches, and is built by the female alone. The outer foundation consists of long coarse grass, twigs, paper, and feathers. This is lined with smeared mud and cushioned with fine grass or other <b>soft</b> <b>materials.</b> A new nest is built for each brood, and in northern areas the first clutch is usually placed in an evergreen tree or shrub while later broods are placed in deciduous trees. The American robin does not shy away from nesting close to human habitation and will frequently construct nests under eaves or awnings on human homes when such locations provide adequate shelter. Robins are not cavity nesters, and so will generally not use a bird house, but will take advantage of artificial nesting platforms.|$|E
500|$|Little {{is known}} about the huia's reproduction, as only two eggs and four nests were ever described. The only known huia egg to still exist is in the {{collection}} of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. [...] The breeding season for mating, building nests, laying eggs and raising young is thought to have been late spring (October–November). It is thought they nested solitarily; pairs are said to have been territorial and the birds would remain on their territories for life. Huia appear to have raised just one brood per season; the number of eggs in a clutch is variously described as being 3–5,4,2–4 and 1–4. These eggs were greyish with purple and brown speckles, and measured [...] Incubation was mostly by the female, though there is evidence that the male also had a small role, as rubbed-bare brooding patches that were smaller than those of females were discovered on some males in November. The incubation period is unknown. Eggshells were apparently removed from the nest by adults. The brood size was usually one or two, though there was the odd record of up to three chicks in a single nest. Nests were constructed in varying places: in dead trees, the crooks of large branches, tree hollows, on branches, or [...] "on or near the ground", and some nests were covered with hanging vegetation or vines. The nest itself was a large saucer-shaped structure, up to 350mm in diameter and 70mm deep, with thick walls of dry grass, leaves and [...] "withered stems of herbaceous plants". A central small, shallow cup of <b>soft</b> <b>materials</b> such as grass and fine twigs cushioned and insulated the eggs. [...] After hatching, young remained in the family group and were fed by the adults for three months, by which time they appeared adult.|$|E

50|$|Flying Null {{technology}} uses {{a series}} of passive magnetic structures, much like the lines used in conventional barcodes. These structures are made of <b>soft</b> magnetic <b>material.</b> The interrogator contains two permanent magnets with like poles. The resulting magnetic field has a null volume in the centre. Additionally, interrogating radiation is used. The magnetic field created by the interrogator is such that it drives the <b>soft</b> <b>material</b> to saturation except when {{it is at the}} null volume. When in the null volume the soft magnet interacts with the interrogating radiation thus giving away the position of the <b>soft</b> <b>material.</b> Spatial resolution of more than 50 μm may be attained.|$|R
