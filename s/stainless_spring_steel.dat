50|$|Wire {{has many}} uses. It forms the raw {{material}} of many important manufacturers, such as the wire netting industry, engineered springs, wire-cloth making and wire rope spinning, in which it occupies a place analogous to a textile fiber. Wire-cloth of all degrees of strength and fineness of mesh is used for sifting and screening machinery, for draining paper pulp, for window screens, and for many other purposes. Vast quantities of aluminium, copper, nickel and steel wire are employed for telephone and data cables, and as conductors in electric power transmission, and heating. It is in no less demand for fencing, and much is consumed {{in the construction of}} suspension bridges, and cages, etc. In the manufacture of stringed musical instruments and scientific instruments, wire is again largely used. Carbon and <b>stainless</b> <b>spring</b> <b>steel</b> wire have significant applications in engineered springs for critical automotive or industrial manufactured parts/components. Pin and hairpin making; the needle and fish-hook industries; nail, peg, and rivet making; and carding machinery consume large amounts of wire as feedstock.|$|E
40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the development and}} {{construction of a new}} patented doctor blade. A doctor blade is used when creping soft paper from a large rotating Yankee cylinder. At the current state the doctor blade are in use for four to six hours before it needs to be switch due to wearing, stopping the production of soft paper. The new idea is to have a very long and small blade that will slide into a fixed blade and be continuously pulled when creping paper. The company CS Production had a concept of the fixed blade but wanted to further develop it since the blade was too wide.   Measurements where done with the old blade and with the old testing device to measure the pull force required to pull the blade. New concepts where made by the method of brainstorming and evaluated with an elimination matrix. Rivet joints where selected as the joining technique for the new design. The new concept contains one dominant blade that smaller parts were assembled to form the final blade. The material selected for the dominant blade and the section blade was a cold rolled <b>stainless</b> <b>spring</b> <b>steel</b> strip and for the middle disc the material was aluminum bronze string casted. Test on the pull force required where done with the new doctor blade in the new test rig.  FEM simulation where done on {{a small part of the}} blade to see where stresses are occurring in the blade. The FEM result showed that no stresses where on the middle discs, rivets or section blades. This is not reliable results because the small doctor blade is pushing down onto the middle discs and stresses should be occurring on the discs.  Further testing is needed to see if the blade can withstand the forces applied to it...|$|E

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that other {{researchers}} have found that steel loss calculated using Faraday’s Law tends to overestimate the actual steel loss (Aiello 1996). When the specimens are subjected to corrosion, the specimens will expand due to the formation of the corrosion products which are expansive in nature. To measure the circumferential expansion of each column, a specially fabricated mechanical expansion collar was placed at mid-height of each column. Each collar was made from 12  mm wide stainless steel sheets and included a small opening held closed by two <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>springs.</b> A micrometer was used to measure the change in the opening size to the nearest one-hundredth of a millimeter, to determine the circumferential expansion of the column at mid-height.|$|R

30|$|In Version 3 (Fig.  3 c), {{a number}} of {{improvements}} were applied. Two conical connections at the two ends of the column were designed to replace the clamp-connections used in Version 2. The two caps and body of the column were connected by the two conical joints (vaseline should be used at the connect contact {{in order to facilitate}} the disassembling step). The connection was strengthened by <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>springs</b> (or rubber bands) and hooks surrounding four sides of the column. This design also improved the manipulation of packing material in the column, making it quicker and easier to use. The leakage problem was mostly prevented by the conical joint. After several tests, the advantages of this version were compared to the previous versions and noted in terms of its faster manufacture, easier manipulating and packing, and lower production cost. Experiencing the trials, however, it was observed that the lower conical cap was not really necessary and, as a consequence, further refinements were made resulting in the final version (Version 4).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{elaborate}} design optimization technique of coil spring sets with genetic algorithm. Attention is focused on reducing the weight and stresses keeping into considerations the various critical points. The spring is designed to operate with tension load, so the spring stretches as the load is applied to it. The aim of the present work is to design the extension spring for various material like steel, stainless steel, music wire (High carbon steel), oil Tempered (High carbon steel) for same loading condition, since each material has different compositions and properties. Optimization of spring helps in selecting most appropriate and cost effective material for spring. On applying the GA, the optimum parameter of spring have been obtained, which contribute towards achieving the minimum weight. A reduction of 7 % weight is achieved when <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>spring</b> is replaced with other spring stated here, under identical condition of design parameters and optimization.

40|$|The {{goals of}} this {{research}} project are to increase the methane conversion and improve the hydrocarbon production. For methane reforming, we achieved a conversion of up to 43 % by adjusting the reaction conditions. Ruthenium clusters are effective catalysts but the selectivity to hydrocarbons needs to be improved. In evaluating the effect of cluster size for mononuclear, tetranuclear, and hexanuclear ruthenium complexes {{we found that the}} tetraruthenium cluster was by far the most effective catalyst. We began to study the mixed metal catalysts by synthesizing a FeRu{sub 3 } cluster. We plan to vary the ratio of Fe to Ru by synthesizing Fe{sub 2 }Ru{sub 2 } and Fe{sub 3 }Ru clusters. The type of the support also {{plays an important role in}} methane reforming. We briefly tested a basic support, magnesia, in addition to the acidic supports tested previously (alumina, 5 A molecular sieve, and Y-zeolite). The results are promising. We will continue to investigate the role of the support. The effectiveness of using a hydrogen removal membrane is still in question. We purchased a new Pd/Ag membrane tube inside which a <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>spring</b> is inserted. The <b>steel</b> <b>spring</b> will increase the strength of the otherwise fragile tube and it will support the tube during bending. We will build a new reactor using this membrane tube...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} simvastatin on relapse of tooth movement in rats using microtomography (micro CT), {{as well as the}} correlation of bone density with the orthodontic relapse. METHODS: Twenty-five adult male Wistar rats, divided into two groups, had <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>springs</b> installed on left maxillary first molar. The molars were moved for 18 days, and after removing the springs, were applied by oral gavage, 5 mg/kg of simvastatin in the experimental group for 20 days. Tooth relapse was assessed with a micro CT scanner, and the images chosen through the Data Viewer software 1. 5. 0. 0 had their measurement guides made and checked by the software Image ProR plus 5. 1, and compared by Mann-Whitney test. After rats were sacrificed, bone mineral density was evaluated by micro CT through the software CT Analyzer 1. 13 and compared by independent T-test, as well as by Spearman correlation test. RESULTS: Relapse and bone mineral density (BMD) was lower in the experimental group than in the control group, however without a statistically significant difference.

50|$|Open heel fins are {{secured to}} the foot by a strap which passes {{around the back of}} the ankle. These are usually elastic and may be adjustable. Early fins used rubber straps {{connected}} to the fin by a wire buckle, and were not readily adjustable. Later versions incorporated swivels, buckles, quick release connectors and adjustable tension, but the increased complexity and decreased reliability, and tendency of the loose strap ends to hook on things triggered a return by some manufacturers and aftermarket accessory manufacturers to simpler systems. These include <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>spring</b> straps and bungee straps, which once set up, are not adjustable, and which reduce the number of potential failure points and places where the fin can snag on obstructions like net, line and seaweed. Some heel straps have a loop for better grip with wet hands or gloves.Some fins designed for surf use have integral straps which can neither be replaced nor adjusted, but are simple and have no projections which can snag or scratch the swimmer's legs. They are much like full foot pocket fins without the back part of the sole, but do not trap as much sand when used in the surf.|$|R

These contactors {{can be used}} as replacement for vertical wafer probes as well as test sockets used in the final test. The contactor pin consists of a plunger section made of beryllium copper and a plated helical <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>spring</b> wire. It is 5 mm in uncompressed total length, including the plunger and the spring. The overall diameter of the spring wire section was 0. 51 mm. The design of the contactor is much simpler and more scalable than that of traditional spring pins called Pogo pins used in package tests. A test socket containing 36 contactor pins was constructed for tests and measurements. The experimental characterization shows $-$ 1 -dB bandwidth of 3. 73 GHz for 0. 8 -mm pitch, measured by the direct contact method. This experimental result correlates well with the simulated results. The rise time was 82 ps as measured by TDR, and the propagation delay was 23 ps. The electrical conduction path is through the pin and the spring, making it a reliable contact. However, the electrical path is known to be through the barrel, not the spring for the regular spring pins...|$|R

The detergents Triton X- 100, Emulphogene BC- 720, and deoxycholate {{were used to}} removed the toxic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) portion of the serotype antigen. The LPS was most preferentially solubilized by Emulphogene. Guinea pigs were immunized {{with one or two}} doses of vaccine given intramuscularly without adjuvants and the antibody response quantitated by an enzyme- linked immunosorbant assay. Immunization with graded doses of vaccine between 25 to 200 microgram protein indicated a wide range of effective dosage and that a two-dose immunization schedule was superior to a single immunization. The vaccines elicited peak mean serum antibody levels of approximately 30 microgram/ml with bactericidal titers of 1 : 1, 600 - 1 : 6, 400. The peak antibody levels occurred 5 - 6 wk after immunization and persisted above preimmune levels for several months. To evaluate the protective effects of immunization, <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>springs</b> were implanted subcutaneously into the guinea pigs. The resulting chambers, in unimmunized animals, could be infected with less than 100 type 2 organisms. A single 25 - 50 microgram dose of vaccine protected 50 % of animals from challenge by 5 X 10 (5) type 2 meningococci, and as little as 1 microgram vaccine significantly reduced the severity of infection.

40|$|Introduction: Bone {{turn over}} in females is {{influenced}} by steroid hormones such as progesterone. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effects of Progesterone on experimental tooth movement in rabbits. Material and Methods: Twenty four pre-pubertal female albino rabbits were randomly assigned into three equal groups. In the first group (LTG), rabbits received daily injection of 5 mg intramuscular progesterone for 9 weeks. In the second group (STG), rabbits received the same injections for the last 3 weeks of the experiment and in the third or control group (CG), the animals did not receive any progesterone. At the end of the 6 th week, in all groups, two brackets were bonded to the incisor teeth in order to apply 50 gr distal force to these teeth via a <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>springs.</b> Measurements were conducted at the end of weeks 7, 8, and 9 to calculate the distance between the incisors. The ANOVA and Tukey tests were used to compare the three groups.
