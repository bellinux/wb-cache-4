40|$|Cauda equina {{syndrome}} (CES) {{is characterized}} by low back pain, sciatica, lower limb motor weakness and sensory deficits, <b>saddle</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> bowel and bladder dysfunction and occasionally paraplegia. The syndrome is classified according to onset: rapid or slow. Rapid onset CES, because of its characteristic presentation is easily recognized. The slow, chronic progression and varying presenting {{signs and symptoms of}} slow onset CES often mimic mechanical low back pain and makes the diagnosis difficult in its early stages. The case of a 23 -year-old female with slow onset cauda equina is presented to illustrate this. A discussion of lumbar spine anatomy {{as it relates to the}} clinical presentation of cauda equina syndrome and the influence of associated degenerative factors follows. The most common presenting signs and symptoms are reviewed with special emphasis on those which can help diagnose CES in its early stages. Patients prognosis following surgical decompression is highlighted...|$|E
40|$|A 36 -year-old man {{presented}} with a 14 -year history of low backache. In addition, numbness and weakness in the right leg was noted during the preceding three years, with development of radicular pain involving the left leg in the previous six months. The patient admitted to having impotence for one year. Physical examination revealed <b>saddle</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> and reduced sensation in the L 4, L 5 and S 1 dermatomes bilaterally. His blood pressure was 130 / 80 mmHg and his heart rate was 80 /min. Radiographs of the lumbar spine were performed (Figs. 1 a-b), followed by magnetic resonance (MR) scans (Figs. 2 a-b). What do these show? What is the diagnosis? Fig. 2 b Gadolinium- enhanced sagittal T 1 -W MR image of the lumbar spine. Fig. 1 a Frontal radiograph of the lumbar spine.

40|$|Sacral chordomas are rare, slow-growing tumours {{that are}} {{amenable}} to surgery, but unfortunately often diagnosed late. The aim {{of the study was}} to identify presenting symptoms, which may aid diagnosis and reduce the treatment time. Forty-four patients were identified with sacral chordoma between 1989 and 2006. Clinical and pathological records were reviewed retrospectively to elicit the symptoms recorded prior to diagnosis, duration of symptoms, surgical treatment, size of tumour and survival. Eleven patients were excluded, leaving 33 patients in the study group. Thirty-one patients had chordomas arising from the sacrum and two patients from the coccyx. The mean duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis was 120  weeks (2. 3  years), with a median of length of 104  weeks (two years) and range of 26 to 416  weeks (0. 5 to eight years). The mean maximum tumour size at resection was 8. 3  cm, with a mean volume of 614  cm 3 (range 9 – 2, 113  cm 3). Pain, typically dull and worse with sitting, was the most common presenting symptom in 85 % of patients. The classic symptoms of cauda equina (<b>saddle</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> bladder or bowel dysfunction) occurred in 70 % patients (23 patients). Sacral chordoma should be considered in cases of back pain with coccydynia, especially with neurological symptoms...|$|E
40|$|A 65 -year-old man was {{admitted}} with radiating pain in right leg and <b>saddle</b> type <b>anaesthesia</b> with urination, defecation and ejaculation problems. Spinal MRI revealed a disc fragment that hugely extruded towards central spinal channel with marked cranial migration at L 4 - 5 level on the T 2 weighted sagittal image. It alsodemonstrated abrupt loss of {{continuity of the}} posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL). Then, he was taken for surgery. After a durotomy was performed, two pieces of cartilagenous tissue were removed en bloc. Three months later, his urination, defecation, ejaculation returned to nearly normal; and postoperative MRI revealed that operative site was clean {{and there was no}} residual disc material. We would like to emphasis on two points of MR findings about which increase the suspicious for intradural extension of these disc fragments. The first point is abrupt loss of continuity of the posterior longitudinal ligament. The second point is a sharp beak-like appearance on T 2 weighted axial imaging. Prognosis is related to  complete removal of the herniated material, cleaning of the intervertebral space, duration and characterization of the symptomatology...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Regional (<b>saddle</b> block) <b>anaesthesia</b> in {{anorectal}} {{and some}} urological and gynaecological procedures provides suitable {{conditions for the}} surgeon due to the sufficiency of analgesia and decreases {{the side effects of}} spinal anaesthesia. In this study, duration of the painless period and complications after saddle block with Meperidine (pethidine) were assessed in perineal surgeries. Materials and Methods:This study was conducted on 50 cases observed by the American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status class I, II(21 - 70 years old patients), who were scheduled to undergo anorectal surgery. All patients received 500 ml of crystalloid solution. The saddle block was done with 30 mg pethidine and sub arachnoid puncture was performed with the patient in the sitting position. Vital signs were recorded 5 minutes before the block and at the 5 th, 10 th, 15 th and 60 th minutes after the block. The severity of postoperative pain was assessed by a visual analog scale. The data was analyzed by appropriate descriptive statistical methods. Results: The mean period of analgesia was more than 24 hours in 18 % of the patients. The VAS pain score showed no pain in 78 % of the patients. Sixteen percent of the patients complained of itching in the nose, face and chest, ten minutes after injection and it continued for about two hours. Conclusions: This study showed that the haemodynamic stability and quality of postoperative analgesia with pethidine was good, without any need for additional analgesia. We suggested using low dosage pethidine (30 mg) as saddle block for perineal and anorectal surgeries...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To compare general practitioners' {{reported}} {{management of}} acute back pain with “evidence based” guidelines for its management. Design: Confidential postal questionnaire. Setting: One health {{district in the}} South and West region. Subjects: 236 general practitioners; 166 (70 %) responded. Outcome measures: Examination routinely performed, “danger” symptoms and signs warranting urgent referral, advice given, and satisfaction with management. Results: A minority of general practitioners do not examine reflexes routinely (27 %, 95 % confidence interval 20 % to 34 %), and a majority do not examine routinely for muscle weakness or sensation. Although most would refer patients with danger signs, some would not seek urgent advice for <b>saddle</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> (6 %, 3 % to 11 %), extensor plantar response (45 %, 37 % to 53 %), or neurological signs at multiple levels (15 %, 10 % to 21 %). A minority do not give advice about back exercises (42 %, 34 % to 49 %), fitness (34 %, 26 % to 41 %), or everyday activities. A minority performed manipulation (20 %) or acupuncture (6 %). One third rated their satisfaction with management of back pain as 4 out of 10 or less. Conclusions: The management of back pain by general practitioners does not match the guidelines, {{but there is little}} evidence from general practice for many of the recommendations, including routine examination, activity modification, educational advice, and back exercises. General practitioners need to be more aware of danger symptoms and of the benefits of early mobilisation and possibly of manipulation for persisting symptoms. Guidelines should reference each recommendation and discuss study methodology and the setting of evidence...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In renal transplantation, {{there is}} end-to-side {{anastomosis}} of renal artery to {{external iliac artery}} and end-to-end anastomosis of renal artery to internal iliac artery. The end-to-end internal iliac artery anastomosis {{can be associated with}} complications due to compromised distal vascular supply to limbs and penile erectile tissue. A method of end-to-side anastomosis can overcome them. Till date, there is no case series or trial that has studied the effect of end-to-side anastomosis. This study is aimed at comparing the outcome of end-to-side and end-to-end anastomosis, so as to evaluate the efficacy of end-to-side technique. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 renal transplant recipients were taken, with internal iliac artery anastomosis, and were divided into two groups, 20 patients with end-to-end and 20 patients with end-to-side anastomosis. The cold ischemia time, arterial anastomosis time, post-operative bleeding and urine leak, claudication, saddle anesthesia and erectile dysfunction, and follow-up recipient creatinine and eGFR and Doppler to look for graft renal artery patency (at 6 months post-transplant) were compared between the two groups. Results: The intraoperative cold ischemia time was slightly more in the group with end-to-end anastomosis, but it was statistically significant (P = 0. 22). The arterial anastomosis time was comparable in both the groups (P = 0. 65). In the end-to-end group, 15 %, 20 % and 15 % patients had post-operative <b>saddle</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> claudication and mild-to-moderate erectile dysfunction, which were absent in the end-to-side group. On follow-up, the mean recipient serum creatinine and eGFR were comparable in the two groups. Also, the graft renal artery patency on Doppler was comparable. Conclusion: The end-to-side technique can be definitely applied for renal transplantation, with some advantages over end-to-end technique, and without compromising efficacy...|$|E
40|$|Midline {{prolapse}} ofa disc causing compression ofthe {{cauda equina}} is rare but needs urgent diagnosis and surgical treatment. The onset ofbladder and rectal paralysis with <b>saddle</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> {{should be viewed}} with a high index of suspicion in a patient with backache and sciatica. Eight cases were seen {{over a period of}} five years, and they fell into three clinical groups. Group I patients presented with a sudden onset without any previous symptoms related to the back. Group II patients had a history of recurrent episodes of backache and sciatica, the latest episode resulting in involvement of the cauda equina. The Group III patient was indistinguishable from one with a tumour as he presented with backache and sciatica slowly progressing to paralysis ofthe cauda equina. The prolapse was at the disc between LS and 51 vertebrae in 50 per cent of the patients, most of whom did not have any limitation of straight leg raising. Urgent myelography and equally urgent removal of the disc within two weeks of the onset of the symptoms resulted in almost complete motor and bladder recovery within five months after the operation in most cases. However, recovery of sensation and sexual function was incomplete even four years after the operation. Involvement of the cauda equina with bladder and rectal paralysis due to a prolapsed lumbar intervertebral disc is of rare occurrence but requires urgent surgical treatment. If decompression is delayed, prognosis for the recovery of bladder and rectal functions is poor. This paper is a review of eight cases of compression of the cauda equina due to a prolapsed lumbar intervertebral disc, and its aim is to highlight the presenting features of this condition and stress the need for urgent treatment...|$|E
40|$|Objective The {{cauda equina}} syndrome, {{caused by an}} {{impairment}} of the nerve roots of the cauda equina, is a rare and often misdiagnosed condition consisting of different neurological symptoms. The most common cause is the lumbar disc herniation and requires urgent decompression. The best timing for surgery hasn´t been defined yet; most authors prefer emergency decompression, but some also found improvement of neurological function after 48 h. It´s still controversial which parameters predict the outcome. By reviewing the literature and analysing own medical records we evaluated {{the outcome of the}} disease depending on the time period to surgery and the prognostic values of single parameters. For a semiquantitative pre- and postoperative comparison we established the Berlin CES score. Methods We performed a retrospective study by reviewing data of 60 patients who were treated with the diagnosis „incomplete cauda syndrome“ or „complete cauda syndrome“ at the Unfallkrankenhaus Berlin between 2000 and 2013. Analysed parameters were: age, sex, duration of symptoms, timing between diagnosis and imaging respectively surgery; pre- and postoperatively pain, motoric deficites, reflex alterations, urinary and bowl disfunctions, reduced anal wink, <b>saddle</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> genital or perianal sensations and residual urine. Initially patients were devided into 4 groups as performed by Shi at al. [1]. The semiquantitative assessment of the neurological outcome was performed by application of the Berlin CES score. Literature was reviewed in Pubmed. Results We showed statistic correlations between a high preoperatively Berlin CES score and postoperative existence of perianal (p< 0, 001) and genital (p= 0, 001) sensations as well as a reduced rectal tone (p= 0, 0047). There was no significant interference of bladder or bowl function; we couldn´t identify single parameters which could predict the outcome of the disease reliably. Concerning the time between diagnosis and surgery, both patients operated within 24 h and after 48 h could benefit from the intervention. Patients identified with a complete cauda syndrome showed improvement of the neurological function post surgery. Conclusion Due to the rare existence of the cauda syndrome we couldn´t find any relevant statistic correlation that predicted the outcome reliably. Surgery should also be considered on patients with a longer duration of symptoms or a complete cauda syndrome as the best timing for surgery still remains unclear. An urgent treatment might be helpful to prevent progression of the disease. For that matter it becomes more important to inform patients at risk and attending physicians. Implementation of structured questionaries might be useful...|$|E
