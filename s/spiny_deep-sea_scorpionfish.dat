50|$|Setarchidae, the <b>deep-sea</b> bristly <b>scorpionfishes,</b> is a {{small family}} of deep-sea scorpaeniform fishes. They are small marine fishes, growing up to 25 cm, and are found in {{tropical}} and subtropical waters throughout the world.|$|R
50|$|Scorpaenopsella armata is {{a species}} of <b>deep-sea</b> bristly <b>scorpionfish</b> known only from the Pacific Ocean around the Philippines where it occurs at a depth 216 m. This species may be a junior synonym {{of one of its}} congeners.|$|R
50|$|The <b>deep-sea</b> <b>spiny</b> eels are a family, Notacanthidae, of fishes found {{worldwide}} below 125 m, and {{as deep as}} 3500 m. The earliest known spiny eel is Pronotacanthus sahelalmae, {{from the}} Santonian {{of what is now}} Lebanon.|$|R
50|$|The spiny-back eel, Notacanthus sexspinis, is a <b>deep-sea</b> <b>spiny</b> eel of {{the genus}} Notacanthus, found in all the Southern Hemisphere oceans, at depths between 500 and 1000 m. The length of this fish is up to 60 cm.|$|R
50|$|Halosaurs are eel-shaped fishes {{found only}} at great ocean depths. As the family Halosauridae, halosaurs {{are one of}} two {{families}} within the order Notacanthiformes; the other being the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>spiny</b> eels, Notacanthidae. Halosaurs {{are thought to have}} a worldwide distribution, with some 17 species in three genera represented. Only a handful of specimens have been observed alive, all in chance encounters with Remotely operated underwater vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Although {{not true}} eels, these fish {{do have a}} similar leptocephalus larval form. However, while the larvae of true eels are about 5-10% {{of the length of}} the adult, those of <b>deep-sea</b> <b>spiny</b> eels can grow {{considerably}} larger than the adult, and shrink when they develop into their final form. Thus, while adults range from 20 cm to 1.2 m in length, larvae of up to 1.8 m have been recorded.|$|R
5000|$|The snub-nosed spiny eel, Notacanthus chemnitzii, is {{a member}} of the family Notacanthidae, the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>spiny</b> eels, which are not true eels (Anguilliformes). The snub-nosed spiny eel exists in waters all over the world, except in the tropics, ranging in color from light tan to bluish grey in small ones to dark brown in large ones. [...] Its primary food is sea anemones. [...] The eel usually lives in deep waters, mostly more than 200 m below the surface.|$|R
40|$|Taiwanese waters is {{reported}} for the first time. One species is recognized, namely Puerulus angulatus (Bate, 1888). This <b>deep-sea</b> <b>spiny</b> lobster is rather rare and is caught off the north-eastern coast at the depth of 180 - 350 m together with Metanephrops lobsters by "baby " shrimp trawlers. A brief description and color illustration of this species are provided for its identification. The morphological differences between the sexes in this lobster is also discussed. Key words: New record, Palinuridae, Puerulus, Taiwan. 丄 he record of spiny lobsters of the Family Palinuridae in Taiwan has been two genera and nine species by Ho and Yu (1979). During {{the last few years}} of specimen collection for the Taiwanese decapod crustaceans survey, several specimens of another spiny lobster species were obtained at fish markets. This species belongs to the primitive lobster genus Puerulus Ortmann, 1897 (George & Main 1967). It differs from other spiny lobsters by having a prismatic carapace, a rather short antennulae, and with the supra-orbital horns far apart and almost situated laterally (see Holthuis 1946). The similarity of these characteristics to the young stages of other palinurids earns this genus the name Puerulus. Four extant species of this genus are known at present (see Berry 1969) and all are from Indo-West-Pacific. However, all of them are rather rare and therefore of almost no economic importance (Williams 1986). The record of Puerulus lobsters in Taiwan makes up the Taiwanese spiny lobsters to three genera and 10 species. Our specimens collected to date are all identified as Puerulus angulatus (Bate, 1888). The taxonomic status of this species is rather confusing in the literatur...|$|R
