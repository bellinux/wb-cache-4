5|$|A mid-20th-century report {{estimated}} {{the volume of}} surface seepage into mine workings at Hull Creek was 9.53 gallons per minute per inch of rainfall. The rate of <b>streambed</b> seepage in the area {{was estimated to be}} 17.02 gallons per minute per inch of rainfall. The rate of seepage is much higher than a number of other streams in the area.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} of sewage contamination, including sewer odors and debris, in the lower reaches of Nanticoke Creek. The city of Nanticoke has a permit to discharge sewage into the creek. Four combined sewer overflows {{are present in the}} watershed. Orange sediment is deposited on the creek's <b>streambed,</b> indicating a high concentration of iron in the waters. Yellow boy is also present along the creek in some places and can be seen from South Cross Valley Expressway. The concentration of total dissolved solids in the creek is 622 milligrams per liter, higher than the United States Environmental Protection Agency criterion for suitability for aquatic life.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant du Plooy {{took his}} men {{around the bend}} behind cover, then sent his American medic, Corporal John Alan Coey of Columbus, Ohio, {{out into the open}} <b>streambed</b> to render medical assistance. Though his {{prominent}} Red Cross flag was clearly visible, the hidden cadres immediately opened fire on Coey, who was killed almost instantly by a shot through the head. His body fell at du Plooy's feet. The stand-off continued {{for the rest of the}} day, during which time du Plooy and one other RLI man were wounded. The security forces were only able to gather their dead for evacuation when darkness fell. During the night, the Rhodesians deployed stops in ambush positions around the insurgents' position to prevent an escape. When the guerrillas attempted to sneak through the security force perimeter in the early hours, they ran into Corporal Jannie de Beer's RLI men and a fire fight ensued; the nationalists shot de Beer dead and wounded one of his troopers as they broke through and quickly left the area. The morale of 2 Commando's men took a noticeable hit after this unsuccessful Fireforce in which the cadres had killed four Rhodesian soldiers and wounded four more.|$|E
5|$|Other {{specimens}} {{referred to}} Heterodontosaurus include the front {{part of a}} juvenile skull (SAM-PK-K10487), a fragmentary maxilla (SAM-PK-K1326), a left maxilla with teeth and adjacent bones (SAM-PK-K1334), {{all of which were}} collected at the Voyizane locality during expeditions in 1966-1967, although the first was only identified as belonging to this genus in 2008. A partial snout (NM QR 1788) found in 1975 on Tushielaw Farm south of Voyizane was thought to belong to Massospondylus until 2011, when it was reclassified as Heterodontosaurus. South African palaeontologist Robert Broom discovered a partial skull, possibly in the Clarens Formation of South Africa, which was sold to the American Museum of Natural History in 1913, as part of a collection that consisted almost entirely of synapsid fossils. This specimen (AMNH 24000) was first identified as belonging to a sub-adult Heterodontosaurus by Sereno, who reported it in a 2012 monograph about the Heterodontosauridae, the first comprehensive review article about the family. This review also classified a partial postcranial skeleton (SAM-PK-K1328) from Voyizane as Heterodontosaurus. However, in 2014, Galton suggested it might belong the related genus Pegomastax instead, which was named by Sereno based on a partial skull from the same locality. In 2005, a new Heterodontosaurus specimen was found in a <b>streambed</b> near Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape Province; it was the most complete individual known to date, but the rocks around it were too hard to fully remove. The specimen was therefore scanned at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in 2016, to help reveal the skeleton, and aid in future research of its anatomy and lifestyle.|$|E
25|$|Many {{areas in}} {{the upper reaches of}} Shamokin Creek support little or no macroinvertebrate life due to metals coating the <b>streambed.</b> In August 1999, more than 500 {{coliform}} colonies per 100 milliliters were observed in the creek near Shamokin, of which 97 were E. coli.|$|E
25|$|The {{sanctuary}} {{is located}} 37.2km NNE of Athens at a sacred spring; it contained a temple of Amphiaraos (with an acrolithic cult statue), {{as well as}} a theater, stoa, and associated structures. The temenos extended for some 240metres northeast from the Temple of Amphiaraos (hence Amphiareion) along a <b>streambed.</b> The cult, which was both public and private, dates to the 5th century BCE. There was an upswing in the sanctuary’s reputation as a healing site during the plague that hit Athens in the late 5th BCE Herodotus relates that the oracular response of this shrine was one of only two correct answers to the test put to them all by the Lydian king Croesus. There were many dedications from Greeks, notable Romans, and others, many with inscriptions. On the southeast side of the <b>streambed</b> there are extensive remains of domestic structures {{as well as a}}n unusually well-preserved clepsydra.|$|E
25|$|The Great Falls of the Missouri River {{marked the}} limit of the navigable section of the Missouri River for non-portagable watercraft, and the non-navigability of the falls was noted by the U.S. Supreme Court in its 2012 ruling against the State of Montana on the {{question}} of <b>streambed</b> ownership beneath several dams situated {{at the site of the}} falls. The first steamboat arrived at future site of the city in 1859.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydraulic}} jump {{is the most}} commonly used choice of design engineers for energy dissipation below spillways and outlets. A properly designed {{hydraulic jump}} can provide for 60-70% energy dissipation of the energy in the basin itself, limiting the damage to structures and the <b>streambed.</b> Even with such efficient energy dissipation, stilling basins must be carefully designed to avoid serious damage due to uplift, vibration, cavitation, and abrasion. An extensive literature has been developed for this type of engineering.|$|E
25|$|The free-draining soil {{of most of}} the EKLR's {{locality}} {{meant that}} there are few streams and hence few culverts. There is a brick-built example accessible west of Ash Town station, and another one on the private track north of Sandwich Road station, over the North Poulders Stream. East of Wingham Canterbury Road the railway crossed the Wingham Stream, and merely dropped a concrete pipe in the <b>streambed</b> and piled the embankment on top. Amazingly they got away with it; the arrangement survives.|$|E
25|$|In {{the design}} of a dam the energy of the fast-flowing stream over a {{spillway}} must be partially dissipated to prevent erosion of the <b>streambed</b> downstream of the spillway, which could ultimately lead to failure of the dam. This can be done by arranging for the formation of a hydraulic jump to dissipate energy. To limit damage, this hydraulic jump normally occurs on an apron engineered to withstand hydraulic forces and to prevent local cavitation and other phenomena which accelerate erosion.|$|E
25|$|In 1917, the Water Resources Inventory Report {{referred}} to Shamokin Creek {{as the worst}} stream in the Coal Region due to the mine water, culm deposits, and other problems. During this time period, the culm deposits were so extensive {{that it was one}} of the few creeks where it was commercially viable to recover coal from its <b>streambed.</b> The creek was black throughout its entire length and typically sluggish in its upper reaches, though it had fast reaches. However, it was clear at its headwaters.|$|E
25|$|Construction of dams in the San Joaquin {{watershed}} has led {{to nearly}} all of the good spawning streams, located higher in the mountains near the headwaters of the San Joaquin and its tributaries, being cut off to the salmon. The remaining areas left for the salmon to spawn in are undesirable. Prior to the building of the Friant Dam in 1944, the San Joaquin River was believed to have over 6,000 miles of <b>streambed</b> suitable and available to spawning salmon. However, in 1993 it was estimated that there was just 300 miles.|$|E
25|$|Construction on the dam {{started in}} 1929 with {{a joint venture}} by the Irvine Company and Serrano Irrigation District. After the site was graded, the dam was built using dirt and rock {{excavated}} {{from the sides of}} the canyon and from the <b>streambed</b> both above and below the dam site. The structure was completed in 1931 at a cost of $1 million, and its reservoir, Irvine Lake, filled by 1933. In the late 1930s, the lake was stocked with fish, and was opened to the public for recreational use in 1941.|$|E
25|$|Male {{pink salmon}} and some sockeye salmon develop {{pronounced}} humps {{just before they}} spawn. These humps may have evolved because they confer species advantages. The humps make it less likely the salmon will spawn in the shallow water at margins of the <b>streambed,</b> which tend to dry out during low water flows or freeze in winter. Further, riffles can contain many salmon spawning simultaneously, as in {{the image on the}} right. Predators, such as bears, {{will be more likely to}} catch the more visually prominent humped males, with their humps projecting above the surface of the water. This may provide a protective buffer for the females.|$|E
25|$|Having secretively flown {{virtually}} the entire width of Vietnam, the copter dropped in on its target. The two Lao commandos dropped the last {{few feet from the}} aircraft. The helicopter then flew off to a pre-selected tree on a 340-meter peak and dropped a mesh web supporting a camouflaged solar-powered communications relay over its crown. From there, the Hughes 500P moved again and settled into a dry <b>streambed</b> for a 20-minute wait while the commandos set up the wiretap. The hidey-hole turned near disastrous. A rock knifed the FLIR's liquid nitrogen tank; the resulting leak disabled the FLIR. At the same time, a radar detector began sounding its alarm. The pilot turned off the warning and settled in to wait for 20 minutes while the commandos worked. The enemy MiGs did not show up.|$|E
25|$|On the {{southeast}} {{side of the}} <b>streambed</b> opposite the sacred spring are the remains of an unusually well-preserved clepsydra. This instrument {{is important in the}} study of ancient methods of timekeeping in that it is an example of an inflow water clock. Since an inflow clock measures time by the filling of a known volume from a constant rate of inflow, it is much more accurate than an outflow water clock in measuring the gradations between full and empty. The clepsydra was composed of a central, square reservoir with a steep stairway on the south side to allow access to the bronze plug {{at the bottom of the}} reservoir. Domestic structures for the operation of the sanctuary are closely packed along {{the southeast}} side of the ravine, both north and south of the clepsydra.|$|E
25|$|The State of California Regional Water Quality Control Board {{considers}} {{the most significant}} water quality parameters in Sonoma Creek to be: turbidity, pathogens and nitrates. Turbidity is an issue because of historical problems of erosion of stream banks, especially {{in the presence of}} ongoing land development in Sonoma Valley. Increased sedimentation has a variety of adverse impacts including direct harm to aquatic organisms and the more specific impact of altering <b>streambed</b> gravels to reduce productivity of spawning habitats; additionally sedimentation of pools decreases the efficacy of anadromous fish summering habitat by increasing critical summer water temperatures in these pools. Pathogens appear to be linked to septic tank or leach field failures in some of the rural reaches, particularly in the upper valley sections. Nitrates enter the stream system from excess fertilizers applied to land uses in the drainage basin and may also be present in septic wastes improperly entering the creek. Sediment and nitrates may also enter the stream through urban stormwater runoff in the city of Sonoma reach.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Fere-Champenoise on 25 March, Roussel d'Hurbal and Ghigny were {{commanded}} by Augustin Daniel Belliard in Mortier's corps. After the Allied cavalry attacked Marshal Auguste de Marmont's force {{early in the}} morning, Mortier marched to join his colleague. Ghigny was posted facing east {{on the far left}} flank to watch a body of 1,000 Russian Cossacks. When the Russian cavalry threatened to turn the left flank, Ghigny was pulled back behind a stream, facing northeast. As more and more Allied cavalry appeared, the French marshals began to withdraw. Early in the afternoon the French right flank cavalry drove off a major attack, but the left flank cavalry suffered a setback. At 2:00 pm while the French troops were crossing a <b>streambed,</b> a powerful rainstorm struck, blinding them and wetting their gunpowder. The Allied cavalry charged, drove off the French cavalry and got among the infantry, breaking some squares and capturing most of the artillery. The marshals eventually rallied their troops, thanks to the fortuitous arrival of another march regiment, but French losses were heavy.|$|E

500|$|Bedrock composes {{much of the}} <b>streambed</b> in {{the upper}} and lower reaches of the Kootenay, but in the middle portion, {{alluvial}} sediments allow the river to meander over a broader valley floor. The sediments probably originated through heavy glaciation during the previous Ice Age. About 15,000 years ago, the Cordilleran Ice Sheet advanced southwards into present-day BC, Montana and Idaho, blocking the Kootenay River at the outlet of Kootenay Lake, which [...] did not yet exist. Glaciers covered most of the northern Kootenay River watershed and heavily shaped the peaks and valleys one sees today. The glacier that formed Kootenay Lake caused the river to back up into an enormous body of water that stretched all the way to Libby, Montana, near where the Libby Dam now stands, and possibly even connected to Lake Pend Oreille, which also was much enlarged at the time. Glacially deposited sediments buried the old <b>streambed</b> of the Kootenay River and created a natural dam where the Kootenay turns west out of Kootenay Lake. After the glaciers retreated, Kootenay Lake receded to its present level and the Kootenay Flats were formed.|$|E
500|$|Invasive species—those {{that are}} not native to the region—have caused {{problems}} in the watershed for many years. One of the most troublesome invasive species is the giant reed, which plagues many coastal Southern California waterways. The giant reed {{is similar to a}} tall grass or thin bamboo, but grows quickly and can take over native stands of vegetation, block the <b>streambed,</b> hurts the habitat of native animals, and increases the hazard of wildfires. Perhaps the largest effect that giant reed has is its usage of water. To support its fast growth rate, the giant reed population in the Santa Ana River watershed can consume [...] of water per year.|$|E
500|$|Cambrian to Ordovician-age dolomite, {{part of the}} Wappinger Group, and {{calcareous}} shales {{from the}} Hudson River Group underlie the Fonteyn Kill. Between 15–20 kya, a glacial lake covered the land that would become the Fonteyn Kill. Till {{and to a lesser}} extent other glacial sediments today sit atop the dolomite and shale. Surrounding soils are loamy, either silt loam or gravelly loam depending on the underlying surficial geology. The <b>streambed</b> is composed of about 25% sand, silt, and clay and approximately 75% cobbles. Quicksand was once common around the Fonteyn Kill and its minor tributaries. The distance covered by the stream is noted as being relatively flat, descending between [...] over the course of its run.|$|E
500|$|The {{surveyed}} route crossed {{hundreds of}} streams and rivers. To cross these with the pipeline, engineers designed concrete [...] "jackets" [...] to surround the pipe and weight it down {{so it would}} sink {{to the bottom of}} the stream or river. Because oil is lighter than water, the pipeline would float without the concrete jackets. Dredging rivers and burying the pipeline in the <b>streambed</b> was not allowed due to environmental concerns. In several places—either out of fear of disturbing the river or because of the river's characteristics—pipeline bridges were constructed. The most notable of these are over the Yukon River and the Tanana River. To protect against corrosion in these wet environments, the pipeline was designed with cathodic protection.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Adams {{experienced}} two slides {{seven weeks}} apart {{that were the}} largest slides in the Cascades, ignoring the catastrophic landslide eruption of Mount St. Helens, since a slide that occurred on Little Tahoma in 1963.

500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of any land {{transportation}} route to the dam site, the first stage of construction would have involved the building of a temporary road from Eureka, about [...] away, to the dam site. Consideration also was given to the extension of the Alaska Railroad from Fairbanks to the site. A period of about four years would have been required for preconstruction planning, including detailed construction surveying and finalizing the design of the dam, powerhouse, and other structures. Engineers estimated that after the four years of final planning and surveying, three years would be needed to dig river diversion tunnels and construct the cofferdams needed to clear the Yukon River <b>streambed</b> for construction. Housing and construction offices also would have been constructed for workers on the south bank of the site, and the cost for this effort was included in overall cost proposals for the project.|$|E
500|$|Yogo sapphires {{were first}} {{discovered}} in alluvial <b>streambed</b> sediments during gold mining operations in Yogo Gulch downstream from the Yogo dike, but were later traced to their source within igneous bedrock. [...] Worldwide, {{other than the}} Yogo Gulch deposit and one small site in the Kashmir region, most other corundum is mined from the sand and gravel created by the weathering of metamorphic rock. Alluvial sapphires {{are found in the}} Far East, Australia, and in three other Montana locations—the upper Missouri River, Rock Creek, and Dry Cottonwood Creek. The location of most Yogo sapphires within igneous rock rather than from alluvial placer deposits requires difficult hard rock mining. [...] Coupled with American labor costs, this makes their extraction fairly expensive. At least [...] are estimated to still be in the ground. The Yogo dike is [...] "the only known igneous rock from which sapphire is mined".|$|E
500|$|The Saw Mill River's {{water quality}} varies, {{reflecting}} {{its history and}} surroundings. Its headwaters {{in the town of}} New Castle are considered [...] "relatively healthy". There the river is less disturbed, and its ecosystem supports a diversity of organisms. In Yonkers, where it flows through a concrete-lined channel, there is less life in the water and it is considered to be environmentally impaired. A 1983 United States Geological Survey (USGS) study found that concentrations of heavy metals in the water increased further downstream, a phenomenon observed with many other pollutants in the river and correlated with the urbanization around and above its mouth. DDT was detected in the <b>streambed</b> sediments throughout the river. In its final , more than 50 micrograms of PCBs were found per kilogram of water. In the 1990s, the USGS found that of the 35 Hudson tributaries it tested, the Saw Mill had the worst levels of cadmium, copper, mercury, nickel and zinc in the sediments near its mouth, and among the worst nationwide (however, only the river's manganese levels were found to exceed federal standards). It is believed to add more pollution to the Hudson than any other single tributary.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Streambed</b> {{topography}} is {{the primary}} factor in creating rapids, and is generally consistent over time.
