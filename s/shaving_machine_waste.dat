40|$|Abstract—Plunge shaving is {{the most}} {{advanced}} gear finishing technique which only needs radial infeed. Its advantages include increased productivity, accuracy, long tool life, and a simple machine structure. For the plunge shaving method, the gear tooth modification only depends on the surface geometry of the plunge shaving cutter. The analytical description of the gear with tooth modifications is firstly constructed by B-spline surface fitting. Then, the grinding wheel profile is parameterized and optimized for minimizing the surface deviations of theoretical and ground (from re-sharpening machine) tooth surfaces of the plunge shaving cutter, in which the topographic error has been reduced. The cutting trace of plunge shaving cutter has also been analyzed so that the shaving efficiency can be improved. Index Terms—Gear plunge shaving, Cone grinding wheel, Topographic error, Shaving cutter serration. et al. [9] proposed a method for shaving gears with double crowning by CNC <b>shaving</b> <b>machine.</b> For <b>shaving</b> methods other than plunge shaving, the gear tooth modification is accomplished by tooth modifications of the shaving cutter and the coordinated motions between cutter and gear. For the plunge shaving method, however, it only depends on the surface geometry of the plunge shaving cutter. Focusing on the surface geometry of shaving cutter, what’s really significant is precision of the region between SAP. (start of active profile) and EAP. (end of active profile) as shown in Fig. 1. In gear shaving, SAP. of cutter tooth shaves the gear tooth tip while EAP. shaves the gear tooth root. Traditionally, the cutter surface geometry results from a cutter re-sharpening machine by trial and error, which is very time-consuming. I...|$|R

40|$|Office {{machines}} (such as printers, scanners, fax, and copiers) can consume {{significant amounts}} of power. Few studies have been devoted to power management of office equipment. Most office machines have sleep modes to save power. Power management of these machines are usually timeout-based: a machine sleeps after being idle long enough. Setting the timeout duration can be difficult: if it is too long, the <b>machine</b> <b>wastes</b> power during idleness. If it is too short, the machine sleeps too soon and too often—the wakeup delay can significantly degrade productivity. Thus, power management is a tradeoff between saving energy and keeping short response time. Many power management policies have been published and one policy may outperform another in some scenarios. There is no definite conclusion which policy is always better. This thesis describes two methods for office equipment power management. The first method adaptively reduces power based on a constraint of the wakeup delay. The second method is a hybrid with multiple candidate policies and it selects the most appropriate power management policy. Using six months of request traces from 18 different offices, we demonstrate that the hybrid policy outperforms individual policies. We also discover that power management based on business hours does not produce consistent energy savings. ...|$|R
