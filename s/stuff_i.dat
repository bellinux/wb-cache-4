5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through <b>stuff.</b> <b>I</b> mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E
25|$|I {{would try}} to change the science into {{something}} reasonable; Stuart would change it back to Saturday morning cartoon <b>stuff.</b> <b>I</b> tried to make believable, reasonable characters, and Stuart would insist on throwing in clichés and caricatures. It was especially annoying because it was a story about soldiers, and I was the only person around who'd ever been one.|$|E
25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of <b>stuff.</b> <b>I</b> was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E

500|$|The {{career of}} the {{character}} Daniel Baciagalupo/Danny Angel in the novel bears numerous similarities to that of John Irving. [...] In an October 2009 interview with the New York magazine, Irving stated: [...] "I tried {{to have fun with}} the self-referential <b>stuff.</b> <b>I</b> felt the need to be a little playful, because there were autobiographical parts of the last novel that were difficult for me." [...] In his last novel, Until I Find You (2005) Irving had alluded to his sexual initiation when he was 11, by a woman in her 20s.|$|E

I went through a lot of personal turmoil right around the time Audioslave formed and unfortunately I think that affected the band a little bit in terms of me not really being grounded.... I think there was stuff that could have been resolved, and there was drama that was probably unnecessary, typical rock band <b>stuff.</b> <b>I</b> certainly played a role in it. I definitely feel like I was part of a lot of unnecessary stuff. It didn't need to become what it became. You learn with experience." ...|$|E
500|$|Josh Harrison of {{entertainment}} website Ology rated the episode 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] " [...] was one to remember". Harrison {{noted that the}} writers appear to explore the characters' backgrounds during the second season, like how Leonard's background was in focus in [...] "Wet Hot Demonic Summer". Harrison concluded his review while commenting on [...] "Callie and Her Sister": [...] "This sort of episode {{is still in its}} early stages, but I don't begrudge Ugly Americans the training wheels if it means we get to better know the people and creatures of the fascinating animated world. Good <b>stuff,</b> <b>I</b> say, and I'd like to see more of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Questlove also {{acknowledged}} J Dilla's {{influence over the}} recording sessions for Voodoo. He said of Dilla's unique programming method during the sessions, [...] "He makes programmed stuff so real, you really can’t tell it’s programmed. He might program 128 bars, with absolutely no looping or quantizing ... When Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest first played me some of his <b>stuff,</b> <b>I</b> said, 'The drums are messed up! The time is wrong!' And when we did a song for D'Angelo's record that Lenny Kravitz was supposed to play on, Lenny said, 'I can’t play with this — there’s a discrepancy in the drum pattern.'

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to the episode's subplot involving Kelly and Ryan {{was largely}} positive. McNutt called Novak's acting [...] "some of [...] best {{work in a}} long time". He called the plots conclusion [...] "the sort of screwed up situation that The Office does well". White wrote that [...] "If it weren't for [...] story ... I might have written this clumsy episode off entirely." [...] Forcella enjoyed the plot, praising the ending {{due to the fact}} that it concluded with [...] "boos and hisses". However, he was confused with the casting, noting that [...] "why bring Sendhil Ramamurthy in for one scene? ... He seems more like someone you bring in for a multi-episode arc." [...] Hyatt lauded the scenes, and wrote [...] "the Ryan-Kelly <b>stuff</b> <b>I</b> give a 10/10." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Hoglan {{initially}} {{denied the}} definitive break-up of the band, {{saying they would}} go on tour in March 2007, he later stated Strapping Young Lad is on [...] "extended hiatus", and might never reunite again. In May 2007, during a press conference held to promote his new solo album, Ziltoid the Omniscient, Townsend announced his plans to retreat from public view, including giving interviews and touring, to concentrate on his family, and producing solo albums, {{as well as other}} people's music. As a result, Strapping Young Lad were effectively disbanded. Townsend discussed his future projects in a May 2007 Metal Hammer interview, where he stated [...] "there may be some <b>stuff</b> <b>I</b> do in the future that is as brutal and heavy as Strapping, it's just not going to be Strapping".|$|E

It took a while because at the beginning, I was very aware of playing this horrible melody, if you could call it a melody, and I knew I had to feel something.

He {{recorded}} [...] "The <b>Stuff</b> <b>Is</b> Here" [...] and [...] "Stop Cryin' Blues". His 1961 song [...] "Overseas Blues" [...] retrospectively expressed the fear of World War II servicemen who had survived the conflict in Europe and were sent to fight in the Pacific War.|$|R
500|$|Manson {{recorded}} his vocals at his Hollywood Hills home studio between November 2008 and his January 5, 2009 birthday. He described the album as containing [...] "extreme" [...] autobiographical content {{relating to the}} dissolution of both his marriage to burlesque artist Dita Von Teese, and his later relationship with then-19-year old actress Evan Rachel Wood, explaining: [...] "Some of the things I say here, it's sad to say them—they're relationship-destroying statements. Some of it is <b>stuff</b> <b>I</b> should have said to my ex-wife. Some are things I've never said to the world." [...] Manson used his home as a canvas to document the disintegration {{of his relationship with}} Wood, writing the album's lyrics on walls and coupling them with paintings and drawings, as well as used condoms, bags of cocaine and other drug paraphernalia. Much of the album's artwork was shot there.|$|E
500|$|On September 23, 2010, rapper Q-Tip {{confirmed}} {{working on}} Jay-Z's twelfth [...] studio album, with a tentative release in 2011.

He picked a couple of my joints that he's working on. I don't even wanna say too much about Jay, but we definitely working on some <b>stuff.</b> <b>I</b> haven't even sent him a bunch of beats. I sent him my favorite stuff. He hit me right back like, 'Yo, I'ma go in on this,' or, 'I like this.'" [...] The album development was kept a secret, but The-Dream hinted about a new Jay-Z album in an April 2013 interview with Hot 97.|$|E
500|$|For the Beatles' seminal 1967 album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Starr sang lead vocals on the Lennon–McCartney {{composition}} [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends". Although the Beatles {{had enjoyed}} widespread commercial and critical success with Sgt. Pepper, {{the long hours}} they spent recording the LP contributed to Starr's increased feeling of alienation within the band, he commented: [...] " [...] wasn't our best album. That was the peak for everyone else, but {{for me it was}} a bit like being a session musician ... They more or less direct me in the style I can play." [...] His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison. During his down-time Starr worked on his guitar playing; he commented: [...] "I jump into chords that no one seems to get into. Most of the <b>stuff</b> <b>I</b> write is twelve-bar".|$|E

500|$|Franken said {{he learned}} that 21% of Americans {{received}} most of their news from talk radio, an almost exclusively conservative medium. Said Franken, [...] "I didn't want {{to sit on the}} sidelines, and I believed Air America could make a difference." [...] In November 2003, Franken talked about moving back to his home state of Minnesota to run for the Senate. At the time the seat, once held by Wellstone, was occupied by Republican Norm Coleman. At a 2004 Democratic presidential campaign event, Franken tackled a man who was allegedly threatening other attendees and heckling Governor Howard Dean. [...] In 2005, Franken announced his move to Minnesota: [...] "I can tell you honestly, I don't know if I'm going to run, but I'm doing the <b>stuff</b> <b>I</b> need {{to do in order to}} do it." [...] In late 2005, Franken started his own political action committee, called Midwest Values PAC. By early 2007, the PAC raised more than $1 million.|$|E
500|$|I {{was running}} back and forth, literally, from the editing room with [...] Jonas Akerlund to working with Stuart, who was also mixing the music in the film. We were together, non-stop, all of us. Cutting 350 hours of film down to two hours. There {{are a lot of}} serious aspects to the movie. I needed a release. When I would go to Stuart's, and we'd go up to his loft, it was like, 'Honey, I want to dance.' I wanted to be happy, silly and buoyant. I wanted to lift myself and others up with this record. So, yes, the new album was a {{reaction}} to all the other <b>stuff</b> <b>I</b> was doing, which was very serious in nature. I hope that doesn't imply that I wanted to make a superficial record, because it's not. I want people to smile when they hear this record. I wanted it to put a smile on my face, too.|$|E
500|$|Ice-T {{introduced}} the band at Lollapalooza in 1991, devoting {{half of his}} set to his hip hop songs, and half to Body Count songs, increasing his appeal with both alternative rock fans and middle-class teenagers. Many considered the Body Count performances to be {{the highlight of the}} tour. The group made its first album appearance on Ice-T's 1991 solo album O.G. Original Gangster. The song [...] "Body Count" [...] was preceded by a staged interview in which the performer referred to the group as a [...] "black hardcore band," [...] stating that [...] "as far as I'm concerned, music is music. I don't look at it as rock, R & B, or all that kind of <b>stuff.</b> <b>I</b> just look at it as music.
