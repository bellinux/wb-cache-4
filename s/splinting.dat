5|$|Emergency medical {{technician}} – Also known as Ambulance Technician. Technicians are usually {{able to perform}} {{a wide range of}} emergency care skills, such as defibrillation, spinal immobilization, bleeding control, <b>splinting</b> of suspected fractures, assisting the patient with certain medications, and oxygen therapy. Some countries split this term into levels (such as in the US, where there is EMT-Basic and EMT-Intermediate).|$|E
5|$|Most {{cases of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} resolve {{with time and}} conservative methods of treatment. Usually {{for the first few}} weeks people are advised to rest, change their activities, take pain medications, and stretch. If this is not sufficient physiotherapy, orthotics, <b>splinting,</b> or steroid injections may be options. If other measures do not work extracorporeal shockwave therapy or surgery may be tried.|$|E

50|$|A vacuum <b>splint</b> is {{a device}} {{like a small}} vacuum {{mattress}} that is used in emergency medicine as a temporary <b>splint.</b> Vacuum <b>splints</b> operate by extracting air from the <b>splint</b> itself to enable the thousands of polystyrene balls inside the <b>splint</b> to mold around the injured body part similar to an orthopedic cast. Vacuum <b>splints</b> are primarily used by paramedics to <b>splint</b> trauma-related injuries, joint dislocation, subluxation, and extremity fractures.|$|R
50|$|A spica <b>splint</b> {{consists}} of a metal enclosed in a fabric, which is pliable and can be moulded according to the shape {{and size of the}} hand. Velcro strips are used to secure and maintain the <b>splint</b> on the hand and help in comfortably fitting the <b>splint</b> to a variety of hands. Even injuries like metacarpal fractures and wrist fractures can benefit from spica <b>splints.</b> Thumb Spica <b>splint,</b> Cock-up <b>splint,</b> are used for acute injuries like sprains and fractures. Dynamic Cock-up <b>splint</b> is a special kind of spica <b>splint,</b> which is used in nerve palsies of the hand for preventing contractures and physical therapy.|$|R

25|$|Skillwise, a {{certified}} first responder in the US is often trained {{and allowed to}} do most of what an emergency medical technician is allowed to. Some exceptions in some jurisdictions include insertion of King airways or combi-tubes, traction <b>splinting,</b> and administration of nebulized albuteral.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{accepted}} treatments include: physiotherapy, steroids either orally or injected locally, <b>splinting,</b> {{and surgical}} {{release of the}} transverse carpal ligament. Limited evidence suggests that gabapentin is no more effective than placebo for CTS treatment. There is insufficient evidence for therapeutic ultrasound, yoga, acupuncture, low level laser therapy, vitamin B6, and exercise. Change in activity may include avoiding activities that worsen symptoms.|$|E
50|$|They {{generally}} {{cover all}} {{the teeth of the}} upper or lower arch, but partial coverage is sometimes used. Occlusal <b>splints</b> are usually used on either the upper or the lower teeth, termed maxillary <b>splints</b> or mandibular <b>splints</b> respectively, but sometimes both types are used at the same time. Maxillary <b>splints</b> are more common, although various situations favor mandibular <b>splints.</b>|$|R
50|$|Occlusal <b>splints</b> (also termed bite plates or intra-oral appliances) {{are often}} used by dentists to treat TMD. They are usually made of acrylic and can be hard or soft. They can be {{designed}} to fit onto the upper teeth or the lower teeth. They may cover all the teeth in one arch (full coverage <b>splint)</b> or only some (partial coverage <b>splint).</b> <b>Splints</b> are also termed according to their intended mechanism, such as the anterior positioning <b>splint</b> or the stabilization <b>splint.</b> Although occlusal <b>splints</b> are generally considered a reversible treatment, sometimes partial coverage <b>splints</b> lead to pathologic tooth migration (changes {{in the position of}} teeth). Normally <b>splints</b> are only worn during sleep, and therefore probably do nothing for people who engage in parafunctional activities during wakefulness rather than during sleep. There is slightly more evidence for the use of occlusal <b>splints</b> in sleep bruxism than in TMD. A <b>splint</b> can also have a diagnostic role if it demonstrates excessive occlusal wear after a period of wearing it each night. This may confirm the presence of sleep bruxism if it was in doubt. Soft <b>splints</b> are occasionally reported to worsen discomfort related to TMD. Specific types of occlusal <b>splint</b> are discussed below.|$|R
40|$|<b>Splint</b> or {{orthopedic}} appliances {{is routinely}} {{used in the}} treatment of temporomandibular disorders (TMD). This appliance is used to alter occlusal relationship and to redistribute occlusal forces, to prevent wear and mobility of the teeth, to reduce bruxism and parafunction, to treat masticatory muscle pain and dysfunction, and to alter structural relationship of the TMJ. There are 2 kinds of <b>splint,</b> the permissive and non permissive. Stabilization <b>splint</b> and bite plane are permissive <b>splints,</b> and anterior repositioning appliance is a non permissive <b>splint.</b> Each kind of <b>splint</b> has its own indication. There is strong evidence that <b>splint</b> therapy is successful {{in the treatment of}} TMD, but there is no consenses of opinion on how <b>splints</b> work. </p...|$|R
25|$|Being {{physically}} active can decrease {{the risk of}} developing CTS. Symptoms can be improved by wearing a wrist splint or with corticosteroid injections. Taking NSAIDs or gabapentin {{does not appear to be}} useful. Surgery to cut the transverse carpal ligament is effective with better results at a year compared to non surgical options. Further <b>splinting</b> after surgery is not needed. Evidence does not support magnet therapy.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{the term}} orthopedics meant the {{correcting}} of musculoskeletal deformities in children. Nicolas Andry, a French {{professor at the}} University of Paris coined the term in the first textbook written on the subject in 1741. He advocated the use of exercise, manipulation and <b>splinting</b> to treat deformities in children. His book was directed towards parents, and while some topics would be familiar to orthopedists today, it also included 'excessive sweating of the palms' and freckles.|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{departments}} in the military benefit from the added support of enlisted personnel {{who are capable of}} performing a wide variety of tasks they have been trained for through specialized military schooling. For example, in United States Military Hospitals, Air Force Aerospace Medical Technicians and Navy Hospital Corpsmen perform tasks that fall under the scope of practice of both doctors (i.e. sutures, staples and incision and drainages) and nurses (i.e. medication administration, foley catheter insertion, and obtaining intravenous access) and also perform <b>splinting</b> of injured extremities, nasogastric tube insertion, intubation, wound cauterizing, eye irrigation, and much more. Often, some civilian education and/or certification will be required such as an EMT certification, in case of the need to provide care outside the base where the member is stationed. The presence of highly trained enlisted personnel in an Emergency Departments drastically reduces the workload on nurses and doctors.|$|E
40|$|Study Design: Case Study Series. [...] Introduction: Restriction of forearm {{rotation}} may {{be required}} for effective management and rehabilitation of the upper limb after trauma. [...] Purpose of the Study: To compare the effectiveness of four <b>splints</b> in restricting forearm rotation. [...] Methods: Muenster, Sugartong, antipronation distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ), and standard wrist <b>splints</b> were fabricated for five healthy participants. Active range of motion (AROM) in forearm pronation and supination was measured with a goniometer for each <b>splint,</b> at the initial point of sensory feedback and during exertion of maximal force. [...] Results: Repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated significant differences between <b>splints</b> for all four AROM measures. Post hoc paired t-tests showed that the Sugartong <b>splint</b> was significantly more restrictive in pronation than the Muenster <b>splint.</b> The antipronation DRUJ <b>splint</b> provided significantly greater restriction in pronation than the standard wrist <b>splint.</b> No <b>splints</b> immobilized the forearm completely.

[...] Potential treatment interventions include <b>splinting,</b> therapeutic exercise, manual stretching, soft tissue and joint mobilization, postural training and bracing, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, constraint-induced movement therapy, activity and environmental modification, and gait training.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the difference in task performance, grip and pinch strength, and dexterity with and without cock-up <b>splints,</b> which are widely used in occupational therapy prac-tice. [Methods] Twenty-three participants performed Jebsen-Taylor hand function test and grooved pegboard for task performance and dexterity. The power grip and pinch strength was measured using Jamar hydraulic hand dy-namometer and pinch gauge. [Results] In the result of the Jebsen-Taylor hand function test, task performance with the cock-up <b>splint</b> was slower compared to without the <b>splint</b> for all items. Men’s grip power with the cock-up <b>splint</b> was found to be significantly decreased compared to without the <b>splint.</b> Women’s grip and palmar pinch strength with the <b>splint</b> decreased significantly compared to without the <b>splint.</b> In the grooved pegboard test, the dexterity of both men and women with the cock-up <b>splint</b> decreased significantly compared to without the <b>splint.</b> [Conclusion] To assist patients to make wise decisions regarding the use of <b>splints,</b> occupational therapists must have empirical knowledge of the topic as well as an understanding of the theoretical, technical, and related research evidence. The results of this study will be useful in the analysis and understanding of changes in hand function in <b>splint</b> applica-tions for people with hand dysfunction...|$|R

Soft acrylic or light cured composite, or vinyl <b>splints</b> may be made more quickly and cheaply, but are not as durable, and are more commonly made for short-term use.

2500|$|The {{scope of}} medical {{practice}} for EMTs is regulated by state law, and can vary significantly both among {{states as well}} as inside states. In general, EMTs provide what is considered basic life support and are limited to essentially non-invasive procedures. Besides employing basic medical assessment skills, typical procedures provided by EMTs include CPR, Automated external defibrillation, mechanical ventilation using a bag-valve mask, placement of air way adjuncts such as oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airways, pulse oximetry, glucose testing using a glucometer, <b>splinting</b> (including spinal immobilization and traction splints), and suctioning. In addition, EMT-Bs are trained to assist patients with administration of certain prescribed medications, including nitroglycerin, Metered-dose inhaler such as albuterol, and epinephrine auto injectors such as the EpiPen. EMT-Bs can typically also administer certain non-preprescribed drugs including oxygen, oral glucose, and activated charcoal (usually upon medical direction). In response to the opioid overdose epidemic, states are rapidly changing protocols to permit EMT-Bs to administer naloxone as well.|$|E
2500|$|Although some dentists advise {{that the}} best {{treatment}} for an avulsed tooth is immediate replantation, {{for a variety of}} reasons this can be difficult for the non-professional person. The teeth are often covered with debris. This debris must be washed off with a physiological solution and not scrubbed. Often multiple teeth are knocked-out and the person will not know which socket an individual tooth belongs to. The injured victim may have other more serious injuries that require more immediate attention or injuries such as a severely lacerated bleeding lip or gum that prevent easy visualization of the socket. Pain may be severe and the person may resist replantation of the teeth. People may, in light of infectious diseases (e.g. HIV), fear handling the teeth or touching the blood associated with them. If immediate replantation is not possible, the teeth should be placed in an appropriate storage solution and brought to a dentist who can then replant them. The dentist will clean the socket, wash the teeth if necessary, and replant them into their sockets. He will splint them to non-knocked-out teeth for a maximum of two weeks for teeth with normal alveolar process and bone support. Properly handled, even replantation of periodontally compromised permanent teeth in older patients under good maintenance have been reported, with <b>splinting</b> extending for over 4 weeks due to the reduced support structure for the root due to periodontal disease. [...] One week to ten days after the replantation, the dental pulps of the replanted teeth should be removed and a root canal treatment completed within two months.|$|E

Dynamic <b>splinting</b> is contraindicated If there is an unstable fracture, Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) or a bone to bone end feel.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Splints</b> usually cause mild {{lameness}} (a {{grade of}} 1-2 out of 5). The injured area is hot, painful, and inflamed {{with a small}} bony swelling.

30|$|The {{most common}} {{conservative}} therapy for ADD without {{reduction of the}} TMJ {{is the use of}} a <b>splint.</b> <b>Splints</b> can be classified into three major groups on the basis of function: stabilization <b>splints</b> (centric <b>splints),</b> distraction <b>splints,</b> and anterior repositioning <b>splints.</b> Although there are slight differences among the three kinds of <b>splints,</b> <b>splint</b> therapy generally does not reposition the disc on the condyle, although it allows the retrodiscal tissue to produce a pseudodisc where the condyle can function without limitation or pain. With <b>splints,</b> functional recovery of the TMJ can be obtained by adaptation of the retrodiscal tissue, without recapturing the displaced disc. <b>Splint</b> therapy can also decrease loading of the TMJ and remove the triggering mechanisms that program the neuromuscular system to maintain the mandible in an abnormal position [12 – 15]. Although several studies demonstrated that <b>splint</b> therapy significantly improved MMO and reduced subjective pain in patients with ADD without reduction of the TMJ, the effects of <b>splints</b> on ADD without reduction of the TMJ remain controversial [5, 16]. Haketa et al. [5] recently conducted a randomized clinical study evaluating the therapeutic efficacy between two treatment options for ADD without reduction: an occlusal <b>splint</b> and joint mobilization self-exercises. Their results suggested that joint mobilization self-exercises are an effective treatment option for improving jaw function and reducing pain and limitations of daily activities in patients with ADD without reduction. Kuboki et al. [17] reported that the elevator muscles are located behind the most posterior tooth and, therefore, the TMJ is always loaded when the elevators contract. It is usually necessary to wear <b>splints</b> for 6  months to 2  years, depending on the patient. Such long treatment periods can be a disadvantage in elderly patients with ADD without reduction of the TMJ. In addition, elderly patients with this condition have often had symptoms for a prolonged duration, and their disc frequently has an abnormal morphology. These factors can reduce the likelihood of achieving functional recovery of the TMJ with <b>splint</b> therapy. Moreover, although <b>splints</b> are {{considered one of the most}} effective treatment options available for ADD without reduction of the TMJ, further studies will be necessary to clarify the mechanism and efficacy of <b>splint</b> therapy.|$|R
