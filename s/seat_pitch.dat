5|$|On 23 March 1998, Braathens SAFE {{changed its}} name and {{corporate}} identity to Braathens. It introduced a new livery with a blue bottom, and replaced the Norwegian flag on the tail with an abstract, silver wing, that became the company's new logo. The re-branding {{was an attempt to}} create an international identity, and tone down the Norwegian national symbols that had been on the airplanes since 1946. At the same time, a two-class configuration was introduced: the 'Best' section, accounting for 70% of the planes capacity, received higher <b>seat</b> <b>pitch,</b> complimentary in-flight drinks, meals and newspapers, priority boarding and refundable tickets. The 'Back' section was for discount ticket holders, who received a no-frills service with a smaller <b>seat</b> <b>pitch,</b> and were located {{at the back of the}} aircraft behind a curtain. Best tickets became NOK300 more expensive, while it became easier to purchase discounted tickets. The scheme was, according to Erik G. Braathen, an attempt to differentiate between the full-fare customers, with whom Braathens was competing with SAS, and the low-fare customers, who Braathens was competing with Ryanair and the to-be established Color Air. The scheme as first introduced on the first 737-700 that was delivered.|$|E

25|$|The service ran at a {{loss and}} had been {{supported}} by government subsidies until these were abolished for all long-distance passenger trains in 1989. New Zealand Rail changed the seating configuration by replacing the very generous <b>seat</b> <b>pitch</b> three abreast configuration with a more standard four abreast, with reduced (but still generous compared to bus) <b>seat</b> <b>pitch.</b> The full service buffet car was replaced with a buffet servery.

Back tickets were sold with a discount, but had to be bought at least seven days before travel, and the traveller had to be away over a weekend. There were also some discounted Best tickets, but these never cost as little as the Back tickets.|$|E
25|$|Originally, Porter ordered ten 70-seat Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 turboprops, {{with ten}} more as options, at a value {{estimated}} by Porter of over $500 million. In June 2009, Porter exercised the option on the 19th and 20th Dash 8s. Porter chose the 70-seat configuration (less than the maximum of 78 seats) {{due to the}} short length of the runway at Toronto Island Airport; a fully loaded 78-seat configuration would need a longer runway than available at the airport. This means Porter aircraft have a slightly greater <b>seat</b> <b>pitch</b> than a 78-seat aircraft. The 70-seat configuration also allows Porter to use the shorter runway 11/29 at Newark. In May 2010, Porter announced that it intended to order seven more Dash 8 Q400. On August 6, 2010, {{it was announced that}} Porter had ordered four more Q400s with options for six more. In November 2011, Porter Airlines accepted two new Bombardier Q400 NextGen aircraft, bringing the company’s fleet to 26. In late 2013, Porter added an additional 4 seats to all of their Q400s, giving them a total of 74 seats per aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Lion Air, {{the parent}} company of Batik Air, created Batik Air as a full-service airline which began {{operations}} in May 2013 using Boeing 737-900ERs leased from Lion Air. Batik Air's 737-900ERs were fitted with two-class seating, replacing Lion Air's one-class 737-900ER service. Batik Air provides a personal television (in-flight entertainment system) in every seat, light snacks and free meals, <b>seat</b> <b>pitches</b> of 32 in for economy class and 45 in for business class, and a free baggage allowance of 20 kg for economy class and 30 kg for business class. In mid-2012, Lion Air signed a commitment with Boeing for five 787 Dreamliners for Batik Air, intending to have them delivered by 2015. Lion Air later cancelled this deal and temporarily shelved its plans for the long-haul expansion of Batik Air.|$|R
25|$|Configured with 85 seats, {{the cabin}} was spacious and {{well-appointed}} with comfortable seats widely spaced, giving plenty of legroom, {{but due to}} the low cabin floor and wide diameter, there was much unusable space which limited baggage and cargo volume. The inefficient use of cabin volume contributed greatly to the low payload/TOW ratio which was much {{lower than that of}} the contemporary Ilyushin Il-18, but which was still higher than the Tupolev Tu-104. A later production version, the An-10A, addressed some of the efficiency concerns by increasing the number of seats from 85 to 89 and 100 (in the two versions of the An-10A), then to 117–118 and finally 132 through reducing <b>seat</b> <b>pitch</b> and changing the cabin layout. Powered by Ivchenko AI-20K engines the An-10A demonstrated superior performance and an increased maximum payload of 14.5 Tonnes (31,970lb). The auxiliary endplate fins eventually gave way to improved splayed ventral fins under the rear fuselage. The directional stability was now acceptable and the new ventral fins also improved longitudinal stability at high g and on landing approach, as well as delaying the onset of Mach buffet to M0.702. Due to being sited in an area of flow separation, the new ventral fins also caused unpleasant vibrations. Following results of flight tests and at least two fatal crashes, an effective tailplane deicing system was retrofitted to all remaining aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with X, an indoor roller coaster in Thorpe Park, EnglandX2 (formerly known as X) is a steel roller coaster operating at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California. It is the world's first 4th Dimension roller coaster and was the final roller coaster conceived and installed by ride manufacturer Arrow Dynamics. The ride is unique in that the trains' <b>seats</b> <b>pitch</b> 360 degrees forwards and in reverse independent of the main chassis. The coaster initially opened to the public on January 12, 2002; numerous malfunctions delayed it from debuting in 2001 as was originally anticipated.
