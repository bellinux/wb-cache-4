40|$|Over{{expression}} of the Vibrio fischeri sensor kinase RscS induces {{expression of}} the syp (symbiosis polysac-charide) gene cluster and promotes biofilm phenotypes such as wrinkled colony morphology, pellicle formation, and <b>surface</b> <b>adherence.</b> RscS is predicted to be a hybrid sensor kinase with a histidine kinase/ATPase (HATPase) domain, a receiver (Rec) domain, and a histidine phosphotransferase (Hpt) domain. Bioinformatic analysis also revealed the following three potential signal detection domains within RscS: two transmembrane helices forming a transmembrane region (TMR), a large periplasmic (PP) domain, and a cytoplasmic PAS domain. In this work, we genetically dissected the contributions of these domains to RscS function. Substitu-tions within the carboxy-terminal domain supported identification of RscS as a hybrid sensor kinase; disrup-tion of both the HATPase and Rec domains eliminated induction of syp transcription, wrinkled colony morphology, pellicle formation, and <b>surface</b> <b>adherence,</b> while disruption of Hpt resulted in decreased activity. The PAS domain was also critical for RscS activity; substitutions in PAS resulted {{in a loss of}} activity. Generation of a cytoplasmic, N-terminal deletion derivative of RscS resulted in a partial loss of activity, suggesting a role for localization to the membrane and/or sequences within the TMR and PP domain. Finally, substitutions within the first transmembrane helix of the TMR and deletions within the PP domain both resulted in increased activity.

Data on on <b>adherence,</b> <b>quality</b> of life, attitude towards medication, side effects, symptom severity, and level of functioning at baseline and 1 -year follow-up were obtained from 373 participants in a multi-centre trial. Participants randomised to the intervention group were offered eight sessions of adherence therapy. Data were analysed via block recursive graphical modelling. Direct links between <b>adherence</b> and <b>quality</b> of life and effects across time were scarce and weak if present. However, indirect effects could be identified, i. e. adherence at baseline affected quality of life at follow-up via symptom severity and medication side effects. These findings underline associations between "traditional" clinical outcome parameters and <b>quality</b> of life. <b>Adherence</b> might have an impact on some of these clinical outcome dimensions, and this might indirectly affect quality of life across time.

40|$|In {{their natural}} environment, {{bacteria}} are often found as sessile populations, known as biofilms, typified by <b>surface</b> <b>adherence</b> and extracellular matrix production. This growth phase confers broad spectrum antibiotic recalcitrance, through undefined mechanisms. This work {{sought to investigate}} a role for increased mutability ofstaphylococci in biofilms, as a contributing mechanism in biofilm antibiotic recalcitrance. Initially, a novel biofilm model for use with staphylococci was established that utilised cellulose disks and incorporated human plasma to promote bacterial <b>surface</b> <b>adherence.</b> This system was validated by demonstrating antibiotic recalcitrance, dissemination by D-amino acids, and similarities with transcriptional profiles of other biofilm models. Using this novel biofilm model, and the Sorbarod flow system, mutation frequencies (MFs) were determined for Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis in biofilms and compared with those in planktonic cultures. This revealed increases in MF of up to 68 -fold compared with planktonic cultures. The role of oxidative stress in biofilm mutability was investigated by addition of antioxidants to biofilms. Here, MFs were reduced up to 5 -fold, suggesting a role for oxidative damage. Transcriptional profiling of biofilms revealed upregulation of several genes involved in DNA repair, compared with planktonic cultures. Genes encoding antioxidant activity were also investigated; of these only sodA was upregulated. Staphyloxanthin biosysthetic genes, however, were downregulated. During these studies, S. aureus biofilms were found to generate phenotypic variants. White variants (WVs) and large pale variants (LPVs) were mostly found amongst cells shed from biofilms. WVs had lost biofilm forming capacity and had mutations in the alternative sigma factor, SigB. LPVs retained biofilm forming capacity, but the genetic basis of their variation remains undefined. In summary, I have shown that staphylococci exhibit enhanced mutability in biofilms, accelerating the emergence of antibiotic resistance and morphological variants. This may result from oxidative stress, causing the enhanced accumulation of mutations within the genome...|$|R

There were no significant differences of BMQ screens and DQLCTQ functions between monotherapy and combination therapy groups (p>. 05). The BMQ screens’ score of combination therapy were higher than monotherapy groups.

40|$|Background: Coronary {{heart disease}} {{can have a}} long lasting impact on {{affected}} individuals {{in terms of both}} physical and psychological adjustment and quality of life. It is, therefore, important to investigate determinants of outcome in these patients. The thesis has four main aims; (i) to investigate predictors of outcome (<b>adherence,</b> <b>quality</b> of life, functional impairment, psychological distress and benefit finding) post-myocardial infarction (MI); (ii) to determine the prevalence and stability of Type D personality in the UK; (iii) to determine if personality predicts outcome after controlling for mood, demographic and clinical factors, and (iv) to investigate potential mechanisms which may explain the link between personality and poor prognosis in cardiac patients. Method: Five studies were conducted. In Studies 1 - 3, participants completed measures of Type D personality, health-related behaviour, social support and neuroticism. In Study 4, participants completed an experimental stressor with cardiovascular monitoring. Study 5 was a prospective study in which 131 MI patients completed measures of personality, illness cognitions and outcome at two time points, 3 - 5 days post-MI, then again 3 months later. Results: The prevalence of Type D personality in the UK is 39 % in the healthy population, and 34 % in the cardiac population. In addition, Type D is predictive of <b>adherence,</b> <b>quality</b> of life, and functional impairment in post-MI patients after controlling for mood, demographics, and clinical factors. Five possible mechanisms (health-related behaviour, adherence, social support, cardiovascular reactivity, and illness perceptions) by which Type D may lead to adverse outcome in cardiac patients were identified. Mood predicted quality of life and functional impairment post-MI, illness perceptions predicted quality of life post-MI, and future thinking predicted quality of life, functional impairment and depression post-MI. Discussion: These findings have important therapeutic and theoretical implications for understanding the role of personality and illness cognitions in the short-term recovery of post-MI patients.
