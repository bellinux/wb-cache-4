25|$|A sportier {{version of}} the 200B sedan was {{released}} in June 1978. The new SX featured a revised grille, front spoiler, alloy wheels, revised door and seat trim (striped <b>seat</b> <b>inserts)</b> and tachometer, while the suspension was altered to improve handling. The colours available for this model were simply blue, white or red, and the only transmission available was a 4-speed floor shift. Significantly the SX was a unique model to Australia, the added input from Nissan's Australian design engineers signified {{a step away from}} just assembling cars. This in turn led to the locally built Datsuns, and later Nissans, being re-engineered to better suit Australian conditions, with many components being sourced locally a tradition that would continue right up until 1992, when Nissan ceased local manufacture.|$|E
50|$|The valve {{is usually}} {{constructed}} as a circular poppet valve with a conical <b>seat,</b> <b>inserted</b> into the cylinder from the outside. A protrusion {{on the inside}} is hit by the piston as it approaches top dead centre, forcing the valve open.|$|R

2500|$|All 2,061 1975 Cosworth Vegas were {{finished}} in black acrylic lacquer with gold [...] "Cosworth Twin Cam" [...] lettering {{on the front}} fenders and rear cove panel and gold pinstriping on hood bulge, body sides, wheel openings, and rear cove. (Black was unavailable on other Vegas until mid-1976.) Most have black interiors. The custom interior with perforated vinyl seat trim (RPO ZJ1) was standard, with black cloth <b>seat</b> <b>inserts</b> a $50 option. About 16 percent had white vinyl interiors. All Cosworths had a gold-colored engine-turned dash bezel, gold-plated dash plaque with build sequence number, 8,000rpm tachometer, and Cosworth Twin-Cam Vega steering wheel emblem.|$|E
2500|$|A 1976 {{facelift}} included wider grill, tri-color {{tail lamps}} and extensive body anti-rust improvements. A new Borg-Warner five-speed manual overdrive transmission with 4.10 axle was optional. The exhaust system {{had a single}} tailpipe instead of 1975’s dual outlets. Seat trim changed to grained vinyl, and the optional extra-charge cloth trim <b>seat</b> <b>inserts</b> were changed to a [...] "houndstooth" [...] type named sport-cloth. In January, a [...] "Sky-Roof" [...] with tinted reflectorized sliding glass and 8-track tape player options were introduced. In February, eight 1976 Vega exterior colors were added: Antique White, Dark Blue Metallic, Firethorn Metallic, Mahogany Metallic, Dark Green Metallic, Buckskin, Medium Saddle Metallic, and Medium Orange; plus two additional interior colors, Firethorn and Buckskin. 1,447 1976 models were built. In November 1975, it had been decided to discontinue the car after the 1976 model year. Total production of 3,508 cars ended in July 1976 with a Medium Saddle Metallic model delivered to a Cleveland, Ohio dealer. 190,321 Vega hatchback coupes were produced in the same period.|$|E

40|$|A damaged {{cylinder}} {{head of a}} motorcycle containing two exhaust valves and two inlet valves was forwarded to the laboratory for analysis. Out of these four valves, one of the exhaust valves got fractured, while the other three valves (one exhaust and two inlet valves) were found bent to varying degree. The {{cylinder head}} was found severely mechanically damaged and cracked. Investigation revealed that the exhaust valve in question had failed by alternating bending fatigue leading to subsequent damages. The most probable reason for alternating bending stresses on the valve stem appears {{to be due to}} eccentricity in the guide and/or <b>seat</b> <b>insert.</b> No metallurgical abnormalities were found responsible for the fatigue failure of the valve...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A CAD/CAM {{system for}} {{manufacturing}} custom <b>seating</b> <b>inserts</b> was evaluated within a moderately to severely disabled population. Using the Otto Bock Shape System, 25 CAD/CAM seats were manufactured at a remote facility and compared to 9 seats manufactured using hand-sculpting techniques. Clinician and client questionnaires were com-pleted for each seat to assess satisfaction, fitting/manu-facturing times, and to collect demographic data. The CAD/CAM method was significantly better (p< 0. 05) than the hand-sculpting method {{in terms of}} on-site fabrication time. No {{significant differences were found}} for initial fitting time, final fitting time, clinician insert rating, and client satisfac-tion. These results support the CAD/CAM method as an effective and clinically efficient technique for making custom wheelchair seats. Key words: CAD/CAM, seating, wheelchair...|$|R

50|$|Aside from fashion designers, the {{automotive}} industry is a heavy user of ostrich leather. Car seats, dashboards, motorcycle seats, and door panels can all be covered or accented with ostrich leather.

50|$|Designed in the Adirondack style by Harrison G. Wiseman {{and built}} by George Locke of Bridgton, the theatre was {{constructed}} of rose hemlock harvested on the property. The proscenium arch {{was made from}} whole tree trunks and the beams, doors, trim, and light fixtures were all handcarved. The building was designed so the entire auditorium with its pitched floor could be detached from the stage end and moved forward allowing an extra section with more <b>seating</b> <b>inserted.</b> It boasted a thirty-member orchestra pit, stage dimensions identical to the Metropolitan Opera House, and the best technical equipment of any theatre outside of New York. Two large barn doors located behind the stage could be opened for an authentic forest backdrop. Whether by chance or design, the theatre also had near perfect acoustics. More than sixty years after the theatre first opened, Christopher Hyde, classical music critic for the Maine Sunday Telegram, theorized that the tight sheathing of rough hemlock and pre-stressed posts and beams created {{the effect of a}} large stringed instrument able to transmit vibrations efficiently without echoes or reverberation.|$|R

40|$|Valve wear {{has been}} a serious problem to engine {{designers}} and manufacturers for many years. Although new valve materials and production techniques are constantly being developed, these advances have been outpaced by demands for increased engine performance. The drive for reduced oil consumption and exhaust emissions, the phasing out of leaded petrol, reductions in the sulphur content of diesel fuel {{and the introduction of}} alternative fuels such as gas all have implications for valve and <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> wear. The aim of the project has been, {{through the use of a}} representative bench test and engine testing, to diagnose the predominant wear mechanisms in diesel engine inlet valves and seats. This information was then to be used with other test data to develop a model for predicting valve recession and other tools to assist in solving valve failure problems. Test apparatus has been developed that is capable of providing a simulation of the wear of both inlet valves and seats used in automotive diesel engines. Investigations carried out using the apparatus have shown that the valve and seat wear problem involves two distinct mechanisms; impact of the valve on the <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> on valve closure and sliding of the valve on the seat under the action of the combustion pressure. Wear has been shown to increase with valve closing velocity, combustion load and misalignment of the valve relative to the seat. Lubrication of the valve/seat interface leads to a significant reduction in valve recession. Valve rotation ensures even wear and promotes debris removal from the valve/seat interface. During testing it was established that resistance to impact was the key seat material property determining the amount of recession that occurred. A semi-empirical wear model for predicting valve recession has been developed based on the fundamental mechanisms of wear determined during test work. Model predictions were compared with engine tests and tests run on the bench test-rig. The model can be used to give a quantitative prediction of the valve recession to be expected with a particular material pair or a qualitative assessment of how parameters need to be altered in order to reduce recession. Flow charts have also been developed, based on the review of literature, failure analysis and modelling carried out, to assist in diagnosing and rectifying valve/seat failures and to help in reducing valve recession by design. The test apparatus, valve recession model and design tools can be integrated into an industrial environment in order to help reduce costs and timescales involved in solving valve/seat wear problems using the current trial and error methods...|$|R
