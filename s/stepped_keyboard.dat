50|$|The {{accordion}} {{was brought}} to Switzerland in the 1830s, soon after its invention in Vienna. The earliest accordions were the typically one- or two-row diatonic button accordions, which carried on in Switzerland as the Langnauerli, named for Langnau in canton Bern. The Langnauerli usually has one treble row of buttons and two bass/chord buttons on the left hand end, much like the accordion used in Cajun music (minus the stops), but is sometimes seen with 2 or 3 rows on a <b>stepped</b> <b>keyboard.</b> The Schwyzer√∂rgeli was a further development from the 1880s, with changes in the treble fingering and a flat keyboard (not stepped), and unisonoric basses.|$|E

Unlike OSC1, the second oscillator provides fine detune and coarse detune +-24 <b>steps,</b> and <b>keyboard</b> tracking may be disengaged. Oscillator 2 can be synced to Oscillator 1.|$|R

50|$|In 1901, Baudot's {{code was}} {{modified}} by Donald Murray (1865-1945), prompted by his {{development of a}} typewriter-like keyboard. The Murray system employed an intermediate <b>step,</b> a <b>keyboard</b> perforator, which allowed an operator to punch a paper tape, and a tape transmitter for sending the message from the punched tape. At {{the receiving end of}} the line, a printing mechanism would print on a paper tape, and/or a reperforator could be used to make a perforated copy of the message. As there was no longer a connection between the operator's hand movement and the bits transmitted, there was no concern about arranging the code to minimize operator fatigue, and instead Murray designed the code to minimize wear on the machinery, assigning the code combinations with the fewest punched holes to the most frequently used characters.|$|R
5000|$|For {{a project}} entitled, Make a Baby, Luke Fischbeck {{attached}} {{a number of}} wires together so that when two people hold two different wires and touch, it creates sound. The project {{was said to be}} [...] "like when Tom Hanks jumps on the <b>keyboard</b> <b>steps</b> in Big. Or {{when you go to the}} aquarium for the first time and you realize that's what a starfish feels like, self discovery, science and a taste of natural sorcery." ...|$|R
50|$|In Overture, {{input of}} note {{data can be}} done by any of several methods: QWERTY <b>keyboard,</b> mouse, <b>step</b> entry MIDI <b>keyboard</b> recording, or {{real-time}} MIDI keyboard recording. Most notational symbols can be repositioned simply by dragging them with the mouse. Most other editing of notational symbols is performed by selecting the symbols using the mouse, and selecting the appropriate editing command from a menu or by clicking on a palette. MIDI data is edited in a special graphical view, where each note appears as a bar on a piano roll. Editing is done simply by adjusting the bars by dragging with the mouse.|$|R
2500|$|OMD's {{experimental}} {{brand of}} synth-pop has garnered limited mainstream attention. The group generally eschew choruses, {{replacing them with}} synthesizer lines, and opt for unconventional lyrical subjects such as war and machinery; the BBC wrote that [...] "OMD were always more intellectual" [...] than [...] "contemporaries like Duran Duran and Eurythmics". The band also rejected celebrity status and strove [...] "to have no image". Despite the group's experimentation, they had an established knack for pop hooks; AllMusic critic Mike DeGagne wrote that OMD's music was [...] "a <b>step</b> above other <b>keyboard</b> pop music of the time, thanks to the combination of intelligently crafted hooks and colorful rhythms". DeGagne's colleague Jon O'Brien remarked that the outfit were [...] "ahead of their time".|$|R

A few of Baudot's codes moved to the positions where they have stayed ever since: the NULL or BLANK and the DEL code. NULL/BLANK was used as an idle code for when no messages were being sent.|$|R
5000|$|A few early-music {{ensembles}} of {{the present}} day must do something similar if they comprise some instruments tuned to A415 and others to A440, approximately a semitone apart. Modern builders of continuo instruments sometimes include moveable keyboards which can play with either pitch standard. The harpsichord has a single string for each note, plucked by a plectrum and the difference in pitch between the Baroque A at 415 Hz and the [...] "modern" [...] A at 440 Hz is one half <b>step.</b> Moving the <b>keyboard</b> mechanism right or left causes the A key to play the next string, namely the A at 440 Hz or the A at 392 Hz respectively. Movement of the keyboard allows one to play higher or lower, though your topmost or bottommost key will not produce sound unless the builder has provided extra strings to accommodate the transposition feature.|$|R
5000|$|Finally we {{just played}} England too many times. ...we {{had no more}} new material, we didn't have much else in common, and there was little {{prospect}} of improvement. So we just decided to round off our schedule and leave it at that. Sort of 'Call {{me if you can}} think of anything.' Stewart Copeland Citing dissatisfaction with BTM Records' inability to support Curved Air financially, Way departed. Though Alex Richman from the Butts Band <b>stepped</b> in on <b>keyboards,</b> the loss of the band's de facto leader was a blow. This line-up's last-ditch attempt at a hit single, a cover version of [...] "Baby Please Don't Go", was another flop. After months of gradually losing steam, Curved Air broke up so quietly that, by Sonja Kristina's recollections, most of the music press wrote off the band's absence as a [...] "sabbatical". Copeland formed The Police, Reeves returned to work as a producer and played in semi-pro band Big Chief along with Jacques, and Kristina and Way both pursued solo careers. Kristina and Copeland maintained the close personal relationship they'd formed while bandmates and were married in 1982.|$|R
40|$|Designing virtual {{keyboards}} {{adapted to}} the needs of upper limbs motor impairment for text input or application control command requires an integrated tool to design and evaluate it. There are platforms of virtual keyboard design. These platforms enable to design virtual keyboards for text input, environment control command but also application control application like Internet. Several studies have defined models and parameters to measure the performance of text entry. Some adjustments of Fitts' law have been proposed to consider the motor behavior of upper limbs motor impairment. This paper will describe the SOftware KEYboard TOolkit (SOKEYTO v 2). It is an upgrade of SOKEYTO v 1. Text entry and environment controls are available functionalities of software keyboards designed by (SOKEYTO v 2). SOKEYTO is the result of brainstorming sessions, review of related work on tools and test of current environment Clavicom NG, CiviKey. SOKEYTO v 2 is a complete tool: it enables to design, generate and evaluate software keyboards. The evaluation process {{is an integral part of}} SOKEYTO; then it is possible to measure the impact of the layout on speed rate, for example, at each design <b>step</b> of virtual <b>keyboard</b> SOKEYTO v 2 also allows the management of multi-layer of software keyboard; each layer could be customized. In regards to related work, SOKEYTO particularities are: predictive models adapted to motor impairment; possibility of customized keyboard layout and a program generator of software keyboard. Firstly, this paper will describe the method used to define the components of SOKEYTO and the characteristics of SOKEYTO with an emphasis on the SOKEYTO particularities. Then, we will report the predictive evaluation of software keyboards designed by the SOKEYTO platform...|$|R
