5|$|During {{his time}} at the USDA, Thom became a world {{authority}} on the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. Thom pioneered the technique of using defined, reproducible culture media to grow microorganisms; most of the taxa he described are still valid today. Together with Margaret B. Church, Thom maintained collections of fungus cultures for the American Type Culture Collection, established in 1925. In 1929, a year after discovering penicillin, Alexander Fleming published a well-known paper in which he identified the mold Penicillium rubrum as the one responsible for creating the drug. Harold Raistrick succeeded in growing the organism on a simple culture medium, but could not isolate the penicillin produced by the mold when grown this way. With Thom's assistance, they correctly identified the organism as Penicillium notatum and, in 1941, developed a method to <b>scale</b> <b>up</b> production at the Department of Agriculture's Northern Regional Research Laboratory in Peoria, Illinois, which ultimately resulted in an inexpensive supply of the drug.|$|E
5|$|The glass forms include {{borosilicate}} {{glasses and}} phosphate glasses. Borosilicate nuclear waste glasses are used on an industrial scale to immobilize high level radioactive waste {{in many countries}} which are producers of nuclear energy or have nuclear weaponry. The glass waste forms {{have the advantage of}} being able to accommodate a wide variety of waste-stream compositions, they are easy to <b>scale</b> <b>up</b> to industrial processing, and they are stable against thermal, radiative, and chemical perturbations. These glasses function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass-forming elements. Phosphate glasses while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution rates than borosilicate glasses, which make them a more favorable option. However, no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions. Both glasses have to be processed at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile radiotoxic elements.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To achieve population-wide health improvement, {{public health}} {{interventions}} found effective in selected samples {{need to be}} ‘scaled up’ and implemented more widely. The pathways through which interventions are <b>scaled</b> <b>up</b> are not well characterised. The aim {{of this paper is}} to identify examples of public health interventions which have been <b>scaled</b> <b>up</b> and to develop a conceptual framework which quantifies and describes this process. Methods A multi-stage international literature search was undertaken to identify examples of public health interventions in high income countries that have been <b>scaled</b> <b>up</b> or implemented at scale. Initial abstract review identified articles which met all the criteria of being a: 1) public health intervention; 2) chronic disease prevention focus; 3) program delivered at a wide geographical scale (state, national or international). Interventions were reviewed and coded into a conceptual framework pathway to document their <b>scaling</b> <b>up</b> process. For each program, an in-depth review of the identified articles was undertaken along with a broad internet based search to determine the outcomes of the dissemination process. A conceptual framework of <b>scaling</b> <b>up</b> pathways was developed that involved four stages (development, efficacy testing, real world trial and dissemination) to which the 40 programs were mapped. Results The search identified 40 public health interventions that showed evidence of being <b>scaled</b> <b>up.</b> Four pathways were identified to capture the different <b>scaling</b> <b>up</b> trajectories taken which included: ‘Type I – Comprehensive’ (55 %) which passed through all four stages, ‘Type II – Efficacy omitters’ (5 %) which did not conduct efficacy testing, ‘Type III – Trial omitters’ (25 %) which did not conduct a real world trial, and ‘Type IV – At scale dissemination’ (15 %) which skipped both efficacy testing and a real world trial. Conclusions This is the first study to classify and quantify the potential pathways through which public health interventions in high income countries are <b>scaled</b> <b>up</b> to reach the broader population. Mapping these pathways not only demonstrates the different trajectories that occur in <b>scaling</b> <b>up</b> public health interventions, but also allows the variation across <b>scaling</b> <b>up</b> pathways to be classified. The policy and practice determinants leading to each pathway remain for future study, especially to identify the conditions under which efficacy and replication stages are missing...|$|R

This study adopts a case study approach to understanding the issues of <b>scaling</b> <b>up</b> impact for a service-providing Nepalese non governmental organisation (NGO) engaged in the rural development sector, namely, ‘FORWARD’. Using participatory methods, the author captures the perceptions of NGO staff, donors and collaborating organisations in order to form a holistic overview of the NGO. Analysis of the NGO occurs at three levels, focusing on the organisation, programmes and the organisational network. The findings are juxtaposed against secondary sources in order to frame the NGO {{in the context of}} rural development and NGOs in Nepal. The author argues that there exists a wide range of qualitative and quantitative strategies with potential for <b>scaling</b> <b>up</b> impact.

40|$|For a {{successful}} introduction of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) {{it is important}} to determine (socio-economic) impacts and societal costs and benefits of these systems beforehand, and to develop business models. Governments usually make investment decisions based on these aspects. In the field of ITS tools exist for the separate parts of this analysis, but an integrated tool that combines impact assessment, cost benefit analysis and business modelling is lacking. A crucial step in such an integrated tool is scaling up: translating small scale traffic effects to large scale societal benefits. Traffic effects are usually determined in an experiment, for example a Field Operational Test or micro simulation, for scenarios limited in time and geographical scale. A societal cost benefit analysis demands results on for example country or EU level, for a whole year. In practice little attention is paid to the methodology for <b>scaling</b> <b>up.</b> In the European project ITS Test Beds TNO has developed a practical methodology for <b>scaling</b> <b>up,</b> integrating the tools for micro simulation and cost benefit analysis using statistics.
