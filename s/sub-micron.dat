25|$|Optical traps {{are very}} {{sensitive}} instruments and are capable of the manipulation and detection of sub-nanometer displacements for <b>sub-micron</b> dielectric particles. For this reason, they are often used to manipulate and study single molecules by interacting with a bead that has been attached to that molecule. DNA and the proteins and enzymes that interact with it are commonly studied in this way.|$|E
25|$|With {{high speed}} data acquisition, and <b>sub-micron</b> resolution, OCT is {{adaptable}} to perform both inline and off-line. Due {{to the high}} volume of produced pills, an interesting field of application is in the pharmaceutical industry to control the coating of tablets. Fiber-based OCT systems are particularly adaptable to industrial environments. These can access and scan interiors of hard-to-reach spaces, {{and are able to}} operate in hostile environments—whether radioactive, cryogenic, or very hot. Novel optical biomedical diagnostic and imaging technologies are currently being developed to solve problems in biology and medicine.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{municipal}} incinerator designs {{include a}} high-temperature zone, where the flue gas is sustained at a temperature above [...] {{for at least}} 2 seconds before it is cooled down. They are equipped with auxiliary heaters to ensure this at all times. These are often fueled by oil or natural gas, and are normally only active for a very {{small fraction of the}} time. Further, most modern incinerators utilize fabric filters (often with Teflon membranes to enhance collection of <b>sub-micron</b> particles) which can capture dioxins present in or on solid particles.|$|E
2500|$|The E Ring is {{the second}} {{outermost}} ring and is extremely wide; it consists of many tiny (micron and <b>sub-micron)</b> particles of water ice with silicates, carbon dioxide and ammonia. [...] The E Ring is distributed between the orbits of Mimas and Titan. Unlike the other rings, it is composed of microscopic particles rather than macroscopic ice chunks. In 2005, {{the source of the}} E Ring's material was determined to be cryovolcanic plumes emanating from the [...] "tiger stripes" [...] of the south polar region of the moon Enceladus. Unlike the main rings, the E Ring is more than 2,000km thick and increases with its distance from Enceladus. Tendril-like structures observed within the E Ring can be related to the emissions of the most active south polar jets of Enceladus.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, there are {{suggestions}} that surges of activity {{occurred in the}} later stages of the volcanism and associated continental rifting. Intrusions of hot magma into carbon-rich sediments may have triggered the degassing of isotopically light methane in sufficient volumes to cause global warming and the observed isotope anomaly. This hypothesis is documented {{by the presence of}} extensive intrusive sill complexes and thousands of kilometer-sized hydrothermal vent complexes in sedimentary basins on the mid-Norwegian margin and west of Shetland. [...] Volcanic eruptions of a large magnitude can impact global climate, reducing the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface, lowering temperatures in the troposphere, and changing atmospheric circulation patterns. [...] Large-scale volcanic activity may last only a few days, but the massive outpouring of gases and ash can influence climate patterns for years. [...] Sulfuric gases convert to sulfate aerosols, <b>sub-micron</b> droplets containing about 75 percent sulfuric acid. Following eruptions, these aerosol particles can linger as long as three to four years in the stratosphere.|$|E
2500|$|A 2005 {{work has}} shown that the slip is a matrix of mainly silicon and {{aluminium}} oxides, within which are suspended sub-microscopic crystals of haematite and corundum. The matrix itself does not contain any metallic ions, the haematite is substituted in aluminium and titanium while the corundum is substituted in iron. The two crystal populations are homogenously dispersed within the matrix. [...] The colour of haematite depends on the crystal size. Large crystals of this mineral are black but as the size decreases to <b>sub-micron</b> the colour shifts to red. The fraction of aluminium has a similar effect. It was formerly thought that the difference between 'red' and 'black' samian was due to the presence (black) or absence (red) of reducing gases from the kiln and that the construction of the kiln was so arranged as to prevent the reducing gases from the fuel from coming into contact with the pottery. The presence of iron oxides in the clay/slip was thought to be reflected in the colour according to the oxidation state of the iron (Fe for the red and Fe for the black, the latter produced by the reducing gases coming into contact with the pottery during firing). It now appears {{as a result of this}} recent work that this is not the case and that the colour of the glossy slip is in fact due to no more than the crystal size of the minerals dispersed within the matrix glass.|$|E

50|$|Static CMOS gates {{are very}} power {{efficient}} because they dissipate nearly zero power when idle. Earlier, the power consumption of CMOS devices {{was not the}} major concern while designing chips. Factors like speed and area dominated the design parameters. As the CMOS technology moved below <b>sub-micron</b> levels the power consumption per unit area of the chip has risen tremendously.|$|E
50|$|Quilt Packaging (QP) is an {{integrated}} circuit packaging and chip-to-chip interconnect technology that incorporates conductive “nodules” fabricated {{on the sides}} of chips. These nodule structures function as extremely wide bandwidth, low-loss electrical I/O, with <b>sub-micron</b> mechanical chip-to-chip alignment.

50|$|The unique {{characteristic}} of FluidFM {{is that it}} introduces microscopic channels into AFM probes. Those channels can have an aperture of less than 300 nm, or 500 times thinner than a human hair. This nanometric features enables the handling of liquid volumes at the femtoliter (fL) scale as well as force controlled manipulations of <b>sub-micron</b> objects. Via the nanofluidic channels, substances can for example be inserted into single cells or cells can be isolated from a confluent layer.|$|E
5000|$|For {{particulate}} matter emissions, e-cigarettes slightly exceeded the WHO guidelines, but emissions were 15 times less than traditional cigarette use. In January 2014, the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease stated [...] "Adverse health effects for exposed third parties (second-hand exposure) {{cannot be excluded}} because the use of electronic cigarettes leads to emission of fine and ultrafine inhalable liquid particles, nicotine and cancer-causing substances into indoor air." [...] The dense vapor consists of liquid <b>sub-micron</b> droplets.|$|E
50|$|The Hall-Petch method, or grain {{boundary}} strengthening, is to obtain small grains. Smaller grains {{increases the likelihood}} of dislocations running into grain boundaries after shorter distances, which are very strong dislocation barriers. In general, smaller grain size will make the material harder. When the grain size approach <b>sub-micron</b> sizes, some materials may however become softer. This is simply an effect of another deformation mechanism that becomes easier, i.e. {{grain boundary}} sliding. At this point, all dislocation related hardening mechanisms become irrelevant.|$|E
50|$|Varieties of SECM {{employing}} the micropipet tip geometry {{have been used}} to generate spatially resolved microcrystals of a solid solution. Here, glass microcapillaries with <b>sub-micron</b> sized orifices replace the standard UME allowing femtoliter-sized droplets to be suspended from the capillary over a conductive surface acting as the working electrode. Upon contact with the positively biased surface, the droplets of salt solutions achieve supersaturation and crystallize with well-defined, microscale geometries. Such technology could lend itself well to solid-state electrochemical sensors on microdevices.|$|E
50|$|Synchrotron X-rays can be {{used for}} {{traditional}} X-ray imaging, phase-contrast X-ray imaging, and tomography. The Ångström-scale wavelength of X-rays enables imaging well below the diffraction limit of visible light, but practically the smallest resolution so far achieved is about 30 nm. Such nanoprobe sources are used for scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM). Imaging can be combined with spectroscopy such as X-ray fluorescence or X-ray absorption spectroscopy in order to map a sample's chemical composition or oxidation state with <b>sub-micron</b> resolution.|$|E
50|$|E-cigarettes produce particles, in {{the form}} of an aerosol. In physics, a vapor is a {{substance}} in the gas phase whereas an aerosol is a suspension of tiny particles of liquid, solid or both within a gas. The aerosol is made-up of liquid <b>sub-micron</b> particles of condensed vapor, which mostly consist of propylene glycol, glycerol, water, flavorings, nicotine, and other chemicals. This aerosol that is produces resembles cigarette smoke. After a puff, inhalation of the aerosol travels from the device into the mouth and lungs.|$|E
50|$|Special micropipettes and nanopipettes {{are used}} as FluidFM probes with {{openings}} between 300 nm and 8 μm. A larger diameter is helpful for single cell adhesion experiments, whereas a smaller diameter provides good opportunities for nanolithography and handling of <b>sub-micron</b> objects. Compared to the traditional glass micropipettes FluidFM probes are much more gentle to soft samples such as cells. They can be controlled with pN and nm precision, and handle volumes more precise and consistent due to their wafer-based fabrication process. FluidFM has unique advantages for single cell applications and beyond.|$|E
