40|$|Murraya koenigii is {{a medium}} size, ever green plant {{which has been}} {{utilized}} {{as a source of}} food, medicine, and other agricultural purposes in different communities. Thus, the preliminary phytochemical analysis and TLC separation was done using methanol, n-hexane, and ethyl acetate(1 : 3 : 1), as solvent system while iodine vapour as <b>spotting</b> <b>agent.</b> The phytochemical screening of diethyl ether extracts of bark revealed the presence of carbohydrates, anthraquinones glycosides,saponins,flavanoids, and alkaloids, while chloroform extracts of bark revealed carbohydrates, tannins, saponins, and alkaloids, while acetone extracts of bark revealed the presence of carbohydrates, anthraquinones glycosides, flavanoids and alkaloids,while ethanol extracts of bark revealed the presence of carbohydrates, tannins, anthraquinones glycosides,s aponins, flavanoids and alkaloids. TLC separation showed (3) spots each of Diethyl Ether, Chloroform, Acetone, Ethanol from bark extracts. From our findings, it can be concluded that Murraya Koenigii contains some significant phytochemicals that can exhibit desired therapeutic activities such as Antioxidant, Anti-Microbial, Anti-Fungal, Anti-Diabetic, Anti-Ulcer and Cosmetic use. However, {{there is a need to}} conduct further Pharmaceutical Analysis on test extracts in order to establish these biomedical applications.

40|$|Dyeing and Cleaning gave {{an account}} of a servant in the {{household}} of Jean-Baptiste Jolly in Paris in 1825 who spilled {{the contents of a}} lamp on a soiled tabrecloth. When the tablecloth dried, the spots had disappeared. The liquid in the lamp was probably camphene, produced from pinene, which is the main ingredient of turpentine. Camphene was initially used as a <b>spotting</b> <b>agent,</b> but it was later used for complete cleaning by hand. Use of volatile organic liquids to clean cloths became known as 'French cleaning ' in Scotland and 'chemical cleaning ' in Germany (Michelsen, 1957). Eventually, such processes were called 'dry cleaning ' because they do not involve the use of water. The corn mon cleaning practice of early dyers and cleaners was to scour, using soap and water, and to add various acids and alkalis to the rinse. ln the 1 840 s, garments were sometimes sponged inside and out with water and ox gall; dark clothes were sponged with water and logwood. A formulation for removing grease spots comprised fuller's earth, French chalk, yellow soap, pearlash and turpentine. When white fabrics became too soiled to be cleaned, they were dyed a darker col our. The early dry cleaning operation consisted of four steps: dustin...|$|E

40|$|Sugar beet hybrids {{value as}} well as their {{tolerance}} to the leaf <b>spot</b> <b>agent</b> (Cercospora beticola Sacc.) were researched in the natural infection conditions with and without fungicides application on two locations (Topolje, Seleš) in the two year period (2004, 2005). Evaluation has been done via root yield and quality, sugar yield {{as well as}} visual leaf damage estimation. The research comprised 26 sorts as either widely used in practice or to be introduced. The investigated sorts showed insufficient tolerance to C. beticola Sacc. Thus, fungicide application, compared to untreated trials, resulted in increased mean root yield by 11. 07 t/ha (14. 8 %), sugar content by 1. 00 % (relative 7. 1 %) and sugar yield by 2. 08 t/ha (23. 0 %). The trials with fungicide application were characterized by the highest mean root yield obtained with the Libero hybrid (98. 49 t/ha), sugar concentration with the Iris sort (16. 23 %) and sugar yield with the Merak hybrid (12. 67 t/ha) ...|$|R

50|$|Milo is an {{independent}} technological contractor, brought in to CTU {{to work on a}} key card that was left by now dead agent Richard Walsh. The key card contains information regarding the assassination plot against Senator David Palmer. When first introduced, Milo joins CTU to break into the keycard, but before he can do so, Jack Bauer is forced to switch the key card with a fake one for villain Ira Gaines. Milo then figures out that he has been working with a different key card, and he suspects that Jack may have switched it when he came to his desk. After Jamey Farrell is revealed as a mole, agent Nina Myers has Milo research Gaines’ identity, putting Milo in charge of all Jamey’s projects. Although Milo has narrowed the missing Teri Bauer's location down, it is still too large of an area to pinpoint the exact <b>spot.</b> <b>Agent</b> Tony Almeida finds an encrypted email on Jamey's computer and has Milo decode it. Milo then looks to find the remaining shooters. At CTU, Milo briefs Jack about the three possible shooters he uncovered. One of them is Alexis, Victor Drazen's son who had been trained in Belgrade’s special forces. Milo forwards the photos of the suspected assassins to the Secret Service, and Agent Pierce shows them to the assembled Palmer campaign team. When Jack becomes suspicious of another mole being in CTU, he asks Milo to watch the servers for any classified information being leaked. Milo's last act for the day was notifying Jack that Robert Ellis (the connection between Bauer and Palmer to Operation Nightfall) was found murdered in New Orleans.|$|R
