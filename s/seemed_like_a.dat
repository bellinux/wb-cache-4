5|$|The {{blue whale}} rose from {{relative}} obscurity in the 1970s, {{after the release}} of the Songs of the Humpback Whale. The difference between the humpback and the blue whale was not well known to most people, who conflated the species in their minds. To many listeners, the haunting songs <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cry for help. Environmentalists developed the image of a lonely blue whale singing out in an empty ocean, since whalers had nearly hunted the species to extinction.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Cleave's article {{appeared}} in the Evening Standard, Beatles press officer Tony Barrow offered Datebook, a US teen magazine, rights to all four interviews. Barrow believed the pieces were important to show fans that the Beatles were progressing beyond simple pop music and producing more intellectually challenging work. As Datebook was a socially progressive magazine that addressed subjects such as interracial dating and legalization of marijuana, it <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> suitable vehicle to carry this information.|$|E
5|$|In Cesena in 1502, Leonardo {{entered the}} service of Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI, acting as a {{military}} architect and engineer and travelling throughout Italy with his patron. Leonardo created a map of Cesare Borgia's stronghold, a town plan of Imola {{in order to win}} his patronage. Maps were extremely rare at the time and it would have <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> new concept. Upon seeing it, Cesare hired Leonardo as his chief military engineer and architect. Later in the year, Leonardo produced another map for his patron, one of Chiana Valley, Tuscany, so as to give his patron a better overlay of the land and greater strategic position. He created this map in conjunction with his other project of constructing a dam from the sea to Florence, in order to allow a supply of water to sustain the canal during all seasons.|$|E

5|$|Solo {{was born}} in Richland, Washington on July 30, 1981 to Judy Lynn (née Shaw) and Jeffrey Solo. Her father, an Italian-American Vietnam War veteran, who {{was in and out}} of her life as a child and teenager, taught her how to play soccer at a young age. When Solo was seven, her father picked her and her brother Marcus up to go to a {{baseball}} game in the nearby city of Yakima, but ended up driving over three hours west to Seattle, where they stayed for several days at a hotel. Solo described how it <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> vacation at first, but soon realized it was not. Police later found them at a downtown bank and arrested Jeffrey for alleged kidnapping. Although her parents had divorced when she was six and she lived with her mother, Solo maintained a close relationship with her father after reconnecting with him during her college years at the University of Washington. He continued to be a major influence in her life until his death of a heart attack in June 2007.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the time}} of the 35th annual March for Life in 2008, a Guttmacher Institute report was released, which {{revealed}} that the number of abortions performed in the United States dropped to 1.2 million in 2005. This was the lowest level of abortions since 1976. Although this <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> victory, many march participants stressed that the figures were not a large enough decline. Many marchers said they would not stop protesting until abortions were illegal.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the idea}} of doing a {{straight}} re-release of the game initially <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> straight-forward task, the implementation proved somewhat more complicated, due to the different architectures of a PC and a DS. For example, to get the graphics to look identical to their 1996 incarnation, they had to be completely rewritten for the new device; behind the replication of the original's 2D isometric graphics, a 3D game engine is running, which must convert the graphics in real time.|$|E
25|$|James {{also created}} a large {{standing}} army and employed Catholics {{in positions of power}} within it. To his opponents in Parliament this <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> prelude to arbitrary rule, so James prorogued Parliament without gaining Parliament's consent. At this time, the English regiments of the army were encamped at Hounslow, near the capital. It was feared that the location was intended to overawe the City. The army in Ireland was purged of Protestants, who were replaced with Catholics, and by 1688 James had more than 34,000 men under arms in his three kingdoms.|$|E

25|$|The 1977–78 season, however, {{proved to}} be one that the club would prefer to forget. From what <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> safe mid-table {{position}} in March, Blackpool won only one of their final sixteen games and were relegated to Division Three, by one point, {{for the first time}} in their 91-year history. Brown had been sacked in February, with the club in ninth place and having scored ten goals in their previous two home games, and it was left to Jimmy Meadows once more to pick up the pieces for the remaining three months of the campaign.|$|E
25|$|At {{first this}} <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> victory for Augustenburg, but Bismarck soon removed him from power {{by making a}} series of {{unworkable}} demands, namely that Prussia should have control over the army and navy of the duchies. Originally, it had been proposed that the Diet of the German Confederation, {{in which all the}} states of Germany were represented, should determine the fate of the duchies; but before this scheme could be effected, Bismarck induced Austria to agree to the Gastein Convention. Under this agreement signed 20 August 1865, Prussia received Schleswig, while Austria received Holstein. In that year he was given the title of Graf (Count) von Bismarck-Schönhausen.|$|E

After the 2002–03 season, St. Jean's earlier mistakes of committing money to players like Danny Fortson, Adonal Foyle and Erick Dampier were painfully felt by Warriors' fans when the team was unable to re-sign Arenas despite his desire to stay in the Bay Area. A new rule was implemented in response to second-round draft picks who quickly become superstars.|$|E
25|$|Social {{activism}} {{had existed}} in Eugene {{prior to the}} mall's opening, and it had both a loyal following and an infrastructure. When Eugene acquired a large, landscaped, outdoor public-use venue with convenient public transportation, it seemed in fulfillment of deeply held social needs that were not dependent upon retail sales. People angry about the Vietnam War gathered on the mall. The mall was an ongoing location for counter-cultural activity. Retail customers experienced unhappiness at the widening generation gap. When Springfield Creamery owner Chuck Kesey, brother of author Ken Kesey, brought the Grateful Dead to the Oregon Renaissance Faire to play a benefit concert for the creamery in 1972, the Eugene Mall <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> good waiting room for the next concert. That concert did not occur until 1982.|$|E
25|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A- grade, saying: What’s most {{striking}} about “No Sanctuary,” {{apart from its}} attempts at thematic resonance, is how quickly and brutally the question of Terminus is resolved. If you’d asked me beforehand, I would’ve guessed {{that it would take}} {{at least a couple of}} episodes before Rick and the others could free themselves. I wouldn’t have been exactly excited about that, because the longer you stay in a community full of murderous cannibals without any major character being killed, the more the tension just drips away, but it <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> reasonable assumption to make, especially when taking into consideration how tricky it was going to be to build the rest of the season. Without the prison home base or an obvious major villain (goodbye, the Governor), we need something to create structure—a group of psychos who harvest human flesh seems like too good a concept to dispose of immediately.|$|E

25|$|The {{season was}} {{made all the}} more special {{following}} Shawn Redhage's announcement that the 2016/17 season would be his last in the NBL. When Redhage announced his retirement in January 2017, it would have taken a brave soul to predict his last act as a Wildcat would be cutting down the net at Perth Arena. At that time, the Wildcats were sitting on a shaky record of 12 wins and 12 losses and were sitting outside of the top-four. Missing the finals {{for the first time in}} 31 years <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> real possibility. However, an inspired Perth Wildcats side took to the court in February and finished the season on a seven-game streak. The run of form came at the perfect time, as the Wildcats surged towards the 2017 title, with Redhage's final game seeing him become a four-time championship player. In addition to his six club MVP awards, Redhage departed the NBL as one of the Wildcats' all-time great players. Redhage finished his illustrious NBL career with 393 games to his name—380 with the Perth Wildcats (second on the team's all-time games-played list)—while finishing with 5,819 points and 2,153 rebounds.|$|E
25|$|Since the MNF {{schedule}} {{is set in}} April and cannot be changed, the league and network cannot guarantee a late season matchup will have any significance or be highly anticipated. Teams thought to be good during the off-season could be out of playoff contention {{by the middle of}} the season; a prime example occurred in 1999, when the San Francisco 49ers and Atlanta Falcons both entered the season's final MNF game with 4–11 records. It had <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> good pre-season matchup since the Falcons had played in the previous season's Super Bowl and the 49ers coming into the 1999 season had posted 16 consecutive 10-win seasons. It is also possible for a team like the 1999 St. Louis Rams not to be scheduled for a Monday night game because of its dismal record the year before, and many other NFL teams (such as the 2004 San Diego Chargers, with zero primetime games) have had huge unforeseen turnarounds that result in lack of MNF attention (these teams generally receive multiple MNF spots the year after their breakout success, which is great for viewers if those teams continue to play well, and not so great if they return to mediocrity or worse). However, the forecasting abilities of the NFL's scheduling officials have exhibited uncanny proficiency. Many MNF games occurring later in the season feature at least one team that is either headed to the playoffs or must win the MNF game to clinch a playoff spot.|$|E
