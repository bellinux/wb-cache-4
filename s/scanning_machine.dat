25|$|In {{some ways}} {{similar to the}} laser {{turntable}} is the IRENE <b>scanning</b> <b>machine</b> for disc records, which images with microphotography in two dimensions, invented {{by a team of}} physicists at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories. IRENE will retrieve the information from a laterally modulated monaural grooved sound source without touching the medium itself, but cannot read vertically modulated information. This excludes grooved recordings such as cylinders and some radio transcriptions that feature a hill-and-dale format of recording, and stereophonic or quadraphonic grooved recordings, which utilize {{a combination of the two}} as well as supersonic encoding for quadraphonic.|$|E

50|$|Unexpected {{capabilities}} of these associative relationships {{have led to}} a new form of prototyping called digital prototyping. In contrast to physical prototypes, which entail manufacturing time in the design.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{familiar}} applications of optical mark recognition {{is the use of}} #2 pencil (HB in Europe) bubble optical answer sheets in multiple choice question examinations. Students mark their answers, or other personal information, by darkening circles marked on a pre-printed sheet. Afterwards the sheet is automatically graded by a <b>scanning</b> <b>machine.</b> In the United States and most European countries, a horizontal or vertical 'tick' in a rectangular 'lozenge' is the most commonly used type of OMR form, the most familiar application being the UK National lottery form. Lozenge marks are a later technology and have the advantage of being easier to mark and easier to erase. The large 'bubble' marks are legacy technology from the very early OMR machines that were so insensitive a large mark was required for reliability. In most Asian countries, a special marker is used to fill in an optical answer sheet. Students, likewise mark answers or other information via darkening circles marked on a pre-printed sheet. Then the sheet is automatically graded by a <b>scanning</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E

40|$|CT. Scan {{examinations}} cause high patient {{absorbed dose}} from x-ray ionizing radiation. Therefore {{it is necessary}} to obtain superficial dose profile in Z-line. In this research 11 thermoluminecent dosimeter (TLD), after calibration were located on Z line perpendicular to slice thickness. CT. <b>Scan</b> <b>machines</b> did X-ray exposures. The resultant dose profiles showed gussian shape apperience, which has severed dose reduction off the slice thickness.

50|$|In 2016 a {{theoretical}} team from MIT devised a possible way of detecting axions using a strong magnetic field.

The experiment is now being implemented by experimentalists at the university. Another approach being used by the University of Washington uses a strong magnetic field to detect the possible weak conversion of axions to microwaves.|$|E

50|$|Aspen's first {{elections}} with IRV and the {{new city}} council system were on May 5, 2009. The number of voters was {{the highest in the}} history of Aspen elections. Mick Ireland was re-elected as mayor in the fourth round of a four-candidate race. Both city council incumbents were defeated in the two-seat IRV election in which nine candidates participated. The winners were selected after IRV tallies. 168 spoiled ballots were recast by voters alerted to errors by their optical <b>scanning</b> <b>machine.</b> The city reported 0% invalid ballots in the mayor's race and 0.9% invalid ballots in the two-seat city council elections.|$|E

50|$|Paper {{documents}} are turned into high-resolution digital images {{with the help}} of <b>scanning</b> <b>machines.</b> Different types of documents impose various constraints on the type of <b>scanning</b> <b>machines</b> that can be used and on the speed at which a document can be scanned. In partnership with industry, EPFL is working on a semi-automatic, robotic scanning unit capable of digitizing about 1000 pages per hour. Multiple units of this kind will be built to create an efficient digitization pipeline adapted to ancient documents. Another solution currently being explored at EPFL involves scanning books without turning the pages at all. This technique uses X-ray synchrotron radiation produced by a particle accelerator.|$|R

50|$|In 2012, anthropologists began {{scanning}} {{a replica}} skull of Magdalenian Girl {{to create a}} high resolution digital model. In order to do this, they used a high quality x-ray <b>scanning</b> <b>machine</b> to produce a CT scan, which recorded images of the skull from multiple angles. The digital reconstruction took place at Alloyweld Inspection Company. Unfortunately, when these remains were originally found, the archaeologists had accidentally shattered the skull with a pickaxe and had to piece it back together. Before the scanning process, the skull was in at least six pieces and was inexpertly put back together. This {{makes it difficult for}} anthropologists to understand what Magdalenian Girl looked like and to answer important questions about the remains.|$|E
50|$|The Foundation {{actively}} digitises materials {{connected to}} the leadership history of the country. These materials include speeches, books, news clippings, magazine articles, videos and audio tapes. It collaborates with the National Archives and the National Library to digitise these institutions' holdings (with a copy handed back to the source institution) and seeks to take this initiative nationwide to centralise and digitise materials of historical import. To date, the Foundation has digitised {{more than three hundred}} thirty thousand documents, equivalent to more than eight million pages, consisting of speeches of former PMs, news clippings, journal articles, and Parliamentary Hansards. In terms of technology, the Foundation has invested in a book <b>scanning</b> <b>machine,</b> OCR software and an upgraded search engine to enable more efficient research.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{personalized}} stamps - {{also known}} as customized postage - are technically a form of meter labels and are governed by the United States Postal Service. As [...] "a form of meter labels", they are not supposed ("they are not required") to be cancelled for postal purposes. Instead, a <b>scanning</b> <b>machine</b> {{at the post office}} is supposed to scan and void the postal value of that personalized stamp. For philatelic purposes, the postmarking of a personalized stamp is permitted, and it is harmless to USPS. In fact, a visible postmark is a further protection of revenue for USPS, since a postmarked personalized stamp is far less likely to be re-affixed on a mail piece for another mailing. While consumers may find that customized postage is available in a number of retail and online outlets, the USPS has authorized different companies to handle selected aspects of the program.|$|E

50|$|Today, if {{some common}} citizen, {{who does not}} have {{connections}} or is not rich, wants to spread information to the masses, (s)he has to approach the mainstream media. But to put any article in a good newspaper or TV channel requires lot of money or connections, which the common citizen does not have. The mainstream media is owned by {{only a handful of people}} and extremely few people can reach the masses and meagre dominate the society.But if the common citizens have right to get their affidavit scanned onto Prime Minister's website or any other specified central government public website by going to any of the 700 district collector offices, the application will come `as it is` and common citizens can reach the masses. In this way, the monopoly of few people in society will break. If any government officer tries to manipulate the affidavit, he/she will be exposed to crores with proof.As of today, collector office in every district has all the facilities - <b>scanning</b> <b>machine,</b> internet, magistrate to verify the affidavit filer`s name, staff to scan and put the affidavit on PM website etc.|$|E
