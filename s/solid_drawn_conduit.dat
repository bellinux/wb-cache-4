40|$|In the spunbonding process, the {{air flow}} {{field of the}} <b>drawing</b> <b>conduit</b> affects the polymer drawing and {{therefore}} the filament diameter greatly. Effects of the con-duit parameters on the air flow field are studied using the previously established air flow field model. The results show that longer narrow section, longer con-tracting section and larger height of narrow entry are of benefit to increasing the air velocity, thus helpful for decreasing the filament diameter.

50|$|The British Rail Class 109 is a {{class of}} 2-car diesel {{multiple}} units built in 1957 by D Wickham & Co. Five two-car units were built featuring an unusual body design. The design, first used in 1936 for South American railways, aimed to minimise weight. It had no underframe, but the whole body was formed into a welded stress-bearing box girder made of 1/8 in <b>solid</b> <b>drawn</b> steel tube. Aluminium was used for panels, luggage racks, window frames, vacuum pipes and fuel and vacuum tanks. The corrugated steel floor was filled with sprayed asbestos and covered with asbestos-filled flame-proofed hardboard and rubber sheet.|$|R

Delville was a respected Academic art teacher.

2500|$|The {{principle}} of <b>solid</b> <b>drawing</b> means {{taking into account}} forms in three-dimensional space, or giving them volume and weight. [...] The animator {{needs to be a}} skilled artist and has to understand the basics of three-dimensional shapes, anatomy, weight, balance, light and shadow, etc. For the classical animator, this involved taking art classes and doing sketches from life. One thing in particular that Johnston and Thomas warned against was creating [...] "twins": characters whose left and right sides mirrored each other, and looked lifeless. Modern-day computer animators draw less because of the facilities computers give them, yet their work benefits greatly from a basic understanding of animation principles, and their additions to basic computer animation.|$|R

The COF is based on hydrazone-linked functionalized triazine and phenyl building blocks and adopts a layered structure with a honeycomb-type lattice featuring mesopores of 3. 8 nm and the highest surface area among all hydrazone-based COFs reported to date. When illuminated with visible light, the COF continuously produces hydrogen from water without signs of degradation. With their precise molecular organization and modular structure combined with high porosity, photoactive COFs represent well-defined model systems to study and adjust the molecular entities central to the photocatalyic process.

40|$|Submicrometer fibers of {{polyaniline}} (PAni) doped with (+) -camphor- 10 -sulfonic acid (HCSA) and {{blended with}} poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) or poly(ethylene oxide) were electrospun over {{a range of}} compositions. Continuous, pure PAni fibers doped with HCSA were also produced by coaxial electrospinning and subsequent removal of the PMMA shell polymer. The electrical conductivities of both the fibers and the mats were characterized. The electrical conductivities of the fibers were found to increase exponentially with the weight percent of doped PAni in the fibers, with values as high as 50 ± 30 S/cm for as-electrospun fibers of 100 % doped PAni and as high as 130 ± 40 S/cm upon further <b>solid</b> state <b>drawing.</b> These high electrical conductivities are attributed to the enhanced molecular orientation arising from extensional deformation in the electrospinning process and afterward during <b>solid</b> state <b>drawing.</b> A model is proposed that permits the calculation of mat conductivity {{as a function of}} fiber conductivity, mat porosity, and fiber orientation distribution; the results agree quantitatively with the independently measured mat conductivities.

While the Gamblers had been a <b>solid</b> <b>draw</b> the year before, area fans were not about to abandon the Houston Oilers. Attendance dropped by almost 9,000 from 1984. The {{resulting}} financial problems were so severe that at one point, the Gamblers had trouble making payroll. They needed an advance from the league just to go to the playoffs. Facing an expensive move to the fall and knowing they could not hope to compete with the Oilers, owner Jerry Argovitz and his partners decided to get out. After briefly entertaining an offer to move to New York City, they agreed to sell the Gamblers' assets to New Jersey Generals owner Donald Trump for an undisclosed amount. Since the deal included the Gamblers' player contracts, it was widely reported as a merger. Trump immediately hired Pardee as coach. With an offense boasting Kelly and Walker, observers dubbed the new Generals the USFL's [...] "dream team." [...] Kelly was even featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated in a Generals uniform.
