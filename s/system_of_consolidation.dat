He devised an ingenious <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> of revenues, which rendered {{the international}} commission acceptable and useful to Greece, and he won a high place in the affections of the people throughout the country. While engaged on the business he was created a K.C.M.G. in May 1898, and given the rank of resident minister in the diplomatic service. He declined the Grand Cross of the Grecian Order of the Saviour and other foreign decorations. At the close of 1898 he went to Constantinople to represent British, Belgian, and Dutch bondholders on the council of the Ottoman debt.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} profit-shifting {{activities}} exist for multi-jurisdictional enterprises (MJEs) under a tax <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> and formula apportionment (FA). A theoretical model discusses how a MJE can exploit strategically {{its impact on}} the definition of the consolidated group. The analysis shows that the MJE will not consolidate if intra-group tax-rate differences — and thereby potential gains from profit shifting — are large. We test this prediction using confidential firm-level tax-return data for the local business tax in Germany. The identification strategy exploits a quasi-experiment derived from a major company tax reform in 2001 that significantly reduced the costs associated with separating out individual affiliates. Our results show that, evaluated at the sample mean, an increase in the tax-rate variance among a MJE's affiliates by one standard deviation reduces the number of consolidated affiliates by 20 percent...|$|E

We suggest that these two kinds <b>of</b> <b>consolidation,</b> which are ordinarily treated separately, overlap in time and jointly benefit from a period of reduced interference (during which no new memories are formed). Conditions that result in reduced interference include slow wave sleep (SWS), NMDA receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines, alcohol and acetylcholine antagonists.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{observation}} of memory recovery following post-train-ing amnestic interventions has historically caused {{controversy over the}} meaning of this finding, leading some authors to question the paradigm <b>of</b> a <b>consolidation</b> period for memories. Similarly, recent demonstrations of transient amnesia caused by interventions following memory reactiva-tion have been used to question the existence of a retrieval-driven recon-solidation process. The present work aims to approach the phenomenon of transient amnesia following disruptions <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> and reconso-lidation, discussing how memory recovery might be explained within a framework <b>of</b> <b>systems</b> <b>consolidation,</b> persistent synaptic reinforcement, and multiple memory traces. With these concepts in mind, we propose that long-term consolidation processes can underlie recovery from amne-sia, demonstrating the feasibility of such a hypothesis in a two-structure computational model of learning in which consolidation is dependent upon synaptic reentry reinforcement. On the basis of this, we suggest that prolonged consolidation can account for experimental findings of transient amnesia, in a way that explains differences between disruptions <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> and reconsolidation without the need to dwell into the discussion between storage- and retrieval-based explanations for memory impairment.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the evaluation for the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> and compression index of Kuantan soils using variable reused and recycled materials mixed with Portland cement. The {{objective of this}} thesis is to evaluate the change of compression index, void ratio, and coefficient <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> Kuantan Clayey stabilized by recycle and' reuse material mixed with Portland cement by using one-dimensional consolidation test and study the engineering properties of clay soil before and after undergoing one-dimensional consolidation test. This thesis describes the onedimensional consolidation tests done to compute the changes of compressibility and justify the suitable amount of additives used. Crushed glass, shredded carpet fibres, fly ash, and shredded high density polyethylene plastic which are classified as recyle and reused materials were added into Kuantan clay soil and then mixed with Portland cement to study and evaluate the Kuantan clay in term of compressibility. In this thesis, the values <b>of</b> coefficient <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> and compression index soils were done using a One-dimensional consolidation test. The analysis of the test was performed semiautomatically using One-dimensional consolidation program from ELE International. After analysis by the <b>system,</b> the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> and compression index of the samples obtained were employed as parameter to find the compressibility of Kuantan clay soil. From the results conducted, analysis of using fly ash blend is more conservative reading in coefficient <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> indicated better rate <b>of</b> <b>consolidation.</b> Still, soil sample added with crushed glass mixed with Portland cement performed better decrement in compression index indicated better performance in compressibility. The achieved results utilizing high density polyethylene and carpet fibres gave low performance in compressibility compared to crushed glass and fly ash. In conclusion, after comparing all the recycled and reused materials, crushed glass mixed with Portland cement is the most capable treatments to improve engineering properties of Kuantan clay.

40|$|When the Province of Canterbury was {{established}} by the Canterbury Association its founders looked at the English <b>system</b> <b>of</b> education and saw many of its problems. Education {{was seen as a}} panacea for many of the ills of the 19 th century but the system in Britain was dependent on the churches, and with the increasing population and rural-urban migration the system became overloaded. A factor which saw state involvement become essential. As the Canterbury founders wanted to avoid importing many of the British problems education was seen as a high priority. This thesis looks at how the state influenced the development <b>of</b> the education <b>system</b> in the North Canterbury Education Board region, as defined in 1900, over the period of 1850 to 1940. With the spatial distribution of elementary schools and their effects on the community being of particular interest. In Canterbury while the initial momentum originated from the aims of the founders, the rural communities took the initiative and following meetings, and some Education Board funding, they founded area schools. Attention is paid to the school as the "heart of the village" and its use for many non-educational purposes. These included utilisation as the post-office, the library, the museum and the entertainment, social and sporting centre. A special look is taken at the transport advancements which led to the loss of services in many rural areas and thus the loss of population and a decline in school rolls. This in turn led {{to the beginning of the}} school bus service in 1924 and the acceleration of the closure of many small schools as a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidations</b> took place. Many of the changes in the spatial distribution of schools in the North Canterbury region were due to the actions of the state in the passing of various regulations the first and most pivotal during the period studied, 1850 - 1940, being that of the 1877 Education Act. This was followed by many others, the most important dealing compulsory attendance, another factor influential in changing the map of schools in the region. From this study it can be seen that the school was regarded as being the most important feature of the community. Regardless of age or religious beliefs everyone was able to have an interest in it and the school acted as a unifying factor for the district...|$|R

40|$|In March 2011, the European Commission {{submitted}} {{a proposal for}} a Council Directive on an optional common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB). If this proposed CCCTB system comes into force, taxes calculated under the currently existing <b>system</b> <b>of</b> separate accounting might be replaced by a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> group <b>consolidation</b> and formulary apportionment. Then, multinational groups (MNGs) would face the decision as to whether to opt for the CCCTB system. Prior research focuses mainly on the differences in economic behaviour under both systems in general. By con-trast, we study the conditions under which one or the other tax system is preferable from the per-spective of an MNG, with a particular focus on loss-offsets. We identify four effects that determine the decision of an MNG: the tax-utilization of losses, the allocation of the tax base, the dividend and intragroup interest taxation. We find mixed results, e. g., that the CCCTB system proves ad-vantageous for increasing loss/profit streams (e. g. from start-ups or R&D projects) of the individual group entities, whereas the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> separate accounting is beneficial for decreasing profit/loss streams (e. g. caused by a decrease in return from a mature product).
