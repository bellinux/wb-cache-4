40|$|One of {{the targets}} of the {{experiment}} IVIDIL (Influence Vibrations on Diffusion in Liquids) conducted on-board ISS was to study the response of binary mixtures to vibrational forcing when the density gradient results from thermal and compositional variations.

We present the results of two experimental runs conducted on-board ISS {{in the frame of}} the experiment IVIDIL for low and strong vibrational forcing. The experimental observations revealed that a significant mean flow is set within 2 minutes after imposing vibrations and later in time it varies weakly and slowly due to the <b>Soret</b> <b>effect.</b> A mathematical model has been developed to compute the thermal and concentration fields in the experiment IVIDIL and verify the accuracy of picture processing based on the classical approach used in non-convective systems with the <b>Soret</b> <b>effect.</b> The effect of temperature and concentrations perturbations by joint action of vibrational convection and <b>Soret</b> <b>effect</b> on long time scale are carefully examined.
