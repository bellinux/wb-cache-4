500|$|The site {{returned}} to the web as punishedstormer.com on August 24, hosted by DreamHost, whose other far-right clients include National Vanguard and the Northwest Front. DreamHost stated that they were [...] "standing up for freedom and democracy"; denial-of-service attacks from Anonymous caused all of their sites to go offline. Days later, The Daily Stormer was available under an Albanian [...]al ccTLD, dailystormer.al. Within four days, it was removed by registrar Host.al for breaking their content rules. In September, The Daily Stormer was briefly registered with a [...]at address from Austria, but this was removed by registrar nic.at when local politicians complained. Later that month, it reappeared on a [...]is domain from Iceland, a country known for its freedom of speech; Anglin said that the recent collapse of the Nordic island's government meant that politicians would be distracted from affairs related to his website. Before the end of September, ISNIC pulled The Daily Stormer because Anglin refused its <b>standard</b> <b>condition</b> of disclosing his address, fearing that the information would be passed to law agencies. From September 21 to October 6, The Daily Stormer was hosted on a [...]cat domain, exclusively reserved for websites promoting Catalan language and culture. It exploited weakened filters after the Spanish government raided the offices of registrar Fundació puntCAT amidst a political crisis, and published several pieces in support of Catalan independence. It was then hosted on a Philippine [...]ph domain, [...] and [...]ai from Anguilla.|$|E
