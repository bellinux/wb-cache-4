5|$|The tucuxi (<b>Sotalia</b> fluviatilis) in the Amazon River {{is another}} species descended from oceanic dolphins; however, {{it does not}} {{perfectly}} fit the label of 'facultative' either, as it occurs only in fresh water. The tucuxi was until recently considered conspecific with the Guiana dolphin (<b>Sotalia</b> guianensis), which inhabits marine waters. It may also be true for the Irrawaddy dolphin and the finless porpoise that, although the species {{may be found in}} both freshwater and marine environments, individual animals found in rivers {{may not be able to}} survive in the ocean, and vice versa. The tucuxi is currently classified as an oceanic dolphin (Delphinidae).|$|E
50|$|The dolphin genus <b>Sotalia</b> is {{considered}} to have two member species with the classification of <b>Sotalia</b> guianensis as a distinct species from <b>Sotalia</b> fluviatilis in 2007. This {{was a result of}} recent morphometric analyses, as well as mitochondrial DNA analysis.|$|E
50|$|Although {{described}} as species {{distinct from the}} tucuxi <b>Sotalia</b> fluviatilis by Pierre-Joseph van Bénéden in 1864, the costero <b>Sotalia</b> guianensis has subsequently been synonymized with <b>Sotalia</b> fluviatilis with the two species being treated as subspecies, or marine and freshwater varieties. The first to reassert differences between these two species was a three-dimensional morphometric study of Monteiro-Filho and colleagues. Subsequently a molecular analysis by Cunha and colleagues unambiguously demonstrated that <b>Sotalia</b> guianensis was genetically differentiated from <b>Sotalia</b> fluviatilis. This finding was reiterated by Caballero and colleagues with {{a larger number of}} genes. The existence of two species has been generally accepted by the scientific community;.|$|E
50|$|Physically, {{the species}} resembles the {{bottlenose}} dolphin but differs sufficiently {{to be placed}} in a separate genus, <b>Sotalia.</b> The costero (<b>Sotalia</b> guianensis), related dolphins present in coastal and estuarine environments and formerly grouped together with the tucuxi, have recently been recognized as a distinct species.|$|E

50|$|The area is IUCN {{protected}} area category V (protected landscape/seascape).The {{purpose is to}} protect biological diversity and ensure the sustainable use of natural resources.Specific goals include protecting the feeding and reproduction area of the resident population of Tucuxi (<b>Sotalia</b> fluviatilis) freshwater dolphins, and protecting remnants of the Atlantic Rain Forest and water sources needed for survival of local fishing communities.|$|E
50|$|The Guiana dolphin (<b>Sotalia</b> guianensis) is {{frequently}} described as looking {{similar to the}} bottlenose dolphin. However, it is typically smaller, at only up to 2.1 m (6.9 ft) in length. The dolphin is coloured light to bluish grey on its back and sides. The ventral region is light grey. The dorsal fin is typically slightly hooked, with a triangular shape. The beak is well-defined and of moderate length.|$|E
50|$|Dolphins {{have evolved}} electroreception in {{structures}} {{different from those}} of fish, amphibians and monotremes. The hairless vibrissal crypts on the rostrum of the Guiana dolphin (<b>Sotalia</b> guianensis), originally associated with mammalian whiskers, are capable of electroreception as low as 4.8 μV/cm, sufficient to detect small fish. This is comparable to the sensitivity of electroreceptors in the platypus. To date (June 2013), these cells have been described from only a single dolphin specimen.|$|E

50|$|The {{forest is}} home to species endemic to the Amazon basin such as the Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis) and tucuxi (<b>Sotalia</b> fluviatilis), and to the white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus) and white-nosed saki (Chiropotes albinasus), {{primates}} whose presence in the Tapajós basin was not certain until their presence {{was reported in the}} forest. Bird species endemic to the forest include the dark-winged trumpeter (Psophia viridis), Gould's toucanet (Selenidera gouldii) and lettered aracari (Pteroglossus inscriptus).|$|E
50|$|The tucuxi (<b>Sotalia</b> fluviatilis), {{alternatively}} in Peru bufeo gris or bufeo negro, is {{a species}} of freshwater dolphin found in the rivers of the Amazon Basin. The word tucuxi {{is derived from the}} Tupi language word tuchuchi-ana, and has now been adopted as the species' common name. Despite being found in geographic locations similar to those of 'true' river dolphins such as the boto, the tucuxi is not closely related to them genetically. Instead, it is classed in the oceanic dolphin family (Delphinidae).|$|E

Its population is limited to freshwater habitats, and, unlike other manatees, it does not venture into salt water. It is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
50|$|In 2007 the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio) {{estimated}} that over 2,000 families of fisherfolk used {{the natural resources}} in the proposed reserve area for their livelihood. Aquatic farms cultivated mussels and oysters in the bay, and tourism was expanding.Endangered species such as the Guiana dolphin (<b>Sotalia</b> guianensis), La Plata dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei) and Atlantic goliath grouper (Epinephelus itajara) depended on the environmental quality of the bay.There were 6200 ha of mangroves in the area, the sole habitat of the over-exploited Uçá (Ucides cordatus) species of mangrove crab.|$|E

50|$|The Lagamar de Cananéia State Park {{is in the}} {{municipalities}} of Cananéia and Jacupiranga, São Paulo.It has an area of 40759 ha.The park is in the Vale do Ribeira region, and holds part of the Iguape-Cananéia-Paranaguá estuary lagoon complex, {{one of the largest}} breeding grounds for South Atlantic marine species.It was recognized by UNESCO as a core zone of Atlantic Forest Biosphere Reserve, and a natural World Heritage Site.Tucuxi (<b>Sotalia</b> fluviatilis) dolphins are often seen in the estuary complex.The Superagui lion tamarin (Leontopithecus caissara) was found in the south sector of the park in 1990, a critically endangered species endemic to the region.|$|E
50|$|Usually, these {{dolphins}} {{are active}} and feeding {{throughout the day}} and night. However, they are predominantly crepuscular. They consume about 5.5% of their body weight per day. They sometimes {{take advantage of the}} disturbances made by boats to catch disoriented prey. Sometimes, they associate with the distantly-related tucuxi (<b>Sotalia</b> fluviatilis), and giant otters (Pteronura brasiliensis) to hunt in a coordinated manner, by gathering and attacking fish stocks at the same time. Apparently, there is little competition for food between these species, as each prefers different prey. It has also been observed that captive dolphins share food.|$|E
50|$|Associated {{with these}} legends {{is the use}} of various fetishes, such as dried eyeballs and genitalia. These {{may or may not be}} {{accompanied}} by the intervention of a shaman. A recent study has shown, despite the claim of the seller and the belief of the buyers, none of these fetishes is derived from the boto. They are derived from <b>Sotalia</b> guianensis, are most likely harvested along the coast and the Amazon River delta, and then are traded up the Amazon River. In inland cities far from the coast, many, if not most, of the fetishes are derived from domestic animals such as sheep and pigs.|$|E

50|$|The Guanabara Bay oil spill, one {{of three}} major spills in the bay, {{occurred}} in January 2000 in Brazil when a leaking pipeline released 1,300,000 L of oil into Guanabara Bay. It leaked from the oil refinery at Duque de Caxias (REDUC) operated by Petrobras. Petrobas the company {{at the center of}} the oil spill immediately moved into gear and hired a cleanup crew to assess the damages and start the process to cleaning up the affected areas. This catastrophic accident had a damaging effect on marine life in the ocean, fishes, as well as, other existing areas surrounding the bay area. Many fishes were washing up on the shore dead or covered in oil. The fishing industry took a nose dive and the fishermen's livelihood was gravely affected. As a matter of fact, the fishing industry was brought to a halt giving rise to economic downfall. There was astronomical cost to be incurred with the clean-up process and the stakeholders were in a state of growing panic.Large areas of mangrove forests were killed and had not grown back ten years later. The tucuxi (<b>Sotalia</b> fluviatilis) dolphin species inhabit the bay but were able to avoid the primary effects of the oil spill.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The current taxonomic {{status of}} <b>Sotalia</b> species is uncertain. The genus once {{comprised}} five species, {{but in the}} twentieth century they were grouped into two (riverine <b>Sotalia</b> fluviatilis and marine <b>Sotalia</b> guianensis) that later were further lumped into a single species (S. fluviatilis), with marine and riverine ecotypes. This uncertainty hampers the assessment of potential impacts on populations and the design of effective conservation measures. We used mitochondrial DNA control region and cytochrome b sequence data to investigate the spe-cific status of S. fluviatilis ecotypes and their population structure along the Brazilian coast. Nested-clade (NCA), phylogenetic analyses and analysis of molecular variance of control region sequences showed that marine and riverine ecotypes form very divergent monophyletic groups (2. 5 % sequence divergence; 75 % of total molec-ular variance found between them), which have been evolving independently since an old allopatric fragmen-tation event. This result is also corroborated by cyto-chrome b sequence data, for which marine and riverine specimens are fixed for haplotypes that differ by 28 (out of 1, 140) nucleotides. According to various species defi-nition methods, we conclude that marine and riverine <b>Sotalia</b> are different species. Based on priority criteria, we recommend the revalidation of <b>Sotalia</b> guianensis (Van Bénéden 1864) for the marine animals, while riverine dolphins should retain the species name <b>Sotalia</b> fluviatilis (Gervais 1853), thus becoming the first exclusively riv-erine delphinid. The populations of S. guianensis show a strong subdivision (FST= 0. 628) along the Brazilian coast, with at least three evolutionarily significant units: north, northeastern and south/southeastern...|$|E
