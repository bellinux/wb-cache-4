5|$|Despite the {{discovery}} of many hundreds of Iron Age sites in Scotland there is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal {{that remains to be}} explained {{about the nature of the}} Celtic life in the early Christian era. Unfortunately radiocarbon dating for this period is problematic and chronological sequences are poorly understood. For a variety of reasons much of the archaeological work to date in Scotland has concentrated on the islands of the west and north and both excavations and analysis of societal structures on the mainland are more limited in scope.|$|E

25|$|In 1975–76, Esposito {{was traded}} {{because he did}} not want to {{relinquish}} his playing time, even with his age. He and Carol Vadnais were traded to the New York Rangers in exchange for Brad Park, Joe Zanussi and Jean Ratelle. This trade was monumental, as Esposito was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> scorer, but Ratelle was a skilled centre and Park was arguably the second best defenceman in the NHL, behind Bobby Orr.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{nobody knew}} how long Hearne could keep going. However, 1899 saw unmistakable signs of decline, for apart from {{early in the}} season on very helpful pitches, Hearne lost most of his sting. Despite a hat-trick in the first ever Test at Headingley that {{suggested}} he was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> bowler, Hearne's haul of wickets declined from 222 to 127 and his average rose by fifty percent – a great decline even when the very dry weather after the first few games is considered.|$|E
25|$|The Scandinavian {{languages}} are (as a language family) entirely unrelated to Finnish, Estonian, and Sami languages, which as Uralic {{languages are}} distantly related to Hungarian. Owing to the close proximity, there is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of borrowing from the Swedish and Norwegian languages in the Finnish and Sami languages. The {{long history of}} linguistic influence of Swedish on Finnish is also {{due to the fact}} that Finnish, the language of the majority in Finland, was treated as a minority language while Finland was part of Sweden. Finnish-speakers had to learn Swedish in order to advance to higher positions. Swedish spoken in today's Finland includes a lot of words that are borrowed from Finnish, whereas the written language remains closer to that of Sweden.|$|E

500|$|Immediately after {{crossing}} the Sweetwater at Burnt Ranch the trail crosses the continental divide at South Pass, unarguably {{the most important}} landmark on the entire trail. South Pass itself is an unimpressive open saddle between the Wind River Range {{to the north and}} the Antelope Hills to the south, but it represented a major milestone in the trip. In 1848, Congress created the Oregon Territory which included all the territory in Wyoming west of the Continental Divide. Crossing South Pass meant that the settlers had truly arrived in the Oregon Territory, though their ultimate destination was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> distance away. Nearby Pacific Springs offered the first water since the trail had left the Sweetwater River and marked the beginning of a relatively dry stretch of trail until the settlers reached the Green River more than [...] away.|$|E
500|$|An {{editor for}} Electric Playground {{gave it a}}n 8 out of 10 score, while an editor for Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it a 6.5 out of 10; an editor for the National Academy of Video Game Testers and Reviewers criticized the {{controls}} and difficulty, though commented that it was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> game for children. In his preview, IGN's Doug Perry wrote that hardcore gamers looking for an easy game would enjoy the humour and [...] "silly kiddie havoc", while fans of the series may also enjoy it. He praised the presentation, yet criticized the poor camera control and collision detection; {{in spite of the}} recommendation in the preview, he felt that the premise would appeal to fans of the cartoon, but that the game may not. An editor for IGN said that it would be likely to appeal to both young and female gamers, due to its less challenging gameplay and [...] "adorable" [...] characters. GameSpot's Joe Fielder felt that it was a quality title for children, yet criticized it for its camera.|$|E

[...] IGN's review of Jacob's Ladders 2010 Blu-ray release called it is [...] "an emotionally poignant, creepy horror masterpiece." [...] According to Slant Magazine, Jacob's Ladder is [...] "a bizarrely {{cohesive}} hybrid of war movie, character study, art film, and horror flick" [...] and [...] "the very act of watching the film is so emotionally draining that the viewer leaves the film feeling worked-in; the thought of repeat viewings is daunting yet insatiable." [...] DVD Review |publisher=Slant Magazine |date=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2013-06-28}} In 2011, John Kenneth Muir called the film's nightmarish hospital scene [...] "one of the most terrifying moments in all of 1990s horror cinema." [...] Muir further wrote: [...] "In its musings about death, about the end we all fear, Jacob's Ladder proves a deeply affecting and meaningful motion picture. After a screening, you'll immediately want to hug the people you love and then go outside and breathe the fresh air, or otherwise affirm your very existence." ...|$|E
50|$|Celiac disease (CD) and NCGS {{are closely}} linked with human {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA) class II genes, HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, located on chromosome 6p21. Nearly all CD patients are NLA-DQ2/HLA-DQ8 positive, with 95% HLA-DQ2 and the rest usually HLA-DQ8 (which is carried by 30% of Caucasians). However, the specificity of HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 for CD is low, with estimates ranging from 36% to 53%. In NCGS patients, the HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 alleles are present in only about 50%, which is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> proportion than in the general population.|$|R

Dragon #88 has her alignment as lawful neutral with lawful evil tendencies rather than simply lawful neutral, and most sources since have followed this. Dragon #350 states she is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> goddess, but she hides much of her power in a mystical well in order to disguise this fact.|$|R

500|$|Musically, Bax veered {{away from}} the {{influence}} of Wagner and Strauss, and deliberately adopted what he conceived of as a Celtic idiom. In 1908 he began a cycle of tone poems called Eire, described by his biographer Lewis Foreman {{as the beginning of}} the composer's truly mature style. The first of these pieces, Into the Twilight, was premiered by Thomas Beecham and the New Symphony Orchestra in April 1909, and the following year, at Elgar's instigation, Henry Wood commissioned the second in the cycle, In the Faëry Hills. [...] The work received mixed notices. The Manchester Guardians reviewer wrote, [...] "Mr Bax has happily suggested the appropriate atmosphere of mystery"; The Observer found the piece [...] "very undeterminate and unsatisfying, but not difficult to follow". The Times commented on the [...] "rather second-hand language" [...] at some points, derivative of Wagner and Debussy, although [...] "there is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal which is wholly individual". The Musical Times praised [...] "a mystic glamour that could not fail to be felt by the listener" [...] although the coherence of the piece [...] "was not instantly discernible". A third work in the cycle, Roscatha, was not performed in the composer's lifetime.|$|E
