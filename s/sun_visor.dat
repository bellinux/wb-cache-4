When Cotten's old-age scenes needed to be shot out of sequence due to Welles's injured ankle, Seiderman improvised with appliances made for Kane's make-up. A <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> was chosen to conceal Cotten's low hairline and the lenses he wore—hastily supplied by a Beverly Hills ophthalmologist—were uncomfortable.|$|E
500|$|Target {{data for}} the More-82 {{director}} {{was derived from the}} Zalp (NATO designation Half Bow) fire-control radar and Grot rangefinding radars mounted on turrets Nos. 2 and 3. These were backed up by a single KDP-8-10 optical director mount fitted with [...] and [...] rangefinders. Some of the BL-109A mounts were to fitted for range-finding radars, probably Shtag-B (NATO designation Egg Cup), but they were ordinarily controlled by three SPN-500 directors, one for each pair of gun mounts. [...] The SPN-500s carried a [...] rangefinder as well as Yakor (NATO designation <b>Sun</b> <b>Visor)</b> fire-control radar. Air search capability was provided by the Fut-N (NATO designation Slim Net) radar with anti-aircraft fire control provided by Fut-B (NATO designation Hawk Screech) radars.|$|E
500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Chris Dooley, was shot {{on location in}} Lucerne Valley, California. It premiered on September 3, 2010 on Disney Channel, following the premiere of [...] and a sneak peek of Fish Hooks. The video starts off with the band driving through the desert in a red convertible. Gomez removes a photograph from the <b>sun</b> <b>visor,</b> which is subsequently blown away by the wind. The chorus commences as the band disappears and Gomez {{steps out of the}} vehicle, wearing a dress and begins to sing. As the video progresses, a multitude of photographs of her relationship fall from the sky, as Gomez travels elegantly through the desert. During the bridge, it starts to rain as Gomez spots her love interest (Niko Pepaj) in the distance. The two begin to walk towards each other, and the video ends as they meet and hold hands.|$|E

2500|$|Whether as lightbars {{or single}} beacons, LED-based lights {{typically}} use a clear, colorless dome because the light color is an intrinsic {{property of the}} LEDs themselves. [...] LED-based lightbars can be made very thin, reducing wind resistance by around 8-10 percent, or made very flat and used in novel applications, for example to flip up under a <b>sun</b> <b>visor.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Starting in 1971, the AMI-built Matador was {{available}} in sedan and wagon body styles. Standard equipment included automatic transmission, power steering, power windows, air conditioning, and an AM radio. The engine was AMC's [...] V8, following its introduction in the 1970 Rebel. Among the options were an exterior mounted <b>sun</b> <b>visor,</b> vinyl roof cover, tow hitch, and mud flaps. The cars were targeted at the top market segment and advertised as [...] "the American luxury limousine made for Australians" [...] and built for Australian conditions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} was very well-appointed for this size of car, reflecting a determination {{not to let}} the car compete on price in the volume end of the small car market (already by now contested by the Citroën Ami). [...] The Panhard 24 {{was one of the first}} cars to offer optional seat belts. [...] The front seat backs were adjustable for rake and the seats were also – unusually at this time – adjustable for height. [...] The passenger's <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> included a vanity mirror with its own light and the steering wheel was adjustable. [...] The car also boasted an unusually elaborate heater.|$|E

2500|$|Further {{equipment}} upgrades {{arrived on}} 20 July 2009 when the facelifted Australian range went on sale. All variants now offered six airbags, Bluetooth, an auxiliary audio-input jack {{for the sound}} system, <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> lamps and seatback pockets. The [...] "Ateva" [...] grade received a new audio system with 4.3-inch color LCD incorporating a rear-view camera, while the [...] "Sportivo" [...] variant gained the same LCD and dual-zone climate control. Upgrades for the [...] "Grande" [...] comprised keyless entry and starting system, rear parking sensors, an electrochromatic rear-view mirror, backup camera, and an upgraded sound system. From March 2010 production, alloy wheels were made as standard fitment to the base [...] "Altise". The limited edition [...] "Touring" [...] was re-launched the following June, this time adding a reversing camera, a rear lip spoiler, and manual transmission availability over the previous release. Due to lack of demand, Australian manufacture of Camrys fitted with manual transmissions ended {{at the end of}} May 2011.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1960, a five-door {{station wagon}} was added (WP310). The P310 was {{powered by the}} 1.2L Nissan E engine. A smaller-engine version (simply called [...] "310") was powered by the 1.0L Nissan C engine. The P311 and P312 (powered by the 60hp 1.2L Nissan E-1 engine) also had smaller-engined {{versions}} ("311" [...] and [...] "312") that were powered by the 45hp 1.0L Nissan C-1 engine. The 310 and 311 were equipped with a 3-speed manual transmission (fully synchronized for the 311 and 312). The station wagon was also available for the 311 and 312. The 312 was also available in a deluxe version (DP312). A trim model called the [...] "Fancy Deluxe" [...] (model code DP312-L) was marketed for the female driver; it featured a pale yellow exterior, pale yellow/grey interior, high heel shoe holder under the dash, a vanity mirror {{on the back of}} the driver's side <b>sun</b> <b>visor,</b> a turn signal relay that played music, curtains, automatic clutch, and bigger mirrors. By February 1961, a 1.2L overhead-valve engine (codenamed E-1) became an option on a higher-trim DX model.|$|E
2500|$|The {{greatest}} novelty for 1981 was {{the introduction}} of a third trim level within the VAM's Rally line, the company's first high-end luxury sporty model called Rally SST. This version carried the same mechanicals as the Rally AMX except that it came equipped from the factory with the three-speed automatic transmission. Appearance wise, the car carried bright trim on the rocker panels, wheel lips, drip rails, B-pillar molding plus door and side glass bases. The moldings for the windshield and rear glass were also bright instead of blacked out while both bumpers were chromed. The lower portions of the sides, doors and front fenders carried wide moldings with a horizontal six-stripe pattern. The in-house five-spoke wheels held AMC's [...] "Noryl" [...] wheel cover design. Finally, chromed squared mirrors with inside controls were fitted to the doors. The Rally SST is the closest VAM counterpart to the AMC Spirits in terms of appearance and the Mexican equivalent of the US AMC Spirit Limited model. To reduce the sportiness and enforce the luxury appointments of the line, a fender-mounted electric antenna was made standard equipment so the AMX's sporty roof-mounted diagonal design would not be present. For this same reason, the rear spoiler was not available. Among its unique characteristics, the Rally SST included side armrest safety reflectors and <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> lighted vanity mirror from the factory, which were unavailable in the AMXs and GTs. The interior of the Rally SST was the same as the one of the GTs and AMXs with the only exceptions of the center console having an open compartment in place of the auxiliary gauges and the quartz electric digital clock instead of both tachometer types. Despite the luxury focus, the sporty aspects were retained {{in the form of the}} individual reclining Recaro-type bucket seats, center console with armrest and rear ashtray, floor-mounted transmission, leather-wrapped sports steering wheel and the full suspension package with rear sway bar.|$|E

5000|$|Most modern {{cars have}} two <b>sun</b> <b>visors,</b> {{one for the}} driver's side and a second for the passenger's side, with the {{rear-view}} mirror often mounted in between the two <b>sun</b> <b>visors.</b> Each visor can be lowered to help block light from the sun entering through the windshield. Some are designed {{so they can be}} released from one bracket and be turned towards the side window, covering {{a small part of the}} window at the top to block sunlight shining onto the side of the face. Some current visors can also be extended along the side window to block sunlight all of the way to the [...] "B" [...] pillar to block the light for the driver or passenger.|$|R

50|$|A {{characteristic}} {{addition to}} the 1200s in 1961 was a <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> to help reduce glare. As they became due for heavy overhauls in the late 1970s, they were withdrawn.|$|E
