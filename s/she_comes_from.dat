25|$|Wendy Rose {{was born}} Bronwen Elizabeth Edwards on May 7, 1948, in Oakland, California. Though she is of Hopi and Miwok ancestry, Rose {{was raised in}} a {{predominantly}} white community in San Francisco. Growing up in an urban environment far removed from reservation life and Native American relations gave her little to no access to her native roots as a child. A theme at the forefront of her poetry, <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> a mixed-blood family. Though her father is a full-blood Hopi, Rose was denied membership in her father’s tribe because ancestry is determined matrilineally. Her mother was partly Miwok, but refused to acknowledge her American Indian heritage (instead she acknowledged her European ancestry including English, Scottish, Irish, and German extraction).|$|E

25|$|The most noted of the palace's ghosts is the Vita frun (the White lady). A White Lady, White woman, Weiße Frau or Dame Blanche is said {{to exist}} in many European castles and {{likewise}} in Stockholm. According to legend, the White Lady is a messenger of death for someone in the Royal Family. She showed up when someone was about to die. She is supposedly tall and wears a white silk dress, only the rustle of the silk is heard as she approaches. There are several theories as to who she might be and where <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from.</b> According to one theory she is the Duchess Agnes of Merán, a German noble lady from the House of Hohenzollern {{who lived in the}} 1200s. She was married to Count Otto of Orlamünde until he died in 1293. She murdered both her children by him to be able to marry Albrect, a Count from Nurnberg also known as The Fair, but he abandoned her. She died in prison and is since then showing herself as a white lady in the Hohenzollern castles in connection to important family events.|$|E
500|$|Makinti Napanangka's year {{of birth}} is uncertain, but several sources {{indicate}} she was born around 1930, although other sources indicate {{she may have been}} born as early as 1922 or as late as 1932 [...] at a location described by some sources as Lupul rockhole but by one major reference work as Mangarri. All sources agree that <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the area of Karrkurritinytja or Lake MacDonald, which straddles the border between Western Australia and the Northern Territory, [...] south-west of Kintore, and about [...] west of Alice Springs.|$|E

When her teenage boyfriend Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) joins the glee club, New Directions, Quinn worries about his interaction with the group's star, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), and joins New Directions herself along with her fellow Cheerios Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris). Sue then enlists the three of them to help her destroy the glee club from the inside.|$|E

500|$|Izabel: Izabel is {{the ghost}} of a teenage girl from the planet Cleave who was killed by a landmine. She manifests as a reddish torso with her {{intestines}} hanging out from under the hem of her T-shirt. <b>She</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> a family of resistance fighters who built tunnels to escape people who invaded Cleave. She makes a deal with Alana to save Marko's life in exchange for being taken with them when they leave the planet, but to do so has to bond her soul to Hazel's. Although Alana is initially reluctant to allow this, she finally relents and soon comes to appreciate Izabel's presence since she can act as a [...] "babysitter" [...] at night and allow Alana and Marko to rest. She has the ability to create realistic illusions with which she can disguise her appearance, although these do not work on machines such as the Robots.|$|E
500|$|Adopted by the Heap {{family as}} a baby in place of Septimus, Jenna Heap is the {{daughter}} of an assassinated queen. She is a small girl, with deep violet eyes and fair complexion; she wears a deep red cloak and the gold circlet of the princess on her head. She is portrayed as loving and caring at heart, but sometimes very stubborn. In the first novel she has a pet rock called Petroc Trelawney (presumably named after Petroc Trelawny), which she loses when the Marram Marshes are flooded; she later acquires a pet duck called Ethel. The ambiguity of Jenna's characterization has been questioned, with one critic commenting: [...] "s the Princess or Queenling, <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> a turbulent past and is thrust into the anonymous world of ordinary society without any inkling of her royal background. The reader is therefore left guessing whether or not she has it in her to rise to the tenets of her position as ruler of the Castle." ...|$|E
500|$|Louise Nevelson {{has been}} a {{fundamental}} key in the feminist art movement. Credited with triggering the examination of femininity in art, Nevelson challenged the vision of what type of art women would be creating with her dark, monumental, masculine and totem-like artworks. Nevelson believed that art reflected the individual, not [...] "masculine-feminine labels", and chose to take on her role as an artist, not specifically a female artist. Reviews of Nevelson's works in the 1940s wrote her off as just a woman artist. A reviewer of her 1941 exhibition at Nierendorf Gallery stated: [...] "We learned the artist is a woman, in time to check our enthusiasm. Had it been otherwise, we might have hailed these sculptural expressions as by surely a great figure among moderns." [...] Another review was similar in its sexism: [...] "Nevelson is a sculptor; <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> Portland, Maine. You'll deny both these facts and you might even insist Nevelson is a man, when you see her Portraits in Paint, showing this month at the Nierendorf Gallery." ...|$|E

50|$|Little {{is known}} about the life of Theano, and the ancient sources are confused. According to one tradition, <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> Crete and was the {{daughter}} of Pythonax, but others said <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> Crotone and was the daughter of Brontinus. She was said by many to have been the wife of Pythagoras, although another tradition made her the wife of Brontinus. Iamblichus, in an attempt to resolve the confusion, refers to Deino as the wife of Brontinus.|$|R

500|$|Adeline Hulot, on {{the other}} hand, is mercy personified. Like her cousin Bette, <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> a peasant background, but has internalized the ideals of 19th-century womanhood, {{including}} devotion, grace, and deference. She reveals in the first scene that she has known for years about her husband's infidelities, but refuses to condemn him. Adeline's forgiving nature is often considered a significant character flaw. Some suggest that she is partly to blame for Hulot's wandering affection. C.A. Prendergast, for example, calls her forgiveness [...] "an inadequate and even positively disastrous response" [...] to her situation. He further suggests that Adeline, by choosing the role of quiet and dutiful wife, has excised from herself the erotic power to which the Baron is drawn. [...] "ne could {{at the very least}} offer the tentative speculation that Hulot's obsessional debauchery is in part the result of a certain poverty in Adeline, that the terrible logic of Hulot's excess is partially shaped by a crucial deficiency in his wife." [...] Others are less accusatory; Adeline's nearly infinite mercy, they say, is evidence of foolishness. Critic Herbert J. Hunt declares that she shows [...] "more imbecility than Christian patience", and David Bellos points out that, like her husband, she is driven by passion– albeit of a different kind: [...] "Adeline's desire (for good, for the family, for Hector, for God) is so radically different from the motivating desires of the other characters that she seems in their context to be without desire..." ...|$|E

Once Agnes has become a governess, she becomes more isolated by the large distance from her family and further alienation by her employers. Agnes does not resist the isolation, but instead uses the opportunity for self-study and personal development.|$|E

As a {{descendant}} of {{the owners of the}} New York Giants and Pittsburgh Steelers, Mara is a fan of both teams; she joked, [...] "If I'm mad at my mom I root for the Giants, and if I'm pissed at my dad I root for the Steelers." [...] This relationship contributed to her being cast in We Are Marshall. Mara has sung at both teams' games, and after missing the Steelers' victory at Super Bowl XL due to work, her contracts now state that she can attend if either team goes to the Super Bowl. She was in attendance for the Giants' victory in Super Bowl XLII, the Steelers' victory the next year in Super Bowl XLIII, and the Giants' victory in Super Bowl XLVI.|$|E
2500|$|Lexa is {{the first}} Grounder leader to seek peace, which Debnam-Carey {{described}} as [...] "somewhat difficult" [...] for the other Grounders to understand because of their [...] "rough and aggressive" [...] culture; she is also [...] "the first person to unite the 12 clans and to actually {{have the option of}} an alliance." [...] Throughout, she is extremely loyal, but more so to her own people; she puts them first regardless of the cost. Debnam-Carey said [...] "it's in [...] blood" [...] to put her people first because they [...] "are so close to her, that's what she's been groomed to be. <b>She</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> a really harsh culture and she has huge responsibilities." [...] Lexa is [...] "brutal and she's a pragmatist, but not out of unkindness. It's all she's ever known." [...] Debnam-Carey did not view Lexa as a teenager, and did not assign her an age, stating, [...] "It's almost like she skipped that period. She was placed in a position where suddenly she was forced {{to make a lot of}} hard choices that most people never have to make, no matter what their age is. The 100 is a world where you don't ever really get to be a kid." ...|$|E
