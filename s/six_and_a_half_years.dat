5|$|Henry {{presented}} {{himself as the}} legitimate heir to Henry I and commenced rebuilding the kingdom in his image. Although Stephen had tried to continue Henry I's method of government during his reign, the younger Henry's new government characterised those nineteen years as a chaotic and troubled period, with all these problems resulting from Stephen's usurpation of the throne. Henry was also careful to show that, unlike his mother the Empress, he would listen to the advice and counsel of others. Various measures were immediately carried out although, since Henry spent <b>six</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years</b> {{out of the first}} eight years of his reign in France, much work had to be done at a distance. The process of demolishing the unauthorised castles from the war continued. Efforts were made to restore the system of royal justice and the royal finances. Henry also invested heavily in the construction and renovation of prestigious new royal buildings.|$|E
5|$|In 1673, the Duke of York's {{conversion}} to Catholicism became public, and {{he married a}} Catholic princess, Mary of Modena, who was only <b>six</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years</b> older than Anne. Charles II had no legitimate children, and so the Duke of York was next {{in the line of}} succession, followed by his two surviving daughters from his first marriage, Mary and Anne—as long as he had no son. Over the next ten years, the new Duchess of York had ten children, but all were either stillborn or died in infancy, leaving Mary and Anne second and third in the line of succession after their father. There is every indication that, throughout Anne's early life, she and her stepmother got on well together, and the Duke of York was a conscientious and loving father.|$|E
5|$|Neville was {{appointed}} as Chief Forester under King Richard I in 1198. As the official {{in charge of}} the royal forests, he held one of the four great offices of the state: the others were the justiciar, the chancellor, and the treasurer. The forester was responsible for enforcing the forest law– the special law that applied to the royal forests– and presided over the forest justices, who held forest eyres. There was also a special forest exchequer, or forest treasury. In 1198 Neville presided over an Assize of the Forest that was described by the chronicler Roger of Howden as greatly oppressive. The revenues could be considerable; in 1198 the forest eyre brought in £1,980. Neville stated in 1208 that over the previous <b>six</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years</b> the amount raised by the various revenues of the forests had been £15,000; in 1212 it had been £4,486. Forest law was resented by the king's subjects, not just for its severity but also because of the large extent of the kingdom that it encompassed. It covered not just woodlands, {{but by the end of}} the 12th century between a quarter and a third of the whole kingdom. This extent enabled the Norman and Angevin kings to use the harsh punishments of forest law to extract large sums of money for their government.|$|E
50|$|Prior to Here Come the Double Deckers, Century Films {{produced}} a film serial for the Children's Film Foundation called The Magnificent <b>Six</b> <b>and</b> 1/2.

Many of the crew members from the <b>Six</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Half</b> series also worked on the Double Deckers, including producer Roy Simpson, director and writer Harry Booth, writer Glyn Jones, and choreographer Arnold Taraborrelli (who designed the title cards for <b>Six</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Half).</b> In addition, future Double Deckers cast members Brinsley Forde and Michael Audreson were among the stars of <b>Six</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Half,</b> <b>and</b> Melvyn Hayes appeared in <b>a</b> few episodes. <b>Six</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Half</b> also featured several gags and plotlines that would later be reused in Double Deckers.|$|R

25|$|Investigator was {{declared}} unseaworthy, so in 1803 Flinders {{was compelled to}} return to England as a passenger on , together with his charts and logbooks.

However, the governor of Mauritius kept Flinders in prison for <b>six</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years.</b> As a consequence, the first published map of the full outline of Australia was the Freycinet Map of 1811, a product of Baudin's expedition. It preceded the publication of Flinders' map of Australia, Terra Australis or Australia, by three years. Flinders also published in 1814 his account of the voyage in A Voyage to Terra Australis, which was published just before his death at the age of 40.|$|E
