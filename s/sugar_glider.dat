5|$|Numerous nectar-feeding {{insects are}} {{attracted}} to the flower spikes, which in turn attract honeyeaters, silvereyes and sunbirds, many of which consume both nectar and insects. The <b>sugar</b> <b>glider</b> (Petaurus breviceps) forages among the flower spikes and is a probable pollinator. The common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis) feeds on nectar. B.dentata has been recorded as a host plant for the mistletoe species Amyema benthamii, Decaisnina angustata and D.signata.|$|E
5|$|A 1988 {{field study}} found that most flowers of B.serrata opened at night, and {{recorded}} the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii), <b>sugar</b> <b>glider</b> (Petaurus breviceps), eastern pygmy possum (Cercartetus nanus), and bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) as nocturnal mammalian visitors and pollinators. Other mammals recorded eating the flowers include the grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus), little red flying fox (P. scapulatus) and common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis). Banksia serrata is a host plant for the larval and adult stages of the banksia jewel beetle (Cyrioides imperialis). Native bees and European honey bees visit the flowers.|$|E
5|$|Native mammals, such as {{the brown}} antechinus and <b>sugar</b> <b>glider,</b> are {{important}} pollinators of B. paludosa. Several species of honeyeaters visit the flower spikes, as do ants and the European honey bee. The response to bushfire depends on the subspecies; subspecies paludosa regenerates from underground lignotubers, while plants of subspecies astrolux are killed by fire and regenerate from large stores of seed which have been held in cones in the plant canopy. B. paludosa is sometimes seen in cultivation, with dwarf forms being registered and sold.|$|E

5|$|Flying {{squirrels}} and <b>sugar</b> <b>gliders</b> {{are much}} alike in their body plans with gliding wings stretched between their limbs, but flying squirrels are placental mammals while <b>sugar</b> <b>gliders</b> are marsupials, widely separated within the mammal lineage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sugar</b> <b>gliders</b> are {{seasonally}} adapted omnivores with a {{wide variety}} of foods in their diet, and mainly forage in the lower layers of the forest canopy. <b>Sugar</b> <b>gliders</b> may obtain up to half their daily water intake through drinking rainwater, with the remainder obtained through water held in its food. In summer they are primarily insectivorous, and in the winter when insects (and other arthropods) are scarce, they are mostly exudativorous (feeding on acacia gum, eucalyptus sap, manna, honeydew or lerp). <b>Sugar</b> <b>gliders</b> have an enlarged caecum to assist in digestion of complex carbohydrates obtained from gum and sap. To obtain sap and nectar from plants, <b>sugar</b> <b>gliders</b> will strip the bark off trees or open bore holes with their teeth to access stored liquid gum. Little time is spent foraging for insects, as it is an energetically expensive process, and <b>sugar</b> <b>gliders</b> will wait until insects fly into their habitat, or stop to feed on flowers.Gliders consume approximately 11 g of dry food matter per day. This equates to roughly 8% and 9.5% of body weight for males and females, respectively.|$|R
5|$|The flower {{spikes of}} B. paludosa {{are unable to}} self-pollinate and require pollinators to set seed. A 1988 isozyme study showed very high rates of outcrossing; pollen from one plant is well-mixed among other plants in the locale. Nonflying mammals are {{important}} pollinators in heathland habitat, with the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii) a frequent visitor to flower spikes. The <b>sugar</b> <b>glider</b> (Petaurus breviceps) is another mammal pollinator. Bird species that have been observed foraging and feeding at the flowers include the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), yellow-faced honeyeater (Lichenostomus chrysops), white-eared honeyeater (L. leucotis), crescent honeyeater (Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera), New Holland honeyeater (P.novaehollandiae), and eastern spinebill (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris). Insects recorded visiting flower spikes include the European honey bee and ants.|$|E
5|$|B.integrifolia flowers have {{an unusually}} short life span for Banksia species, {{producing}} nectar {{for only about}} four to twelve days after anthesis. Most nectar is produced during the night and early in the morning, with only small amounts produced during the day. Flowers are produced all through the year, {{but there is a}} strong peak in autumn. Little else flowers within its range at this time, so it is a seasonally important source of food for nectariferous animals. Surveys have observed a range of animals feeding on the species, including a wide range of insects; many species of bird including Phylidonyris novaehollandiae (New Holland honeyeater), Anthochaera carunculata (red wattlebird), Anthochaera chrysoptera (little wattlebird), Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris (eastern spinebill) and Trichoglossus haematodus (rainbow lorikeet); and mammals such as Petaurus norfolcensis (squirrel glider), Petaurus breviceps (<b>sugar</b> <b>glider),</b> Acrobates pygmaeus (feathertail glider) and Pteropus poliocephalus (grey-headed flying fox). In some areas such as at Bungawalbin National Park in northern New South Wales, B.integrifolia is the only source of nectar and pollen in the autumn (March–April) and late winter (July). The importance of non-flying mammals to pollination of B.integrifolia was demonstrated in 1989, with a study in Wilsons Promontory National Park showing a reduction of fruit set when measures were taken to exclude them.|$|E
5|$|Arboreal animals {{frequently}} have elongated limbs {{that help them}} cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, {{the tip of the}} tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the <b>sugar</b> <b>glider.</b> Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.|$|E
50|$|According to naturalist Ronald Campbell Gunn, no Petaurus {{species is}} {{indigenous}} to Tasmania. He concluded that <b>sugar</b> <b>gliders</b> {{had been brought}} to Launceston, Tasmania as pets from Port Phillip, Australia (now Melbourne) soon after the founding of the port in 1834. Many <b>sugar</b> <b>gliders</b> had escaped and quickly became established in the area. The species has been identified {{as a threat to the}} survival of the Swift parrot which breeds only in Tasmania. Reduction in mature forest cover has left Swift parrot nests highly vulnerable to predation by <b>sugar</b> <b>gliders,</b> and it is estimated that the parrot could be extinct by 2031.|$|R

40|$|Globally {{there are}} many threats to wild populations of animals. While {{there are many}} "traditional" {{conservation}} initiatives being implemented in Australia, species of native mammals continue to decline in number. As such, additional cost-effective means of conserving and protecting endangered species are appropriate and possibly required for maximising the likelihood of effective, long-term conservation. One strategy {{with the potential to}} assist with long-term conservation is to establish a well regulated companion animal industry for Australian fauna. This could become a financially self-sufficient endeavour, with the potential to increase public commitment to native animals and their habitats being secured into the future. However, {{little is known about the}} suitability of Australian marsupials as companion animals. This project looks at one such species, Petaurus breviceps (<b>Sugar</b> <b>Gliders),</b> to determine if they are suitable to be kept as a companion animal. A total of 216 individuals who kept 1463 <b>Sugar</b> <b>Gliders</b> between them volunteered to participate in this study. Based on a questionnaire sent to these participants, it was found that <b>Sugar</b> <b>Gliders</b> are a suitable species to be kept as a companion animal in terms of twelve criteria.
