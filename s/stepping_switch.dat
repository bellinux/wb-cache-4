25|$|The Panel switch {{was named}} for its tall panels covered with 500 rows of terminals. Each panel had an {{electric}} motor to drive usually sixty selectors by electromagnetically controlled clutches. The selector was similar in effect to a <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> though it moved continuously over the contacts. Each selector had five brushes, each of which could select from 100 terminals arranged in groups. Pulses were sent {{in the opposite direction}} than in the preexisting Strowger switches, i.e. from the selector to the register which had received the dialed digits from the caller, a signaling method that became known as revertive pulsing.|$|E
25|$|Other numeric-display {{technologies}} concurrently in use included backlit columnar transparencies ("thermometer displays"), light pipes, rear-projection and edge-lit lightguide displays (all using individual incandescent or neon {{light bulbs}} for illumination), Numitron incandescent filament readouts, Panaplex seven-segment displays, and vacuum fluorescent display tubes. Before Nixie tubes became prominent, most numeric displays were electromechanical, using stepping mechanisms to display digits either directly {{by use of}} cylinders bearing printed numerals attached to their rotors, or indirectly by wiring the outputs of stepping switches to indicator bulbs. Later, a few vintage clocks even used a form of <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> to drive Nixie tubes.|$|E
25|$|In {{electrical}} controls, a <b>stepping</b> <b>switch,</b> {{also known}} as a stepping relay, is an electromechanical device which allows an input connection to be connected to {{one of a number of}} possible output connections, under the control of a series of electrical pulses. The major use for these devices was in early automatic telephone exchanges to route telephone calls. It can step on one axis (called a uniselector), or on two axes (a Strowger switch). As the first automated telephone switch using electromagnets and hat pins, stepping switches were invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1888. Strowger filed his patent application on March 12, 1889, and it was issued on March 10, 1891.|$|E

50|$|The two {{transformers}} were - unusual at the SBB - air ventilated. The {{design was}} the same as the Be 5/7 of the BLS. The switches were fixed to the transformers. The connection to the respective voltage steps was executed with contact camshafts. The switching process was started with special sparkle extinguishing camshafts. The <b>step</b> <b>switch</b> used compressed air and had 12 steps. Since the two switches were operated alternatively, this meant that 23 steps were required which meant that the switching time was very slow. To operate the <b>step</b> <b>switches,</b> the locomotive driver had to turn a vertical crank handle once for each step. It was possible to shut off power by running down both <b>step</b> <b>switches</b> with a special handle.|$|R

2500|$|On March 10, 1891, Almon Brown Strowger, an {{undertaker}} in Kansas City, Missouri, patented the <b>stepping</b> <b>switch,</b> {{a device}} {{which led to}} the automation of telephone circuit switching. While there were many extensions and adaptations of this initial patent, the one best known consists of 10 levels or banks, each having 10 contacts arranged in a semicircle. When used with a rotary telephone dial, each pair of digits caused the shaft of the central contact [...] "hand" [...] of the <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> to first step (ratchet) up one level for each pulse in the first digit and then to swing horizontally in a contact row with one small rotation for each pulse in the next digit.|$|E
50|$|The 18-step {{flat track}} BBC <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> was {{mounted on the}} transformer. It was driven by a battery {{supplied}} direct-current motor.

It was possible to operate the <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> by hand, but only by someone actually at the switch inside the centre locomotive body.|$|E
50|$|The <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> {{transmitted}} the {{traction current}} to the motors which were connected in series circuit. The flat track <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> was mounted to the transformer. It consisted of 18 steps with voltages between 230 V and 1300 V. For both motor groups a reverse switch was mounted.|$|E

50|$|The Japanese Foreign Office used {{a locally}} {{developed}} electrical <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> based system (called Purple by the US), and also had used several similar machines for attaches in some Japanese embassies. One of the electrical <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> based systems referred to earlier as Purple {{was called the}} 'M-machine' by the US, another {{was referred to as}} 'Red'. All were broken, to one degree or another, by the Allies.|$|E
50|$|The <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> {{transmitted}} the {{traction current}} to the motors, which were connected in series circuit. The flat track <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> was {{mounted on the}} transformer and consisted of 18 steps providing voltages between 237V and 1350V. To suppress sparks during switching, spark switches were used. The switch was operated by a 36V motor powered by a battery. To operate the step switches the locomotive driver had to turn a vertical crank handle, later changed to a horizontal controller. These controllers drove two polarized relays, which switched up until the requested step was reached.|$|E

50|$|<b>Stepping</b> <b>switches</b> {{were quite}} noisy in {{operation}} (especially when self-stepping), because their mechanisms accelerated and stopped quickly to minimize operating time.

50|$|In a uniselector, the <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> steps only on one axis, {{although}} there are often several sets of contacts in parallel. In other types, such as the Strowger switch, mechanical switching occurs on two directions, across a grid of contacts. The Strowger switch was invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1888.|$|E

Although the Japanese purchased the Enigma machine they chose to base their cipher machine on a different technology. Rather than use rotors the Japanese used a <b>stepping</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E
50|$|A basic <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> is an {{electrically}} operated rotary switch {{with a single}} (typically input) terminal, and multiple (typically output) terminals. Like other typical rotary switches, the single terminal connects {{to one of the}} multiple terminals by rotating a contact arm, sometimes called a wiper, to the desired position. Moving from one position to the next is called stepping, hence the name of the mechanism. Using traditional terminology, this is a single-pole, multi-position switch.|$|E
50|$|Two {{diamond-shaped}} pantographs - controllable with a valve in each cab - {{lead the}} current from the catenary {{to the two}} electrical cutting knives {{on the roof of}} the locomotive body. These cutting knives could be controlled manually from the engine room. From these cutting knives, the current was transferred to the oil-cooled transformer over a lightning protection inductor and the oil-propelled main switch. The transformer was located in the center of the locomotive body. On the high voltage side, the transformer was switchable for either 15,000 V or 7500 V. This arrangement was necessary since the SBB decided to supply the Gotthard railway line at start only with 7500 V because the main operation was still steam. The SBB was considering that the carbon black on the insulators of the catenary could lead to shortcuts when very high voltage was used. The low-voltage side of the transformer was bifid and equipped with 11 taps. The two camshaft switches were mounted in longitudinal direction on both sides of the transformer. It was possible - as at the Be 3/5 12201 - to select 23 steps. For handling the <b>step</b> <b>switches,</b> the locomotive driver had to turn a vertical crank handle once for each step. It was possible to shut off power by running down both <b>step</b> <b>switches</b> with a special handle. If one <b>step</b> <b>switch</b> failed it could be separated. With the remaining one it was possible to continue the trip with the 12 steps of the other one. The four pneumatic controlled reverse switches were placed on the motors. They were connected in parallel.|$|R

5000|$|Most <b>stepping</b> <b>switches</b> {{rotate the}} wipers {{in only one}} direction, but some are bidirectional; the latter have a second magnet to rotate the wipers the other way. A third variety [...] "winds" [...] a spring as the wiper steps progressively, and a ratchet holds the wipers from {{returning}} to home position. When the circuit is no longer needed, another electromagnet releases the holding pawl; the spring then returns the wipers to their home position.|$|R
