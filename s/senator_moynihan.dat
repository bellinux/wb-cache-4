Of late we find ourselves relying on archives of the former Soviet Union in Moscow to resolve questions of what was going on in Washington at mid-century. ... the Venona intercepts contained overwhelming proof of the activities of Soviet spy networks in America, complete with names, dates, places, and deeds."One of the considerations in releasing Venona translations was the privacy interests of the individuals mentioned, referenced, or identified in the translations. Some names were not released because to do so would constitute an invasion of privacy.However, in at least one case, independent researchers identified one of the subjects whose name had been obscured by the NSA.|$|E
50|$|The race {{began in}} November 1998 when four-term {{incumbent}} New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement. Both the Democratic Party and Republican Party sought high-profile candidates {{to compete for}} the open seat. By early 1999 Clinton and Mayor of New York City Rudolph Giuliani were the likely respective nominees. John F. Kennedy Jr., son of former President John F. Kennedy was also seen as a potential candidate to succeed <b>Senator</b> <b>Moynihan,</b> prior to his death in 1999. Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, purchased a house in Chappaqua, New York, in September 1999; she thereby became eligible for the election, although she faced characterizations of carpetbagging since she had never resided in the state before. The lead in statewide polls swung from Clinton to Giuliani and back to Clinton as the campaigns featured both successful strategies and mistakes as well as dealing with current events. In late April and May 2000, Giuliani's medical, romantic, marital, and political lives all collided in a tumultuous four-week period, culminating in his withdrawing from the race on May 19.|$|E

40|$|The {{enactment}} of the Family Support Act was {{the outcome of a}} six-year legislative and administrative review of, and debate about, welfare policy and programs.

This article examines the evolution of the Family Support Act within the United States Congress, spotlighting two important time periods leading up to its enactment: 1981 to 1985 and 1986 to 1988. Original documentsfroin the files of the late <b>Senator</b> <b>Moynihan,</b> legislative sponsor of the Family Support Act, as well as a comprehensive investigation of Congressional records of hearings and debates, media editorials and commentaries, and extensive Congressional interviews form the basis for this analysis which vividly illustrates the politics of welfare policy-making in the United States.
