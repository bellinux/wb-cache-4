50|$|Oxfords {{were derived}} from the Oxonian, a half-boot with side slits that gained {{popularity}} at Oxford University in 1800. Unlike early shoes, Oxfords were cut smaller than the foot. The <b>side</b> <b>slit</b> evolved into a side lace that eventually moved to the instep, as students rebelled against knee-high and ankle-high boots. The toe cap can either be lined with two narrow rows of stitching, perforated holes along the end cap stitching (quarter-brogue), perforated holes along the end cap stitching and on the toe cap (semi-brogue), or a semi-brogue with the classical wingtip design (full-brogue).|$|E
