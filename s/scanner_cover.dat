40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{geometric}} characteristics of synthetic macrofibers {{are important because}} they affect the behavior of fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC). Because {{there is a lack}} of specific, relevant publications in Brazil, the European standard EN 14889 - 2 : 2006 was adopted as a reference to perform the characterization. Thus, an experimental plan was developed to assess the adequacy of testing procedures for the qualification of synthetic macrofibers for use in FRC. Two types of macrofibers were evaluated. The length measurement was performed using two methods: the caliper method, which is a manual measurement, and the digital image analysis method using the ImageJ software for image processing. These aforementioned methods were used to determine the diameter together with the density method, which is an indirect method that uses the developed length obtained by one of the previous methods. The statistical analyses revealed that the length results are similar regardless of the method used. However, the macrofibers must be pre-stretched to maximize the accuracy of caliper measurements. The caliper method for diameter determination has the disadvantage of underestimating the macrofiber cross-section because of the pressure applied by the load claws. In contrast, the digital image analysis method obtains the projected diameter in a single plane, which overestimate the diameter because the macrofibers are oriented with the pressure of the <b>scanner</b> <b>cover.</b> Thus, these techniques may result in false projections of the diameters that will depend on the level of torsion in the macrofibers. It was concluded that both the caliper method using previously stretched macrofibers and the digital imaging method can be used to measure length. The density method presented the best results for the diameter determination because these results were not affected by the method chosen to determine the length...|$|E

40|$|Goals: This paper {{presents}} the performance review {{based on a}} dual-ring Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner {{being a part of}} Bruker Albira: a multi-modal small-animal imaging platform. Each ring of Albira PET contains eight detectors arranged as octagon, and each detector is built using a single continuous lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate crystal and multi-anode photo multiplier tube. In two-ring configuration, the <b>scanner</b> <b>covers</b> 94. 4 mm in axial- and 80 ´ 80 mm in trans-axial direction, which is sufficient to acquire images of small animals (e. g. mice) without the need of moving the animal bed during the scan. Methods: All measurements and majority of data processing were performed according to the NEMA NU 4 - 2008 standard with one exception. Due to the scanner geometry, the spatial resolution test was reconstructed using iterative algorithm instead of the analytical one. The main performance characteristics were compared with those of the other PET sub-systems of tri-modal smallanimal scanners. Results: The measured spatial resolution at the centre of the axial field of view in radial, tangential and axial directions was 1. 72, 1. 70 and 2. 45 mm, respectively.

40|$|Point clouds can be {{obtained}} by airborne or terrestrial Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scanning or directly from street-view panoramic imagery. Point clouds obtained from airborne <b>scanners</b> <b>cover</b> most roof information but lack facade information. Similar but orthogonal to airborne scanning, street-view point clouds cover well of the facade information but lack roof points. Therefore, it is necessary to combine those point clouds in order to construct a complete building model. For this combination, simplification is needed in which edge preservation, outlier removal, noise smoothing and uniform density have to be considered as these properties are desired in many post-processing applications. In this thesis, an algorithm pipeline is proposed that is able to take in an outlier-ridden, noisy and non-uniform roof and facade point clouds and generate an outlier-removed, edge-aware and uniform point cloud. The algorithm pipeline can be divided into two independent phases: outlier removal and simplification. The outlier removal algorithm can remove singly scattered and small cluster of outliers, whereas the simplification algorithm pipeline is able to generate a noise-reduced, uniform and edge-aware point cloud. The pipeline is validated to be able to achieve the objectives. Proof of efficiency in running-time is given, {{so that it can be}} used for processing large-size real-scene point clouds.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new algorithm {{that is capable of}} combining a sequence of peripheral angiographic images into a long-leg display automatically. In peripheral angiography, the field-of-view of the <b>scanner</b> cannot <b>cover</b> the entire peripheral region in one image. Instead, the peripheral region is divided into subregions and scanner steps to each of the location and acquires images. The adjacent stepping images overlap partially with each other during the image acquisition. Therefore, the problem for reconstructing a long-leg image display is transformed into finding the best image-matching in each adjacent image pair. The new algorithm solves this matching problem by maximizing the "overlapping ratio " for global matching in each designate image pair. The "overlapping ratio " is defined as the degree of feature agreement, in the overlapping area calculated from anatomical information of bone and vessels, between two adjacent image pairs. The experimental results indicate that the new approach is robust and generates accurate and reliable image matching. In addition, each leg is fine-tuned to determine the individual matching parameters to compensate the possible leg motion. Based on the matching parameters, we generate long-leg image display in both reduced and full resolutions so that cross reference of region-of-interest can be done interactively. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUnderground {{quarries}} {{are typically}} difficult environments for 3 D mapping. They are dark, wet, dusty, have limited lines {{of sight and}} are full of hidden corners behind pillars. These properties call for a dense succession of active measurement (using some kind of light) stations with hardened materials. Once mapped, the next obvious question creeps up, how does this cavity relate to the above-ground world? The Zebedee range of handheld mobile laser scanner was designed to address just these questions by CSIRO. We have tested a Zebedee- 1 (Zeb- 1) and a Zebedee-Revo (Zeb-Revo) in an abandoned underground quarry. The initial purpose of the work {{was to assess the}} equipment in mapping a sector of a quarry and its above-ground surroundings. In a second phase, we examined how the full 3 D dataset was to be processed to retrieve pertinent metrics for geotechnical purposes. The investigated site is located in the abandoned limestone quarry at Saint-Maximin (Oise, Northern France), where INERIS, {{within the framework of the}} R&D part of the " Plan National Cavités ", french program dedicated to cavity risk assessment, managed by the French Ministry in charge of Environment, created an underground experiment and demonstration unit. This laboratory site is dedicated to investigate underground cavity risks and operated in collaboration with Saint-Maximin town council, owners, and the " Maison de la Pierre ", manager of the site. The Zebedee range of handheld mobile laser scanners exists as Zeb- 1 and the recent Zeb-Revo. Both are time-of-flight line scanning lidar bundled with an inertial mapping unit so as to locate the moving lidar head in space and time. The scanning plane freely oscillates on a spring (Zeb- 1) or rotates around a horizontal axis in order to scan a sphere portion surrounding the holder. A 90 ° blind zone enables the holder to hide behind the scanning head and avoid being scanned inside the scene. The lidar distance meter has a nominal range of precision of 5 mm + 1 mm/m with a maximum range of 30 m. Scanning density is 40 lines per second for Zeb- 1 and 100 lines per second for Zeb-Revo. Both line <b>scanners</b> <b>cover</b> three quarters of a circle line made of 42, 000 shots. A 3 -axes accelerometer measures the attitude of the scanning head. Black-box simultaneous location and mapping algorithm (SLAM) build 3 D cloud from these measurements assuming that the surfaces where points rebound off are rigid and non-deformable. Near-neighbor point redundancy is used to make points converge towards a unique surface. Processed outputs include 3 D points in LAZ format, various decimated cloud versions and 3 D Zeb head trajectory...|$|R
30|$|Over 80 % of all cancers {{attribute}} to epithelial tissue {{and the early}} stage detection of cancer based on resection tissue or extracted body fluid for histological or cytological examination substantially reduces the death rate [1]. However, conventional biopsy with surgical excision still has some disadvantages such as random sample resection, time-consuming sample preparation, or physical invasiveness. Recently, diverse endomicroscopes combining advanced optical microscopic techniques with clinical endoscopes open up optical biopsy that can deliver many advantages of on-demand detection, precise sampling, and noninvasiveness. Laser scanning fluorescence microscopy such as confocal or multiphoton microscopy has been actively applied for optical biopsy in monitoring cellular metabolism inside highly scattering tissues such as in vivo human skin and more recently optical coherence tomography has also been developed for ophthalmological applications since the early 1990 s [2 – 4].These microscopic techniques are rapidly translated into clinical endoscopic applications. As a result, the compactness of laser scanners remains prerequisite for miniaturizing laser-scanning endomicroscopes. For the last decade, Microscanners using micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology have been exclusively utilized for endomicroscopic applications. The device compactness allows both an endomicroscopic package smaller than 3  mm in outer diameter and an operational voltage lower than 40 VDC. i.e. the maximum voltage limit for human body based on IEC 60601 - 01. This article provides a mini-review for endomicroscopic MEMS <b>scanners,</b> which <b>covers</b> the scanning arrangements, the scanning trajectories, the actuation mechanisms, and the packaging configuration with their endomicroscopic applications.|$|R
40|$|Terrestrial Laser Scanners (TLS) are {{utilized}} {{through different}} data acquisition {{techniques such as}} Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) and the output {{can be used in}} different applications such as 3 D city modelling, cultural heritage documentations, oil and Gas as built, etc [...] . In this research paper, we will investigate one of the modes of TLS on mobile mapping platform. Namely the Stop-and-Go (SAG) mode. Unlike the continuous mode, the Stop-and-Go mode does not require the use of IMU to estimate the TLS attitude and thus inturn it has an overall reduction in the system cost. Moreover, it decreases the time required for data processing in comparison with the continuous mode. For successful use of SAG mobile mapping in urban areas, it is preferred to use a long range time of flight laser <b>scanner</b> to <b>cover</b> long distances in each scan and minimize the registration error. The problem arise with Long range laser scanners is their low point cloud density. The low point cloud density affects the registration accuracy specially in monitoring applications. The point spacing between points is one of the issues facing the registration especially when the matching points are chosen manually. Since most of TLS nowadays are equipped with camera on-board we can utilize the camera to get an initial estimate of the registration parameters based on image matching. After having an initial approximation of the registration parameters we feed those parameters to the Iterative Closest Point algorithm to obtain more accurate registration result...|$|R
40|$|We have assayed {{a series}} of linker <b>scanner</b> mutants which <b>cover</b> the Xenopus laevis ribosomal gene {{promoter}} at approximately ten base pair intervals. All of these mutations adversely affect promoter activity {{with the exception of}} one mutation which stimulates activity. Thus, none are neutral. We show that most of the mutations can be partially rescued by ligating a block of enhancer elements upstream of the promoter. In addition, we have made extracts from liver nuclei which produce DNaseI protection footprints over the promoter. Analysis of both strands reveals a prominent footprinting domain from about - 5 to - 30. However, lesser changes in the digestion pattern are detected over most of the promoter. Previously published analyses have suggested that this promoter might be composed of three functional domains. The experiments presented here suggest that either 1) the three putative domains are so closely arranged that the boundaries are difficult to discern, or 2) the situation is more complex...|$|R

40|$|Background: Serious hazards {{for human}} health and life and devices in close {{proximity}} to the magnetic resonance scanners (MRI scanners) include the effects of being hit by ferromagnetic objects attracted by static magnetic field (SMF) produced by scanner magnet - the so-called ballistic hazards classified among indirect electromagnetic hazards. International safety guidelines and technical literature specify different SMF threshold values regarding ballistic hazards - e. g. 3 mT (directive 2004 / 40 /EC, EN 60601 - 2 - 33), and 30 mT (BMAS 2009, directive proposal 2011). Investigations presented in this article were performed in order to experimentally verify SMF threshold for ballistic hazards near MRI scanners used in Poland. Material/Methods: Investigations were performed {{with the use of a}} laboratory source of SMF (0 - 30 mT) and MRI scanners of various types. The levels of SMF in which metal objects of various shapes and 0. 4 - 500 g mass are moved by the field influence were investigated. The distance from the MRI scanners (0. 2 - 3 T) where hazards may occur were also investigated. Results: Objects investigated under laboratory conditions were moved by SMF of 2. 2 - 15 mT magnetic flux density when they were freely suspended, but were moved by the SMF of 5. 6 - 22 mT when they were placed on a smooth surface. Investigated objects were moved in fields of 3. 5 - 40 mT by MRI scanners. Distances from <b>scanner</b> magnet <b>cover,</b> where ballistic hazards might occur are: up to 0. 5 m for 0. 2 - 0. 3 T scanners; up to 1. 3 m for 0. 5 T scanners; up to 2. 0 m for 1. 5 T scanners and up to 2. 5 m for 3 T scanners (at the front and back of the magnet). Conclusions: It was shown that SMF of 3 mT magnetic flux density should be taken as the threshold for ballistic hazards. Such level is compatible with SMF limit value regarding occupational safety and health-protected areas/zones, where according to the Polish labor law the procedures of work environment inspection and prevention measures regarding indirect electromagnetic hazards should be applied. Presented results do not support the increase up to 30 mT of the SMF limit for protected area...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{implications}} of rational inattention for individual price dynamics. Analyzing <b>scanner</b> data that <b>cover</b> 29 product categories over a eight-year period from a large Midwestern supermarket chain, we uncover a surprising regularity in the data - small price increases occur more frequently than small price decreases. We find that this asymmetry holds for price changes of up to about 15 - 30 cents (in absolute terms) and 3 - 10 percent (in relative terms). The asymmetry disappears for larger price changes. We document this finding for the entire data set, {{as well as for}} individual product categories considered. Moreover, we find that the asymmetry holds even when we exclude from the data the observations pertaining to inflationary periods. Given the inability of the existing theories to explain the particular form of asymmetry we document, we offer a new theory of asymmetric price adjustment, which can explain our findings. The theory, which is an extension of the literature on "rational inattention," argues that observing, processing, and reacting to price change information is not a costless activity. An important implication of rational inattention is that consumers may rationally choose to ignore - and thus not to respond to - small price changes, creating a "range of inattention" along the demand curve. This range of consumer inattention, we argue, gives the retailers incentive for asymmetric price adjustment "in the small. " These incentives, however, disappear for large price changes, because large price changes are noticed by consumers and therefore trigger their response. Thus, no asymmetry is observed "in the large. "...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Microarray normalizations {{typically}} apply {{methods that}} assume absence of global transcript shifts, {{or absence of}} changes in internal control features such as housekeeping genes. These normalization approaches are not appropriate for focused arrays with small sets of genes where a large portion {{may be expected to}} change. Furthermore, many microarrays lack control features {{that can be used for}} quality assurance (QA). Here, we describe a novel external control series integrated with a design feature that addresses the above issues. Results An EC dilution series that involves spike-in of a single concentration of the A. thaliana chlorophyll synthase gene to hybridize against spotted dilutions (0. 000015 to 100 μM) of a single complimentary oligonucleotide representing the gene was developed. The EC series is printed in duplicate within each subgrid of the microarray and covers the full range of signal intensities from background to saturation. The design and placement of the series allows for QA examination of frequently encountered problems in hybridization (e. g., uneven hybridizations) and printing (e. g., cross-spot contamination). Additionally, we demonstrate that the series can be integrated with a LOWESS normalization to improve the detection of differential gene expression (improved sensitivity and predictivity) over LOWESS normalization on its own. Conclusion The quality of microarray experiments and the normalization methods used affect the ability to measure accurate changes in gene expression. Novel methods are required for normalization of small focused microarrays, and for incorporating measures of performance and quality. We demonstrate that dilution of oligonucleotides on the microarray itself provides an innovative approach allowing the full dynamic range of the <b>scanner</b> to be <b>covered</b> with a single gene spike-in. The dilution series can be used in a composite normalization to improve detection of differential gene expression and to provide quality control measures. </p...|$|R
