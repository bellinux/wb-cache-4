We postulated that a combination of DECS analysis and next-generation sequencing (NGS) would improve detection efficiency and usability of the technique. Here, we describe a model case in which we efficiently detected the presumed genome sequence of Blueberry shoestring virus (BSSV), a member of the genus Sobemovirus, which has not so far been reported. dsRNAs were isolated from BSSV-infected blueberry plants using the dsRNA-binding protein, reverse-transcribed, amplified, and sequenced using NGS.

40|$|The {{degradation}} of synthetic compounds requires bacteria {{to recruit and}} adapt enzymes from pathways for naturally occurring compounds. Previous work defined the steps in 2, 4 -dinitrotoluene (2, 4 -DNT) metabolism through the ring fission reaction. The results presented here characterize subsequent steps in the pathway that yield the central metabolic intermediates pyruvate and propionyl coenzyme A (CoA). The genes encoding the degradative pathway were identified within a 27 -kb region of DNA cloned from Burkholderia cepacia R 34, a strain that grows using 2, 4 -DNT as a sole carbon, energy, and nitrogen source. Genes for the lower pathway in 2, 4 -DNT degradation were found downstream from dntD, the gene encoding the extradiol ring fission enzyme of the pathway. The region includes genes encoding a CoA-dependent methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (dntE), a putative NADH-dependent dehydrogenase (ORF 13), and a bifunctional isomerase/hydrolase (dntG). Results from analysis of the gene <b>sequence,</b> <b>reverse</b> transcriptase PCR, and enzyme assays indicated that dntD dntE ORF 13 dntG composes an operon that encodes the lower pathway. Additional genes that were uncovered encode the 2, 4 -DNT dioxygenase (dntAaAbAcAd), methylnitrocatechol monooxygenase (dntB), a putative LysR-type transcriptional (ORF 12) regulator, an intradiol ring cleavage enzyme (ORF 3), a maleylacetate reductase (ORF 10), a complete ABC transport complex (ORF 5 to ORF 8), a putative methyl-accepting chemoreceptor protein (ORF 11), and remnants from two transposable elements. Some of the additional gene products might play as-yet-undefined roles in 2, 4 -DNT degradation; others appear to remain from recruitment of the neighboring genes. The presence of the transposon remnants and vestigial genes suggests that the pathway for 2, 4 -DNT degradation evolved relatively recently because the extraneous elements have not been eliminated from the region...|$|E
40|$|Spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubuli of the testis occurs under a high {{proliferation}} rate, suggesting considerable oxygen consumption. Because of {{the lack}} of blood vessels, the oxygen partial pressure in the lumen of these tubuli is very low. We previously identified a testis isoform of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) - 1 alpha in the mouse, termed mHIF- 1 alphaI. 1. Here, we demonstrate that expression of mHIF- 1 alphaI. 1 increases during puberty, further demonstrating its gene induction in postmeiotic germ cells. Using 5 '-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, we identified a novel HIF- 1 alpha isoform in the human testis, called hHIF- 1 alphaTe. Like mHIF- 1 alphaI. 1, hHIF- 1 alphaTe mRNA is derived from an alternative promoter-first exon combination, but with a different genomic organization and a different nucleotide <b>sequence.</b> <b>Reverse</b> transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed that hHIF- 1 alphaTe is exclusively expressed in the testis. As determined by immunofluorescence of ejaculated sperm cells, HIF- 1 alpha protein is mainly localized in the postacrosomal head and in the midpiece of spermatozoa. Though overlapping with mitochondrial localization in human and mouse spermatozoa, neither hHIF- 1 alphaTe nor hHIF- 1 alpha associated with mitochondria. In contrast with the ubiquitously expressed HIF- 1 alpha protein and the mouse testis-specific mHIF- 1 alphaI. 1 isoform, the hHIF- 1 alphaTe mRNA sequence predicts a protein with an N-terminal truncation of the DNA-binding domain. As shown by yeast two-hybrid assays, hHIF- 1 alphaTe still formed heterodimeric complexes with HIF- 1 beta. However, hHIF- 1 alphaTe was incapable of forming a DNA-binding HIF- 1 complex. Overexpression of exogenous hHIF- 1 alphaTe resulted in the inhibition of the endogenous HIF- 1 transcriptional activity, demonstrating that the testis-specific hHIF- 1 alphaTe isoform is a dominant-negative regulator of normal HIF- 1 activity...|$|E

40|$|Elucidating the {{relevant}} genomic changes mediating development {{and evolution of}} prostate cancer is paramount for effective diagnosis and therapy. A putative dominant-acting nude mouse prostatic carcinoma tumor-inducing gene, PTI- 1, has been cloned that is expressed in patient-derived human prostatic carcinomas but not in benign prostatic hypertrophy or normal prostate tissue. PTI- 1 was detected by cotransfecting human prostate carcinoma DNA into CREF-Trans 6 cells, inducing tumors in nude mice, and isolating genes displaying increased expression in tumor-derived cells by using differential RNA display (DD). Screening a human prostatic carcinoma (LNCaP) cDNA library with a 214 -bp DNA fragment found by DD permitted the cloning of a full-length 2. 0 -kb PTI- 1 cDNA. Sequence analysis indicates that PTI- 1 is a gene containing a 630 -bp 5 ' sequence and a 3 ' sequence homologous to a truncated and mutated form of human elongation factor 1 alpha. In vitro translation demonstrates that the PTI- 1 cDNA encodes a predominant approximately 46 -kDa protein. Probing Northern blots with a DNA fragment corresponding to the 5 ' region of PTI- 1 identifies multiple PTI- 1 transcripts in RNAs from human carcinoma cell lines derived from the prostate, lung, breast, and colon. In contrast, PTI- 1 RNA is not detected in human melanoma, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, normal cerebellum, or glioblastoma multiforme cell lines. By using a pair of primers recognizing a 280 -bp region within the 630 -bp 5 ' PTI- 1 <b>sequence,</b> <b>reverse</b> transcription-PCR detects PTI- 1 expression in patient-derived prostate carcinomas but not in normal prostate or benign hypertrophic prostate tissue. In contrast, reverse transcription-PCR detects prostate-specific antigen expression {{in all of the}} prostate tissues.

The approaches used, rapid expression cloning with the CREF-Trans 6 system and the DD strategy, should prove widely applicable for identifying and cloning additional human oncogenes...|$|E
40|$|A 5 -kbp region {{upstream}} of the are-ben-cat genes was cloned from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP 1, {{extending the}} supraoperonic cluster of catabolic genes to 30 kbp. Four open reading frames, salA, salR, salE, and salD, were identified from the nucleotide <b>sequence.</b> <b>Reverse</b> transcription-PCR studies suggested that these open reading frames are organized into two convergent transcription units, salAR and salDE. The salE gene, encoding a protein of 239 residues, was ligated into expression vector pET 5 a. Its product, SalE, {{was shown to}} have esterase activity against short-chain alkyl esters of 4 -nitrophenol but was also able to hydrolyze ethyl salicylate to ethanol and salicylic acid. A mutant of ADP 1 with a Kmr cassette introduced into salE had {{lost the ability to}} utilize only ethyl and methyl salicylates of the esters tested as sole carbon sources, and no esterase activity against ethyl salicylate could be detected in cell extracts. SalE was induced during growth on ethyl salicylate but not during growth on salicylate itself. salD encoded a protein of undetermined function with homologies to the Escherichia coli FadL membrane protein, which is involved in facilitating fatty acid transport, {{and a number of other}} proteins detected during aromatic catabolism, which may also function in hydrocarbon transport or uptake processes. A Kmr cassette insertion in salD deleteriously affected cell growth and viability. The salA and salR gene products closely resemble two Pseudomonas proteins, NahG and NahR, respectively encoding salicylate hydroxylase and the LysR family regulator of both salicylate and naphthalene catabolism. salA was cloned into pUC 18 together with salR and salE, and its gene product showed salicylate-inducible hydroxylase activity against a range of substituted salicylates, with the same relative specific activities as found in wild-type ADP 1 grown on salicylate. Mutations involving insertion of Kmr cassettes into salA and salR eliminated expression of salicylate hydroxylase activity and the ability to grow on either salicylate or ethyl salicylate. Studies of mutants with disruptions of genes of the β-ketoadipate pathway with or without an additional salE mutation confirmed that ethyl salicylate and salicylate were channeled into the β-ketoadipate pathway at the level of catechol and thence dissimilated by the cat gene products. SalR appeared to regulate expression of salA but not salE...|$|E
