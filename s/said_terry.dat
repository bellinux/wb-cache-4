500|$|The {{performers}} {{category is}} meant for recording artists and bands that have [...] "influence and {{significance to the}} development and perpetuation of rock and roll." [...] Artists become eligible for induction in that category 25 years {{after the release of}} their first record. In order to be inducted, an artist must be nominated by a committee that selects anywhere from nine to a dozen candidates. Ballots are sent to 600 [...] "rock experts" [...] who then evaluate the candidates and vote on who should be inducted. The performers who receive the highest number of votes and more than 50 percent of the vote are inducted. In 2011, the number inducted was five. The rest of the categories are voted on by special committees. In 2012, six additional bands and groups were inducted as performers by a special committee, due to the controversial nature of their band being excluded when their lead singer was inducted. [...] "There was a lot of discussion about this," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Terry</b> Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. [...] "There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question – it was so long ago... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result." ...|$|E

5000|$|... “It's {{important}} {{to separate the}} sexual identity and the behavior,” <b>said</b> Karen <b>Terry,</b> a second researcher. “Someone can commit sexual acts that might be of a homosexual nature but not have a homosexual identity.” <b>Terry</b> <b>said</b> factors such as greater access to boys is {{one reason for the}} skewed ratio. Smith also raised the analogy of prison populations where homosexual behavior is common even though the prisoners are not necessarily homosexuals, or cultures where men are rigidly segregated from women until adulthood, and homosexual activity is accepted and then ceases after marriage.|$|R

6000|$|... "It's {{rather a}} shame that Jimmy and his father should have a place of this kind in their hands at all," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Terry.</b> [...] "Still, for the credit of the country, I should like to explain {{that there are not}} very many English {{properties}} run on the same lines. In fact, the Denhams are an exception to everything, but I really think Jimmy might have got up in time for once in a way." ...|$|E
