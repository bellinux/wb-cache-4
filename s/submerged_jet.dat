Three different kinds of jets, developing downstream of the drop, were observed: a <b>submerged</b> <b>jet,</b> a surface wave jet, and an oscillating jet. The oscillating jet {{is defined as a}} jet which changes intermittently between a surface wave jet and a <b>submerged</b> <b>jet.</b> A different development of the scouring process due to the different kinds of jet was observed: a <b>submerged</b> <b>jet</b> produced a local scouring with a downstream dune, while a surface wave jet produced a local scouring with both an upstream and a downstream dune; the scouring process due to the oscillating jet {{was the result of the}} interaction of the scouring processes due to a <b>submerged</b> <b>jet</b> and a surface wave jet. A stability analysis of the surface wave jet was performed, with both a flat and a scoured bed, by means of the modified De Saint - Venant equations, that is, with correction terms accounting for the curvature of the streamlines. The stability of the surface wave jet is affected by the presence of the scoured bed, which weakens its stability properties...|$|E

Highly resolved temporal and spatial heat transfer measurements were obtained by measuring temperature distributions on the surfaces of an IR transparent test heater with a mid-range IR camera.

To study the generation mechanisms and key influencing factors of LFN induced by flood discharge and energy dissipation from a high dam with a ski-jump type spillway, detailed prototype observations and analyses of LFN are carried out. The discharge flow field is simulated and analyzed using a gas-liquid turbulent flow model. The acoustic response characteristics of the air cavity, which is formed between the discharge nappe and dam body, are analyzed using an acoustic numerical model. The multi-sources generation mechanisms are first proposed basing on the prototype observation results, vortex sound model, turbulent flow model and acoustic numerical model. Two kinds of sources of LFN are studied. One comes from the energy dissipation of <b>submerged</b> <b>jets</b> in the plunge pool, the other comes from nappe-cavity coupled vibration. The results of the analyses reveal that the <b>submerged</b> <b>jets</b> in the plunge pool only contribute to an on-site LFN energy of 0 – 1. 0 Hz, and the strong shear layers around the high-velocity <b>submerged</b> <b>jets</b> and wall jet development areas are the main acoustic source regions of LFN in the plunge pool. In addition, the nappe-cavity coupled vibration, which is induced when the discharge nappe vibrates with close frequency to the model frequency of the cavity, can induce on-site LFN energy with wider frequency spectrum energy within 0 – 4. 0 Hz. By contrast, the contribution degrees to LFN energy from two acoustic sources are almost same, while the contribution degree from nappe-cavity coupled vibration is slightly higher...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Technologies such as {{avionics}} {{and power}} electronics are driving {{the demand for}} thermal management schemes towards high heat fluxes and low surface temperatures. Typically, these applications require the dissipation of heat fluxes in the rage of 100 - 1000 W/cm² while maintaining surface temperatures lower than about 85 °C. Phase-change heat transfer schemes such as pool boiling, flow boiling in mini/micro-channel heat sinks, and sprays and jet impingement boiling are frequently used to meet this demand. This dissertation documents global heat transfer characteristics of <b>submerged</b> <b>jet</b> impingement boiling for high heat flux, low surface temperature applications. The effect of geometrical and flow parameters on heat transfer performance are examined for a single circular jet using water and FC- 72 as working fluids. Exclusive to {{this study is the}} comparison of distinct jet fluids at a fixed saturation temperature, which is achieved by comparing sub-atmospheric jet impingement boiling data of water with atmospheric FC- 72 experiments. Under sub-atmospheric conditions, the liquid-to-vapor density ratio of water is within a range that has not been studied in previous jet impingement boiling experiments. Varied geometrical parameters include the surface-to-nozzle diameter ratio, surface roughness, and jet configuration. Varied fluidic parameters include pressure, jet exit Reynolds number, fluid subcooling, and fluid properties. Global experimental data collected during this study are used to document the relationship between surface temperature and surface heat flux through boiling curves. The global data are augmented by qualitative high-speed visualization. Experimental data demonstrate enhanced heat transfer capabilities beyond those of pool boiling by using a submerged impinging jet. For a fixed saturation temperature, significantly higher heat transfer rates are attainable using water in comparison to FC- 72. A CHF map for <b>submerged</b> <b>jet</b> impingement boiling is developed based on experimental evidence. A general <b>submerged</b> <b>jet</b> impingement CHF correlation is developed based on a well known CHF model in literature.

40|$|As {{flood water}} is {{discharged}} {{from a high}} dam, low frequency (i. e., lower than 10 Hz) noise (LFN) associated with air pulsation is generated and propagated in the surrounding areas, causing environmental problems such as vibrations of windows and doors and discomfort of residents and construction workers. To study the generation mechanisms and key influencing factors of LFN induced by energy dissipation through <b>submerged</b> <b>jets</b> at a high dam, detailed prototype observations and analyses of LFN are conducted. The discharge flow field is simulated using a gas-liquid turbulent flow model, and the vorticity fluctuation characteristics are then analyzed. The mathematical model for the LFN intensity is developed based on vortex sound theory and a turbulent flow model, verified by prototype observations. The model results reveal that the vorticity fluctuation in strong shear layers around the high-velocity <b>submerged</b> <b>jets</b> is highly correlated with the on-site LFN, and the strong shear layers are the main regions of acoustic source for the LFN. In addition, the predicted and observed magnitudes of LFN intensity agree quite well. This {{is the first time}} that the LFN intensity has been shown to be able to be predicted quantitatively...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{investigations}} on {{the effect}} of cavitation and bubble dynamics on fluid flow with applications to hydraulic valves are carried out. First, the parameter space of a previously developed quasi-one-dimensional model accounting for the coupling between the fluid flow and bubble dynamics is explored. Several flow and geometric parameters are shown to have a considerable effect on the stability of the flow. Second, the commercially available CFD code, FLUENT, which features a recently added cavitation model, is tested for predictions of flashing onset in a converging-diverging axisymmetric nozzle and for cavitation in both a model and industrial spool valve. The results highlight the limitations of such a model for cavitating turbulent flows. Third, a research computer code is developed and tested to study cavitation inception in a planar <b>submerged</b> laminar <b>jet.</b> A direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the Navier-Stokes equations is coupled to a previously published cavitation model which accounts for various aspects of bubble dynamics. The results highlight the effect of cavitation on vortex dynamics in <b>submerged</b> <b>jets</b> and are in qualitative agreement with recent experimental investigations. Finally, DNS of low Reynolds number transitional cavitating <b>submerged</b> <b>jets</b> is conducted. Simulation results are first presented for a round jet under non-cavitating and cavitating conditions to study the effect of cavitation on vortex dynamics in three-dimensions. Cavitation tends to distort the vortical structures and intensify local vorticity and break up the vortex ring into several sections. The influence of non-circular nozzles and swirl on jet vortical structure and its influence on cavitation inception control is also studied. ...|$|R

In this study, scour shape deformation process is computed by the equilibrium sediment transport model because of its simplicity, not emphasizing the rate of absolute sediment transport. The vertical two-dimensional model for the flow in the local scour has been developed, which employs sigma coordinate system to take into account of the variation of water surface, bed height.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the study of a <b>submerged</b> <b>jet</b> for the suction of {{unwanted}} fluid. This <b>submerged</b> <b>jet</b> {{is caused by the}} fluid coming out from a source. The presence of a sink in front of this source facilitates the suction of the fluid depending upon the source and sink flow rates, the axial and lateral separations of the source and sink, and the angle between the axes of the source and sink. The main purpose is the determination of the sink flow rate for 100 % removal of the source fluid as a function of these parameters. The experiments have been carried using a source nozzle 6 mm in diameter and two sizes for the sink pipe diameter: 10 mm and 20 mm. The main diagnostics used are flow visualization using dye and particle image velocimetry (PIV). The dependence of the required suction flow rate to obtain 100 % effectiveness on the suction tube diameter and angle is relatively weak compared to the lateral separation.

The use of <b>submerged</b> <b>jets</b> produced by mixing pumps lowered into the supernatant/sludge interface to produce a homogeneous slurry is being studied at several DOE facilities. The homogeneous slurry can be pumped from the tanks to a treatment facility or alternative storage location. Most of the previous and current studies with this method are for flat-bottom tanks with vertical walls.

40|$|In {{anaerobic}} digesters {{operated in}} a municipal wastewater plant, <b>submerged</b> recirculating <b>jet</b> streams {{are often used}} {{for the purpose of}} agitating sludge. However, due to the complex rheology of the sludge, large portions of the digester can remain stagnant and the stagnant volume changes slowly with time. The rate of change varies with time which is determined by the rheological nature of the sludge. In our previous flow visualisation study involving a downward facing jet recirculating a transparent, non-Newtonian, sludge simulant in a model digester, we have shown that the rate of decrease of inactive volume occurs in three distinct flow regimes. In practice, some of these flow regimes can persist for an undesirably long period of time and delay the acquisition of a fully "active" state within the vessel. Our experiments in the present work carried out using the same sludge simulant reveal that the time-span of the flow regimes can be remarkably shortened by a simple change in the geometry of the recirculating jet.
