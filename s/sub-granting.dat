40|$|This {{report is}} based on {{findings}} from desktop research and interviews with selected foundations conducted between April and June 2016. It was developed to give the Oak Foundation {{a sense of how}} other foundations are tackling monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) questions, and to show a range of options for Oak to consider as it develops its own MEL Plan. This summary of findings was developed for public distribution, anticipating that it may be useful for other donors. Key trends that emerged from the interviews and desktop research included the following: 1. Foundations are spending more resources and putting more staff time into evaluation than they did in the past. Staff at smaller foundations tend to spend more time on individual grant evaluations, while staff at larger foundations tend to spend more time on assessments of broad program areas and on learning processes. While many foundations do not have consistent systems for tracking evaluation spending, some are deciding {{it would be useful to}} capture that information more methodically. 2. Less attention has been put on learning to-date, but recognition of the importance of purposeful learning is growing quickly. Many foundations are hoping to improve upon their learning processes, but finding that it is not easy. It often requires an internal cultural shift and testing a variety of approaches. In contrast, foundations tend to have fairly clear processes and standards for monitoring and evaluation. Foundations that do have explicit learning efforts remain more focused on internal learning rather than communicating and sharing lessons externally. Foundations tend to be more transparent with external audiences about their grant-making processes, goals, and strategies, and less transparent about how they assess performance or their lessons learned. That said, both grantees and foundations are recognizing that sharing more lessons externally would be beneficial. 3. Foundations are exploring appropriate and useful ways to evaluate work done through <b>sub-granting</b> organizations. Some are focusing on building the internal monitoring and evaluation capacity of those organizations. It would be useful for donors to coordinate approaches to evaluate work done through <b>sub-granting</b> organizations, which can allow for pooled resources and avoid putting an extra burden on the subgrantor...|$|E

50|$|Habitants in New France {{were largely}} defined by their {{relationship}} to a seigneur. Seigneurs were primarily nobles or clergy members from France who were given large pieces of land that were referred to as fiefs or seigneuries. Such a system created a traditional peasant-lord relationship by establishing a landed elite.

40|$|Brewing and {{bioethanol}} production {{with raw}} grain and exogenous enzymes produces wort with satisfactory hot water extract (HWE). However, the {{free amino nitrogen}} (FAN) and mineral content can be too low, owing to low protein digestibility (PD) and phytate–mineral chelation, respectively. This study evaluated the potential for improvement in yeast nutrition in raw whole sorghum and maize brewing and bioethanol production by genetic modification (GM) of sorghum to improve PD and reduce phytate content, and by treatment with exogenous phytase. While phytase addition decreased sorghum spent grain phytate content (88 %) and content of minerals (17 to 59 %; i. e. increased wort mineral content), it did not affect maize phytate spent grain mineral content or HWE significantly. However, phytase addition did increase maize wort FAN (20 %), sorghum HWE (2. 8 percentage points) and wort FAN (23 %). GM sorghum gave reduced spent grain mineral contents (11 – 38 %), increased HWE (5. 5 percentage points) and wort FAN (71 %). Hence, genetic modification of sorghum to improve PD and reduce phytate content has considerable potential in raw grain brewing and bioethanol production to improve yeast nutrition.

40|$|Improved iron {{availability}} from sorghum porridges {{will benefit}} many malnourished communities in rural Africa, {{where there is}} a high prevalence of iron deficiency. This research compared the efficacy of reducing sorghum phytate content by genetic modification (GM) and natural lactic acid fermentation on in vitro iron availability in porridges. GM low phytate, non-tannin (38 % phytate reduction) and tannin (36 % phytate reduction) sorghums and their null controls were processed into thick unfermented and fermented porridges. The inhibitory effect of the tannins seemed to prevent any increase in in vitro iron availability, regardless of the level of phytate reduction. Only the additive effect of GM in combination with fermentation in reducing the phytate content appeared to cause a substantial increase in in vitro iron availability in the GM fermented porridge (30 %) made from the non-tannin line, compared to the GM unfermented porridge (8. 9 %) or the fermented porridge (17. 6 %) of the control sorghum. This could be of nutritional significance.

40|$|Under-nutrition {{is a key}} {{underlying}} cause of the 10 million child deaths each year—most of which are preventable and most of which occur in poor countries. The major direct causes of under-nutrition in poor developing countries are insufficient food intake and an unbalanced diet caused by lack of variety in available foods coupled with disease outbreaks. This study shows {{that the majority of}} children living in rural Burkina Faso are severely undernourished {{as a result of the}} low amount of food they consume, their lack of dietary diversity, and, consequently, their low intake of many macro- and micronutrients. Replacement of normal cereal staples with biofortified crops would not affect the amount of food consumed per se. However, the strategy of most biofortification programs is to add nutrients to the most profitable and highest yielding varieties available, which would address, to some extent, the issue of insufficient food availability. For biofortified cereals to make a broad impact on the nutritional status of undernourished children in rural Africa, ideally the predominant cereals consumed should be enhanced with multiple critical nutrientsThe Bill and Melinda Gates Grand Challenges 9, Africa Biofortified Sorghum (ABS) Project through a <b>sub-grant</b> from the Africa Harvest Biotechnology Foundation International.

40|$|Transgenic sorghum (TG) {{lines with}} altered kafirin synthesis, {{particularly}} suppression of γ-kafirin synthesis, and improved protein quality have been developed. The proportion of kafirin extracted with 60 % tert-butyl alcohol alone was greatly {{increased in the}} TG lines. However, {{the total amount of}} kafirin remained unchanged. Further, in the TG lines, the kafirin was much less polymerized by disulfide bonding. There was also evidence of compensatory synthesis of other kafirin proteins. Cooked protein digestibility was increased in the TG form, even after removal of interfering starch. The TG protein bodies were intermediate in appearance between the normal type and the invaginated high digestibility mutants. Hence, the increased protein digestibility of these TG lines is probably related to their lower levels of disulfide-bonded kafirin polymerization, allowing better access of proteases. This work appears to confirm that disulfide bond formation in kafirin is responsible for the reduced protein digestibility of cooked sorghum.

40|$|Stable {{viscoelastic}} masses {{have been}} formed from kafirin in a mainly aqueous system. Kafirin was dissolved in glacial acetic acid (GAA) and simple coacervation was performed by rapid addition of 15 °C water under low shear. Kafirin precipitated out as a network of hydrated fibrils which could be hand-kneaded into a viscoelastic mass. These could be formed from a very wide range of kafirins, including those where β- or γ-subclass expression was suppressed. Kafirin composition influenced {{the appearance of the}} masses but did not fundamentally affect stress-relaxation behaviour. Fresh kafirin masses exhibited similar elasticity and viscous flow balance to gluten. They maintained functionality when stored for several days at 10 °C but their elastic component increased. FTIR showed that when kafirin was dissolved in GAA its α-helical conformation increased substantially. Dissociation of the kafirin molecules in GAA, assuming a α-helical conformation may have enhanced water binding, enabling viscoelastic mass formation. The Howard G.

40|$|Direct and {{opportunity}} costs of regulation are presented for four transgenic {{products in the}} Philippines: Bt eggplant, Bt rice, ringspot-virus-resistant papaya, and virus-resistant tomatoes. Understanding the magnitude of these costs is important for evaluating potential net benefits of genetically modified crops, both for countries that are designing their regulatory procedures and for those implementing them. Results indicate that direct regulatory costs are significant but generally smaller than technology development costs. However, the cost of foregone benefits stemming from even a relatively brief delay in product release, which {{might be due to}} unexpected regulatory delays, overshadows both research and regulatory costs. Regulatory systems must ensure that none of the steps in its regulatory process for GM products that are required to protect public safety and the environment are omitted, but unnecessary steps are costly. Direct regulatory costs appear to be declining within countries as they gain experience with more products.

40|$|Arising {{from work}} showing that {{conventionally}} bred high protein digestibility sorghum types have improved flour and dough functionality, {{the flour and}} dough properties of transgenic biofortified sorghum lines with increased protein digestibility and high lysine content (TG-HD) resulting from suppressed synthesis of several kafirin subclasses, especially the cysteine-rich γ-kafirin, were studied. TG-HD sorghums had higher flour water solubility at 30 °C (p < 0. 05) and much higher paste viscosity (41 % higher) than their null controls (NC). TG-HD doughs were twice as strong as their NC and dynamic rheological analysis indicated that the TG doughs were somewhat more elastic up to 90 °C. CLSM of doughs and pastes indicated that TG-HD had a less compact endosperm protein matrix surround the starch compared to their NC. The improved flour and dough functional properties of the TG-HD sorghums seem {{to be caused by}} reduced endosperm compactness resulting from suppression of synthesis of several kafirin subclasses which modifies protein body and protein matrix structure, and to improved protein-starch interaction through hydrogen bonding specifically caused by reduction in the level of the hydrophobic γ-kafirin. The improved flour functionality of these transgenic biofortified sorghums can increase their commercial utility by complementing their improved nutritional quality. The Howard G.

The {{three types of}} Block Grants are Emergency Shelter Block Grants (ESG), Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and HOME Investment Partnership Block grants (HOME). Sources are {{determined}} through data provided via HUD mandated report titled the Action Plan. Sources consist of annual New Allocations, Program Income and Reprogrammed funds. These Sources are summed and evaluated {{for each of the}} five years, and for a five-year total. Uses are determined by data provided by the Action Plan(s) and another HUD mandated annual report titled the Comprehensive Annual Performance and Evaluation Report(s) (CAPER). Uses are summed and evaluated for each of the five years, and for the five years, and for the five-year total. Specific categories of Use are also reviewed and analyzed, with emphasis placed on USE for Housing Activities. Uses per individual <b>sub-grants</b> (the City of Flint is considered the Grantee) and summed totals are compared and analyzed for discrepancies. The discovery of inconsistency in naming conventions and errors in mathematical computations, necessitated a mid-step of standardizing the data available from the public documents. Accurate knowledge of Use of Block Grant Funds was not possible utilizing only the public documents. The City of Flint Block Grants are then compared with Michigan State Housing Development Authority (MSHDA) grant awards made during this same time period, for Housing Activities, to Flint area organizations. These MSHDA grants are considered to be a means of increasing the funds available for Housing Activities, which is known as leveraging.

40|$|The {{accountability}} of {{non-governmental organisations}} (NGOs) {{is important to}} development work. Judging the performance of an NGO in providing social services and whether it has fulfilled its responsibilities {{with a set of}} standards is increasingly important due to NGOs working more in social development. In Cambodia NGOs have also become actively involved in climate change actions at all levels and have become an important player among other actors to enforce climate policies. While the influential roles of NGOs in climate policy advocacy and negotiation have been recognised, the impact of their involvement in climate change actions at the local level has been less prominent. This poses a question as to how NGO accountability impacts on local communities with the projects that they are carrying out concerning climate change issues. This thesis explored Cambodian NGOs working in partnership on climate change issues and how issues concerning their accountability to local communities can be evaluated. This study involved seventeen NGO representatives from different NGOs who work directly in climate change projects in Cambodia. A qualitative approach was employed using interviews with the participants and this primary data collection was supplemented by documentary evidence from secondary sources. The interviews captured the experience and knowledge of the processes of working in partnership on climate change projects by the research participants. The particpants shared with me some of the benefits and difficulties in working in partnership with other NGOs on climate change issues. From their reflections I was able to discern some key findings. I found that NGO partnership in climate change projects in Cambodia enhances effectiveness and efficiency in project implementation. Partnership strengthens the downward accountability of NGOs in carrying out the projects because inputs and resources are redirected to the ground level of operations and not diverted away from the intended beneficiaries. The partnership movement is grass roots driven, and small local NGOs are able to receive funds and directly benefit local communities. Partnerships enable funding aid to reach the local people through the <b>sub-grant</b> provision scheme. Funding NGOs provide capacity development and technical support throughout the project cycle to their partners so that they can have sufficient capacity to carry out climate change work at the ground level. Partnering NGOs also work with NGO network members in climate change policy advocacy and communication by bringing local voices into the process of policy development. Cambodian NGO partnerships in climate change projects significantly contributes to climate change adaptation actions. I conclude with some recommendations for how this process can be improved...|$|R
