5|$|In {{addition}} to taxonomic research, collections can provide information {{relevant to the}} study of variety of other ornithological questions, including comparative anatomy, ecology, behavior, disease, and conservation. Forensic ornithologists use collections to identify species involved in aircraft bird strikes, imported materials containing bird parts, and birds killed through various human activities, legal and illegal. In addition, collections are used by zooarchaeologists to identify bird bones at prehistoric human sites or <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for feathers used in human cultural artifacts. Collections also have been heavily used by artists, particularly for the production of plates for ornithological field guides. The close-up observation and opportunity for manipulation provided by preserved study skins makes them, together with field observations and photography, to be an important basis for painters of field guide plates of birds. Most bird species have several unique plumages that distinguish immature from adults, males from females, and breeders from non-breeders. Thus, many different specimens may be required to produce a thorough plate for identification of a given species. Accurate colour measurements using spectrometry are possible from specimens.|$|E

5000|$|Of the North American oaks, the {{northern}} red oak {{is the one}} of the most prized of the red oak group for lumber, much of which is marketed as red oak regardless of the <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> It is not good for outdoor use due to its open capillaries unless the wood is treated. If the wood is properly treated with preservatives, it will not rot as quickly as cured white oak heartwood. The closed cell structure of white oaks prevent them from absorbing preservatives. With northern red oak, one can blow air through an end grain piece 10 inches long to make bubbles come out in a glass of water. These openings give fungus easy access when the finish deteriorates. Shumard oak, a member of the red oak subgenus, provides timber which is described as [...] "mechanically superior" [...] to Northern Red oak. Cherrybark oak is another type of red oak which provides excellent timber.|$|E

5000|$|Ivory is a hard, white {{material}} from the tusks (traditionally elephant's) and teeth of animals, {{that can be used}} in art or manufacturing. It consists mainly of dentine (inorganic formula Ca10(PO4)6(CO3)·H2O)), one of the physical structures of teeth and tusks. The chemical structure of the teeth and tusks of mammals is the same, regardless of the <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> The trade in certain teeth and tusks other than elephant is well established and widespread; therefore, [...] "ivory" [...] can correctly be used to describe any mammalian teeth or tusks of commercial interest which are large enough to be carved or scrimshawed. It has been valued since ancient times for making a range of items, from ivory carvings to false teeth, fans, dominoes and joint tubes. Elephant ivory is the most important source, but ivory from mammoth, walrus, hippopotamus, sperm whale, killer whale, narwhal and wart hog are used as well. [...] Elk also have two ivory teeth, which are believed to be the remnants of tusks from their ancestors.|$|E
50|$|The {{study in}} question, however, created {{airborne}} H5N1 via amino acid substitutions that largely mitigated the devastating {{effects of the}} disease. This fact was underscored by the 0% fatality rate among the ferrets infected via airborne transmission, {{as well as the}} fundamental biology underlying the substitutions. Flu viruses attach to host cells via the hemagluttinin proteins on their envelope. These hemagluttinin proteins bind to sialic acid receptors on host cells, which can fall into two categories. The sialic acid receptors can be either 2,3 or 2,6-linked, with the <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> largely deciding receptor preference. In influenzas of avian origin 2,3-linkage is preferred, vs. influenzas of human origin in which 2,6-linkage is preferable. 2,3-linked SA receptors in humans are found predominantly in the lower respiratory tract, a fact that is the primary foundation for the deadliness of avian influenzas in humans, and also the key to their lack of airborne transmission. In the study that created an airborne avian influenza among ferrets it was necessary to switch the receptor preference of the host cells to those of 2,6-linkage, found predominantly in humans' upper respiratory tract, in order to create an infection that could shed aerosolized virus particles. Such an infection, however, must occur in the upper respiratory tract of humans, thus fundamentally undercutting the fatal trajectory of the disease.|$|E
40|$|Determining the <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> of {{skeletal}} remains {{is critical in}} a forensic and anthropologic context. However, {{there are very few}} methods that use a chemical approach to assist in this determination. In this study, Raman spectroscopy was used to discriminate bone samples originating from four different species (bovine, porcine, turkey and chicken). Spectra were obtained using a near infrared laser at 785 -nm. All spectra were combined in a single matrix and processed using partial least squares discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) with leave-one-out cross-validation. Three com-ponents were found to adequately describe the system. The first two components which contributed over 85 % of spec-tral data was seen to completely separate the four <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> in a two dimensional scores plot. A 95 % confidence interval was draw around score points of each species class with very slight overlap. The first two components were seen to have large contributions from bioapatite and collagen, the main components of bone. This study serves as a preliminary investigation {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} Raman spectroscopy to discriminate the <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> of bone tissue...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Occult {{organizational}} structures in DNA sequences {{may hold the}} key to understanding functional and evolutionary aspects of the DNA molecule. Such structures can also provide the means for identifying and discriminating organisms using genomic data. Species specific genomic signatures are useful in a variety of contexts such as evolutionary analysis, assembly and classification of genomic sequences from large uncultivated microbial communities and a rapid identification system in health hazard situations. Results We have analyzed genomic sequences of eukaryotic and prokaryotic chromosomes as well as various subtypes of viruses using an information theoretic framework. We confirm the existence of a species specific average mutual information (AMI) profile. We use these profiles to define a very simple, computationally efficient, alignment free, distance measure that reflects the evolutionary relationships between genomic sequences. We use this distance measure to classify chromosomes according to <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> to separate and cluster subtypes of the HIV- 1 virus, and classify DNA fragments to <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> Conclusion AMI profiles of DNA sequences prove to be species specific and easy to compute. The structure of AMI profiles are conserved, even in short subsequences of a species' genome, rendering a pervasive signature. This signature can be used to classify relatively short DNA fragments to <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{explored the}} utility of mean osteon area, perimeter, and circularity as parameters for distinguishing between human and non-human bone. Although <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> can be readily ascribed to undamaged remains, this evaluation can become difficult, if not impossible, when bone macrostructure has been obscured through taphonomic processes such as thermal alteration or extreme fragmentation. If mature Ovis aries, domestic sheep, and human osteon metrics area are significantly different, then osteon metrics can be useful parameters for distinguishing between these tissues and, thus, determining the <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for a bone sample of unknown provenience. This investigation consisted of histological analysis of cortical bone from 35 O. aries rib samples. O. aries samples were acquired from Riverslea Farm in Epping, New Hampshire (n = 30) and Cedar Ledge Farm in Somers, Connecticut (n = 5). Mean osteon area, perimeter, and circularity were assessed by manually tracing calibrated digital images of rib cross-sections using the ImageJ software from the National Institute of Health (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The results presented here indicate (1) that there are statistically significant histomorphometric differences between species, specifically goat and sheep, (2) that there are significant histomorphometric differences based on the anatomical, intra-rib sampling location, and (3) that the osteon metrics discussed here are may be poor parameters by which to ascribe the <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for remains with no known provenience, based on comparisons with findings from other publications...|$|E
