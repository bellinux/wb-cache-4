2500|$|A Fresnel lantern (UK), {{or simply}} Fresnel (US), employs a Fresnel lens to wash light over {{an area of}} the stage. The lens is named after French {{physicist}} Augustin-Jean Fresnel, and consequently pronounced with a silent [...] "s". The distinctive lens has a 'stepped' appearance instead of the 'full' or 'smooth' appearance of those used in other lanterns. The resulting beam of light is wide and soft-edged, creating soft shadows, and is commonly used for back light, top light, and side light. Another method of controlling the spread of light is to use either a top hat (also referred to as a <b>snoot),</b> which generally limits the light coming out, or a barn door, whose flaps work as though they were shutters on an ERS (shown on the right). These methods limit light output and keep excess light from spilling into the eyes of audience members or where it is not desired.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{the newer}} term [...] "WASP," [...] the old term [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] was used derisively by writers hostile to an {{informal}} alliance between Britain and the U.S. The negative use was especially common among Irish Americans and writers in France. [...] "Anglo-Saxon", meaning in effect the whole Anglosphere, remains a term {{favored by the}} French, used disapprovingly in contexts such as criticism of the Special Relationship of close diplomatic relations between the US and Britain and complaints about perceived [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] cultural or political dominance. It also remains in use in Ireland as a term for the British or English, and sometimes in Scottish Nationalist discourse. Irish-American humorist Finley Peter Dunne popularized the ridicule of [...] "Anglo Saxon", even calling President Theodore Roosevelt one. Roosevelt insisted he was Dutch. [...] "To be genuinely Irish is to challenge WASP dominance," [...] argues California politician Tom Hayden. The depiction of the Irish in the films of John Ford was a counterpoint to WASP standards of rectitude. [...] "The procession of rambunctious and feckless Celts through Ford's films, Irish and otherwise, was meant to cock a <b>snoot</b> at WASP or 'lace-curtain Irish' ideas of respectability." ...|$|E

Fighting again resumed for another hour and half until 7 a.m. before surrender was demanded for again.

5000|$|The Arnold Wesker Ventriloquist {{appears in}} The Batman, {{where he and}} Scarface are both voiced by Dan Castellaneta. In the series, Wesker is a ventriloquist who snapped when he was booed off the stage one night and turned {{to a life of}} crime with his first {{successful}} act being the robbery of each and every person in the audience who had booed him. Scarface's costume is updated to one reminiscent of that worn by Al Pacino in Scarface. In his debut episode [...] "The Big Dummy", Wesker arranges for the theft of various gadgets which are used to construct a giant Scarface robot which holds Wesker in its hand in a reversal of their roles. However, Scarface still needs Wesker to actually move and talk as he is just an oversized [...] "Dummy." [...] In the end, Scarface is destroyed when he is run over by a train. Wesker is then taken to Arkham Asylum. In the episode [...] "Fistful of Felt," [...] Wesker returns with a rebuilt Scarface. It is then revealed that Wesker once had a TV show called Cockamanee Junction which was cancelled. After Batman prevents them from stealing dollar molds from a treasury, Wesker and Scarface are seen in Arkham during Hugo Strange's therapy group with the Joker and Penguin. Strange considers Wesker his main patient and [...] "frees" [...] Wesker from Scarface by simply removing the puppet and prohibiting access to him. Wesker seems to recover and starts to do kids' parties with a puppet named Mr. <b>Snoots</b> until Strange begins the next phase of his plan. He places Scarface in Wesker's apartment, perhaps to see if Wesker is completely cured and able to stand up to Scarface's overbearing demands. Upon seeing the puppet, the voice of Scarface begins to speak from the dummy. In a confrontation with Batman in a newly opened building for children, the Mr. <b>Snoots</b> puppet confronts Scarface. Scarface and Mr. <b>Snoots</b> start fighting and are both once again destroyed by a train. Wesker is then returned to Arkham. In [...] "Rumors," [...] Wesker and Scarface are among the villains captured by Rumor and have been placed in separate cells. Wesker and Scarface both make their final appearance in the series in the season five episode [...] "The End of The Batman", being assisted by Wrath and Scorn.|$|R

50|$|Founded in 1946 by {{community}} leaders, the South Florida Museum opened in 1947 on Bradenton's Memorial Pier with the Montague Tallant collection of Florida's First Peoples pre- and immediate post-contact archaeological material {{as well as}} collections relating to the scientific and cultural history of southwest Florida and Manatee County. The Museum emerged as a leading cultural organization in the community, providing educational programs and field trips {{to tens of thousands}} of students through the years.

50|$|Most lights used {{in modern}} {{photography}} are {{a flash of}} some sort. The lighting for portraiture is typically diffused by bouncing it {{from the inside of}} an umbrella, or by using a soft box. A soft box is a fabric box, encasing a photo strobe head, one side of which is made of translucent fabric. This provides a softer lighting for portrait work and is often considered more appealing than the harsh light often cast by open strobes. Hair and background lights are usually not diffused. It is more important to control light spillage to other areas of the subject. <b>Snoots,</b> barn doors and flags or gobos help focus the lights exactly where the photographer wants them. Background lights are sometimes used with color gels placed in front of the light to create coloured backgrounds.|$|R

50|$|The comics {{industry}} {{experienced a}} downswing in the 1970s and Gold Key {{was among the}} hardest hit.

5000|$|Further South, {{barbecue}} has its {{own style}} in places in Kansas and St. Louis that are different to the South and the American West. Kansas City and St. Louis were and remain important hubs for the railroad that connected the plains with the Great Lakes and cities farther east, like Philadelphia. At {{the turn of the}} 19th century, the St. Louis area, Omaha, and Kansas City had huge stockyards, waystations for cattle and pigs on their way East to the cities of the coast and North to the Great Lakes. They all had large growing immigrant and migrant populations from Europe and the South respectively, so this region has developed unique styles of barbecue. St. Louis-style barbecue favors a heavy emphasis on a sticky sweet barbecue sauce. Its standbys include the pork steak, a cut taken from the shoulder of the pig, grilled, and then slowly stewed in a pan over charcoal, crispy <b>snoots,</b> a cut from the cheek and nose of the pig that is fried up like cracklin and eaten dipped in sauce, pork spare ribs, and a mix of either beer boiled bratwurst or grilled Italian derived sausage, flavored with fennel. Dessert is usually something like gooey butter cake, invented in the city in the 1930s. Kansas City-style barbecue uses several different kinds of meat, more than most styles of American barbecue- turkey, mutton, pork, and beef just to name a few- but is distinct from St. Louis in that the barbecue sauce adds molasses in with the typical tomato based recipe and typically has a more tart taste. Traditionally, Kansas City uses a low-and-slow method of smoking the meat in addition to just stewing it in the sauce. It also favors using hickory would for smoking and continual watering or layering of the sauce while cooking to form a glaze; with burnt ends this step is necessary to create the [...] "bark" [...] or charred outer layer of the brisket.|$|R
