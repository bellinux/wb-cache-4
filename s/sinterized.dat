The precursors (oxidizing and reductors) are mixed in aqueous solution to form powders after ignition and burn. The samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction, photoluminescence and IR fluorescence. The x-ray analyses of the <b>sinterized</b> powders at the temperature range 600 oC- 1200 oC in muffle oven, shows that all the samples present a cubic structure belong Fm 3 m space group with mean crystallites sizes diameters {{of the order of}} 35 nm. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed for all the compositions an agglomerated globular morphology with sub-micron dimensions. The luminescence spectra’s presented by Eu+ 3 ions for all the analyzed samples is characteristic of octahedrical symmetry, showing a monotonic increase of the intensities with Eu 3 + concentration for thermal treatment in the range 800 oC- 1000 oC. For the oxide samples <b>sinterized</b> in the temperature range 1000 oC- 1200 oC, with Eu 3 + concentration of 2 % and 4 %wt quenching of the luminescence was observed. On the other hand in the 8 %wt Eu 3 +-doped samples sinterisized at 1100 oC for 6 hs present higher intensities. This behavior can be correlated to the appearance of the super structure planes in the samples with the increasing sintering temperature...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades the {{bioactive}} ceramics including bioglasses, glass-ceramics, sintered hydroxyapatite, become one of the major fields in biomaterials., due to their intimate bond with living bone through the formation of a biologically active carbonate apatite interface layer. The purpose of the work was to examine the structure of a calcium silicate bioactive glass prepared by the sol-gel method. The samples were characterized by thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). No traces of organic matter or nitrates in the stabilized material were found according to FTIR and TG/DTA measurements. The materials produced are amorphous even after stabilization at 700 degrees C up to about 850 degrees C. However, the materials <b>sinterized</b> at 1000 degrees C for 1 hour reveal crystalline phase and indeed that of CaSiO 3 (wollastonite). Thus, the materials prepared by the sol-gel method are homogeneous with high purity and after their stabilization below their crystallization temperature, they are amorphous. These characteristics allow their application in the area of orthopedic and dental implants as a bone substitute biomaterial...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{increasing}} demand of PM parts for automobile and aerospace applications {{has caused a}} strong development of the aluminium based metal matrix composites (MMCs). Aluminium alloys are one of most widely used materials as matrix in MMCs, both {{in research and development}} as well as in industrial applications. The main reason is the combination of good specific properties, the first requirement in most applications, and the competitive price compared to other low density alloys such as Mg or Ti alloys. In the present work, the influence of the ceramic reinforcement addition to a 2 xxx series aluminium alloy is studied. Several percentages of TiCN {{have been added to the}} Al-Cu alloy using PM techniques, in order to analyze its influence on the liquid phase sintering process and also on the final properties of the material. The materials have been uniaxially compacted using two different pressures to determine the optimal pressing condition. They have been subsequently <b>sinterized</b> in a N 2 -H 2 atmosphere. Analysing the results obtained, it can be concluded that the addition of TiCN allows a better distribution of the liquid phase up to the 10 %wt, where the optimal results are observed: For higher quantities of reinforcement, elemental copper is observed in the microstructure with the consequent decrease in densification...|$|E
40|$|The {{generator}} potential {{was recorded}} in the sensory organ of frog semicircular canals and some dynamic deviations from the Steinhausen's pendulum model due to adaptation were investigated. A suitable turntable enabled controlled ramps, steps and sinusoids of angular velocity {{to be applied to}} isolated labyrinths. Suction electrodes provided with <b>sinterized</b> Ag/AgCl tablets allowed stable DC recordings from distal stump of cut ampullary nerve. Substantial evidence is presented that an ion transport is activated in ampullary nerve fibres during excitation which is able of shifting the reference level, thus producing adaptation and related distortions. In fact the dynamics between the expected cupula position and time course in generator potential became remarkably reduced in the following conditions: a) - when Li was substituted for Na in the saline; b) - in the presence of Ouabain. 02 mM/ml; c) - in solutions where K was lacking; d) - in the presence of DNP. 2 mM/ml. An electroneutral pump shifting toward more negativity the K-equilibrium potential by an intense reabsorption of potassium, or, more probably, an electrogenic Na-pump which directly hyperpolarizes the membrane by driving a net positive charge outwards might produce the observed deviations from an overdamped behavior. Since the time course of the decline in the responses was maintained in the presence of TTX. 1 microg/ml, any possible relation between the pump and the spikes arising at the encoder may be ruled out. The pump therefore should operate at the ultimate fibre endings where a consistent Na inward flux is expected during the activation of postsynaptic terminals...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of metal oxides from investment dies on the color of metal-free VM 7 ceramic. Materials and Methods: Forty circular patterns were made with an elastic gelatin duplicator. These were divided into four groups (n = 10) for pouring the investment: G 1, Begoform (Bego); G 2, Ducera Lay Superfit (DeguDent GmbH); G 3, Duravest (Polidental), and G 4, Refrax Magnum (CNG). Refractory dies were subjected to the degassing process for gas and metal oxide elimination, and the testing was done with the application of two layers of VM 7 ceramic. These layers were <b>sinterized</b> in accordance with the manufacturer′s recommendation and then glazed. For the control group, 10 additional VM 7 ceramic discs were made without the use of any investment die. The ceramic′s control color and the tested groups were analyzed with the aid of a portable colorimeter (Minolta CR- 10) in the CIELab. The color change (ΔE) of the specimens from the tested groups was obtained, and the data were submitted to one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey′s test. Results: All tested groups had a color change from the control group. G 1 (5, 3) and G 2 (5, 3) were those that showed the greater color change and did not show statistical differences between themselves; G 3 (3, 3) and G 4 (3, 1) were those that showed the least color change from control group and did not show statistical differences between themselves. Conclusion: Once all investments present a perceptible color change from the control group, color selection should be done with a laboratory-produced color scale...|$|E
40|$|Purpose This paper aims {{to address}} the {{numerical}} simulation of additive manufacturing (AM) processes. The numerical results are compared with the experimental campaign carried out at State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing laboratories, where a laser solid forming machine, {{also referred to as}} laser engineered net shaping, is used to fabricate metal parts directly from computer-aided design models. Ti- 6 Al- 4 V metal powder is injected into the molten pool created by a focused, high-energy laser beam and a layer of added material is <b>sinterized</b> according to the laser scanning pattern specified by the user. Design/methodology/approach The numerical model adopts an apropos finite element (FE) activation technology, which reproduces the same scanning pattern set for the numerical control system of the AM machine. This consists of a complex sequence of polylines, used to define the contour of the component, and hatches patterns to fill the inner section. The full sequence is given through the common layer interface format, a standard format for different manufacturing processes such as rapid prototyping, shape metal deposition or machining processes, among others. The result is a layer-by-layer metal deposition which can be used to build-up complex structures for components such as turbine blades, aircraft stiffeners, cooling systems or medical implants, among others. Findings Ad hoc FE framework for the numerical simulation of the AM process by metal deposition is introduced. Description of the calibration procedure adopted is presented. Originality/value The objectives of this paper are twofold: firstly, this work is intended to calibrate the software for the numerical simulation of the AM process, to achieve high accuracy. Secondly, the sensitivity of the numerical model to the process parameters and modeling data is analyzed. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|E

40|$|Este trabajo {{describe}} la síntesis de hexaferrita de bario, con buenos rendimientos, por un nuevo método de síntesis por vía húmeda. El precursor se obtiene por la adición de cloruro de bario a una solución de ferrato de sodio fuertemente alcalina (preparada por la oxidación del cloruro férrico por cloro en medio alcalino). Este precursor está formado, esencialmente, por ferrihidrita e hidróxido de bario cristalino, sin descartar la presencia de goetita y otros óxidos mixtos de bario y de hierro. El tratamiento térmico del precursor conduce a la formación de partículas de hexaferrita de bario a muy bajas temperaturas (~ 700 °C); es la más baja temperatura informada en la preparación de este compuesto. Las partículas de la hexaferrita de bario tienen forma de plateletas con un diámetro basal del orden de 0, 5 μm. Se emplearon diferentes técnicas para seguir la transformación térmica del precursor: difracción de rayos X, espectroscopía Mössbauer, microscopía electrónica de barrido, espectroscopía infrarroja, métodos dispersivos en energía, análisis termogravimétrico y análisis térmico diferencial. La cristalización ocurre a temperaturas relativamente bajas y los cristalitos formados alcanzan tamaños del orden de 50 nm a 800 °C. La única fase cristalina que se detecta en el precursor es el Ba(OH) 2; los otros picos de difracción corresponden a la ferrihidrita. Mediante el tratamiento térmico se forma la hexaferrita como única fase; sólo se detecta la presencia de monoferrita de bario cuando el calentamiento es prolongado y se realiza a una temperatura máxima relativamente baja (800 °C), particles grow quasiexponentially, due to sintering. Thus, {{particles of}} the obtained hexaferrite {{are composed of}} arrays of ordered crystallites, that resemble crystallographic habit. The water contents of the precursor is {{of the order of}} 16 %, in good agreement with the X-ray diffraction observations. Water is lost in several, poorly resolved stages, the last of which coincides with the final crystallisation stage. The FTIR spectrum of the precursor is dominated by the bands assigned to ferrihydrite, and carbonate is shown to be practically absent. The Mössbauer spectra of the heated samples show the evolution from ferrihydrite to barium hexaferrite, in the form of changes from spectra dominated by broads doublets attributable to superparamagnetic small particles with characteristic HFD’s, to well resolved sets of sextuples characteristic of the hexaferrite. The occupancy of the different iron(III) crystallographic sites could be derived from the spectra, and the final product shows a good distribution of iron in the sites, as required for a material with good magnetic properties. The characteristics of the precursor and of its thermal evolution are discussed {{on the basis of the}} chosen synthetic route, which is shown to be adequate in view of the solution and crystal chemistry of the involved ions. The macroscopic magnetic properties of the synthesised material were measured using a SQUID magnetometer. In particular, attention was given to the influence of the starting Fe:Ba stoichiometric ratio; the results show that the best properties are obtained when some barium excess is used in the preparative stage. This result is discussed in terms of loss of material, and of the ease of crystallisation of the precursor. Under these conditions, some surface barium monoferrite may form, that can be easily removed by washing with hydrochloric acid. The magnetic parameters of the synthesised hexaferrite were: Ms = 7 l emu g^- 1; Mr = 39, 9 emu g^- 1; Hc = 4400 Oe; and in <b>sinterized</b> hexaferrite |BH| máx. = 1, 3 MG Oe. These figures correspond to an excellent magnetic material, very swell suited for magnetic information recording. These properties are influenced by the magnetic anisotropy of the material, and the contribution of various forms of anisotropy was assessed by measuring the hysteresis cycle of the material diluted in alumina. The results, together with the results of MEB examination, demonstrate that the dilution by simple mixing is difficult to achieve, because the magnetic particles tend to agglomerate, and dilution is not homogeneous, except perhaps in the highest dilution limits. Because of the use of a wet synthetic method, the stability of barium hexaferrite in contact with aqueous solutions was also studied. The available thermodynamic data was critically assessed, and complemented with semiquantitative solubility determinations, in order to derive the phase diagram Fe 203 + BaO + H 20 + HCl (or NaOH), and find the ranges of stability of the hexaferrite, and the ranges in which congruent and incongruent dissolution stoichiometries could be expected. It is shown that in highly acid media, and especially when the ratio solid:liquid is low, total dissolution may take place, whereas in weakly acidic media the most important reaction is the transformation of the hexaferrite in hematite (or goethite), with dissolution of the barium. In alkaline media, modest dissolved barium concentrations (that depend on pH) suffice to stabilise the hexaferrite. The kinetics of hexaferrite attack by acid solutions was measured; the results demonstrate that the process starts through the leaching of barium from a layer of the order of 15 nm. The following process is the slower dissolution of iron, accompanied by further barium leaching from inner layers; accordingly, the kinetic of iron dissolution are linear, whereas those of barium, at the lowest pH (2, 4) are desacelerator. At higher pH, the iron concentration eventually approaches the solubility limit, and iron dissolution is consequently arrested. Dissolution of barium is also slowed down, although it never reaches zero velocity; diffusion though layers growing in thickness and changing in diffusivity is diagnosed. In this range, data suggest that the S blocks of the ferrite structure may actually never dissolve, but act as nucleation centres for the growth of iron oxide layers, incorporating Fe(III) ions dissolved from the R blocks. The nature of the solids subjected to extensive acid attack was studied by Mössbauer spectroscopy; no other solid phases could be detected, in agreement with the implications of the kinetic studies; also, no preferential removal of any of the five crystallographically different iron ions could be detected. Fr comparison, the kinetics of dissolution of the monoferrite were also measured. The rates are larger; although barium leaching is also observed, the lesser passivity of the iron oxide layer leads easily to a behaviour that approaches congruent dissolution; probably, the non-existence of purely ferric structural blocks in the monoferrite are responsible for the difference. Consequently, whenever the monoferrite is formed in the course of hexaferrite synthesis, removal by acid washing is adequate. Fil:Jabobo, Silvia Elena. Universidad de Buenos Aires.
