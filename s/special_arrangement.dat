5|$|While an undergraduate, she {{did some}} {{practice}} {{teaching at the}} Chinese high school in town shortly before graduating in 1952. She had won a scholarship to study music at the Philippine Women's University under Maestra Adoracion Reyes, {{a close friend of}} Imelda's cousin, Loreto Romualdez Ramos. She had a job at a music store but left this for a better one at the Central Bank. Straight from the Central Bank, she hurried to the University every day. After a few lessons, Adoracion was convinced Imelda had talent and persuaded her to enroll at the College of Music and Fine Arts at PWU, under a <b>special</b> <b>arrangement</b> that would put her on register while Adoracion would continue to give her free lessons.|$|E
5|$|In the European Union, animal {{sources are}} governed by Council Directive 86/609/EEC, which {{requires}} lab animals to be specially bred, unless the animal has been lawfully imported {{and is not a}} wild animal or a stray. The latter requirement may also be exempted by <b>special</b> <b>arrangement.</b> In 2010 the Directive was revised with EU Directive 2010/63/EU. In the UK, most animals used in experiments are bred for the purpose under the 1988 Animal Protection Act, but wild-caught primates may be used if exceptional and specific justification can be established. The United States also allows the use of wild-caught primates; between 1995 and 1999, 1,580 wild baboons were imported into the U.S. Over half the primates imported between 1995 and 2000 were handled by Charles River Laboratories, or by Covance, which is the single largest importer of primates into the U.S.|$|E

25|$|Men in the Haredi {{community}} {{may choose to}} defer service while enrolled in yeshivot (see Tal committee); many avoid conscription altogether.

25|$|Upon signing for Chelsea, Tindall {{negotiated}} a <b>special</b> <b>arrangement</b> with the club, whereby {{he was allowed}} to miss the first and last months of the football season to play cricket for Surrey.

25|$|David Freidel and F. Kent Reilly III proposed, in 2010, that, {{rather than}} a unique script, the Cascajal Block in fact {{represents}} a <b>special</b> <b>arrangement</b> of sacred objects used in ancient times for magical purposes. They propose that the incised symbols on the block represent the contents of three sacred bundles arranged in three separate registers {{from top to bottom}}. These sacred bundles include well known objects used in magic and divination rituals. Many of these objects/signs, arranged horizontally within the registers, are present in all three registers. The whole block is to be read in boustrophedon fashion from top to bottom and alternatively left to right and right to left. Freidel and Reilly argue {{that the majority of the}} symbols on the block are found in the established corpus of Middle Formative art and many are otherwise part of iconographically comprehensible compositions that are designed to be read pictographically and not as script encoding spoken language. Rather than to regard the Cascajal Block as an epistemological dead-end—the conclusion if it is identified as a unique script—they identify the block as a key to understanding a <b>special</b> <b>arrangement</b> of sacred objects presented in the course of a religious ritual. The purpose of this may have been to memorialize the acts of divination or other magical rituals. This was a pervasive ritual practice well attested in the archaeology of Formative period Mesoamerica.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} three-act version {{received its}} American premiere in Boston in a production by Zeitgeist Stage Company at the Boston Center for the Arts Plaza Theater in October 2008 through a <b>special</b> <b>arrangement</b> with the playwright. The director was David J. Miller, with lights by Jeff Adelberg, costumes by Fabian Aguilar, fights & movement by Meron Langsner, and sound by Walter Eduardo. The cast consisted of Michelle Dowd as Nancy (who won an IRNE Award for Best Actress for the role), Peter Brown as Charlie, Claude Del as Leslie, and Emma Goodman as Sarah. The original second act is set entirely underwater.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, a <b>special</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{was made}} to {{accommodate}} Jewish services on the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement. This led to a hand-grenade being thrown on the stairway leading to the tomb on October 9; 47 Israelis were injured, 8 seriously. On November 4, a large explosion went off near {{the gate to the}} compound and 6 people, Jews and Arabs, were wounded. On Yom Kippur eve, October 3, 1976, an Arab mob destroyed several Torah scrolls and prayer books at the tomb. In May 1980, an attack on Jewish worshippers returning from prayers at the tomb left 6 dead and 17 wounded.|$|E

25|$|As with {{television}} stations, radio callsigns in Canada {{are made up}} of four letters beginning with the two-letter combinations of CF, CH, CI, CJ, or CK, although a few stations use three-letter callsigns. In addition to private stations CKX and CKY, some CBC stations have three-letter callsigns, generally in major cities where the stations first aired in the 1930s. Newer CBC stations have normal four-letter callsigns, however. As with CBC television, CBC radio uses callsigns beginning with CB, through a <b>special</b> <b>arrangement</b> with the government of Chile. A few exceptions, such as CKSB in Winnipeg and CJBC in Toronto, exist where the CBC acquired an existing station with a historically significant callsign.|$|E
25|$|From the outset, it was {{conceived}} of as a combined educational centre and a residential quarter for families associated with the then-nascent Yeshivat Har Etzion hesder yeshiva, an institution that by <b>special</b> <b>arrangement</b> with the government combines a five-year programme of religious study with army service. Graduates from these Gush Etzion yeshivot make up a disproportionately high percentage of fighting men in the elite units of Israel Defense Forces. It developed as a communal and service center in a predominantly agricultural region. For many years Alon Shvut housed the only health clinic, grocery, post office and bank in the area. It is currently classed as a Jewish locality, the only settlement in Gush Etzion to have that status.|$|E
25|$|He succeeded David Abeel as the ASFS's {{chaplain}} at Huangpu ("Whampoa") {{on what is}} now Pazhou. At the time, {{there were}} 42 ships at Whampoa, with about 2000 Britons, Americans, and Dutch, {{all of whom were}} generally limited to the three islands of Pazhou ("Whampoa"), Xiaoguwei ("French Island"), and Changzhou ("Dane's Island"). There were also another 20 ships and 900 seamen at Nei Lingding. Stevens also served as a chaplain to the foreigners resident at Guangzhou's Thirteen Factories trading ghetto and worked under a <b>special</b> <b>arrangement</b> which also placed him {{under the supervision of the}} American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. He worked with the ABCFM's missionary Elijah Bridgman and printer Samuel Wells Williams until 1836. The three welcomed Peter Parker at his arrival on 26 October 1834. Stevens learned some Chinese and wrote essays published in the Chinese Repository.|$|E
