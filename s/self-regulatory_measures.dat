40|$|The City Code on Takeovers and Mergers has {{generally}} been lauded as a system of self-regulation that offers the advantages of speed, flexibility and low cost administration by experts. Many of its provisions are uncontroversial and do indeed reflect a consensus view about {{the way in which}} takeovers should be carried out. However, the Code 2 ̆ 7 s prohibition on defensive measures by management {{in the event of a}} takeover is far more controversial. This article argues that the City Code – and the prohibition on defensive measures in particular - was introduced because the common law had demonstrated itself incapable of putting in place a system of takeover regulation that ensured the takeover remained a viable means of ensuring managerial accountability to shareholders. Its introduction in 1968 fundamentally transformed the UK 2 ̆ 7 s system of corporate governance. Through its prohibition on defensive measures once a takeover becomes imminent, the Code truncates the general management discretion that lies at the heart of company law and forces management to focus on the generation of short-term shareholder value. What is striking is that this fundamental reorientation of the way in which companies are controlled was brought about not by an Act of Parliament but by a <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>measure</b> put in place by financial institutions. Following the implementation of the Takeover Directive, which itself was heavily influenced by the City Code, the Companies Act 2006 now requires the Takeover Panel to maintain that prohibition...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} and market introduction of ion-specific sensors, like the {{ion selective electrode}} (ISE) and ion selective field effect transistor (ISFET) sensor, has {{paved the way for}} completely new systems for application of fertilisers to crops in greenhouses. This paper illustrates the usefulness of these sensors, by elaborating on a new fertigation strategy in greenhouses aiming at less pollution, more efficient use of fertilisers and eventually, crop quality control. The basic idea of this strategy is to keep the concentration of the individual ions in the drainage water of a set of plants constant at a level that is non-limiting to ion-transport and nutrient uptake. In this way, the uptake of ions by the plants is intrinsically compensated for, thus, satisfying the demand of the plant by exploiting its <b>self-regulatory</b> behaviour. <b>Measuring</b> ion concentrations also enables the design of even more advanced feedback-controlled nutrient dispensers, functioning {{on the basis of a}} model-based control strategy that uses sensors connected to the plant...|$|R

To this end, children were involved in learning two five-skill trampoline routines. For one of the routines, a FSM video was provided during acquisition, whereas only verbal instructions were provided for the alternate routine. The FSM involved editing video footage such that it showed the learner performing the trampoline routine at a higher skill level than their current capability. Analyses of the data showed that while physical performance benefits were observed for the routine that was learned with the FSM video, no differences were obtained in relation to the <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>measures.</b> Thus, the FSM video enhanced motor skill acquisition, but this could not be explained by changes to the varied self-regulatory processes examined...|$|E

To this end, the original (SRCvoc) questionnaire (Tseng, Dornyei, & Schmitt, 2006) was translated into Persian, using a translation/back-translation procedure. Then, the Persian version of the SRCVOC was piloted to 43 high school students and showed acceptable internal consistency reliability (α =. 81). In the main phase of the study, a sample of 1167 high school students (grades 9 - 12) from fifteen high schools in three Iranian cities completed the Persian SRCvoc. Based on the results, the Persian version of the scale demonstrated acceptable internal consistency reliability (α = 0. 81). The factor structure of the translated version of the measure was investigated through a series of factor analyses. The results showed that the translated SVLSQ is composed of one dimension with five subcomponents, with a different factor structure as compared to the original questionnaire.

40|$|Sexual {{harassment}} {{is a complex}} and evolving practice. The rise of sexual discrimination in cyberspace {{is only one of}} the most recent and most striking examples of the phenomenon 2 ̆ 7 s increasing complexity. Sexual harassment law, however, has not kept pace with this evolution. Discrimination law has not been adequately 2 ̆ 2 updated 2 ̆ 2 to address new and amplified practices of sex discrimination. Its two principal limitations are (1) it treats only sexual harassment that occurs in certain protected settings (e. g. the workplace or school) as actionable and (2) it assumes that both the activity and the resulting harm of sexual harassment occur in the same protected setting. Thus, it is unable to address any harassment that occurs completely or partially outside of traditionally protected settings. By contrast, this Article proposes a 2 ̆ 2 multiple-setting 2 ̆ 2 conception of sexual harassment that both moves beyond traditionally protected settings and explicitly acknowledges that sexual harassment in one setting can produce harms in another. In order to address multiple-setting harassment, a third-party liability regime similar to that of traditional sexual harassment law should be introduced into nontraditional contexts. In the particular case of online harassment, liability should attach to website operators. This regime will create an incentive for website operators to adopt preemptive, <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> against online sexual harassment, much as employers have done in the offline setting...|$|E
40|$|Background: Access to temptation {{is blamed}} for the rising {{prevalence}} of obesity in children. A popular way to counter this is to restrict physical access to temptation. As restrictions cannot be widely applied and may have adverse long-term effects, we examine whether accessible temptations in situations that endorse self-regulation train self-regulation. Specifically, we design a method that enhances children's self-regulatory skills in the long term. Method: In two studies, participants were exposed to temptation in phase one and their <b>self-regulatory</b> skills were <b>measured</b> in phase two. In Study 1, we endorsed self-regulation {{in the presence of}} accessible temptation for four consecutive days and measured consumption on the fifth day. In Study 2, we exposed children to temptation similarly and, in addition, manipulated temptation strength to show that being tempted is crucial for the skill to develop. Next, we measured saliva and preferences. Results: The findings suggest that exposure to temptation in a situation that supports self-regulation leads to better resistance to temptations in later contexts of accessible temptation in girls, but not boys. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that interventions aiming at strengthening children's self-regulatory skills through controlled exposure to temptation might be a productive long-term strategy to reduce consumption of unhealthy food...|$|R
40|$|Current discourses in science, {{technology}} and innovation policy describe {{a shift from}} formal, governmental, or statutory regulation to non-hierarchical, informal, and cooperative self-regulatory approaches. They narrate a turn from government to governance, described as a “governance turn. ” Governance as a new and popular mode of regulation, deliberation and shared responsibility is often linked to favored attributes {{of science and technology}} development, and policy making such as democracy and responsibility. This article analyzes the connection between governance and ideas of accountable and democratic science and technology development in the case of nanosciences and nanotechnologies. For this purpose, soft law <b>measures,</b> <b>self-regulatory</b> initiatives, and public engagement projects in Europe and the U.

The study showed that most of the analyzed governance approaches and engagement projects only partially met aspects of social robustness, and that the governance and deliberative turn in science and technology policy has not led, so far, to greater democracy and responsibility in nanoscience and nanotechnology development. As a consequence, the delegation of techno-political decision making to less socially robust governance approaches might lead to a vacuum in science and technology policy and affect not only academic knowledge production but also the innovative force of a society...|$|R

Based on developmental and psychobiological studies, the Adult Temperament Questionnaire (ATQ) by Rothbart <b>measures</b> <b>self-regulatory</b> processes {{in addition to}} constitutionally based individual reactivity. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to validate a German version of the short form of the ATQ with 77 items. 213 psychosomatic inpatients and outpatients and 116 control subjects took part in this study. The study included standardized measures of personality and symptoms. The German version reliably measures the four dimensions negative affect, extraversion, orienting sensitivity and effortful control; subscales were moderately correlated. We found a consistent pattern of correlation to personality (NEO-FFI) and interpersonal problems (IIP), negative affect strongly correlated with neuroticism; effortful control correlated with conscientiousness, orienting sensitivity with openness, and extraversion correlated with the corresponding scale of the NEO-FFI. According to our hypothesis, negative affect was positively correlated with higher distress and physical complaints, while effortful control was negatively correlated with them. When negative affect and effortful control were combined, effortful control had a moderating effect on distress. Clinical and non-clinical samples differed significantly on all dimensions; the ATQ appears to be suitable for differentiating subgroups of patients according to self-regulation...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{negative}} effects on Internet consumers, the divulgence of personal {{information to the public}} has been reported {{as one of the most}} serious infringements on consumer rights. Both consumers and sellers around the world have sought to come up with an optimal solution for information privacy. Several incompatible characteristics of regulating consumer privacy in e-commerce between the U. S. and Korea were explored, and curative suggestions were made to establish a new legal framework to protect online consumer privacy. First, Korea’s regulations for protecting online consumer privacy were found to be centrally controlled, while the U. S. authorities have encouraged self-regulation. Considering the long run efficiency of self-regulation, the Korean authorities should seek more <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> and establish consensus among the businesses to voluntarily protect consumer online privacy. Second, U. S. regulations on protection of online consumer privacy are for the most part commercially oriented and controlled by the FTC, whereas in Korea, an administrative department, the Ministry of Information and Communication, regulates online consumer privacy as a primary authority, resulting in lack of specialization in the matters of consumer protection. To improve the efficiency and specialization in regulation of online consumer privacy in Korea, it would be necessary to promulgate a directive specially designed for protecting consumer privacy and delegating the regulatory power to the Korea Consumer Protection Agency established by the Consumer Protection Act. Finally, international arbitration is recommended as the best tool to resolve and prevent the intricacies of international litigation brought against violation of online consumer privacy...|$|E
40|$|The Dodd-Frank Act {{amended the}} Commodity Exchange Act and adopted an {{explicit}} prohibition regarding activity {{commonly known as}} spoofing in commodities markets. This Note argues that the spoofing prohibition is a necessary step towards improved market discipline and price integrity in the relevant commodities markets. It fills an important gap in the CEA in relation to an elusive form of price manipulation activity by providing an explicit statutory authority on which regulators and market operators may rely in policing suspect trading strategies falling under the spoofing umbrella. Congress’ explicit denouncement of spoofing as an illegal act has ramifications not only for traders, but also for brokers and market makers. In the past, when courts have considered the issue of secondary liability of brokers regarding manipulative activity of their customers {{in the context of}} wash sales, they have determined the CEA’s explicit prohibition of wash sales and the relatively easier identification of wash sales activity as important factors that may potentially increase the secondary liability risk of derivatives brokers. Applying the same analogy to spoofing, greater public awareness and the increasing visibility of spoofing activity (resulting from improvements in the monitoring systems of regulators and market operators) will provide strong incentives for market participants to adapt to changing norms. However, areas of concern, such as risk of selective enforcement and inconsistencies among the applicable market rules, will pose challenges in the spoofing prohibition’s implementation. Therefore, regulators must seek cooperation with relevant market operators to encourage structural reform and <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>measures,</b> such as implementation of appropriate structural safeguards into the trading infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|Background: The adverse {{relation}} between dietary {{trans fatty acid}} (TFA) intake and coronary artery disease risk is well established. Many countries in the European Union (EU) and worldwide have implemented different policies to reduce the TFA intake of their populations. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the added value of EU-level action by estimating the cost-effectiveness of 3 possible EU-level policy measures to reduce population dietary TFA intake. This was calculated against a reference situation of not implementing any EU-level policy (i. e., by assuming only national or <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>measures).</b> Design: We developed a mathematical model to compare different policy options at the EU level: 1) to do nothing beyond the current state (reference situation), 2) to impose mandatory TFA labeling of prepackaged foods, 3) to seek voluntary agreements toward further reducing industrially produced TFA (iTFA) content in foods, and 4) to impose a legislative limit for iTFA content in foods. Results: The model indicated that to impose an EU-level legal limit or to make voluntary agreements may, over the course of a lifetime (85 y), avoid the loss of 3. 73 and 2. 19 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), respectively, and save > 51 and 23 billion euros when compared with the reference situation. Implementing mandatory TFA labeling can also avoid the loss of 0. 98 million DALYs, but this option incurs more costs than it saves compared with the reference option. Conclusions: The model indicates that there is added value of an EU-level action, either via a legal limit or through voluntary agreements, with the legal limit option producing the highest additional health benefits. Introducing mandatory TFA labeling for the EU common market may provide some additional health benefits; however, this would likely not be a cost-effective strategy. JRC.

Method: Regulatory performance was assessed at baseline, then at monthly intervals for a period of 4 months using a visual tracking task. Perceived stress, emotional distress, self-efficacy and general regulatory behaviour were assessed by questionnaire. Following a 2 -month control phase, participants entered a 2 -month self-regulation programme designed to increase regulatory strength: a programme of regular physical exercise. Results: Relative to the control phase, participants who exercised showed significant improvement in <b>self-regulatory</b> capacity as <b>measured</b> by an enhanced performance on the visual tracking task following a thought-suppression task. During the regulatory exercise phase, participants also reported significant decreases in perceived stress, emotional distress, smoking, alcohol and caffeine consumption, and an increase in healthy eating, emotional control, maintenance of household chores, attendance to commitments, monitoring of spending and an improvement in study habits. The control phase showed no systematic changes in performance on the visual tracking task across sessions. Reports of perceived stress, emotional distress and regulatory behaviours were also stable across sessions. Conclusions: The uptake and maintenance of an exercise programme over a 2 -month period produced significant improvements in a wide range of regulatory behaviours. Nearly every major personal and social problem has some degree of regulatory failure. The idea that the capacity for self-regulation can be improved is therefore of vast practical importance. 17 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{experience}} of stress {{may contribute to}} increased food consumption and selection of unhealthy food options. Resource depletion theory suggests stress temporarily depletes resources needed to regulate behavior. Depletions of self-control may result in subsequent failure to regulate eating behaviors, which is particularly salient in restrained eaters. Restraint theory posits people high in dietary restraint require significant effort to control eating. Emotional eating theory further suggests palatable foods {{may be used to}} regulate emotional stress reactions. Relaxation exercises to mitigate stress reactions are recommended in eating and weight management programs, but lack quality scientific support. The current study examined the efficacy of a brief relaxation intervention on stress-related eating in a sample of at-risk women. Self-regulatory resources and affect were tested as mechanisms of action. A sample of 139 women high in dietary restraint completed a stress-task and were subsequently randomized to a relaxation intervention or control group. Participants were presented with foods varied on taste and fat content. Affect, subjective relaxation, and <b>self-regulatory</b> resources were <b>measured</b> at baseline, pre-, and post-intervention. Participation in a relaxation intervention resulted in significantly less food consumption (p 3 ̆c. 05), with a trend toward lower consumption of sweet food (p =. 05), compared to controls. Multiple mediator models examining proposed indirect effects of group on eating outcomes were not supported, with the exception of change in subjective relaxation as a significant indirect effect for high-fat food consumption. This study is the first to provide experimental evidence of the efficacy of relaxation in mitigating the effects of stress on eating.

Foreign investment dissatisfied with host state legitimate public measures affecting their investment demand FET protection alleging investment protection violation. Foreign investors strong pitching for FET standard protection subordinating every sovereign host state regulatory action is creating friction between the parties. While host state insists non-discriminatory police power inherited in FET regulation for public measures, in contrast, foreign investors demand absolute protection of foreign investment. Emerging and developing host country were early targets of foreign investment. A capital export from developed source state to emerging and developing host state is not anymore unidirectional but bidirectional. The investment from emerging and developing economies to developed countries are in rapid increase. Earlier emerging and developing host country were in voracious attack from established source state foreign investors. These suffering host states were fighting for their sovereign rights to regulate for public protection and interests, however, no to avail. Developed source state supporting implicitly for their investor’s investment protection became a victim of themselves. Rules applied to other became a loop to themselves whom they are now fighting to defend host state administrative rights for the public purpose. The absolute FET has become more fickle {{and in a way}} of balancing stage recognising outstanding and value of regulatory rights in FET. My dissertation explores on the same line that FET protection standard for foreign investors and their investment is reciprocal to host state just and equitable regulatory public measures. Host state non-discriminatory measures are non-compensable and legitimate of sovereign rights when public protection and security demands. This adduces long believed and practiced host state necessary steps of domestic law and order. It is evidence by Modern Model BIT, in arbitration practices and even developed source states opposing absolute FET standard protection. These methods proved that predatory nature of alleging FET violations are not only harming host country but also negativity in foreign investors and their investment.

DMCs are postulated to represent the optimal form of long-term engagement. 	The aims of this thesis were to investigate the DMCs in regard to their theoretical justification and empirical validation. The initial chapters present the argument for why the L 2 motivation field needs a new motivational construct. It is posited that although aspects of DMCs are discussed in many existing theories, mainstream motivational psychology has not previously captured periods of motivational surges people experience in pursuit of valued personal visions. Accordingly, the main queries guiding this research were to examine {{what it was like to}} experience a DMC and what the motivational sources of such motivational drives were. 	Deploying a phenomenological method of data analysis, exploratory qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with a number of students who had experienced, or were experiencing, a DMC, whether individually or as part of a group. In addition to providing empirical validation for the DMC phenomenon, results revealed what conditions led to a DMC, what a DMC-cycle entailed, and how DMCs made use of a salient structure. The findings suggested that developing a facilitative structure immediately upon a DMC launch was key to the longevity of the current in part due to the effect of behavioural routines and their role in ensuring continued engagement and protecting it from competing temptations. 	The findings also implied the central role of positive affect in altering the perception of effort and rendering volitional self-control dispensable. As a result of eudaimonic happiness and a sense of growth, the participants experienced positive affect whereby effort was enjoyed and engagement was sustained until goal attainment. However, what accounted for most of the positive affect was not the pleasure of engagement itself or feelings associated with merely learning a second language. Rather, happiness was due to the sense that one was going through a transformational process in which one’s image and identity, level of operation and skills, as well as one’s entire personal entity was being developed. This somewhat indirect link between personal growth and happiness through L 2 learning was seen as a new, promising, but challenging area of research. The results also revealed that DMCs could be experienced by groups of learners and at various levels and timescales when combined energy was directed at a shared goal. Furthermore, it was argued that group DMCs were the ultimate form of group performance in large part due to their potential immunity from social loafing which prevents groups from functioning at their highest capacity. 	In summary, empirical evidence presented in this thesis suggested that long-term motivational momentum in DMCs was the outcome of optimal aggregation of motivational properties that jointly enabled individuals and groups to operate at their highest levels and achieve outstanding results in a fast-track pathway towards goal attainment. While in a DMC, due to the impact of positive affect and a functioning structure, renewable motivational energy is utilised, which empowers long-term and self-propelled engagement without the need for volitional <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>measures.</b> Once applied in L 2 settings, DMCs are argued to provide an exceptionally powerful boost to language learners’ motivation and performance...|$|E
40|$|Liability {{of online}} {{operators}} for user-generated content is a topical issue in Europe. The case of Delfi AS v. Estonia, {{which is currently}} pending before the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights, {{is one example of}} a situation where questions related to this issue are analysed. The First Section judgment finding the online news portal operator, Delfi, liable for defamatory user-generated comments was widely criticized. Moreover, other topical issue in Europe regards dissemination of cyber hate. This thesis combines these two elements and seeks to answer the following question: Which online entities, if any of them, are liable for the dissemination of user-generated cyber hate? The analysis is limited to the approach of the Council of Europe, although the rules and principles adopted in the United States are referred to due to their trendsetter status. Freedom of expression is protected by Article 10 of the European Human Rights Convention. According to the rules and principles adopted in the framework of the Council, this Article does not protect ‘hate speech’ or its online version ‘cyber hate’. However, there exists no clear definition of ‘hate speech’. In the strategies adopted by different Council bodies and in the case-law of the Court, several categories of speech have been considered as ‘hate speech’. However, this practice has been neither clear nor consistent. This is especially regrettable noting that, according to the Court’s case-law, ‘hate speech’ can be categorically excluded from the protection of Article 10 by using the probation of the abuse of rights clause provided for in Article 17 of the Convention. In the course of this research, I come to oppose said the application of said Article due to the unnecessary risks it poses on the enjoyment of freedom of expression. Moreover, I strongly endorse the adoption of a legally binding definition of the central notion. Concerning liability issues, in the case-law of the Court, the media has been afforded special protection under Article 10. On the other hand, this protection is coupled with responsibilities. Therefore, professional journalists have been held liable even for dissemination of third-party content. The central elements analysed by the Court when imposing such liability in printed media cases have been the amount of editorial control and the intent of the journalist. Due to their functions, some online operators have been assimilated to these traditional media actors. They are considered content providers. However, so-called Internet service providers are a category of online operators regarded as intermediary or auxiliary entities. These entities enjoy a limited liability regime. Again, the key in making this distinction between content providers and ISPs is the amount of editorial control over the content the respective entity hosts, transmits or allows to access. Extensive control over information is coupled with wider liability. In the case of Delfi, the First Section of the Court concluded that due to the amount of control practiced by Delfi, it was to be regarded as a content provider. I agree with the main parts of the Court’s analysis. Furthermore, the liability related principles adopted by the Court in this case can be applied in relation to ‘cyber hate’ cases, although the criminal nature of these cases allows the primary liability to be imposed also on the actual authors of the content. I consider that in order for the Council’s fight against ‘hate speech’ to be effective, additional liability should be imposed on content providers and, in specific circumstances, even on ISPs. I endorse the mobilization of and co-operation with the relevant private sector actors to form guidelines on <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> they could apply in order to comply with their duties. Accordingly, the suggested answer to the question posed in the beginning of this research is that all online operators can be liable for user-generated ‘cyber hate’ in case they neglect their respective responsibilities. In the future, the aim of the Council should be to try to hinder any attempts by these entities to rely on the so-called wilful blindness. However, any liabilities imposed must be assessed on case-by-cases basis, taking the circumstances of the specific cases into account, and respecting the inherent principles of Article 10 of the Convention...|$|E
40|$|Background: Young {{women are}} at high risk of weight gain yet few studies have {{examined}} the long-term effectiveness of weight loss programs in this group. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a self-directed internet-based lifestyle program on body weight in young women. Methods: Overweight or obese young women (BMI 33. 4 ± 0. 3 kg/m 2, age 27. 8 ± 0. 3 years) were initially randomized to General lifestyle advice (G) or Structured lifestyle advice (S) via in-person and website support for 12 weeks (Phase I). After Phase I, all participants were supported through a self-directed internet-based program for 36 weeks (Phase II). The internet-based program included a structured hypocaloric diet, physical activity program, self-monitoring tools, peer group forum and monthly emails. Body weight, energy intake and physical activity were measured at week 0, week 12, week 24 and week 48. Adherence to <b>self-regulatory</b> behaviors was <b>measured</b> at week 48. Mixed model analyses were conducted to determine changes in body weight, energy intake and physical activity. Results: A total of 203 overweight or obese young women commenced Phase I and 130 commenced Phase II. In Phase I, S group had significantly greater weight loss than G group (4. 2 ± 0. 6 kg vs 0. 6 ± 0. 3 kg, P 0. 05). Forty-one percent (53 / 130) of the participants who commenced Phase II completed the internet-based intervention. Dropouts had a higher baseline BMI, {{were more likely to be}} married or in a de facto relationship, and more likely to have at least one child. Conclusions: A self-directed internet-based program could be effective in providing support in maintaining weight loss on a structured lifestyle program in young women over 36 weeks. Further research is required to maintain engagement in young women who were married/in a de facto relationship or have children...|$|R
40|$|Structured {{physical}} activity (SPA) is {{one type of}} {{physical activity}} in which preschool aged children participate (e. g., soccer programs). Given that SPA often occurs at community-based locations, such as at a field or hockey rink, primary caregivers, who are often times mothers, must transport their preschool aged children to the scheduled SPA. Although studies have examined social cognitions important to individuals’ participation in their own scheduled physical activity, no study to date {{has focused on the}} social cognitions of mothers’ that {{may be related to the}} transportation of their preschool aged children to SPA. The purpose of this two-study dissertation was to use self-efficacy theory to develop and examine the reliability and validity evidence of measures to assess mothers’ social cognitions (i. e., self-regulatory efficacy to overcome barriers and to schedule/plan; outcome expectations including likelihood and value) that may be related to transporting their children to SPA. A literature review, focus group elicitation with nine participants (Mean age = 35. 25 years; SD = 3. 57), and feedback from three expert judges and 10 participants were used to develop items for each of the measures in Study 1. The reliability of the measures was then investigated in Study 1 using data from 31 participants (Mean age= 33. 50 years; SD = 5. 79) to examine initial internal consistency and then 64 participants (Mean age= 32. 87 years; SD = 4. 48) to further examine internal consistency and temporal stability. Findings revealed some evidence for the content and construct validity, internal consistency, and temporal stability of the measures. To continue the construct validation of the measures, it was important to continue to examine the reliability evidence of the measures and other aspects of validity, including concurrent and predictive validity. In Study 2, data from 93 participants (Mean age= 34. 88 years; SD = 5. 04) were used to examine evidence of the criterion-related validity (i. e., concurrent and predictive) of the developed measures. Results revealed convergence of the measures that assessed similar constructs (i. e., self-regulatory efficacy to schedule/plan and to overcome barriers; outcome expectations: likelihood and value). However, evidence of the divergence of the <b>self-regulatory</b> efficacy <b>measures</b> from the outcome expectation measures was less consistent. Results also revealed that the self-regulatory efficacy beliefs and outcome expectations measures were not significant, independent predictors of transportation to SPA. These predictive validity findings as well as the divergence findings may have been due to the type of mothers who participated in the study (i. e., highly experienced in transporting children to SPA). Findings from the present series of studies suggest a need for continued exploration of the measures, including research with a more diverse sample. Collecting further reliability and validity evidence of these measures to compare it with the evidence from the present studies would contribute to the ongoing construct validation of these measures...|$|R

Chronic multisymptom illnesses such as fibromyalgia and {{chronic fatigue syndrome}} are accompanied by numerous challenges, and have recently been associated with self-regulatory fatigue (SRF). Chronic multisymptom illnesses are also frequently associated with physical fatigue, and through development of a scale measuring SRF, the current study aimed to examine how SRF can be distinguished from physical fatigue. The study also sought to distinguish SRF from self-control. Methods: Two self-regulation researchers developed 30 items related to self-regulatory capacity. These items were distributed to patients (n = 296) diagnosed with chronic multisymptom illness together with validated measures of physical fatigue and self-control. A principal factor analysis {{was employed to examine}} factor structures, identify inter-item relationships, and aid in scale development. Results: The final proposed scale consisted of 18 items <b>measuring</b> <b>self-regulatory</b> capacity (SRF- 18) with cognitive, emotional, and behavioral SRF components. Internal consistency and reliability was acceptable (Cronbach&# 39;s &alpha; = 0. 81). The final scale was moderately correlated with self-control (r = &minus; 0. 48) and highly correlated with physical fatigue (r = 0. 75), although more so with emotional (r = 0. 72) and mental (r = 0. 65) than physical (r = 0. 46) fatigue components. Conclusion: The current study suggests a new scale for measurement of SRF in chronic multisymptom illness. Although cross-validation studies are necessary, such a scale may contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the concept of self-regulation and the role of SRF in chronic illness. Although related to physical fatigue and self-control, the results point to SRF as a distinct construct.
