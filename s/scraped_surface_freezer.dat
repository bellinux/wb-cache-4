50|$|The modern {{design of}} {{industrial}} ice cream freezers ensures {{a high level}} of machine/operator interface and top quality of the produced ice cream.The manufacturing process of ice cream production includes pasteurization, homogenization and maturation of the ice cream mixture. The prepared mixture enters into the industrial double tube scraped crystallizer - heat exchanger, in which the processes of pre-freezing and churning of ice cream are carried out. A refrigerant fluid evaporates and continually circulates in a vessel jacket.Usually, the initial temperature of an ice cream mixture is 12-18 °C. After switching on a freezer, an evaporating temperature of a refrigerant decreases down to a range from −25 to −32 °C. The final temperature of the treated mixture into the <b>scraped</b> <b>surface</b> <b>freezer</b> is about −5 °C, with an ice concentration of approximately 30-50%, depending on the formula. During the freezing process ice crystals form on the inside cool surface of the crystallizer wall. They are removed by blades, mixed into the bulk, and continue to decrease its temperature and to improve heat transfer within the product.|$|E
40|$|Ice {{crystallisation}} in a <b>scraped</b> <b>surface</b> <b>freezer</b> {{is exceedingly}} complex {{and there is}} very limited fundamental understanding of the influences of fluid flow and heat transfer on ice crystal size, number and shape. This paper presents a computer modelling study that combines population balance method and computational fluid dynamics method. Ice crystal nucleation and growth kinetics {{has been described by}} discrete population balance equation. Algorithms for solving the coupled equations of fluid flow, heat transfer and discrete population balance of ice crystallisation have been developed and implemented into a commercial code. Demonstrated is a 2 -D computer simulation of ice crystallisation in a <b>scraped</b> <b>surface</b> <b>freezer.</b> Although the simulation makes several assumptions including simplified fluid flow conditions, the predicted ice crystal size distribution is comparable to the experimental data. It is shown that with combined computational fluid dynamics and population balance modelling much insight into the interaction of fluid flow, heat transfer and ice crystallisation in the <b>scraped</b> <b>surface</b> <b>freezer</b> can be obtained. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It reduces investment costs {{and it can be}} operated with high heat transfer rates and at less power consumption compared with traditional heat exchangers of super-cooling type of shell and tube design, and of <b>scraped</b> <b>surface</b> type, which are commonly used up to now. The different ice slurry generation methods were reviewed. A super-cooling ice slurry generator type was experimentally tested and compared with a traditional <b>scraped</b> <b>surface</b> type. Some interesting advantages were observed in case of super-cooling type, developed in this paper. The stable operating range was slightly smaller compared with the traditional <b>scraped</b> <b>surface</b> type, and heat transfer coefficients were somewhat smaller due to smaller amount of generated ice fraction as common super-cooling type. It is supposed that higher velocity of the super-cooled water jets than reported will lead to increase the produced ice concentration...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deal with}} the overall heat {{transfer}} process and confrontation of experimental measurements and their numerical solutions on simplified model, inside the horizontal <b>scraped</b> <b>surface</b> heat exchanger. The experimental measurements were done on two horizontal <b>scraped</b> <b>surface</b> heat exchangers connected in series. As a product was thermally treated water, heated by vapor {{in the first stage}} and cooled by cold water in the second stage. Applied mass flow of the product: m= 250, 500, 750, 1000 kgh − 1 and rotary velocity of the shaft, scraper blades: rpm= 20, 30, (45), 60, 90 min − 1. For numerical analyses the simplified model was used, with taking only the area between the heat transfer tube, and the shaft with an aim to compare the result to experimental measurements and validate the obtained overall heat exchange, as justify the simplification. As a results from experimental measurements were obtained the correlations for Nusselt number in a form of Nu=f(Re,Pr,η f /η w). Based on the confrontation of results, it can be stated that the level of simplification used at numerical solutions, gives still an acceptable accuracy of overall heat transfer values. From numerical simulations were obtained further results as the velocity, temperature fields, which were used to make certain adaptation on proposed construction and their examination by additional numerical simulations. All these acquired results lead to better understanding the overall process inside the horizontal <b>scraped</b> <b>surface</b> heat exchangers and the proposed construction of mutators can increase the efficiency of heat transfer process for many products in a real processing...|$|R

A <b>scraped</b> <b>surface</b> heat exchanger was used to control crystallisation and to produce fat crystal networks. Experiments were conducted to study {{the effects of}} formulation (solid fat composition) and processing conditions (<b>scraped</b> <b>surface</b> heat exchanger's mixing speed, coolant temperature, and throughput). Rheological studies were conducted to characterise the material properties of the fat systems. Viscosity measurements were carried out to {{study the effects of}} processing conditions on the material behaviour whilst oscillatory rheology was used to study the viscoelastic behaviour of the fat systems. Amplitude sweeps and oscillation tests (small scale rheological analysis) were conducted to study the viscous modulus (G”) and the elastic modulus (G') of the system which is an indicator of the macroscopic consistency of the network. Polarised light microscopy (PLM) was employed to observe the microstructure of the crystallised system. These images were used alongside image analysis software, ImageJ, to quantify the complexity of the microstructural level of the fat crystal networks by calculating their box-counting fractal dimensions (D_b).

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study of}} fluid mechanics and heat transfer in a <b>scraped</b> <b>surface</b> heat exchanger with non-Newtonian power law fluids is undertaken. Numerical results are generated for 2 D steady-state conditions using finite element methods. The effect of blade design and material properties, {{and especially the}} independent effects of shear thinning and heat thinning on the flow and heat transfer, are studied. The {{results show that the}} gaps {{at the root of the}} blades, where the blades are connected to the inner cylinder, remove the stagnation points, reduce the net force on the blades and shift the location of the central stagnation point. The shear thinning property of the fluid reduces the local viscous dissipation close to the singularity corners, i. e. near the tip of the blades, and as a result the local fluid temperature is regulated. The heat thinning effect is greatest for Newtonian fluids where the viscous dissipation and the local temperature are highest at the tip of the blades. Where comparison is possible, very good agreement is found between the numerical results and the available data. Aspects of <b>scraped</b> <b>surface</b> heat exchanger design are assessed in the light of the results. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Pressure-shift {{nucleation}} (PSN) {{has been}} evaluated {{as a potential}} substitute of the crystallization step at the <b>scraped</b> <b>surface</b> heat exchanger in conventional freeze concentration. To do that, PSN experiments were carried out at different pressure and temperature conditions in orange juices of several concentrations. After crystallization, the final concentration reached and {{the size and shape}} of the ice crystals formed were measured. The results obtained showed that the higher the pressure and the lower the temperature employed in the PSN experiments, the higher is the final concentration in the juice and the smaller the ice crystals formed. Four important advantages of pressure-shift nucleation over conventional crystallization were found: temperature in the pressure vessel can be relatively high if pressure is increased enough, the desired concentration can be achieved in the whole sample quasi-instantaneously just after expansion, ice crystals produced are round in shape without pockets and indentations and they are homogeneously distributed throughout the sample. Industrial relevance: Freeze concentration is the most advantageous technique to obtain high quality food concentrates without appreciable loss in taste, aroma, color, or nutritive value. However, it is hardly employed in the food industry mainly due to economic aspects of the technology. In the last decades, many efforts have been made to improve the crystallization phase, the most expensive step in freeze concentration, without definitive success. The results obtained in this paper show that pressure-shift nucleation presents a number of advantages over the traditional crystallization step at the <b>scraped</b> <b>surface</b> heat exchanger which can be exploited to improve the industrial freeze concentration process. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
