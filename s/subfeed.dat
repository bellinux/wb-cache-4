5000|$|... #Subtitle level 3: As a Polish <b>subfeed</b> of VH1 Europe (February 1, 2017-present) ...|$|E
50|$|In October 2013, a Russian <b>subfeed</b> {{was also}} {{added to the}} channel, thus making it now {{broadcast}} in five languages; Hungarian, Romanian, Polish, English and Russian. In January 2014, the Cartoonito brand name was gone from the both CEE and EMEA channels, thus making those shows identifiable as Boomerang shows and the Boomerang next bumpers were rebranded. Starting from July 2014, Russia banned commercials, making the Russian <b>subfeed</b> ad-free on all platforms.|$|E
50|$|The Carolinas {{would not}} have a {{dedicated}} regional sports network focused on the region until 2008, when Fox Sports South created Fox Sports Carolinas as a regional <b>subfeed.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Some Fox Sports {{affiliates}} maintain <b>subfeeds</b> {{to eliminate}} scheduling conflicts when two teams {{that the individual}} network has rights to are playing at the same time, in order to air both games at once. Fox Sports affiliates that operate these alternate feeds are: ...|$|R
2500|$|... Local Now {{programs}} 226 individual feeds covering 207 of the 210 U.S. media {{markets that}} provide local news, weather and traffic content tailored to those communities (the St. Joseph, Missouri, Presque Isle, Maine and Zanesville, Ohio {{are served by}} the Kansas City, Bangor and Columbus area feeds by default), with 15 of them operating as <b>subfeeds</b> offering hyperlocal content to individual regions of the New York City, Atlanta, Denver and Dallas markets. Most markets are served by a single local feed, though Local Now plans to eventually launch additional <b>subfeeds</b> for most markets to [...] "deliver {{a greater degree of}} [...] local relevance" [...] than can be incorporated within a local television newscast due to the market's geographical size and time constraints.|$|R
50|$|Spectrum News Central New York {{serves the}} central {{portions}} of upstate New York. Headquartered in Syracuse, it also operates <b>subfeeds</b> for the Southern Tier and the North Country {{regions of the}} state, encompassing the western and northern Adirondacks. The channel launched in November 2003 as News 10 Now. In February 2007, the channel launched a separate feed focused on Binghamton, Elmira, Corning and surrounding areas.|$|R
5000|$|Currently, {{only one}} AT&T SportsNet {{affiliate}} maintains a <b>subfeed</b> to eliminate scheduling conflicts when two teams {{that the individual}} network has rights to are playing at the same time, in order to air both games at once: ...|$|E
50|$|The network {{maintains}} production {{studios and}} offices located in downtown Minneapolis, which are shared with production and office operations of Fox Sports Wisconsin, which formerly {{served as a}} <b>subfeed</b> of Fox Sports North until it was spun off into a separate channel in 2006.|$|E
50|$|Some {{affiliates}} once operated {{merely as}} subfeeds, but have since become full-fledged regional channels {{in their own}} right. Fox Sports Kansas City and Fox Sports Indiana were once subfeeds of Fox Sports Midwest, and Fox Sports Wisconsin once operated as a <b>subfeed</b> of Fox Sports North.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the effects of}} fasting, <b>subfeeding,</b> and refeeding on plasma biochemistry was carried out on 22 captive yellow-legged gulls Larus cachinnans Pallas. These birds showed the same fasting endurance model described in other species, but with an important decrease in glucose plasma concentration and very great differences between individuals when reaching the deterioration limit, suggesting a moderate physiological adaptation to long periods of fasting. A different model was proposed in subfed gulls in relation to fasted gulls, based on lipid and protein use, which could be reflected by changes in nitrogen wastes and triglyceride levels in this experiment. Thus, the subfed gulls might use protein directly from the diet as an energy source, thereby reducing the use of fat stores. The gulls quickly recovered body mass during the refeeding period, but while some plasma substances quickly reached their initial values, others showed many changes {{before the end of the}} experiment, which could reflect a process of metabolic restabilization. These results contribute to a better knowledge of fasting, <b>subfeeding,</b> and refeeding processes in birds and can be added to a recent study about fasting in gulls. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
5000|$|Some Fox Sports {{affiliates}} have alternate (or overflow) feeds for {{the same}} purpose, named after the host network with [...] "Plus" [...] as a suffix (for example, Fox Sports Detroit Plus). In most cases, <b>subfeeds</b> and alternate feeds are only used during live game telecasts, and are replaced with the main feed's programming {{the rest of the}} time; however, these alternate feeds may provide sports-related programming (such as analysis programs that are not aired as a pre-game or post-game show) which may be exclusive to that feed.|$|R
40|$|The T-cell-mediated immune {{response}} (CMI) of birds, measured with the phytohaemagglutinin skin test, is {{in most cases}} positively correlated with their body mass. This correlation, however, does not imply causality, since high-quality birds may be more immunocompetent as well as heavier {{at the time of}} sampling. We assessed this relationship experimentally by measuring the changes in body mass and CMI in individual captive yellow-legged gulls (Larus cachinnans) maintained with food provided ad libitum (control group), with no food (fasting group), or with one-third of their daily food requirements (<b>subfeeding</b> group). We identified a direct, nonlinear relationship between food intake, body mass, and CMI. Before the experiment started, body mass of birds (corrected for size) fed ad libitum did not correlate with their CMI, while a positive correlation was found after food restriction. This suggests that birds may reach a threshold above which increases in food intake and body mass do not enhance. CMI. Thereafter, food restriction caused decreases in CMl that were significantly correlated with the percentage of body mass lost by each bird, However, for birds that lost similar proportions of body mass, changes in CMI varied according to food-restriction treatment, the <b>subfeeding</b> group exhibiting a stronger CMI than the fasting group.

50|$|On December 16, 2013, {{the channel}} rebranded as Time Warner Cable News Capital Region {{as part of}} a {{branding}} standardization across the provider's news channels that included the introduction of a new graphics and music package. The channel's Hudson Valley <b>subfeed</b> was accordingly rebranded from YNN Hudson Valley to Time Warner Cable News Hudson Valley.|$|E
5000|$|Spectrum News Capital Region {{primarily}} {{serves the}} Capital District region of upstate New York, and maintains a <b>subfeed</b> for the Hudson Valley region. The channel launched on October 11, 2002 as Capital News 9 (launching {{nearly a year}} behind schedule due to various infrastructure and staffing delays). In August 2006, Capital News 9 expanded its reach to systems within eastern New York that Time Warner Cable had recently acquired from Adelphia Communications. In March 2010, {{as part of a}} rebranding of Time Warner Cable's regional news channels statewide, Capital News 9 adopted the [...] "YNN" [...] brand, rebranding as YNN Capital Region. The channel adopted its current name, Time Warner Cable News Capital Region, on December 16, 2013; its <b>subfeed,</b> YNN Hudson Valley, accordingly rebranded as Time Warner Cable News Hudson Valley on that date. It then changed its name to Spectrum News Capital region/Hudson Valley on September 20, 2016.|$|E
50|$|On April 4, 2007, FSN North {{spun off}} its Wisconsin <b>subfeed</b> into FSN Wisconsin (now Fox Sports Wisconsin), a {{separate}} channel carrying Milwaukee Brewers and Milwaukee Bucks games {{as well as}} other events sourced from its former parent channel. In 2009, FSN North rebranded as Fox Sports North as part of a network-wide rebranding of the Fox Sports regional networks.|$|E
5000|$|The channel {{operates}} on a news [...] "wheel" [...] format, offering recorded blocks {{of news and}} weather segments, and feature reports. On weekday mornings and afternoons, the channel also provides traffic reports; sports segments are also provided on a nightly basis. Producers update the wheel throughout the day, inserting new material as stories are filed and updated information becomes available. In addition to running regular weather segments every 10 minutes [...] "on the 1's", the channel also provides wall-to-wall severe weather coverage whenever tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings are in effect for any part of viewing area of Spectrum News Austin or its <b>subfeeds.</b>|$|R
50|$|From October 1, 2012 onwards, {{there are}} local Swedish {{commercials}} on the Swedish <b>subfeed's</b> ad breaks {{as opposed to}} the pan-Nordic commercials aired in Denmark, Norway, Finland and Iceland. Since November 1, 2013, Cartoon Network has been broadcasting in widescreen. Although the channel airs 24/7, some distributors only broadcast the channel between 6:00 AM and 9:00 PM, with Turner Classic Movies filling the remainder of the schedule. Distributors that only broadcast the partial version include Viasat, Telia Digital-tv and many smaller analogue cable systems. The channel is not yet available in Finnish in Finland, but some of the programs on the channel are available in Finnish on local Finnish channels such as MTV3, C More Juniori, Sub and Nelonen.|$|R
50|$|From then {{on until}} 2007, Wisconsin was served {{by one of}} three {{regional}} <b>subfeeds</b> of MSC/FSN North; the other two being a feed for the Twin Cities metropolitan area and a feed {{for the rest of}} Minnesota (as well as Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota). CBS sold the network to News Corporation in 2000, ultimately rebranding as FSN North in April 2001. Despite being well out of the station's market area, MSC's late night encore of WCCO's 10:00 p.m. newscast also aired on the Wisconsin network until the Fox purchase. The network then began maintaining offices at the studios of Fox owned-and-operated station WITI (channel 6, now an affiliate of the network) in the Milwaukee suburb of Brown Deer, along with sharing limited programming with that station.|$|R
50|$|On January 8, 2016, Sinclair {{announced}} that American Sports Network would launch as a dedicated, digital multicast network under the American Sports Network name with 10 stations including WPNT on January 11, 2016. However, the station continues to air Duquesne Dukes men's and women's basketball, Penn State Nittany Lions men's ice hockey, {{and the annual}} Arizona Bowl college football game on the main channel {{in addition to the}} ASN <b>subfeed.</b>|$|E
50|$|On June 30, 1997, Fox/Liberty Networks (owned as a {{joint venture}} between News Corporation and Liberty Media) {{purchased}} a 40% interest in Cablevision's sports properties (including the SportsChannel networks, Madison Square Garden, and the New York Knicks and New York Rangers) for $850 million. In January 1998, SportsChannel was integrated into Fox Sports Net, a group of regional sports networks created by Fox/Liberty in November 1996. At that time, SportsChannel Cincinnati was folded into Fox Sports Ohio (the former SportsChannel Ohio), serving as a regional <b>subfeed</b> of that network.|$|E
5000|$|On February 12, 2010, Time Warner Cable {{announced}} that Capital News 9 and News 10 Now would be rebranded as [...] "YNN" [...] (for [...] "Your News Now"), adopting the same brand {{that had already}} been in use on their sister channels in Buffalo and Rochester (the former of which was the first to adopt the [...] "YNN" [...] brand when it launched in March 2009). The rebranding occurred in March 2010. The following month in April 2010, the channel launched a <b>subfeed</b> for the Hudson Valley region, YNN Hudson Valley.|$|E
50|$|The {{separation}} of broadcast zones for the channel is mostly {{due to the}} defined broadcast territories set by the National Basketball Association for four of the region's five NBA franchises - the Dallas Mavericks, Oklahoma City Thunder, San Antonio Spurs and New Orleans Pelicans (the Houston Rockets are carried on Root Sports Southwest). In {{the event of a}} scheduling conflict between either of the teams (such as Mavericks/Thunder, Mavericks/Spurs, Thunder/Spurs, and sometimes Mavericks/Spurs/Thunder), the games will be shown on their own <b>subfeeds</b> (Thunder on Fox Sports Oklahoma, Spurs or Mavericks on Fox Sports Southwest). In certain circumstances, games involving the Dallas Stars (the only National Hockey League team based in Texas) air on Fox Sports Southwest beyond the Dallas-Fort Worth designated market area, including the Houston market, which no longer receives any NBA broadcasts over Fox Sports Southwest. This is also true with the San Antonio Stars, the only WNBA team in Texas, many of whose games are shown beyond the San Antonio designated market area.|$|R
5000|$|On December 16, 2013, {{the channel}} rebranded as Time Warner Cable News North Carolina {{as part of}} a {{branding}} standardization across the provider's news channels that included the introduction of a new graphics and music package. All of the channel's <b>subfeeds</b> around the state were accordingly rebranded as Time Warner Cable News (Raleigh/Charlotte/Triad/Coastal). Prior to the rebrand, the channel was one of only two regional news channels owned by Time Warner Cable (alongside New York City sister network NY1) that did not adopt the [...] "YNN" [...] brand (for [...] "Your News Now"), which was adopted by its other news channels between 2009 and 2011 (including Buffalo, New York sister network Time Warner Cable News Buffalo, which was the first to use the brand when it launched in March 2009 as YNN Buffalo). On May 18, 2016 Time Warner Cable was purchased by Charter Communications; [...] the channel was re-branded Spectrum News North Carolina in March 2017. In May 2017 - Spectrum News was added to existing Charter Spectrum customers on Channel 5 for Carolina Beach and Topsail/Surf City systems and on Channel 11 for Lillington systems.|$|R
5000|$|Each of the Spectrum News {{channels}} utilize {{a half-hour}} news [...] "wheel" [...] format and carry live news programming at least 20 hours a day. NY1 Noticias {{is the only}} channel in this network to broadcast news exactly 24 hours a day (while others get lots of interrupt programs, it only broadcasts weekly political program Pura Politíca). Weather reports are broadcast every 10 minutes [...] "on the 1s" [...] (for example, 7:01 a.m. or 5:31 p.m.); a brief minute-long roundup of the day's major headlines (titled either [...] "Top Stories" [...] or [...] "Your News in a Minute") airs {{at the top and}} bottom of each hour. Each channel also carries live traffic reports based out of their local newsrooms and each maintains its own local assignment desk, on-air staff (anchors, reporters/videojournalists and sports staff), producers and news management. SN's channels in Upstate New York have their weather forecast segments produced out of Spectrum News Central New York's studios in Syracuse, whereas the other channels produce their own weather segments using separate staffs of meteorologists (Spectrum News North Carolina similarly regionalizes its weather coverage, but maintains individual staffs of meteorologists for the Research Triangle, Piedmont Triad and Charlotte areas that appear on the channel's respective <b>subfeeds</b> in each area).|$|R
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 2007, Fox Sports Midwest signed an {{exclusive}} long-term agreement to broadcast games from the Kansas City Royals (this followed the team's decision to dissolve the Royals Sports Television Network, a regional television syndication service for the team's game broadcasts). On January 24, 2008, the network formally {{announced that it would}} spin-off its <b>subfeed</b> for the Kansas City market into a separate channel, Fox Sports Kansas City, to avoid scheduling conflicts with Fox Sports Midwest's St. Louis Cardinals game coverage. The main St. Louis-based feed reverted to the Fox Sports Midwest moniker that same year.|$|E
50|$|Spectrum News Capital Region (formerly Time Warner Cable News Capital Region) is an American {{cable news}} {{television}} channel that {{is owned by}} Charter Communications, as an affiliate of its Spectrum News slate of regional news channels. The channel provides 24-hour rolling news coverage focused primarily on the Capital District of eastern New York. The channel is headquartered in Albany, New York, and maintains a <b>subfeed</b> serving the Hudson Valley region. Spectrum News Capital Region is carried on channel 9 {{throughout most of the}} region, although its channel slot varies in the towns of Queensbury and Canajoharie, and in Berkshire County, Massachusetts.|$|E
5000|$|More or less, it {{operates}} as a regional sports network for Oklahoma's two largest metropolitan areas (although officially, the primary regional sports network for the Oklahoma City and Tulsa television markets is the Fox Sports Oklahoma <b>subfeed</b> of Fox Sports Southwest), but it mostly offers public interest programming. The channel's sports offerings consist mainly of high school sports with football games during the fall season and basketball games during the late winter and early spring months, along with high school swimming events; these games are broadcast under the banner [...] "Oklahoma Ford High School Game of the Week." ...|$|E
5000|$|On February 12, 2010, Time Warner Cable {{announced}} that News 10 Now and Capital News 9 would be rebranded as [...] "YNN" [...] (for [...] "Your News Now") that March, adopting the same brand {{that had already}} been in use on their sister channels in Buffalo and Rochester (the former of which was the first to adopt the [...] "YNN" [...] brand when it launched in March 2009). On December 16, 2013, Time Warner Cable rebranded the channel as Time Warner Cable News Central New York (and its <b>subfeed</b> as Time Warner Cable News Southern Tier) as part of a branding standardization across the provider's news channels. That included the introduction of a new graphics and music package.|$|E
50|$|On October 2, 2008, KSBI {{signed a}} two-year {{agreement}} with the Oklahoma City Thunder NBA franchise (formerly the Seattle SuperSonics until it relocated that year, after the team was unable to obtain government funding for renovations to KeyArena) to broadcast select games starting with the 2008-09 inaugural season in Oklahoma City (with an initial slate of 24 games that season, seventeen {{of which would be}} regular season matches beginning with the October 29 season opener against the Milwaukee Bucks); it shared the television rights with Fox Sports Oklahoma (which launched in September 2008 as a <b>subfeed</b> of regional sports network Fox Sports Southwest, and was slated to carry 65 additional regionally televised games for the 2008-09 season). The KSBI contract also included rights to air half-hour pregame and postgame shows, various team-related programs (including the magazine show Thunder Weekly), and overnight/early morning rebroadcasts of each televised game. The station's broadcast relationship with the Thunder ended on August 3, 2010, after the team signed an exclusive multi-year agreement with Fox Sports Oklahoma starting with the 2010-11 season. On May 10, 2012, KSBI began broadcasting Texas Rangers Major League Baseball games on Friday evenings, produced by KTXA-TV in Dallas-Fort Worth; these games moved to KSBI's 52.2 subchannel in 2013, before being discontinued after the subchannel was decommissioned following the takeover of KSBI's operations by Griffin (the Rangers subsequently signed a 20-year television contract with Fox Sports Southwest, which already simulcast its Rangers telecasts through its Fox Sports Oklahoma <b>subfeed,</b> which gave the regional sports network exclusive rights to Rangers games not aired by ESPN, TBS, Fox or Fox Sports 1).|$|E
50|$|Originally {{operating}} as a <b>subfeed</b> of Fox Sports Rocky Mountain, then Fox Sports Midwest in 1998, the network formally {{announced that it}} would spin-off Fox Sports Kansas City as a separate channel on January 24, 2008 after Fox Sports Midwest signed an exclusive long-term broadcast agreement with the Kansas City Royals. The agreement was struck following the dissolution of the Royals Sports Television Network, a regional network formed in 2003 to broadcast games and analysis programs for the Major League Baseball franchise, which distributed its event telecasts to broadcast and cable affiliates throughout the Midwestern and South Central United States. Specifically, Fox Sports Kansas City was created to avoid scheduling conflicts with coverage of St. Louis Cardinals games televised by Fox Sports Midwest.|$|E
50|$|On March 11, 2014, Time Warner Cable {{announced}} a second attempt {{to launch a}} regional news channel for the San Antonio market by launcing a <b>subfeed,</b> Time Warner Cable News San Antonio. (News 9 San Antonio was the first attempt by TWC in 2003-2004.) It would operate out of TWCN Austin's headquarters and share managerial staff, with reports being filed for cablecast by San Antonio-based mutli-platform reporters in a separate bureau that was established in that city. It was soft-launched on April 8, {{with a series of}} weeknight preview broadcasts of two programs airing on the channel (the political discussion program Capital Tonight and the sports highlight program Sports Night) that began. The feed formally launched on June 2, 2014. Plans call for the future hirings of additional journalists based in San Antonio.|$|E
50|$|DirecTV Sports Networks {{would be}} {{acquired}} by AT&T Inc. in 2015, as {{a byproduct of}} its acquisition of DirecTV. The renamed RSN unit, AT&T Sports Networks, would eventually announce on June 12, 2017, that it would rebrand most of its regional sports networks - {{with the exception of}} Root Sports Northwest, due to its ownership being majority controlled by the Seattle Mariners - under the AT&T SportsNet banner on July 14, 2017. AT&T Sports Networks continues to broadcast various sports magazine and documentary programs and select sporting events broadcast by Fox Sports Networks through an affiliation agreement with its former parent group; with the exception of AT&T SportsNet Southwest, which does not carry these programs due to the presence of a Fox Sports-owned <b>subfeed</b> network in its home market, these channels largely continue to carry the same local teams and national Fox Sports Networks programs as they did under FSN ownership.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{presence}} of ABC affiliate WSYR-TV, which broadcasts on VHF channel 9, it {{is the only one of}} Spectrum's news channels in upstate New York that is not carried on channel 9 in its primary markets; it is instead carried on either channel 10 or channel 14. In March 2010, as part of a rebranding of Time Warner Cable's regional news channels statewide, News 10 Now adopted the [...] "YNN" [...] brand, rebranding as YNN Central New York. The channel adopted its current name, Time Warner Cable News Central New York, on December 16, 2013; its <b>subfeed,</b> YNN Southern Tier and YNN North Country, were accordingly and respectively rebranded as Time Warner Cable News Southern Tier and Time Warner Cable News North Country on that date. It then changed its name to Spectrum News Central New York/Southern Tier/North Country on September 20, 2016.|$|E
5000|$|Fox Sports Ohio {{is unique}} among the {{regional}} Fox Sports Networks as it operates in two full-time 24-hour feeds, one for Cleveland {{and one for}} Cincinnati (some television providers improperly refer to the latter [...] "Fox Sports Cincinnati" [...] to avoid confusion among viewers); the Cincinnati feed formerly operated as a separate channel, SportsChannel Cincinnati, until it was converted into a <b>subfeed</b> of Fox Sports Ohio following Fox's acquisition and integration of the SportsChannel group into FSN in 1998. National programming {{is exactly the same}} on both feeds. However, only the Cincinnati feed carries Reds games, which are prohibited from airing in most of northeast Ohio because of territorial restrictions. Both feeds carry Columbus Blue Jackets and Cleveland Cavaliers broadcasts, although not all air on both because of conflicts. Reds games televised by the Cincinnati feed are also broadcast on Fox Sports Indiana and Fox Sports Tennessee.|$|E
5000|$|On February 1, 2017 (at 6:00AM CET), the {{localised}} Polish feed of VH1 {{has been}} merged operations with VH1 Europe from Camden Town, London, United Kingdom, {{due to the}} programming change and informing viewers on the upper-left corner showing that Rise And Shine With VH1 will be next after the last programme on the localised Polish feed (100% Music). The last music video to be played on the localised Polish feed is Can't Hold Us by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis featuring Ray Dalton at 5:59AM CET. The first music video to be played when the localised Polish feed of VH1 switched its own programming to VH1 Europe's programming is Million Reasons by Lady Gaga. While the playlist and the on-air identity (except for the advertising bumpers) has been largely changed, the on-screen graphics are still intact. Unlike the main feed of VH1 Europe (which is commercial-free), the Polish <b>subfeed</b> has advertisements.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the name}} of Fox Kids, the channel was first {{launched}} in Central and Eastern Europe on 1 April 1999 as an 'Initial Public Offering' channel available at first in English, Romanian and Russian. Its operation offices were located in Bucharest and in Moscow at that time. The channel was expanded to include Turkey with a Turkish audio track in May 2000 and it was first available on digital satellite TV service Digiturk on that same month, and then on cable TV provider Turkish Telecom on July of the same year. On November 2000, Fox Kids Europe expanded its coverage area to the Middle East by launching an English-language dedicated <b>subfeed</b> from the channel for its Arab audience on satellite TV platform Orbit (later Orbit Showtime Network, currently OSN) in countries like Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, among others. Israel was excluded from receiving this feed, due to plans of launching a fully localised channel in Hebrew that eventually were concreted in February 2001.|$|E
