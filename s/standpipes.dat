The Philadelphia Fire Department nozzles allowed 100 psi nozzle pressure while One Meridian Plaza's pressure relief valves were giving less than 60 psi discharge pressure, which was not sufficient to fight the fire. It was several hours into the fire before a technician who could adjust the valves arrived at the scene.|$|E
5|$|The priory was rebuilt around 1200 on {{a larger}} scale with the Romanesque church {{demolished}} to its first course of ashlar. The construction of the new church continued through much of the 13th century. The enlarged priory had twin towers at the west end flanking a large double doorway above which was a central rose window; piped water was provided using lead pipes from the cloister, under the church to buildings or <b>standpipes</b> to the north or west of the priory. The main body of the church comprised a nave with two aisles, transepts and a choir. The aisles were laid with geometric coloured tiles adjoining the sandstone columns of the nave. The north aisle was divided into alcoves or private chapels where a number of people – probably local nobles and gentry – were buried. An unusual feature of the church was a well, sunk into the nave, possibly built in an effort to safeguard its water supplies.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fire}} was going into its sixth hour it had spread up to the 26th floor. With {{inadequate}} water pressure coming from the <b>standpipes,</b> firefighters stretched hoses up the building's stairwells to help fight the fire. While hoses were being taken up to the fire a sprinkler technician arrived to fix the water pressure. This improved the hose streams, but the fire had engulfed several floors {{and could not be}} contained with just hoses. By 7:00 AM, almost eleven hours into the fire, firefighters were able to get control of the fire on the 22nd through 24th floors, but {{the fire was}} still out of control on the 25th and 26th floors and was spreading upwards. Structural damage observed inside the building by firefighters and consultations with a structural engineer led to fears that the damaged floors might collapse. At 7:00 AM an order to evacuate the building was issued by Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer, and the building was completely evacuated by 7:30 AM. After the evacuation, the only fire suppression efforts left were water streams being directed to the building from the neighboring Girard Trust Building and One Centre Square.|$|E

25|$|Women {{preferred}} canal {{water to}} groundwater because canal water was softer {{and was not}} brackish. The surroundings of <b>standpipes</b> were dirty and the residents did not feel responsible to maintain them, seeing this as a responsibility of the government. Shallow wells were contaminated. There was no sewerage and no system to dispose greywater. Household latrines were used primarily by women. Men used sanitary facilities at mosques or defecated in canals. Children defecated openly in the streets or fields. Emptying of latrines was done by donkey carts or trucks which empty their load into canals. As a result of conditions like these infant mortality remained high despite the government's provision of water through <b>standpipes.</b>|$|E

40|$|This master's thesis {{studies the}} {{correlation}} between rapid alterations in cuttings concentration and the corresponding change in pressure loss, using the <b>standpipe</b> pressure as pressure indicator. Drilling data from two wells in the North Sea is used when analysing the pressure effect from cuttings concentration. Intervals {{where there is a}} change in rate of penetration and <b>standpipe</b> pressure simultaneously, while all other relevant parameters are kept constant, are identified. Difference in <b>standpipe</b> pressure and rate of penetration is represented graphically in order to identify trends between the two parameters. A correlation between change in rate of penetration and the response in <b>standpipe</b> pressure was found for all sections. Calculations indicate that the change in pressure loss cannot solely be explained by cuttings bedding, viscosity and density changes or weight of suspended cuttings in the wellbore. Some other effect is therefore likely to be present. Empirical equations from curve fitting were obtained for each section, describing the relation between change in <b>standpipe</b> pressure and change in rate of penetration. The number of cases evaluated is, however, not sufficient for the empirical equations to accurately predict changes in <b>standpipe</b> pressure beyond the evaluated sections. A correlation between the slope of the fitted curves and the properties of each section was not identified...|$|R
25|$|Out of the 32 {{million people}} that {{received}} free basic water in 2005, almost half, or 15 million, were not poor. Furthermore, many poor in rural areas, who receive limited {{amounts of water}} for free through <b>standpipes,</b> do not benefit fully. Those without access to publicly provided water do not benefit at all from the program. The policy is more successful in wealthier municipalities, which {{have the ability to}} cross-subsidise water provision for the poor, than in poorer, often rural municipalities. This {{is one of the reasons}} why in 2009 the government announced it would review its implementation strategy for free basic water, possibly through registers of poor users.|$|E
25|$|In {{fiscal year}} 2006–2007, the NWSC tariff for {{domestic}} use was US$0.64 per cubic metre. Taken {{from a public}} standpipe, the tariff was US$0.42 per cubic metre or less than US$0.01 per jerrycan. The average commercial tariff was US$1.00 per cubic metre. For commercial users, a rising block tariff structure was used. A customer who {{was connected to the}} sewerage system would pay an additional charge of 75-100 percent. Although water is cheapest at <b>standpipes,</b> UN-Water reports that in this case users usually have to pay the costs of operating a stand tap and thus in the end pay more. A cross subsidy arrangement enables NWSC to keep in operation systems that do not cover operation and maintenance costs.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the United Nations' Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation {{estimated}} that only 55% of the Yemeni population {{had access to}} improved water source – including 40% from house connections and 15% from other improved water sources such as <b>standpipes.</b> Only 53% had access to improved sanitation.

25|$|Morocco has a {{complicated}} system {{of water and}} sanitation tariffs and fees that consists of a large array of tariffs {{at different stages of}} the water cycle: water abstraction, sale in bulk, retail sales, as well as the collection, treatment and discharge of wastewater. Urban tariffs are differentiated by locality, by the quantity consumed, and by the type of use (residential, public, commercial and industrial). Urban tariff review mechanisms vary furthermore depending on whether the service provider is private or public, the process for the latter being more complicated and cumbersome than for the former. In general, the level of urban water tariffs is high compared to other countries in the Middle East and North Africa, making it hard to afford to the urban poor connected to the piped network. On the other hand, it is insufficient to allow for full cost recovery. 11% of all users, including a large share of poor users in both urban and rural areas, receive water for free from <b>standpipes.</b>|$|E
25|$|The area {{also saw}} a number of civic improvements. Horse-drawn {{streetcar}} service reached the area in 1875, 13 years after {{the rest of the}} city had achieved service, and electric streetcars arrived in 1895. St. Teresa's Catholic Church was built at 1244 V Street SE in 1879, and Emanuel Episcopal Church (now Delaware Avenue Baptist Church) at 1301 V Street SE was erected in 1891 to replace an 1869 church whose foundation had cracked. The 11th Precinct of the Metropolitan Police Department was established in 1901 to patrol the area, the Ketcham School (now Ketcham Elementary School) was built in 1907, and water and sewage service installed between 1904 and 1920. Nonetheless, water and sewage service in the area remained spotty, and some homes drew water from public <b>standpipes</b> as late as the 1960s. The Commissioners of the District of Columbia changed the street names in Anacostia to conform to those in the city of Washington in 1908. In 1920, local African-American Roman Catholics constructed Our Lady of Perpetual Help church on land formerly owned by physician J.C. Norwood. The Fort Stanton site was purchased by National Capital Park Commission (NCPC) for $56,000 in 1926.|$|E
25|$|Water supply. Slightly {{more than}} half the {{population}} of Tanzania is estimated to have access to an improved water source, with stark differences between urban areas (about 79% in 2010) and rural areas (about 44% in 2010). In rural areas, access is defined as meaning that households have to travel less than one kilometre to a protected drinking water source in the dry season. Trends in access to water supply are difficult to discern due to conflicting and unreliable data. However, it seems that access increased during the 1990s, particularly in rural areas, but stagnated during the 2000s. According to data from the Household Budget Surveys 2000/2001 and 2007 access to an improved water source in mainland Tanzania even decreased from 55% in 2000 to 52% in 2007. Using a narrow definition, in 2007 around 34% of households had access to piped water, as opposed to 40% in 2000. However, using a broader definition of access that also includes <b>standpipes</b> and protected springs, there has been a slight increase in the proportion of households reporting a drinking water source within one kilometre. Estimates from the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) show a different trend. They show a slight decline in access from 55% in 1990 to 53% in 2010. According to these figures, access in rural areas stagnated, while in urban areas it decreased from 94% to 79% over the same period. The JMP estimates rely on extrapolations using, among others, data from the Household Budget Survey 2000/2001 and 2007, the Census of 2002 and the Demographic and Health Surveys of 1999, 2005 and 2010.|$|E
