40|$|A {{total of}} 33 surveys of amenity {{herbicides}} {{took place during}} 1998 – 1999. These surveys con-centrated on two application methods: all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and controlled droplet applicators (CDAs). The purpose of these surveys was to measure surface deposition and potential inhalation exposure of the operators to the <b>spray</b> <b>fluid</b> used. This paper recommends that the following indicative values should inform risk assessments for these types of application. ATV: The potential dermal exposure (PDE) to <b>spray</b> <b>fluid</b> (21 sample sets) ranged between 0. 7 and 6. 8 ml/h of <b>spray</b> <b>fluid,</b> median 2. 0 ml/h based on patch samplers.

40|$|A {{total of}} 20 surveys at IS sites of {{remedial}} in-situ timber and masonry treatment {{took place in}} the latter half of 1996. Two of these surveys concerned wall washes (biocides), the remainder were non-agricultural pesticides. The purpose was to measure the surface deposition and inhalation exposure of the operatives to the pesticide spray fluids used. The diluted spray fluids were found to have significantly different concentrations from those intended by the sprayer. The pesticides were applied at pressures between 320 and 1050 kPa. Deposition rates for <b>spray</b> <b>fluid</b> on coveralls covered a wide range, with more than 30 fold difference between the median and the highest results (median 209 mg/minute; range 27. 4 to 6550 mg/min). Contamination of coveralls occurred in all surveys, with the pesticide getting beneath the coveralls in 95 % of surveys, with a median 5 % contamination beneath the overall. The averaged and normalised deposition pattern was 75 % legs, 11 % arms, 12 % torso and 2 % head. Exposure of hands to pesticide (expressed as <b>spray</b> <b>fluid)</b> beneath protective gloves occurred in 89 % of surveys (median 5. 78 mg / minute; range 0. 23 to 358 mg/min) and contamination of socks by <b>spray</b> <b>fluid</b> in 78 % of surveys (median 2. 08 mg/minute; range 0. 12 to 260 mg/min). Exposure by inhalation to <b>spray</b> <b>fluid</b> was measurable in 72 % of surveys (median 53. 5 mg/m 3 TWA; range 4. 33 to 1320 mg/m 3; 2 data excluded).

40|$|The {{response}} of aerosolized viruses to relative humidity depended greatly on {{the composition of}} the fluid from which the viruses were sprayed. For example, the removal of salts from the <b>spray</b> <b>fluid</b> diminished the loss of infectivity of Langat virus (a group B arbovirus) at intermediate relative humidities. Salts were less toxic towards aerosolized Semliki Forest virus (a group A arbovirus) but did cause some loss of infectivity at higher relative humidities after prolonged storage of the aerosol. Polyhydroxy-compounds reversed the virucidal effects of salts on arboviruses. The removal of protein from the spray suspensions of arboviruses caused rapid loss of infectivity in the aerosol at very high relative humidities but had no detrimental effect at lower relative humidities. Poliovirus and T coliphage, which possess no structural lipid, retained high levels of infectivity following aerosolization at relative humidites of 7 o ~ or above; at lower relative humidities they were inactivated rapidly. This rapid inactivation was increased further at lower solute concentrations of the <b>spray</b> <b>fluid.</b> The infectivities of aerosolized polioviruses and coliphages depended on the mode of rehydration during collection of the aerosols, but the infectivities of arboviruses in aerosols were unaffected by this. Atmospheric oxygen was not toxic to viruses in the aerosol state...|$|E

The experiments were conducted at 250 kPa, 300 kPa, 350 kPa, 400 kPa, 450 kPa, and 500 kPa <b>spray</b> <b>fluid</b> pressures. The University Boom Sprayer Test Bench was employed for conducting lab {{experiments in the}} laboratories of the Department of Farm Machinery & Power and the University Boom Sprayer was employed for field experiments at the Post-graduate Agricultural Research Station experimental fields, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad. The dimensionless ratio of droplet size to nozzle aperture diameter (diD) followed straight line trend up-to Reynold's Number 40, 000, for locally made nozzle (d= 1. 6 mm), up-to 33, 000 for imported yellow nozzle (d= 1. 3 mm), and upto 18, 000 for imported orange nozzle (d= 0. 7 mm).

40|$|The {{survival}} in air {{as a function}} of relative humidity (RH) and aerosol age is reported for Escherichia coli (strains B and Jepp) and for Serratia marcescens (strain U K 8) sprayed from suspensions in distilled water and in solutions of dextran and of raffinose. The {{survival in}} nitrogen (> 99. 9 yo) of E. coli (strains B, Jepp and commune) is given {{as a function of}} RH, when sprayed from suspension in distilled water and in raffinose solution. The results show that E. coli in the aerosol was subject to at least three stresses, an air stress, an RH stress, and a collection stress. The air stress accounted for loss of viability at low RH and the RH stress occured a t high RH and is expressed as RH ranges in which E. coli rapidly lost viability. The survival, especially a t high RH, depended upon the composition of the collecting fluid. At high RH a range of RH was found in which the bacteria were unstable when collected in phosphate buffer. Addition of raffinose (chosen as a typical protecting agent) to the <b>spray</b> <b>fluid</b> and the addition of M-sucrose to the collecting fluid eliminated the instability for E. coli (com-mune) and decreased it for the other two strains...|$|E

40|$|Intranasal drug {{delivery}} {{is an alternative}} method in addition to traditional oral and intravenous doses. Nasal {{drug delivery}} {{has proven to be}} a very effective technique for nicotine cessation (Hjalmarson et al., 1994), the influenza vaccine (Jackson et al. 1999), and drugs that need to be take continuously, such as insulin (Dondeti et al., 1995). Studies have found that for effective fast-acting body response, the drug needs to be deposited in the highly vascularized mucosal tissue lining the bony turbinates in the nasal cavity. Commercial nasal sprays are continuously optimizing parameters to develop the most effective deposition patterns. In this project, drug deposition is modeled using a simplified 2 D depiction of the nasal passageway with uniformly-shaped, spherical spray particles. This problem is implemented in COMSOL by using 2 D Navier Stokes fluid flow equations to model the airflow through the nose, and the Particle Tracing module to model the spray trajectory and deposition. The model output was validated by determining the percentages of particles in each region of the nasal passage - anterior, turbinate, posterior, and outlet - and comparing with published experimental data by Cheng et al (2001). A sensitivity analysis was done on the following parameters: particle density, particle size, nozzle spray angle, and nozzle penetration depth. It was found that this model was sensitive to only penetration depth. As penetration depth through the nostril increased, there was a decrease in the particle deposition in the anterior region of the nasal cavity and an increase in the percentage of particles that exited through the outlet. Deposition in the middle and posterior regions was not affected by variation in penetration depth. Our sensitivity analysis demonstrated that variations in spray angle, particle size, and density of the nasal <b>spray</b> <b>fluid</b> do not significantly affect deposition pattern. Therefore, when designing nasal sprays, as long as these parameters remain within the specified ranges, consistent deposition patterns will be achieved. This result also allows for further research on creating sprays that are more concentrated and have encapsulated drugs...|$|E
