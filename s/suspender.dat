25|$|Two {{versions}} of <b>suspender</b> were also produced. The first medals, including the dated ones, had a straight <b>suspender</b> that was {{wide enough to}} accept the 38 millimetres (1½ inches) wide ribbon. The <b>suspender</b> was changed to a narrower width in 1875, to accept a new 32 millimetres (1¼ inches) wide ribbon. Both types of <b>suspender</b> were swiveling and were affixed to the medal {{by means of a}} double-toe claw and a horizontal pin through the upper edge of the medal.|$|E
25|$|As {{a bundle}} is laid down, it was {{initially}} supported by supports {{mounted on the}} catwalk, then both ends were attached and the cable is tensioned at the eastern anchor points. As with a conventional cable suspension span, all of the tensioned bundles were then compressed into a circular shape and protected with a circular wrap of wire. Saddles for <b>suspender</b> cables were added and <b>suspender</b> cables placed and tensioned. The <b>suspender</b> cable tensioning lifted the span from its supporting falsework.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 2011, {{proper balance}} between main cable runs and <b>suspender</b> cables and proper tension {{were applied to}} the main and <b>suspender</b> cables. On November 20, 2012, this process was {{completed}} which made the SAS portion of the bridge self-supporting. After that, the falsework was removed.|$|E
50|$|Ice {{hockey players}} use <b>suspenders</b> for holding up hockey socks. As these socks are {{essentially}} woollen tubes, {{they need to}} be kept from rolling onto ankles. The socks can be held up by either hockey tape or hockey <b>suspenders,</b> which function like stocking <b>suspenders.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There {{have been}} several {{precursors}} to <b>suspenders</b> throughout the past 300 years, but modern <b>suspenders</b> were first invented in 1820 by Albert Thurston. They were once almost universally worn, due to the high cut of mid-nineteenth and early twentieth century trousers that made a belt impractical. During the nineteenth century, <b>suspenders</b> were sometimes called galluses. [...] Samuel Clemens, known for his work as the author Mark Twain, patented [...] "Adjustable and Detachable Straps for Garments" [...] (ADSG), {{becoming one of the}} first to receive a United States patent for <b>suspenders</b> in 1871. After losing popularity during World War I, when men became accustomed to uniform belts, <b>suspenders</b> were still regular attire throughout the 1920s. Because of their image as 'underwear', some men switched to belts during the 1930s as the vests which had hidden <b>suspenders</b> became worn less often. This also signaled the switch in position of securing buttons from the outside of the waistband to the inside. Life magazine stated in 1938 that 60% of American men chose belts over <b>suspenders.</b> Though the return of fuller-cut trousers in the 1940s revived <b>suspenders,</b> they did not dominate over belts again to the same extent. However, in the UK they remained the norm to wear with suits and dress trousers.|$|R

25|$|The {{design on}} the reverse has {{remained}} virtually unaltered through all versions of the medal. Generally speaking, the two early Queen Victoria versions with a wide <b>suspender</b> had a slightly different reverse with a larger flag at the masthead of the ship, while the later narrow <b>suspender</b> and subsequent versions had a more triangular flag.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2000s, it {{has become}} fashionable for some younger women to wear <b>suspenders,</b> a style that emerged from Mod styles in the late 1960s through to punk rock and skinhead styles of the late 1970s into the 1980s. One {{particular}} exponent of this fashion was Eurythmics vocalist Annie Lennox, whose fashion styling was akin to cross-dressing as a male character, with her dark suit and red <b>suspenders.</b> Unisex fashion featured not only women wearing trousers and <b>suspenders,</b> but men in skirts with <b>suspenders</b> as an accessory [...]|$|R

5000|$|Narrow, clip-on style <b>suspenders</b> {{are also}} a typical part of skinhead, {{and to a lesser}} extent, punk fashion. In skinhead and punk fashion, <b>suspenders</b> are {{typically}} between 3/4 and 1 in in width.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} 1848 ribbon, {{worn with}} the original wide <b>suspender</b> version of the medal, is 38 millimetres wide and Navy blue, with 7 millimetres wide white edges. Along with the second version of the medal with its narrower <b>suspender</b> that was introduced in 1874, the ribbon dimensions were changed to 32 millimetres wide and Navy blue, with 6½ millimetres wide white edges.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the main}} cables curve and the <b>suspender</b> cables splay outward {{to the deck}} edge, the saddle design is {{individual}} to the location, being fabricated in mirror image pairs for each side. In mid-June 2012, most saddles were in place upon the main cable. Wire rope <b>suspender</b> cables were then draped over these saddles and later were pulled outward and attached to projections from the main deck.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the large}} number of these medals that were awarded during the long reign of Queen Victoria, new dies had to be cut from time to time, which {{resulted}} in differences in appearance. In 1855 a Victoria version of the medal with new swivelling scroll <b>suspender</b> began to be produced. The <b>suspender</b> was affixed to the medal by means of a double-toe claw and a horizontal pin through the upper edge of the medal.|$|E

50|$|Materials {{used for}} making <b>suspenders</b> have also changed over time, with newer {{additions}} such as rayon, a hard-wearing synthetic fiber, now offered. The traditional Woolen Boxcloth <b>Suspenders</b> remain available but are very costly, a style often worn by senior lawyers in London. Generally, {{a high quality}} rayon with elastic webbing is the fabric used to create <b>suspenders,</b> with silks webbing or tubed suiting cloths from mills such as Dugdale Bros of England also used.|$|R
5000|$|In {{traditional}} or formal settings, it {{is considered}} a faux pas to wear both belt and <b>suspenders</b> at the same time, though in the past this {{has not always been}} the case. Further, <b>suspenders</b> were traditionally considered an undergarment and, as such, were considered inappropriate to be seen. From their time of their invention until World War II, the waistcoat, or a jumper or cardigan for coolness in the summer, covered <b>suspenders</b> to prevent indecency. Similarly, jumpers and jackets kept the shirtsleeves hidden. In the inter-war period, however, men began removing jackets in public, and so this sensibility became eroded over time. It is perhaps only in Britain that a few 'die-hards' still consider it [...] "gauche" [...] to wear, for example, brightly colored <b>suspenders</b> without jacket. Generally, it is now considered acceptable fashion, {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, for men's <b>suspenders</b> to be seen.|$|R
25|$|The medal is a disk, 47 millimetres in {{diameter}} and struck in bronze. Without <b>suspender,</b> it weighs 48.42 grams. A bronze ring <b>suspender,</b> formed from 1.65-millimetre-diameter wire, passes {{through a hole in}} a spherical bronze knob, 7 millimetres {{in diameter}} and fused {{to the top of the}} medal. The medal was minted by Messrs. Begeer of Utrecht in Holland, now known as Naamlooze Vennootschap Atelier voor Edelsmeed- en Penningkunst voorheen Koninklijke Begeer, Voorschoten.|$|E
25|$|The medal {{was struck}} in silver {{and is a}} disk, 36 millimetres in {{diameter}} and with a raised rim on both sides. The <b>suspender</b> is an ornamented scroll pattern swiveling type, affixed to the medal {{by means of a}} claw and a horizontal pin through the upper edge of the medal. On the Queen Victoria version the <b>suspender</b> mount is a double-toe claw, while the King Edward VII version has a single-toe claw.|$|E

5000|$|The {{olive drab}} U.S. Army Shade 7 cotton canvas [...] "Suspenders, Individual Equipment Belt" [...] (also {{designated}} [...] "Suspenders, Field Pack, Combat, M-1956") were manufactured in Regular (FSN 8465-577-4922), Long (FSN 8465-577-4923), and X-Long (FSN 8465-823-7231) lengths to United States military specification MIL-S-40160. They are additionally adjustable in length {{by means of}} sliding metal friction fasteners. Early production individual equipment belt <b>suspenders</b> attach to the individual equipment belt by means of open bent-wire hooks which {{are attached to the}} individual equipment belt's upper set of eyelets. Later production individual equipment belt <b>suspenders</b> utilize closing hooks in the rear and open cast hooks in the front. The individual equipment belt <b>suspenders</b> feature a row of web straps over the shoulders for attaching equipment and each side featured a metal rectangular ring where the frontal web straps and the padded shoulder portion joined for additional equipment attachment. The underside of the padded portion of the <b>suspenders</b> is a thinner canvas in earlier-production <b>suspenders</b> and nylon in some of the latest examples.|$|R

25|$|The reverse {{remained}} unaltered, {{while the}} <b>suspender</b> was still either a large ring or a rectangular wire bar, {{attached to the}} medal with an apparently silver clip.|$|E
25|$|The Kimberley Star was six-pointed, {{with a ball}} on {{each point}} and struck in silver, {{to fit into a}} 46 millimetres {{diameter}} circle. Two Kimberley Stars were struck in gold. The star is attached to the <b>suspender</b> by a ring, which passes through an eyelet formed in the uppermost point-ball of the star. The suspension is in two parts, a decorated bar with an eyelet on the reverse for the <b>suspender</b> ring to pass through and a plain bar {{at the top of the}} ribbon with a brooch-pin on the reverse.|$|E

25|$|On a {{conventional}} suspension bridge, sections of deck are hung {{in place and}} so immediately tension the suspenders. The proper initial length of each <b>suspender</b> is predetermined by engineering calculations and adjustments are required for segment relative positioning and equality of load distribution amongst the several suspenders of the section. On this bridge, the deck sections were already in a fixed relative position (being joined together and resting upon the falsework) and all <b>suspender</b> cables must be brought to specific tensions individually in order to tension the main cable. A jacking saddle on the western end is used to balance the tension among the sections of the single main cable.|$|E
25|$|The medal has a {{swiveling}} ornamented scroll pattern <b>suspender,</b> {{attached to}} the medal with a single-toe claw and a horizontal pin through the upper edge of the medal, with double scroll claw supports on the medal rim.|$|E

5000|$|Hawes urged men {{and women}} to speak up for {{clothing}} that suited their lifestyles. For example, in 1938 she used men's <b>suspenders</b> to illustrate how the fashion industry forced substandard-quality but [...] "fashionable" [...] merchandise upon consumers. Hawes interviewed normal men and found they universally preferred wide elastic <b>suspenders</b> with button fastenings, but could only buy narrow <b>suspenders</b> that cut into their shoulders, with metal grips that tore their trousers. Hawes used this to illustrate her point that the fashion system worked against the customer, offering poorly made clothing not intended to last beyond a single season.|$|R
