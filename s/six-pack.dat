5|$|Since the 1980s, several parties, {{including}} the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), the British Heart Foundation, the City of New York, and the Spanish government, {{have argued that}} Burger King has contributed to obesity and unhealthy eating behaviors in Western nations by producing products that contain large amounts of salt, fat, trans-fat and calories. After its purchase by TPG Capital from former parent company Diageo in 2002, the company introduced several large, over-sized products including its European BK XXL line, the British Angus burger <b>six-pack,</b> the Enormous Omelet Sandwich line and the BK Stacker line. These new offerings, and others like them, have resulted in further international scorn and negative attention due the large portion size and increased amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats in these items. Many consumer groups have accused Burger King and other fast food restaurant chains of failing to provide healthier alternatives.|$|E

After successfully defending the title against Sheamus at Hell in a Cell, Orton feuded with Wade Barrett, who was blackmailing Cena to help him capture the title. Orton lost to Barrett via disqualification at Bragging Rights, but retained the title.

The match was rescheduled for the 8 November episode of SmackDown Live, where Lynch successfully defended the title, albeit in controversial fashion (the referee did not see Bliss' foot on the rope when she submitted to her finishing maneuver, the Dis-arm-her). Lynch was a part of Team SmackDown at Survivor Series on 20 November, where she was the last woman from the team to be eliminated during the traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination match.|$|E
5|$|Following {{her first}} face turn, Stratus began wrestling part-time. She {{teamed up with}} Lita against then-heels, Stacy Keibler and Torrie Wilson at InVasion. After {{suffering}} an ankle injury in the summer, however, she was sidelined for the following three months. This interrupted not only her recent venture into wrestling, but also an on-screen romance with Jeff Hardy and budding storyline with Team Xtreme. As she rehabilitated, she kept herself visible by co-hosting Excess on TNN. After returning in autumn, Stratus appeared at Survivor Series where she won the WWF Women's Championship {{for the first time}} in a <b>six-pack</b> challenge. Stratus was next involved in a feud with Jazz over the Women's Championship, where she retained the championship at the Royal Rumble, but dropped the championship to Jazz two weeks later on the February 4, 2002 episode of Raw. Stratus then attempted to regain the title for several months, including competing in a triple threat match at WrestleMania X8 against Lita and Jazz in her hometown of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, but failed to win the match. While chasing after the Women's Championship, Stratus won the WWE Hardcore Championship on May 6, pinning Crash Holly after Bubba Ray Dudley hit him over the head with a trash can. She lost the title to Steven Richards soon afterward however, due to the stipulation that the belt was to be defended 24/7 as long as there was a referee present. One week later, she regained the Women's Championship in a tag team match with Bubba Ray Dudley. During this time, Stratus began wrestling solely on the Raw brand after being drafted in the WWF Brand Extension.|$|E

He then feuded with Kingston over the U.S. Title and earned himself {{a spot in the}} <b>six-pack</b> challenge at Night of Champions.

25|$|Every player's {{character}} is assigned six clones, {{known as a}} <b>six-pack,</b> which are used to replace the preceding clone upon his or her death. The game lacks a conventional health system; most wounds the player characters can suffer {{are assumed to be}} fatal. As a result, Paranoia allows characters to be routinely killed, yet the player can continue instead of leaving the game. This easy spending of clones tends to lead to frequent firefights, gruesome slapstick, and the horrible yet humorous demise of most if not all of the player character's clone family. Additional clones can be purchased if one gains sufficient favour with the Computer.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, a system's linecount {{depended}} on the user limit of the GSBL purchased with the BBS. The GSBL (and thus the BBS) was offered in 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 user editions. Later, {{with the release of}} version 6, the concept of user <b>six-packs</b> was introduced. System operators (SysOps) purchased as many packs as they needed to add additional lines, up to 256.|$|R
50|$|Several {{revisions}} to the act {{have been made to}} reflect changes to liquor laws in Ontario, such as in 2015, when premier Kathleen Wynne and her advisor Ed Clark allowed the sale of <b>six-packs</b> of beer in Ontario grocery stores amid a Toronto Star exclusive on the anti-competitive practices made by The Beer Store. The changes took effect on December 15, 2015, when 58 grocery stores throughout the province began selling beer.|$|R

One of the first <b>six-packs</b> contained characters from the Green Lantern mythos, while another revolves around Gotham City.|$|R
25|$|The Miz and Maryse {{continued}} their impersonation of John Cena and Nikki Bella. They claimed credit for Cena proposing to Nikki and mocked the newly-engaged couple, {{as they were}} {{taking a break from}} WWE post-WrestleMania. As they were leaving the ring, they were interrupted by the main roster debut of Shinsuke Nakamura. The Miz and Maryse were then moved to Raw, where they resumed their rivalry with Dean Ambrose. Jinder Mahal moved to SmackDown, where he continued his feud with Mojo Rawley and Rob Gronkowski. Rawley defeated Mahal following interference by Gronkowski. Both Mahal and Rawley then participated in a <b>six-pack</b> challenge, which Mahal won to become the #1 contender for the WWE Championship at Backlash.|$|E
25|$|Jericho was {{punished for}} not showing {{solidarity}} against Nexus, {{when he was}} removed from a <b>Six-Pack</b> Challenge for Sheamus' WWE Championship at WWE Night of Champions. Although he re-earned {{his place in the}} match after defeating the Hart Dynasty in a 2-on-1 handicap Steel Cage match, however, he was the first man eliminated from the match at the Night of Champions pay-per-view. On the September 27 episode of Raw, Jericho faced Randy Orton who punted him in the head. This was used to explain Jericho's departure from the company. The match ended in a draw due to the no contest nature of the finish. Jericho later told WWE.com that he wouldn't be a full-time superstar again during his career due to his music commitments with band Fozzy.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, at Haas' urging, the Boston Red Sox drafted Youkilis in {{the eighth}} round (243rd overall), {{to the chagrin of}} Billy Beane, who had hoped that {{he would be able to}} draft him in a later round. ESPN {{reported}} that: [...] "questions about his defense and power with wood kept him out of the top part of the draft." [...] He signed for a mere $12,000 signing bonus. [...] "Kevin would have played for a <b>six-pack</b> of beer", his father said.|$|E
50|$|Supermalt is a malt {{drink that}} is non-alcoholic and {{caffeine}} free. It {{has a high}} content of B-vitamin, minerals and nutrients, and has a balance of carbohydrates that supposedly allows instant absorption. It is very dark brown in colour, and has a sweet flavour. Supermalt may be purchased in 330ml glass bottles, cartons or cans, sold individually or in their respective <b>six-packs,</b> available in major supermarket chains in the UK such as Tesco, Asda/Walmart, Sainsbury‚Äôs, Iceland and Morrisons.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{comparison}} is cargo capacity. One practical use is commuting and/or shopping. A humorous competition demonstrated that a Quattrovelo can hold 26 <b>six-packs</b> of beer in glass bottles [...] Although {{the competition was}} humorous, it demonstrates the practical stowage capacity of the Quattrovelo is both much larger than most [...] "speed" [...] velos, and also large enough for many daily uses. Another use is carrying a passenger. The Quattrovelo is offered standard with a second seat for a small (non-pedaling) rider.|$|R
5000|$|Coneheads {{have much}} larger appetites than an average human. They eat {{large amounts of}} food during meals, announcing [...] "Consume mass quantities!" [...] They drink entire six packs of beer at once, and smoke whole packs of {{cigarettes}} at a time. They also consume foods that are inedible to humans, including cleaning fluid, pencil shavings and insulation. On Halloween in 1977 (specifically, the October 29, 1977, SNL episode), a neighbor complains about the Coneheads' choice of trick-or-treat handouts: <b>six-packs</b> and fried eggs.|$|R
