40|$|Traffic {{loading data}} are {{essential}} for the planning and design of adequate and cost-effective highway pavements. Data from an augmented weigh-in-motion (WIM) system have been collected and analyzed. The augmented WIM systems, which comprise bending-plate weighpads, infrared sensors, inductance loop detectors, and thermocouples, were installed in the southbound lanes of Highway 59 in east Texas in 1992. Data have been collected continuously since December 1992 for each vehicle and include date, time, lane, speed, number of axles, axle spacing, and wheel loads. The infrared sensors measure the lateral position of vehicle tires in the traffic lane and indicate single or dual tires. Hourly pavement and air temperatures are recorded by the thermocouples. While some preliminary data analysis is done on-site by the WIM-system computer, an Excel <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>macro</b> computer program was written for further data analysis, including vehicle classification and calculation of equivalent single axle loads (ESALs), a common way of expressing traffic loading.

40|$|Many {{urban and}} {{regional}} planning situations involve informal queries about physical environments such as "What's there? " or "What {{would it be}} like if [...] . ? ". These queries may be supplemented with a variety of geographically-based information such as maps, images, narrative descriptions, and the output of analytic tools. Unfortunately, many analytic tools, (such as population forecasting models, etc.), lack the descriptive abilities of images and human gestures. For example, while a <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>macro</b> may supply the population density of a given area, it is not able to provide an example of "how crowded the streets will be ". Similarly, quantitative representations of environmental impacts, such as noise, may be meaningless to the lay person. This paper explores the implementation of a collaborative multimedia system designed to improve the communication of planning-related information. This is being accomplished through the integration of maps, analytic tools, multimedia images, and other relevant data. The resulting information base is projected on the wall of a meeting room.

40|$|Structures in many environments {{experience}} both {{random and}} harmonic excitation. A variety of closed-form techniques {{has been used}} in the aerospace industry to combine the loads resulting from the two sources. The resulting combined loads are then used to design for both yield ultimate strength and high cycle fatigue capability. This paper examines the cumulative distribution function (CDF) percentiles obtained using each method by integrating the joint probability density function of the sine and random components. A new Microsoft Excel <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>macro</b> that links with the software program Mathematics is then used to calculate the combined value corresponding to any desired percentile along with a curve fit to this value. Another Excel macro is used to calculate the combination using a Monte Carlo simulation. Unlike the traditional techniques, these methods quantify the calculated load value with a Consistent percentile. Using either of the presented methods can be extremely valuable in probabilistic design, which requires a statistical characterization of the loading. Also, since the CDF at high probability levels is very flat, the design value is extremely sensitive to the predetermined percentile; therefore, applying the new techniques can lower the design loading substantially without losing any of the identified structural reliability...|$|E

40|$|Small {{space flight}} project design at NASA Langley Research Center {{goes through a}} {{multi-phase}} process from preliminary analysis to flight operations. The process insures that each system achieves its technical objectives with demonstrated quality and within planned budgets and schedules. A key technical component of early phases is decision analysis, which is a structure procedure for determining {{the best of a}} number of feasible concepts based upon project objectives. Feasible system concepts are generated by the designers and analyzed for schedule, cost, risk, and technical measures. Each performance measure value is normalized between the best and worst values and a weighted average score of all measures is calculated for each concept. The concept(s) with the highest scores are retained, while others are eliminated from further analysis. This project automated and enhanced the decision analysis process. Automation of the decision analysis process was done by creating a user-friendly, menu-driven, <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>macro</b> based decision analysis software program. The program contains data entry dialog boxes, automated data and output report generation, and automated output chart generation. The enhancements to the decision analysis process permit stochastic data entry and analysis. Rather than enter single measure values, the designers enter the range and most likely value for each measure and concept. The data can be entered at the system or subsystem level. System level data can be calculated as either sum, maximum, or product functions of the subsystem data. For each concept, the probability distributions are approximated for each measure and the total score for each concept as either constant, triangular, normal, or log-normal distributions. Based on these distributions, formulas are derived for the probability that the concept meets any given constraint, the probability that the concept meets all constraints, and the probability that the concept is within a given amount of the best score. Formulas are also derived for the probability that one concept's total score is within a given amount of a second concept's total score. These probabilistic calculations provide more realistic data entry and output information for designers, enabling designers to better determine which concepts to eliminate and which concepts to retain at the decision points of each design phase...|$|E

40|$|Accurately and {{efficiently}} characterizing the material properties of {{hot mix asphalt}} (HMA) {{is critical to the}} design and development of pavements that can experience repeated loading {{for long periods of time}} and resist fatigue cracking. The Calibrated Mechanistic with Surface Energy (CMSE) method of design to preclude this primary type of distress requires that the HMA material be tested using the Relaxation Modulus (RM) and Repeated Direct Tension (RDT) tests to determine the material properties required for accurate calculations. The RM test requires considerable time to complete and provides results with relatively high variability. Further research has lead to the development of the Viscoelastic Characterization (VEC) test, from which the RM master curve can be developed. Material properties from the RM master curve can be easily determined and applied in the CMSE method. The modified repeated direct tension (RDT*) test removes rest periods and unwanted healing from the RDT test. The RDT* test also allows the dissipated pseudo strain energy (DPSE) to be separated into permanent deformation and fatigue cracking energies. The rate of change in DPSE associated with fatigue can then be applied in the CMSE method. Data sets for these tests are extensive and time consuming to analyze. Microsoft Excel <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>macros</b> were developed to reduce the time required for analysis from an estimated 10 hours to approximately 8 minutes. Testing of 14 different samples showed that the VEC and RDT* tests still required some adjustments in order to get accurate results. The rate of loading in the VEC test must be reduced to allow sufficient testing time to obtain the required data. The RDT* test requires a decrease in the controlling strain levels from 80 mu-epsilon and 350 mu-epsilon to 20 mu-epsilon and 175 mu-epsilon for the undamaged and damaged portions of the test, respectively. Testing of a sample using the new VEC and RDT* test recommendations showed that the recommended changes provided better results. Samples were undamaged where required and damaged portions of the test ran to completion without causing compression or sample failure. Material properties can be accurately determined and applied in the CMSE method...|$|R

The correct way to perform a compound process simulation requires sampling each i. i. d. random variable under the random sum separately.
