It also created its own footwear technology (Rieker Antistress) to help improve <b>shoe</b> <b>support,</b> flexibility and durability.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Köhler’s {{disease is}} the {{idiopathic}} osteochondrosis of the tarsal navicula. It is an uncommon disorder of the foot. Köhler’s {{disease is a}} bening disease and recoverable itself. Main symptom of the disease is pain in the midfoot. Treatment is symptomatic. Generally, surgery is not necessary. The popular choices of treatment are <b>shoe</b> <b>support</b> and cast immobilization. In this article, we presented a-six year old boy who had bilateral Köhler’s disease. Key words: Köhler’s disease, osteochondrosis, foot 1...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{trademark}} is her unconventional fashion on stage. Her 1994 concerts were memorable for dreadlocks {{and extremely}} long sleeves, {{as well as}} for the silver-painted tears. Her 1998 concerts saw her sporting the [...] "burnt" [...] cheek makeup, the [...] "Indian chief" [...] look, and the soleless strap-on boots. At the start of her 2003 concerts her headgear was topped by an inverted <b>shoe</b> <b>supporting</b> a very long feather, and her makeup for that concert went through several changes of painted eye-shades.|$|R
50|$|When training, <b>shoes</b> {{with extra}} <b>support</b> are {{recommended}} because lighter shoes {{do not provide}} sufficient cushioning. Unsupportive shoes can potentially cause injuries. For speed workouts, which imply shorter distances, lighter shoes provide for a consistent stride and greater foot speed. These lighter <b>shoes</b> have less <b>support.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{two years}} Rudolph {{and her mother}} made weekly bus trips to Nashville for {{treatments}} to regain the use of her weakened leg. She also received subsequent at-home massage treatments {{four times a day}} from members of her family and wore an orthopedic <b>shoe</b> for <b>support</b> of her foot for another two years. Because of the treatments she received at Meharry and the daily massages from her family members, Rudolph was able to overcome the debilitating effects of polio and learned to walk without a leg brace or orthopedic <b>shoe</b> for <b>support</b> {{by the time she was}} twelve years old.|$|R

50|$|Most shoe {{manufacturers}} do not {{design for}} the extra space occupied {{by the presence of}} an orthotic. Arch supports can be more than a centimeter in thickness. The expansion of the orthotic market has caused an expansion of the extra depth shoe market, beyond the diabetic <b>shoes.</b> Thinner arch <b>supports</b> obviously are able to fit into a wider range of common <b>shoes.</b> Soft <b>supports</b> will collapse themselves {{under the weight of the}} body above and the tightness of the shoe surrounding them.|$|R

2500|$|Good {{concludes that}} the white shoe is a [...] "red herring": Sometimes even a black raven can {{constitute}} evidence against the hypothesis that all ravens are black, {{so the fact that}} the observation of a white <b>shoe</b> can <b>support</b> it is not surprising and not worth attention. Nicod's criterion is false, according to Good, and so the paradoxical conclusion does not follow.|$|R
50|$|Compared {{to running}} shoes, {{badminton}} shoes have little lateral support. High levels of lateral support {{are useful for}} activities where lateral motion is undesirable and unexpected. Badminton, however, requires powerful lateral movements. A highly built-up lateral support {{will not be able}} to protect the foot in badminton; instead, it will encourage catastrophic collapse at the point where the <b>shoe's</b> <b>support</b> fails, and the player's ankles are not ready for the sudden loading, which can cause sprains. For this reason, players should choose badminton shoes rather than general trainers or running shoes, because proper badminton shoes will have a very thin sole, lower a person's centre of gravity, and therefore result in fewer injuries. Players should also ensure that they learn safe and proper footwork, with the knee and foot in alignment on all lunges. This is more than just a safety concern: proper footwork is also critical in order to move effectively around the court.|$|R
60|$|The dog, {{bored by}} the inaction, had wandered {{back into the}} summer kitchen and resumed his broken slumber. One of the tramps {{was leaning against the}} wall talking with the farmer woman. The other was busily engaged in {{scratching}} his right shin with what remained of the heel of his left <b>shoe.</b> He <b>supported</b> himself with one hand on a small table upon the top of which was a family Bible.|$|R
50|$|Nike Flywire is a thread, {{composed}} of Vectran or nylon, and developed by Nike, {{used in the}} upper of a shoe. The goal of Flywire is to minimize weight and maximize <b>support.</b> <b>Shoes</b> containing Flywire became available for consumer purchase in 2008.|$|R
50|$|Those {{who have}} loose ligaments {{in the legs}} and feet often mistakenly assume that they have flat feet. While their feet have an arch when not {{supporting}} weight, when stood upon, the arch will flatten. This is because the loose ligaments cannot support the arch {{in the way that}} they should. This can make walking and standing painful and tiring.Pain will usually occur in the feet and lower legs, but can also spread to the back due to abnormal standing and walking habits. Wearing shoes that have good arch support can help minimize the discomfort. The underlying problem, however, is not solved by wearing <b>shoes</b> with arch <b>supports</b> or worsened by wearing <b>shoes</b> without arch <b>support.</b> There is currently no cure for the condition.|$|R
25|$|By {{knowing what}} {{developmental}} stages and tasks children follow, treatment and interventions for FAS can {{be tailored to}} helping a person meet developmental tasks and demands successfully. If a person is delayed in the adaptive behavior domain, for instance, then interventions would be recommended to target specific delays through additional education and practice (e.g., practiced instruction on tying shoelaces), giving reminders, or making accommodations (e.g., using slip-on <b>shoes)</b> to <b>support</b> the desired functioning level. This approach is an advance over behavioral interventions, because it takes the person's developmental context into account while developing interventions.|$|R

40|$|Shoes are {{necessary}} for protection and warmth. Normal children do not require <b>shoes</b> for <b>support.</b> There is no scientific evidence that shoes—‘orthopedic’ or otherwise—influence or alter the growth or shape of the normal child's foot except, perhaps, adversely if they fit poorly. Family physicians must understand common variations of normal foot and leg development {{if they are to}} effectively advise and reassure parents about appropriate footwear. Flat feet, knock knees, bow legs, in-toeing, and out-toeing in otherwise normal children can easily be distinguished from similar but more serious deformities associated with disease or congenital anomaly...|$|R
50|$|The {{choice of}} {{footwear}} {{can change the}} impact of prolonged standing. <b>Shoes</b> should <b>support</b> the foot, have shock-absorbing cushions, fit the foot well, and be comfortable. Shoes should not be flat, have heels higher than 5 cm, or change {{the shape of the}} foot. There are also special insoles for shoes that can be used when soft mats or chairs are not available. Additionally the floors in a work area should not be metal or concrete. It is best to have cork or rubber covered floors. Floors should not be slippery.|$|R
25|$|Proper shoeing is {{critical}} {{in the management of}} a horse with bone spavin. Shoes most helpful for these horses include shoes that assist in breakover (like a square or rolled toe, or shoes with wedge pads). <b>Shoes</b> with heel <b>support</b> may also help horses with bone spavin, such as egg bar shoes.|$|R
40|$|Nearly all {{industries}} exhibit geographic concentration. Most {{theories of}} the location of industry explain the persistence of these production centers {{as the result of}} economic ef®ciency. This article argues in-stead that heterogeneity in entrepreneurial opportunities, rather than differential performance, maintains geographic concentration. En-trepreneurs need exposure to existing organizations in the industry to acquire tacit knowledge, obtain important social ties, and build self-con®dence. Thus, the current geographic distribution of pro-duction places important constraints on entrepreneurial activity. Due to these constraints, new foundings tend to reify the existing geographic distribution of production. Empirical evidence from the <b>shoe</b> industry <b>supports</b> this thesis...|$|R
50|$|Because wear on the {{hip joint}} traces to the {{structures}} that support it (the posture of the legs, and ultimately, the feet), proper fitting <b>shoes</b> with adequate <b>support</b> {{are important to}} preventing GTPS. For someone who has flat feet, wearing proper orthotic inserts and replacing them as often as recommended are also important preventive measures.|$|R

He changed his name to Roca, meaning 'rock', after he joined the Communist Party in 1929.|$|R
5000|$|A typical strain {{insulator}} {{is a piece}} of glass or porcelain that is shaped to accommodate two cables or a cable <b>shoe</b> and the <b>supporting</b> hardware on the support structure (hook eye, or eyelet on a steel pole/tower).

50|$|By September 26, it {{was decided}} that Barbaro's cast would not be {{replaced}} {{as long as he was}} comfortable in it. His left hind hoof had regrown about 18 millimeters and the <b>support</b> <b>shoe</b> had been replaced with a bandage. The hoof would have to grow to at least three times that length, a process that could take more than six months.|$|R
50|$|Walking {{for long}} periods in {{flip-flops}} can be very tough on the feet, resulting in pain in the ankles, legs, and feet. A 2009 study at Auburn University found that flip-flop wearers took shorter steps and their heels hit the ground with less vertical force than those wearing athletic shoes. Individuals with flat feet or other foot issues are advised to wear a <b>shoe</b> with better <b>support.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The flash {{connector}} {{was different}} from other 50s era stereo cameras; instead of the then-standard old style hot shoe (usually called an [...] "accessory clip") it featured a bayonet type connector, which was an emerging standard in the later 50s. Unlike the hot <b>shoe,</b> it couldn't <b>support</b> a flash unit on its own. A separate L bracket was needed to physically hold the flash.|$|R

5000|$|Bloch {{employs a}} pointe shoe {{manufacturing}} method known as turnshoe. Bloch pointe shoes use three different recipes of paste in the toe box. The standard paste, [...] "paste A", is a firm, hard paste, that was formulated to withstand varying heat and humidity. [...] "Paste B" [...] is more malleable and thus allows the shoe to more quickly mold {{to the shape}} of the foot; because of its high malleability, this paste breaks down (i.e., <b>shoe</b> structural <b>support</b> degrades) faster than paste A. A third recipe, known as [...] "TMT™" [...] or [...] "Thermo-Morph Technology" [...] paste, is a heat activated material that allows the shoe to be molded to the foot when subjected to directed hot air from a hair dryer.|$|R

She volunteered with numerous {{organizations such as}} the LA Prom Closet, a nonprofit which gives underprivileged girls the chance to fully enjoy their prom, complete with dress and <b>shoes.</b> She has <b>supported</b> AIDS awareness organizations including the Red Pump Project to support National Women & Girl’s HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, and the TransgiaDivas event organized by the Minority AIDS Project.|$|R
40|$|A new {{centerless}} grinding method without regulating wheel is proposed. Instead {{of using a}} regulating wheel, this method employs an ultrasonic vibrating <b>shoe</b> to <b>support</b> the workpiece. The end of the vibrating shoe is in elliptic motion at a high frequency, while the rotational speed of the workpiece {{is controlled by the}} elliptic motion of the shoe. An experimental apparatus has been designed and constructed. Tests involving the rotational driving of a workpiece were then conducted on the apparatus, which showed that the workpiece rotational speed depended on the AC voltage and its frequency. Finally, grinding tests involving pin-shaped workpieces with an initial roundness of 20 &# 61549;m were performed. The results showed that the roundness of the workpieces was improved to 1. 5 &# 61549;m after grinding using the new apparatus...|$|R
50|$|In particular, {{the plot}} line {{focuses on the}} story of the MacLean family. Willie MacLean is a 12-year-old boy with a love for horses and liking to school to escape the {{difficult}} times his family has. When the series begins, Willie's father has been dead for over a year from coal consumption, and his older brother, John also died in a mine cave in. When Willie's brother was killed in a cave in and his father wounded two or three years earlier (in the Pit Pony TV movie), Willie was forced to fill his brother's <b>shoes</b> to <b>support</b> his older sister Nellie, and two younger sisters, Maggie and Sarah, until their father recovered. Willie found work at the mine lonely and unfriendly; as a result he forms a bond with a pit pony horse {{in order to make it}} through each day.|$|R
50|$|Flywire {{was created}} by Jay Meschter, Director of Innovation at Nike. He began by taking a last (an object shaped like a foot used to design shoes) and marking the key points of where a <b>shoe</b> needs to <b>support</b> the foot. When Meschter saw an {{embroidery}} machine, he determined the machine {{could be used to}} make long stitches. Long stitches, containing strong, lightweight fibers, would allow fibers to support the foot in key points, instead of using layers of material that support the whole foot.|$|R
50|$|Nell {{was born}} Ellen Quinlan in Parsons, Kansas, the twelfth child of an Irish {{immigrant}} railroad worker and his wife. She attended Parsons High School, and following graduation, {{worked as a}} stenographer in Kansas City where, aged 17, she married a fellow tenant at her boarding-house, Paul J. Donnelly. A local representative for a <b>shoe</b> company, Donnelly <b>supported</b> her by pooling his earnings with hers to fund her studies at Lindenwood College where at the time, {{she was the only}} student to be married.|$|R

He struggles to write, despite sleep-deprived and irritable. Yet, he escapes from reality through nightly excursions, apparently to the movies but also to local bars. It is loosely implied {{that he is a}} closeted homosexual and his excursions might actually involve anonymous encounters with random men. Tom feels both obligated toward yet burdened by his family and longs to escape.|$|R
25|$|The {{birth of}} the modern pointe shoe is often {{attributed}} to the early 20th-century Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, {{who was one of}} the most famous and influential dancers of her time. Pavlova had particularly high, arched insteps, which left her vulnerable to injury when dancing en pointe. She also had slender, tapered feet, which resulted in excessive pressure on her big toes. To compensate for this, she inserted toughened leather soles into her <b>shoes</b> for extra <b>support</b> and flattened and hardened the toe area to form a box.|$|R
