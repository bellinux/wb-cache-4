50|$|An {{accident}} {{during a}} <b>stunt</b> <b>flight</b> {{resulted in the}} death of Jim LeRoy, who was pronounced dead on July 28, 2007 in a military MEDEVAC helicopter while in transit to Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio. The reason of this crash was reported as pilot error by the NTSB.|$|E
5000|$|Osterud’s last <b>stunt</b> <b>flight</b> ended abruptly, {{when she}} crashed during an airshow at the MCAS Yuma Airshow in Yuma, Arizona, at the MCAS, Yuma International Airport on April 11, 1997. She was flying her Ultimate 10-300S biplane in a {{performance}} at the airshow she called [...] "Ring of Fire," [...] which she had performed numerous {{times over the years}} both in the United States and abroad. The stunt centered on a giant ring of flames at center stage of the show. She would make multiple passes through the flaming ring, and on the last pass, flew upside down and cut a ribbon suspended between two poles with the tail of her plane, while the plane was 10-20 feet off the ground. According to the NTSB accident report, Osterud had personally chosen the location for the poles and ribbon, which was just to the south of the runway over old asphalt and concrete. This meant that her path was free of any obstacles and would parallel the runway. She planned to cut the ribbon while flying inverted on her third pass, and then land. She ended up flying at dusk, and then had to fly directly into the setting sun before turning around for her last pass, which was the one that was upside down. [...] "I remember the turn-around at the west end, rolling inverted and establishing my sight picture for the run-in. However, the next few seconds are a total blank in my memory. I can remember the sound of the impact, but my recollection of a visual picture resumes only with the sparks created by the inverted slide." [...] Osterud crashed into the runway while upside down on the third pass, totaling the plane, but was able {{to walk away from the}} crash unhurt. She apparently went back to the grandstand covered in soot, dirt and mud in her hair and apologized to the crowd for crashing. Her insurance covered the remaining debt on the plane, but didn’t leave enough for her to buy another plane. This crash ended her stunt career. The NTSB inspector found no mechanical or engine problems with the plane and cited “the pilot's failure to maintain adequate vertical clearance from the runway, while flying inverted” as well as “the light conditions at dusk, and the pilot's lack of visual ques due to the light conditions” as factors relating to the accident.|$|E
50|$|Machado was {{the first}} female pilot in Brazil to carry passengers, to become a {{journalist}} writing exclusively on matters of aviation, to make <b>stunt</b> <b>flights,</b> {{and to make a}} cross-country flight. She made the cross-country flight in 1922, and when she finished Santos Dumont gave her a gold medal, a replica of one given to him by Isabel de Bragança. Anesia kept it as a good luck charm.|$|R

5000|$|When Connie's daily strip began, on May 13, 1929, {{she became}} [...] "flighty" [...] in a {{different}} sense. There, she was played as an adventuring aviator, and the strips her series fit right in with included Tailspin Tommy, Skyroads and the early Brick Bradford—except, of course, for her gender. Connie was the first female adventure hero in American comics, the precursor to Brenda Starr, Deathless Deer, Modesty Blaise and all the rest. Connie (last name Kurridge—sounds like [...] "courage", get it?) was deceptively pretty, tho {{as a product of}} the flapper era, rather flat-chested compared to modern comics women. Neither villains nor readers back then expected to find an agile and resourceful brain beneath her lovely blonde curls. And she was capable of spectacular feats of derring-do, such as flying great distances cross-country in an unfamiliar plane, at night, with neither navigational equipment nor lights; or performing <b>stunt</b> <b>flights</b> in a plane she knew had recently been sabotaged.|$|R
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{achievement of}} these projects, however, {{was the first}} flight around the world. The Air Service set up support facilities along the proposed route and in April 1924 sent a flight of four aircraft west from Seattle, Washington. Six months later, two aircraft completed the flight. Even if considered as primarily a publicity <b>stunt,</b> the <b>flight</b> was a brilliant accomplishment in which five nations had already failed.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2013 it was {{announced}} that the terminal would be known as [...] "Terminal 2 - The Queen's Terminal". The terminal features a sculpture designed by Richard Wilson, called Slipstream. It has been designed to resemble a <b>stunt</b> aircraft in <b>flight,</b> and has been described as the longest permanent sculpture in Europe. A second sculpture, named Emergence, was created by Cinimod Studio and is suspended within the terminal.|$|R
50|$|While the Vostok {{programme}} {{was dedicated}} more toward understanding {{the effects of}} space travel and microgravity on the human body, Voskhod's two flights were more aimed towards spectacular firsts. Although achieving the first EVA ("spacewalk") became the main success of the programme, beating the U.S. Project Gemini to put the first multiman crew in orbit was the objective that initially motivated the programme. After those goals were realized, the programme planned to focus on other advances the spacecraft could accomplish, such as longer duration and a second female flight. However, there were delays preparing for Voskhod 3, {{and during that time}} the Gemini programme accomplished most of what had been planned for future Voskhods. In the end, the Voskhod programme was abandoned, aided by a change in Soviet leadership which was less concerned about <b>stunt</b> and prestige <b>flights,</b> and this allowed the Soviet designers to concentrate on the Soyuz programme.|$|R
