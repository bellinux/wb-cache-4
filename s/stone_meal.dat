In the region of Bern it merged with the Aar Glacier. The glaciers of the Reuss, the Limmat and the Rhine advanced sometimes as well until the Jura. The glaciers formed the land by erosion, but also by base moraines (very fine <b>stone</b> <b>meal)</b> often several meters thick, and by the meltwater streams depositing gravel.|$|E

To evaluate its efficacy, three experimental diets containing 0, 3 or 6 % olive <b>stone</b> <b>meal</b> were fed to 222 rabbits from weaning (28 d) to slaughter (73 d). Olive stone inclusion increased the proportion of large dietary particles while did not affect growth performance, digestive physiology and carcass and meat quality.

40|$|In organic seed {{production}} {{more than a}} half of seed lots are often discarded due to heavy infection with seed borne pathogens. To prevent this, various techniques are used: seed heat treatment, ultrasound treatment, brush cleaning and seed dressing with plant extracts or natural chemicals. In 2008, the efficiency of wheat seed treatment with the <b>stone</b> <b>meal</b> was tested and the results of preliminary investigation are presented. Two tests were performed using the official procedure for seed health testing. Test 1 : Heavily infected wheat seed was treated with the <b>stone</b> <b>meal</b> EKORAST (particle size < 0. 08 mm). Dry and wet treatment procedures were applied: both with 1, 2, 10 and 20 %. Heavy application (10 and 20 kg per 100 kg of seed) significantly increased germination and energy of wheat seed, and it was effective against bacterial pathogens and some fungi, but only partially effective against heavy infection of Fusarium spp. However, the amounts of <b>stone</b> <b>meal</b> (10 and 20 %) are practically not applicable, and adhesion of <b>stone</b> <b>meal</b> to the seed should be improved. Test 2 : Wheat cleaned seed of seven genotypes was wet treated with Ekorast (1 %) and chemical fungicide Vitavax 200 FF (250 ml/ 100 kg). The untreated seed was used as control. There {{were no significant differences between}} the three variants in germination and energy. The <b>stone</b> <b>meal</b> Eko-rast was equal or better than Vitavax 200 FF in seed protection against seed borne pathogens, and could be recommended for seed treatment in organic {{seed production}}. Search for an additive with better adhesion to seed is under way...|$|E

40|$|The project {{examines}} {{the control of}} downy mildew (Plasmopara viticola) in organic viticulture based on copper replacement and copper reduction strategies, respectively. The replacement agents or the new copper formulations with minimised copper dose will {{be integrated into the}} “organic standard” strategy, which additionally aims at the control of other pests and diseases. The following agents were tested: plant strengtheners, plant extracts and <b>stone</b> <b>meals.</b> Despite unclear situations regarding commercialisation and registration purposes, respectively, bacterial antagonists and phosphoric acid were also included. After a screening on potted vines, agents were tested in the test-vineyards of six different research stations for viticulture and plant protection. The last step should be the application on four pilot sites under practical conditions. Based on the results of the first growing period (2004), agents and strategies could be selected for large scale and practical use by organic vinegrowers. Algae products and new copper formulations have been proven to be highly effective against P. viticola in the greenhouse {{as well as in the}} field...|$|R

Some ancient <b>mealing</b> <b>stones</b> of this prehistoric tribe were found near Saticoy in 1932 and traced back to about 3000 B.C. In about the early 15th century, the Chumash tribe inhabited the area. They built canoes and milled the acorns.|$|R
40|$|Pollen beetle (Meligethes spp.) {{is a major}} yield-limiting {{factor in}} organic oilseed production. Currently there are no {{effective}} methods available to control this beetle in organic agriculture. From 2006 to 2008 work was carried out at Agroscope ARTReckenholz to find suitable organically compatible plant protecting agents which are effective against the beetle. A partial reduction in beetle infestation was observed when liquid manure, lavender oil and rapeseed oil was applied. Dusting agents such as ash and substances containing silicate (<b>stone</b> <b>meal)</b> were very efficient, almost completely removing the beetle after application. However, beetle infestation increased again after {{one or two days}} following application. Dusting substances in combination with pine oil and rapeseed oil produced the best results with an effective period of action of up to five days. The addition of vegetable oil is assumed to improve the adhesiveness of these agents. None of the methods showed any significant effects on oilseed yield. Practical use will require further tests and investigations into economic feasibility and application technology...|$|E
40|$|Many soil {{functions}} {{depend on the}} interaction of water with soil. The affinity of water for soils can be altered by applying soilamendments like <b>stone</b> <b>meal,</b> manure, or biochar (a carbonaceous material obtained by pyrolysis of biomasses). In fact, the addi-tion of hydrophobic biochar to soil may increase soil repellency, reduce water-adsorbing capacity, inhibit microbial activity, altersoil filter, buffer, storage, and transformation functions. For this reason, it {{is of paramount importance}} to monitor water affinity forbiochar surface (also referred to as ‘wettability’) in order to better address its applications in soil systems. In this study, we proposethe use of fast field cycling NMR relaxometry technique with the application of a new mathematical model for data interpretation,as a valid alternative to the traditional contact angle (CA) measurements for biochar wettability evaluation. Either NMR or CA re-sults revealed the same wettability trend for the biochars studied here. The advantage of NMR relaxometry over CA measurementslies in the possibility to obtain at the microscopic level a variety of different information in only one shot. In fact, while CA providesonly wettability evaluation, NMR relaxometry also allows achievement of the mechanisms for water molecular dynamics onbiochar surface, thereby leading to the possibility to understand better, in future research, the role of biochar in increasing soilquality and plant nutrition...|$|E

50|$|The {{presence}} of ground stone at Vail Pass Camp is unusual since high elevation sites do not typically yield {{a significant number}} of grinding implements. The ground stone is separated into two groups: manos and metates. There is a total of 41 manos collected at this site, and ninety percent of them are composed of the local Maroon Sandstone. Eleven metates were found at this site and are mainly fragmentary, or in various states of reconstruction. A metate (or <b>mealing</b> <b>stone)</b> is a mortar, a ground stone tool used for processing grain and seeds. The mano was used to grind the grain or seed on the metate.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{versions of}} the cotton gin consisted of a single roller made of iron or wood and a flat piece of stone or wood. Evidence {{for this type of}} gin has been found in Africa, Asia, and North America. The first documentation of the cotton gin by contemporary scholars is found in the fifth century A.D., in the form of Buddhist paintings depicting a single-roller gin in the Ajanta Caves in western India. These early gins were difficult to use and required a great deal of skill. A narrow single roller was necessary to expel the seeds from the cotton without crushing the seeds. The design was similar to that of a <b>mealing</b> <b>stone,</b> which was used to grind grain. The early history of the cotton gin is ambiguous, because archeologists likely mistook the cotton gin's parts for other tools.|$|R
40|$|The {{processing}} of fruits results in high amounts of waste {{materials such as}} peels, seeds, <b>stones,</b> and oilseed <b>meals.</b> A disposal of these materials usually represents a problem that is further aggravated by legal restrictions. Thus new aspects concerning {{the use of these}} wastes as by-products for further exploitation on the production of food additives or supplements with high nutritional value have gained increasing interest because these are high-value products and their recovery may be economically attractive. It is well known that by-products represent an important source of sugars, minerals, organic acid, dietary fibre and phenolics which have a wide range of action which includes antitumoral, antiviral, antibacterial, cardioprotective and antimutagenic activities. This review discusses the potential of the most important by-products of apple, grape and citrus fruits processing as a source of valuable compounds.

6000|$|HALF the world, it is said, knows not how {{the other}} half live. Our Exploring Expedition saw the Feejee islanders getting their dinner off human bones; and {{they are said to}} eat their own wives and children. The {{husbandry}} of the modern inhabitants of Gournou (west of old Thebes) is philosophical to a fault. To set up their housekeeping nothing is requisite but two or three earthen pots, a <b>stone</b> to grind <b>meal,</b> and a mat which is the bed. The house, namely a tomb, is ready without rent or taxes. No rain can pass through the roof, and there is no door, for there is no want of one, as there is nothing to lose. If the house do not please them, they walk out and enter another, as there are several hundreds at their command. [...] "It is somewhat singular," [...] adds Belzoni, to whom we owe this account, [...] "to talk of happiness among people who live in sepulchres, among the corpses and rags of an ancient nation which they know nothing of." [...] In the deserts of Borgoo the rock-Tibboos still dwell in caves, like cliff-swallows, and the language of these negroes is compared by their neighbors to the shrieking of bats and to the whistling of birds. Again, the Bornoos have no proper names; individuals are called after their height, thickness, or other accidental quality, and have nicknames merely. But the salt, the dates, the ivory, and the gold, for which these horrible regions are visited, find their way into countries where the purchaser and consumer can hardly be ranked in one race with these cannibals and man-stealers; countries where man serves himself with metals, wood, stone, glass, gum, cotton, silk, and wool; honors himself with architecture; writes laws, and contrives to execute his will through the hands of many nations; and, especially, establishes a select society, running through all the countries of intelligent men, a self-constituted aristocracy, or fraternity of the best, which, without written law or exact usage of any kind, perpetuates itself, colonizes every new-planted island and adopts and makes its own whatever personal beauty or extraordinary native endowment anywhere appears.|$|R
40|$|Feed {{represents}} about 60 - 65 % of production cost of poultry projects. The balanced feed is {{considered as a}} corner stone of meeting chicken nutrients requirements and minimizing feed loss. Hence all nutrient compounds needed for growth and production should be availed at exactly required level (Without excess or deficiency). Calcium {{is one of the}} most abundant elements in the body and is often the major cation in the diet. 99 % of the body calcium is located in the skeleton. The remaining 1 % is extremely important in cellular metabolism, blood clotting, enzyme activation and neuromuscular action. Most feed stuffs of plant origin are deficient in calcium because calcium in feed stuffs from plants quite often exists as complexes with phytate and oxalate (chelates), which reduce bioavailability. Hence a ready absorbable source of calcium should be supplemented to plant feed stuff sources. Since not all consumed calcium is available for metabolic requirement, but part of the ingested amount of calcium is absorbed and utilized and can therefore contribute to metabolic requirements. Different sources of calcium are available in Sudan which can be used to meet calcium requirement in poultry feed such as bone <b>meal,</b> lime <b>stone,</b> marble dust and oystershell. This study was conducted to determine the bioavailability of calcium from different locally available sources, by feeding day old broiler chicks with different levels of calcium sources using dicalcium phosphate as a reference standard. A basal diet was formulated to contain low calcium percentage (0. 79 %), referred to as 0 % calcium, and was supplemented with three other levels; 0. 25, 0. 5 and 0. 75 %, resulting in dietary calcium percentage of about 1. 04, 1. 29 and 1. 54 % respectively for each calcium source. The first experiment was conducted in summer season, replicated in winter season and resulted in the following: II Significant (P< 0. 05) differences in total feed intake (g/bird) due to calcium sources and levels during winter season were observed while no significant difference was shown in Summer season. The same pattern of feed intake response had been shown in final body weight gain in birds fed different calcium sources; however, birds exhibited a decline pattern of body weight gain by increasing dietary calcium level for both experiments. Dry matter digestibility of the birds fed the basal diet was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than that of the birds the fed the other calcium levels, while calcium source had no effect on dry matter digestibility in both experiments. There were no seasonal differences in bone ash, while significant (P< 0. 05) differences were observed for the birds fed different calcium levels in a positive correlation response. No seasonal, calcium source or level effects were observed in plasma calcium content, but it tended to decrease in the birds fed increasing dietary calcium levels, and those raised in winter season compared to their counterparts raised in summer season. Relative biological values of calcium from different calcium sources were not statistically different and ranged between 97. 7 and 100. 1 %. Compared to the reference standard dicalcium phosphate (100 %). The relative biological values of calcium were 100. 1, 99. 5, 98. 3 and 97. 7 % for lime <b>stone,</b> bone <b>meal,</b> marble dust and oyster shell respectively. As a conclusion for this study the locally available calcium sources seemed to have similar bioavailability under the conditions of the study, and the assay method of bioavailability used...|$|R
