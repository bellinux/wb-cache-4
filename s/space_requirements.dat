25|$|Rather than {{bounding}} {{the time}} complexity of an algorithm that recognizes an MSO property on bounded-treewidth graphs, {{it is also}} possible to analyze the space complexity of such an algorithm; that is, the amount of memory needed above and beyond the size of the input itself (which is assumed to be represented in a read-only way so that its <b>space</b> <b>requirements</b> cannot be put to other purposes).|$|E
25|$|The {{disconnecting}} {{circuit breaker}} (DCB) {{was introduced in}} 2000 and is a high-voltage circuit breaker modeled after the SF6-breaker. It presents a technical solution where the disconnecting function is integrated in the breaking chamber, {{eliminating the need for}} separate disconnectors. This increases the availability, since open-air disconnecting switch main contacts need maintenance every 2–6 years, while modern circuit breakers have maintenance intervals of 15 years. Implementing a DCB solution also reduces the <b>space</b> <b>requirements</b> within the substation, and increases the reliability, {{due to the lack of}} separate disconnectors.|$|E

25|$|People make {{exceptions}} to and modify their <b>space</b> <b>requirements.</b> A number of relationships may allow for personal space to be modified, including familial ties, romantic partners, friendships and close acquaintances, {{where there is}} a greater degree of trust and personal knowledge. Personal space is affected by a person's position in society, with more affluent individuals expecting a larger personal space. Personal space also varies by gender and age. Males typically use more personal space than females, and personal space has a positive relation to age (people use more as they get older). Most people have a fully developed (adult) sense of personal space by age twelve.|$|E

Two of these conductive layers are wound into a cylinder shaped winding, usually flattened to reduce mounting <b>space</b> <b>requirements</b> on a printed circuit board, or layered as multiple single layers stacked together, to form a capacitor body.

Software keyboards have become very popular in touchscreen enabled cell phones, due to the additional cost and <b>space</b> <b>requirements</b> of other types of hardware keyboards. Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and some varieties of Linux include on-screen keyboards that can be controlled with the mouse.

25|$|For the {{complexity}} classes defined in this way, {{it is desirable}} to prove that relaxing the requirements on (say) computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems. In particular, although DTIME(n) is contained in DTIME(n2), {{it would be interesting}} to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and <b>space</b> <b>requirements,</b> the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.|$|E
25|$|Attempts to {{regulate}} the tianguis commerce in the Zocalo led {{to the establishment of}} several formal markets. However, these markets would never eliminate tianguis commerce in the plaza. The first formal market was the El Parían in 1703, after a major fire in the city. It was originally established as a common market, with all of the Zocalo’s vendors inside. However, the building was not large enough, and the structure’s <b>space</b> <b>requirements</b> pushed remaining outside vendors into the areas belonging to the Cathedral and government building. This market then became space for the various guilds of the city to market their wares. By the end of the 18th century, it would become the market for the upper Spanish and Criollo classes, selling imported merchandise such as that brought be the Manila Galleon. This was the market's height. After this time, it would slowly decay until it was demolished in 1843.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} novel {{algorithm}} based on random graphs to construct minimal perfect hash functions h. For {{a set of}} n keys, our algorithm outputs h in expected time O(n). The evaluation of h(x) requires two memory accesses for any key x and the description of h takes up 1. 15 n words. This improves the <b>space</b> <b>requirement</b> to 55 % of a previous minimal perfect hashing scheme due to Czech, Havas and Majewski. A simple heuristic further reduces the <b>space</b> <b>requirement</b> to 0. 93 n words, {{at the expense of}} a slightly worse constant in the time complexity.

25|$|HO scale's {{popularity}} lies {{somewhat in}} its middle-of-the-road status. It {{is large enough}} to accommodate a great deal of detail in finer models, more so than the smaller N and Z scales, and can also be easily handled by children without as much fear of swallowing small parts. Models are usually less expensive than the smaller scales because of more exacting manufacturing process in N and Z, and also less expensive than S, O and G scales because of the smaller amount of material; the larger audience and the resultant economy of scale also drives HO prices down. The size lends itself to elaborate track plans in a reasonable amount of room space, not as much as N but considerably more than S or 0. In short, HO scale provides the balance between the detail of larger scales and the lower <b>space</b> <b>requirements</b> of smaller scales.|$|E
25|$|Fayetteville–Manlius High School {{was opened}} in 1963 after the 1951 merger of then {{separate}} Fayetteville and Manlius {{school districts and}} subsequent need to consolidate students into a single high school. Upon this opening, a major school restructuring was implemented, as the Fayetteville High School became Wellwood Middle School and Manlius High School became Pleasant Street Elementary (which closed in 1975). A new middle school, Eagle Hill, was also opened directly next {{to the high school}} in 1965. <b>Space</b> <b>requirements,</b> due mainly to ballooning enrollment and continued reorganization {{as a result of the}} 1951 merger, prompted the district to relocate Eagle Hill to a new building on a new campus in 1972, so the high school could expand into the junior high's previous facilities. This expansion, which connected the two buildings, now called House 1 and House 2, by a hallway and an enclosed footbridge, nearly doubled the school's footprint. F-M High School served grades 10 through 12 until 1976, when the two junior high schools became middle schools, and FM High took in 9th graders.|$|E
500|$|The 13-inch gun was 35 calibers {{long and}} used black powder, giving {{a range of}} about [...] at 15 degrees of elevation. At , a shell was {{expected}} to penetrate [...] of side armor. The four guns were mounted in two centerline turrets, located fore and aft. The turrets were originally designed to feature sloping side armor, but <b>space</b> <b>requirements</b> made this impossible without using significantly larger gun turrets or redesigning the gun mounts (which was later done for the s). The ships' low freeboard greatly hindered {{the use of the}} main battery in rough weather conditions, because the deck would become awash. Also, because the ship lacked a counterweight to offset the weight of the gun barrels, the ship would list in the direction the guns were aimed. This reduced the maximum arc of elevation (and thus range) to about 5 degrees, brought the main armor belt under water on that side, and exposed the unarmored bottom on the other. It was considered in 1901 to replace the turrets with new balanced models used in later ships, but that was decided to be too costly as the ships were already obsolete. Instead, counterweights were added, which partially solved the problem. The hydraulic rammers and turning mechanisms of the 8-inch turrets were also replaced by faster and more efficient electric equivalents, new sights were fitted on Indiana and Massachusetts, and new turret hoists were installed to improve the reloading speed, but the gun mountings never performed in an entirely satisfactory manner.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>space</b> <b>requirement</b> of Crochemore’s repetitions {{algorithm}} is generally {{estimated to be}} about 20 mn bytes of memory, where n is {{the length of the}} input string and m the number of bytes required to store the integer n. The same algorithm can also be used in other contexts, for instance to compute the suffix tree of the input string in O(n log n) time for the purpose of data compression. In such contexts the large <b>space</b> <b>requirement</b> of the {{algorithm is}} a significant drawback. There are of course several newer space-efficient algorithms with the same time complexity that can compute suffix trees or arrays. However, in actual implementations, these algorithms may not be faster than Crochemore’s. Therefore, we consider it interesting enough to describe a new approach based on the same mathematical principles and observations that were put forth in Crochemore’s original paper, but whose <b>space</b> <b>requirement</b> is 10 mn bytes. Additional advantages of the approach are the ease with which it can be implemented in C/C++ and the apparent speed of such an implementation in comparison to other implementations of the original algorithm. 1...|$|R
40|$|The Escherichia coli cAMP {{receptor}} protein (CRP) activates transcription initiation at many promoters by binding upstream of core promoter {{elements and}} {{interacting with the}} C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase subunit. Previous studies have shown stringent spacing is required for transcription acti-vation by CRP. Here we report that this stringency can be altered {{by the nature of}} different promoter elements at target promoters. Several series of CRP-dependent promoters were constructed with CRP moved to different upstream locations, and their ac-tivities were measured. The results show that (i) a full UP element, located immediately downstream of the DNA site for CRP, relaxes the <b>spacing</b> <b>requirements</b> for activation and increases the recruitment of RNAP and open complex formation; (ii) the distal UP sub-site plays the key role in this relaxation; (iii) modifi-cation of the extended − 10 element also affects the <b>spacing</b> <b>requirements</b> for CRP-dependent activation. From these results, we conclude that the <b>spacing</b> <b>requirements</b> for CRP-dependent transcription acti-vation vary according to the sequence of different promoter elements, and our results are important for understanding the organization of promoters in many different bacteria which are controlled by transcrip-tion factors that use activatory mechanisms similar to CRP...|$|R
