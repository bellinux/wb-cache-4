5|$|A catastrophic injury such as SCI puts <b>strain</b> <b>on</b> {{marriages and}} other romantic relationships, {{which in turn}} has {{important}} implications for quality of life. Partners of injured people often feel out of control, overwhelmed, angry, and guilty while having added work related to the injury, less help with responsibilities like parenting, and loss of wages. Relationship stress and excessive dependence in relationships increases risk of depression for the person with SCI; supportive relationships are protective.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Western Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire was the sole {{successor}} of the Roman Empire. Charlemagne's imperial coronation in 800 put <b>strain</b> <b>on</b> Western relations with the Byzantine Empire ruled from Constantinople. When Otto I became emperor in February 962, there was contention between him and the Byzantine Empire, and this issue revived in 967 between Otto and Nikephoros II Phokas over the dominion of Italy. On 25 December 967, Pope John XIII anointed Otto II as Otto I's co-emperor.|$|E

5|$|Although {{opened in}} 1800 {{at the cost}} of £100,000, the new harbour at Grimsby failed to attract the levels of trade the company had projected, caused largely by a lack of inland {{transport}} networks. The financial problems facing the Grimsby Haven Company led to factions and difficulty in its running and put <b>strain</b> <b>on</b> Boucherett's relations with Yarborough; having invested much money and time in the now failing company, Boucherett also found it draining of him financially.|$|E
5|$|Another project {{combining}} the T-34 tank chassis with the D-15 gun was also considered. Designated SU-D15, the medium assault gun {{was intended as}} a replacement for the SU-122. Although the project received a lot of support from the authorities it never entered production, both because of its shortcomings (the heavy gun put too much <b>strain</b> <b>on</b> the suspension and ammunition stowage was too limited) and because it was made redundant by the ISU-152. However lessons learned mounting a powerful gun in the T-34 allowed for rapid development of the SU-100 tank destroyer.|$|E
5|$|As well as Groening, Simon {{was often}} {{at odds with}} Brooks and {{production}} company Gracie Films.

Simon did not want to work on either series, both of which were poorly received and swiftly canceled, which put a <b>strain</b> <b>on</b> the pair's relationship.|$|E

Montag increasingly spent more time with Pratt and neglected her friendship with Conrad, which placed a <b>strain</b> <b>on</b> the pair's friendship. Consequentially, Conrad strengthened her relationship with her friend Lo Bosworth and took a romantic interest in Pratt's friend Brody Jenner. Montag and Pratt moved into an apartment together in the season finale, at which point Patridge became Conrad's new housemate.|$|E
5|$|Disruptions in the plantar fascia's normal {{mechanical}} movement during standing and walking (known as the Windlass mechanism) {{are thought to}} {{contribute to the development of}} plantar fasciitis by placing excess <b>strain</b> <b>on</b> the calcaneal tuberosity. Other studies have also suggested that plantar fasciitis is not actually due to inflamed plantar fascia, but may be a tendon injury involving the flexor digitorum brevis muscle located immediately deep to the plantar fascia.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of many coastal nations was increased from 12 to 200 Nmi. The sudden expansion of responsibility dramatically increased the area of ocean requiring surveillance, monitoring and policing by these nations, increasing the <b>strain</b> <b>on</b> existing maritime patrol resources, and highlighting the need for countries without a maritime patrol force to obtain one, especially in the South West Pacific area.|$|E
30|$|However, {{both the}} mass losses of wood powder and of lignin were {{markedly}} {{less in the}} four pPbGPD- MGmnp 2 transformants and the HPT transformant than in the Wt (Table  2). This {{may be due to}} the delayed growth of transformed <b>strains</b> <b>on</b> wood. While there was no difference in the growth rate between Wt and transformed <b>strains</b> <b>on</b> PDA and Kirk media, the growth rate of transformed <b>strains</b> <b>on</b> Quercus wood powder medium was markedly slower (Additional file 1 : Table S 2). Even so, the L/W ratio of the M 14 transformant was significantly higher than that of Wt. These results suggest that the enhancement of MnP 2 activity promotes Klason lignin degradation.|$|R

5|$|In 1600 and 1601 Zamoyski {{took part}} in the war against Sweden {{commanding}} the Commonwealth forces in Livonia (Inflanty). At the same time he was a vocal opponent of that war on the political scene. In 1600 he recaptured several strongholds from the Swedes and a year later captured Wolmar on 19 December 1601 Fellin on 16 May 1602, and Bialy Kamien on 30 September 1602. The rigours of the campaign, however, placed a <b>strain</b> <b>on</b> his health, and he resigned the command.|$|E
5|$|In 1808, Napoleon and Czar Alexander {{met at the}} Congress of Erfurt to {{preserve}} the Russo-French alliance. The leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at Tilsit in 1807. By 1811, however, tensions had increased and Alexander was {{under pressure from the}} Russian nobility to break off the alliance. A major <b>strain</b> <b>on</b> {{the relationship between the two}} nations became the regular violations of the Continental System by the Russians, which led Napoleon to threaten Alexander with serious consequences if he formed an alliance with Britain.|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional {{stress and}} strain {{analysis}} considering the effect of <b>strain</b> rate <b>on</b> polyester under uniaxial tension and torsion was investigated by the scattered-light method. The difference in principal <b>strains</b> <b>on</b> the symmetrical section in tension problems could be calculated using two kinds of scattered fringe patterns obtained by two different incidences of polarized light. The shearing <b>strains</b> <b>on</b> the symmetrical section in torsion problems could be calculated using scattered fringe patterns obtained by one directional incidence. Finally, a new method was proposed for the estimation of the equivalent shearing {{stress and strain}}, the deviatoric stresses and <b>strains</b> <b>on</b> the symmetrical section in a three-dimensional model under uniaxial tension from the measurement of only the fringe gradient and its rate of increase. The method could estimate the equivalent shearing stress and strain in the model under torsion, too. This method was applied to a viscoelasto-plastic problem of a cylindrical specimen with a semi-circular notch under uniaxial tension and torsion. The distributions of strain rate, <b>strain</b> and stress <b>on</b> the notched section were estimated. The results were consistent with those calculated using the finite element method...|$|R

5|$|On 22 June 1941, Hitler {{launched}} Operation Barbarossa, {{the invasion}} of the Soviet Union.

40|$|A coating {{method for}} {{measuring}} large surface strains of three-dimensional bodies using the scattered-ligt technique was proposed {{associated with an}} investigation of photoviscoplastic bhavior of properly mixed polyester resin. A major advantage of this method is that interference fringes at the boundary between a real specimen and coatings can be observed directly. Two components of shearing <b>strains</b> <b>on</b> {{the surface of the}} real specimen in axi-symmetrical torsion problems could be calculated using two kinds of scattered-light fringe patterns obtained by two different incidences of polarized light. For the demonstration of effectiveness of the proposed method, this method was applied to analyses of surface strains of solid and circumferentially notched cylindrical specimens made of aluminum alloy with polyester coatings under torsion. Shearing <b>strains</b> <b>on</b> the surface of solid specimens were estimated, which were well consistent with ones calculated from twisting angles. For the notched specimen, shearing <b>strains</b> <b>on</b> the notch surface were estimated and the distributions were well consistent with FEM analyses...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the strain values from proximal to distal on the medial and lateral regions of Mc 3 diaphysis. Left Mc 3 256 mm length was used. Strain gages were located on the lateral and medial regions of the bone diaphysis. Diaphyseal length was 204 mm and strain gauges were spaced at 4 cm intervals.
