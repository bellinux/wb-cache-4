40|$|The method Baumann, or <b>sulphur</b> <b>print</b> {{as it is}} also known, is one of {{the tools}} used to {{evaluate}} the operating conditions of continuous casting machine and quality control of material produced. The internal defects analyzed in <b>sulphur</b> <b>print</b> are traditionally classified manually by comparing sample results with predefined patterns. This paper presents an alternative to the traditional classification of internal defects, making use of digital images of samples generated during Baumann method...|$|E
40|$|Effect of {{electro-magnetic}} stirring on {{soundness of}} continuously cast billets and slabs {{can be assessed}} by many methods like visual inspection of macro-etch & <b>sulphur</b> <b>print</b> evaluation. Ultrasonic assessment provides through thickness information of the test samples, whereas, macro-etching and <b>sulphur</b> <b>print</b> methods provide information in one plane only. An attempt {{has been made to}} evaluate the soundness (inhomogeneities / flaws as well as effect of columnar / equiaxed grains) of continuously cast low carbon and high carbon continuously cast billets by ultrasonic attenuation as well as high gain pulse-echo technique in transverse cut slices. One low carbon grade (Grade – LC) and one high carbon grades (Grade – HC) were selected for this purpose. Assessment of over all flaws / inhomogeneities was done by counting number of high gain internally reflected signals (flaw-echoes) using 6 MHz twin crystal probe. Using 10 MHz probe and attenuation technique (attenuation indicated by back-wall echo drop) was used to evaluate the overall macro-structure (including columnar / equiaxed grains as well as inhomogeneities / flaws). The result revealed no significant improvement in the equiaxed zone in case of low carbon grade billets (i. e. Grade – LC), whereas, there was significant improvement in the equiaxed zone of high carbon grade billets (Grade – HC). The ultrasonic flaws in the inclusion concentration bands in all the billets were found to decrease after electro-magnetic stirring. In low carbon billet, however, the flaws were found to increase in the central region after electro-magnetic stirring...|$|E
40|$|An {{application}} of the excimer laser {{in the area of}} material characterization making use of its ablative ability to perform surface <b>sulphur</b> <b>printing</b> is presented. It is shown that the differential ablative and surface melting capability of the excimer laser is useful in microetching sulphide inclusions in flat polished steel samples and rough fracture surfaces. An optimum laser fluence is found to be that which melts the sulphide particles without significant melting of the steel matrix or causing overlap of the characteristics halo formed by the out-flowing liquid from the sulphides. The geometric similarity of the sulphide inclusions is maintained and its spatial extent is amplified about 10 times. This brings sub-micron sulphide particles into optical resolution range. The liquid wetting behavior of the sulphide liquid is variable with Mn/Fe ratio and determines the extent of the halo formation...|$|R

Later, Kaale reassures the gang that the city won't need another as long as everything is under control.|$|R
