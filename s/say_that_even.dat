5|$|Isabeau was {{dismissed}} by historians as a wanton, weak and indecisive leader. Modern historians now {{see her as}} taking an unusually active leadership role for a queen of her period, forced to take responsibility {{as a direct result}} of Charles' illness. Her critics accepted skewed interpretations of her role in the negotiations with England, resulting in the Treaty of Troyes, and in the rumors of her marital infidelity with Orléans. Gibbons writes that a queen's duty was to secure the succession to the crown and look after her husband; historians described Isabeau as having failed in both respects, and she came to be seen as one of the great villains of history. Gibbons goes on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> her physical appearance is uncertain; depictions of her vary depending on whether she was to be portrayed as good or evil.|$|E

Communities where almost everyone is Christian are rare to find in Egypt outside of the Zabbaleen community of Mokattam. According to Engi Wassef, in her commentary in her documentary film Marina of the Zabbaleen, {{many people in the}} Zabbaleen village <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if they could live outside of the village or buy a house elsewhere, they would not because they are happy to live within their own religious community and freely practice their religion.|$|E
25|$|Fritz Perls {{presented}} {{his theory of}} dreams {{as part of the}} holistic nature of Gestalt therapy. Dreams are seen as projections of parts of the self that have been ignored, rejected, or suppressed. Jung argued that one could consider every person in the dream to represent an aspect of the dreamer, which he called the subjective approach to dreams. Perls expanded this point of view to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> inanimate objects in the dream may represent aspects of the dreamer. The dreamer may, therefore, be asked to imagine being an object in the dream and to describe it, in order to bring into awareness the characteristics of the object that correspond with the dreamer's personality.|$|E

25|$|David Hume {{acknowledged}} {{that there are}} events constantly unfolding, humanity cannot guarantee that these events are caused by events prior or if they are independent instances. Hume opposed the widely accepted theory of Causation that ‘all events have a specific course or reason.’ Therefore Hume crafted his own theory of causation, which he formed through his empiricist and skeptic beliefs. He split Causation, into two realms “All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally {{be divided into two}} kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact”. Relations of Ideas are a priori, and represent universal bonds between ideas that mark the cornerstones of human thought. Matters of Fact are dependent on the observer and experience. They are often not universally held to be true among multiple persons. Hume was an Empiricist, meaning he believed “causes and effects are discoverable not by reason, but by experience”. Hume later goes onto <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> with the perspective of the past, humanity cannot dictate future events because thoughts of the past are limited, compared to the possibilities for the future. Hume’s separation between Matters of Fact and Relations of Ideas {{is often referred to as}} “Hume’s Fork”.|$|E
500|$|In July 2009, Coulter {{released}} [...] "Don't Miss You", which {{peaked at}} number24, {{as the lead}} single from her proposed third studio album, Hear No, See No, Speak No. The second single, the title track, was released in October 2009, and peaked at number46. Hear No, See No, Speak No was originally scheduled {{to be released in}} November 2009, but was pushed back for a January 2010 release. Coulter eventually decided to cancel the album's release due to the first two singles struggling on the charts. In March2010, Coulter was a supporting act for Backstreet Boys' Australian leg of their This Is Us Tour. That same year, her song [...] "Can't Touch It" [...] was featured on the soundtrack to the film, Sex and the City 2. Coulter announced via her official Twitter account on 2 July 2010, that she had parted ways with her manager of five years Lauren Brown. It was then revealed that her new manager was Sean Anderson of the management company 22. Coulter later parted ways with Anderson and became managed by her-then boyfriend Richard Harrison of Black Label Entertainment. Throughout 2010, Coulter put her music career on hold as she took on a full-time position as a breakfast radio presenter for Sydney's Nova 96.9, alongside Merrick Watts and Scott Dooley. During this time, Coulter had thoughts about quitting music. [...] "At the start of [...] year, I couldn't imagine walking in a studio and writing a song again. I didn't even want to get on stage and sing. I was over it. It's hard for me to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> now. Music is all I've ever wanted to do. I wasn't mentally there any more. I wanted out, it was too hard. I felt like I'd been worn down. I felt defeated". She later stated that after attending a Thirty Seconds to Mars concert in Melbourne and rewatching Michael Jackson's [...] DVD, she was inspired to perform again.|$|E

[...] There are no details in Green {{on the politics of}} Ireland, only military capacity estimates. [...] Green makes no mention of the IRA in these estimates, and it is fair to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if the planners had wanted to include detail and estimates of the IRA they would not have gained much accurate information from the Abwehr.|$|E

2500|$|The ink {{used on the}} Gospel of Jesus's Wife papyrus {{fragment}} has {{now been}} analyzed more thoroughly and as of April 10, 2014 has been deemed by professors of electrical engineering, chemistry and biology at Columbia University, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to be [...] "more likely ancient than fake." [...] These scientists <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> using their various microscopic instruments it resembles other ancient papyri from the fourth to the eighth centuries.

It's an ancient papyrus with ancient ink, but it doesn't necessarily prove that Jesus had a wife or disciples who were women. Dr. Karen L. King, the historian at Harvard Divinity School who first presented the papyrus in Rome in 2012, has said its contents prove only that early Christians wrote about celibacy, sex, marriage and discipleship.|$|E
2500|$|The Conservative Party {{would have}} to, preferably {{at the next}} election, ask: [...] "Do you intend still to control the laws which you obey, the taxes you pay and the {{policies}} of your government?" [...] Five days after this speech, in an interview for The Daily Telegraph, Thatcher praised Powell: [...] "I have always read Enoch Powell's speeches and articles very carefully.... I always {{think it was a}} tragedy that he left. He is a very, very able politician. I <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though he has sometimes said vitriolic things against me". On the day of the Mid-Staffordshire by-election, Powell claimed that the government should admit that the community charge was [...] "a disaster" [...] and that what mattered most to the people of Mid-Staffordshire was the question of who should govern Britain and that only the Conservative Party was advocating that the British should govern themselves. Thatcher had been labelled [...] "dictatorial" [...] for wanting to [...] "go it alone" [...] in Europe: [...] "Well, I do not mind somebody being dictatorial in defending my own rights and those of my fellow countrymen... lose self-government, and I have lost everything, and for good". This was the first election since 1970 that Powell was advocating a vote for the Conservative Party. However, the Labour Party won the seat from the Conservative Party, mainly because of the community charge.|$|E

2500|$|A 1976 {{article in}} The New York Times {{described}} the campus as a [...] "cheerful, optimistic {{place where people}} smile a lot and tend to be considerate and trusting". In 1992 The New York Times reported that the university {{was a place where}} all students and faculty meditate, and all the Maharishi's teachings are woven into mathematics, physics and every other subject, similar to colleges with strong religious affiliations, while noting it is [...] "an accredited university with grant-winning faculty members and competitive students who mix transcendental meditation" [...] and through [...] "serious academics studies" [...] hope to create [...] "their own new world". [...] The article goes on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> as the university gains research grants and subsequent credibility, it also faces controversy. For example, one critic, 1979 alumnus Curtis Mailloux, called the campus a [...] "coercive environment" [...] with a [...] "propensity for fraudulent research". Accreditation officials say they are aware of these accusations and [...] "have been aggressive in checking Marahishi [...] International's academic freedom". The deputy director of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCACS), Steven D. Crow, says [...] "Every move the university's made has been monitored" [...] and MIU's library, faculty, academic mission and classroom space have been deemed appropriate. At the same time John W. Patterson, a professor at Iowa State University has harshly criticized The North Central Association's evaluation, saying it [...] "does nothing more than to lend credibility to these crackpots". The article also reports that many non-students have moved to the city of Fairfield [...] "so they can meditate in the [...] domes".|$|E
2500|$|While {{there is}} no mention of Buddha {{endorsing}} or repudiating vegetarianism in surviving portions of Pali Tripitaka and no Mahayana sutras explicitly declare that meat eating violates the first precept, certain Mahayana sutras vigorously and unreservedly denounce the eating of meat, mainly on the ground that such an act violates the bodhisattva's compassion. The sutras which inveigh against meat-eating include the Mahayana version of the Nirvana Sutra, the Shurangama Sutra, the Brahmajala Sutra, the Angulimaliya Sutra, the Mahamegha Sutra, and the Lankavatara Sutra, as well as the Buddha's comments on the negative karmic effects of meat consumption in the Karma Sutra. [...] In the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, which presents itself as the final elucidatory and definitive Mahayana teachings of the Buddha on the very eve of his death, the Buddha states that [...] "the eating of meat extinguishes the seed of Great Kindness", adding that all and every kind of meat and fish consumption (even of animals found already dead) is prohibited by him. He specifically rejects the idea that monks who go out begging and receive meat from a donor should eat it: [...] "[...] [...] it should be rejected [...] [...] [...] I <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> meat, fish, game, dried hooves and scraps of meat left over by others constitutes an infraction [...] [...] [...] I teach the harm arising from meat-eating." [...] The Buddha also predicts in this sutra that later monks will [...] "hold spurious writings to be the authentic Dharma" [...] and will concoct their own sutras and lyingly claim that the Buddha allows the eating of meat, whereas in fact he says he does not. A long passage in the Lankavatara Sutra shows the Buddha speaking out very forcefully against meat consumption and unequivocally in favor of vegetarianism, since the eating of the flesh of fellow sentient beings is said by him to be incompatible with the compassion that a Bodhisattva should strive to cultivate. In several other Mahayana scriptures, too (e.g., the Mahayana jatakas), the Buddha is seen clearly to indicate that meat-eating is undesirable and karmically unwholesome.|$|E
