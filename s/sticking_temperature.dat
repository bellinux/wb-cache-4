40|$|The {{sticking}} {{behavior of}} various mold materials and coatings for hot glass melt forming processes, like, e. g. glass container manufacturing, was investigated {{using a new}} testing procedure. The mold material specimens under test were subjected to frequent contact with hot viscous glass gobs in a pressing process with presetting well defined non-isothermal pressing parameters to simulate industrial working conditions. Three different glass compositions were used in this investigation, soda-lime silicate glass, lead crystal glass, and borosilicate glass. The sticking characteristics of the tested mold materials and coatings were described by two quantities, a »dasia« lower »psila« and an »dasia« upper »psila« <b>sticking</b> <b>temperature,</b> which are specific for each mold material and type of glass in the non-isothermal pressing process. The »dasia« lower »psila« sticking temperatures of uncoated mold materials were found to depend monotonically on the thermal effusivity (heat penetration coefficient) of the bulk mold materials. All of the coating materials applied to various substrate mold materials were found to reduce the »dasia« lower »psila« <b>sticking</b> <b>temperature</b> {{as compared to the}} uncoated materials.

40|$|A new {{testing method}} and {{apparatus}} for determining <b>sticking</b> <b>temperature</b> {{as well as}} hot corrosion and wear of mold materials {{to be used in}} glass industry has been developed. The testing procedure simulates the molding process in glass container manufacturing by pressing a large number of gobs (soda-lime glass) from a melting crucible under defined non-isothermal conditions. As function of pressing parameters, especially mold temperature, molding pressure and service time of the mold specimens, the sticking behavior, surface structure of the molded glass objects and corrosion and wear of the mold surfaces are analyzed. The intensity of sticking at each mold temperature underlies a statistical distribution, and is quantified by recording the time interval necessary for separating the glass blank from the mold surface using a well defined debonding procedure. The duration of sticking increases steeply with mold temperature within a narrow temperature interval of 20 - 50 K. The sticking characteristics of each tested material (stellite, cast iron, coated steel, bronze) can be described by two values: the lower and the upper sticking temperatures. A definition for each is given in the presented work. For the lower sticking temperatures a nearly linear dependence on the thermal diffusivity of the mold materials was found. The upper <b>sticking</b> <b>temperature</b> depends additionally on chemical and structural properties of the mold surfaces. Corrosion and wear of the mold materials are monitored by analyzing abraded particles on the molded glass surfaces and by stylometry. Due to carrying out these experiments at and above the lower <b>sticking</b> <b>temperature</b> (i. e. well above mold temperatures run in industrial processes), significant differences in corrosion behavior in short time laboratory experiments are obtained...|$|E

Cavity defects on the surface of an iron particle with different morphologies were examined by positron annihilation spectroscopy. The results indicated that cavity defects on the surface of an iron particle with an iron whisker were higher than with others, which resulted in an easier surface diffusion of Fe atoms. From the calculation of a critical solid bridge radius, the critical solid bridge radius lowered with the decreasing of gas velocity and particle size. And when an instantaneous solid bridge radius was bigger than a critical solid bridge radius, sticking of the iron particle happened. The iron whisker made the surface diffusion rate of Fe atoms occur more quickly, which resulted in a faster growth rate of the instantaneous solid bridge radius.

The intent was to identify materials that would minimize or eliminate adherence of glass on the bellows liner wall and help minimize possible pluggage during glass pouring operations in DWPF. Glass has been observed adhering to the current bellow`s liner, which is made of 304 L stainless steel. Materials were identified which successfully allowed molten glass to hit these surfaces and not adhere. Results {{of this study suggest}} that if these materials are used in the pouring system glass could still fall into the canister without appreciable plugging, even if an unstable glass stream is produced. The materials should next be evaluated under the most realistic DWPF conditions possible. Other findings of this study include the following: (1) increasing coupon thickness produced a favorable increase in the glass sticking temperature; (2) highly polished surfaces, with the exception of the oxygen-free copper coupon coated with Armoloy dense chromium, did not produce a significant improvement in the glass <b>sticking</b> <b>temperature,</b> increasing angle of contact of the coupon to the falling glass did not yield a significant performance improvement; (3) electroplating with gold and silver and various diffusion coatings did not produce a significant increase in the glass <b>sticking</b> <b>temperature.</b> However, they may provide added oxidation and corrosion resistance for copper and bronze liners.

40|$|For {{characterization}} {{and assessment}} of service behavior of mold materials and mold coatings for glass forming opterations, like e. g. glass container manufacturing, a testing procedure and corresponding laboratory apparatus was developed. The testing procedure resembles industrial working conditions, the mold material specimens are subjected to cyclic loading by pressing small gobs (soda-lime glass) from a melting crucible under defined non-isothermal conditions. A function of pressing parameters, especially mold temperature, molding pressure and service time of the mold specimens, the sticking behavior, surface structure of the molded glass objects and corrosion and wear of the mold surfaces are analyzed. The sturdiness of sticking may be described by a Gaussian distribution, and is quantified by recording the time interval necessary for separating the glass blank from the mold surface using a special separation procedure. The duration of sticking increases steeply with mold temperature within a narrow temperature interval of 20 - 50 K. The sticking characteristics of each tested bulk material and coating can be described by two material specific values: the lower and the upper sticking temperatures. The lower sticking temperatures exhibit a linear dependence on the thermal diffusivity of the mold materials, whereas the upper <b>sticking</b> <b>temperature</b> additionally depends on chemical and structural properties of the mold surfaces. Corrosion and wear of the mold materials in contact with hot glass is enhanced in this testing procedure due to conducting those pressing experiments well above the lower <b>sticking</b> <b>temperature,</b> which yields significant differences in corrosion behaviour in short time laboratory experiments...|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to previous studies a new coating strategy {{was developed to}} decouple the viscosity in the glass volume from the sticking behaviour at the glass surface. Not the mould, but the glassy substrate was coated with a thin, adhesive and ductile layer. For that purpose, soda-lime silica and borosilicate glasses were coated with gold, chromium, carbon, silica or titanium oxide. The isothermal hot embossing was carried out under air or, however, under argon atmosphere with a pressure of 500 Pa. Under vacuum inert gas atmosphere, all examined coatings shift the sticking temperatures by around 80 K to temperatures near the Littleton-temperature of the glass, which is even higher than the temperature process range of micro structuring. The adhesive forces are < 10 % in comparison to those observed at uncoated glass substrates. Under air, {{the increase in the}} <b>sticking</b> <b>temperature</b> is not as pronounced.

40|$|The {{sticking}} of haematite {{and iron}} powder during the fluidisation process was investigated using a visual fluidised bed reactor. The {{results showed that}} the amount of iron needed to stick decreased with increasing fluidisation temperature. Owing to no iron whisker formation in the experiments, the sticking phenomenon was discussed in the special case where iron morphology was dense or porous, and much attention should be paid to the effect of sintering of iron-iron contact on sticking, especially, surface nano-/microstructures of fresh iron that caused an increase in particle cohesiveness and sticking tendency. It was assumed that haematite covered with iron transformed into cohesive particles that self-agglomerated above minimum sintering temperature. Owing to the interface reaction induced, the <b>sticking</b> <b>temperature</b> of haematite was always lower than that of iron powder in the same size ranges. On the basis of sintering with surface diffusion mechanism, the tendency of sticking was enhanced by reduction reaction through reinforcing mass transfer on particle surface. Therefore, when iron whiskers were suppressed, sticking phenomenon was viewed as the agglomeration fluidisation among cohesive particles under sintering action...|$|E

The nearly exponential decrease of the sticking coefficient {{as a function of}} coverage by about five orders of magnitude is explained within a kinetic lattice gas model {{to be the result of}} strong nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor repulsions. The latter also shape the desorption spectra which are calculated within the same model under the assumption that fast surface diffusion maintains the adsorbate in quasiequilibrium during desorption. Because the desorption rate is proportional to the sticking coefficient under these conditions,we find a massive decrease of the pre-exponential factor in the Arrhenius parametrization of the rate as a function of coverage which explains the peculiar shape of the desorption spectra.

40|$|The {{most widely}} used process for {{dehydration}} of dairy products is spray drying. This is an effective method for preserving biological products as it does not involve severe heat treatment and allows storage of powders at ambient temperature. Various authors have reported the physicochemical properties of free and bound water {{and the effects of}} water on physical state, transition temperatures, <b>sticking</b> <b>temperature,</b> reaction kinetics and stability of milk products. The emphasis is on the physical state of non-fatty solids and the effects of water and its physical state on chemical reaction rates, growth of micro-organisms and stability.

The maximum moisture content of a dairy powder (4 % for skim milk powder) is defined in the product specification in relation to a(w), and this must be close to 0. 2 at 25 degrees C for optimal preservation.

A comprehensive theoretical model for predicting the flame spreading, combustion, and grain deformation phenomena of long, unslotted stick propellants is presented.

50|$|The {{physical}} properties of soils, {{in order of}} decreasing importance, are texture, structure, density, porosity, consistency, temperature, colour and resistivity. Soil texture {{is determined by the}} relative proportion of the three kinds of soil mineral particles, called soil separates: sand, silt, and clay. At the next larger scale, soil structures called peds are created from the soil separates when iron oxides, carbonates, clay, silica and humus, coat particles and cause them to adhere into larger, relatively stable secondary structures. Soil density, particularly bulk density, is a measure of soil compaction. Soil porosity consists of the void part of the soil volume and is occupied by gases or water. Soil consistency is the ability of soil to <b>stick</b> together. Soil <b>temperature</b> and colour are self-defining. Resistivity refers to the resistance to conduction of electric currents and affects the rate of corrosion of metal and concrete structures.

The catalysts were annealed single crystal Pd (110) surfaces and bimetallic Au/Pd (110) surfaces prepared by metal vapour deposition and annealing. All the molecules investigated adsorbed well to Pd (110) with a high sticking probability, and mechanisms for the reactions of each with the surface were suggested. The carbonaceous organic molecules all decomposed to deposit carbon at the surface at room temperature and above, blocking active sites to adsorption. Above a specific temperature, this carbon went subsurface and no longer inhibited subsequent adsorption of molecules. A residual carbon layer was often characterised by low energy electron diffraction and spectroscopy techniques, the exact structure varied with incident molecule type. The deposited carbon could often be removed in a facile manner by oxygen treatment. In the case of acetic acid, an acetate species was formed at room temperature and decomposed at higher temperatures with autocatalytic decomposition kinetics. Vinyl acetate reacted in a similar way to acetaldehyde under most conditions investigated, suggesting vinyl acetate decomposes primarily via a cleavage that produces acetyl groups under these conditions. An exceptional case occurred at 300 - 323 K at high coverages, where the formation of a template structure on the surface may stabilise acetate formation from vinyl-acetate cleavage. On Au/Pd (110) surfaces after annealing, the Au was determined to be partly subsurface in most cases. The uptake and sticking probability of each molecule were reduced often in a manner approximately proportional to Au content, in broad agreement with structural data on Au/Pd(110) published elsewhere...|$|R

The loading {{on the wall}} must remain sufficiently low to ensure that economic and safety constraints are met. One proposed method for decreasing {{the intensity of the}} wall loading is to fill the reaction chamber with a gas, such as Xe, at low density. The gas will absorb much of the radiation and ion energy from the fusion event, and then slowly release it to the chamber wall. Unfortunately the protective gas introduces major heat loads on the direct drive target. The thermal loading of a target, during injection, largely determines the viability of that target upon reaching chamber center. Thus, the density of the gas must be carefully selected to ensure that a target will survive injection. The objective of this work is to quantify and characterize the heat flux resulting from the interaction of the target and the protective gas. The loading of the target is modeled using DS 2 V, a commercial DSMC program.

This parameter plays {{a crucial role}} for the formation of ice precipitation and for electrification processes. The parameterization is intended to be used in atmospheric models simulating the aggregation of ice particles in glaciated clouds. It should improve the ability to forecast snow. Based on experimental results and general considerations of collision processes, dependencies of the <b>sticking</b> efficiency on <b>temperature,</b> surface area, and collision kinetic energy of impacting particles are derived. The parameters have been estimated from some laboratory observations by simulating the experiments and minimizing the squares of the errors of the prediction of observed quantities. The predictions from the new scheme are compared with other available laboratory and field observations. The comparisons show that the parameterization is able to reproduce the thermal behavior of sticking efficiency, observed in published laboratory studies, with a peak around - 15 degrees C corresponding to dendritic vapor growth of ice. Finally, a new theory of sticking efficiency is proposed. It explains the empirically derived parameterization in terms of a probability distribution of the work that would be required to separate two contacting particles colliding in all possible ways among many otherwise identical collisions of the same pair with a given initial collision kinetic energy. For each collision, if this work done would exceed the initial collision kinetic energy, then there is no separation after impact.

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{developing}} wet cohesive soils (especially at cold <b>temperatures)</b> <b>sticking</b> and freezing of soil on the operating elements essentially reduces the machines performance. The performance decrease happens due to the reduction in the useful capacity of the scoops and due to incomplete unloading, the growth of frontal resistance at cutting (digging) as a result of wet ground sticking to a working part and also the resistance of the input into the scoop and increase of machine downtime due to the need to clean the operating elements. One of the most effective ways to reduce the adhesion of soils at the temperatures below zero is effecting with thermal and vibrothermal intensifiers. The article presents the analysis of shovels performance and soil frictional resistance inside the scoop. The proportionality coefficient or reduced friction coefficient takes into account the shift peculiarities when determining the soil friction force on metal surface, and its value includes deformation and adhesive components and depends on the same parameters as the shear resistance, namely, the time and the contact pressure, humidity and dispersity of soil, temperature in the shear plane, the surface state of the metal. Experimentally {{with the use of a}} special bench shift values the proportionality factor was determined depending on the temperature in the shear plane without affecting intensifiers, which reduce adhesion, and also at thermoacoustic and thermal impact.
