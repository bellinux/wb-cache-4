25|$|A {{series of}} {{short-term}} positions followed, including three unproductive months with Professor Warren S. Johnson's American Wireless Telegraph Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and {{work as an}} assistant editor of the Western Electrician in Chicago. With radio research his main priority, de Forest next took a night teaching position at the Lewis Institute, which freed him to conduct experiments at the Armour Institute. By 1900, using a spark-coil transmitter and his responder receiver, de Forest expanded his transmitting range to about seven kilometers (four miles). Professor Clarence Freeman of the Armour Institute became interested in de Forest's work and developed {{a new type of}} <b>spark</b> <b>transmitter.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, White set {{in motion}} a series of highly visible {{promotions}} for American DeForest: [...] "Wireless Auto No.1" [...] was positioned on Wall Street to [...] "send stock quotes" [...] using an unmuffled <b>spark</b> <b>transmitter</b> to loudly draw the attention of potential investors, in early 1904 two stations were established at Wei-hai-Wei on the Chinese mainland and aboard the Chinese steamer SS Haimun, which allowed war correspondent Captain Lionel James of The Times of London to report on the brewing Russo-Japanese War, and later that year a tower, with [...] "DEFOREST" [...] arrayed in lights, was erected {{on the grounds of the}} Louisiana Purchase Exposition in Saint Louis, Missouri, where the company won a gold medal for its radiotelegraph demonstrations. (Marconi withdrew from the Exposition when he learned de Forest would be there).|$|E
2500|$|Fessenden was a {{significant}} figure {{in the development of}} AM radio. [...] He {{was one of the first}} researchers to realize, from experiments like the above, that the existing technology for producing radio waves, the <b>spark</b> <b>transmitter,</b> was not usable for amplitude modulation, and that a new kind of transmitter, one that produced sinusoidal continuous waves, was needed. [...] This was a radical idea at the time, because experts believed the impulsive spark was necessary to produce radio frequency waves, and Fessenden was ridiculed. [...] He invented and helped develop one of the first continuous wave transmitters - the Alexanderson alternator, with which he made what is considered the first AM public entertainment broadcast on Christmas Eve, 1906. [...] He also discovered the principle on which AM is based, heterodyning, and invented one of the first detectors able to rectify and receive AM, the electrolytic detector or [...] "liquid baretter", in 1902. [...] Other radio detectors invented for wireless telegraphy, such as the Fleming valve (1904) and the crystal detector (1906) also proved able to rectify AM signals, so the technological hurdle was generating AM waves; receiving them was not a problem.|$|E
5000|$|After WWI, greatly {{improved}} transmitters based on vacuum tubes became available, which overcame these problems, {{and by the}} late 1920s the only <b>spark</b> <b>transmitters</b> still in regular operation were [...] "legacy" [...] installations on naval vessels. Even when vacuum tube based transmitters had been installed, many vessels retained their crude but reliable <b>spark</b> <b>transmitters</b> as an emergency backup. However, by 1940, the technology was no longer used for communication. Use of the spark-gap transmitter led to many radio operators being nicknamed [...] "Sparks" [...] long after they ceased using <b>spark</b> <b>transmitters.</b> Even today, the German verb funken, literally, [...] "to spark", also means [...] "to send a radio message or signal".|$|R

25|$|Although {{there is}} some {{disagreement}} over the role Tesla himself played in the invention of radio, sources agree {{on the importance of}} his circuit in early radio transmitters. From a modern perspective, most <b>spark</b> <b>transmitters</b> could be regarded as Tesla coils.|$|R
50|$|Beginning around 1905 {{continuous}} wave (CW) transmitters began to replace <b>spark</b> <b>transmitters</b> for radiotelegraphy {{because they had}} much greater range. The first {{continuous wave}} transmitters were the Poulsen arc invented in 1904 and the Alexanderson alternator developed 1906-1910, which were replaced by vacuum tube transmitters beginning around 1920.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1896, Guglielmo Marconi {{produced}} a radiotelegraph system that used <b>spark</b> <b>transmitters,</b> which {{could only be}} used by trained operators, and was limited to Morse code transmissions.

2500|$|International Morse code {{today is}} most popular among amateur radio operators, {{in the mode}} {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "continuous wave" [...] or [...] "CW". (This name was chosen to distinguish it from the damped wave emissions from <b>spark</b> <b>transmitters,</b> not because the transmission is continuous.) Other keying methods are available in radio telegraphy, such as frequency shift keying.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} years of radio, from 1887 to 1917, <b>spark</b> gap <b>transmitters</b> {{generated}} radio waves by discharging a capacitance through an electric spark. [...] Each spark produced a transient pulse of radio waves which decreased rapidly to zero. [...] These damped waves could not be easily modulated to carry sound, as in modern AM and FM transmission. <b>Spark</b> <b>transmitters</b> could not transmit sound, and instead transmitted information by radiotelegraphy. The transmitter was switched on and off rapidly by the operator using a telegraph key, creating different length pulses of damped radio waves ("dots" [...] and [...] "dashes") to spell out text messages in Morse code.|$|R
50|$|Shoemaker {{proved to}} be a {{prolific}} worker, and received numerous patents for improvements in radio sending and receiving equipment. Most early <b>spark</b> <b>transmitters</b> were powered by batteries or Leyden jars. Shoemaker developed an improved design, which used 120-cycle alternating current, which provided more power for stronger signals, and also produced a distinctive sound that made it easier for a transmission to be heard on congested wavelengths.|$|R

50|$|Reginald Fessenden's first {{attempts}} to transmit voice employed a <b>spark</b> <b>transmitter</b> operating at approximately 10,000 sparks/second. To modulate this transmitter he inserted a carbon microphone {{in series with}} the supply lead. He experienced great difficulty in achieving intelligible sound. At least one high-powered audio transmitter used water cooling for the microphone.|$|E
50|$|When Reginald Fessenden {{contracted}} {{with the company}} for a steam turbine, Weagant applied for a job, and from 1908-1915 worked at Fessenden's National Electric Signaling Company's station at Brant Rock, Massachusetts, working {{on the design of}} the 100-kilowatt <b>spark</b> <b>transmitter</b> for the United States Navy's first high-power station at Arlington, Virginia.|$|E
50|$|Some early CW {{transmitters}} employed an arc converter {{that could}} not be conveniently keyed. Instead of turning the arc on and off, the key slightly changed the transmitter frequency in a technique known as the compensation-wave method. The compensation-wave was not used at the receiver. <b>Spark</b> <b>transmitters</b> used for this method consumed a lot of bandwidth and caused interference, so it was discouraged by 1921.|$|R
5000|$|Most operators, however, still {{preferred}} <b>spark</b> <b>transmitters</b> {{because of}} their uncomplicated design and because the carrier wave (carrier) stopped when the telegraph key was released, which let the operator [...] "listen through" [...] for a reply. With other types of transmitter, the carrier could not be controlled so easily, and they required elaborate measures to modulate the carrier and to prevent transmitter leakage from de-sensitizing the receiver.|$|R
5000|$|The Audion (triode) {{vacuum tube}} invented by Lee De Forest in 1906 {{was the first}} {{practical}} amplifying device and revolutionized radio. [...] Vacuum tube <b>transmitters</b> replaced <b>spark</b> <b>transmitters</b> and made possible four new types of modulation: continuous wave (CW) radiotelegraphy, amplitude modulation (AM) around 1915 which could carry audio (sound), frequency modulation (FM) around 1938 which had much improved audio quality, and single sideband (SSB).|$|R
5000|$|Another {{problem with}} the <b>spark</b> <b>transmitter</b> {{was a result of}} the shape of the {{waveform}} produced by each burst of electromagnetic radiation. These transmitters radiated an extremely [...] "dirty" [...] wide band signal that could greatly interfere with transmissions on nearby frequencies. Receiving sets relatively close to such a transmitter had entire sections of a band masked by this wide band noise.|$|E
50|$|In September 1915, Reynolds, then {{living in}} Minneapolis, Minnesota, was issued his first license, for an amateur radio station with the call sign 9WH. This initial station {{employed}} a <b>spark</b> <b>transmitter</b> {{that could only}} transmit the dots-and-dashes of Morse code. With {{the entrance of the}} United States into World War One in April 1917, all civilian radio stations were ordered to cease operations {{for the duration of the}} conflict.|$|E

[...] It radiated a beam of 66 cm waves with frequency of about 450 MHz. Receiver (right) is similar parabolic dipole antenna with micrometer spark gap.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{primitive}} radio transmitters (called Hertzian oscillators) {{were built}} by German physicist Heinrich Hertz in 1887 during his pioneering investigations of radio waves. These generated radio waves {{by a high}} voltage spark between two conductors. Beginning in 1895 Guglielmo Marconi developed the first practical radio communication systems using <b>spark</b> <b>transmitters.</b> They couldn't transmit audio (sound) and instead transmitted information by telegraphy, the operator tapping on a telegraph key which turned the transmitter on and off to produce pulses of radio waves spelling out text messages in Morse code. These spark-gap transmitters were used {{during the first three}} decades of radio (1887-1917), called the wireless telegraphy or [...] "spark" [...] era. Because they generated damped waves, <b>spark</b> <b>transmitters</b> were electrically [...] "noisy"; their energy was spread over a broad band of frequencies, creating radio noise which interfered with other transmitters. Two short-lived competing transmitter technologies came into use {{after the turn of the}} century, which were the first continuous wave transmitters: the Alexanderson alternator and Poulsen arc transmitters, which were used into the 1920s.|$|R

25|$|Although their damping {{had been}} reduced as much as possible, <b>spark</b> <b>transmitters</b> still {{produced}} damped waves which had a wide bandwidth, creating interference with other transmitters. Around 1920 they became obsolete, superseded by vacuum tube transmitters which generated continuous waves at a single frequency, which could also be modulated to carry sound. Tesla's resonant transformer continued {{to be used in}} vacuum tube transmitters and receivers, and is a key component in radio to this day.|$|R
