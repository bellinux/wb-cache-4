LGBT homeless youth experience limited access to emergency housing options that affirm their sexual orientation and/or gender identity, and according to a Note for the Family Court Review recommending policies regarding such housing options, as many as fifty percent of LGBT youth in emergency housing programs may be physically assaulted, a proportion further exacerbated at large shelters that house two hundred or more youth. In addition, homeless youth emergency housing programs may lead to the denial of services to LGBT youth under the religious aspects of this orientation of the individuals.|$|E
25|$|Poppy {{seeds are}} a common and flavorsome topping for breads and cakes. One gram of poppy seeds {{contains}} up to 33 micrograms of morphine and 14 micrograms of codeine, and the <b>Substance</b> <b>Abuse</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mental</b> Health Services Administration in the United States formerly mandated that all drug screening laboratories use a standard cutoff of 300 nanograms per milliliter in urine samples. A single poppy seed roll (0.76grams of seeds) usually did not produce a positive drug test, but a positive result was observed from eating two rolls. A slice of poppy seed cake containing nearly five grams of seeds per slice produced positive results for 24 hours. Such results are viewed as false positive indications of drug use and were {{the basis of a}} legal defense. On November 30, 1998, the standard cutoff was increased to 2000 nanograms (two micrograms) per milliliter. Confirmation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry will distinguish amongst opium and variants including poppy seeds, heroin, and morphine and codeine pharmaceuticals by measuring the morphine:codeine ratio and looking for the presence of noscapine and acetylcodeine, the latter of which is only found in illicitly produced heroin, and heroin metabolites such as 6-monoacetylmorphine.|$|E

In sum, this research highlights the importance of victimization, the social environment, and the process of identity change as key factors in the creation of health disparities by sexual orientation. Additionally, this work highlights the need for more health prevention efforts to target both-sex oriented persons and female sexual minority populations.

Finns det positiva aspekter i substansanvändning och hur en psykisk ohälsa kan förändra personens existens? Vad känner de människorna som lider så mycket att de ofta inte själva kan beskriva eller sätta ord på sina känslor? Ett upplevt lidande följer en människa livet ut. Människan är i grunden sårbar och beroende av andra. En dyrköpt men värdefull erfarenhet följer i försoningens spår efter genomgånget lidande. Syfte: Att sammanställa känslomässiga upplevelser hos personer med substansbrukssyndrom och psykisk ohälsa. Metod: Studien är utförd som en litteraturöversikt av kvalitativ forskning. De vetenskapliga studierna beskrev upplevelser hos vuxna män och kvinnor i åldern från 18 år. Substansbruk omfattade narkotika och alkohol. Resultat: Resultat baseras på 18 vetenskapliga studier om upplevelser av att leva med substansbrukssyndrom och psykisk ohälsa. Det presenteras två huvudkategorier och 14 subkategorier. Den lidande kvinnan: Våld under barndomen och i vuxen ålder; Partnerskap och lidande; Att vara mamma med substansbrukssyndrom; Hemlöshet och lidande; Kvinnans hopp om en bättre framtid; Rehabilitering och stöd; Alkohol i kvinnornas värld; Vårdpersonalens syn på kvinnans komplexa behov.

Are there positive aspects of substance use <b>and</b> how <b>mental</b> illness can change the person's existence? What do the people feel that go through so much suffering that they often cannot describe or express their feelings themselves? A person who experiences suffering follows the person all through life. Man is basically vulnerable and dependant. A hard fought but valuable experience follows {{in the path of}} reconciliation after going through suffering Purpose: To compile emotional experiences in people with <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> syndrome <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> illness. Method: The study is done as a literature review of qualitative research. The scientific studies described experiences of adult men and women aged 18 years and over. The uses of substances include drugs and alcohol. Result: The result is based on 18 scientific studies about experiences from living with <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> syndrome <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> illness. Two main categories and 14 subcategories are presented. The suffering woman: Violence during childhood and adulthood; Partnership and suffering; Being a mother with <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> syndrome; Homelessness <b>and</b> suffering; Women's hope for a better future; Rehabilitation and support; Alcohol in the world of women.; Healthcare staff's view of the complex needs of women. Male perception <b>and</b> experiences of <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> syndrome: A difficult childhood and the emergence of substance addiction; Attempts to end substance dependence; A self-destructive life; No place in society; Suffering during hospitalization; Alcohol in the world of men. Conclusion: The collected material was filled with mostly difficult experiences and should be taken into consideration by healthcare professionals in the care of people who have both <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> syndrome <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> illness. ...|$|R

These inherent thoughts are influenced from early adolescent experiences primarily a negative impact from culture.
