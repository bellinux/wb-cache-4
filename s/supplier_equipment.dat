30|$|Efficient overlay of {{more than}} one {{encryption}} system within a single bitstream can be very desirable. In a scheme where a TV broadcaster using an encryption system that is proprietary of one supplier wants to introduce new encryption systems of new independent suppliers, he would like to optimize bandwidth use by avoiding duplicating every channel on the network. Selective encryption could be very helpful; {{only a small fraction of}} the channel is duplicated (the part that will be encrypted). Each duplicated part will go through one <b>supplier</b> <b>equipment</b> and be encrypted by its encryption system. The remaining part (the shared one) will be sent once in the network and in the clear. Sony's Passage system proposed for the US cable market is a concrete example of this application [9]. This solution is particularly desirable when the suppliers are not willing to agree on a shared scrambling solution as done in DVB Simulcrypt [10].|$|E
40|$|Background: Malaria is an {{infectious}} disease {{that is still}} a health problem in Indonesia, which can cause death, especially in high-risk groups such as infants, toddlers, pregnant women and can directly lead to anemia and decreased work productivity. South Ogan Komering Ulu District {{was one of the}} endemic areas in South Sumatera Province. In a previous study in the District South Ogan Komering Ulu County Superior Data AMI found that high and low knowledge society related to malaria and most of respondents have not received counseling. Objective: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the needs of health care providers in malaria control programs. Methods: Data collected through in-depth interviews.  Informant interviews are two people responsible for malaria at the health department, the head of health centers and two people responsible for malaria in health centers. Results: The results showed that the needs required by the health care providers to improve health care services, especially malaria is a need for laboratory equipment (microscope, reagents, and rapid diagnostic test), the need for microscopic power, the need for malaria drugs that are still effective, procurement of mosquito nets, education malaria to the community, and training needs for existing microscopic officer. Conclusion: The need of health care providers is the fulfillment of the malaria supplies equipment, laboratory personnel and training that support the ability of health care providers. With the fulfillment of the provider of health services to the community are expected to be performing well. Recommendation: Budget is needed to support <b>supplier</b> <b>equipment</b> & training...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the issue}} of cost and benefit, the {{investment}} demand and consumption demand of micro-grids are insufficient in the early stages, which makes all parties lack motivation to participate in the development of micro-grid projects and leads to the slow development of micro-grids. In order to promote the development of micro-grids, the corresponding incentive mechanism should be designed to motivate the development of micro-grid projects. Therefore, this paper builds a multi-stage incentive model of micro-grid project development involving government, grid corporation, energy <b>supplier,</b> <b>equipment</b> supplier, and the user in order to study the incentive problems of micro-grid project development. Through the solution and analysis of the model, this paper deduces the optimal subsidy of government and the optimal cooperation incentive of the energy supplier, and calculates the optimal pricing strategy of grid corporation and the energy supplier, and analyzes the influence of relevant factors on optimal subsidy and incentive. The study reveals that the cost and social benefit of micro-grid development {{have a positive impact on}} micro-grid subsidy, technical level and equipment quality of equipment supplier as well as the fact that government subsidies positively adjust the level of cooperation incentives and price incentives. In the end, the validity of the model is verified by numerical analysis, and the incentive strategy of each participant is analyzed. The research of this paper is of great significance to encourage project development of micro-grids and to promote the sustainable development of micro-grids...|$|E
