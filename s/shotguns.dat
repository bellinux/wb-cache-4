40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{management}} and outcome of 138 abdominal <b>shotgun</b> wounds were examined over a 5 -year period. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: It {{has been proposed}} that exploratory laparotomy may be unnecessary and even overused in a subset of patients with abdominal <b>shotgun</b> wounds. METHODS: Data on <b>shotgun</b> wound patients from October 1987 through March 1992 from a statewide trauma registry were examined. Patients with abdominal <b>shotgun</b> wounds were identified and compared with patients with nonabdominal <b>shotgun</b> wounds. RESULTS: Of 516 <b>shotgun</b> wound patients, 138 (26. 7 %) had abdominal wounds and 88 (63. 8 %) had exploratory laparotomies. Abdominal <b>shotgun</b> wounds resulted in significantly longer number of intensive care unit days (4. 3 vs. 2. 5, p < 0. 05), {{a greater number of}} blood units transfused (7. 8 vs. 2. 4, p < 0. 05), and a higher mortality (15. 9 % vs. 4. 8 %, p < 0. 05) when compared with nonabdominal <b>shotgun</b> wounds. When stratified for trauma score, the mortality for abdominal <b>shotgun</b> wounds always was significantly greater than for nonabdominal <b>shotgun</b> wounds. All abdominal <b>shotgun</b> wound patients with trauma scores less than ten died. The negative laparotomy rate for abdominal <b>shotgun</b> wound patients with normal trauma scores was 9. 4 %. No patient with a negative laparotomy died. CONCLUSION: Abdominal <b>shotgun</b> wounds are a particularly lethal subset of <b>shotgun</b> wounds. Although some abdominal <b>shotgun</b> wound patients can be managed without laparotomy, the morbidity and mortality for these injuries are substantial, even in patients with normal trauma score. Clinical judgment is an excellent predictor of the need for laparotomy...|$|R

5000|$|The bore {{designation}} of the [...]410 bore is unique among <b>shotgun</b> cartridges. Other <b>shotgun</b> cartridges are {{measured in terms}} of <b>shotgun</b> gauge. <b>Shotgun</b> gauge is determined by the weight of a round lead ball that is sized to fit into its barrel. For example, the barrel of a 12-gauge <b>shotgun</b> is equal to the diameter of a 1/12th pound lead ball and a 20-gauge can fit a 1/20th pound ball. Using this method a [...]410 bore is equivalent to a (hypothetical) 67-gauge (see <b>Shotgun</b> gauge).|$|R
