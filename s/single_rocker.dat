50|$|Dodge's Hemi was {{introduced}} in 1953 as the Red Ram. Dodge {{did not have a}} V8 engine until one was developed specifically for the line in 1953 based on the 1951 Chrysler hemi design, but down-sized for these smaller cars. They have the smallest bore center distance of any hemi engine at 4.1875 in. They do not share any major dimensions or components with the larger Chrysler and DeSoto hemi engines, or the Plymouth A engines. From 1955 to 1958 lower performance versions of the Dodge hemi were introduced by substituting less complex poly (<b>single</b> <b>rocker</b> shaft) heads and valve train parts, including one variant only built as a poly (259"). These were used in low-line 1955-58 DeSotos and Dodges, and 1955-56 high-line Plymouths.|$|E

50|$|The Le Rhône engines used an {{unconventional}} valve actuation system, with a <b>single</b> centrally-pivoting <b>rocker</b> arm moving the exhaust valve and the intake valve. When the arm moved down it opened the intake valve {{and when it}} moved up it opened the exhaust value. To make this system work a two-way push-pull rod was fitted, instead of the more conventional one-way pushrod. This feature required the cam followers to incorporate a positive action, a function designed in by {{using a combination of}} links and levers. This design prevented valve overlap and so limited power output, but as the engine structure and cooling arrangements would not have been adequate at a higher power output this should not be considered a significant design fault.|$|R

Unlike Billy Fury or Marty Wilde, Kidd does not sing in an imitation voice of Elvis Presley or one of his American contemporaries. The song also bears a smooth harmony and contains no clear references to the rockabilly style.|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} contact {{is an important}} phenomenon that should be given into consideration to achieve better performance and long term reliability {{for the design of}} devices. Based upon this importance, the {{electrical contact}} interface has been visualized as a ‘‘ 3 D Contact Map’’ and used in order to investigate the contact asperities. The contact asperities describe the structures above and below the contact spots (the contact spots define the 3 D contact map) to the two conductors which make the contact system. The contact asperities require the discretization of the 3 D microstructures of the contact system into voxels. A contact analysis approach has been developed and introduced in this paper which shows the way to the 3 D visualization of the contact asperities of a given contact system. For the discretization of 3 D microstructure of contact system into voxels, X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) method is used in order to collect the data of a 250 V, 16 A rated AC <b>single</b> pole <b>rocker</b> switch which is used as a contact system for investigation...|$|R

The song suggests that by [...] "doing the bird", one can overcome their troubles. [...] "The Bird" [...] is a funk-rock offering, using both a drum machine and live drumming by Jellybean Johnson. Guitar takes the background for a funk effect, while keyboards play a dominant role in the song. After the main lyrics, there is an extended instrumental section to allow the band to dance. A [...] "Dance Remix" [...] of the song was released as a 12" [...] single. The B-side to the <b>single</b> was the <b>rocker,</b> [...] "My Drawers".|$|R
50|$|A {{multi-valve}} engine design typically has three, four, or five valves per cylinder to achieve improved performance. Any four-stroke {{internal combustion engine}} needs at least two valves per cylinder: one for intake of air and fuel, and another for exhaust of combustion gases. Adding more valves increases valve area and improves the flow of intake and exhaust gases, thereby enhancing combustion, volumetric efficiency, and power output. Multi-valve geometry allows the spark plug to be ideally located within the combustion chamber for optimal flame propagation. Multi-valve engines tend to have smaller valves that have lower reciprocating mass, which can reduce wear on each cam lobe, and allow more power from higher RPM without the danger of valve bounce. Some engines are designed to open each intake valve at a slightly different time, which increases turbulence, improving the mixing of air and fuel at low engine speeds. More valves also provide additional cooling to the cylinder head. The disadvantages of {{multi-valve engine}}s are an increase in manufacturing cost and a potential increase in oil consumption due to the greater number of valve stem seals. Some SOHC multi-valve engines (such as the Mazda B8-ME) use a <b>single</b> fork-shaped <b>rocker</b> arm to drive two valves (generally the exhaust valves) so that fewer cam lobes will be {{needed in order to}} reduce manufacturing costs.|$|R
50|$|After two propitious opening years, with {{a hectic}} touring {{schedule}} and several record releases increasingly impacting the charts, {{the release of}} the Valley of the Dolls long-player at the start of 1979, although being marked simultaneously by their highest chart hit with the <b>single</b> King <b>Rocker</b> achieving #11 in the U.K. Singles Chart, initiated the beginning of a deterioration in the success of the band's commercial output, and differences began to surface within it between Andrews and Billy Idol and the bass player Tony James as to its future musical direction. The disagreement about direction was augmented by Idol and James' refusal to allow Andrews to contribute to their song-writing partnership, and an increasing personal antipathy that had developed between Andrews and Idol. In May 1979 Andrews warned them that he was increasingly feeling like leaving Generation X, which was avoided by focusing on the band's first international tour in Japan mid-year, but on returning to England, during the recording sessions for the band's abortive third long-player (which would be released retrospectively 20 years later under the title Sweet Revenge) internal disputes came to a head, and Andrews quit the band just before Christmas. He would be joined by the band's drummer Mark Laff a month later, who Idol and James asked to leave over another disagreement.|$|R

50|$|Founded in 1999 {{while still}} in {{secondary}} school by guitarists Stephen Barry and Graham Lynch, drummer Johnny Lynch and bassist Mark Power, the group originally went under the name Wretch, in homage to Palm Desert rockers Kyuss, a band whom the four-piece were greatly influenced by.Early Wretch shows saw the group cover many Kyuss songs along with material by Alice in Chains, Orange Goblin, Black Sabbath and System of a Down. The group’s original material during this time also reflected their collective interest in stoner rock, and unlike their current incarnation, also featured vocals, provided by guitarist Stephen Barry.As the group continued to write more original material the direction their sound was taking moved away from its stoner rock roots towards a more expansive post-rock influence. The group decided to drop the vocals and focus solely on creating instrumental music. A demo, There's No Harm In Harmony, was the first indication of this new direction and was followed by some extensive gigging around Ireland, including shows with El Guapo, Giddy Motors and The Redneck Manifesto. The group also had their first official release in 2003 on Out On A Limb Records, a split Christmas <b>single</b> with Limerick <b>rockers</b> Giveamanakick.
