5|$|Jon Favreau, the writer, {{director}} and star of Chef, wrote the film's script {{in about two}} weeks. He had long {{wanted to make a}} film about food and chefs, and felt that the subject was <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small-scale independent film rather than a big-budget production. He cited Jiro Dreams of Sushi, Eat Drink Man Woman and Big Night as inspirations for creating a food-centric film.|$|E
5|$|As the Brookwood {{site had}} been {{intentionally}} chosen for its distance from London, {{at the time}} of its opening the only practical way to reach the cemetery was by railway. William Cubitt decided that the terrain of the initial cemetery site was best <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> railway branch from the LSWR at the west of the cemetery, and work began on the earthworks and rails for the new branch in early September 1854. The single-track branch was completed in time for the opening two months later. The junction with the LSWR, known as Necropolis Junction, was west-facing, meaning that trains to and from London were obliged to reverse in and out of the branch to the two stations in the cemetery. The poor quality gravel soil, which had been the initial reason for the site's cheapness and its selection as the site for the cemetery, was poorly suited as a railway trackbed. The rails, and in particular the sleepers, deteriorated rapidly and needed constantly to be replaced.|$|E
5|$|Each title {{focuses on}} the {{extraordinary}} invading the ordinary world, though the two main Megami Tensei series focus on different things: Shin Megami Tensei focuses more on the main protagonist gaining the power needed {{to survive in a}} world ruled over by tyrannical deities, while Persona focuses on interpersonal relationships and the psychology of a group of people. That protagonist is generally male within the Shin Megami Tensei titles: while a female lead or the ability to choose a lead's gender is not out of the question, some staff feel that Shin Megami Tensei lead roles are better <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> male character. Throughout its lifetime, the series has incorporated elements of Gnosticism, various world mythologies and religions including Christianity and Buddhism, early science fiction, Jungian psychology and archetypes, occultism, punk, and cyberpunk. The science fiction and fantasy elements are brought together and unified through the use of philosophical concepts, enabling a blending of concepts and aesthetics that might normally clash.|$|E

5|$|He {{then did}} a ten-month {{residency}} at Melbourne Hospital to gain experience {{before going into}} practice. The new graduates spent four months in the medicine ward, another four in surgery, and the remaining two in casualty. In the surgery ward he worked under John Gordon and Alan Newton, both well known surgeons. He enjoyed this period immensely and was disappointed {{when he had to}} do his medicine residency. However, he was soon engrossed in his work, having been inspired by the neurologist Richard Stawell, whom Burnet came to idolise. As a result of this he became intent on a career in clinical neurology, and he wrote a theoretical paper about testing sensory losses following peripheral nerve lesions, but his submission to the Clinical Report of the Melbourne Hospital was rejected. Burnet applied to be medical registrar as part of his clinical career path, but the medical superintendent of Melbourne Hospital, {{who was in charge of}} such appointments, deemed Burnet's character and personality more <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> laboratory research career, and asked Burnet to withdraw his application in return for the post of senior resident pathologist, which would become vacant in the following months. Burnet complied.|$|E
5|$|It {{quickly became}} evident that, {{contrary}} to some rumors, Norton {{had died in}} complete poverty. Five or six dollars in small change had been found on his person, and a search of his room at the boarding house on Commercial Street turned up a single gold sovereign, then worth around $2.50; his collection of walking sticks; his rather battered saber; a variety of headgear (including a stovepipe, a derby, a red-laced Army cap, and another cap <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> martial band-master); an 1828 French franc; {{and a handful of}} the Imperial bonds he sold to tourists at a fictitious 7% interest. There were fake telegrams purporting to be from Emperor Alexander II of Russia, congratulating Norton on his forthcoming marriage to Queen Victoria, and from the President of France, predicting that such a union would be disastrous to world peace. Also found were his letters to Queen Victoria and 98 shares of stock in a defunct gold mine.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of the British I Corps in 1914 was Douglas Haig. French had remarked in 1912 that Haig would be better <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> position on the staff than a field command. Like French, Haig was a cavalryman. His last active command had been during the Second Boer War, first as a senior staff officer in the cavalry division, then commanding a brigade-sized group of columns. The first {{commander of}} the British II Corps was Lieutenant General James Grierson, a noted tactician who {{died of a heart}} attack soon after arriving in France. French wished to appoint Lieutenant General Herbert Plumer in his place, but against French's wishes, Kitchener instead appointed Lieutenant General Horace Smith-Dorrien, who had begun his military career in the Zulu War in 1879 and was one of only five officers to survive the battle of Isandlwana. He had built a formidable reputation as an infantry commander during the Sudan Campaign and the Second Boer War. After the Second Boer War, he was responsible for a number of reforms, notably forcing an increase in dismounted training for the cavalry. This was met with hostility by French (as a cavalryman). By 1914, French's dislike for Smith-Dorrien was well known within the army.|$|E

40|$|Is collaborating on-line more {{productive}} than collaborating face-to-face? This {{case study is}} {{an exploration of the}} effectiveness of face-to-face and computer supported collaboration. More specifically learner attitudes towards the use of on-line and on-site collaborative learning within an undergraduate course on integrating technology into the classroom at Concordia University are explored. Learner reflections kept throughout the semester is analyzed to determine whether certain elements of collaboration, namely (a) efficiency, (b) group management, and (c) task process, are {{more productive}} within an on-line or on-site collaborative learning environment. Findings suggest that learners do perceive that some elements of collaboration are best <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> on-line learning environment while other elements are best <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> on-site learning environment...|$|R
5000|$|When {{considering}} a solo, the initial lead {{is a big}} advantage. Trump solos require a much stronger hand than you think ... these hands will also play well in a normal game.

5|$|Their {{high energy}} and drive make these dogs ideally <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> number of {{different}} dog sports such as flyball or agility. Obedience classes are also recommended to potential owners, as Jack Russells can be stubborn at times and aggressive towards other animals and humans if not properly socialized. Despite their small size, these dogs are not recommended for the condominium or apartment dweller unless the owner is {{ready to take on}} the daunting task of providing the dog with the necessary amount of exercise and stimulation. They have a tremendous amount of energy for their size, a fact which can sometimes lead to trouble involving larger animals. They may seem never to tire and will still be energetic after their owner has called it a day. While socialised members of the breed are friendly towards children, they will not tolerate abuse even if it is unintentional.|$|E
25|$|Bright {{began the}} tour well with 5–42 against Northern Districts. He was 12th {{man for the}} first test as Border felt the pitch was more <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> seamer. He played the second test making 0–51. His batting was useful helping Australia escape with a draw.|$|E

25|$|Water {{temperature}} {{determines the}} two most basic aquarium classifications: tropical versus cold water. Most fish and plant species tolerate only a limited temperature range; tropical aquaria, with an average temperature of about , are much more common. Cold water aquaria are for fish that are better <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cooler environment. More important than the range is consistency; most organisms are not accustomed to sudden changes in temperatures, which can cause shock and lead to disease. Water temperature can be regulated with a thermostat and heater (or cooler).|$|E

25|$|While {{maintaining}} historic ties {{to local}} agriculture, {{administration officials have}} also emphasized the desire to better connect with the local community. Currently, CSU is party to UniverCity, a multi-organization initiative that links the school with city government, community and business associations to expand and synchronize working relationships. Another goal set by the university is to improve undergraduate education. Essential tasks, according to Penley, are access and graduation rates, particularly for qualified low-income and minority students, and an education international in scope <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> global economy.|$|E
25|$|The {{species is}} little known in cultivation. It germinates well, but is {{difficult}} to establish and slow to grow. It has been grown successfully in loamy soil in northern Victoria, but attempts to grow it in the sandy soils of Perth have failed. Tony Cavanagh and Margaret Pieroni suggest that as a compact shrub with attractive foliage {{it would be best}} <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small garden. It requires warm, dry weather with near full sun, and heavy well drained soils. It is hardy to drought and frost.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{the chapel}} {{was not to}} be 'hidden' away in the centre of the estate, even as the trees lining its {{approach}} matured. Collison and Hosking sought a prominent and unapologetic landmark that would be seen from a good distance beyond the cemetery well into the future. To achieve this, whilst only being slowly revealed on its approach from the main entrance, considerable height was required. William Hosking considered this to be best <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> steeple – it would need to be much higher than any other in the vicinity, surpassing that of the local parish church, to produce maximum effect.|$|E

25|$|In November 1953, Time {{magazine}} published evidence gathered variously by Kenneth Page Oakley, Sir Wilfrid Edward Le Gros Clark and Joseph Weiner {{proving that}} the Piltdown Man was a forgery and demonstrating that the fossil was {{a composite of}} three distinct species. It consisted of a human skull of medieval age, the 500-year-old lower jaw of an orangutan and chimpanzee fossil teeth. Someone had created the appearance of age by staining the bones with an iron solution and chromic acid. Microscopic examination revealed file-marks on the teeth, and it was deduced from this that someone had modified the teeth to a shape more <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> human diet.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, Charles Richard Fairey, {{founder and}} chief {{designer}} of Fairey Aviation, disappointed with his Fawn bomber, which {{owing to the}} constraints of Air Ministry specifications, was slower than the Airco DH.9A which {{it was meant to}} replace while carrying no greater bombload, conceived the idea of a private venture bomber not subject to official limitations, which could demonstrate superior performance and handling. On seeing the Curtiss CR, powered by a Curtiss D-12 V-12 liquid-cooled engine of low frontal area and in a low drag installation, win the 1923 Schneider Trophy race, Fairey realised that this engine would be well <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new bomber and acquired an example of the engine and a licence for production.|$|E
25|$|Fast tissues absorb gas {{relatively}} quickly, {{but will}} generally release it quickly during ascent. A fast tissue may become saturated {{in the course}} of a normal sports dive, while a slow tissue may have absorbed only a small part of its potential gas capacity. By calculating the levels in each compartment separately, researchers are able to construct more effective algorithms. In addition, each compartment may be able to tolerate more or less supersaturation than others. The final form is a complicated model, but one that allows for the construction of algorithms and tables <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wide variety of diving. A typical dive computer has an 8–12 tissue model, with half times varying from 5 minutes to 400 minutes. The Bühlmann tables use an algorithm with 16 tissues, with half times varying from 4 minutes to 640 minutes.|$|E
