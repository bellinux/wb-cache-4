5|$|Cranmer's {{first contact}} with a Continental {{reformer}} was with Simon Grynaeus, a humanist based in Basel, Switzerland, and a follower of the Swiss reformers, Huldrych Zwingli and Johannes Oecolampadius. In the summer of 1531, Grynaeus took an extended visit to England to offer himself as an intermediary between the king and the Continental reformers. He <b>struck</b> <b>up</b> a friendship with Cranmer and after his return to Basel, he wrote about Cranmer to the German reformer Martin Bucer in Strasbourg. Grynaeus' early contacts initiated Cranmer's eventual relationship with the Strasbourg and Swiss reformers.|$|E

The two of them started a relationship and became lovers. In 1919 both Barrett and Wylie travelled to the United States, where they bought a car and spent over a year travelling the country. They stayed in New York and San Francisco and were recorded in the 1920 census as living in Carmel-By-The-Sea in California, where Wylie is classed {{as the head of}} the household and Barrett her friend.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 Muller {{travelled}} to South Africa, {{where he}} visited Cape Town, the Orange Free State, and the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek. In Pretoria {{he attended the}} inauguration of President Kruger and in Bloemfontein he <b>struck</b> <b>up</b> a friendship with the newly elected President M.T. Steyn and his family. He also renewed his relations with other leading statesmen, like former President F.W. Reitz, government secretary P.J. Blignaut, {{and chairman of the}} Volksraad C.H. Wessels. In Cape Town, he was granted an audience with High Commissioner Sir Alfred Milner.|$|E
5|$|Shingouz {{have a high}} alcohol {{tolerance}} and preference for strong alcoholic beverages, which they consume in large quantities. The Shingouz society is capitalist to the extreme. Shingouz want a profit from everything they do. They are especially adept in trading important and sensitive information to interested parties. Valérian and Laureline have <b>struck</b> <b>up</b> {{a relationship with a}} group of three Shingouz who have a particularly useful network of contacts in all the major space communities. They are especially fond of Laureline, which she often uses to her advantage in striking favourable deals with them.|$|E

5|$|After being {{assigned}} to cover Roosevelt during her husband's first presidential campaign, Hickok <b>struck</b> <b>up</b> {{a close relationship}} with the soon-to-be First Lady. For several years, the two corresponded almost every day, traveled together, and professed emotional and physical affection for one another. The exact nature of this relationship has been widely discussed by historians; some have argued that the relationship was clearly romantic or erotic, while others have argued that historians have been misled by Roosevelt's exuberant letters. It is known, and was known in the White House press corps at the time, that Hickok was a lesbian. More than 3,000 letters from the pair's correspondence are preserved at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.|$|E
5|$|As he revised {{his older}} works for Putnam, Irving {{continued}} to write regularly, publishing biographies {{of the writer}} and poet Oliver Goldsmith in 1849 and the 1850 work about the Islamic prophet Muhammad. In 1855, he produced Wolfert's Roost, a collection of stories and essays he had originally written for The Knickerbocker and other publications, and began publishing at intervals a biography of his namesake, George Washington, a work which he expected to be his masterpiece. Five volumes of the biography were published between 1855 and 1859. Irving traveled regularly to Mount Vernon and Washington, D.C. for his research, and <b>struck</b> <b>up</b> friendships with Presidents Millard Fillmore and Franklin Pierce. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855.|$|E
5|$|At 19:00, {{two local}} men spotted Sabina whilst walking a dog on Christchurch Street, Fenton. One {{of the men}} was 54-year-old Glenn Hollinshead – a {{self-employed}} welder, qualified paramedic, and former RAF worker. The other man was his friend Peter Molloy. Sabina appeared friendly and stroked the dog as the three people <b>struck</b> <b>up</b> a conversation. Although friendly, Sabina appeared to be behaving oddly and this odd behaviour worried Molloy. Sabina asked the two men for directions to any nearby bed and breakfasts or hotels. Hollinshead took pity upon her and instead offered to take her back to his house at Duke Street, Fenton. Sabina accepted the offer and the three walked to the house, as Sabina told the men how {{she was trying to}} locate her hospitalised sister.|$|E

5|$|At age 16, Honório Hermeto was {{commissioned}} as a lieutenant and standard-bearer of the 2nd Militia Cavalry Regiment, 1st Company, in Vila Rica. Antônio Neto made great {{efforts to provide}} Honório Hermeto with an education of much higher quality than would normally have been expected {{in a family of}} their limited financial means. The promotion to captain in 1819 increased Antônio Neto's income, allowing his eldest son to go to Portugal and enroll in the University of Coimbra's law school in 1820, thus ending Honório Hermeto's brief military career. He was an excellent student and <b>struck</b> <b>up</b> acquaintances among his fellow Brazilians in Coimbra, including Paulino Soares de Sousa (who would become one of his greatest allies and later the 1st Viscount of Uruguai) and Aureliano de Sousa Oliveira Coutinho (later Viscount of Sepetiba).|$|E
5|$|Gilly {{was later}} seen using his new look {{in attempt to}} get the {{affections}} of Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson). After failing he acted out of character and <b>struck</b> <b>up</b> a scam date with Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) to make Steph jealous but it back-fired when his false tooth came loose in Cheryl's mouth. He later has relationships with Cheryl and Jem Costello (Helen Russell-Clark). Another change implemented during this period was a dramatic change to the character's appearance after new series producer Lucy Allan and Quinlan came to a mutual decision to transform his hairstyle by shaving it all off, a stark contrast as during his early years he was constantly seen with long hair.|$|E
5|$|Valiente {{learned of}} the non-Gardnerian Wiccan Charles Cardell from a 1958 article, and {{subsequently}} <b>struck</b> <b>up</b> a correspondence with him. Cardell suggested that they pool their respective traditions together, but Valiente declined the offer, expressing some scepticism regarding Cardell's motives and conduct. In 1962, Valiente began a correspondence course run by Raymond Howard, a former associate of Cardell's; this course instructed her in a Wiccan tradition known as the Coven of Atho. At Halloween 1963 she was then initiated into the Coven of Atho in a ritual overseen by Howard, entering the lowest rank of the course, that of 'Sarsen', and beginning to copy the teachings that she received into notebooks, where {{she was able to}} identify many of the sources from which Howard had drawn upon in fashioning his tradition.|$|E

They managed to book Room 1511 in the River View Hotel off Havelock Road. The next morning, Martin asked a hotel receptionist to delete Lowe's name from the room registration system, saying that he had kicked Lowe out the previous night for being a homosexual. Martin checked out on 11 March and flew to Bangkok the same day.|$|E
5|$|With Marais's loans {{combined}} with the Ebden scholarship, Smuts began to enjoy a degree of financial security. Though far from affluent {{he was at least}} able to meet his basic expenses. From his second year onwards Smuts began to enter more into the social arena of the university. He ceased to be lonely, making a number of friends and acquaintances, principally amongst the other colonial students. Though no longer so reclusive as he had been during his first year, he remained extremely serious and devoted to his work; an attitude which served as a barrier separating him from the English undergraduates, though not from the Fellows at Cambridge, with many of whom he <b>struck</b> <b>up</b> friendships.|$|E
5|$|According {{to his own}} account, {{the idea}} for writing Dreamtime first came to Duerr {{when he was in}} New Mexico in the summer of 1963. He had spent the day visiting the Puye Cliff Dwellings and was {{returning}} to the Albuquerque Greyhound Bus Station, where he met a Tewa Native yerbatero (herbalist) buying a cup of coffee, and <b>struck</b> <b>up</b> a conversation. Duerr asked the yerbatero if he could help him find a Native family living in one of the pueblos north of Santa Fe with whom he could stay, to conduct anthropological research into the nightly dances {{that took place in the}} subterranean kivas. The Native told him that if he wanted to find out about the dances in the kivas, then he should go to the Pueblo of Our Lady of the Angels and study at the University of California. Duerr would later relate that this blow to his vanity first provided him with the idea of writing Dreamtime.|$|E

5|$|After {{the revolt}} ended in 1174, {{relations}} between HenryII {{and his sons}} continued to be strained. By 1187 Henry the Young King was dead, Richard was in line to inherit, and HenryII {{was on the brink}} of war with PhilipII. In June that year Richard travelled to Paris with PhilipII and <b>struck</b> <b>up</b> a friendship with the French king. Concerned his son might turn against him, HenryII asked him to return. Richard went to Chinon and raided the castle's treasury so he could fund the repair of his own castles in Aquitaine. In 1189 Richard and Philip were wreaking havoc in Maine and Toulouse, capturing HenryII's castles; the king was ill and went to Château de Chinon. He left briefly in July to meet with Richard and PhilipII and agree a truce, and died at Chinon on 6July. The king's body was taken to Fontevraud Abbey and Richard became king.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor also {{broke with}} {{tradition}} by inviting hundreds of African-American guests to the White House. When the black singer Marian Anderson was denied {{the use of}} Washington's Constitution Hall by the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1939, Eleanor resigned from the group in protest and helped arrange another concert {{on the steps of}} the Lincoln Memorial. Roosevelt later presented Anderson to the King and Queen of the United Kingdom after Anderson performed at a White House dinner. Roosevelt also arranged the appointment of African-American educator Mary McLeod Bethune, with whom she had <b>struck</b> <b>up</b> a friendship, as Director of the Division of Negro Affairs of the National Youth Administration. To avoid problems with the staff when Bethune would visit the White House, Eleanor would meet her at the gate, embrace her, and walk in with her arm-in-arm.|$|E
5|$|Keable {{was raised}} in Bedfordshire and educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge. He entered a {{theological}} college after graduation and was ordained a priest in 1911. He spent {{the next several years}} as a missionary in Africa, stationed on Zanzibar and in Basutoland, before returning to Europe as an army chaplain during the First World War. There, he met {{and fell in love with}} a young nurse, Grace Eileen Joly Beresford Buck, a development over which he eventually quit the Church of England and left his wife, Sybil. Returning to England after the war, Keable resigned his ministry and began to write novels: his first, 1921's Simon Called Peter, became a runaway success and launched Keable into a life of literary celebrity. Increasingly disillusioned with the hypocrisies he saw in contemporary British life, he and Buck left Europe for Tahiti in 1922. The couple lived there happily until Buck's death in childbirth in 1924, after which Keable's health began to fade. He nonetheless <b>struck</b> <b>up</b> a later relationship with a Tahitian woman, Ina, with whom he had a son, and continued to publish novels until his death of a kidney condition in 1927.|$|E
