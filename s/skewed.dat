5|$|A {{persistent}} folktale on Sumatra and Borneo and {{in popular}} culture, is that male orangutans display sexual attraction to human women, {{and may even}} forcibly copulate with them. The only serious, but anecdotal, report of such an incident taking place, is primatologist Birutė Galdikas' report that her cook was sexually assaulted by a male orangutan. This orangutan, though, was raised in captivity and may have suffered from a <b>skewed</b> species identity, and forced copulation is a standard mating strategy for low-ranking male orangutans.|$|E
5|$|Age {{distribution}} is 22.0% {{under the age}} of 18, 10.7% from 18 to 24, 36.1% from 25 to 44, 20.0% from 45 to 64, and 11.3% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 33 years. Overall there are 102.1 males for every 100 females, but in 2015 for the category of never-married ages 25 to 34 there are 121.4 males for every 100 females. Due to a <b>skewed</b> sex ratio wherein single men outnumber single women, some protologists have nicknamed the city as Menver.|$|E

5|$|Anti-communist {{resistance}} in Poland was also bolstered, {{and a group}} of opposition leaders and cultural figures founded the Klub Krzywego Koła (<b>Skewed</b> Wheel Club) in Warsaw. It promoted discussions about Polish independence, questioned the efficiency of the state controlled economy, and government disdain and even persecution of veterans of the Polish Armed Forces in the West and the Armia Krajowa resistance during World War II. While the intelligentsia expressed their dissatisfaction with discussions and publications (bibuła), workers took to the streets. The living conditions in Poland did not improve, contrary to government propaganda, and workers increasingly found that they had little power compared to bureaucracy of the Party (nomenklatura).|$|E
5|$|Film noir is {{also known}} for its use of low-angle, wide-angle, and <b>skewed,</b> or Dutch angle shots. Other devices of {{disorientation}} relatively common in film noir include shots of people reflected {{in one or more}} mirrors, shots through curved or frosted glass or other distorting objects (such as during the strangulation scene in Strangers on a Train), and special effects sequences of a sometimes bizarre nature. Night-for-night shooting, as opposed to the Hollywood norm of day-for-night, was often employed. From the mid-1940s forward, location shooting became increasingly frequent in noir.|$|E

5000|$|Jeu-de-taquin slides change {{not only}} the {{relative}} order of the entries of a tableau, but also its shape. In the definition given above, {{the result of a}} jeu-de-taquin slide is given as a <b>skew</b> diagram along with a <b>skew</b> standard tableau having it as shape. Often, it is better to work with <b>skew</b> shapes rather than <b>skew</b> diagrams. (Recall that every <b>skew</b> shape [...] gives rise to a <b>skew</b> diagram , but this is not an injective correspondence because, e. g., the distinct <b>skew</b> shapes [...] and [...] yield the same <b>skew</b> diagram.) For this reason, it is useful to modify the above definition of a jeu-de-taquin slide in such a way that, when given a <b>skew</b> shape along with a <b>skew</b> standard tableau and an addable cell as an input, it yields a well-defined <b>skew</b> shape along with a <b>skew</b> standard tableau at its output. This is done as follows: An inward slide of a <b>skew</b> tableau T of <b>skew</b> shape [...] into a cell c is defined as above when c is a corner of [...] (that is, when [...] is a Young diagram), and the resulting <b>skew</b> shape is set to be [...] where d is the empty cell {{at the end of the}} sliding procedure.

5|$|Since the Norse sources (including the skaldic verses {{which were}} the sagas' main sources) chiefly {{describe}} war-related matters, less is known about other events during the reigns of the early Norwegian kings. Snorri, for instance, wrote fifteen pages about Magnus and only two pages about Magnus' peaceful father Olaf Kyrre (despite Olaf's reign lasting almost three times longer than Magnus'). Modern historians have noted that this probably has made the image of kings like Magnus Barefoot one-sided (in Magnus' case, <b>skewed</b> towards his deeds as a warrior).|$|E
5|$|The bobcat {{has long}} been valued both for fur and sport; it has been hunted and trapped by humans, but has {{maintained}} a high population, even in the southern United States, where it is extensively hunted. In the 1970s and 1980s, an unprecedented rise in price for bobcat fur caused further interest in hunting, but by the early 1990s, prices had dropped significantly. Regulated hunting still continues, with half of mortality of some populations being attributed to this cause. As a result, the rate of bobcat deaths is <b>skewed</b> in winter, when hunting season is generally open.|$|E
5|$|The {{build-up}} {{of toxins}} and pollutants in seabirds {{is also a}} concern. Seabirds, being apex predators, suffered from the ravages of DDT until it was banned; among other effects, DDT was implicated in embryo development problems and the <b>skewed</b> sex ratio of western gulls in southern California. Oil spills are also a threat to seabird species, as both a toxin and because the feathers of the birds become saturated by the oil, causing them to lose their waterproofing. Oil pollution threatens species with restricted ranges or already depressed populations.|$|E
40|$|Clock <b>skew</b> {{is often}} cited as an {{impediment}} to designing high-performance synchronous circuits. Clock <b>skew</b> reduces {{the performance of a}} circuit by reducing the time available for computation, and it may even cause circuit failure by allowing race conditions. In this paper, we show how to use retiming to reduce the effect of clock <b>skew</b> in both edge-clocked and level-clocked circuits. We include both fixed clock <b>skew,</b> for example <b>skew</b> which results from clock distribution wiring and buffering, and variable clock <b>skew</b> which results from uncontrolled variation in process parameter and operating conditions. By including fixed <b>skew</b> in the maximum constraint equations retiming can find the fastest circuit given that <b>skew.</b> By including variable <b>skew,</b> retiming can also generate the circuit that tolerates the most variation in clock <b>skew</b> for a given clock frequency.

The highest reported growth rates are from sharks in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the lowest from sharks off northeastern Taiwan. Males and females reach sexual maturity at ages of 6–10years and 7–12+years, respectively. Sharks from more temperate waters may grow slower and mature later than those in warmer regions.

5|$|Adults outnumber juveniles in most populations, but gauging the ratios is {{difficult}} because juveniles are harder to catch; with current sampling methods, estimates of age distribution vary widely.

For females, the annual survival rate rises to 45% for juveniles and 95% for adults. The male survival rates follow a similar pattern, but are lower overall than females, creating an average male age {{lower than that of}} the female. Natural disasters can confound age distributions. For instance, a hurricane can destroy many nests in a region, resulting in fewer hatchlings the next year. Age distributions may also be <b>skewed</b> by migrations of adults.|$|E

Gibbons writes that a queen's duty was to secure the succession to the crown and look after her husband; historians described Isabeau as having failed in both respects, and she came to be seen as one of the great villains of history. Gibbons goes on to say that even her physical appearance is uncertain; depictions of her vary depending on whether she was to be portrayed as good or evil.|$|E
