5000|$|Even {{if we were}} {{to adopt}} the {{equitable}} tolling doctrine in this case, Riemers' failure to commence his action against <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> within <b>the</b> statute of limitations was not the result of his timely pursuit of one of several other available legal remedies which may have tolled the statute of limitations. Rather, as in Reid, 2000 ND 108, ¶ 16, 611 N.W.2d 187, Riemers' failure to commence his action within the statute of limitations resulted from his failure to effectuate timely <b>service</b> of process <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants.</b> We therefore conclude the equitable tolling doctrine would not apply to Riemers' claims.|$|R
5000|$|In the U.S. {{state of}} Nebraska, State Senator Ernie Chambers filed a suit in 2008 against God, seeking a {{permanent}} injunction against God's harmful activities, {{as an effort}} to publicize the issue of public access to the court system. The suit was dismissed because God could not be properly notified, not having a fixed address. The Judge stated, [...] "Given that this court finds that there can never be <b>service</b> effectuated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> named <b>defendant</b> this action will be dismissed with prejudice". The senator, assuming God to be singular and all-knowing, responded [...] "The court itself acknowledges the existence of God. A consequence of that acknowledgement is a recognition of God's omniscience ... Since God knows everything, God has notice of this lawsuit." [...] Chambers filed the lawsuit in response to another lawsuit that he considered to be frivolous and inappropriate.|$|R
5000|$|Justice Scalia took a {{historical}} approach to answering this question. In Justice Scalia's view, buttressed by citation of numerous cases, [...] "among the most firmly established principles of personal jurisdiction in American tradition {{is that the}} courts of a State have jurisdiction over nonresidents who are physically present in the State." [...] At common law, <b>service</b> of process <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> within <b>the</b> forum state was a prerequisite to exercising jurisdiction over <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> in that state. In cases such as International Shoe Co. v. Washington and Shaffer v. Heitner, the Court had accepted that a non-resident served outside a state could still be subject to jurisdiction, but only where <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> had [...] "certain minimum contacts with it such that {{the maintenance of the}} suit does not offend 'traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.'" [...] However, these cases did not support the converse argument that the longstanding practice of obtaining jurisdiction over a defendant by serving process within the forum might now violate due process. [...] "A a doctrine of personal jurisdiction that dates back to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment and is still generally observed unquestionably meets the standard" [...] of due process.|$|R

50|$|At common law, {{recognized}} by the Supreme Court in Pennoyer v.
