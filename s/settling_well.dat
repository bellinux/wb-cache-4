"My dear Sir Thomas, I {{perfectly}} comprehend you, and {{do justice}} to the generosity and delicacy of your notions, which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct; and I entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one's own hands; and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion. Having no children of my own, who should I look to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow, but the children of my sisters?--and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just--but you know I am a woman of few words and professions. Do not let us be frightened from a good deed by a trifle. Give a girl an education, and introduce her properly into the world, and ten to one but she has the means of <b>settling</b> <b>well,</b> without farther expense to anybody. A niece of ours, Sir Thomas, I may say, or at least of yours, would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages. I don't say she would be so handsome as her cousins. I dare say she would not; but she would be introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable circumstances as, in all human probability, would get her a creditable establishment. You are thinking of your sons--but do not you know that, of all things upon earth, that is the least likely to happen, brought up as they would be, always together like brothers and sisters? It is morally impossible. I never knew an instance of it. It is, in fact, the only sure way of providing against the connexion. Suppose her a pretty girl, and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence, and I dare say there would be mischief. The very idea of her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect, would be enough to make either of the dear, sweet-tempered boys in love with her. But breed her up with them from this time, and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel, and she will never be more to either than a sister." ...|$|E

40|$|Analyzing {{the topic}} of {{education}} in two nineteenth-century novels, Mansfield Park and Wuthering Heights, apart from introduction and conclusion, the paper consist of the main parts which, divided into two sections, regards different aspects of education in two mentioned novels. The first section of the main part deals with the aspects of education taking place in three major Mansfield Park’s localities paying {{particular attention to the}} one of Mansfield Park where the novel’s heroine, Fanny Price, receives her education. Having answered the question what the novel’s author, Jane Austen, sees as the prime concern in education of young girls during that period, the rest of the analysis concerns {{the topic of}} education in Mansfield Park referring to Fanny Price’s role both of a student and a teacher, as well as the way in which novel presents the influence of different environments on educational practices. Presenting conduct, morality, and principles as the prime concern of the education, Austen chooses characters coming from the localities of Mansfield Park, London, and Portsmouth to stress the influence different environments have on the approach to the education. With the end of the novel, Austen presents a triumph of education with Fanny both becoming a role-model of a proper education and meeting her Aunt Norris’s expectations by finding husband and <b>settling</b> <b>well.</b> The second section of the main part regards the topic of education inside Emily Brontë’s novel Wuthering Heights. Again, starting with the case of a child named Heathcliff brought into Earnshaw family, the paper discusses the aspects of education, specifically denial of it happening at a more narrow localities than the ones in Austen’s novel. With the revengeful denial of education experienced by Heathcliff, and later on by Hareton Earnshaw, Brontë relates education with the questions of class and colonialism. Similarly to Austen, Emily Brontë uses two different localities to stress the influence of environment on education 49 and upbringing of novel’s characters. By confronting the estates of Wuthering Heights and Trushcross Grange, not only does Brontë present the personal conflicts happening between their tenants, but she also shows the amount of attention she pays to the topic of education in her novel. In this sense, only when the proper educational climate taking place at Trushcross Grange takes root in Wuthering Heights does the novel reach its end. Presenting intersections of two novels, conclusion part points at the way both Jane Austen and Emily Brontë bring the topic of education in a close relation to the other aspects of characters’ lives. Introduction and upbringing of the Other in Bertram and Earnshaw family gives space to analyzing the topic of education by relating it to the questions of class, economy, colonialism, regional division, religion, gender, choice of one’s marriage partner, etc., thus proving that the topic analyzed in this paper {{plays an important role in}} stories of Mansfield Park and Wuthering Heights...|$|E
