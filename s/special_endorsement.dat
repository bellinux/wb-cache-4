50|$|The Licensing and Regulation Division issues liquor licenses, which {{numbered}} 14,604 {{in fiscal}} year 2006. Liquor licenses are issued to businesses and not-for-profit organizations. Various licenses exist and each license is suited to {{a particular type of}} business and product mix. Breweries, wineries, and distilleries would be licensed to produce their specific class of alcoholic beverages. Wholesalers and distributors would be licensed to buy beer and/or wine from breweries and wineries and sell to retailers. Retail licenses fit two categories depending on where the alcohol will be consumed. Retailers like grocery stores are licensed to sell beer, wine, and spirits to customers who take the products home or elsewhere. Retailers like bars and restaurants are licensed to serve alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption.

5000|$|The {{majority}} of flight testing was performed at Zamperini Field in Torrance, California. Flight {{testing and certification}} was performed in the late 1970s by test pilot Joseph John [...] "Tym" [...] Tymczyszyn and the R22 received FAA certification in March 1979.Due to relatively low acquisition and operating costs, the R22 has been popular as a primary rotorcraft trainer {{around the world and}} as a livestock management tool on large ranches in North America and cattle stations in Australia. The R22 has a very low inertia rotor system and the control inputs are operated directly by push rods with no hydraulic assistance. Thus, the flight controls are very sensitive and require a light touch to avoid over correcting. A student that masters an R22 generally does not have a problem transitioning to a heavier helicopter. Due to the issues relating to a low inertia rotor system and a teetering main rotor, operation by any pilot in the United States of the Robinson R22 or Robinson R44 requires a <b>special</b> <b>endorsement</b> by a certified flight instructor. Tip weights were added to increase rotor inertia, but the small rotor limits weight.|$|E
30|$|Because this {{research}} focuses on alternatives to the traditional, self-contained model of elementary instruction, we exclude {{in the following sections}} research related to teacher mentoring models of content coaches and intervention specialists and focus instead on full-time classroom teachers who teach two or more classes of students in either mathematics or science.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) added a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program, to become effective January 1, 2006. To assist Medicare beneficiaries with their prescription drug costs until the new benefit becomes available, the MMA also required {{the establishment of a}} temporary program, the Medicare Prescription Drug Discount Card and Transitional Assistance Program, which began in June 2004. The drug card program is designed to offer Medicare beneficiaries access to discounts off the retail price of prescription drugs. All Medicare beneficiaries, except those receiving Medicaid drug coverage, are eligible to enroll in the drug card program. Certain low-income beneficiaries without other drug coverage qualify for an additional benefit, a transitional assistance (TA) subsidy, that can be applied toward the cost of drugs covered under the drug card program. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) [...] the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs [...] administers and oversees the drug card program. The drug cards themselves are offered and managed by private organizations, known as drug card sponsors. There are different types of drug cards. General drug cards are available to all eligible beneficiaries living in a card's service area; there are both national and regional general cards. Exclusive and <b>special</b> <b>endorsement</b> drug cards are available to specific beneficiary groups. Some drug card sponsors offer more than one drug card.

40|$|Presidential {{candidates}} often {{pursue the}} endorsements {{of elected officials}} hoping to boost the candidate’s chances of electoral success. But do these endorsements really enhance electoral outcomes? This study pays <b>special</b> attention to <b>endorsements</b> by sitting U. S. senators, U. S.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the standards and criteria of graduate programs and credential requirements for special education administrators; ascertain practicing administrators' representative functions and performance requirements; and determine if interrelationships exist among these variables. Data were ordered in a format that should contribute to planning at the national, state and university levels. Data were gathered from universities, state education agencies and special education administrators. Universities, states and practicing administrators agreed that coursework/competency requirements emphasizing training and experience in both general and special education is appropriate. Fifty-six percent of the universities reported offering the necessary coursework in both areas, but only thirty-eight percent of the states had such requirements. In general, universities had more specific requirements than states. However, the coursework emphases and state requirements were found to be inconsistent with administrators' perceptions of knowledge and skills important to their jobs. Currently, forty states require certification for special education administrators: 13 as Directors of Special Education, 7 as Special Education Supervisors, 8 as General Administrators with <b>Special</b> Education <b>Endorsement,</b> 12 as General Administrators. Additionally, four states offer but do not require administrative credentials and two states require teaching credentials only. It was concluded that graduate programs often do not prepare special education administrators for the roles they actually perform. University and state requirements should parallel one another and both should reflect basic skills and competencies required on the job. Graduate program requirements need to place more emphasis in the areas of law and legal issues, public relations, fiscal procedures, personnel management, supervision and evaluation [...] both as basic administrative competencies and skills and as they relate to special education in particular. Appropriate internship experiences should be required by states as well as universities to provide expertise in such areas as report writing and public relations...|$|R
