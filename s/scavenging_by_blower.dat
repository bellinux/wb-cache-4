40|$|The {{relative}} rate of cyclohexyl radical <b>scavenging</b> <b>by</b> oxygen or 4 -oxo- 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidino-N-oxyl {{has been}} measured at 250 C, {{together with the}} relative rates of cyclohexyl peroxy radical attack on cyclohexane or substituted hydroxylamines derived from 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine. These competitive processes are important in the stabilisation of polymers against photo-oxidative destruction by piperidine derivatives. Peroxy radical <b>scavenging</b> <b>by</b> the substituted hydroxylamine appears to be considerably more important than alkyl radical <b>scavenging</b> <b>by</b> the nitroxide, although both processes are essential for prolonged ultra violet (uv) stabilisation of a polymer. However, a comparison of experimental photo-protection with that predicted by the measured rate constant ratios shows that other processes are needed to account entirely for the observed stabilisation. Other factors which {{may be involved in}} piperidine photo-protection of polymers include thermal decomposition of the substituted hydroxylamine to reform nitroxide in polar(oxidised) zones and especially the association of nitroxides with hydroperoxide groups (the dominant photo-initiator in degrading polyolefins).

Contamination due to {{the surface}} {{deposition}} of radioactive material from the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station was investigated for 11 March to 17 March 2011. A coupled weather and dispersion modeling system was developed and simulations of the accident performed using two independent source terms that differed in emission rate and height and in {{the total amount of}} radioactive material released. Results show significant differences in the distribution of cumulative surface deposition of 137 Cs due to wet and dry removal processes. Parameterizations for precipitation <b>scavenging</b> <b>by</b> rain, snow, and graupel were implemented to investigate surface wet deposition fields. Results show aerosols from a source term with emission heights at 50, 300, and 1000 meters above ground level (AGL) were <b>scavenged</b> <b>by</b> rain (70 %) and graupel (30 %) compared with a source term with emission heights at 20 and 120 meters AGL in which material was <b>scavenged</b> preferentially <b>by</b> rain (95 %). A sensitivity study was performed that broadened the particle size distribution (PSD) of the source terms during explosive events of the accident. Results for the source term with elevated emission heights show enhanced wet deposition due to <b>scavenging</b> <b>by</b> snow (5 %, 35 %, 51 %) compared with <b>scavenging</b> <b>by</b> rain and graupel as the effluent PSD was increased (0. 5, 1. 0, and 10 m, respectively). In contrast, the source term with relatively lower emission heights remained preferentially <b>scavenged</b> <b>by</b> rain (90 %). A second study that investigated the complexity of the cloud microphysics scheme showed that precipitation scavenging of radioactive material was not very sensitive to the choice of single-vs. double-moment cloud microphysics parameterization. A comparison of 137 Cs deposition predicted by the model with aircraft observations of surface-deposited gamma radiation showed reasonable agreement in surface contamination patterns during the dry phase of the accident. During the wet phase the pattern is not as well predicted. It is suggested that this discrepancy is because of differences between model predicted and observed precipitation distributions. Dry deposition was the dominant removal process, accounting for the majority of surface contamination (12 orders of magnitude over that due to wet deposition near the source) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{value of}} air {{permeability}} or {{the value of}} n 50 provides important information about the impermeability of the building envelope and thus the quality of internal environment of the building. It {{is also one of}} the main evaluation criteria in classifying energy efficient buildings. Air permeability is determined <b>by</b> <b>Blower</b> Door Test where the fan blows air in or out from the measured area. The measurement is performed in a overpressure and afterwards in a underpressure during which the leaks are detected. The frame is usually placed into the front door which themselves is a link part in the building envelope and thus the rate of leakage completely denies. The effect of leakage of the front door is so significant that it can often cause a misclassification of the energy efficient buildings. We have tested this hypothesis <b>by</b> <b>Blower</b> Door Test on a passive timber construction build in 2007 during which we have measured the object in position of measuring device placed in the front door and the balcony door that are not encumbered by leaks caused by a security hardware and by other specific elements...|$|R

50|$|Iodotyrosine deiodinase, {{also known}} as {{iodotyrosine}} dehalogenase 1, {{is a type of}} deiodinase enzyme that <b>scavenges</b> iodide <b>by</b> removing it from iodinated tyrosine residues in the thyroid gland. These iodinated tyrosines are produced during thyroid hormone biosynthesis. The iodide that is <b>scavenged</b> <b>by</b> iodotyrosine deiodinase is necessary to again synthesize the thyroid hormones. After synthesis, the thyroid hormones circulate through the body to regulate metabolic rate, protein expression, and body temperature. Iodotyrosine deiodinase is thus necessary to keep levels of both iodide and thyroid hormones in balance.|$|R
40|$|Vertebrate {{scavengers}} are primary {{mechanisms for}} scatter and disarticulation of human remains in rural habitats. Because {{recovery of the}} body can be hampered by the degree of scatter due to scavengers, the methods used to search for body parts will influence how much is found {{and the length of}} time taken to recover the body. We compared the frequency of <b>scavenging</b> <b>by</b> vertebrates in two different habitats, a deciduous forest and a tall grass meadow, and measured the time taken to search for scattered remains within a designated search area using four methods. Freshly killed 23 kg pigs were placed in either a forest or tall grass meadow habitat, and <b>scavenging</b> <b>by</b> vertebrates was observed over a 5 – 6 day period. Subsequently, the link, line, zone, and spiral methods were used to search for remains within a 21 m 2 search area. Three of 5 pigs in the forest and 4 of 5 pigs in the meadow habitat were <b>scavenged</b> <b>by</b> a variety of vertebrates. Mean time to search the designated area around each pig differed between the forest and the meadow, but not by search method. Mobility within each habitat likely explains the difference in search times, and also accounts for some of the variability between search methods...|$|R
