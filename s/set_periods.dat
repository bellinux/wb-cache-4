2500|$|The prefix [...] "Temporary" [...] {{before a}} rank (e.g. Temporary Detective Sergeant, {{abbreviated}} T/DS) denotes an officer {{who has been}} temporarily promoted to a rank (and so who does actually hold that rank, albeit on a temporary basis), whilst the prefix [...] "Acting" [...] (e.g. Acting Inspector, abbreviated A/Insp) denotes an officer who is performing {{the role of a}} higher rank than the one actually held (sometimes informally termed [...] "acting up"). Temporary ranks are often used for <b>set</b> <b>periods</b> (e.g. a six-month appointment to a particular role), whereas acting ranks, although sometimes held for extended periods, are often used for a very short time (e.g. a single shift when additional supervisory officers are required, or to replace an officer on short-term leave).|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} such {{developments}} there have arisen projects {{attempting to make}} the vast number and array of verse miscellanies more accessible to modern researchers and readers, most prominently {{through the process of}} online digitization. In 2012 [...] was launched, which offers a searchable critical edition of seven printed verse miscellanies published in the 16th and early 17th centuries. While some projects focus on creating online editions of the most significant verse miscellanies, others have attempted to arrange a corpus of miscellanies produced in <b>set</b> <b>periods,</b> such as [...] (2006-2009), a digital archive of manuscript miscellanies and commonplace books from c. 1450-1720. The largest undertaking by far has been , an ongoing project funded by the Leverhulme Trust. [...] The Index seeks to create a freely available online database of the 1000-plus verse miscellanies published in the 18th century, based on a comprehensive bibliography compiled by Michael F. Suarez, and supplied by the world’s single largest collection of miscellanies held in The Bodleian Library’s Harding Collection. Begun in 2010, this project was successfully completed in September 2013. The database is currently available in a [...]|$|E

50|$|Another form {{of flight}} data {{recorder}} {{was developed in the}} UK during World War II. Len Harrison and Vic Husband developed a unit that could withstand a crash and fire to keep the flight data intact. This unit used copper foil as the recording medium with various styli indicating various instruments / aircraft controls which indented the copper foil. The copper foil was periodically advanced at <b>set</b> <b>periods</b> of time therefore giving a history of the instruments / control settings of the aircraft. This unit was developed at Farnborough for the Ministry of Aircraft Production. At the war's end the Ministry got Harrison and Husband to sign over their invention to them and the Ministry patented it under British patent 19330/45. This unit was the forerunner of today's black boxes being able to withstand conditions that aircrew could not.|$|E
