Afraid of ruining the bubble, Leslie initially tells Ben she is not related to Marlene. Right before Ben's meeting, however, Leslie admits Marlene is her mother, making him nervous and causing him to capitulate to all of her demands during the meeting. Marlene considers Ben weak, so Leslie becomes determined to prove that he is a tough boss to impress Marlene.|$|E

60|$|I {{remember}} {{one pair of}} otters that I watched {{for the better part}} of a sunny afternoon sliding down a clay bank with endless delight. The slide had been made, with much care evidently, on the steep side of a little promontory that jutted into the river. It was very steep, about twenty feet high, and had been made perfectly smooth by much sliding and wetting-down. An otter would appear at the top of the bank, throw himself forward on his belly and shoot downward like a flash, diving deep under water and reappearing some distance out from the foot of the slide. And all this with marvelous stillness, as if the very woods had ears and were listening to betray the shy creatures at their fun. For it was fun, pure and <b>simple,</b> <b>and</b> <b>fun</b> with no end of tingle and excitement in it, especially when one tried to catch the other and shot into the water at his very heels.|$|E

This is when they bond with other cats. It has been suspected that without any human contact during this time, the cat would forever mistrust humans.|$|R

50|$|During {{the late}} 1970s video-arcade game {{technology}} had become sophisticated enough to offer good-quality graphics and sounds, but it remained fairly basic (realistic images and full motion video {{were not yet}} available, {{and only a few}} games used spoken voice) and so the success of a game had to rely on <b>simple</b> <b>and</b> <b>fun</b> gameplay.

40|$|Abstract — We {{describe}} GXP, a shell for distributed multicluster environments. With GXP, {{users can}} quickly submit a command to many nodes simultaneously (approximately 600 milliseconds on over 300 nodes spread across five local-area networks). It therefore brings an interactive and instantaneous response to many cluster/network operations, such as trouble diagnosis, parallel program invocation, installation and deployment, testing and debugging, monitoring, and dead process cleanup. It features (1) {{a very fast}} parallel (simultaneous) command submission, (2) parallel pipes (pipes between local command and all parallel commands), and (3) a flexible and efficient method to interactively select a subset of nodes to execute subsequent commands on. It {{is very easy to}} start using GXP, because it is designed not to require cumbersome per-node setup and installation and to depend only on {{a very small number of}} pre-installed tools and nothing else. We describe how GXP achieves these features and demonstrate through examples how they make many otherwise boring <b>and</b> error-prone tasks <b>simple,</b> efficient, <b>and</b> <b>fun.</b> I...|$|R

500|$|AllGame editor Brett Alan Weiss's {{retrospective}} {{review was}} critical {{as he called}} Slalom [...] "a rush job" [...] that did not capture the spirit of skiing. He felt that the game was repetitive, too <b>simple,</b> <b>and</b> not <b>fun</b> for adults. Weiss described the graphics as blocky and insipid, the sound as repetitive and derivative. He said that {{even though it was}} an early release in the console's lifespan, Slalom was on par with the 1979 Intellivision's capabilities. He recommended Konami's Antarctic Adventure for the ColecoVision in its stead. UK-based magazine Retro Gamer wrote that the game received little fanfare. The magazine's Stuart Hunt wrote in December2010, on Rare's 25th anniversary, that the game was [...] "fun but quite simplistic" [...] in its lack of race variety. He said, though, that the game showcased how the company could maximize the system resources of the NES. Slalom was included in Rare Replay, a compilation of 30 Rare titles, released on the Xbox One on August 4, 2015.|$|R
40|$|Ext 2 is fast, <b>simple,</b> robust, <b>and</b> <b>fun</b> to hack on. However, it {{has fallen}} out of favor for one ma-jor reason: if an ext 2 file system is not cleanly unmounted, {{such as in the}} event of kernel crash or power loss, it must be {{repaired}} using fsck, which takes minutes or hours to complete, dur-ing which time the file system is unavailable. In this paper, we describe some techniques for reducing the average fsck time on ext 2 file sys-tems. First, we avoid running fsck in some cases by adding a filesystem-wide dirty bit in-dicating whether the file system was being ac-tively modified at the time it crashed. The per-formance of ext 2 with this change is close to that of plain ext 2, and quite a bit faster than ext 3. Second, we propose a technique called linked writes which uses dependent writes and a list of dirty inodes to allow recovery of an ac-tive file system by only repairing the dirty in-odes and avoiding a full file system check. ...|$|R

Marlene considers Ben weak, so Leslie becomes determined to prove that he is a tough boss to impress Marlene. Meanwhile, Chris (Rob Lowe) has enacted numerous changes to the parks department; he promotes Jerry (Jim O'Heir) to public relations director, appoints April (Aubrey Plaza) as everyone's assistant, places Tom (Aziz Ansari) on the nightmarish fourth floor with Andy (Chris Pratt) as his temporary assistant, and makes Ron (Nick Offerman) sit {{in the middle of a}} circular desk after the removal of his office, to force him to interact with people. Ron believes everything will eventually go back to normal as it has with past city managers that implemented drastic changes. However, Donna (Retta) is concerned the overly-determined Chris will not do so and demands that Ron talk to him. On the fourth floor, Tom's attempts to charm some of the elderly women into doing his work fails miserably, as they ignore him and all adore Andy. Leslie trains Ben for his next meeting with her mother. He impresses Marlene so much with his tough negotiation skills that she becomes flirtatious with him. An uncomfortable Ben tells Leslie they should tell her about their relationship, but Leslie does not want to lose the bubble. Fed up, Ben storms into Marlene's office and tells her that he is dating her daughter and asks her to keep it secret. Marlene laughs off the situation and tells Leslie that she approves of Ben. Meanwhile, Ron tells Chris the changes do not play to his staff's strengths because Jerry only does well in the background, Tom only does well if people are all aware of his activities, and April only does well if people leave her the hell alone. Chris takes in Ron's well-reasoned arguments and they cut a deal where Chris will return everything to the way it was after Ron does one more week of interacting with the public. Nevertheless, Tom is frustrated with the experience and begins to contemplate leaving his city hall job to pursue his own entrepreneurial interests.|$|E
