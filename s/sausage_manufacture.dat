40|$|The need {{to renew}} the safety {{criteria}} for meat raw material used in production of fermented sausages was determined. The presence of the enterotoxigenic S. aureus strains in meat raw material was established. The method was mastered and the PCR approaches to identification and screenings of enterotoxigenic strains and their toxins in meat raw material were proposed. In order to identify enterotoxigenicity of detected staphylococci, the conservative regions of the S. aureus target gene sequences responsible for production {{of different types of}} enterotoxins (A, B, Е, С, D) were found and studied. In addition, short fragments of a nuclear acid (primers) corresponding to these revealed genes were constructed.

One of them produced type А and Е toxins (strain NG 1) and another produced type С and Е toxins (strain NG 2). The sensitivity and specificity of the real-time PCR method allowed not only identification of pure cultures but also screening of enterotoxigenic strains and their toxins in a product.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the quality and stability of Mortadella produced with MSML added of sodium erythorbate (1000 ppm) and sodium nitrite (150 ppm) through preblending or during chopper processing (control treatment), after long term frozen storage of raw meat ingredient. The products were stored for 40 days at 7 ºC and evaluated in regard to the oxidative stability of lipids (TBARS values), objective color, and microbiological and sensory attributes. Preblending MSML lessened rancidity of the final product in comparison to the control (0. 2 and 2. 2 mg malonaldehyde per kg, respectively), and elicited better color (a* = 7. 5 and 10. 5, respectively).

Ninety-six strains were studied to evaluate nitrate reductase, proteolytic, lipolytic and antioxidant activities as well as growth ability at different temperatures, pH s and NaCl concentrations. All the strains were classified as Staphylococcus except for one isolate assigned to Kocuria spp. The species most often isolated were S. saprophyticus, S. xylosus and S. equorum, although they were not equally distributed within the different sausages. Other species isolated were, in descending order of abundance, S. succinus, S. warneri, S. lentus, S. vitulus, S. pasteuri, S. epidermidis, and S. haemolyticus. In general, the S. xylosus strains exhibited the best technological properties that would make them eligible as good starter cultures for fermented meat products. However, strains belonging to other species also showed good technological properties. Finally, all strains grew at 10, 15 and 20 C, in the presence of 10 % and 15 % of NaCl and at pH 5. 0 and 5. 5.

Because of the toxic effects of nitrite, to replace the use of nitrite mostly natural additives. Tomato industries yield a high amount of by-products mainly tomato peel and seeds.

All samples have been stored at- 18 °C for 3 months. As the level of nitrite was reduced, the oxidation level of the beef sausage was increased significantly. Addition of tomato peel decreased the level of oxidation when compared to the samples which did not contain tomato peel. According to this result it can be stated that tomato peel retards the oxidation reaction. Nitrosomyoglobin (NOMb) content of the samples was decreased along with the decreased level of nitrite. Hardness values of treated samples were significantly (p< 0. 05) higher than those of control samples. According to sensorial evaluations, tomato peel improved the consumer acceptability as well.
