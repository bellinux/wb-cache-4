40|$|The {{offshore}} {{petroleum industry}} is {{of critical importance}} to the global economy. Offshore petroleum installations are considered elements of critical national infrastructure in many nation-States and their security may have significant implications for national security and economic wellbeing. Violence at sea is a very common occurrence today and major petroleum producing and consuming States {{are concerned about the}} protection <b>of</b> offshore petroleum <b>installations</b> from attacks and unlawful interferences, especially acts of terrorism. In recent years, the international community has taken a number of regulatory measures to enhance the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> the maritime transport and offshore petroleum sectors. The thesis examines the types <b>of</b> <b>security</b> threats to offshore petroleum <b>installations,</b> the types <b>of</b> attacks that have been carried out against offshore installations, and factors that make offshore installations attractive targets including their vulnerabilities and potential impacts that can result from deliberate attacks on these vital facilities. This thesis also analyses the international legal framework for maritime and offshore petroleum security with the aim of determining whether the international legal framework adequately addresses the protection and <b>security</b> <b>of</b> offshore petroleum <b>installations.</b> Specifically, it analyses {{the law of the sea}} framework established under the umbrella of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 as well as other international legal instruments and regulatory measures pertaining to the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> offshore <b>installations.</b> The original contribution made by this thesis includes the compilation of a comprehensive chronology of attacks on and interferences with offshore petroleum <b>installations,</b> the analysis <b>of</b> various <b>security</b> threats faced by offshore petroleum <b>installations,</b> examination <b>of</b> factors that make offshore petroleum installations attractive targets, and a detailed analysis of the international regulatory framework. The thesis concludes that there are gaps and limitations in the current international regulatory framework for the protection and <b>security</b> <b>of</b> offshore petroleum <b>installations.</b> It argues that there is a scope for improvement in the international legal framework and that further regulatory changes are necessary at the international level in order to enhance <b>security</b> <b>of</b> offshore petroleum <b>installations.</b> The thesis also provides several specific suggestions that would improve the international legal framework for the protection and <b>security</b> <b>of</b> offshore petroleum <b>installations...</b>|$|R

40|$|After the {{accident}} of Toulose and {{the terrorist attack}} of September 11, interest is growing about the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> process plants: recommendations [1], guidelines [2] and standards [3], have been issued and security risk assessment (SRA) approaches have been proposed in the literature [4 - 10]; other works assess the attractiveness and/or vulnerability of industrial targets [11 - 13]. Among the various factors affecting the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> a process plant, {{the layout of the}} plant may play a significant role, since the different parts <b>of</b> the <b>installation</b> may be more or less easily reached by a terrorist attack and present different potentials for causing a major accident, including the possibility of domino effects.

40|$|With {{photovoltaic}} (PV) systems proliferating in {{the last}} few years due to the high prices of fossil fuels and pollution issues, among others, it is extremely important to monitor the efficiency of these plants and optimize the energy production process. This will also result in improvements related to the maintenance and <b>security</b> <b>of</b> the <b>installation.</b> In order to do so, the main parameters in the plant must be continuously monitored so that the appropriate actions can be carried out. This monitoring should not only be carried out at a global level, but also at panel-level, so that a better understanding of what is actually happening in the PV plant can be obtained. This paper presents a system based on a wireless sensor network (WSN) that includes all the components required for such monitoring as well as a power supply obtaining the energy required by the sensors from the photovoltaic panels. The system proposed succeeds in identifying all the nodes in the network and provides real-time monitoring while tracking efficiency, features, failures and weaknesses from a single cell up to the whole infrastructure. Thus, the decision-making process is simplified, which contributes to reducing failures, wastes and, consequently, costs...|$|R
