40|$|EN) Background: The life {{expectancy}} is defined {{by a combination of}} genotype (25 %) and environmental influences, including lifestyle (75 %). Nevertheless a stronger genetic influence is expressed in long-living individuals. Epsilon gene for apolipoprotein E (APOE) belongs among the most studied so called "candidate genes of longevity". The association of APOE polymorfism is proved in relation to many diseases (hypercholesterolaemia, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer disease), thus we tried to evaluate the relation of APOE polymorfism and senior fitness. Methods: In our pilot study we examined a total number of 128 patients (93 women, 35 men), all of them older than 80 years, average age 88. 6 ± 5. 3 years. Examinations: A) detailed examination of functional fitness (ADL, MMSE, Yeassavage's depression scale, MNA, 6 -MWT). Based on this complex examination, patients have been sorted to 5 functional categories according to W.

Four major sources of information are used: • Qualitative descriptions of pest problems and pest management practices in traditional agriculture; • Quantitative studies of pest dynamics in traditional agriculture; • Ecological studies of natural ecosystems; and • Agricultural field experiments.

40|$|Key words: crop production, maize, millet, sorghum, cotton, fertilizer, rainfall, temperature, APSIM, Mali,   In the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa (SSWA) {{agricultural}} production remains {{the main source}} of livelihood for rural communities, providing employment to more than 60 percent of the population and contributing to about 30 % of gross domestic product. Smallholder {{agricultural production}} is dominated by rain-fed production of millet, sorghum and maize for food consumption and of cotton for the market. Farmers experience low and variable yields resulting in increasing uncertainty about the ability to produce the food needed for their families. Major factors contributing to such uncertainty and low productivity are climate variability, climate change and poor agricultural management. The objective of this thesis was to evaluate through experimentation, modelling and participatory approaches the real and perceived characteristics of climate variability and change and their effects on crop production in order to identify opportunities for enhancing the adaptive capacity of farmers in the Sudano - Sahelian zone. The general approach was based on, first, understanding the past trend of climate and its effect on the yield of main crops cultivated in southern Mali; second, evaluating together with farmers different adaptation options in the field; third, evaluating climate adaptation options through experimentation on station; and fourth, evaluating the consequences of different adaptation options under different long term scenarios of climate change. Minimum daily air temperature increased on average by 0. 05 o C per year during the period from 1965 to 2005 while maximum daily air temperature remained constant. Seasonal rainfall showed large inter-annual variability with no significant change over the 1965 – 2005 period. However, the total number of dry days within the growing season increased significantly indicating a change in rainfall distribution. There was a negative effect of maximum temperature, number of dry days and total seasonal rainfall on cotton yield.   Farmers perceived an increase in annual rainfall variability, an increase in the occurrence of dry spells during the rainy season, and an increase in temperature. Drought tolerant, short maturing crop varieties and appropriate planting dates were the commonly preferred adaptation strategies to deal with climate variability. Use of chemical fertilizer enhances the yield and profitability of maize while the cost of fertilizer prohibits making profit with fertilizer use on millet. Training of farmers on important aspects of weather and its variability, and especially on the onset of the rains, is critical to enhancing adaptive capacity to climate change. A field experiment (from 2009 to 2011) indicated that for fertilized cereal crops, maize out yielded millet and sorghum by respectively 57 % and 45 % across the three seasons. Analysis of 40 years of weather data indicated that this finding holds for longer time periods than the length of this trial. Late planting resulted in significant yield decreases for maize, sorghum and cotton, but not for millet. However, a short duration variety of millet was better adapted for late planting. When the rainy season starts late, sorghum planting can be delayed from the beginning of June to early July without substantial reductions in grain yield. Cotton yield at early planting was 28 % larger than yield at medium planting and late planting gave the lowest yield with all three varieties. For all four crops the largest stover yields were obtained with early planting and the longer planting was delayed, the less stover was produced.   Analysis of predicted future climate change on cereal production indicated that the temperature will increase over time. Generally stronger increases occur in the rcp 8. 5 scenario compared to the rcp 4. 5 scenario. The total annual rainfall is unlikely to change. By mid-century predicted maize grain yield losses were 45 % and 47 % with farmer’s practice in the rcp 4. 5 and rcp 8. 5 scenarios respectively. The recommended fertilizer application did not offset the climate change impact but reduced the yield losses to 38 % of the baseline yield with farmer’s practice. For millet median yield loss was 16 % and 14 % with farmer’s practice in the rcp 4. 5 and rcp 8. 5 scenario. If the recommended fertilizer rates are applied to millet, the predicted yield losses with farmer’s practice due to climate change are reversed in both climate scenarios.   Under future climate change, food availability will be reduced for the all farm types, but that large farm will still achieve food <b>self</b> – <b>sufficiency</b> in terms of energy requirement. The medium and small farm types see a further decrease in food self-sufficiency. Addressing smallholder food self-sufficiency depends upon the capacity of each farm type to appropriately choose the planting date while taking into account the acceptable planting date window for each individual crop...|$|R

The United States' response was [...] "very different but just as deep an instinctual reaction... the United States have an almost neurotic sense of vulnerability... its two coastlines, its two theatres, its two navies are separated by the entire length of the New World... she lives with... the nightmare of having one day to fight a decisive sea battle without the benefit of concentration, the perpetual spectre of naval 'war on two fronts'." [...] Powell added: [...] "The Panama Canal from 1914 onwards could never quite exorcise the spectre.... It was the position of the Falkland Islands in relation to that route which gave and gives them their significance—for the United States above all. The British people have become uneasily aware that their American allies would prefer the Falkland Islands to pass out of Britain's possession into hands which, if not wholly American, might be amenable to American control. In fact, the American struggle to wrest the islands from Britain has only commenced in earnest now that the fighting is over". Powell then said there was [...] "the Hispanic factor": [...] "If we could gather together all the anxieties for the future which in Britain cluster around race relations... and then attribute them, translated into Hispanic terms, to the Americans, we would have something of the phobias which haunt the United States and addressed itself to the aftermath of the Falklands campaign".|$|E
