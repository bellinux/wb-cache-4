25|$|The strong anthropic {{principle}} (SAP) as explained by John D.

Some critics of the SAP argue in favor of a weak {{anthropic principle}} (WAP) similar to the one defined by Brandon Carter, which states that the universe's ostensible fine tuning is the result of selection bias (specifically survivor bias): i.e., only in a universe capable of eventually supporting life will there be living beings capable of observing and reflecting upon fine tuning. Most often such arguments draw upon some notion of the multiverse for there to be a <b>statistical</b> <b>population</b> of universes to select from and from which selection bias (our observance of only this universe, compatible with our life) could occur.|$|E

2500|$|Statistics is {{a branch}} of {{mathematics}} dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.

2500|$|The {{starting}} point for calculating life expectancy is the age-specific death rates of the population members.

2500|$|The {{criteria}} adopted {{for many}} of the mental disorders were taken from the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) and Feighner Criteria, which had just been developed by a group of research-orientated psychiatrists based primarily at Washington University in St. Louis and the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Other criteria, and potential new categories of disorder, were established by consensus during meetings of the committee, as chaired by Spitzer. A key aim was to base categorization on colloquial English descriptive language (which would be easier to use by federal administrative offices), rather than assumptions of cause, although its categorical approach assumed each particular pattern of symptoms in a category reflected a particular underlying pathology (an approach described as [...] "neo-Kraepelinian"). The psychodynamic or physiologic view was abandoned, in favor of a regulatory or legislative model. A new [...] "multiaxial" [...] system attempted to yield a picture more amenable to a <b>statistical</b> <b>population</b> census, rather than just a simple diagnosis. Spitzer argued that [...] "mental disorders are a subset of medical disorders" [...] but the task force decided on the DSM statement: [...] "Each of the mental disorders is conceptualized as a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome."

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a {{simulation}} study {{of one of the}} well-known hierarchical cluster analysis methods applied to classifying the <b>statistical</b> <b>populations.</b> In particular, the problem of clustering the univariate normal populations is studied. Two measures of the distance between <b>statistical</b> <b>populations</b> are considered: the Mahalanobis distance measure which is defined for normally distributed populations under assumption that the covariance matrices are equal and the Kullback-Leibler divergence (the so called Generalized Mahalanobis Distance) the use of which is extended on populations of any distribution. The simulation study is concerned with the set of 15 univariate normal populations, variances of which are chanched during successive steps. The aim is to study robustness of the nearest neighbour method to departure from the variance equality assumption when the Mahalanobis distance formula is applied. The differences between two cluster families, obtained for the same set of populations but with the different distance matrices applied, are studied. The distance between both final cluster sets is measured by means of the Marczewski-Steinhaus distance.
