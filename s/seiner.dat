40|$|Abstract The {{impact of}} {{fisheries}} within a Natura 2000 area in western Greece was assessed over a 12 -month period in 2007. The estimated total biomass removed annually by 307 fishing boats averaged 3503. 5 t. Purse <b>seiners,</b> beach <b>seiners</b> and trawlers took 70 % {{of the total}} landings. Purse <b>seiners,</b> contributing 3 % of the total fishing fleet, were responsible for 33 % of total biomass removed. Beach and purse <b>seiners</b> primarily caught small pelagic species, whereas trawlers and trammel netters mostly demersal species. A mismatch {{was found between the}} Common Fisheries Register (CFR) and an in situ assessment of the active fishing fleet; the number of industrial fishing boats exceeded those registered in CFR for the three administrative ports involved, and {{a large proportion of the}} CFR netters were small and effectively inactive. Fishery management measures for the recovery of an ecosystem considerably damaged by overfishing are proposed...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} obtain the catch {{frequency}} lenght of the species caught by the purse <b>seiners</b> fleet a sampling scheme was set at two main landing places. The present article covers the data collected from December 1991 to December 1993.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the fishing effort exerted by purse <b>seiners</b> on tropical tuna requires a constant monitoring {{of the changes in}} individual fishing power of purse <b>seiners</b> due to changes in vessel characteristics, fishing gears or fishing strategies. Also, since the 1990 s, increasing numbers of drifting Fish Aggregating Devices have been used by this fleet. As dFADs contribute to a reduction of search times, traditional measures of fishing effort such as search time or fishing time are inappropriate. Here, using logbook data from the French and the Spanish purse seine fleets over 2003 - 2014, the effects of purse seiners' characteristics (length, the size of the wells, period of construction) and their use of support vessels on the efficiency of purse <b>seiners</b> are analyzed with GLM models. 3 dimensions of the efficiency of purse <b>seiners</b> are analyzed: monthly catch rates, monthly frequency of fishing sets and monthly distance of fishing sets. Among others, we find that support vessels contribute to an increase in catch rates (+ 10 tons per day) and in distance between fishing set. In a second steps, the results of the GLM models are used to build 3 indexes of fishing effort that are compared to a simple monitoring of the number of EU purse <b>seiners</b> over 2003 - 2014. Ours result show that this simple index provide a biased image of the evolution of fishing effort for the purse seine fishery. Though preliminary, they indicate that the main components of fishing power should be taken into account when measuring the fishing effort of tropical tuna purse <b>seiners</b> in the Indian Ocean...|$|R

40|$|Ghanaian {{industrial}} tuna {{fisheries data}} covering the period 2006 - 2013 were analyzed following guidelines provided during the ICCAT preparatory {{meeting for the}} 2015 assessment of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus; BET). To account for differences in fishing strategy and quality of data sources available, the fleet was split between a component of large purse <b>seiners</b> and a component composed of baitboats and purse <b>seiners</b> that can collaborate at sea. First, the total Task I was derived from information on landings and logbooks {{for the first and}} second fleet components, respectively. Second, the monthly proportion of catch and spatial distribution on a 5 °x 5 ° grid were derived from logbook data with some necessary assumptions when data were missing. Third, species composition of the catch was estimated from the size samples collected onboard European purse <b>seiners</b> from fishing sets made on fish aggregating devices based on three processing areas. Bigeye represented about 15 % in the &# 8216;offshore&# 8217; area while its percentage in the catch was about 7 - 8 % in areas closer to the shore during the same period. Size samples collected by MFRD during 2006 - 2013 showed that the distribution of bigeye caught by Ghanaian vessels differed from that of European purse <b>seiners</b> on FADs...|$|R

40|$|Seabirds {{are known}} to make {{extensive}} use of fishery waste, a phenomenon that has been particularly well studied in relation to demersal fisheries, especially when operating during daylight hours. Contrarily, very {{little is known about}} the importance of predominantly nocturnal fisheries in providing feeding opportunities to seabirds. We considered the particular case of purse seining for small pelagic fish, which takes place basically at night, and assessed the significance of this fishing practice for seabirds off the Ebro Delta (NW Mediterranean). Fieldwork was conducted on board commercial purse <b>seiners</b> (nocturnal activity) in 1997 - 1998, and was complemented with observations performed on board both commercial bottom trawlers (diurnal activity; 1997 - 1998) and a research vessel (1999 - 2000). The purse seine fleet targets small clupeoids, which are attracted and concentrated by the light of a powerful lamp, and then captured using an encircling net. Purse <b>seiners</b> frequently changed fishing area, took very variable catches, and were strongly influenced by the weather. This made the fishery unattractive to most seabird species, which primarily attended purse <b>seiners</b> during the discarding process. This process took place on the way back to port after dawn (i. e. with daylight) during daylight and was quite irregular, thus attracting lower numbers of seabirds than did trawlers. The threatened Audouin's gull Larus audouinii was the only species attending purse <b>seiners</b> regularly at night, capturing live fish concentrated at the sea surface during the hauling process. This is in accordance with the specialisation of this gull in the capture of epipelagic fish at night, which seems facilitated by purse <b>seiners.</b> Indeed, the vessels would favour the direct capture of fish (illumination of the sea surface, concentration of the fish), as well as the location of the shoals (light signalling). The purse seining fishery was especially important for Audouin's gull during trawling moratoria (when trawling discards were not available) and in the non-breeding season. A simple bioenergetic model estimated that individual Audouin's gulls could obtain a mean of 669 kJ haul- 1, which would represent far more than hall of the daily energy requirements of breeding birds. Provided that Audouin's gulls feeding in a given area could attend more than one haul in a short time, birds attending purse <b>seiners</b> at night could easily meet their energy requirements. However, there was strong variability in our estimate (from 0 to 1659 kJ bird- 1 haul- 1, 95 % CI), and feeding at purse <b>seiners</b> would only sometimes be profitable for Audouin's gulls. Purse seine fisheries could be of importance for other nocturnal seabirds in other regions such as the SE Pacific, and this deserves further research. It is important to note that purse <b>seiners</b> could also be detrimental for many seabirds, through direct competition and eventual depletion of fish stocks.

40|$|The Norwegian coastal purse <b>seiners,</b> with shallow nets, have {{experienced}} difficulties in catching the herring {{due to their}} natura! behaviour being located too deep during day time and toe scattered during night time. Experiments, conducted by FTFI, have shown that scattered congregations of herring may be concentrated by underwater light. When light was switched on underneath the school, the herring immediately rose towards the surface with a speed of approximately 20 m/min.

40|$|Agreement {{was reached}} at an {{extraordinary}} NEAFC meeting in Moscow in December 1971 by Island, Norway and USSR {{of a total}} ban for 1972 on fishing for adult Norwegian spring sprawning herring, except for a restricted fishery in connection with scientific investigations. In order to trace the distribution and migration of winter herring R. V. "Johan Hjort" (6 January— 2 February and 2 — 13 March) and M. S. «Havdrøn» (10 — 20 January) were used. In addition five comercial purse <b>seiners</b> were chartered from 17 January to 11 March by the Norwegian government. Obervers from the Institute of marine research were on board two of the purse <b>seiners</b> and joint surveys were carried out throughout the season. During the surveys radio communication between ships was mantained twice a day to report the observations made. The purse <b>seiners</b> were allowed to fish for biological sampling according to instruction given by the Director of fisheries. However, no herring were recorded with sonar and echo sounder, and the purse <b>seiners</b> did not catch any herring. It was concluded that only insignificant number of adult herring approached the Norwegian coast for spawning in 1972. Occassionally spawning herring were caught by set nets at different places along the coast from Stad to Lofoten. They were mainly herring of the Norwegian spring spawning type. The investiations indicate that the spawning stock is at a very low level...|$|R
