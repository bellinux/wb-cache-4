50|$|Image {{stabilizer}} mode switch: This switch {{is found}} on many EF lenses that feature an image stabilizer, {{particularly those of}} longer focal lengths. The switch has two settings on most lenses: Mode 1 and Mode 2. The newest IS Mark II versions of certain EF super telephoto lenses (the 300mm f/2.8L, 400mm f/2.8L, 500mm f/4L, and 600mm f/4L), plus the 200-400mm f/4L IS and 100-400mm f/4-5.6L IS II, have a third <b>setting,</b> <b>Mode</b> 3. Mode 1 is normal mode, used for typical photography, where the subject does not move. Mode 2 is used for panning; this is useful for sports or wildlife photography, where the subject moves constantly and one will need to pan. Mode 3, intended to track action, is similar to Mode 2 in that it ignores panning; however, it only applies stabilization when the shutter is released—the viewfinder image is not stabilized. One should not use Mode 1 for panning as this will typically cause blurred photographs; the image stabilizer will attempt to correct for all motion, including the panning motion, but cannot do so due to the limited range of motion of the IS mechanism. Older lenses that have an image stabilizer, but do not feature this switch, are permanently in Mode 1. Some newer lenses, such as the Canon EF-S 18-200mm lens, are able to detect if they are being panned in either axis and will automatically disable the stabilization for the axis parallel to movement and therefore do not require this switch.|$|E

To make the work more efficient, TNO-FEL and FFI have joined in a programme called SWEEPOP, with the aim of developing a measure of effectiveness in TSM operation.

Objective: To review the evidence supporting the use of rFVIIa for the treatment of patients with congenital bleeding disorders. Patients and methods: English-language databases were searched in September 2009 for reports of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the ability of rFVIIa to restore hemostasis in patients with congenital bleeding disorders. Results: Eight RCTs involving 256 hemophilic patients with antibodies against coagulation factors, also known as inhibitors, were identified. The evidence supporting the use of rFVIIa in these patients was weak with regard to dose, clinical <b>setting,</b> <b>mode</b> of administration, efficacy, and adverse events, given the limited sample size of each RCT and the heterogeneity of the studies. Conclusion: The authors suggest that rFVIIa therapy in hemophilic patients with inhibitors should be based on the individual&rsquo;s ability to generate thrombin and form a clot, and not on the patient&rsquo;s weight alone. Therefore, assays for thrombin generation, such as whole-blood thromboelastography, have the potential to significantly improve the treatment of these patients.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the problem of}} proper (optimal) control over the seat allocation on flights. Given a heterogeneous fleet of aircraft types, multi-leg flights, {{a number of different}} passenger categories, and cancelations, an airline's objective is to devise an effective system which aids in setting the seat allocation targets for each category of passengers on each flight. This issue is analyzed by a number of authors in the context of economic, simulation based, probabilistic, and mathematical programming studies. We present an attempt to address this problem from the systems prospective emphasizing characteristics such as: passenger cancelations, multi-leg flights, and rolling tactical planning time horizon. Starting from a very simple network flow models for a single flight with a number of intermediate stops, a number of progressively complex models are presented. The airline flights and the seat allocation system are represented as a generalized network flow model (with gains/losses on arcs) with the objective of flow maximization (profit maximization). This modelling approach does not claim to replace the seat allocation approaches presented in Alstrup et al. (1985), Mayer (1976), Richter (1982), Simpson (1985 a), and Wang (1983), but rather construct seat allocations utilizing some of those referenced schemes in a parameter <b>setting</b> <b>mode</b> for a large network model. The objective of this paper is not to report on computational experiments, but to present a modeling approach which seems to be promising, if somewhat speculative. ...|$|E
40|$|The present work is {{concerned}} with exploring the potential of refractive index-based imaging techniques for investigating the heat transfer characteristics of impinging turbulent synthetic jets. The line-of-sight images of the convective field have been recorded using a Mach Zehnder interferometer. Heat transfer experiments have been conducted in infinite fringe <b>setting</b> <b>mode</b> of the interferometer with air as the working fluid. The effect of the excitation frequency of the synthetic jet on the resultant temperature distribution and local heat transfer characteristics has been studied. The fringe patterns recorded {{in the form of}} interferograms have first been qualitatively discussed and thereafter, quantitatively analyzed to determine the two-dimensional temperature field. Local heat transfer coefficients along the width of the heated copper block have been determined from the temperature field distribution thus obtained from the interferograms. The results have been presented in the form of interfermetric images recorded as a function of frequency of the synthetic jet, corresponding two-dimensional temperature distributions and local variation of heat transfer coefficients. Interferometric measurements predicted maxima of the heat transfer coefficient at the resonance frequency of the synthetic jet and at a jet-to-plate surface spacing (z/d) of 3. These observations correlate well with the thermocouple-based measurements of temperature and heat transfer coefficient performed simultaneously during the experiments. The interferometry-based study, as reported in the present work {{for the first time in}} the context of synthetic jets, highlights the importance of refractive index-based imaging techniques as a potential tool for understanding the local heat transfer characteristics of synthetic jets.

40|$|Laser interferometry-based forced {{convective}} heat transfer {{experiments in the}} context of compact channels using nanofluids are reported. Experiments have been carried out under thermally-developing flow conditions for a range of Reynolds numbers. De-ionized water and alumina/water-based dilute nanofluids have been employed as the coolant medium. The nanofluid-based experiments employ three volumetric concentrations of 0. 01 %, 0. 03 % and 0. 05 %. Projection data of the convective fields have been recorded using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Phenomena such as thermal boundary layer profiles and thickness of thermal boundary layer have been interpreted based on the infinite fringe <b>setting</b> <b>mode</b> of the interferometer, while the quantitative information in the form of whole-field temperature distributions and heat transfer coefficients have been retrieved from the wedge fringe setting. Effects of increasing Reynolds numbers and volumetric concentrations of nanofluids on thermal boundary layer profiles and the resultant heat transfer rates have been investigated. Results of the experiments carried out at low Reynolds number (Re < 513) reveal that the thermal boundary layer profiles are nearly insensitive to the changes in the concentrations of dilute nanofluids, while a significant enhancement in the heat transfer coefficient is seen as the concentrations of nanofluid is increased. On other hand, at higher Reynolds numbers, increasing concentrations of dilute nanofluids leads to a considerable increase in the thickness of thermal boundary layer that is accompanied with a mild deterioration in the heat transfer rates. Based on the primary findings of the experiments, that are purely non-intrusive in nature, various plausible mechanisms that govern the heat transfer characteristics of dilute nanofluids have been discussed.
