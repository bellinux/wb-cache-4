5|$|During the French colonial administration, educated Vietnamese were {{employed}} in the civil service administration as <b>secretaries,</b> <b>clerks</b> and bureaucrats. When Cambodia gained independence in 1953, the Sihanouk-led government phased {{out most of the}} Vietnamese civil servants with Cambodians, and they sought employment in banks and commercial enterprises as secretaries and other office-based positions. In the 1960s, urban-dwelling Vietnamese with lower education backgrounds also worked as mechanics in car repair and machine shops owned by Chinese businessmen. Vietnamese immigrants that settled in the countryside worked as fishermen along the Tonle Sap lake and Mekong river, and also as rubber plantation workers in Kampong Cham and Kratie provinces.|$|E

60|$|On {{the morning}} of the 3d, the President, {{attended}} by the Secretary, received Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell on board the United States steam transport River Queen in Hampton Roads. The conference was altogether informal. There was no attendance of <b>secretaries,</b> <b>clerks,</b> or other witnesses. Nothing was written or read. The conversation, although earnest and free, was calm, and courteous, and kind on both sides. The Richmond party approached the discussion rather indirectly, and at no time did they either make categorical demands, or tender formal stipulations or absolute refusals. Nevertheless, during the conference, which lasted four hours, the several points at issue between the Government and the insurgents were distinctly raised, and discussed fully, intelligently, and in an amicable spirit. What the insurgent party seemed chiefly to favor was a postponement of the question of separation, upon which the war is waged, and a mutual direction of efforts of the Government, {{as well as those of}} the insurgents, to some extrinsic policy or scheme for a season during which passions might be expected to subside, and the armies be reduced, and trade and intercourse between the people of both sections resumed. It was suggested by them that through such postponement we might now have immediate peace, with some not very certain prospect of an ultimate satisfactory adjustment of political relations between this Government and the States, section, or people now engaged in conflict with it.|$|E

An 1834 report on the drive to reduce sinecures shows Souper taking on the dual roles of <b>Secretary</b> and <b>Clerk</b> of the Council. There were in fact three defined official roles, <b>Secretary,</b> <b>Clerk</b> and Register (or court intendant, often called escribando, a term inherited from the Spanish colonial time in Trinidad).

50|$|The Film Exchange Building {{employed}} a large office staff that included salespeople, book keepers, <b>secretaries,</b> <b>clerks</b> and typists {{in addition to}} those in the shipping and receiving departments. Also, because of the fragile nature of film stock (thin reels of celluloid played on a movie projector), there was a large staff of inspectors employed. Before being shipped to another theater, the staff of inspectors diligently inspected the entire reel for any damages consisting of tears, scratches, damaged patches, and ripped sprocket holes. Most often the damages were entirely repaired onsite, with the cost being billed to the theater returning the movie reel. Some film stock was made out of nitrate which is very flammable, so those employees working with the film operated in fireproof rooms that had self-closing fireproof doors.|$|E

50|$|Beneath the councilors {{were the}} <b>secretaries,</b> <b>clerks,</b> and {{accountants}} {{who ran the}} bureaucracy of the Duchy and adhered to a strict discipline and worked long hours. These men held no political power of their own, but often, this was the starting place for burghers looking to climb the ladder. Secretaries and clerks (Schreiber) copied and filed important documents for the various branches of the government. The growth of the central government's bureaucracy also meant the number of clerks growing from 25 in 1520 to over 80 {{by the end of}} the century. Accountants too grew in number, as the amount of bookkeepers (Buchhalter), charged with maintaining a general ledger to recording and writing summaries of votes cast in privy council meetings, would be expanded greatly to fill the needs of the government. Other low-level positions included the keeper of the treasury (Gewöhlbeverwater), who curated the goods of the treasury vault such as government archives, and the message supervisor (Botenmeister), who managed the couriers of the Duchy.|$|E
5000|$|In 1933, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of the diplomats serving in the Auswärtiges Amt came from upper-class families with a disproportionate number coming from the aristocracy. The overrepresentation of aristocrats together with its overwhelming upper-class character gave the Auswärtiges Amt an elitist cache, and made the Auswärtiges Amt into one of the most prestigious institutions in Germany. Because of its upper-class composition, the diplomats could afford extremely expensive clothes, and the men of Auswärtiges Amt were generally considered to the best dressed officials in the entire German government, contributing to the Auswärtiges Amts glamorous, stylist image. There were no female diplomats, and besides for the women employed as <b>secretaries,</b> <b>clerks</b> and cleaners, the Auswärtiges Amt had no female employees. That the men of the Auswärtiges Amt formed an elitist group can be seen that every single diplomat had a university degree (before the 1950s, most Germans did not go to university). The requirement that one had to have a university degree to enter the Auswärtiges Amt effectively guaranteed upper-class dominance of the Auswärtiges Amt.|$|E
50|$|Charles W. Ferguson {{founded the}} National Independence Day Festival and Parade {{and served as}} its {{executive}} director. Mr. Ferguson registered the NIDFP as a non-profit organization, and received financial support for the celebration from industrial heads in the Washington D.C. area. After receiving permission from the National Park Service to hold the parade along Constitution Avenue, the first National Independence Day Parade was held July 4, 1981. The parade consisted of various entities: high school marching bands, military bands, theatrical and other musical groups, foreign performing groups, national and international honoraries, and even Miss America and Miss Universe. Jerry D. Harvey, of Bountiful, Utah, served as the initial International Director of the parade from 1981 to 1983. His duties consisted of finding national and international performing groups for the NIDFP. After 1983, this position was passed on to Kenneth C. Madsen. Sandra Meadows was an important facet of the organization, annually arranging the airline travel {{for most of the}} participating groups, VIP guests, and other parade committee members. The parade committee of the NIDFP was composed of parade judges, <b>secretaries,</b> <b>clerks,</b> technical support, travel agents, tour guides, etc. The last NIDFP parade was held on July 4, 1993. The organization could not meet the financial demands required to continue its activities. Fears of terrorism stemming from the Persian Gulf War and Desert Storm led to bands and other performing groups dropping out of the parade and festival, decline in tourism and airline travel, and the ultimate termination of the NIDFP and its participation in 4 July festivities. Another factor leading to the organization's demise was the increase of fees imposed by the National Park Service to hold the parade.|$|E
