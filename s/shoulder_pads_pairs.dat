40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the adoption of}} the <b>shoulder</b> <b>pad</b> in female, western fashion. <b>Shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> are essentially a form of wadding inserted into a garment that alters the natural shape of the shoulder line. They can give the illusion of a much broader shoulder, a square shoulder or a rounded, softer shoulder. In bespoke or made-to measure fashion such as tailoring and haute couture, the use of <b>shoulder</b> <b>padding</b> can also align the shoulders if one slopes more than the other. The fashion industry has utilzed <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> to enhance the silhouette of many types of clothes and this research aims to trace the history of <b>shoulder</b> <b>padding</b> in contemporary fashion, from the early 1930 s. It also discusses how technology has developed the use of <b>shoulder</b> <b>padding</b> in female fashion. Their inclusion in fashionable clothing depends on the fashion taste of the day however the research also investigates how <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> have sometimes been appropriated by women in order to galvanize an impression of power and emancipation...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> {{consist of}} a hard plastic outer shell with {{shock-absorbing}} foam padding underneath. The pads fit over the shoulders and the chest and rib area, and are secured with various snaps and buckles. <b>Shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> give football players their typical [...] "broad-shouldered" [...] look, and are fitted to an adult player by measuring across the player's back from shoulder blade to shoulder blade with a soft cloth measuring tape and then adding 1/2 inch. For comfort, <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> are sometimes worn {{in conjunction with a}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> cushion of foam rubber over a cotton half-tee.|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 21st Century (2000-2010), a {{resurgence}} of <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> appeared on many runways, fashion designer collections and a revival of 1980s trends became mainstream among many people who were interested in them. By the 2009-2010 seasons, <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> had made their way back into the mainstream market. In 2010 many retailers like Wal-Mart had <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> on at least half of all women's tops and blouses.|$|R
50|$|As {{the decade}} wore on, <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> became the {{defining}} fashion {{statement of the}} era, known as power dressing and bestowing the perception of status and position onto those who wore them. They became both larger and more ubiquitous—every garment from the brassiere upwards would come with {{its own set of}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads.</b> To prevent excessive <b>shoulder</b> <b>padding,</b> velcro was sewn onto the pads so that the wearer could choose how many sets to wear. By the end of the era, some <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> were the size of dinner plates. It was inevitable that as the cycle of fashion turned, they would lose favour in the early 1990s.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> {{made their}} next {{appearance}} in women's clothing {{in the early}} 1970s, through the influence of British fashion designer Barbara Hulanicki and her label Biba. Biba produced designs influenced by the styles of the 1930s and 1940s, and so a soft version of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>pad</b> was revived. Ossie Clark was another London designer using <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> at the time. These styles did not, however, reach mainstream acceptance, and so the popularity was relatively short lived.|$|R
50|$|By the 1950s, <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> {{appeared}} only in {{jackets and}} coats—not in dresses, knitwear or blouses {{as they had}} previously during {{the heyday of the}} early 1940s. By the early 1960s, these slowly became less noticeable and midway through the decade, <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> had disappeared.|$|R
50|$|The <b>shoulder</b> <b>pad</b> fashion {{carried over}} from the late 1980s with some {{popularity}} in the early 1990s, but the wearer's tastes were changing due to the backlash against 1980s culture. Some designers continued to produce ranges featuring <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> into the mid-1990s, as <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> were prominent in women's formal suits, and matching top-bottom attire, highly exampled in The Nanny. But as the decade wore on, the styles were outdated and were shunned by young and fashion-conscious wearers. Appearances were reduced to smaller, subtler versions augmenting the shoulder lines of jackets and coats.|$|R
50|$|The early 2010s {{have also}} seen the {{resurgence}} of <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads.</b> Many young women had imitated artists such as Lady Gaga and Rihanna, who {{are known for their}} 1980s style jackets with <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads,</b> and the new wave styles of the 1980s have continued resurgence in mainstream fashion in the mid-2010s.|$|R

40|$|Cyclist {{injuries}} {{leading to}} long-term consequences are common and therefore important to address {{in order to}} design a more sustainable road transport system. Previous research shows that of all impairing injuries, almost 50 % were to the upper extremities. The most common in-juries to the upper extremities leading to medical impairment were to the shoulder and the wrist. In 90 % of the cases the injury to the shoulder resulted from a fall onto the <b>shoulder.</b> <b>Shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> could be a possible solution {{to reduce the number}} and severity of the injuries. The aim of the present work was to investigate the potential effectiveness of shoulder protec-tion. To validate the possible effectiveness of <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> a comparison between the responses of a finite element model (THUMS) with and without <b>shoulder</b> <b>pad</b> was made. A fall from 1. 3 m with a shoulder impact was simulated. To evaluate the effect of an existing <b>shoulder</b> <b>pad</b> aimed for downhill cycling a crash test with a crash test dummy (WorldSID) was conducted. The WorldSID was impacted in three different set ups: with, without <b>shoulder</b> <b>pad</b> and with a prototype shoulder airbag. The simulations showed that the maximum stress (von Mises) in the clavicle was reduced by 7 % when a <b>shoulder</b> <b>pad</b> was used (138 MPa without and 129 MPa with pad). The crash tests show that the shoulder airbag compared to <b>shoulder</b> <b>pad</b> was more effective in reducing the impact force. This reduction in force corresponds to a seven times lower shoulder injury risk. Results show that a protective device for the shoulder has the potential to reduce risk of shoulder injuries...|$|R

50|$|<b>Shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> are {{a type of}} fabric-covered padding used in men's and women's {{clothing}} to give the wearer the illusion of having broader and less sloping shoulders. In men's styles, <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> are often used in suits, jackets and overcoats, usually sewn {{at the top of}} the shoulder and fastened between the lining and the outer fabric layer. In women's clothing, their inclusion depends by the fashion taste of the day. Although from a non-fashion point of view they are generally for people with narrow or sloping shoulders, there are also quite a few cases in which <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> will be necessary for a suit or blazer in order to compensate for certain fabrics' natural properties, most notably suede blazers, due to the weight of the material. They were popular additions to clothing (particularly business clothing) during the 1940s, 1980s, and late 2000s/2010s.|$|R
