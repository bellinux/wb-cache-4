In summary, there are 11 mills and approximately 475 farms in Louisiana. The National Agricultural Statistics Service ([URL] provide zip-code level addresses for 456 farms, and The American Sugar League ([URL] provides exact addresses of the 11 mills. We also have the county level data on sizes of the farms that puts them into buckets of various sizes ([URL] First, we calculate the distances between the farms and the mills. Then, we randomly assign the sizes for the individual farms according to the distribution of farm sizes in the respective counties. We then assume that farms that harvest more than 750 acres of cane a year have two combine harvesters and the ones that harvest less than 750 acres have one combine harvester. This harvester distribution is motivated by the fact Salassi and Barker (2008) found the average number of combines to be 1. 5. Each combine harvester takes approximately 45 minutes to fill a load. So, the time to harvest a load in the farm with one harvester is 45 minutes plus a small random component (chosen from uniform random between negative 5 and positive 5) and the time to harvest a load in the farm with two harvesters is 22. 5 minutes plus a small random component (chosen from uniform random between negative 2. 5 and positive 2. 5) (Barker 2007, Salassi and Barker 2008). Each row of each of the files represents a farm. For each farm, there are three columns of data. The columns are the distance to the mill from the farm, the inter-harvest time, and the number of loads to be supplied by the farm. The inter-harvest time is the amount of time needed to harvest one load at the farm. References Francis G. Barker.

40|$|Resumo: No Brasil, a agroindústria canavieira processa 318 milhões de toneladas de cana-de-açúcar por ano (UNICA, 2003). Atualmente, de 5 a 15 % desta matéria-prima é perdida no campo, quando o corte é feito manual ou mecanizado respectivamente, representando um prejuízo da ordem de US$ 450 milhões por ano. Devido a lei governamental n° 11. 241 de 19 / 09 / 2002, o corte tende a tornar-se apenas de cana crua, sem queimar, inviabilizando o corte manual. Desta forma, as perdas devem permanecer próximas do último valor. Este trabalho parte da hipótese de que é possível desenvolver alternativas tecnológicas, como o aprimoramento dos componentes e sistemas das colhedoras de cana-de-açúcar picada, para minimizar este desperdício. Pretendeu-se, inicialmente, quantificar as perdas impossíveis de serem levantadas diretamente no campo (perdas invisíveis), já que as perdas visíveis são conhecidas, e a incidência de matéria estranha na cana processada pelas colhedoras de cana picada. Mantendo-se as colhedoras sob condições controladas, os ensaios foram realizados em um galpão de manutenção de máquinas da Usina São João/Araras-SP e na oficina de protótipos agrícolas do Centro de Tecnologia da Copersucar-CTC, de janeiro/ 1997 a março/ 2000. As colhedoras, que permaneceram estacionárias, foram alimentadas por uma esteira rolante acionada pelo motor hidráulico. Nos ensaios de perdas invisíveis foram utilizadas, inicialmente, canas limpas, desfolhadas e despontadas e depois canas com folhas e pontas. Para a determinação das impurezas vegetais na carga, foram processados colmos integrais, com folhas e ponteiros, simulando a condição adversa de canavial tombado. Por meio da análise dos dados quantificados nos ensaios de cana com palha, concluiu-se que as perdas invisíveis nos sistemas das colhedoras variaram de 2 a 11 %, e são maiores na cana com maior teor de fibra e mais torta e na cana com palha em relação à cana sem palha. A eficiência de limpeza da matéria-prima ficou entre 74 % na base matéria seca, para a velocidade angular de rotação das pás do extrator primário de 1000 rpm e 89 % para a velocidade de 1200 rpm. Os resultados apontaram que o fluxo de massa de cana que alimenta a colhedora não tem influência nas {{magnitudes}} das perdas invisíveis totais de cana e na eficiência de limpeza na matéria-prima. Baseado nos resultados obtidos na primeira fase, na segunda etapa apresentou-se 4 propostas para a regulagem, ajustes e o aperfeiçoamento dos componentes das colhedoras. A primeira proposta foi verificar a possibilidade de utilização de uma mini-câmera para ser instalada junto ao disco de corte de base para auxiliar o operador da colhedora no controle da altura de corte. A segunda proposta avaliada foi a eficiência de um novo mecanismo de controle de altura do corte de base flutuante, capaz de acompanhar as ondulações do terreno. Observou-se, durante as safras 1999 / 2000, 2000 / 2001 e 2001 / 2002, que o mecanismo avaliado é eficiente, robusto e que oferece uma rápida resposta na altura requerida. Os resultados obtidos nos testes de campo, indicam que o corte de base flutuante tem um desempenho melhor que o convencional. Demonstram que o índice de impureza mineral na carga, a quantidade de soqueiras arrancadas e de perdas visíveis no campo são menores quando a colhedora trabalha em cana comercial equipada com o conjunto corte basal flutuante. O trabalho, também, avaliou a possibilidade de se utilizar um material alternativo (ferro fundido branco) para as facas dos rolos picadores em substituição ao padrão aço mola, visando, sem sucesso, aumentar a resistência ao desgaste e ao impacto destas peças. A quarta proposta foi o uso de um monitor de perdas instalado no extrator primário da colhedora. Avaliou-se o desempenho deste monitor trabalhando no campo e quantificando as perdas visíveis de cana e a eficiência de limpeza do extrator primário em relação a variação da rotação do ventilador. Utilizou-se para monitorar as perdas um sensor piezoelétrico que apresentou boa sensibilidade aos impactos contra o capuz do extrator primário. Observou-se também uma boa correlação entre os dados de eficiência de limpeza e perdas com os valores registrados pelo monitor. Assim, o presente trabalho visa reduzir os custos do processamento de cana minimizando as perdas e melhorando o desempenho das colhedoras de cana picada, aumentando a competitividade do setor. Abstract: The Brazilian {{sugar cane}} industry crashes 318 millions tones of sugarcane a year. Nowadays, from 5 to 15 % this raw material {{is lost in}} the field, when the harvesting is done by hand or mecanized respectively, given a damage about US$ 450 millions a year, since only 15 % is mechanical harvested. Due to a environmental government law green cane harvesting will be compulsory, in few years, so the losses must be keeping nearly the last number. The hipotesis for this work {{is that it is}} possible to make use of technologicals alternatives, to improve the components and internals systems to process raw material inside the sugar cane chopped harvesters, to minimize this waste. The purpose of this research was to determine the invisible losses (which are impossible to be located in the field) because the visible losses are already known, and the incidence of vegetable impurities (harvester primary extractor’s cleanliness efficiency) in the sugarcane processed by chopper harvesters. Trials carried out under controlled conditions at the maintenance workshop of São João Sugar mill (Araras-SP) and at the agricultural prototypes workshop of Centro de Tecnologia Copersucar (Piracicaba-SP), from January / 1997 till march/ 2000. The harvesters, which stayed stationary, were fed by a conveyor driven by a hydraulic motor. For the tests of invisible losses clean cane whithout leaves, straw and tops was used first, afther that, the wholestalks were processed with leaves and tops, also to determine vegetable impurities in the load, simulating adverse condition of lodged cane crop. The pneumatic cleaning systems velocity, extractors in the harvesters, affected the magnitude of invisible losses and the amount of vegetable impurities in the load. The largest invisible losses in the cane processed by the harvesters occured due to choppers and base cutter waste knives and they were higher at the primary extrator followed by the base cutter in all over the components and internals systems of the harvesters. The harvester had higher invisible losses in cane with leaves than in cane whithout leaves, and they were highest in the hard cane (higher fibre) and lodged and tangled cane. The values of invisible losses and incidence of amount of vegetable impurities (harvester primary extractor’s cleanliness efficiency) in the load, due to the different adjustments of pneumatic cleaning systems of the harvesters, are analysed and discussed in this work. Based on the first step data, it intends on the second step to show four proposals to set up, to adjust and to improve the harvester’s components. First of all, this work want to verify to use of a mini camera helping the harvesters’ operators control the base cutter’s height. At the beginning of this research a novel system for controlling base cutter cutting height was designed and manufactured in an attempt to improve the performance of commercial <b>sugarcane</b> chopper <b>harvesters.</b> The system differed from previous attempts to control base cutter height by suspending the base cutter gearbox and associated components as a discrete module incorporating a passive height control system. The advantages offered by this system include the potential for rapid response to cutting height requirements, the elimination of the secondary effects of base cutter height adjustments on topper height setting and, being fully mechanical, the system does not require additional hydraulic or mechanical control. This paper reviews the results of a testing programme undertaken on the floating base cutter system during the 1999 / 2000, 2000 / 2001 and 2001 / 2002 harvesting seasons with machines working in commercial cane fields. The results of the trial programme indicated that the mineral trash levels in loads transported from field to mill were consistently lower from machines fitted with the floating base cutter system relative to standard machines. The amounts of butts left in the field, of roots and stools removed from the field were also lower with the floating base cutter, however, under the conditions of the tests, statistical significance was not achieved. At the end, this research want to assess the chopper knives made of alternative material (white cast iron) to minimize the wearing and breaking by impacts, and it checks the Cane Loss Monitor working on primary extractor aimed to reduce raw material losses and improve the cleanliness of the cane load to the mill The proposed work aims to reduce the sugar cane processed costs minimizing the losses and improves to the chopped harvesters performance...|$|R

Questões econômicas, ambientais e sociais induzem à mecanização da colheita, o que pode proporcionar melhores condições de trabalho e o aproveitamento da palha, com a eliminação da queima prévia. Parte da palha pode ser utilizada para cobertura do solo, melhorando o reciclo de nutrientes, a retenção de água e redução da erosão. Outra parte da palha poderá ser recolhida, enviada para a indústria e utilizada para geração de eletricidade e/ou para produção de etanol de 2 ª geração. Este trabalho, com auxílio da Biorrefinaria Virtual de Cana-de-açúcar (BVC/CTBE), empregou as metodologias de insumo-produto e análise de ciclo de vida (ACV) para analisar os impactos socioeconômicos e ambientais do recolhimento e aproveitamento da palha de cana-de-açúcar no setor sucroenergético, considerando (i) a tecnologia de colheita existente (colhedora Convencional) e em desenvolvimento (Estrutura de Tráfego Controlado ¿ ETC, proposta de mecanização com redução e controle do tráfego), (ii) a parcela de palha recolhida, (iii) a forma de recolhimento e transporte e (iv) seu uso. Avaliou-se, também, a viabilidade econômica de cada rota tecnológica considerada. Verificou-se que a colheita integral é economicamente vantajosa na fase agrícola e que a redução da densidade de carga pode ser compensada com menor perda de colmos, devido à redução de potência dos extratores da colhedora. O enfardamento apresenta custos elevados para pequenas frações de recolhimento devido à redução na capacidade operacional das máquinas. A análise do modelo verticalizado de produção (fase agrícola e industrial) mostrou que a baixa eficiência da estação de limpeza a seco interfere diretamente nos rendimentos da indústria, diminuindo a vantagem da colheita integral. A proposta de recolher palha através de colheita integral com palha repicada apresentou bons resultados nas simulações, reduzindo o custo de transporte e melhorando a eficiência de separação da palha na indústria. Considerando o modelo verticalizado de produção, fardos 7, 5 t/ha (com colhedora convencional) e Integral sem ponteiro repicada (ETC) apresentam maiores valores para TIR, 12, 0 % e 14, 2 %, respectivamente. A fase agrícola responde por 80 % a 90 % dos impactos ambientais, variando de acordo com o cenário e a categoria de impacto analisada. O uso e produção de fertilizantes e corretivos são os itens que mais ocasionam os impactos ambientais, seguidos de uso de óleo diesel. Em termos socioeconômicos, a colheita integral apresenta maior valor de produção e PIB; já os cenários com fardos apresentam maior remuneração mensal média por emprego e número de empregos gerados em função do maior número de operações mecanizadas demandando mais mão de obra. O resultado principal do estudo mostra que os cenários com ETC apresentam maior eficiência econômica e a proposta de recolhimento através de colheita integral com palha sem ponteiro e repicada apresentou maior atratividade econômica com menores impactos ambientais. Esta pesquisa demonstra a importância de desenvolvimento de tecnologias que permitam melhor aproveitamento da biomassa. Harvesting {{of green}} sugarcane, without burning, has been imposed mainly by {{environmental issues and}} aiming {{to take full advantage}} of sugarcane. Economic, environmental and social issues induce mechanical harvesting, which can provide better working conditions and the use of straw, with the elimination of the previous burning. Part of the straw can be used for soil coverage, enhancing the recycling of nutrients, water retention and reducing erosion. Another part of the straw can be collected, sent to the industry and used for bioelectricity generation or production of 2 nd generation ethanol. This paper, with the support of Virtual Sugarcane Biorefinery (VSB), applied input-output and life cycle analysis methodologies to analyze the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of collection and utilization of straw sugarcane, considering (i) harvesting of <b>sugarcane</b> existing (conventional <b>harvester)</b> and developing (ETC - Controlled Traffic Structure ¿ proposed mechanization of reduction and traffic control) technologies, (ii) fraction of gathered straw, (iii) form of collection and transportation and (iv) use of straw. It was also evaluated economic viability of each technological route considered. It was found that the integral harvest system is economically advantageous in the agricultural phase, and that the load density reduction is almost matched with lower loss of stalks due to the reduced power of the harvesters¿ exhauster. The baling system shows higher costs of small fractions straw recovery due to reduction of the machines operational capacity. The verticalized production model analysis (agricultural and industry fases) showed that the low efficiency of dry cleaning station directly interferes with the industry output, reducing the advantage of the integral harvest system. The proposal to collect straw through integral harvest with chopping presented good results in simulations, reducing the cost of transport of straw and improving industrial productivity with better separation of straw. Considering the verticalized production model, 7, 5 ton/ha baling (with conventional harvester) and integral harvest system chopped without tops (ETC) present higher values of IRR, 12, 0 % and 14, 2 %, respectively. Regarding environmental impacts, it was found that agricultural phase represents 80 % ¿ 90 % of the environmental impacts, varying according to the analyzed scene and the impact category. The use and production of fertilizers and soil correctors are the items that cause the most environmental impacts followed by the use of diesel. In socioeconomic terms the integral harvest system presents higher production value and GDP (Gross Domestic Product); the baling scenes present higher average monthly income per job and number of generated jobs due to higher number of mechanized operations requiring more manpower. The main result of this study shows that ETC scenes present higher economic efficiency and the recovery proposal of integral harvest system chopped without tops presented higher economic prospects with lower environmental impacts. This paper shows the importance of technology development which permits better use of biomass...|$|R

40|$|Background The remarkably {{efficient}} {{mechanisms of}} the human body to maintain its core temperature of 37 °C can be inadequate when harsh climatic conditions and excessive muscle movement lead to heat stress, dehydration and potential heat illness, ranging from minor symptoms such as fatigue to a potentially fatal heat stroke. Agricultural workers in the tropics are at high risk, which is expected to increase with climate change. Sugarcane harvesting in Costa Rica is largely done by cutting the cane with a machete, by temporary, sub-contracted workers who are often migrants and living in poverty. Sugarcane harvesters are known to be affected by an epidemic of chronic kidney disease of non-traditional origin, currently hypothesized to be related to working conditions. Objectives This work aimed to better understand and document <b>sugarcane</b> <b>harvester</b> exposure to heat and the health consequences of working under such conditions. Specific objectives were to 1) Document working conditions and heat in the Costa Rican sugarcane industry (Paper I); 2) Quantify heat stress exposures faced by sugarcane harvesters in Costa Rica (Paper II); and 3) Quantify the occurrence of heat stress symptoms and abnormal urinary parameters in sugarcane workers in Costa Rica (Papers III and IV). Methods This study took place over three harvests following a pilot assessment prior to the first harvest. Methods included direct observation, semi-structured interviews with 24 individuals and a participatory workshop with 8 harvesters about heat-related perceptions, exposures and coping strategies during the harvest and non-harvest season (Pilot). Researchers accompanied workers in the field during all three harvests, measured wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and conducted direct observation. Heat exposure assessment was conducted by calculating metabolic load, WBGT and corresponding limit values based on international guidelines (NTP and OSHA) (Harvest 1). Self-reported symptom data were collected using orally-administered questionnaires from 106 sugarcane harvesters and 63 non-harvesters from the same company (Harvest 2). Chi-square test and gamma statistic were used to evaluate differences in self-reported symptoms and trends over heat exposure categories. Finally, liquid consumption during the work shift was documented and urinalysis was conducted pre-and post-shift in 48 sugarcane harvesters on three days; differences were assessed with McNemar´s test on paired proportions (Harvest 3). Results Sugarcane workers in both the harvest and non-harvest seasons are exposed to heat, but particularly during the harvest season. Field workers have to carry their own water to the field and often have no access to shade. Some plantworkers are also exposed to intense heat. The metabolic load of sugarcane harvesting was determined to be 261 W/m 2. The corresponding threshold value is 26 ◦C WBGT, above which workers should decrease work load or take breaks to avoid the risk of heat stress. Harvesters in this study were at risk of heat stress as early as 7 : 15 am on some mornings and by 9 : 00 am on all mornings. After 9 : 15 am, OSHA recommendations would require that harvesters only work at full effort 25 % of each hour to avoid heat stress. Heat and dehydration symptoms at least once per week were experienced significantly more frequently among harvesters than non-harvesters (p 30 mg/dL, and blood, leucocytes and casts in urine were also significantly different between pre and post-shift samples at the group level, but unlike USG and pH, these alterations were more frequent in the pre-shift sample. 85 % of workers presented with proteinuria at least once and 52 % had at least one post-shift USG indicative of dehydration. Conclusion Heat exposure is an important occupational health risk for sugarcane workers according to international standards. A large percentage of harvesters experience symptoms consistent with heat exhaustion throughout the harvest season. Pre and post-shift urine samples demonstrate dehydration and other abnormal findings. The results of this study demonstrate an urgent need to improve working conditions for sugarcane harvesters both under current conditions and in adaptation plans for future climate change...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{performance}} of agricultural machines {{depends on the}} reliability of the equipment used, the maintenance efficiency, the operation process, the technical expertise of workers, etc. As the size and complexity of agricultural equipment continue to increase, the implications of equipment failure become even more critical. Machine failure probability is (1 -R) and R is machine reliability (Vafaei et al., 2010). Moreover, system reliability is the probability that an item will perform a required function without failure under stated conditions for a stated period of time (Billinton and Allan, 1992). Therefore, we must be able to create an appropriate compromise between maintenance methods and acceptable reliability levels. Precision failure data gathering in a farm is a worthwhile work, because these can represent a good estimate of machine reliability combining the effects of machine loading, surrounding effects and incorrect repair and maintenance. Each machine based on its work conditions, parts combinationand manufacturing process follows a failures distribution function depending on the environment where the machine work and the machine’s specifications (Meeker and Escobar, 1998). General failures distributions for contiguous data are normal, log-normal, exponential and Weibull (Shirmohamadi, 2002). Each machine can represent proportionate behavior with these functions in short or long time. Materials and methods: The study area was the Hakim Farabi agro-industry Company located 35 kilometers south of Ahvaz in Iran. Arable lands of this company are located in 31 to 31 ° 10 N latitude and 45 to 48 ° 36 E longitudes. The region has dry and warm climate. A total of 24 Austoft 7000 sugarcane chopper harvester are being used in the company. Cane harvesters were divided into 3 group consisting of old, middle aged and new. From each group, one machine was chosen. Data from maintenance reports of harvesters which have been recorded within 400 hours were used. Usually, two methods are usedfor machine reliability modeling. The first is Pareto analysis and the second is statistical modeling of failure distributions (Barabadi and Kumar, 2007). For failures distribution modeling data need to be found, that are independent and identically (iid) distributed or not. For this, trend test and serial correlation tests are used. If the data has a trend, those are not iid and its parameters are computed from the power law process. For the data that does not havea trend, serial correlation testare performed. If the correlation coefficient is less than 0. 05 the data is not iid. Therefore, its parameters reach via branching poison process or other similar methods; if the correlation coefficient is more than 0. 05, the data are iid. Therefore, the classical statistical methods will be used for reliability modeling. Trend test results are compared with statistical parameter. A test for serial correlation was also done by plotting the ith TBF against the (i- 1) th TBF, i ¼ 1; 2;...; n: If the plotted points are randomly scattered without any pattern, it can be interpreted that there is no correlation in general among the TBFs data and the data is independent. To continue, one must choose as the best fit distribution for TBF data. Few tests can be used for best fit distribution that include chi squared test and Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K-S) test. Chi squared test is not valid when the data are less than 50. Therefore, when the TBF data are less than 50, K-S test must be used. Hence, the K-S test can be used for each TBF data numbers. When the failure distribution has been determined, the reliability model may be computed by equation (2). Results and discussion: Results of trend analysis for TBF data of <b>sugarcane</b> <b>harvester</b> machines showed that the calculated statistics U for all machines was more than chi squared value that was extracted fromthe chi square table with 2 (n- 1) degrees of freedom and 5 percent level of significance. Hence, it is possible that all of the machines’ TBF data will have identically and independent distributions. For validating this hypothesis, correlation testwas performed on TBF data that verified prior results. Then, Kolmogorov- Simonov test was done on TBF data. Results showed that all three machines followed Weibull 3 parameters function, but the shape parameter was different for them. The analysis showed the shape parameter for old, middle aged and new cane harvesters was 1. 5, 1. 42 and 1. 35, respectively. Conclusions: In order to control and reduce failures and to plan and schedule the harvester operations in optimum time, machine reliability must be known. In this paper, three sugarcane harvesters were studied individually. From the trend analysis and serial correlation, it is seen thatthe assumption of identically and being independently distributed was valid for all machines’ TBF data of sugarcane chopper harvesters...|$|E
