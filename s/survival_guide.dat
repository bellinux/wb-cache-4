25|$|Interest in the survivalist {{movement}} {{peaked in}} 1999 {{in its second}} wave for that decade, triggered by Y2K fears. In the time before extensive {{efforts were made to}} rewrite computer programming codes to mitigate the possible impacts, some writers such as Gary North, Ed Yourdon, James Howard Kunstler, and Ed Yardeni anticipated widespread power outages, food and gasoline shortages, and other emergencies. North and others raised the alarm because they thought Y2K code fixes were not being made quickly enough. While a range of authors responded to this wave of concern, two of the most survival-focused texts to emerge were Boston on Y2K (1998) by Kenneth W. Royce, and Mike Oehler's The Hippy <b>Survival</b> <b>Guide</b> to Y2K.|$|E
25|$|Harold Gatty {{suggested}} that long-distance Polynesian voyaging followed the seasonal paths of bird migrations. In “The Raft Book,” a <b>survival</b> <b>guide</b> {{he wrote for}} the U.S. military during World War II, Gatty outlined various Polynesian navigation techniques Allied sailors or aviators wrecked at sea could use {{to find their way}} to land. There are some references in their oral traditions to the flight of birds and some say that there were range marks onshore pointing to distant islands in line with the West Pacific Flyway. A voyage from Tahiti, the Tuamotus or the Cook Islands to New Zealand might have followed the migration of the long-tailed cuckoo (Eudynamys taitensis) just as the voyage from Tahiti to Hawaii would coincide with the track of the Pacific golden plover (Pluvialis fulva) and the bristle-thighed curlew (Numenius tahitiensis). It is also believed that Polynesians employed shore-sighting birds as did many seafaring peoples. One theory is that they would have taken a frigatebird (Fregata) with them. These birds refuse to land on the water as their feathers will become waterlogged making it impossible to fly. When the voyagers thought they were close to land they may have released the bird, which would either fly towards land or else return to the canoe.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the direct}} method, a solar {{collector}} is {{coupled with a}} distilling mechanism and the process is carried out in one simple cycle. Solar stills of this type are described in <b>survival</b> <b>guides,</b> provided in marine survival kits, and employed in many small desalination and distillation plants. Water production by direct method solar distillation {{is proportional to the}} area of the solar surface and incidence angle and has an average estimated value of 3-4L/m2/day. [...] Because of this proportionality and the relatively high cost of property and material for construction direct method distillation tends to favor plants with production capacities less than 200m3/day.|$|R

500|$|Brooks {{designed}} World War Z {{to follow}} the [...] "laws" [...] set up in his earlier work, The Zombie <b>Survival</b> <b>Guide</b> (2003), and explained that the guide may exist in the novel's fictional universe. The zombies of The Zombie <b>Survival</b> <b>Guide</b> are human bodies reanimated by an incurable virus (Solanum), devoid of intelligence, desirous solely of consuming living flesh, and cannot be killed unless the brain is destroyed. It is said that the undead contain a black, foul pus-like liquid instead of blood. Decomposition will eventually set in, but this process takes longer than for an uninfected body and can be slowed even further by effects such as freezing. Although zombies do not tire and are {{as strong as the}} humans they infect, though they appear to be, slightly, due to lack of normal restraint, they are not slow-moving and are incapable of planning or cooperation in their attacks. Zombies usually reveal their presence by moaning.|$|E
500|$|World War Z is a {{follow-up}} to Brooks' [...] "survival manual", The Zombie <b>Survival</b> <b>Guide</b> (2003), but its tone is much more serious. It was inspired by [...] (1984) by Studs Terkel, and by the zombie films of George A. Romero. Brooks used World War Z to comment on government ineptitude and U.S. isolationism, while also examining survivalism and uncertainty. The novel was a commercial hit and was praised by most critics.|$|E

Gilbert Cruz of Entertainment Weekly gave the novel an [...] "A" [...] rating, commenting {{that the novel}} shared with great zombie stories {{the use of a}} central metaphor, describing it as [...] "an addictively readable oral history." [...] Steven H. Silver identified Brooks' international focus as the novel's greatest strength and commented favorably on Brooks' ability to create an appreciation for the work needed to combat a global zombie outbreak. Silver's only complaint was with [...] "Good-Byes"—the final chapter—in which characters get a chance to give a final closing statement. Silver felt that it was not always apparent who the sundry, undifferentiated characters were. The Eagle described the book as being [...] "unlike any other zombie tale" [...] as it is [...] "sufficiently terrifying for most readers, and not always in a blood-and-guts way, either." [...] Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club stated that the format of the novel makes it difficult for it to develop momentum, but found the novel's individual episodes gripping. Patrick Daily of the Chicago Reader said the novel transcends the [...] "silliness" [...] of The Zombie <b>Survival</b> <b>Guide</b> by [...] "touching on deeper, more somber aspects of the human condition." [...] In his review for Time Out Chicago, Pete Coco declared that [...] "ending horror to the form of alternative history would have been novel in and of itself.

500|$|When Metamorphosis Alpha was updated and {{expanded}} into Gamma World, {{it seemed the}} right time for Gygax to reintroduce Expedition to the Barrier Peaks to the public. Said Gygax, [...] "What could be more logical than to make available a scenario which blends the two role playing approaches into a single form?" [...] Gygax updated the scenario to Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD) rules, hoping it could serve as a primer on how to integrate science into one's fantasy role playing game. In 1980, the updated version was published as Expedition to the Barrier Peaks. At the time of Expedition to the Barrier Peakss release, each Dungeons & Dragons module was marked with an alphanumeric code indicating the series to which it belonged. The 32-page adventure bears the code S3 ("S" [...] for [...] "special"). The module included a 36-page book and a 32-page book, with two outer folders; {{it was one of the}} first deluxe scenario modules, and included a book of illustrations intended to be shown to the players during the game, including four color paintings. This module was included as part of the Realms of Horror abridged compilation produced in 1987. Although an article on the Wizards.com web site did provide a conversion to Future Tech, the adventure never received an official sequel and was not updated for the D version 3.5 rules (Wizards of the Coast periodically alters the rules of Dungeons & Dragons and releases a new version). [...] It was made into a novel of the same name by Roland J. Green for the Greyhawk Classics series. The adventure has also been referenced in the Nodwick comic series. Unlike the other S series adventures, Expedition to the Barrier Peaks was not included in the Dungeon <b>Survival</b> <b>Guide</b> by author Bill Slavicsek because to him it was a [...] "wonderful adventure", but not [...] "a D adventure. Once you add ray guns and power armor to the game, you have a fundamentally different experience." [...] Other products that have introduced futuristic elements into D include the adventure City of the Gods (1987) and the novel Tale of the Comet (1997).|$|E

Tendon must be treated in specific ways to function usefully for these purposes.
