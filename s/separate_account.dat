2500|$|There {{are various}} risks {{involved}} with master trusts specifically. One {{risk is that}} timing of cash flows promised to investors might be different from timing of payments on the receivables. [...] For example, credit card-backed securities can have maturities of up to 10 years, but credit card-backed receivables usually pay off much more quickly. To solve this issue these securities typically have a revolving period, an accumulation period, and an amortization period. [...] All three of these periods are based on historical experience of the receivables. During the revolving period, principal payments received on the credit card balances are used to purchase additional receivables. During the accumulation period, these payments are accumulated in a <b>separate</b> <b>account.</b> During the amortization period, new payments are passed through to the investors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Using {{a general}} multi-country {{equilibrium}} {{model with a}} multinational enterprise, this paper investigates the efficiency properties of <b>separate</b> <b>accounting</b> and formula apportionment. If governments are large, i. e. {{take into account the}} effect of their statutory tax rate on the interest rate, and maximize tax revenues, tax rates under <b>separate</b> <b>accounting</b> may be inefficiently high while tax rates under formula apportionment turn out to be inefficiently low. In case of <b>separate</b> <b>accounting</b> the tendency toward inefficiently high tax rates traces back to a negative tax base externality. In case of formula apportionment the race to the bottom is caused by positive formula and tax base externalities. This is in contrast to previous studies ignoring interest rate effects and arguing that under <b>separate</b> <b>accounting</b> there is a race to the bottom and that under formula apportionment there is a tendency toward inefficiently high tax rates due to a negative tax base externality.

The archaeologist P.V. Glob believed that these were [...] "offerings to the gods of fertility and good fortune."

The procedure was aimed at ensuring monetary stability and promoting trade development. This monetary compensation scheme was at first bilateral, but this system was limited and unwieldy because each member state had to have a <b>separate</b> <b>account</b> for each of its CARICOM trade partners and the accounts had to be individually balanced {{at the end of each}} credit period. The system became multilateral in 1977 and was called the CARICOM Multilateral Clearing Facility (CMCF). The CMCF was supposed to favour the use of internal CARICOM currencies for transaction settlement and to promote banking cooperation and monetary cooperation between member states. Each country was allowed a fixed credit line and initially the CMCF was successful enough that both the total credit line and the credit period were extended by 1982. However, the CMCF failed shortly thereafter in the early 1980s due to Guyana's inability to settle its debts and Barbados being unable to grant new payment terms ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the courts}} have had {{difficulty}} in defining appropriate principles for cases where trusts are declared over property that many people have an interest in. This is especially true where the person who possesses that property has gone insolvent. In Re Kayford Ltd a mail order business went insolvent and customers who had paid for goods wanted their money back. Megarry J held that because Kayford Ltd had put its money in a <b>separate</b> <b>account</b> the money was held on trust, and so the customers were not unsecured creditors. By contrast in Re London Wine Co (Shippers) Ltd Oliver J held that customers who had bought wine bottles were not entitled to take their wine because no particular bottles had been identified for a trust to arise. A similar view was expressed by the Privy Council in Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd, where the customers of an insolvent gold bullion reserve business {{were told that they}} never had been given particular gold bars, and so were unsecured creditors. These decisions were said to be motivated by the desire to not undermine the statutory priority system in insolvency, although it is not entirely clear why those policy reasons extended to consumers who are usually seen as [...] "non-adjusting" [...] creditors. However, in the leading Court of Appeal decision, Hunter v Moss, there was no insolvency issue. There, Moss had declared himself to be a trustee of 50 out of 950 shares he held in a company, and Hunter sought to enforce this declaration. Dillon LJ held that it did not matter that the 50 particular shares had not been identified or isolated, and they were held on trust. The same result was reached, however, in an insolvency decision by Neuberger J in the High Court, called Re Harvard Securities Ltd, where clients of a brokerage company were held to have had an equitable property interest in share capital held for them as a nominee. The view that appears to have been adopted is that if assets are [...] "fungible" [...] (i.e. swapping them with other will not make much difference) a declaration of trust can be made, so long as the purpose of the statutory priority rules in insolvency are not compromised.|$|E

40|$|Would the {{introduction}} of a corporate tax system with consolidated tax base and formula apportionment lead to socially wasteful mergers and acquisitions across borders? This paper analyzes a two-country model with an international investor considering acquisitions of already existing target firms in a high-tax country and a low-tax country. The investor is able to shift profits from one location to another for tax saving purposes. Two systems of corporate taxation are compared, a system with <b>separate</b> <b>accounting</b> and a system with tax base consolidation and formula apportionment. It is shown that, under <b>separate</b> <b>accounting,</b> the number of acquisitions is inefficiently ciently high in both the high tax and the low tax country. Under formula apportionment, the number of acquisitions is inefficiently ciently high in the low tax country and inefficiently ciently low in the high tax country.
