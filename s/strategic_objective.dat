5|$|The port of Antwerp was an {{important}} <b>strategic</b> <b>objective</b> because Allied supply lines were heavily stretched and needed a deep-sea port near the front lines. The British Second Army liberated Antwerp on September 6, {{with help from the}} local resistance. Despite taking control of the city, the port was not accessible until the surrounding waters were safe for cargo ships. The Germans successfully denied access to the port until the Battle of the Scheldt completed in November.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{had made}} a big effort to {{reinforce}} Army Group South, and transferred Field Marshal Fedor von Bock, former commander of Army Group Center during Operation Barbarossa and Operation Typhoon. On 5 April 1942, Hitler issued Directive 41, which made the south the main area of operations under Case Blue, the summer campaign, {{at the expense of}} the other fronts. The divisions of Army Group South were brought up to full strength in late April and early May. The <b>strategic</b> <b>objective</b> was illustrated after the victories of Erich von Manstein and the 11th Army in the Crimea. The main objective remained the Caucasus, its oil fields and as a secondary objective, the city of Stalingrad.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{traditional}} Israeli historiography, Arab {{sources in}} general {{do not see}} it as {{a turning point in the}} war. They agree that the Egyptian declarations regarding Tel Aviv as the main <b>strategic</b> <b>objective</b> were ostentatious rather than operative. In his book 1948, New Historian Benny Morris also disagrees with the traditional Israeli view, and states that portraying the operation as the catalyst for the Egyptian halt is a mistake. However, in a March 15, 2007 panel of historians, Morris said that at least in the Egyptian expeditionary force, the Israeli attack did lead to a decision to stop advancing.|$|E

5|$|On 1 August 1940, Adolf Hitler {{had issued}} Führer Directive no. 17 (Weisung Nr. 17); the <b>strategic</b> <b>objective</b> {{of which was}} to engage and defeat the Royal Air Force (RAF) so as to achieve air superiority in {{preparation}} for Operation Sea Lion (Unternehmen Seelöwe), the proposed amphibious invasion of Great Britain. Reichsmarschall (Marshal of the Realm) Hermann Göring, {{in his role as}} commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe ordered an attack on RAF Fighter Command's ground organization, code named Adlertag (Operation Eagle Attack). On 13 August, 485 bomber and approximately 1,000 fighter sorties were flown, targeting British airfields in southern England. Lützow claimed his first aerial victory in the Battle of Britain on 16 August 1940, shooting down a Supermarine Spitfire over Kent.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle is}} often {{described}} as the first major battle of the war in the Pacific in which Allied troops decisively defeated Japanese land forces. Although Japanese land forces had experienced local setbacks elsewhere in the Pacific earlier in the war, unlike at Milne Bay, these actions had not forced them to withdraw completely and abandon their <b>strategic</b> <b>objective.</b> Nor did they have such a profound impact upon the moral aspect of the war. Milne Bay showed the limits of Japanese capability to expand using relatively small forces in the face of increasingly larger Allied troop concentrations and command of the air. As a result of the battle, Allied morale was boosted and Milne Bay was developed into a major Allied base, which was used to mount subsequent operations in the region.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{operations}} {{in what would}} become the Battle of Britain began for his unit on 12 July 1940. The fighting reached a climax on 7 August when Eagle Day was launched (code name Adlertag). Hitler had issued Führer Directive no. 17 (Weisung Nr. 17) on 1 August 1940; the <b>strategic</b> <b>objective</b> was to engage and defeat the Royal Air Force (RAF) to achieve air supremacy, or at least air superiority, in preparation for Operation Sea Lion (Unternehmen Seelöwe), the proposed amphibious invasion of Great Britain. From 7 September onwards, the Luftwaffe switched to attack British towns and cities, with London coming under particularly heavy attack, during what was dubbed The Blitz by the British. In total, Philipp flew 130 missions over England. His number of aerial victories increased, including his 12th to 15th on 27 September, which led to the presentation of the Honor Goblet of the Luftwaffe on 28 September 1940. He claimed his 20th victory on 20 October, and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. He was the second pilot of JG54 to receive this award. The first was his Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) Hauptmann Dietrich Hrabak, who received the award one day earlier.|$|E

40|$|The study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the <b>strategic</b> <b>objectives</b> of foreign firms entering international joint ventures, foreign parent control, and joint venture performance in the context of Sino-European IJVs. Using an integrative approach, this study incorporates market power, transaction costs, and organisational learning theories which provide a more comprehensive understanding of IJV <b>strategic</b> <b>objectives.</b> The findings reveal that foreign partners consider market-developing and knowledge-acquiring objectives as important and IJV performance in relation to these objectives as satisfactory. This study found different categories of objectives perform differently in IJVs. The relationship between parent control and IJV overall performance received strong support. Direct and indirect relationships between <b>strategic</b> <b>objectives</b> and IJV overall performance are found. The empirical evidence confirms the significant moderating effects of parent control on attainment of <b>strategic</b> <b>objectives.</b> The moderating effects of parent control do not merely intensify or weaken {{the relationship between}} <b>strategic</b> <b>objectives</b> and satisfaction in relation to these objectives, but also parent control has different moderating effects in relation to different <b>strategic</b> <b>objectives.</b> Research in international joint ventures is often associated with financial problems because of geographical constraints.

25|$|The British {{government}} had long deliberated {{about the best}} place for the landing of the Anglo-Russian expedition on the Dutch coast. Possible locations taken into consideration were the Scheldt estuary (where in 1809 the Walcheren Campaign was aimed at) and the area around Scheveningen (near The Hague) where the planners expected support from partisans of the former stadtholder, William V, Prince of Orange. Eventually, it was decided however, to select the extreme northern part of the North Holland peninsula, because its shore was more easily accessible than other parts of the Dutch coast, that were encumbered with dangerous shoals and sandbanks; because it was only lightly defended, with only a few shore batteries at Den Helder; and because it offered the hope of capturing the northern squadron of the Batavian fleet, a most important <b>strategic</b> <b>objective.</b> Also, the British planners thought that the great city of Amsterdam could easily be approached and captured from this direction.|$|E
