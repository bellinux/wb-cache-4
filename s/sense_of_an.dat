Along with a carnivorous killer on the sea, Amity is populated with equally predatory humans: the mayor has ties with the mafia, an adulterous housewife, criminals among the tourists.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Ending is a 2011 novel {{written by}} British author Julian Barnes. The book is Barnes' {{eleventh}} novel written {{under his own}} name (he has also written crime fiction under the pseudonym Dan Kavanagh) and was released on 4 August 2011 in the United Kingdom. The <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Ending is narrated by a retired man named Tony Webster, who recalls {{how he and his}} clique met Adrian Finn at school and vowed to remain friends for life. When the past catches up with Tony, he reflects on the paths he and his friends have taken. In October 2011, The <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Ending was awarded the Man Booker Prize. The following month it was nominated in the novels category at the Costa Book Awards.|$|E

25|$|From the {{beginning}} of Wetz's Erfurt years, his choral works moved away from Liszt's influence bit by bit and Anton Bruckner began to influence the composer. His striving to imitate Bruckner's tonal language shows {{in the fact that}} no stylistic break arises between these compositions and earlier works. Wetz learned even more from Bruckner, his clear form structures and the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> organic growth of the music without it being overwhelming. Nevertheless, a large measure due to Bruckner, he typically composed powerful and ceremonious effects without stylistic peculiarities.|$|E
25|$|Novalis, who {{was deeply}} read in science, law, philosophy, {{politics}} and political economy, started writing quite early. He left {{an abundance of}} notes on these fields and his early work displays his ease and familiarity with them. His later works are closely connected to his studies and his profession. Novalis collected everything that he had learned, reflected upon it and drew connections in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> encyclopaedic overview on art, religion and science. These notes from the years 1798 and 1799 are called Das allgemeine Brouillon, now available in English under the title Notes for a Romantic Encyclopaedia.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been claimed monarchism and republicanism in Australia {{delineate}} historical and persistent sectarian tensions with, broadly speaking, Catholics {{more likely to be}} republicans and Protestants more likely to be monarchists. This developed out of a historical cleavage in 19th- and 20th-century Australia, in which republicans were predominantly of Irish Catholic background and loyalists were predominantly of British Protestant background. Whilst mass immigration since the Second World War has diluted this conflict, the Catholic–Protestant divide has been cited as a dynamic in the republic debate, particularly in relation to the referendum campaign in 1999. Nonetheless, others have stated that Catholic–Protestant tensions—at least in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Irish–British conflict—are at least forty years dead.|$|E

25|$|By 1987 {{rural society}} was {{more open and}} diverse than in the 1960s and 1970s, and the rigid {{collective}} units of that period, which had reflected the state's overwhelming concern for security, {{had been replaced by}} networks and clusters of smaller units. The new, looser structure demonstrated the priority placed on efficiency and economic growth. Basic security, in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adequate supply of food and guarantees of support for the disabled, orphaned, or aged, was taken for granted. Less than half of China's population remembered the insecurity and risks of pre-1950 society, but the costs and inefficiencies of the collective system were fresh in their minds. Increased specialization and division of labor were trends not likely to be reversed. In the rural areas the significance of the work unit appeared to have diminished, although people still lived in villages, and the actions of low-level administrative cadres still affected ordinary farmers or petty traders in immediate ways.|$|E
25|$|Embryo {{transfer}} {{may be used}} where a {{woman who}} has eggs but no uterus and wants to have a biological baby; she would require the help of a gestational carrier or surrogate to carry the pregnancy. Also, {{a woman who has}} no eggs but a uterus may utilize egg donor IVF, in which case another woman would provide eggs for fertilization and the resulting embryos are placed into the uterus of the patient. Fertilization may be performed using the woman's partner's sperm or by using donor sperm. 'Spare' embryos which are created for another couple undergoing IVF treatment but which are then surplus to that couple's needs may also be transferred (called embryo donation). Embryos may be specifically created by using eggs and sperm from donors and these can then be transferred into the uterus of another woman. A surrogate may carry a baby produced by embryo transfer for another couple, even though neither she nor the 'commissioning' couple is biologically related to the child. Third party reproduction is controversial and regulated in many countries. Persons entering gestational surrogacy arrangements must make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> entirely new type of relationship that does not fit any of the traditional scripts we use to categorize relations as kinship, friendship, romantic partnership or market relations. Surrogates have the experience of carrying a baby that they conceptualize as not of their own kin, while intended mothers have the experience of waiting through nine months of pregnancy and transitioning to motherhood from outside of the pregnant body. This can lead to new conceptualizations of body and self.|$|E

500|$|Italy has {{a strong}} sense of {{national}} identity through distinctive culture - a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> appreciation of beauty and emotionality, which is strongly evidenced in the music. Cultural, political and social issues are often also expressed through music in Italy. Allegiance to music is integrally woven into the social identity of Italians but no single style has been considered a characteristic [...] "national style". Most folk musics are localized, and unique to a small region or city. Italy's classical legacy, however, is an important point of the country's identity, particularly opera; traditional operatic pieces remain a popular part of music and an integral component of national identity. The musical output of Italy remains characterized by [...] "great diversity and creative independence (with) a rich variety of types of expression".|$|E

If the mighty autocrat in the north [...] could know that in Chopin's works, in the simple strains of his mazurkas, there lurks a dangerous enemy, he would place a ban on his music. Chopin's works are cannon buried in flowers!" [...] The biography of Chopin published in 1863 under the name of Franz Liszt (but probably written by Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein) states that Chopin [...] "must be ranked first among the first musicians... individualizing in themselves the poetic <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> entire nation." ...|$|E

Its copper dome reminded me of the furnaces from Wales's industrial heritage and also Ceridwen's cauldron, from which the early poet Taliesin received his inspiration ('awen'). Awen suggests both poetic inspiration and the general creative vision by which people and societies form their aspirations. [...] It was important to me that the English words on the building should not simply be a translation of the Welsh, that they should have their own message. The strata of the slate frontage of the Wales Millennium Centre reminded me of the horizons just beyond Penarth Head. The sea has, traditionally, been for Cardiff the means by which the Welsh export their best to the world and the route by which the world comes to Cardiff. The stones inside the theatre literally sing with opera, musicals and orchestral music, and I wanted to convey the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> international space created by the art of music. —Gwyneth Lewis ...|$|E

Out of thousands of names, 26 turned up on four separate lists; one was Ted Bundy. Detectives also manually compiled a list of their 100 [...] "best" [...] suspects, and Bundy was on that list as well. He was [...] "literally {{at the top of the}} pile" [...] of suspects when word came from Utah of his arrest.|$|E
500|$|During the two {{or three}} years that Mary Shelley spent writing the Spanish and Portuguese Lives from 1834 or 1835 to 1837, she also wrote a novel, Falkner (1837), {{experienced}} the death of her father, William Godwin, started a biography of him, and moved to London after her son, Percy Florence Shelley, entered Trinity College, Cambridge. She had more difficulty with these Lives than with the other volumes' biographies, writing to her friend Maria Gisborne: [...] "I am now about to write a Volume of Spanish & Portugeeze [...] Lives – This is an arduous task, from my own ignorance, & the difficulty of getting books & information". According to Lisa Vargo, a recent editor of the Spanish and Portuguese Lives, Spanish books were hard to come by in England and not much was known regarding Shelley's subjects. However, Shelly ended one plaintive letter to another friend: [...] "The best is that the very thing which occasions the difficulty makes it interesting – namely – the treading in unknown paths & dragging out unknown things – I wish I could go to Spain." [...] While living in Harrow, she refused to go to the British Library in London, writing: [...] "I would not if I could – I do not like finding myself a stray bird among strange men in a character assimililating [...] to their own". At this time, the British Library had special tables for women in the reading room. While some scholars see her refusal to work there as a mark of [...] "feminist protest" [...] others see it as [...] "matter of comfort and practicality", since the reading rooms were [...] "noisy, badly lit, and poorly ventilated". Shelley's continual problems with finding sources mean that her biographies are based on relatively few works. However, Vargo writes that [...] "there is always a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> engaged and intelligent mind at work weighing what should be included, what seems accurate". Shelley tended to focus on obtaining accounts written by people who knew the authors, and when translations of the authors' works were unavailable or poor, she provided her own.|$|E
