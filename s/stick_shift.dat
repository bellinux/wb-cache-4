50|$|A {{weighted}} {{shift knob}} is a performance driven aftermarket modification which entirely replaces the OEM shift knob and sits atop the aftermarket short shifter or OEM manual <b>shift</b> <b>stick.</b> Initially {{designed to be}} used in tandem with a short shifter, it is increasingly being purchased for stock <b>stick</b> <b>shifts.</b> The weight generally varies between 400 and 600 grams or more, depending on the material used. The principle of the weighted shift knob is to make the stick shifter top heavy, thus increasing the throw momentum in order to decrease time between shifts. Weighted gear knobs are offered for sale by a variety of North American-based manufacturers in many shapes and finishes, though they are significantly more expensive than the commonly available aftermarket shift knob.|$|R

The Bonneville was now the top of the line, coming in three body styles of two-door hardtop, four-door vista and four-door wagon. The Star Chief's four-door [...] "Vista" [...] hardtop was also shared by the Bonneville. Catalina models included a two-door hardtop, two-door sedan, four-door sedan, four-door hardtop vista and two wagons, one a six-passenger and one a nine-passenger wagon. Bonneville and Star Chief were built on a [...] wheelbase with the exception of the Bonneville wagon and all Catalina models and Bonneville wagon that rode on a 122-inch wheelbase. Catalina was also seven inches shorter than Bonneville and Star Chief and weighed one hundred to two hundred pounds less than its long-wheelbase counterparts. All 1959 Pontiac engines were equipped with a 389-cubic-inch engine with horsepower ratings from 215Hp economy engine to a conservative rated 345hp Tri power carbureted engine. All automatics were four-speed Super-Hydra-Matics or, as Hydramatic Division who designed and built them called them, [...] "Controlled coupling HydraMatic". A special note here is that Oldsmobile used this same transmission and called it Jetaway HydraMatic and Cadillac also used this transmission and Cadillac called it 315 or P 315 Hydramatic. A three-speed column-mounted <b>stick</b> <b>shift</b> was standard on all Pontiacs. This coincided with major body styling changes across all models that introduced increased glass area, twin V-shaped fins and lower hood profiles.

40|$|Wave {{generation}} and propagation at contact interfaces is a relevant issue in mechanics because they affect directly {{a large number}} of mechanical systems involving either static or sliding frictional parts. Contact dynamics is at the origin of friction induced vibrations, acoustical instabilities, surface damage, wear and fatigue failures [IBRA 94][AKAY 02] Propagating waves at the interface can be exploited for controlling the global friction features of the contact. Beside classical experiments, numerical analysis on dry contacts in sliding state {{has been one of the}} mayor topic in recent literature to which a relevant number of important papers have been dedicated ([RENO 11] and reference therein), due also to the fact that it is a substantial subject of interest for researchers working on many different domains, from dynamics to tribology and geophysics. At the origin of the phenomena cited above there is the wave {{generation and}} propagation at the frictional contact interface. Moreover when the two materials in contact are different, the dynamics of the phenomenon increases in complexity due to the so-called "bimaterial" effect ([WEER 80][ADA 95][BEN 01] and reference therein). This thesis is addressed to the understanding of the mechanisms at the origin of the contact wave fields and its relationship with the local characteristics of the surfaces in contact, as well as with the global dynamics and macroscopic frictional behaviour of the system. The aim of this work is to provide insights on the generation and propagation of the waves through the contact both to avoid instabilities and to control their effect on friction. The work is organized in two main parts. The first part presents the development of a non-linear finite element analysis in large transformations of the dynamic rupture at the interface with contact friction separating two bodies (isotropic and elastic) without relative motion. A rupture is considered when an initially <b>sticking</b> zone <b>shifts</b> in sliding state. The properties of the obtained ruptures are analyzed for a flat interface between dissimilar materials in function of the nucleation energy; then the effect of the interface roughness is analyzed. The differentiated rupture inside the asperities and the conditions for coupling and uncoupling between the waves radiating in the two bodies have been also investigated. In the second part, the analysis deals with the sliding onset between two bodies in contact. The sliding between two bodies made of different isotropic elastic materials and separated by a frictional interface is simulated. The evolution along the time of the global normal and tangential forces is analyzed, relating it to the local phenomena occurring at the interface. This part tries to investigate how micro-slips at the interface, acting as distributed ruptures, trigger the macro-slips between the two bodies. The interaction between local and global dynamics is also studied. Finally a numerical parameter space study is carried out, as a function of several system parameters (contact law, friction coefficient, material damping, normal load, translational velocity and regularization time). The results show the key role of the micro-slips and precursors (detectable wave propagations that occur at tangential global force well below the critical value expected by the friction law) in triggering the macro-slip between the two bodies. Depending on their distribution and magnitude the evolution of the contact forces passes from stick-slip-like behaviour to continuous sliding. The local dynamics at the contact (wave and rupture propagation) is linked to the global behaviour of the system (stick-slip, continuous sliding, induced vibrations); the effect of the contact and system parameters on the transfer of vibrational energy between the sliding contact and the system is investigated. The numerical results obtained by the two parts of the work show a good agreement with experimental results in literature. French-Italian Universit...|$|R

It is a qualitative evaluative study involving seven employees. Inclusion criteria were: being in treatment, being more than 60 years, and reside in the city of Joao Pessoa.

According to the speeches of the elders interviewed, it was possible to identify barriers were identified related to the sick and those related to health services. Among the barriers related to patients were identified: lack of knowledge about TB, the perceived seriousness of the disease and the use of household medications and self-medication, the search for direct health care in secondary and tertiary levels; seeking behavior by late health service, the nonspecific clinical presentation of TB in the elderly, the distance of the services demanded and transportation expenses and examinations, difficulties in collecting sputum for examination and the stigma associated with TB. Already as barriers related to health services, stood out: the opening hours of the family health units, transfer of responsibility, improper assessment of cases with respiratory symptoms in the community, not to carry out home visits or their achievement without control communicating, the delay of the health service-related {{delay in the}} suspicion of the disease and the need to make several visits to the health service to obtain the diagnosis.

Despite of the National Primary Care recommend that the diagnosis of TB should be performed on the first level of health care for the elderly in the study, the diagnosis of TB occurred in other levels of care. Therefore, it is expected that the findings of this study contribute to the strengthening of primary care as gateway to the health system and more than that, contribute to the diagnosis of TB be given early...|$|R
