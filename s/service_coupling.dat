40|$|Nowadays, {{business}} interoperability {{is one of}} the {{key factors}} for assuring competitive advantage for the participant business partners. In order to implement business cooperation, scalable, distributed and portable collaborative systems have to be implemented. This article presents some of the mostly used technologies in this field. Furthermore, it presents a software application architecture based on Business Process Modeling Notation standard and automated semantic web <b>service</b> <b>coupling</b> for modeling business flow in a collaborative manner. The main business processes will be represented in a single, hierarchic flow diagram. Each element of the diagram will represent calls to semantic web services. The business logic (the business rules and constraints) will be structured with the help of OWL (Ontology Web Language). Moreover, OWL will also be used to create the semantic web service specifications. automated <b>service</b> <b>coupling,</b> business ontology, semantic web, BPMN, semantic web...|$|E

WS allows the implementation of SOA recommendations, it supports Web Services Description Language (WSDL) as a description language, communication APIs like Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and Representational State Transfer (REST), and coordination of services through Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) [13]. Though quite exhaustive, none of these technologies offers strong support for non-functional features like non-functional management and quality of service. <b>Service</b> <b>coupling</b> is also too tight to allow true dynamic service evolution: WS offers no particular support for the replacement of a service by another one at {{the middle of the}} execution of the application.|$|E

Vanet communication has recently {{become an increasingly}} popular research topic {{in the area of}} wireless networking. A Vanet turns every participating vehicle into a wireless router or node allowing vehicles to connect and create a network. The primary goal is to increase road safety. Routing in Vanet is an important issue. In this paper various routing protocols are discussed, and out of all Position based routing protocols is found to be suitable for Vanet. GPSR {{is one of the most}} suitable position based routing protocol.

40|$|The service-oriented {{architectural}} style is widely perceived today. However, service orientation {{is a very}} general concept and its application in real-life situations is somewhat ambiguous. This is partially {{due to the fact}} that service-oriented principles are subject to interpretation rather than elements of the style. In this paper we propose a set of design metrics for service-oriented design. Based on an established metric for the coupling of component-based systems we introduce a complexity metric by the means of <b>service</b> <b>coupling.</b> We argue that service aggregators and the centralization of a system’s control flow is appropriate to address a system’s complexity. In order to approach an objective design that incorporates these principles, we introduce four metrics for the analysis of how a system handles its complexity with service-oriented means. Fi-nally, we apply the presented metrics to an enterprise-scale real-life case study that we have conducted...|$|E
40|$|Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) {{define a}} {{framework}} that allows on-line access to distributed geographic data and geoprocessing functionalities, though only very few standardized processing capabilities are yet usable. For the modeler, providing a sophisticated application in form of a web service using interoperable frameworks means {{that he has to}} be in expert not only in his knowledge domain but in web service orchestration and chaining additionally. Simple questions with answers based on integrated sensor results, like “do I have smog at location x ” have to be modeled using GIS techniques before being publishable as a web service. This paper prepares the ground for integrating expert systems that are based on autonomous sensor networks into spatial data infrastructures and frees the expert of the burden of in-depth knowledge of <b>service</b> <b>coupling</b> and managing. Most of the geoprocessing capabilities {{will be part of the}} – the expert system wrapping – service.

This thesis will be a system level test and evaluation of the GHOSTNet infrastructure. The primary objective {{is to determine the}} functional performance of GHOSTNet as a global command and control gateway with the goal of being able to dynamically connect and disconnect diverse forces on a task-force-by-task-force basis. To accomplish this objective, a robust test and evaluation plan will be implemented to base line the system in the moderate operating conditions of COASTS field experiments conducted at Camp Roberts. The system will then be tested in various operation environments to include, but not limited to, Fort Ord, the U. S. Cost Guard Station Monterey Bay, and Southern Thailand as part of the COASTS field experimentation program spanning FY 2008 and FY 2009. US Navy (USN) author...|$|E
40|$|With the {{explosive}} growth {{of the number of}} services published over the Internet, it is difficult to select satisfactory web services among the candidate web services which provide similar functionalities. Quality of Service (QoS) is considered as the most important non-functional criterion for service selection. But this criterion is no longer considered as the only criterion to rank web services, satisfying user's preferences. The similarity measure (outputs-inputs similarity) between concepts based on ontology in an interconnected network of semantic Web services involved in a composition {{can be used as a}} distinguishing criterion to estimate the semantic quality of selected services for the composite <b>service.</b> <b>Coupling</b> the semantic similarity as the functional aspect and quality of services allows us to further constrain and select services for the valid composite services. In this paper, we present an overall service selection and ranking framework which firstly classify candidate web services to different QoS levels respect to user's QoS requirements and preferences with an Associative Classification algorithm and then rank the most qualified candidate services based on their functional quality through semantic matching. The experimental results show that proposed framework can satisfy service requesters' non-functional requirements.
