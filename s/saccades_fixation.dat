During face recognition, initial fixations {{to the center of}} the nose have been taken to indicate this location is optimal for information extraction. However, the use of fixations as a marker for information use rests on the assumption that fixation {{patterns are}} predominantly determined by stimulus and task, despite the fact that fixations are also influenced by visuo-motor factors. Here, we tested the effect of starting position on fixation patterns during a face recognition task with upright and inverted faces. While we observed differences in fixations between upright and inverted faces, likely reflecting differences in cognitive processing, there was also a strong effect of start position. Over the first five <b>saccades,</b> <b>fixation</b> patterns across start positions were only coarsely similar, with most fixations around the eyes.

Additionally, a high gain in the torsion test is suspicious of cerebellar dysfunction. In this study, 141 patients out of 973 had {{at least one of these}} anomalies. For 125 patients we were able to compare the initial findings in the vestibular examination with the final diagnosis by otologists, neurologists and general practitioners. The complaints of 37. 6 % of the patients with these electronystagmographic (ENG) anomalies appeared to be of central origin. Abnormal saccades, an abnormal smooth pursuit, and an elevated gain in the torsion test were not independently diagnostic for central vestibular disease.

For this reason exploration of information seeking behavior is an exciting area of research. Current study provides insight on information seeking behavior using a classic ‘Find the Difference’ game. 50 university students between the age of 19 and 26 participated in the study. Eye movement data were recorded with a Tobii T 120 device. Participants carried out 4 continuous tasks. Each task included two pictures {{side by side with}} 7 hidden differences. After finishing the tasks, participants were asked to repeat the game with the same picture set. This data collection methodology allows the evaluation of learning curves. Additionally, participants were asked about their hand preference. For the purpose of analysis the following metrics were applied: task times (including <b>saccades),</b> <b>fixation</b> count and fixation duration (without saccades). The right- and left-hand side on each picture was selected as AOI (Area of Interest) to detect side preference in connection with hand preference. Results suggest a significant difference between male and female participants regarding aggregated task times (male 58. 37 s respectively female 68. 37 s), deviation in the number of fixations and fixation duration (apparently female have less but longer fixations) and also in the distribution of fixations between AOIs.

40|$|Neural {{recording}} and electrical stimulation {{results suggest that}} the dorsomedial frontal cortex (DMFC) of macaque is involved in oculomotor behavior. We reversibly inactivated the DMFC using lidocaine and examined how saccadic eye movements and fixations were affected. The inactivation methods and monkeys were the same as those used in a previous study of the frontal eye field (FEF), another frontal oculomotor region. In the first stage of the present study, monkeys performed tasks that required the generation of single <b>saccades</b> and <b>fixations.</b> During 15 DMFC inactivations, we found only mild, infrequent deficits. This contrasts with our prior finding that FEF inactivation causes severe, reliable deficits in performance of these tasks. In the second stage of the study, we investigated whether DMFC inactivation affected behavior when a monkey was required to make more than one <b>saccade</b> and <b>fixation.</b> We used a double-step task: two targets were flashed in rapid succession and the monkey had to make two saccades to foveate the target locations. In each of five experiments, DMFC inactivation caused a moderate, significant deficit. Both ipsi- and contraversive saccades were disrupted. In two experiments, the first saccades were made to the wrong place and had increased latencies. In one experiment, first saccades were unaffected, but second saccades were made to the wrong place and had increased latencies. In the remaining two experiments, specific reasons for the deficit were not detected. Saline infusions into DMFC had no effect. Inactivation of FEF caused a larger double-step deficit than did inactivation of DMFC. The FEF inactivation impaired contraversive first or second saccades of the sequence. In conclusion, our {{results suggest that the}} DMFC makes an important contribution to generating sequential <b>saccades</b> and <b>fixations</b> but not single <b>saccades</b> and <b>fixations.</b> Compared with the FEF, the DMFC has a weaker, less directional, more task-dependent oculomotor influence...|$|R
40|$|In schizophrenia, {{patients}} display dysfunctions {{during the}} execution of simple visual tasks such as anti-saccade or smooth pursuit. In more ecological scenarios, such as free viewing of natural images, patients appear to make fewer and longer visual fixations and display shorter scanpaths. It {{is not clear whether}} these measurements reflect alterations in their proficiency to perform basic eye movements, such as <b>saccades</b> and <b>fixations,</b> or are related to high-level mechanisms, such as exploration or attention. We utilized free exploration of natural images of different complexities as a model of an ecological context where normally operative mechanisms of visual control can be accurately measured. We quantified visual exploration as Euclidean distance, scanpaths, <b>saccades</b> and visual <b>fixation,</b> using the standard SR-Research eye tracker algorithm (SR). We then compared this result with a computation that includes microsaccades (EM). We evaluated 8 schizophrenia patients and corresponding healthy controls (HC). Next, we tested whether the decrement in the number of <b>saccades</b> and <b>fixations,</b> as well as their increment in duration reported previously in schizophrenia patients, resulted from the increasing occurrence of undetected microsaccades. We found that when utilizing the standard SR algorithm, patients displayed shorter scanpaths as well as fewer and shorter <b>saccades</b> and <b>fixations.</b> When we employed the EM algorithm, the differences in these parameters between patients and HC were no longer significant. On the other hand, we found that image complexity {{plays an important role in}} exploratory behaviors, demonstrating that this factor explains most of differences between eye-movement behaviors in schizophrenia patients. These results help elucidate the mechanisms of visual motor control that are affected in schizophrenia and contribute to the finding of adequate markers for diagnosis and treatment for this condition...|$|R

40|$|Eye {{movement}} {{analysis is}} a fundamental component of eye tracking research, especially in real-time envi-ronments. Prediction of eye movements is particularly desirable for the amelioration of sensor lag. Previous analysis approaches concentrated on binary classification of eye movements into saccades and non-saccades. Although effective and fairly simple, this approach confuses the classification of smooth pursuit and fixations by lumping them into the non-saccadic category. This thesis derives a model of simulated eye movements suitable for analysis with the Kalman filter. The resulting simulation classifies real-time mouse movement into the three distinct categories of <b>saccades,</b> <b>fixations,</b> and smooth pursuits. The Kalman filter’s inherent prediction/correction framework allows for first order movement prediction that can be exploited to reduce sensor lag. The simulation allows inspection of the Kalman filter’s predictive accuracy through comparison of the predicted and observed signal. Acknowledgement...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A biologically {{inspired}} foveated attention {{system in}} an object detection scenario is proposed. Thereby, a highperformance active multi-focal camera system imitates visual {{behaviors such as}} scan, <b>saccade</b> and <b>fixation.</b> Bottom-up attention uses wide-angle stereo data to select a sequence of fixation points in the peripheral field of view. Successive <b>saccade</b> and <b>fixation</b> of high foveal resolution using a telephoto camera enables high accurate object recognition. Once an object is recognized as target object, the bottom-up attention model is adapted to the current environment, using the top-down information extracted from this target object. The bottom-up attention model and the object recognition algorithm based on SIFT are implemented using CUDA technology on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which highly accelerates image processing. In the experimental evaluation, all the target objects were detected in different backgrounds. Evident improvements in accuracy, flexibility and efficiency are achieved. I...|$|R

In this paper we report our first step towards an effective discrimination of these movements. In a user study we collect naturalistic eye movements from 19 people using the two most common measurement techniques (EOG and IR-based).

30|$|It {{follows from}} this that similar {{features}} of written text, {{such as high}} frequency conjunctive adjuncts which are typically small words, provide points where the saccading eye knows not to focus; when reading, during a saccade our eyes may recognise conjunctions, as they do punctuation marks, as points to ignore {{in order to see}} what precedes them. These easily-recognised marks may have relatively little ideational meaning of their own, but point the reader to the preceding units which carry the textual value of an informational culmination in prominence (Matthiessen, 1995 b; Fries, 2000). Empirical research is required to support this hypothesis. To my knowledge, reading studies such as those described above designed to measure the effects of these words on <b>saccades,</b> <b>fixations</b> and reading speed have yet to be carried out.

For all of these reasons, eye-movement recording has become an invaluable tool in the study of how readers process text.

Eye movements of 10 patients and 10 controls were monitored during fixation. Visual fields were assessed by static perimetry {{to determine the extent}} of the field defects. Eye movements were separated into saccades and drifts, with fixation stability assessed by bivariate contour ellipse area (BCEA). To quantify the number and location of preferred retinal loci (PRL), the kernel density estimator and expectation maximization for mixtures of gaussians were used. Results.

Eight children were studied and their results were compared to those of eight normal adults doing the same task. For each group word reading data were also compared with data in a task requiring <b>saccades</b> and <b>fixations</b> to target-LEDs. Horizontal saccades from both eyes were recorded with a photoelectric device (Oculometer, Bouis). Latencies of saccades both to words and to LEDs presented at predictable location were similar, and they were also similar between children and adults. In contrast, disconjugacy of saccades was significantly increased for children and similar in the two tasks (LEDs or words). Disconjugate post-saccadic drift and its velocity were also significantly higher in children and similar in the two tasks. Substantial conjugate leftward drift was present for children only, and for the word task only. Finally, fixation duration on words was significantly longer in children than in adults. We conclude that binocular coordination and fixation stability is poor in children and that it could be partially responsible for the long fixation duration. Binocular coordination does not depend on the task (LEDs or words) neither for adults, nor for children; this contrasts prior reports...|$|R

Each run consisted of alternating blocks in which the subject was guided to make a series of <b>saccades</b> and <b>fixations</b> that constituted either a Typical or an Atypical face scanpath. Typical scanpaths were defined as a scanpath in which the fixation cross landed on the eyes or the mouth in 90 % of all trials. Atypical scanpaths were defined as scanpaths in which the fixation cross landed on the eyes or mouth on 12 % of all trials. The average saccade length was identical in both typical and atypical blocks, and both were preceded by a baseline block where the fixation cross made much smaller jumps {{in the middle of}} the screen. Within the functionally predefined face area of the ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOTC), typical scanpaths evoked significantly more activity when compared to atypical scanpaths.
