40|$|Recent advancements in {{wireless}} communication technology and portable computing are opening up exciting {{possibilities for the}} future of mobile network applications. One obvious domain for such mobile network applications is in vehicle traffic scenarios, where vehicle-mounted mobile hosts, with {{wireless communication}} ability, form an ad hoc network. With the aim of improving transportation systems, through the reduction of road accidents, inter-vehicle coordination applications are being built upon these vehicle-based ad hoc networks. This dissertation is concerned with investigating the use of group communication to support inter-vehicle coordination applications in ad hoc networks. Specifically, one particular case study of inter-vehicle coordination is examined: the 4 <b>Way</b> <b>Stop.</b> A 4 <b>Way</b> <b>Stop</b> is a common road junction, with four approaching roads, of equal importance, meeting at a single point. The problem of a 4 <b>Way</b> <b>Stop</b> is in determining which vehicle should be allowed to cross the junction at any one time. This dissertation identifies the requirements on group communication to successfully support a 4 <b>Way</b> <b>Stop</b> application. Requirements for optional group communication application implementations: primary component implementation and partitionable membership implementation are both listed. Moving from the specific to the general, the examination of a 4 <b>Way</b> <b>Stop</b> application provides valuable insights into the general domain of inter-vehicle coordination...|$|R
