The flood and dam-endangered areas are protected by a levee, but lenders require expensive flood insurance in the delta. There have been serious discussions to eliminate the need for flood insurance and this requirement has already been waived in some areas and may one day no longer be considered a credible threat.|$|E

Fire engines extinguished a blaze in a {{liquefied natural gas}} tank at Daiichi Sankyo's Onahama Plant.

A landslide crushed two vehicles and buried three homes in the city, trapping a number of the inhabitants. The incident resulted in two immediate deaths. Four people were critically injured and taken to hospital; one of them was later pronounced dead.

Some mainframe-specific setups, such as GDPS, require FICON (or its predecessor ESCON). Mainframe-attached storage, such as IBM's System Storage DS8000, often supports both protocols. The storage is divided into fixed block <b>storage</b> <b>volumes</b> and mainframe-specific CKD/ECKD <b>storage</b> <b>volumes.</b> To access the fixed block volumes, one uses FCP.

40|$|Future {{changes to}} the UK’s energy system, {{specifically}} radically increasing the deployment of renewable energy sources at all scales, will require much more flexibility in demand to ensure system stability. Using dynamic building simulation, this paper explores the feasibility of using thermal storage to enable flexibility in heat demand over a range of timescales: diurnal, weekly and seasonal. Time-varying space heating and hot water demand profiles for four common UK housing types were generated, accounting for different occupancy characteristics and various UK climates. These simulated heat demand profiles were {{used to calculate the}} necessary <b>storage</b> <b>volumes</b> for four heat storage options: hot water, concrete, high-temperature magnetite blocks and an inorganic phase change material. The results indicated that without first radically improving insulation levels to reduce heat demands, even facilitating diurnal heat storage would require low-temperature, sensible heat <b>storage</b> <b>volumes</b> well in excess of 1000 L, in many cases. Storage of heat over {{more than a few days}} becomes infeasible due to the large <b>storage</b> <b>volumes</b> required, except in the case of dwellings with small heat demands and using high-temperature storage.
