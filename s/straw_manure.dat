40|$|The {{interplanting}} with zero-tillage of rice, i. e. direct sowing rice 10 – 20 {{days before}} wheat harvesting, and remaining about 30 -cm high stubble after cutting wheat or rice with no tillage, {{is a new}} cultivation technology in wheat-rice rotation system. To {{study the effects of}} interplanting with zero tillage and <b>straw</b> <b>manure</b> on rice growth and quality, an experiment was conducted in a wheat-rotation rotation system. Four treatments, i. e. ZIS (Zero-tillage, <b>straw</b> <b>manure</b> and rice interplanting), ZI (Zero-tillage, no <b>straw</b> <b>manure</b> and rice interplanting), PTS (Plowing tillage, <b>straw</b> <b>manure</b> and rice transplanting), and PT (Plowing tillage, no <b>straw</b> <b>manure</b> and rice transplanting), were used. ZIS reduced plant height, leaf area per plant and the biomass of rice plants, but the biomass accumulation of rice at the late stage was quicker than that under conventional transplanting cultivation. In the first year (2002), {{there was no significant difference}} in rice yield among the four treatments. However, rice yield decreased in interplanting with zero-tillage in the second year (2003). Compared with the transplanting treatments, the number of filled grains per panicle decreased but 1000 -grain weight increased in interplanting with zero-tillage, which were the main factors resulting in higher yield. Interplanting with zero-tillage improved the milling and appearance qualities of rice. The rates of milled and head rice increased while chalky rice rate and chalkiness decreased in interplanting with zero-tillage. Zero-tillage and interplanting also affected rice nutritional and cooking qualities. In 2002, ZIS showed raised protein content, decreased amylose content, softer gel consistency, resulting in improved rice quality. In 2003, zero-tillage and interplanting decreased protein content and showed similar amylose content as compared with transplanting treatments. Moreover, protein content in PTS was obviously increased in comparison with the other three treatments. The rice in interplanting with zero-tillage treatments had higher peak viscosity and breakdown, lower setback, showing better rice taste quality. The <b>straw</b> <b>manure</b> had no significant effect on rice viscosity under interplanting with zero-tillage, but had the negative influence on the rice taste quality under transplanting with plowing tillage...|$|E

40|$|Here, {{we report}} on a two-years field {{experiment}} aimed at the quantification of the emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4) from the dominant wheat maize double cropping system in North China Plain. The experiment had 6 different fertilization strategies, including a control treatment, recommended fertilization, with and without <b>straw</b> and <b>manure</b> applications, and nitrification inhibitor and slow release urea. Application of N fertilizer slightly decreased CH 4 uptake by soil. Direct N 2 O emissions derived from recommended urea application was 0. 39 % of the annual urea-N input. Both <b>straw</b> and <b>manure</b> had relatively low N 2 O emissions factors. Slow release urea had a relatively high emission factor.

However, the relationship between the type of organic matter used and the resulting properties of the aggregate structure is unclear. Using high resolution micro x ray computed tomography we investigated the internal structures of aggregates from fields to which a variety of organic material had been applied. The sampling sites are five paddy fields with rice wheat rotations four treated with different organic matters and one untreated control in southwest Japan. The organic materials used were rice straw, rice <b>straw</b> <b>manure,</b> wheat straw, and livestock manure. The soils were classified as Endogleyic Hydragric Anthrosol Clayic. Imaging samples were hand picked from bulk soil samples collected in October 2008.

Organic substances, such as manure, root and seed, in the aggregates were observed. By thresholding the gray scale of the images, it was possible to distinguish between porous and solid phases. These imaging studies indicated that applying manure to soils effectively increased the porosity of their intra aggregates.

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the practice of}} applying nutrients in organic or slowly soluble inorganic form {{in the belief that}} plants will obtain balanced nutrition through the actions of soil microbes. The organic principle of only fertilising the soil and not directly feeding the crop with watersoluble nutrients has no support in science. The release of organically bound nutrients in soil through biological activity is not necessarily synchronised with crop demands and occurs even at times when there is no crop growth. Changes in the soil biological community do not overcome this limitation. Despite the ideal of organic agriculture being self-sustaining through cycling of nutrients, in principle only on-farm wastes are recycled and most municipal wastes are excluded due to concerns about pollutants and philosophical views on life (biodynamic agriculture). Nutrient supply in European organic agriculture is mainly covered through purchase of <b>straw,</b> <b>manure</b> and fodder from conventional agriculture and by-products from the food industry. Untreated minerals seem to play a minor role. The fertility of agricultural soils can only be maintained over the long-term if plant nutrients removed, are replaced with equivalent amounts and if added sources have a higher solubility than those present in the soil. These conditions are in most cases not fulfilled in organic agriculture. It can thus be concluded that the naturalness of nutrient sources is no guarantee of superior quality and that promotion of organic principles does not improve the supply and recycling of nutrients but excludes other more effective solutions for nutrient use in agricultural systems...|$|E
40|$|Up to {{the present}} day, wood {{has been used to}} supply the needs for cooking in rural Africa. Due to the ongoing deforestation, {{households}} need to change to other energy sources. To cover this need, a large amount of people are using residues from agriculture (<b>straw,</b> <b>manure)</b> instead. However, both straw and manure also have a function in agriculture for soil improvement. Using all the straw and manure will seriously affect the food production. In this paper we first determine the amount of energy that households need for cooking (about 7 GJ per year). Then we estimate the amount of residues that can be obtained from the agricultural system and the amount of energy for cooking that can be derived from this amount when different conversion techniques are used. The amount of residues needed is strongly affected by the technology used. The traditional three stone fires require at least two times as much resource than the more advanced technologies. Up to 4 ha of land or 15 cows are needed to provide enough straw and manure to cook on the traditional three stone fires. When more efficient techniques are used (briquetting, biogas) this can be reduced to 2 ha and six cows. Due to large variation in resource availability between households, about 80 % of the households own less than 2 ha and 70 % holds less than four cows. This means that even when modern, energy efficient techniques are used the largest share of the population is not able to generate enough energy for cooking from their own land and/or cattle. Most rural households in Sub-Saharan Africa may share similar resource holding characteristics for which the results from the current findings on Ethiopia can be relevant...|$|E

However, {{the differences between the}} straw- and slurry-associated prokaryotic communities, their dynamic changes throughout the co-fermentation process, and their correlations with bioreactor performance are not fully understood. To address these questions, we investigated the prokaryotic community compositions and the dynamics of prokaryotes attached to the straw and in the slurry during co-fermentation of wheat <b>straw</b> and swine <b>manure</b> using pyrosequencing technique. The results showed that straw- and slurry-associated prokaryotes were different in their structure and function.

The objective of this research was to compare the ability of fresh and composted manure to induce suppression of Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn;Soil in microplots was amended with urea, dairy manure, and composted dairy manure, infested with sclerotia of R. solani, and planted with beans. Infestation and planting were repeated two more times. Seedling emergence was greatest in soil amended with manure, and least with urea. Freedom from visible lesions and yield of plant tops were also greatest for plants grown with manure. Soil media in the greenhouse were amended with urea, urea and <b>straw,</b> <b>manure,</b> and compost. All four amendment rates were chosen to provide 75 ppm nitrogen; the latter three amendments added 0. 3 % organic matter to the soil media. After a 1 -week incubation, soil mixtures were infested with 0, 10, 20, or 30 Colony Forming Units (CFU) /g R. solani sclerotia and then planted with radish four times. Radish Health Index (RHI) was used to compare treatment effects on disease. A large value for RHI indicated high levels of seedling emergence and a small size for any lesions. RHI was greatest for seedlings planted with urea and straw, less with manure or compost, and least with urea alone. RHI with urea and straw was greater at all infestation levels than with other amendments, but at 20 and 30 CFU/g infestation, RHI did not differ among the other three amendments. Despite the differences in RHI, the recovery of R. solani in heat-killed beet seed baits did not differ among treatments;In conclusion, all soils became suppressive, but amendments affect the rate at which suppressiveness develops and disease suppression does not imply pathogen suppression. Manure is more effective than compost in suppressing disease at low inoculum levels, but neither amendment is effective at high inoculum levels. Because manure can reduce plant disease better than urea, the value of amending soil with manure exceeds the fertilizer benefit...|$|E
40|$|In the {{preliminary}} studies {{carried out in}} the laboratory and greenhouse, very similar effects were exerted on the bacterial activities in the soil and on the yield of oats from the use of the variously prepared artificial manures and from the application of farm manure. Well-rotted farm manure had a much greater effect on carbon dioxide production in sand cultures than did the artificial manures, but some of the artificial manures produced as large an influence as did the fresh farm manure. The sweet clover manure had a distinct beneficial effect, and the <b>straw</b> <b>manure</b> also increased the carbon dioxide production. The greater influence of the well-rotted farm manure was undoubtedly due to the greater decomposition occurring in that material than in the artificial manures. The nitrification studies in sand cultures in the greenhouse indicated that nitrate accumulation was depressed by the additions of farm manure and artificial manures, there being just as great a depression from the farm manure in 71 / 2 and 15 ton applications as from the artificial manures. The nitrifying power of the sand cultures was increased by the treatments, the artificial manures, in some cases, having a greater effect than the farm manure. The straw-clover manure and the sweet clover manure showed a greater effect than the farm manure. Apparently the greater nitrification brought about by the treatments was followed by a greater assimilation and, hence, there was a lower content of nitrates at 11 dates of sampling. In this test the artificial manures and the farm manure seemed to have similar effects on nitrification, but the artificial manures, in some cases, had a greater stimulative influence on the oats grown than did the farm manure. In the nitrate assimilation experiment in the laboratory, the application of farm manure appreciably stimulated the development of the nitrate assimilating organisms in the Carrington loam. The oats straw and the <b>straw</b> <b>manure</b> brought about a greater stimulation, but the artificial manures in general showed a smaller stimulation on this group of organisms. It is apparent that the artificial manures had no greater influence in increasing nitrate assimilation than did farm manure. These results were confirmed by later tests in the greenhouse and in the field on the Carrington loam, but it was noted that those artificial manures, which were not so well decomposed when applied to the soil, stimulated these nitrate assimilating organisms more and the effects persisted in the soil for a longer period. In the greenhouse experiments on Carrington loam, the artificial manures and farm manure had very similar effects on nitrate production, and while the influence on nitrification was not quite so great at first, the later effects were greater than those produced by farm manure. The influence of the various manures was similar on the crop of oats grown in this test. Field experiments on the Webster loam in 1926 and 1927 and on the Carrington loam in 1928 and 1929 with variously prepared artificial manures in comparison with farm manure indicate that nitrate assimilation, nitrification, nitrate accumulation and the numbers of bacteria, molds and actinomycetes were very similarly affected by the additions of the various manures. The yields of corn were also influenced in a very similar way by the artificial manures and farm manure, altho in some instances there were differences in yields which were out of line with the general trend of the results. From the results as a whole it is apparent that the proper composting of straw and cellulose residues may permit the production of artificial manures which will give similar effects on bacteriological conditions in the soil and on crop yields to those occasioned by farm manure. There is a similar stimulation in the nitrification process and in the numbers of organisms, and while nitrate assimilation is also stimulated by the artificial manures, the influence on this process is no greater than that produced by farm manure. While, therefore, there may be a reduced content of nitrates in the soils following the addition of these artificial manures, there is no greater reduction than that brought about by farm manure. As farm manure has a well-known beneficial effect on crop growth, it is apparent that there need be no deleterious effect from well-decomposed artificial manures either on crop yields or on soil conditions in general. In fact it would seem that quite as large beneficial effects should be exerted, and any increase in nitrate assimilation and decrease in nitrate content is more than offset, from a crop production standpoint, by the increased nitrification which is occasioned...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{work with}} {{solution}} cultures inoculated with soil showed that 20. 83 mgm. of nitrate nitrogen disappeared in eight days, while the total nitrogen increased. The results obtained with soil cultures {{were very similar}} to those obtained with the solution cultures. Treating the soil with straw in the greenhouse brought about a complete utilization of the nitrates, while there was a small accumulation of nitrate in the soil treated with farm manure. The nitrate-assimilating power of the soil was influenced by a number of factors, and, altho much information was secured by the methods employed, more work on the various factors affecting nitrate assimilation in soils is desirable. It was found that dextrose increased the nitrate-assimilating power of the soil. This material furnished a source of energy for those organisms which utilized both nitrate and ammonia, thus preventing an accumulation of nitrate. Since the nitrate content of the soil at any given time is the resultant of many different forces, some treatment which would eliminate all but nitrate assimilation would facilitate the accurate measurement of this process. The addition of a readily available energy source, especially one poor in nitrogen, tends to bring about this condition. Straw, partially decomposed straw and farm manure brought about an assimilation of nitrate immediately upon being added to the soil. The straw brought about a larger assimilation of nitrate than the <b>straw</b> <b>manure</b> or the farm manure. Manure, lime and rock phosphate applied {{over a period of years}} on Marshall silt loam and Grundy silt loam tended, in general, to lower: the nitrate-assimilating power of the soil. The nitrate-assimilating power of Carrington loam treated in the field with different manures varied thruout the season, showing only slight differences between the different treatments. Very similar results were secured with manure, lime and crop residues on both continuous corn and corn in the three-year rotation. Five cultures of nitrate-assimilating and nine cultures of denitrifying bacteria were isolated and studied in pure culture. No names have been suggested for these organisms and their systematic relationships have not been determined. A number of nitrate-assimilating and denitrifying tests were carried out with some of the organisms in pure culture. Nitrate assimilation is common to a large number of soil microorganisms. It has been suggested, however, that the molds are largely responsible for nitrate assimilation when the energy supply of the soil is increased. The results obtained in these experiments indicate that certain molds may be less efficient nitrate assimilators than some bacteria...|$|E
50|$|The canal {{was used}} for the {{carriage}} of coal, timber, <b>straw</b> and <b>manure.</b> <b>Straw</b> was shipped to London, for use as bedding for horses, and horse manure was transported in the opposite direction, from the bus depots of London, to be used as fertiliser on farms in the locality. Coal was delivered to Aston Clinton House from the canal, and to three gas works, which were located at Wendover, Halton and near Bucklandwharf bridge, which carries the old route of the A41 road over the canal. The coal came from the Midlands, and was used to produce coal for lighting. The Gas Works at Aston Clinton survived until 1964. In 1875, Heygates flour mill was built {{on the banks of the}} canal at Gamnel Bridge. It was powered by steam engines, for which the canal supplied the water. Grain was delivered by boat, and the processed flour was transported away by boat. After the end of the Second World War water transport was superseded by trucks, and in 2013 the mill operated a fleet of 16 trucks to deliver flour to markets in the south of England.|$|R
