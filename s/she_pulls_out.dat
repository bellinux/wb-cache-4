60|$|I {{go over to}} the fence, at {{the edge}} of the right of way, and watch. Ah, ha! What's that? I see a lantern on top of the train, moving along from front to rear. They think I haven't come down, and they are searching the roofs for me. And better than that--on the ground on each side of the train, moving abreast with the lantern on top, are two other lanterns.
