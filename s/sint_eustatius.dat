5|$|Hostilities {{between the}} English and Dutch in 1664 {{led to a}} change in {{government}} policy: colonial governors were now authorised to issue letters of marque against the Dutch. Many of the privateers, including Morgan, did not take up the letters, although an expedition to conquer the Dutch island of <b>Sint</b> <b>Eustatius</b> led to the death of Morgan's father-in-law, who was leading a 600-man force.|$|E
5|$|Pennatomys nivalis is an extinct oryzomyine rodent {{from the}} islands of <b>Sint</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> Saint Kitts, and Nevis in the Lesser Antilles. The only species in the genus Pennatomys, it is known from {{skeletal}} remains found in Amerindian archeological sites on all three islands, with dates ranging from 790–520 BCE to 900–1200 CE. No live specimens are known, but there are several historical records of rodents from Saint Kitts and Nevis that could conceivably refer to Pennatomys. The animal apparently belongs to a group within the tribe Oryzomyini that includes many other island-dwelling species.|$|E
5|$|Summer Carnivals {{include those}} on Antigua, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, <b>Sint</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> Saint John, Saint Lucia, Grenada, Saba, Nevis and Anguilla, {{the latter two}} of which are {{especially}} known for popular calypso competitions. Christmastime Carnivals are held on Montserrat, Saint Croix, Saint Martin and Saint Kitts; Montserrat's distinctive Carnival includes masquerades and steelbands, and both islands also feature calypso competitions. The Carnival of Sint Maarten, which takes place a month after Easter, is known for the burning of King Moui-Moui as the culmination of the festival. Many islands, especially the French and Dutch Antilles, are home to pre-Lenten Carnivals, including Martinique, Aruba, Saint-Barthélemy, Bonaire, Curaçao, Dominica, Saint Thomas and Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|The smaller {{islands of}} Saint Martin, Saba and <b>Sint</b> <b>Eustatius</b> largely {{share in the}} same folk instruments, dances and songs as their neighbors; however, these islands remain largely unstudied. Saba {{is home to a}} vital percussive music tradition, most closely {{associated}} with private parties, using instrumentation similar to Curaçao, Bonaire and Aruba. Saint Martin is home to a national dance form called the ponum, which dates to the 19th century and was only displaced by string bands in the mid-20th century. Saint Martin is also home to a calypso-like quimbe song form, that remains {{a major part of the}} island's culture.|$|E
5|$|When the National Hurricane Center {{issued its}} first {{advisory}} on Tropical Depression Three, {{the governments of}} Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and the British Virgin Islands issued a Tropical Storm Warning for their respective territories. When the depression strengthened to Tropical Storm Chris, Tropical Storm Warnings were also issued for Saba, <b>Sint</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> Saint-Barthélemy, and Saint Martin. Three Royal Caribbean cruise ships re-routed their paths to avoid the storm. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) representatives coordinated with local emergency management officials in the United States Virgin Islands to determine if preparation necessities would be adequate, such as hospital usage, shelters, and sand bags.|$|E
5|$|Brandenburg-Prussia {{tried to}} acquire Crab Island in 1687, but {{the island was}} claimed also by Denmark, England and Spain, and when a second {{expedition}} in 1692 found the island in Danish hands, the plan was abandoned. 1689, Brandenburg-Prussia annexed Peter Island, but the small rock proved ineligible for trade or settlement. In 1691, Brandenburg-Prussia and the Duchy of Courland agreed on a partition of Tobago, but since Courland was no longer present on the island which was meanwhile claimed by England, the agreement was nullified, and negotiations with England {{did not result in}} an agreement. In 1695, Brandenburg-Prussia tried {{to get a hold of}} Tortola, but England denied them settlement. Likewise, England declined an offer to purchase <b>Sint</b> <b>Eustatius</b> in 1697.|$|E
5|$|Remains of Pennatomys nivalis {{come from}} several Amerindian archeological sites {{on each of}} the three islands where it has been found; it was eaten by the native Amerindian population. The oldest site is Hichmans' Shell Heap on Nevis, which is from the Archaic age and is dated to 790 to 520BCE. The youngest, Sulphur Ghaut (900–1200 CE), is also on Nevis, and is from the post-Saladoid period. Other sites on Nevis include Hichmans (Saladoid, 100 BCE – 600 CE), Indian Castle (post-Saladoid, 650–880 CE), and Coconut Walk (post-Saladoid, no {{absolute}} dates known). The only site on <b>Sint</b> <b>Eustatius</b> is the Saladoid and post-Saladoid site Golden Rock (80 BCE – 980 CE). Each of the three sites yielding Pennatomys on Saint Kitts is from the post-Saladoid period: Sugar Factory (700–1000 CE), Bloody Point (660–1115 CE), and Cayon (undated).|$|E
5|$|The {{islands of}} Curaçao, Bonaire, Aruba, <b>Sint</b> <b>Eustatius</b> and Saint Martin share musical styles, {{as well as}} {{maintain}} their own sets of folk and popular dances, ranging from the impromptu Statian road block to calypso, zouk and soca. African, indigenous and European ancestry predominate, though more recent immigrants have brought musical styles from Lebanon, China and India. In popular music, the islands are known for the Combined Rhythm, like local favorites the Happy Peanuts and Expresando Rimto i Ambiente. Kaseko music from the mainland country Suriname is also popular. Traditional music of Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles, however, is primarily African, characterized {{by the use of}} complex, highly developed polyrhythms, dance styles and drums like the tambú. Other African-derived instruments include metal percussion rods, agan, the rasp wiri, aerophones like the cachu trumpet, becu transverse double-reed wind instrument, and the bow benta.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Frances for the Leeward Islands {{during the afternoon}} of August 29, which was upgraded to a warning that night and expanded to include the islands of Anguilla, Antigua, Barbuda, Nevis, Saba, Saint Kitts, <b>Sint</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> and Sint Maarten. A hurricane watch was issued during the night of August 29 for the northern British Virgin Islands, the northern United States Virgin Islands, Culebra, and Vieques. On the morning of August 30, the hurricane watch for Vieques was downgraded to a {{tropical storm}} watch. That afternoon, hurricane watches were changed to tropical storm warnings across Puerto Rico, Culebra, Vieques, British Virgin Islands, and the northern U. S. Virgin Islands while a tropical storm watch was issued for St. Croix while all remaining hurricane watches were dropped. That night, tropical storm watches were issued for eastern portions of the northern coast of the Dominican Republic while a tropical storm warning was issued for Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|At noon on 9 February, while {{cruising}} independently, Truxtun's men sighted a frigate off {{the coast}} of Nevis. Upon approach it was evident that the vessel was flying American colors, and Constellation attempted to move closer to investigate. The frigate was the French L'Insurgente under Michel-Pierre Barreaut. Approaching L'Insurgente, Truxtun signaled her to discern her nationality, first displaying British signals followed by the American signals. L'Insurgente replaced the American colors with the French and fired a gun, the purpose of which was unclear. Truxtun claimed L'Insurgente's shot was fired to windward to signal a fight, while Barreaut claimed he ordered the shot fired to leeward to signal that he wished to communicate. Regardless, Barreaut mistook the Constellation for a British warship and fled toward the Dutch islands of Saba and <b>Sint</b> <b>Eustatius</b> to escape, while Truxtun gave chase. By 1:30p.m. both ships had sailed into a gale. In the storm L'Insurgente was damaged and lost her main topmast. Constellation came through unscathed and continued to close on Barreaut.|$|E
5|$|Issues {{regarding}} {{debt and}} revenue-sharing within the Netherlands Antilles {{eventually led to}} the dissolution of the territory and its division as constituent islands Curaçao and Sint Maarten claimed a status of autonomy similar to that of Aruba, while the islands Bonaire, Saba, and <b>Sint</b> <b>Eustatius</b> were absorbed directly into the Netherlands. Thus, the 2008 Summer Olympics served as the final Olympics games in which the Netherlands Antilles participated as a territory. The future of the Dutch Antillean athletes to participate in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London were cast into doubt as a result. As residents of the Netherlands Antilles hold Dutch passports, IAAF General Secretary Pierre Weiss remarked all former Dutch Antillean athletes should immediately become eligible to represent the Netherlands in the Netherlands Antilles' stead. Ultimately, however, the IOC decided in its 123rd session upon three items: that former Dutch Antillean athletes would compete independently under the Olympic flag; that recognition for the Netherlands Antilles' Olympic Committee was to be withdrawn; and that a temporary administrative structure would serve in the Dutch Antillean NOC's place until after the 2012 London games, directly supervised and supported by the IOC.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent to the {{confirmation}} {{of the existence of}} Hurricane Alice, the U.S. Weather Bureau Office in San Juan, Puerto Rico warned the islands of the northern Lesser Antilles to prepare for strong winds and rough seas. Hurricane Alice produced moderate to strong winds across the islands, peaking at 81mph (130km/h) in Saint Barthélemy and 75mph (120km/h) in Saba. The hurricane dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across several islands, including a peak of 11.27inches (286mm) in 48hours recorded at Saba. Due to its small size, only a few islands received significant effects from the hurricane. Saint-Barthélemy, Saba, Anguilla, <b>Sint</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> and Saint Kitts reported damage from the hurricane, totaling $623,500 (1955USD, $4.7million 2006USD). Damage was heaviest on Saba and Anguilla, occurring primarily to shipping facilities and crops. 626houses were destroyed or severely damaged on Anguilla, as well. The damage was caused mostly by heavy rainfall and rough seas, not the direct action of the wind. The passage of Hurricane Alice greatly troubled the economies of the small affected islands. Additionally, the outer rainbands of the storm alleviated dry conditions on Puerto Rico which had persisted since the previous October. No deaths were reported.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlands Antilles were a {{union of}} five Caribbean islandsCuraçao, Bonaire, <b>Sint</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> Saba and Sint Maartenthat, together, {{constituted}} {{a portion of the}} Realm of the Netherlands alongside the Netherlands themselves and Aruba, and held approximately 300,000 residents. The political power of the Dutch colonies was centered at Willemstad, the capital of both Curaçao and of the Netherlands Antilles. The first Dutch Antillean delegation to compete was an eleven-man team that arrived at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. Excluding 1956 and 1980, athletes from the Netherlands Antilles had participated at twelve summer games between 1952 and 2004. It had additionally competed at the Winter Olympics of 1988 and 1992. The first female Dutch Antillean Olympians competed at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, and had only appeared sporadically between then and 2004 with the exception of in 1984, when female athletes comprised the majority of the Dutch Antillean delegation. The Netherlands Antilles experienced its greatest diversity of athletes at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, when athletes participated in six different sports.|$|E
5|$|In addition, many {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches were posted in the Greater and Lesser Antilles. At 2100UTC on August20, a hurricane watch was issued for Sint Maarten, Saba, and <b>Sint</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> {{while there was}} a tropical storm watch for Antigua, Barbuda, and Anguilla. Early on August21, the hurricane watch was expanded to include the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Additionally, the tropical storm watch was extended out to the British Virgin Islands, Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Martin. A hurricane warning was issued for Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands late on August21. In Dominica, both a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch were reported, while a tropical storm watch was put into effect in Dominican Republic. At 0300UTC on August22, a hurricane watch was issued for Haiti north of Port-au-Prince as was a tropical storm warning in Dominican Republic from Palenque to Cabrera. An hour later, a tropical storm watch was put into effect for the southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands. By 0900UTC on August22, Dominican Republic's entire north coast was under a hurricane warning. Additionally, the tropical storm watch for the southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands was upgraded to a hurricane watch.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} warning for Antigua, Barbuda, Guadeloupe, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis was discontinued at 1200UTC on August22, {{as was the}} tropical storm warning for Dominica. Three hours later, a {{hurricane warning}} was issued for the southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands, and another hurricane watch was posted for the central Bahamas. Additionally, the hurricane warning for Saba, <b>Sint</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> Sint Maarten, was discontinued. At 2100UTC on August22, a hurricane watch was issued in Cuba for the provinces of Holguín and Las Tunas, while a tropical storm warning was issued for Haiti north of Port-au-Prince. The hurricane warning for the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico was lowered to a tropical storm warning, before being canceled early on August23. Additionally, all watches and warning east of the United States Virgin Islands were discontinued. On August23, a hurricane warning was issued for the central Bahamas and Cuba in the provinces of Guantanamo, Holguín, and Las Tunas. A hurricane watch was put into effect for the northwestern Bahamas and Cuba in Camagüey and Ciego de Ávila on the north coast and Santiago de Cuba and Granma on the south coast. By 1500UTC on August25, all of the remaining tropical cyclone watches and warnings were cancelled.|$|E

25|$|The name Prince William was {{confirmed}} on 3 April 1780 {{and she was}} fitted and coppered at Portsmouth between April and August 1780. She was commissioned under her first commander, Captain Stair Douglas, in April that year, and joined the Channel Fleet under Sir George Darby. She sailed for the West Indies in November 1780 with the fleet under Sir Samuel Hood, and saw action with the fleet at the capture of <b>Sint</b> <b>Eustatius</b> in February 1781, and at the Battle of Fort Royal on 29/30 April 1781. Prince William then left the West Indies {{at the end of}} the year, sailing to North America and arriving there in October.

25|$|Government-encouraged {{emigration}} {{efforts to}} reduce population density prompted some 500,000 Dutch people {{to leave the country}} after the war. The 1960s and 1970s were a time of great social and cultural change, such as rapid ontzuiling (end of pillarisation), a term that describes the decay of the old divisions along political and religious lines. Youths, and students in particular, rejected traditional mores and pushed for change in matters such as women's rights, sexuality, disarmament and environmental issues. In 2002, the euro was introduced as fiat money and in 2010, the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved. Referendums were held on each island to determine their future status. As a result, the islands of Bonaire, <b>Sint</b> <b>Eustatius</b> and Saba (the BES islands) were to obtain closer ties with the Netherlands. This led to the incorporation of these three islands into the country of the Netherlands as special municipalities upon the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles. The special municipalities are collectively known as the Caribbean Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Bickerton was {{promoted}} to lieutenant on 16 December 1777 and served under Charles Middleton first on board the 90-gun HMS Prince George, then the seventy-four, Royal Oak in March 1778. In May, Bickerton joined HMS Jupiter in the Bay of Biscay, {{under the command of}} Francis Reynolds. On 20 October Jupiter attacked the much larger French ship-of-the-line Triton, forcing her to retire; as a reward for his conduct, Bickerton, on Middleton's recommendation, was in March 1779, promoted master and given command of HM Sloop Swallow. Swallow spent just under two years in The Channel, cruising and undertaking escort duties. While on convoy duty during the Summer of 1779, Bickerton gave the order to disperse, having heard of the arrival of the combined Franco-Spanish fleet in The Channel. His prompt action allowed the convoy to escape.
