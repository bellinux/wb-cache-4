The pathophysiology of hypertension is an area which attempts to explain mechanistically the causes of hypertension, which is a chronic disease characterized by elevation of blood pressure. Hypertension can be classified by cause as either essential (also known as primary or idiopathic) or secondary. About 90–95% of hypertension is essential hypertension. [...] Some authorities define essential hypertension as that which has no known explanation, while others define its cause as being due to overconsumption of sodium and underconsumption of potassium. <b>Secondary</b> <b>hypertension</b> indicates that the hypertension is a result of a specific underlying condition with a well-known mechanism, such as chronic kidney disease, narrowing of the aorta or kidney arteries, or endocrine disorders such as excess aldosterone, cortisol, or catecholamines. Persistent hypertension is a major risk factor for hypertensive heart disease, coronary artery disease, stroke, aortic aneurysm, peripheral artery disease, and chronic kidney disease.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: Primary and <b>secondary</b> {{pulmonary}} <b>hypertension</b> {{have been}} associated with poor outcomes after single lung transplantation. Some groups advocate double lung transplantation and the routine use of cardiopulmonary bypass during transplantation in this population. However, the optimal procedure for these patients remains controversial. The goal of our {{study was to determine the}} safety of single lung transplantation without cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with <b>secondary</b> pulmonary <b>hypertension.</b> Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 76 consecutive patients with pulmonary parenchymal disease who underwent single lung transplantation from 1992 to 1998. Recipients were stratified according to preoperative mean pulmonary artery pressure. <b>Secondary</b> pulmonary <b>hypertension</b> was defined as parenchymal lung disease with a preoperative mean pulmonary artery pressure of 30 mm Hg or more. Patients with primary pulmonary hypertension or Eisenmenger’s syndrome were excluded from analysis. Results: Eighteen of 76 patients had <b>secondary</b> pulmonary <b>hypertension.</b> No patient with <b>secondary</b> pulmonary <b>hypertension</b> required cardiopulmonary bypass, whereas 1 patient without pulmonary hypertension required bypass. After the operation, no significant differences were seen in lung injury as measured by chest radiograph score and PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio, the requirement for inhaled nitric oxide, the length of mechanical ventiliation, the intensive care unit or hospital length of stay, and 30 -day survival. There were no differences in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second or 6 -minute walk at 1 year, or the incidence of rejection, infection, or bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome greater than grade 2. Survival at 1, 2, and 4 years after transplantation was 86 %, 79 %, and 65 %, respectively, in the low pulmonary artery pressure group and 81 %, 81 %, and 61 %, respectively, in the group with <b>secondary</b> pulmonary <b>hypertension</b> (P >. 2). Conclusion: We found that patients with pulmonary parenchymal disease and concomitant <b>secondary</b> pulmonary <b>hypertension</b> had successful outcomes as measured by early and late allograft function and appear to have acceptable long-term survival after single lung transplantation. Our results do not support the routine use of cardiopulmonary bypass or double lung transplantation for patients with this disorder. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2000; 119 : 458 - 65...|$|R

Other causes of <b>secondary</b> <b>hypertension</b> include obesity, sleep apnea, pregnancy, coarctation of the aorta, excessive eating of liquorice, excessive drinking of alcohol, and certain prescription medicines, herbal remedies and illegal drugs.

Laboratory tests can also be performed to identify possible causes of <b>secondary</b> <b>hypertension,</b> and to determine whether hypertension has caused damage to the heart, eyes, and kidneys.

50|$|Thiazide diuretics are effective, {{recommended}} as {{the best}} first-line drug for hypertension by many experts, and are much more affordable than other therapies, yet they are not prescribed as often as some newer drugs.

Doses in excess of 25 milligrams per day of this agent incur an unacceptable risk of low potassium or Hypokalemia.

Hyperthyroidism frequently causes weight loss with increased appetite, fast heart rate, bulging eyes, and tremor. Renal artery stenosis (RAS) {{may be associated with}} a localized abdominal bruit to the left or right of the midline (unilateral RAS), or in both locations (bilateral RAS). Coarctation of the aorta frequently causes a decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities relative to the arms, or delayed or absent femoral arterial pulses.
