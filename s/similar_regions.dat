5|$|Each of Sweden's 21 {{counties}} (län), 25 provinces (landskap) and 290 municipalities (kommun) {{has its own}} coat of arms. The Instrument of Government (1634) {{introduced the}} modern counties of Sweden, superseding the 25 medieval provinces. Although many of these counties {{have been the subject}} of more recent reforms, many of them occupy broadly <b>similar</b> <b>regions.</b> (See comparative maps at Counties of Sweden.) Most of the counties that have remained largely intact (Dalarna, Gotland, Skåne, Södermanland, Uppsala, Värmland, etc.) retain the respective province's coat of arms, while the redistricting of other lands has been reflected heraldically (e.g. the newly created Gävleborgs län, occupying parts of Hälsingland and Gästrikland, bears their arms quarterly). By royal decree on 18 January 1884, King Oscar II granted all provinces the rights to the rank of duchy and to display their arms with a ducal coronet. While more exhaustive lists can be found elsewhere, this article only discusses the arms of a few of these regions, selected for their heraldic notability. The arms of Gotland, Västerbotten, Uppland, Södermanland, Skåne and Lappland will be considered here in further detail.|$|E

25|$|The {{absence of}} {{mosquitoes}} from Iceland and <b>similar</b> <b>regions</b> is {{probably because of}} quirks of their climate, which differs in some respects from mainland regions. At {{the start of the}} uninterrupted continental winter of Greenland and the northern regions of Eurasia and America, the pupa enters diapause under the ice that covers sufficiently deep water. The imago ecloses only after the ice breaks in late spring. In Iceland however, the weather is less predictable. In mid-winter it frequently warms up suddenly, causing the ice to break, but then to freeze again after a few days. By that time the mosquitoes will have emerged from their pupae, but the new freeze sets in before they can complete their life cycle. Any anautogenous adult mosquito would need a host to supply a blood meal before it could lay viable eggs; it would need time to mate, mature the eggs and oviposit in suitable wetlands. These requirements would not be realistic in Iceland and in fact the absence of mosquitoes from such subpolar islands is in line with the islands' low biodiversity; Iceland has fewer than 1,500 described species of insects, many of them probably accidentally introduced by human agency. In Iceland most ectoparasitic insects live in sheltered conditions or actually on mammals; examples include lice, fleas and bedbugs, in whose living conditions freezing is no concern, and most of which were introduced inadvertently by humans.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an updated}} version of SAM, {{pre-existing}} semantic associations are accounted for using a semantic matrix. [...] During the experiment, semantic associations remain fixed showing the assumption that semantic associations are not significantly impacted by the episodic experience of one experiment. [...] The two measures used to measure semantic relatedness in this model are the Latent semantic analysis (LSA) and the Word association spaces (WAS). The LSA method states that similarity between words is reflected through their co-occurrence in a local context. WAS was developed by analyzing a database of free association norms. [...] In WAS, [...] "words that have similar associative structures are placed in <b>similar</b> <b>regions</b> of space." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Image Segmentation is a {{technique}} that partitioned the digital image into many number of homogeneous regions or sets of homogeneous pixels is called image segmentation. Efficient and effective image segmentation is an important task in computer vision and object recognition. Since fully automatic image segmentation is usually very hard for natural images, interactive schemes with a few simple user inputs are good solutions. In this paper we presents image segmentation using <b>similar</b> <b>region</b> merging and comparison among different interactive image segmentation techniques. Segmentation should stop as object of interest in an application is isolated. The {{ultimate goal is to}} make the image more simplified and that to get more meaningful to analyze. This paper deals with the several segmentation techniques using human interactions models like PGM, Bayesian Networks Unified Graphical Models, <b>Similar</b> <b>region</b> merging etc., are taken from the literature are reviewed and a new interactive method of image segmentation is proposed using <b>similar</b> <b>region</b> merging...|$|R
