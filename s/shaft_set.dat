2500|$|The cenotaph ("empty tomb") {{is almost}} {{identical}} to that on Whitehall, except that it is reduced to two-thirds scale and is not adorned by flags. Built from Portland stone, it consists of a chest tomb, covered by a moulded laurel wreath, {{at the top of}} a three-staged rectangular base. The base sits on top of the large rectangular <b>shaft,</b> <b>set</b> back slightly towards the top, which itself rests on a two-stage base of rectangular blocks. The whole structure stands on a base of three shallow steps, typical of Lutyens' war memorials. Decorations on the memorial are sparse, consisting solely of a moulded laurel wreath on the two sides, below which are inscribed the dates of the two world wars (inscriptions for the Second World War were added later). The two faces contain the only inscriptions: [...] "THE GLORIOUS DEAD / OF THE QUEEN'S OWN ROYAL WEST KENT REGIMENT / NUMBERING 6866 OF ALL RANKS / ALSO NUMBERING 1663 OF ALL RANKS".|$|E

The [...] "Fire Zouave" [...] figure is in close combat with the enemy, swinging his rifle as a club. The monument was designed by Captain John Reed (the 72nd veteran who was arrested), but only the last name of the sculptor is known: Stephens. The sculpture was cast by the Bureau Brothers Foundry in Philadelphia.|$|E
50|$|In {{the centre}} of the village stands the church of St Margaret of Antioch. The Grade I listed {{building}} is essentially of the Norman Conquest period, built using a mixture of Anglo-Saxon and Norman styles. Much of the work of these periods is still retained. It has an 11th-century tower of herringbone pattern masonry, a Saxon cross <b>shaft</b> <b>set</b> in an outer wall and an ancient carved crucifix within. The tall cross in the churchyard is used as a war memorial and it is thought to be a former Medieval market buttercross.|$|E
50|$|Mab's {{cross is}} a {{scheduled}} ancient monument. The monument is {{the remains of}} a 13th-century boundary cross in Standishgate, Wigan. The cross was moved from a site {{on the opposite side of}} the road in the early-20th century. The grade II* listed structure has a metre-square, 0.57 m high dressed plinth made of two courses of rectangular gritstone blocks. Mounted diagonally on the plinth is a large square cross base with the stump of the cross <b>shaft</b> <b>set</b> into it. On the plinth is a metal plaque relating the legend of Lady Mabel Bradshaigh.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the building is H-shaped in plan and was originally designed to provide space for the Customs Service and the Post Office. Extant original elements include the elaborate cast-iron, double-return stair leading to the second floor. The stair's ornamental newel posts have an acanthus motif and fluted <b>shafts</b> <b>set</b> on octagonal bases. The cast-iron risers are pierced with a circular fret design.|$|R

50|$|The house {{stands on}} Nell Lane, just {{north-east}} of Barlow Moor Road. Behind it runs {{the route of}} the Metrolink to East Didsbury and Manchester Airport, and Chorlton Brook runs past it on the north side (Mauldeth Road West passes it on the southern side). It is a brick, three-storey brick building with gabled wings which are ornamented with balls. The central portion of the house is surmounted with a parapet in the form of three smaller gables with similar finials. The chimneys are square <b>shafts</b> <b>set</b> diagonally on square bases.|$|R
50|$|Where {{the shaft}} {{is to be}} used for {{hoisting}} it is frequently split into multiple compartments by Shaft Sets, these may be made of either timber or steel. Vertical members in a <b>shaft</b> <b>set</b> are called Guides, horizontal members are called Buntons. For steel shaft guides, the main two options are hollow structural sections and top hat sections. Top hat sections offer a number of advantages over hollow structural sections including simpler installation, improved corrosion resistance and increased stiffness. Mine conveyances run on the guides in a similar way to how a steel roller coaster runs on its rails, both having wheels which keep them securely in place.|$|E
5000|$|Ryan was {{in charge}} of {{lighting}} for the New York Hudson-Fulton Celebration of 1909, and for this lighted up all the major buildings, East River bridges, public places, and some stretches of the coastline of Manhattan. He installed colored searchlights on the Singer Building. The tower was reportedly visible from 40 miles away, and made a great impression:What every one of the visitors paused to gaze at was the Singer Building tower ... The main building was dark and gloomy, but from its center sprang a terra-cotta <b>shaft</b> <b>set</b> off with pale green pilasters rising to a golden cornice. The lights which illuminated it could not be seen, but it glowed against the sky.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the churchyard}} are two monuments, {{each of which}} has been scheduled. One is known as the Giant's Grave, and dates from the 10th century. [...] It {{consists}} of two Anglo-Saxon cross shafts and four hogbacks, which have been in their present arrangement since at least 1664-65. [...] The other, known as the Giant's Thumb, also dates from the 10th century. It consists of a single sandstone Anglo-Saxon cross <b>shaft</b> <b>set</b> on a modern sandstone base, which was erected here in 1887. It has a wheel head, and carving on its sides. [...] Also in the churchyard is a monument dated 1846 to the memory of those who built the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway in Gothic Revival style, listed at Grade II, and a war memorial dated 1919 {{in the form of a}} Celtic cross.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} eight Type XB boats were produced, which {{replaced}} the mine {{chamber of the}} projected Type XA with six vertical wet storage shafts in the forward section of the hull. Up to 18 mines could be carried in these shafts, with an additional 48 mines {{in a series of}} 12 <b>shafts</b> <b>set</b> into the saddle tanks on each side. They only had two torpedo tubes, both at the stern. When used as cargo-carrying submarines they carried freight containers in the mine shafts (or had the freight containers welded on top of the lateral shafts, preventing their use for mines).|$|R
50|$|The Cherry Mine {{had been}} opened in 1905 by the St. Paul Coal Company to supply coal for the trains of its {{controlling}} company, the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad. The mine {{consisted of three}} horizontal veins, each deeper than the last. The veins were connected vertically by two <b>shafts</b> <b>set</b> some 100 yards apart. Both the main shaft and the secondary shaft contained wooden stairs and ladders. The main shaft was capped by an 85-foot steel tower which controlled a mechanical hoisting cage. A large fan, located in a shunt off the secondary shaft, pushed fresh air into the mine.|$|R

50|$|Designed {{and built}} by the English Electric Co., four steam turbine units of high pressure, {{intermediate}} pressure and double-flow low pressure turbine cylinders were coupled to 250 MW generators. The steam flow into the turbine was regulated by the hydraulically controlled steam inlet valves to maintain a generating speed of 3000 RPM. The turbine over-speed protection was by weight eccentric rings on the turbine <b>shaft,</b> <b>set</b> to throw-out at a predetermined RPM and shutting the HP cylinder inlet steam valves. Exhaust flow from the HP turbine cylinders passed to the boiler for reheating (with some having been bled off to feed heaters), returned to the IP cylinder (with some bled off to LP feed heaters) and exhausted from the double-flow LP cylinder under vacuum into underslung water-cooled condensers. Condenser cooling water was delivered from a sub-basement ring main around the turbine house. The turbine/generator assembly was mounted on reinforced concrete pedestals that ran {{along the length of}} the turbine hall.|$|E
50|$|The scrap basket is {{then taken}} to the melt shop, the roof is swung off the furnace, and the furnace is charged with scrap from the basket. Charging {{is one of the}} more {{dangerous}} operations for the EAF operators. A lot of potential energy is released by the tonnes of falling metal; any liquid metal in the furnace is often displaced upwards and outwards by the solid scrap, and the grease and dust on the scrap is ignited if the furnace is hot, resulting in a fireball erupting. In some twin-shell furnaces, the scrap is charged into the second shell while the first is being melted down, and pre-heated with off-gas from the active shell. Other operations are continuous charging—pre-heating scrap on a conveyor belt, which then discharges the scrap into the furnace proper, or charging the scrap from a <b>shaft</b> <b>set</b> above the furnace, with off-gases directed through the shaft. Other furnaces can be charged with hot (molten) metal from other operations.|$|E

5000|$|The Samuel Badger Monument {{is located}} in a small private {{cemetery}} in a residential area of Kittery Foreside, a village of Kittery {{on the banks of the}} Piscataqua River, not far from Badger's Island. The cemetery has a small number of graves, which all appear to be related to Samuel Badger and his immediate family, many of whom predeceased him. The cemetery is surrounded by houses, and is not readily accessible to the public. The monument is a stepped rectangular granite <b>shaft,</b> <b>set</b> on a granite foundation. In a niche on one side with a curved ceiling stands a marble bust of Badger. The tier at the base of the shaft has the Badger name in raised letters, and the next tier depicts a 19th-century sailing ship. The shaft is topped by a low gabled pediment with a star at its center. [...] The bust of Badger was designed by David M. French of Newmarket, New Hampshire, and was installed in 1858. The circumstances of its commissioning are not known.|$|E
50|$|A {{set screw}} {{is a type}} of screw {{generally}} used to secure an object within or against another object, normally not using a nut (see bolts compared with screws). The most common examples are securing a pulley or gear to a <b>shaft.</b> <b>Set</b> screws are usually headless (also called blind), meaning that the screw is fully threaded and has no head projecting past the major diameter of the screw thread. If a set screw has a head, the thread will extend {{all the way to the}} head (whereas a bolt might have an unthreaded shank between the head and thread). A blind set screw (known in the UK as a grub screw, quite possibly from its figurative resemblance to a soil-dwelling grub) is almost always driven with an internal-wrenching drive, such as a hex socket (Allen), star (Torx), square socket (Robertson), or slot. The set screw passes through a threaded hole in the outer object and is tightened against the inner object to prevent it from moving relative to the outer object. It exerts compressional or clamping force through the bottom tip that projects through the hole.|$|E

50|$|Of that troublous period which {{extended}} {{to the time of}} Charlemagne and later until the beginning of Romanesque art, few monuments remain that give a clear conception of the window architecture then in vogue. According to Haupt's researches, the windows of the earliest Germanic churches had a round arch above, which was generally a hollowed stone. Towards the bottom these windows, strange to say, were frequently somewhat broader than above. It was not unusual in Spain, England, and France to finish the window-casement with a horseshoe arch, the upper part being formed by two stone <b>shafts</b> <b>set</b> obliquely, that is, like ribs of an arch. An example of this method is found at Deerhurst in England. The windows of this period are frequently very different on the inner and outer sides, the richer ornamentation being found on the inner side, as at Saint-Germain-des-Prés in France where there are engaged columns and ornamented archivolts.|$|R

Experiments show that kerosene based magnetic fluid has very high polishing performance compared with water based one. The usage of coarse grain gives rise to increase the surface roughnes, and larger clearance between specimen and copper rotary disc lowers finishing rate of wafer in kerosene based magnetic fluid especially. Movement of permanent magnet in copper rotary disc is very effective for finishing of wafer...|$|E
