50|$|The {{degrees of}} any reducibility {{relation}} are partially {{ordered by the}} relation in the following manner. Let ≤ be a reducibility relation and let A and B be two of its degrees. Then A ≤ B {{if and only if}} there is <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>A</b> <b>in</b> <b>A</b> and <b>a</b> <b>set</b> B <b>in</b> B such that A ≤ B. This is equivalent to the property that for every <b>set</b> <b>A</b> <b>in</b> <b>A</b> and every <b>set</b> B <b>in</b> B, <b>A</b> ≤ B, because any two <b>sets</b> <b>in</b> <b>A</b> are equivalent and any two <b>sets</b> <b>in</b> B are equivalent. It is common, as shown here, to use boldface notation to denote degrees.|$|R
