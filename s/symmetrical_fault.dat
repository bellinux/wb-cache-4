This paper proposes an adaptive concentric power swing blocker (PSB) to overcome incapability of traditional concentric PSB in detecting <b>symmetrical</b> <b>fault</b> during power swing.

Second concentric characteristic records travelling time of impedance trajectory between outer and inner zones and compares to threshold value to detect <b>symmetrical</b> <b>fault</b> during power swing.

40|$|This Master's thesis investigates a new {{application}} for the matrix converter: Shunt reactive power compensation. The suggested Matrix Converter-based Reactive power Compensation (MCRC) device {{is composed of}} a matrix converter, which input {{is connected to the}} grid and an electric machine at the output of the converter. The reactive power flowing in or out of the grid can be regulated with the matrix converter by controlling the magnitude and/or phase angle of the current at the input of the converter. The matrix converter has no bulky DC link capacitor like traditional AC-DC-AC converters. The thought electric machine is a Permanent Magnet (PM) synchronous machine which is compact as well, yielding an overall compact device. The main focus of the thesis is to evaluate the reactive power range that the MCRC device can offer. The reactive power range depends mainly on the modulation of the matrix converter. Two different modulation techniques are studied: the indirect virtual space vector modulation and the three-vector-scheme. The indirect space vector modulation can provide or draw reactive power at the input of the matrix converter {{as long as there is}} an active power flow through the converter that is different from zero. For pure reactive power compensation the indirect space vector modulation cannot be used and the three-vector-scheme must be used instead. Both modulation techniques are presented in details as well as their reactive power compensation range. To verify the reactive power capabilities of the device, three different simulation models are built in MATLAB Simulink. The first simulation model represents the MCRC device with the matrix converter modulated with the indirect space vector modulation. The second model represents also the MCRC device with the matrix converter modulated with the three-vector-scheme. In both model the PM machine is represented by a simple equivalent circuit. Simulations done with both models show a good accordance between the theoretical analysis of the device and the experimental results. The last simulation model features a simplified version of the MCRC system connected to a grid where a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>fault</b> occurs.

40|$|The {{definition}} of adequate Grid Codes {{is essential to}} ensure an efficient and secure operation of offshore wind farms and their integration into the interconnected electricity system. The German Ordinance on System Services by Wind Energy Plants (SDLWindV) as legal base for the corresponding Grid Codes demands wind turbine generators (WTG) and the whole farm to provide {{a wide range of}} reactive power supply. Furthermore fault-ride-through (FRT) capabilities are requested, i. e. the ability to keep connected in case of faults and to adjust active and reactive power supply as response to grid voltage and frequency deviations within a short-time frame. While these requirements have their justification in supporting AC-onshore-grids, it has to be analysed whether the potential of the WTGs can be exploited in offshore wind farms coupled by Voltage Source Converter-based High Voltage Direct Current links (VSC HVDC). Subsequently it is to discuss if a simplification of the Grid Codes in accordance with the secure and efficient integration of a VSC-based HVDC connected wind farm is possible. For the studies carried out in this paper, an offshore wind farm model is presented, which consists of 40 single wind turbines with FRT-capable doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG) and a VSC-based HVDC link to the onshore grid. The VSC-based HVDC is equipped with a control strategy to handle offshore and onshore faults. The offshore converter works as a reference machine while the onshore converter operates with a Vdc/Vac control scheme, designed for an appropriate integration into the interconnected electricity system. Various cases with different control strategies, such as Q(U) or fixed Q control, were investigated to study the steady-state offshore grid operation and the corresponding fault behaviour. Results indicate the possibility to operate the offshore grid in steady-state on a low loss level while maintaining good voltage quality with a distinctly tighter P-Q-range of the WTG than required from the Grid Codes with limited impact on the dynamic behaviour. It can be demonstrated that voltage drops during a three phase (<b>symmetrical)</b> <b>fault</b> as well as the voltage recovering time are mostly independent from the pre-fault reactive power supply. The latter is dominated by the offshore converter and the requested WTG reactive current support during faults.

30|$|For {{obtaining the}} {{complete}} fault {{information on the}} transmission line, a fault location technique has been presented which does not require any additional information beyond the synchrophasor measurements that are utilized for fault detection and classification. Fault location techniques proposed in earlier works [16 â€“ 18] employ sophisticated algorithms to locate a fault. The most commonly used fault location techniques are impedance-based fault location methods. Single-ended impedance-based fault location algorithm techniques have several disadvantages [29]. They only work when the fault voltages and currents recorded by the PMU correspond to the faulted line. They also provide inaccurate results {{in the presence of}} tapped lines or three terminal lines. This situation necessitates the need for double ended fault location algorithms which are highly accurate but need measurements from both ends of the line. This can only be achieved when PMUs are present in all the buses. Hence, the proposed scheme takes advantage of data available from each bus of the system to enable accurate fault location. The voltage and current phasors at the two buses in the faulted branch (termed hereafter as Bus a and Bus b) are taken. From these phasor quantities, the positive sequence components of the voltage and current phasors are extracted. Here, the positive sequence components are used because they are non-zero for all types of faults (zero sequence components do not exist for non-ground faults and negative sequence components do not exist for <b>symmetrical</b> <b>faults).</b>|$|R
40|$|Power system {{stabilizers}} {{and other}} controllers are employed to damp oscillations in power systems, thereby guaranteeing satisfactory dynamic performance following major network disturbances. However, {{the parameters of}} these controllers are often tuned based on the power system linearized model which generally {{is a function of}} the system operating point or state. These controllers suffer from poor performance when the system state changes. The aim of the research work reported in this Thesis is to develop nonlinear synchronous generator excitation control schemes with control laws for providing improved transient stability when the system is subjected to wide parameter variations due to network disturbances. The study employed fourth-and third-order models of a single-machine-connected-to-an-infinite-bus system to design two nonlinear sliding mode control laws (CLs) and one finite-time homogeneous control law (CL), which were constructed based on a well-chosen output function of the system. The parameters of the control laws were properly selected and/or tuned to give desirable dynamic characteristics using well established linear control methods. Justifications for the selection of the fourth-and third-order synchronous generator models to design the aforesaid controllers are presented. Dynamic simulations of the system under the action of the control laws were carried out using MATLABÂ®/SIMULINK. In order to test the performance of the laws, several simulation studies were performed when the voltage magnitude (V) of the infinite bus and the transmission line reactance (XE) of the system changed due to an applied three-phase <b>symmetrical</b> <b>fault</b> at the infinite bus and generator terminals. Results obtained from these studies show that the dynamic characteristics of the system being investigated have improved significantly, in terms of the rotor angle and rotor speed first peak, damping of low-frequency mechanical oscillations in rotor angle following fault clearance, and settling times of key stability indicators (rotor angle and rotor speed). For instance, for application of each of 5 -cycle, 7 -cycle, and 9 -cycle fault at the infinite bus, the system rotor angle settled to its stable steady values within 1 - 2. 2 s with minimal control effort that varied between - 5 pu and 5 pu before settling at the prefault value of 1. 5603 pu in 4. 32 s (CL 1), in 1. 92 s (CL 2), and in 3. 32 s (CL 3). Whereas, CL 3, which is a contribution to the improvement of the existing general higher-order sliding mode control structure for synchronous excitation control, was able to make the system withstand greater fault duration than CL 1, CL 2, which has a new positive parameter (called the dilation gain) incorporated into it, furnished the system with the greatest fault-retaining capability.

40|$|Power grid {{protection}} {{aim is to}} {{make the}} generation, transmission and distribution of electrical energy as safe as possible from the effects of equipment failures. The operational security of the power system depends on the successful operation of the thousands of relays that protect power elements and hence protect the whole system against cascading failures. Thus, the failure of a relay to operate asintended may place at risk the entire power system and its elements. In conventional transmission line protection, a distance relay is used to provide the primary as well as backup protection. The voltage and current phasors measurement needed by the distance relay for determining the impedance may be affected by the power disturbances such as power swing. Consequently, this power swing may cause mal-operation of Zone three distance relays which in turn may affect on the reliability of the whole protective scheme. The mal-operation of this relay is generally due to not only unnecessary tripping during power swing that reduces the security of protection system and hence its reliability but also unnecessary blocking when <b>symmetrical</b> <b>fault</b> occurs accompanying a power swing. This latter action may affect on a dependability of the relay and hence its reliability. Many techniques have been developed to mitigate these effects and hence improve the relay reliability. One of the earliest techniques is the using of a negative sequence current magnitude and a derivative of current angle. This technique is very fast and its test results were promising in blocking false trip signals during power swing but when it is associated only with unsymmetrical faults. A combination of waveform of swing centerâ€™s voltage (WSCV) and synthetic negative vector has been also utilized to block the tripping signals during power swing. The technique seems to be rigorous indiscriminating power swing and high fault resistance. However, it requires two computationallyheavy steps of derivative operation. There is also a time delay of about 30 - 40 ms before a power swing blocking scheme can be activated and hence the method is relatively slow. In order to improve the reliability of the relay, this work proposes a new scheme based on powerswing detector using Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). In addition to the local phasors information, the proposed scheme requires remote phasors information from different locations, which can be provided at high speed by PMUs. These measurements are used for calculating the power and the difference in phase voltages angles that may be used for detecting power swing and distinguishing it from the fault. This detector will not block relay when the power swing associated with any fault types. The MHO relay including power swing detector has been implemented using Simulink block set and S-function. To validate the present work, the performance of developed relay has been tested by signals generated by power network Simulink model running under different conditions. The test results show that this relay provides good discrimination between the transient high currents and the fault current. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{has looked}} upon the fault ride through {{capability}} assessment for small-scale hydro {{power plants in}} the distribution grid. In this report, {{the shape of the}} voltage dip has been studied, and the voltage angle impact on critical clearing time has been analyzed. A model of the SnÃ¥sa grid has been used to study faults with the simulation program SIMPOW. The SINTEF DipLab has been simulated, and the results from simulations have been compared to measurements made during experiments at Bruvollelva power plant. An in-house lab has been built to study the significance of the surrounding grid, as a weaker grid connection theoretically increases the voltage angle fluctuations, and hence decreases the critical clearing time of the generator. When studying the voltage dips caused by three phase symmetrical faults in the distribution grid, the location of the fault has proven to be important. One of the reasons is the difference in voltage angle. The voltage dips with origin in a fault in a parallel radial to the point of measurement gives a small fluctuation in voltage angle, while faults between the point of measurement and the swing bus creates larger changes in voltage angle. The reason is that the whole load flow changes when the swing bus is disconnected, and the DG units have to cover all the demand. The critical clearing time for the distributed generating unit Bruvollelva was simulated in this report for two different cases. A <b>symmetrical</b> <b>fault</b> was implemented, and the same voltage profile was then implemented without the same voltage angle response. The increase in critical clearing time was about 20 % for the voltage dips with origin between the DG unit and the swing bus, while the increase was much lower for the faults with origin in a parallel radial. A correlation can be seen, as the faults leading to the highest fluctuations in voltage angle was the same faults that gave the largest increases in clearing time. This indicates that the voltage angle has a considerable impact on the critical clearing times of the machine, and hence a considerable impact on the fault ride through capability assessment. The implementation guidelines for network codes amplifies the importance of the short-circuit capacity at the connection point in the pre-fault and post-fault condition. The robustness of the network has significant impact of the FRT performance, and a minimum requirement for short circuit capacity should be defined in the national FRT restrictions. An in-house lab was built to verify the results from the simulations. The outcome was surprising, as a weak grid connection lead to a clearing time of 600 ms when the generator was operating at 7 Nm, while the stronger grid connection made the generator trip at 500 ms. The experiments should however have been made with a longer cable, and should be repeated to increase the credibility of the results. Another verification of the simulation model was made when the measurements from the experiments made at Bruvollelva was compared to simulations. The results showed that the voltage dips were similar. Protection relays should also have been implemented to the simulations model, as they were a limiting factor {{when it came to the}} clearing time of the fault. Generally, the measured dips caused by the DipLab were more square shaped than the simulated dips. It has been showed that the voltage due to a three phase fault is less square shaped at the generator nodes than in the rest of the system due to a higher inductance in the short circuit impedance. This is especially the case for periods with high production...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{carried out}} in this thesis was mainly concerned {{with the effects of}} large induction motors and their transient performance in power systems. Computer packages using the three phase co-ordinate frame of reference were developed to simulate the induction motor transient performance. A technique using matrix algebra was developed to allow extension of the three phase co-ordinate method to analyse asymmetrical and <b>symmetrical</b> <b>faults</b> {{on both sides of the}} three phase delta-star transformer which is usually required when connecting large induction motors to the supply system. System simulation, applying these two techniques, was used to study the transient stability of a power system. The response of a typical system, loaded with a group of large induction motors, two three-phase delta-star transformers, a synchronous generator and an infinite system was analysed. The computer software developed to study this system has the advantage that different types of fault at different locations can be studied by simple changes in input data. The research also involved investigating the possibility of using different integrating routines such as Runge-Kutta-Gill, RungeKutta-Fehlberg and the Predictor-Corrector methods. The investigation enables the reduction of computation time, which is necessary when solving the induction motor equations expressed in terms of the three phase variables. The outcome of this investigation was utilised in analysing an introductory model (containing only minimal control action) of an isolated system having a significant induction motor load compared to the size of the generator energising the system...|$|R
