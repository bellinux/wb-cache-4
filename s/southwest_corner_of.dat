5|$|Banksia sessilis is {{endemic to}} the Southwest Botanical Province, a floristic {{province}} renowned as a biodiversity hotspot, {{located in the}} <b>southwest</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> Western Australia. This area has a Mediterranean climate, with wet winters and hot, dry summers. B.sessilis occurs {{throughout much of the}} province, ranging from Kalbarri in the north, south to Cape Leeuwin, east along the south coast as far as Bremer Bay, and inland to Wongan Hills and Kulin. It thus spans a wide range of climates, occurring in all but the semi-arid areas well inland. It is also absent from the Karri forest in the cool, wet, <b>southwest</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the province, but even there, B.sessilis var. cordata occurs along the coast.|$|E

5|$|An old {{belief is}} that the <b>southwest</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> a {{basement}} provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under a staircase, or under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases chances of survival.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} impressive {{scale and}} richly ornamented interior design elements remain intact. Mosaic tile ceilings, cantilevered marble staircases, {{and much of}} the original decorative artwork and furnishings are still in place. The major interior spaces of the building are the first-floor lobbies and connecting corridor and the original courtrooms at the southeast and <b>southwest</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the second floor. The exterior entry doors at the southeast and <b>southwest</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the first floor open into barrel-vaulted corridors with white marble walls and brown and green marble pilasters and columns. The corridors lead to vaulted octagonal vestibules that feature red marble walls and gray Tuscan columns, as well as Roman-style mosaics on the ceilings. Arched openings of the octagonal vestibules lead to lobbies with elevators and grand staircases, and to the quadripart vaulted connecting corridor. The semicircular marble staircases are among the finest examples of cantilevered (supported only from one end) stone stairs in the United States.|$|R
2500|$|The fort's main {{armament}} {{was a pair}} of 24-pounder iron cannon {{mounted on}} the southeast and <b>southwest</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the ramparts.
