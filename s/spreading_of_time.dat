50|$|Aside {{from the}} {{collaboration}} {{that can be}} a product of this type of study, there are many scholars who find fault with biohistory. One major critique of biohistory is the continued repetition of ideas from scholar to scholar. In a review of Stephen Boyden’s book, Western Civilization in the Biological Perspective: Patterns in Biohistory, one such scholar states that “readers who are familiar with other works in biohistory by René Dubos, D. B. Grigg, C.J. Glacken, Donald Worster, and William McNeill will find little that is new.”Another critique is that biohistory encompasses too vast a scope. To start {{from the beginning of the}} human condition creates too wide a <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> leaving room for much speculation. That is because there is not much data and knowledge about the early times studied, leading biohistorians to speculate and possibly make invalid assumptions. Another critique is that many biohistorians rely on too much science in their research. In trying to make assertions about certain historical issues, many are limited in their areas of study to just focusing on scientific aspects while leaving out others.|$|R

The present study was aimed to investigate the potential involvement of AMPK, an energy sensor which plays a pivotal role in energy homeostasis, in the distinct performance <b>of</b> the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> hatching <b>time</b> model. As a result, hypothalamic AMPKα 1 isoform gene expression was significantly higher in the late hatcher as compared to that of their early counterparts, whereas the total and phosphorylated levels of AMPKα subunit did not differ between the three hatchers. The hypothalamic orexigenic NPY and AgRP mRNA levels were higher in the late hatchers as compared to the early, and that of the middle hatchers was at an intermediate level. However, the anorexigenic POMC and CRH was also higher expressed in the late hatchers as compared to the early hatchers. In the liver, AMPKα 2 mRNA level and the phosphorylation ratio of AMPKα was significantly lower in the late hatchers, as compared to their early counterparts. The hepatic phosphorylated GS levels of the late and middle hatchers were lower than that of their early counterparts. The expression of hepatic FTO gene of the late hatchers was significantly higher than that of their early and middle counterparts. Taken together, AMPK may {{play a significant role in}} the different neonatal performance <b>of</b> the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> hatching <b>time</b> model.
