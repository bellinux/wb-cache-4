5|$|Police {{determined}} {{that there were}} 32 clomethiazole pills in Moon's system. Six were digested, sufficient to cause his death; the other 26 were undigested when he died. Max Glatt, an authority on alcoholism, wrote in The Sunday Times that Moon <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> given the drug. Moon was cremated on 13 September 1978 at Golders Green Crematorium in London, and his ashes were scattered in its Gardens of Remembrance.|$|E
5|$|Amnesty International {{called the}} {{conviction}} “a bitter blow {{for freedom of}} expression”. Hugh Williamson, of Human Rights Watch, stated that the “charges and verdict … distort both {{the facts and the}} law.... These women <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> charged with a hate crime and should be released immediately.” ARTICLE 19, Freedom House, and the International Federation for Human Rights also issued statements condemning the sentence. On September 21, 2012, the Feminist Press published an e-book entitled Pussy Riot! A Punk Prayer for Freedom to raise funds for the legal defense team.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{spends the}} rest of the episode working in an improv comedy group with Quagmire and Joe. Quagmire {{attempts}} to educate the others on the fine art of improv comedy but when they try to do a live show, Peter's lack of conscious comedic knowledge completely gives way to his John Wayne impersonations, which the audience finds hilarious. This, along with Joe's fecal incontinence, forces Quagmire to end the show early and conclude {{that this is something that}} <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> attempted.|$|E
5000|$|Buchanan {{thinks that}} Czechoslovakia <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> created, it was [...] "a living contradiction of the principle" [...] of self-determination, with the Czechs ruling [...] "Germans, Hungarians, Slovaks, Poles, and Ruthenians" [...] in a [...] "multi-ethnic, multilingual, multicultural, Catholic-Protestant {{conglomeration}} that <b>had</b> <b>never</b> before existed." [...] Buchanan accuses Czech leaders Josef Beneš and Tomas Masaryk of deceiving the Allies, particularly US President Woodrow Wilson, on the ethnicity of the regions that became Czechoslovakia. [...] "Asked {{why he had}} consigned three million Germans to Czech rule, Wilson blurted, 'Why, Masaryk never told me that!'" ...|$|R
5000|$|In January 2016, investigative news site Exaro leaked {{extracts}} of Smith's report. The extracts detailed numerous sex offences allegedly {{committed by}} Savile, all [...] "in some way {{associated with the}} BBC", and concluded {{that it was possible}} that a predatory child sex offender could be [...] "lurking undiscovered" [...] even today, but stopped short of criticizing the BBC for failing to uncover Savile's behavior. Smith responded by stating that the leaked draft <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> made public as it was out of date and unreliable. Early that week, police confirmed they were no longer concerned about the review prejudicing ongoing investigations.|$|R

[...] "Maria Clutterbuck was my early friend, and though words <b>have</b> <b>been</b> spoken which <b>never</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> spoken, and though things <b>have</b> <b>been</b> done which <b>never</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> even dreamed of, still I will not desert Maria Clutterbuck in her hour of need. No, never!" ...|$|R
5|$|Around {{the time}} of Kameo release, lead {{designer}} George Andreas felt that the original Kameo concept of finding and using monsters had evolved and carried through to the final product. He {{said that there were}} enough ideas for a sequel within the new intellectual property if players were interested. Years later, Andreas reappraised and said that the game <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> released and remains a sore subject for him to discuss. Since the project was nearly finished, they had opted for launch title release instead of starting over. Andreas felt that the effort to conceal the fairy Kameo as an elf was unsuccessful and that the character did not match the Xbox's first-person shooter demographic.|$|E
25|$|Tsarnaev's lawyer, Judy Clarke, {{indicated}} two strong {{lines of}} likely appeal: that on prejudicial grounds the trial <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> held in Boston; {{and that the}} defense was given insufficient time to mount a full argument in mitigation that might have convinced the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. The appeal process could last years or decades.|$|E
25|$|Sri Lanka {{made two}} change – {{swapping}} out the underperforming Jehan Mubarak for Tillakaratne Dilshan, a three-dimensional player who many believe <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{dropped from the}} side. His good batting record, useful bowling ability and world class fielding is nearly always an asset to Sri Lanka when {{he is on the}} team. The other change was to swap the injured Dilhara Fernando for a debutant, Chanaka Welegedara.|$|E

25|$|As an attorney, Jefferson {{represented}} {{people of}} color as well as whites. In 1770, he defended a young mulatto male slave in a freedom suit, {{on the grounds that}} his mother was white and freeborn. By the colony's law of partus sequitur ventrum, that the child took the status of the mother, the man <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> enslaved. He lost the suit. In 1772, Jefferson represented George Manly, the son of a free woman of color, who sued for freedom after having been held as an indentured servant three years past the expiration of his term. (The Virginia colony at the time bound illegitimate mixed-race children of free women as indentured servants: until age 31 for males, with a shorter term for females.) Once freed, Manly worked for Jefferson at Monticello for wages.|$|E
25|$|According to John Ardoin, however, {{these two}} singers <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> compared. Tebaldi was trained by Carmen Melis, a noted verismo specialist, {{and she was}} rooted in the early 20th century Italian school of singing just as firmly as Callas was rooted in 19th century bel canto. Callas was a {{dramatic}} soprano, whereas Tebaldi considered herself essentially a lyric soprano. Callas and Tebaldi generally sang a different repertoire: {{in the early years}} of her career, Callas concentrated on the heavy dramatic soprano roles and later in her career on the bel canto repertoire, whereas Tebaldi concentrated on late Verdi and verismo roles, where her limited upper extension and her lack of a florid technique were not issues. They shared a few roles, including Tosca in Puccini's opera and La Gioconda, which Tebaldi performed only late in her career.|$|E

500|$|The {{building}} has divided the public over the years, with some branding the building an [...] "eyesore" [...] and a [...] "hideous folly", whereas others {{considered it a}} [...] "classic example of 1960s architecture and an important reminder of Perth's past" [...] and a [...] "unique building". It has been suggested by Associate Ralph Hoare from the Australian Institute of Architects said the building <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> built on St Georges Terrace, having {{been built in the}} [...] "wrong place".|$|E
500|$|He {{served on}} the Yorkshire Cricket Committee, and from 1981, he was Yorkshire President. However, he became {{involved}} in the controversy surrounding Geoffrey Boycott, to whom the committee had decided not to give a new contract. Yardley resigned early in 1984 after a vote of no confidence, dismayed by the attitude of Boycott's supporters. Anthony Woodhouse wrote in his history of Yorkshire: [...] "he conducted affairs in a fair and unbiased manner. Alas, he <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> burdened with the politics of Yorkshire cricket in the 1980s." [...] He died at Lodge Moor, Sheffield on 3 October 1989 following a stroke.|$|E
500|$|Hodgson's release {{has sparked}} {{debate about the}} use of the death penalty, {{particularly}} about its fallibility. Neil Durkin of Amnesty International commented in a piece for The Daily Telegraph: [...] "e had the deeply sad case of Sean Hodgson, the man from Hampshire who ended up being behind bars for 27years, not least because the prosecution service suppressed exculpatory DNA evidence that could have set him free a decade earlier. He was totally innocent, <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> imprisoned {{in the first place and}} on release joins the ranks of those– eventually– rescued from their judicial fate". Durkin characterized the Hodgson case as [...] "a warning not to trust a justice system never to be wrong".|$|E
5000|$|Until {{the end of}} Czechoslovakia in March 1939, {{that state}} was a major target of abuse. Czechoslovakia was {{represented}} as an [...] "abomination" [...] created by the Treaty of Versailles, an artificial state that <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> created. Moreover, Czechoslovakia was frequently accused of engaging {{in some sort of}} genocide against the ethnic Germans of the Sudetenland with German media making recurrent and false claims of massacres of Sudetenlanders. In addition, the Czechoslovak-Soviet treaty of 1935 was represented as an aggressive move aimed at Germany. A particular favourite claim was that Czechoslovakia was a [...] "Soviet air-craft carrier" [...] in Central Europe, namely that were secret Red Air Force bases in Czechoslovakia that would allow the Soviets to bomb and destroy German cities. The high-point of anti-Czechoslovak propaganda was in 1938 with the crisis that ended in the Munich Agreement.|$|R

50|$|In August 1944, Hue helped execute an {{operation}} where the SAS and the resistance took {{over most of}} the villages in Brittany to aid the advance of the Americans. After his work in Brittany, Hue parachuted again, to the town of Nevers in Burgundy, which he again co-ordinated operations between the SOE and the resistance. Hue was awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his work in France. In March 1945, Hue parachuted behind Japanese lines in Burma, where he organised supply drops from the SOE to anti-Japanese guerrillas and led attacks against Japanese forces. When Hue landed in Burma, the Japanese attacked the landing zone, forcing Hue to spend 29 days in the jungle before he was able to join up with the resistance. Hue in a report was very critical of SOE's security in Burma, writing the Japanese <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> allowed to ambush the landing zone.|$|R
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, stating [...] "There {{is not a}} single shot in the movie to fill one with wonder," [...] later naming it one of the worst films of 1997. Jeffery Overstreet of Looking Closer commented [...] "It's time they quit killing the aliens, and just killed the Alien series altogether. ... How the mighty have fallen." [...] Joe Baltake of the Sacramento Bee stated that [...] "This 'Alien' <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> resurrected", while Tom Meek of Film Threat wrote [...] "Weaver and Jeunet's efforts are shortchanged by the ineptness of Joss Whedon's script, that seems {{to find a way to}} make action sequences unexciting." ...|$|E

This would, in time, abolish that part of barbarity and ignorance, for which our natives are so despised by all foreigners: this would bring them to think and act according to the rules of reason, by which a spirit of industry, and thrift, and honesty would be introduced among them. And, indeed, considering how small a tax would suffice for such a work, it is a public scandal that such a thing <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> endeavoured, or, perhaps, so much as thought on.|$|E
500|$|An {{appeals court}} {{overturned}} Sonando's conviction on anti-state charges on 14 March 2013, finding {{that there had}} been no evidence to convict him. The court instead gave Sonando a five-year suspended sentence on charges that he had been involved in the Kratié unrest. A crowd of hundreds of Sonando supporters gathered outside the courthouse to hear the verdict. Amnesty International called the ruling [...] "a positive step for freedom of expression in the country", but added that [...] "Mam Sonando <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> imprisoned in the first place, and the convictions that stand appear baseless." [...] Sonando was released from prison on 15 March, the day after the ruling. Following his release, Sonando stated his intention to clear his name of the remaining charges.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the heated debate in the media, players and administrators refrained from publicly questioning or condemning Meckiff. Neither the England captain May nor manager Freddie Brown raised any concerns about Meckiff's action after the Test. However, it was later revealed that Brown had wanted to lodge an official complaint with the Australian Board of Control, but May had refused, fearing accusations of sour grapes. Years later, Richardson {{and some of his}} fellow batsmen accused the Australian fast bowler of throwing them out, while England paceman Fred Trueman said: [...] "Meckiff's action was totally illegal and that he <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> allowed to play". Richardson's off spinning team-mate Jim Laker likened Meckiff's and Burke's arm actions to those of dart-throwers.|$|E
500|$|Simon Heffer, {{writing in}} the Daily Mail, said that Peel [...] "does not write with {{sufficient}} detachment" [...] or rigorously enough, but that the book will be {{of great interest to}} those who want to know [...] "what is really wrong with the British Establishment"—Heffer {{made it clear that he}} felt Chenevix-Trench <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Headmaster of Eton in the first place, and that other people's appointments in the [...] "British Establishment" [...] were equally flawed. Paul Foot wrote a personal recollection for the Diary section of the London Review of Books, reprinted in the Guardian, in which he described the book as [...] "a wretched hagiography, full of clichés and bad jokes", and objected to its portrayal of Chenevix-Trench as [...] "a heroic figure".|$|E
500|$|People {{living in}} the {{vicinity}} of the illegal factory said that the number of deaths might have been reduced had the fire service responded promptly. They claimed that the fire brigade failed to send personnel or equipment to the scene until more than an hour after the brigade first received word of the fire. Residents also claimed that it was only after the police arrived and requested fire service backup that any help was sent. In addition, some on the scene reported an inadequate number of ambulances. The city's [...] mayor admitted to this lapse the following morning. Local people also complained that the victims <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> taken to the Calcutta National Medical College, but that they should have been transported directly to hospitals with burns units.|$|E
