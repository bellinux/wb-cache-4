5|$|It was {{recognized}} {{early on that}} <b>SiC</b> had such a voltage-dependent resistance, and so columns of <b>SiC</b> pellets were connected between high-voltage power lines and the earth. When a lightning strike to the line raises the line voltage sufficiently, the <b>SiC</b> column will conduct, allowing strike current to pass harmlessly to the earth instead of along the power line. Such <b>SiC</b> columns proved to conduct significantly at normal power-line operating voltages and thus had {{to be placed in}} series with a spark gap. This spark gap is ionized and rendered conductive when lightning raises the voltage of the power line conductor, thus effectively connecting the <b>SiC</b> column between the power conductor and the earth. Spark gaps used in lightning arresters are unreliable, either failing to strike an arc when needed or failing to turn off afterwards, in the latter case due to material failure or contamination by dust or salt. Usage of <b>SiC</b> columns was originally intended to eliminate the need for the spark gap in a lightning arrester. Gapped <b>SiC</b> lightning arresters were used as lightning-protection tool and sold under GE and Westinghouse brand names, among others. The gapped <b>SiC</b> arrester has been largely displaced by no-gap varistors that use columns of zinc oxide pellets.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide is a {{semiconductor}} {{in research}} and early mass production providing advantages for fast, high-temperature and/or high-voltage devices. The first devices available were Schottky diodes, followed by junction-gate FETs and MOSFETs for high-power switching. Bipolar transistors and thyristors are currently developed. A major problem for <b>SiC</b> commercialization has been the elimination of defects: edge dislocations, screw dislocations (both hollow and closed core), triangular defects and basal plane dislocations. As a result, devices made of <b>SiC</b> crystals initially displayed poor reverse blocking performance though researchers have been tentatively finding solutions to improve the breakdown performance. Apart from crystal quality, problems with the interface of <b>SiC</b> with silicon dioxide have hampered the development of SiC-based power MOSFETs and insulated-gate bipolar transistors. Although the mechanism is still unclear, nitridation has dramatically reduced the defects causing the interface problems. In 2008, the first commercial JFETs rated at 1200 V {{were introduced to the}} market, followed in 2011 by the first commercial MOSFETs rated at 1200 V. Beside <b>SiC</b> switches and <b>SiC</b> Schottky diodes (also Schottky barrier diode, SBD) in the popular TO-247 and TO-220 packages, companies started even earlier to implement the bare chips into their power electronic modules. <b>SiC</b> SBD diodes found wide market spread being used in PFC circuits and IGBT power modules.|$|E

A total of 2, 446 proteins was identified by iTRAQ, of which 93 and 29 were significantly differentially expressed in the <b>SICs</b> compared with live control cells (CKL) and dead control cells (CKD), respectively. Among the 93 differentially expressed proteins (DEP) in the <b>SICs</b> compared with CKL, 65 proteins showed down-regulation and 28 showed up-regulation. According to the comprehensive proteome coverage analysis, the <b>SICs</b> survived under HPCD by reducing carbohydrate decomposing, lipid transport and metabolism, amino acid transport and metabolism, transcription and translation, DNA replication and repair. Besides, the <b>SICs</b> showed stress response, DNA damage response and an increased carbohydrate transport, peptidoglycan synthesis and disulfide bond formation to HPCD. Among the 29 DEP in the <b>SICs</b> compared with CKD, 12 proteins showed down-regulation and 17 showed up-regulation. According to the comprehensive proteome coverage analysis, the <b>SICs</b> survived under HPCD by accumulation of cell protective agents like carbohydrates and amino acids, and decreasing transcription and translation activities.

5|$|Silicon carbide (<b>SiC),</b> {{also known}} as {{carborundum}} , is a semiconductor containing silicon and carbon with chemical formula <b>SiC.</b> It occurs in nature as the extremely rare mineral moissanite. Synthetic silicon carbide powder has been mass-produced since 1893 for use as an abrasive. Grains of silicon carbide can be bonded together by sintering to form very hard ceramics that are widely used in applications requiring high endurance, such as car brakes, car clutches and ceramic plates in bulletproof vests. Electronic applications of silicon carbide such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and detectors in early radios were first demonstrated around 1907. <b>SiC</b> is used in semiconductor electronics devices that operate at high temperatures or high voltages, or both. Large single crystals of silicon carbide can be grown by the Lely method; they can be cut into gems known as synthetic moissanite. Silicon carbide with high surface area can be produced from SiO2 contained in plant material.|$|E

40|$|Cellular edema (cell swelling) is a {{principal}} component of numerous brain disorders including ischemia, cortical spreading depression, hyponatremia, and epilepsy. Cellular edema increases seizure-like activity in vitro and in vivo, largely through nonsynaptic mechanisms attributable to reduction of the extracellular space. However, the types of excitability changes occurring in individual neurons during the acute phase of cell volume increase remain unclear. Using whole-cell patch clamp techniques, we report {{that one of the}} first effects of osmotic edema on excitability of CA 1 pyramidal cells is the generation of slow inward currents (<b>SICs),</b> which initiate after approximately 1 min. Frequency of <b>SICs</b> increased as osmolarity decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Imaging of real-time volume changes in astrocytes revealed that neuronal <b>SICs</b> occurred while astrocytes were {{still in the process of}} swelling. <b>SICs</b> evoked by cell swelling were mainly nonsynaptic in origin and NMDA receptor-dependent. To better understand the relationship between <b>SICs</b> and changes in neuronal excitability, recordings were performed in increasingly physiological conditions. In the absence of any added pharmacological reagents or imposed voltage clamp, osmotic edema induced excitatory postsynaptic potentials and burst firing over the same timecourse as <b>SICs.</b> Like <b>SICs,</b> action potentials were blocked by NMDAR antagonists. Effects were more pronounced in adult (8 – 20 weeks old) compared with juvenile (P 15 –P 21) mice. Together, our results indicate that cell swelling triggered by reduced osmolarity rapidly increases neuronal excitability through activation of NMDA receptors. Our findings have important implications for understanding nonsynaptic mechanisms of epilepsy in relation to cell swelling and reduction of the extracellular space...|$|R

40|$|The {{starting}} point for a quantum mechanical investigation of disordered systems usually implies calculations on a limited subset of configurations, generated by defining either the composition of interest or a set of compositions ranging from one end member to another, within an appropriate supercell of the primitive cell of the pure compound. The way in which symmetry {{can be used in}} the identification of symmetry independent configurations (<b>SICs)</b> is discussed here. First, P?lya's enumeration theory is adopted to determine the number of <b>SICs,</b> in the case of both varying and fixed composition, for colors numbering two or higher. Then, De Bruijn's generalization is presented, which allows analysis of the case where the colors are symmetry related, e. g. ?spin up and down in magnetic systems. In spite of their efficiency in counting <b>SICs,</b> neither P?lya's nor De Bruijn's theory helps in solving the difficult problem of identifying the complete list of <b>SICs.</b> Representative <b>SICs</b> are obtained by adopting an orderly generation approach, based on lexicographic ordering, which offers the advantage of avoiding the (computationally expensive) analysis and storage of all the possible configurations. When the number of colors increases, this strategy can be combined with the surjective resolution principle, which permits the efficient generation of <b>SICs</b> of a problem in |R| colors starting from the ones obtained for the (|R|??? 1) -colors case. The whole scheme is documented by means of three examples: the abstract case of a square with C 4 v symmetry and the real cases of the garnet and olivine mineral families...|$|R

40|$|Seizure-induced {{cell death}} is {{believed}} to be regulated by multiple genetic components in addition to numerous external factors. We previously defined quantitative trait loci that control susceptibility to seizure-induced cell death in FVB/NJ (susceptible) and C 57 BL/ 6 J (resistant) mice. Two of these quantitative trait loci assigned to chromosomes 18 (<b>Sicd</b> 1) and 15 (<b>Sicd</b> 2), control seizure-induced cell death resistance. In this study, {{through the use of a}} series of novel congenic strains containing the <b>Sicd</b> 1 and <b>Sicd</b> 2 congenic strains and different combinations of the <b>Sicd</b> 1 or <b>Sicd</b> 2 sub region(s), respectively, we defined these genetic interactions. We generated a double congenic strain, which contains the two C 57 BL/ 6 J differential segments from chromosome 18 and 15, to determine how these two segments interact with one another. Phenotypic comparison between FVB-like littermates and the double congenic FVB. B 6 -Sicd 1 /Sicd 2 strain identified an additive effect with respect to resistance to seizure-induced excitotoxic cell death. It thus appears that C 57 BL/ 6 J alleles located on chromosomes 18 and 15 interact epistatically in an additive manner to control the extent of seizure-induced excitotoxic cell death. Three interval-specific congenic lines were developed, in which either segments of C 57 BL/ 6 J Chr 18 or C 57 BL/ 6 J Chr 15 were introduced in the FVB/NJ genetic background, and progeny were treated with kainate and examined for the extent of seizure-induced cell death. All of the interval-specific congenic lines exhibited reduced cell death in both area CA 3 and the dentate hilus, associated with the C 57 BL/ 6 J phenotype.

40|$|Astrocytes release gliotransmitters, notably glutamate, {{that can}} affect {{neuronal}} and synaptic activity. In particular, astrocytic glutamate release results in the generation of NMDA receptor (NMDA-R) -mediated slow inward currents (<b>SICs)</b> in neurons. However, factors underlying the emergence of <b>SICs</b> and their physiological roles are essentially unknown. Here we show that, in acute slices of rat somatosensory thalamus, stimulation of lemniscal or cortical afferents results in a sustained increase of <b>SICs</b> in thalamocortical (TC) neurons that outlasts {{the duration of the}} stimulus by 1 h. This long-term enhancement of astrocytic glutamate release is induced by group I metabotropic glutamate receptors and is dependent on astrocytic intracellular calcium.
