However to apply this technique, the process parameters must be optimized to obtain improved mechanical properties compared to resistance spot welding. To achieve this, in this investigation, design of experiments was used to conduct the experiments for exploring the interdependence of the process parameters. A second order quadratic model for predicting the lap <b>shear</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of friction stir spot welded low carbon automotive steel joints was developed from the experimental obtained data. It is found that dwell time {{plays a major role}} in deciding the joint properties, which is followed by rotational speed and plunge depth.

The lap <b>shear</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of the Cu/Al joints decreased when {{the thickness of the}} intermetallic layer was greater than 1 μm at various amplitudes. With the increase in welding time, a crack occurred in the copper side owing to the occurrence of the eutectic reaction, α-A l + θ → L, at the periphery of the nugget.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{highlights the}} effect of surface modification on polyimide by atmospheric pressure plasma treatment with different exposure time. Surface modification of polymer by plasma treatment essentially creates physical and chemical changes such as cross-linking and formation of free radicals. It also forms oxygen functionalization {{in the form of}} polar groups on polymer surface, hence improving the wetting and adhesion properties. It is observed that surface energy of the polymer increases with increasing exposure time of atmospheric pressure plasma. However, prolonged exposure time of plasma results in deterioration of the surface layer of polyimide resulting in degradation and embrittlement. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy analysis reveal that there is a considerable morphological change on the polymer surface due to atmospheric pressure plasma treatment. X-ray photo electron spectroscopy analysis reveals that the oxygen functionalities of polymer surface increases significantly when polyimide is exposed to atmospheric pressure plasma. Untreated and atmospheric pressure plasma-treated polyimide sheet are adhesive bonded by employing polyimide adhesive as well as with titanium substrate. Due to surface modification of polyimide, it is observed that there is a significant increase in lap <b>shear</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> and therefore, this technology is highly acceptable for aviation and space applications.

40|$|Human and Systems EngineeringLaser welding is an {{emerging}} joining technique for automotive industry. Due {{to the complex}} process, the control of laser welding quality problem such as spatter, porosity, and undercut is not easy. Traditional mechanical testing of weld is time consuming, costly, and inefficient for on-line monitoring of laser welding quality. In this regards, this thesis aims to estimate the laser welding quality in a non-destructive way by using the geometry of top weld seam of weldment. The most challenging task which is covered in this thesis is the estimation of the <b>tensile</b> <b>shear</b> <b>strength</b> in a non-destructive way. Experimental analysis reveals {{that the existence of}} two types of correlation in the variation of weld seam and <b>tensile</b> <b>shear</b> <b>strength</b> in the laser welding of galvanized steel: (1) positive correlation exists between the log-transformed average width of the top weld seam and maximum <b>tensile</b> <b>shear</b> <b>strength,</b> and (2) negative correlation exists between the variation of the width of top weld seam and maximum <b>tensile</b> <b>shear</b> <b>strength.</b> These correlations exist only when top weld seam having non uniform seam boundary. However, weld seam having uniform seam boundary do not have sufficient evidence of the correlation between the variation of weld seam and <b>tensile</b> <b>shear</b> <b>strength.</b> The reason for {{this is due to the}} high value of standard deviation of the average width of the top weld seam.

40|$|Engineering & Systems DesignThe use {{of laser}} welding has become quite {{widespread}} {{because it can}} achieve higher productivity than spot welding. This is due to its desirable features, which include high power density, faster welding speed, highly accurate welding, and excellent repeatability. In addition, laser welding can minimize the distortion in heat-affected zones (HAZs), {{and there is no}} tooling that wears out or must be changed over. In spite of these advantages, laser welding still causes many problems when used on compositions such as galvanized steel and aluminum alloy. Galvanized steel, for example, is composed of a zinc layer whose physical parameters differ from those of steel as a base material. Zinc vaporizes at a temperature of 907 K, whereas steel begins to melt at 1510 K. This phenomenon causes serious defects in welds because the pressure of zinc is more powerful than that of steel. As a result, a certain manipulable control is needed in order for the zinc coating to be able to evaporate. To prevent this circumstance, the following solutions have been proposed: (i) a de-gassing method that induces the zinc fumes to escape from the part-to-part gap between two materials; (ii) the removal of zinc layers that will be joined together; (iii) a pulsed laser method that minimizes zinc vaporization using a high energy per pulse and a short pulse duration; (iv) a laser hybrid method; and (v) the addition of additional elements to the surface, which form a compound with the vaporizing zinc. Despite these suggestions, applications involving zinc-coated steels are rarely used in the automotive industry because the shapes of the materials to be welded are not always uniform. 	In this study, we ascertain the effects of the part-to-part gap and the direction of welding on the quality of laser welding. Using a 2 kW fiber laser and galvanized steel sheets (with thicknesses of 1. 4 mm and 1. 8 mm), our experiments employed lap welding, which has been applied to side members in the automotive industry. The experimental design was used with a 33 factorial design with 3 replications. The three types of welding direction used are ascendance, descendance, and a uniform gap. Based on the experiments, using analysis of variance (ANOVA) it was determined that the direction of welding is an important factor that can affect the weld quality. In addition, the differences between the shear tensile strengths in the ascendance and descendance directions were determined using a t-Test. The maximum <b>shear</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> in the ascendance direction was achieved with a laser power of 2000 W and a welding speed of 2100 mm/min, followed by a part-to-part gap of 0. 32 mm/min as the steepest ascent method. Moreover, we analyzed cross-sections of sampling specimens, varying the gap differences in order to verify the differences in <b>shear</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> based on two different directions of welding. ope...|$|E

It is generally accepted in geotechnical engineering that non-cohesive materials such as sands exhibit no or negligible <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> However, there is significant evidence that interparticle forces arising from capillary and other pore-scale force mechanisms increase both the <b>shear</b> and <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of soils. The general behavior of these pore-scale forces, their role in macroscopic stress, strength, and deformation behavior, and the changes that occur in the field under natural or imposed changes in water content remain largely uncertain. The primary objective of this research was to experimentally examine the manifestation of capillary-induced interparticle forces in partially saturated sands to macroscopic <b>shear</b> <b>strength,</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> and deformation behavior. This was accomplished by conducting a large suite of direct shear and direct tension tests using three gradations of Ottawa sand prepared to relatively "loose" and relatively "dense" conditions over a range of degrees saturation. Results were compared with previous experimental results from similar tests, existing theoretical formulations to define effective stress in unsaturated soil, and a hypothesis proposed to define a direct relationship between <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and effective stress. The major conclusions obtained from this research include: Theoretical models tended to underpredict measured <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> Analysis of results indicates that shear strength may be reasonably predicted using the sum of <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and total normal stress as an equivalent effective stress [sigma prime equals alpha tau plus alpha nu]. Analysis also indicates that Bishop's (1959) effective stress formulation is a reasonable representation for effective stress by setting x equals S and by backcalculating x from <b>shear</b> tests. <b>Tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and apparent cohesion measured exhibited doublepeak behavior as a function of degree of saturation.

A study {{has been carried out}} to characterize the effectiveness of the process of welding 1 mm thick Al sheet to 0. 25 mm thick SS sheet. The results of the microstructure and <b>tensile</b> <b>shear</b> <b>strength</b> tests are also reported. (C) 200...|$|R
