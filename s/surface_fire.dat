40|$|AbstractThe basic {{characteristics}} of full <b>surface</b> <b>fires</b> of large scale floating roof tanks are briefed. It is {{pointed out that}} the present fire fighting systems of large scale crude oil storage depots cannot meet the need to extinguish full <b>surface</b> <b>fires</b> of large scale floating roof tanks. Adequate data of successful extinguishment of large scale tanks full <b>surface</b> <b>fires</b> and full scale tank fire experiments in the world are badly needed to design fire fighting system to extinguish full <b>surface</b> <b>fires</b> of large scale tanks in large scale crude oil storage depots. According to “Code of design for low expansion foam extinguishing system” and relative study results abroad, the fire fighting systems are calculated and designed to deal with full <b>surface</b> <b>fires</b> of large scale floating roof tanks. It is shown that designing parameters provided by API are more credible and large foam monitors act as the main fire extinguish facilities. The fire water supplying system is designed according to “Fire prevention code of petrochemical enterprise design”. The results show that the capability of the present fire fighting system should be raised up to at least 6 - 10 times to meet the need to extinguish full <b>surface</b> <b>fires</b> of large scale floating roof tanks. The reconstructing programs of fire fighting system are provided to deal with full <b>surface</b> <b>fires</b> of large scale floating roof tanks in the end...|$|R

25|$|A {{controversial}} {{point of}} the DD(X) destroyer(s) is their planned naval <b>surface</b> <b>fire</b> support (NSFS) role. The original DD21 and the Arsenal Ship had more serious NSFS capabilities, which would meet a Congress-mandated requirement related to the s. The requirement was eventually relaxed, the battleships stricken from the registry, and the navy left with small tonnage ships for NSFS or alternative methods such as air support. The official position of the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Navy is that the Zumwalt-class destroyer(s) will be adequate as naval surface gunfire support ships, although there are dissenters.|$|E
25|$|Thousands of coal {{fires are}} burning around the world. Those burning {{underground}} {{can be difficult}} to locate and many cannot be extinguished. Fires can cause the ground above to subside, their combustion gases are dangerous to life, and breaking out to the surface can initiate surface wildfires. Coal seams can be set on fire by spontaneous combustion or contact with a mine fire or <b>surface</b> <b>fire.</b> Lightning strikes are an important source of ignition. The coal continues to burn slowly back into the seam until oxygen (air) can no longer reach the flame front. A grass fire in a coal area can set dozens of coal seams on fire. Coal fires in China burn an estimated 120 million tons of coal a year, emitting 360 million metric tons of CO2, amounting to 2–3% of the annual worldwide production of CO2 from fossil fuels. In Centralia, Pennsylvania (a borough located in the Coal Region of the United States), an exposed vein of anthracite ignited in 1962 due to a trash fire in the borough landfill, located in an abandoned anthracite strip mine pit. Attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful, and it continues to burn underground to this day. The Australian Burning Mountain was originally believed to be a volcano, but the smoke and ash come from a coal fire that has been burning for some 6,000 years.|$|E
25|$|The Legend-class cutters are {{the second}} longest of all U.S. Coast Guard cutters, behind the {{research}} icebreaker , and {{will replace the}} twelve s in service. These cutters are envisioned by the Coast Guard as being able to undertake {{the entire range of}} the high endurance cutter roles with additional upgrades to make it more of an asset to the Department of Defense during declared national emergency contingencies. These vessels can be used for intercepting suspect vessels, or for rescuing swimmers, fishery protection, maritime homeland security missions, counterterrorism, coastal patrol missions, defense operations and other military/naval operations, and can assist in mine warfare. To facilitate intercept missions, the Legend class can carry and launch both the Short Range Prosecutor and the Long Range Interceptor rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIBs). The cutters are configured to be able to survive in Low Threat Environments, which can include the enemy having a poorly equipped military, some coastal patrol craft, and few to none anti-ship cruise missiles, operations in this environment could be general defense operations including theater security, port protection, ship escort, anti-piracy, and maritime interception operations, and the cutters can also survive in Medium Threat Environments, which can include fairly well equipped military, with ships and aircraft with weapons and radar coverage well offshore, higher numbers of anti-ship cruise missiles and a possible submarine threat, operations in this threat environment could include defense operations, naval <b>surface</b> <b>fire</b> support, and the evacuation of non-combatants. The cutters are not expected to survive in a high threat environment for a decent amount of time with their current configuration.|$|E

500|$|Vanguard {{was unique}} among British battleships in having remote power control (RPC) for her main, {{secondary}} and tertiary guns {{along with the}} Admiralty Fire Control Table Mk X for <b>surface</b> <b>fire</b> control of the main armament. There were two director control towers (DCT) for the 15-inch guns, each carrying a [...] "double cheese" [...] Type 274 fire-control radar for range finding and spotting the fall of shot. Each DCT could control all four turrets while 'B' turret could control 'A' and 'X' turrets. 'X' turret could only control 'Y' turret. There were four American Mark 37 DCTs for the 5.25-inch guns, each carrying the twin domes of Type 275 gunnery radar. Lastly, each Mark VI sextuple 40mm Bofors mounting was provided with a separate CRBF ("close range blind fire") director fitted with a Type 262 radar, although the ship never mounted her complete outfit of those directors. The STAAG Mk II 40mm Bofors mounting carried its own Type 262 on the mounting itself. Other radar sets carried were Type 960 air and surface search, Type 293 target indication and Type 277 height finding.|$|E

50|$|Wildfires {{during the}} Paleozoic and Mesozoic periods {{followed}} patterns similar to fires {{that occur in}} modern times. <b>Surface</b> <b>fires</b> driven by dry seasons are evident in Devonian and Carboniferous progymnosperm forests. Lepidodendron forests dating to the Carboniferous period have charred peaks, evidence of crown fires. In Jurassic gymnosperm forests, {{there is evidence of}} high frequency, light <b>surface</b> <b>fires.</b> The increase of fire activity in the late Tertiary is possibly due to the increase of C4-type grasses. As these grasses shifted to more mesic habitats, their high flammability increased fire frequency, promoting grasslands over woodlands. However, fire-prone habitats {{may have contributed to the}} prominence of trees such as those of the genera Eucalyptus, Pinus and Sequoia, which have thick bark to withstand fires and employ serotiny.|$|R
2500|$|On 5 February 2009, Destroyer Squadron Nine (DESRON-9) {{completed}} its Naval <b>Surface</b> <b>Fire</b> Support re-certification {{off the coast}} of San Clemente Island, California.

40|$|Relationships {{between the}} {{flammability}} properties {{of a given}} plant and its chances of survival after a fire still remain unknown. We hypothesize that the bark flammability of a tree reduces the potential for tree survival following <b>surface</b> <b>fires,</b> and that if tree resistance to fire is provided by a thick insulating bark, the latter must be few flammable. We tests, on subalpine tree species, {{the relationship between the}} flammability of bark and its insulating ability, identifies the biological traits that determine bark flammability, and assesses their relative susceptibility to <b>surface</b> <b>fires</b> from their bark properties. The experimental set of burning properties was analyzed by Principal Component Analysis to assess the bark flammability. Bark insulating ability was expressed by the critical time to cambium kill computed from bark thickness. Log-linear regressions indicated that bark flammability varies with the bark thickness and the density of wood under bark and that the most flammable barks have poor insulating ability. Susceptibility to <b>surface</b> <b>fires</b> increases from gymnosperm to angiosperm subalpine trees. The co-dominant subalpine species Larix decidua (Mill.) and Pinus cembra (L.) exhibit large differences in both flammability and insulating ability of the bark that should partly explain their contrasted responses to fires in the past...|$|R
40|$|In {{wildland}} fires {{where water}} {{is used as}} the primary extinguishing agent, {{one of the issues}} of wildfire suppression is estimating how much water is required to extinguish a certain section of the fire. In order to use easily distinguished and available indicators, the flame length and the area of the active combustion zone were chosen as suitable for the modelling of extinguishing requirements. Using Byram's and Thomas' equations, the heat release rate per unit length of fire front was calculated for low-intensity <b>surface</b> <b>fires,</b> fires with higher wind conditions, fires in steep terrain and high-intensity crown fires. Based on the heat release rate per unit length of fire front, the critical water flow rate was calculated for the various cases. Further, the required amount of water for a specific active combustion zone area was calculated for various fuel models. Finally, the results for low-intensity <b>surface</b> <b>fires</b> were validated against fire experiments. The calculated volumes of water can be used both during the preparatory planning for incidents as well as during firefighting operations...|$|R

2500|$|Two days later, Healy and {{the other}} ships steamed out to join Admiral Mitscher's carrier task force as the Japanese made {{preparations}} to close the Marianas for a decisive naval battle. The great fleets approached each other on 19 June for the biggest carrier engagement of the war: the Battle of the Philippine Sea. As four large air raids hit the American dispositions, fighter cover from the ships of Healys task group and <b>surface</b> <b>fire</b> from the ships decimated the Japanese formations. With able assistance from American submarines, Mitscher succeeded in sinking two Japanese carriers in addition to inflicting fatal losses on the enemy naval air arm during [...] "The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot" [...] on 19 June.

As a result, the DD(X) is now expected to displace more than 14,000 tons and by the navy's estimate, cost almost $3.3 billion each. Originally, the navy proposed building 32 next-generation destroyers, reduced that to 24, then to 7, and finally to 3, {{in order to make the}} program affordable.

2500|$|The QF 5.25 inch Mark I {{dual purpose}} gun has been dogged with {{controversy}} as well. The RN Gunnery Pocket Book published in 1945 states that: [...] "The maximum {{rate of fire}} should be 10–12 rounds per minute.". Wartime experience revealed that the maximum weight which the loading numbers could handle comfortably was much lower than 80–90lb, {{and the weight of}} the 5.25-inch ammunition caused serious difficulties, allowing them to manage only 7–8 rpm instead of the designed 10–12 rpm. The mount had a maximum elevation of +70 degrees. The slow elevating and training speeds of the mounts were inadequate for engaging modern high-speed aircraft. Despite these issues, Prince of Wales was credited with several 5.25-inch kills during Operation Halberd, and damaged 10 of 16 high level bombers in two formations during her last engagement, two of which subsequently crash landed. [...] had her 5.25-inch turrets upgraded to RP10 control which increased training and elevating speeds to 20 degrees per second. These ships were equipped with the HACS AA fire control system and the Admiralty Fire Control clock for <b>surface</b> <b>fire</b> control of the secondary armament.|$|E
40|$|Wildfires are {{a common}} {{disturbance}} agent in the global boreal forests. In the North American boreal forests, they {{have been shown to}} exert a strong cooling effect through post-fire changes in surface albedo that has a larger overall impact on the climate system than associated carbon emissions. However, these findings are not directly applicable to the Siberian larch forests, a major component of the boreal biome where species composition are dominated by a deciduous needleleaf species and fire regimes are characterized by the common occurrence of both stand-replacing and less-severe <b>surface</b> <b>fires.</b> This dissertation quantifies the post-fire surface forcing imposed by both fire types in these forests over 14 years since fire, and determines that both surface and stand replacing fires impose cooling effects through increased albedo during snow season. The magnitude of the cooling effect from stand replacing fires is much larger than that of <b>surface</b> <b>fires,</b> and this is likely a consequence of higher levels of canopy damage after stand-replacing fires. At its peak (~ year 11 after fire occurrence), the cooling magnitude {{is similar to that of}} the North American boreal fires. Strong cooling effect and the wide-spread occurrence of stand-replacing fires lead to a net negative surface forcing over the entire region between 2002 and 2013. Based on the extended albedo trajectory which was made possible by developing a 24 -year stand age map, it was shown that the cooling effect of stand-replacing fires lasts for more than 26 years. The overall cooling effect of <b>surface</b> <b>fires</b> is of lower magnitude and is likely indicative of damages not only to the canopies but also the shrubs in the understory. Based on the identified difference in their influences on post-fire energy budget, this dissertation also identified a remote sensing method to separate <b>surface</b> <b>fires</b> from stand-replacing fires in Siberian larch forests with an 88 % accuracy. The insights gained from this dissertation will allow for accurate representation of wildfires in the regional or global climate models in the future...|$|R

30|$|The patch size {{found in}} our study {{overlaps}} with that found by one other study that examined spatial autocorrelation in fire temperature during low-intensity <b>surface</b> <b>fires.</b> Franklin et al.

These comparisons {{lend support to the}} idea that low-intensity <b>surface</b> <b>fires</b> in longleaf pine are patchy over medium scales, as opposed to the finer scales that may be typical of high intensity fires. Therefore, while the fires examined in our study did not have a narrowly definable patch size, it may be possible that the patch size of fires can be predicted based on fuel type and stand characteristics over more broadly defined scales (< 10 m, 10 – 200 m, > 200 m). More comparative studies that report spatial autocorrelation are needed to examine this.|$|R
