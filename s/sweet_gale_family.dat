40|$|Abstract: To {{investigate}} whether the fertilizers N, P or K individually affect plant growth, oil {{content and the}} gender of <b>sweet</b> <b>gale,</b> two trials, pot and field trials, were carried out at Orkney College UHI in Scotland. A pot trial was established with eight soils which were collected from different <b>sweet</b> <b>gale</b> trial sites {{in the north of}} Scotland. Although neither shoot yield nor oil concentration in shoots was affected by soil, there were significant differences in shoot yields as a result of fertilizer treatments (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) or none (control)). The best yield was obtained from the N treatment which was double to that of the control and P treatments. N, P or K fertilizers did not consistently affect shoot oil concentration in two seasons; however, oil yield was significantly affected, and N treatment produced two-three fold oil yield increases compared with the control or P treatment. In the N treatment, the increase in shoot yield was positively correlated with total nitrogen or nitrate nitrogen in the soil, suggesting the occurrence of a nitrogen priming effect. Data suggested that as shoot yield increased the oil concentration in shoots decreased. Neither soil nor N, P or K fertilizers had a significant effect on oil composition. Amongst fertilizer treatments, P resulted in the largest number of plants changing gender from female to male. A field N trial confirmed that nitrogen significantly enhanced the shoot yield of young plants...|$|R

The staminate catkins range from 6 to 10 mm long, are crowded on the branchlet, with the individual flowers overtopped by the broad, shining, subtending, brown bracts. The pistillate catkins range from 7 to 10 mm long, each flower subtended by two wing-like bracts that remain fused to the fruit.

It {{is also known as}} bog myrtle, Dutch myrtle English myrtle, and meadow fern, although this species is neither a true fern nor myrtle. <b>Sweet</b> <b>gale</b> is an aromatic, deciduous, shrub up to 2. 5 m tall. The plant is single or multistemmed, with strongly ascending branches. The twigs are terete, brown with scattered yellow glands. The leaves are 2 to 6 cm long (including the short petiole), oblanceolate (i. e., widest toward apex) with cuneate bases, toothed only toward the apex, glabrous and shining above but usually pubescent on the blade’s underside. Like the twigs, the blades on both sides are often beset with yellow glands. The flowers are in unisexual, unbranched catkins (aments), with the staminate (male) and pistillate (female) catkins appearing on different plants. Individual plants have been known to change sex from year to year Range. —Sweet gale is found in the New and Old World temperate regions. It occurs in th...|$|R

Originally this kind of brew was made in all Nordic countries, but the tradition of its brewing has only survived into modern times on the island of Gotland. When hops were introduced in Scandinavia during the 13th century, these were used to replace drikkes juniper boughs as flavoring. However, Gotland retained the tradition of using juniper although some hops were added to recipes, as it was a better preservative and added more flavor. The main flavoring was still juniper boughs and <b>sweet</b> <b>gale.</b> During the 20th century, sugar became a substitute for honey as the sweetener in drikke, but it is still brewed with honey, or without any additional sweetener at all, in parts of the island.
