According to {{requirements}} of online steel ball <b>surface</b> <b>defect</b> inspection, the automatic detection method of spherical <b>surface</b> <b>defect</b> {{on the track}} has been posed. To ensure photographing of the whole steel ball surface, the six CCD video cameras are used in this system. To overcome steel ball surface reflection, the red LED light source is used, and then the real and clear images are got. The steel ball <b>surface</b> <b>defect</b> is recognized accurately by means of image recognition technology and image reconstruction technology etc. This method provides theoretical basis and technical support for ball defection and quality classification...|$|R

In foams, they {{are used to}} emulsify the liquid components, regulate cell size, and stabilize the cell structure to prevent collapse and sub-surface voids. In non-foam applications they are used as air release and antifoaming agents, as wetting agents, and are used to eliminate <b>surface</b> <b>defects</b> such as pin holes, orange peel, and sink marks.|$|E

This process only recycles the top two inches (50mm) or less, {{so it can be}} used to correct rutting, polishing or other <b>surface</b> <b>defects.</b> It is not a good procedure for roads with structural failures.

Inclusions may be crystals of a foreign material or another diamond crystal, or structural imperfections such as tiny cracks that can appear whitish or cloudy. The number, size, color, relative location, orientation, and visibility of inclusions can all affect the relative clarity of a diamond. A clarity grade is assigned based on the overall appearance of the stone under ten times magnification.|$|E

Here we report the role of different size <b>surface</b> <b>defect</b> rich ZnO quantum dots (D-QDs) for inhibiting metabolic enzymes and scavenging free radicals, which {{plays a key role}} in reducing hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress. Quantitative analysis of radical scavenging and metabolic enzyme inhibition activity of D-QDs demonstrates a size dependent behaviour, where D-QDs with a smaller diameter shows superior activity compared to larger size D-QDs. Considering the size dependence in <b>surface</b> <b>defect</b> formation, the increased <b>surface</b> <b>defect</b> density in smaller size D-QDs can be considered as the reason behind this enhancement.

500|$|Water-based lubricants, called emulsions, are {{the most}} [...] used type of lubricant, because of health, environmental, and safety reasons. Unlike {{solvent-based}} lubricants, if water is properly treated to remove all minerals from it, it will not leave any by-product in the dies. If the water is not properly treated, then the minerals can cause <b>surface</b> <b>defects</b> and discontinuities. There are four types of water-based lubricants: oil in water, water in oil, semi-synthetic, and synthetic. Oil in water is the best, because when the lubricant is applied, the water cools the die surface by evaporating while depositing the oil, which helps release the shot. A common mixture {{for this type of}} lubricants is thirty parts water to one part oil, however in extreme cases a ratio of 100:1 is used.|$|E

[...] However, as the crystal rotates away from the diffraction angle, the elastic (main) peak drops in intensity. [...] The intensity never shrinks to zero even far from diffraction conditions, however, due to incoherent elastic scattering from <b>surface</b> <b>defects.</b> [...] The intensity of the incoherent elastic peak and its dependence on scattering angle can therefore provide useful information about surface imperfections present on the crystal.|$|E

[...] It takes advantage of standard metal deposition, photolithography, and etching to create alignment marks commonly on glass or other device substrates. [...] Thin polymer adhesive layers are applied to enhance resistance to particles and <b>surface</b> <b>defects.</b> [...] Microscale ICs are transfer-printed onto the adhesive surface and then baked to fully cure adhesive layers. [...] An additional photosensitive polymer layer {{is applied to the}} substrate to account for the topography caused by the printed ICs, reintroducing a flat surface.

[...] OLED layers are applied to the anode layer with conventional vapor deposition, and covered with a conductive metal electrode layer. [...] transfer-printing was capable to print onto target substrates up to 500mm X 400mm.

The log is laid horizontally and rotated about its long axis while a long blade is pressed into it, causing {{a thin layer of}} wood to peel off (much as a continuous sheet of paper from a roll). An adjustable nosebar, which may be solid or a roller, is pressed against the log during rotation, to create a [...] "gap" [...] for veneer to pass through between the knife and the nosebar. [...] The nosebar partly compresses the wood as it is peeled; it controls vibration of the peeling knife; and assists in keeping the veneer being peeled to an accurate thickness. [...] In this way the log is peeled into sheets of veneer, which are then cut to the desired oversize dimensions, to allow it to shrink (depending on wood species) when dried. [...] The sheets are then patched, graded, glued together and then baked in a press at a temperature of at least , and at a pressure of up to [...] (but more commonly 200 psi) to form the plywood panel.
