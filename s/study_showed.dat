5|$|A <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> {{that high}} levels of {{nutrients}} used in farming and ranching activities fuel parasite infections that have caused frog deformities in ponds and lakes across North America. The <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> increased levels of nitrogen and phosphorus cause sharp hikes in the abundance of trematodes, and that the parasites subsequently form cysts in the developing limbs of tadpoles causing missing limbs, extra limbs and other severe malformations including five or six extra or even no limbs.|$|E
5|$|Growling: Often {{accompanied}} by hissing and spitting, the cheetah growls {{to show its}} annoyance, or when faced with danger. A <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that growls consist of numerous short pulses with a combined duration of up to five seconds.|$|E
5|$|The sponge {{benefits}} {{from the fact that}} living on the scallop prevents it from being buried in sediment. In the wild it has been found that the scallops and their encrusting sponges both grow to a larger size in areas of high turbidity. A laboratory <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that, in conditions where the sediment was frequently stirred up, sponges on empty scallop shells all died while those on living shells flourished. However, another <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that growth rates in scallops heavily encrusted by sponges were significantly lower than in unencumbered ones.|$|E

This study used the gastrointestinal contents of rainbow trout to scan for bacteria that inhibited growth of S.iniae and Lactococcus garvieae. They identified Aeromonas sobria as a potential candidate for control of S.iniae and L.garvieae infections in aquaculture. A.sobria, given live in the feed, protected the trout when challenged with S.iniae or L.garvieae.|$|E
5|$|A 2007 <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that 16% of Armenians born in Lebanon, 29% in Armenia (including Soviet Armenia), 31% in Iran and 36% in Turkey are not {{proficient}} in English. Many foreign-born Armenians are multilingual, speaking {{at least one}} language other than Armenian and English. For instance, Armenians from Armenia might know Russian, those from Lebanon and Syria may know Arabic and French, almost all Iranian Armenians speak Persian and Istanbul Armenians speak Turkish.|$|E

The Brain Drain <b>Study</b> <b>shows</b> nearly 9 out of 10 Millennials place an importance on work-life balance, with additional surveys demonstrating the generation to favor familial over corporate values. <b>Studies</b> also <b>show</b> a preference for work-life balance, which contrasts to the Baby Boomers' work-centric attitude.|$|R
5|$|Across {{most of its}} European range, {{the most}} {{important}} predator of the Eurasian nuthatch is the sparrowhawk. Other species known to prey on this nuthatch include the northern goshawk, hobby, tawny owl, pygmy owl and least weasel. A Swedish <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that 6.2% of the nuthatch nests in their study area were raided by predators. The perpetrators were not identified, but the main single predator of tit nests in the same study was the great spotted woodpecker.|$|E
5|$|Another $500,000 {{study was}} ordered in 2003 by the legislature, {{creating}} a new commerce corridor to link Lewis County {{in the south to}} the Canada–US border in the north. However the <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that a highway existing north of I-90 was not economically feasible. The study proposed a toll road only for trucks, since the presence of passenger cars would discourage truck drivers from using the new alternate route. The highway was estimated to cost between $13.5 and $19 billion.|$|E
5|$|At {{least some}} wild {{bottlenose}} dolphins use tools. In Shark Bay, dolphins place a marine sponge on their rostrum, presumably {{to protect it}} when searching for food on the sandy sea bottom. This has only been observed in this bay (first in 1997), and is predominantly practiced by females. Sea otters are the only other known marine mammalian tool users. A 2005 <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> mothers most likely teach the behavior to their offspring, evincing culture (behavior learned from other species members).|$|E

5|$|Broods {{that fail}} {{tend to do}} so during incubation. One English <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that only 14.5% of eggs survived to hatching, but once that stage was reached the chances of {{fledging}} successfully were high. European nightjars breed when aged one year, and typically live for four years. The adult annual survival rate is 70%, but that for juveniles is unknown. The maximum known age in the wild is just over 12years.|$|E
5|$|Churring: The {{purpose of}} this sound {{is similar to that}} of the chirp. It may {{resemble}} a growl. Zoologist Jonathan Kingdon considered the chirp of the cheetah as similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. The churr, is staccato and has a shorter range than the chirp. A <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that churrs comprise 3to 15 separate pulses and last 0.1to 1.3 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Crop {{rotation}} is, {{however, the}} most important cultural control of L. decemlineata. Rotation may delay the infestation of potatoes and can reduce the build-up of early season beetle populations because the adults emerging from diapause can only disperse to new food sources by walking. One 1984 <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that rotating potatoes with non-host plants reduced the density of early season adults by 95.8%.|$|E

5|$|During the 1990s, bulkers were {{involved}} in an alarming number of shipwrecks. This led ship-owners to commission a study seeking to explain the effect of various factors on the crew's effectiveness and competence. The <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that crew performance aboard bulk carriers was the lowest of all groups studied. Among bulker crews, the best performance was found aboard younger and larger ships. Crews on better-maintained ships performed better, as did crews on ships where fewer languages were spoken.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, the caracal was {{classified}} under the genera Felis or Lynx. However, a 2006 phylogenetic <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that the caracal evolved {{nearly a million}} years before the lynx appeared. The caracal is most {{closely related to the}} African golden cat (Profelis aurata, often considered a species of Caracal). These two species, together with the serval (Leptailurus serval), form one of the eight lineages of Felidae. The Caracal lineage came into existence 8.5 mya, and the ancestor of this lineage arrived in Africa 8.5–5.6 mya.|$|E

A 1986 ConnDOT study analyzed congestion on Interstate 95, which runs parallel to the line. The <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that Old Saybrook was a better terminus for initial service, with an expected ridership of 420 riders in each direction daily.|$|E
5|$|Leucopaxillus giganteus {{contains}} a bioactive compound named clitocine that has antibiotic activity against {{a number of}} bacteria that are pathogenic to humans, such as Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis; an earlier (1945) <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> antibiotic activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella typhi, and Brucea abortus. Clitocine {{has also been shown}} to promote apoptosis (cell death) in human cervical cancer cells in vitro (HeLa). The mycelia of L.giganteus, when grown in liquid culture, has been shown to produce phenols and flavonoids that have antioxidant activity.|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} in 2003 suggests that extracts from Polyozellus multiplex may have suppressive effects on stomach cancer. The <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that feeding a low concentration (0.5% or 1%) of the mushroom extract enhanced {{the activities of}} the enzymes glutathione S-transferase and superoxide dismutase, and increased the abundance of the molecule glutathione. The extract also augmented the expression of the protein p53. All of these substances protect the human organism against cancer. Additional studies reported in 2004 and 2006 attribute anti-tumor properties to polyozellin.|$|E
