40|$|We analyze two {{theoretical}} {{approaches to}} ensemble averaging for integrable systems in quantum chaos - <b>spectral</b> <b>averaging</b> and parametric averaging. For <b>spectral</b> <b>averaging,</b> we {{introduce a new}} procedure - rescaled <b>spectral</b> <b>averaging.</b> Unlike traditional <b>spectral</b> <b>averaging,</b> it can describe the correlation function of spectral staircase and produce persistent oscillations of the interval level number variance. Parametric averaging, while not as accurate as rescaled <b>spectral</b> <b>averaging</b> for the correlation function of spectral staircase and interval level number variance, can also produce persistent oscillations of the global level number variance and better describes saturation level rigidity {{as a function of}} the running energy. Overall, it is the most reliable method for a wide range of statistics. Comment: 7 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper explores a {{geometric}} {{framework for}} modeling non-stationary but slowly varying time series, {{based on the}} assumption that short-windowed power spectra capture their spectral character, and that energy transference in the frequency domain has a physical significance. The framework relies on certain notions of transportation distance and their respective geodesics to model possible non-parametric changes in the power spectral density with respect to time. We discuss the relevance of this framework to applications in spectral tracking, <b>spectral</b> <b>averaging,</b> and speech morphing.

Our analysis {{is based on the}} Weyl-Wigner formalism for the <b>spectral</b> <b>average</b> C_ϵ(q^+, q^-,E) of ψ_n(q^+) ψ_n^*(q^-), defined as the average over eigenstates within an energy window ϵ centered at E. In this framework C_ϵ is the Fourier transform in momentum space of the spectral Wigner function W(x,E;ϵ). Our study reveals the chord structure that C_ϵ inherits from the spectral Wigner function showing the interplay between the size of the <b>spectral</b> <b>average</b> window, and the spatial separation scale. We discuss under which conditions is it possible to define a local system independent regime for C_ϵ. In doing so, we derive an expression that bridges the existing formulae in the literature and find expressions for C_ϵ(q^+, q^-,E) valid for any separation size | q^+- q^-|.

40|$|Abstract. A <b>spectral</b> <b>average</b> which generalises {{the local}} spacing {{distribution}} of the eigenvalues of random N × N hermitian matrices in {{the bulk of their}} spectrum as N → ∞ is known to be a τ-function of the fifth Painlevé system. This τ-function, τ(s), has generic parameters and is transcendental but is characterised by particular boundary conditions about the singular point s = 0, which we determine here. When the average reduces to the local spacing distribution we find that τ-function is of the separatrix, or partially truncated type. 1. Motivations Recent studies [13, 14, 15] have revealed that a generalised <b>spectral</b> <b>average</b> for the universality classes of scaled random hermitian matrix ensembles- the bulk, hard edge and soft edge classes for β = 2 - are determined by general transcendental solutions of the Painlevé equations PV, PIII and PII respectively. These works unified earlier studies [19],[23],[24],[25] in the sense that this average includes local eigenvalue spacing distributions and moments of the characteristic polynomials as special cases, and extended them in that the parameter sets of the Painlevé equations were exhausted. As a consequence of this identification the logarithmic derivatives of the <b>spectral</b> <b>averages</b> are Jimbo-Miwa-Okamoto σ-functions satisfying second-order second-degree ordinary differential equations. It was noted in the first mentioned works, that while identifying the precise parameters of the Painlevé transcendents involved, the algebraic approach employed could not uniquely specify adequately the boundary conditions that the particular solutions to the differential equations should satisfy. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to rectify this for the bulk scaling case and completely determine the boundary conditions for the differential equations of the σ-form. The plan of our work is as follows- in Section 2 we review the isomonodromic formulation of PVI for generic values of the parameters, give a specific parameterisation of its monodromy matrices and the local expansion of the τ-function about the fixed singularity t = 0. In Section 3 we give the corresponding expansion for...|$|R

The purposes of this research were to determine values and variability of sea surface absorption coefficient in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (NEGOM) based on various seasons. The data were collected in spring, summer, and fall seasons in 1999 - 2000 with AC- 9 instrument. The spatial distribution of absorption coefficient showed that relatively high values were generally found along the run off Missisippi, Mobile, Chochawati, Escambia, Apalachicola, and Suwannee rivers, as well as Tampa Bay. Meanwhile, relatively low values were found in offshore region. This pattern followed the distribution pattern of chlorophyll and CDOM.
