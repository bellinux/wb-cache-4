5000|$|<b>Spotlighting</b> or lamping (also jacklighting and pit-lamping) is {{a method}} of hunting nocturnal animals using {{off-road}} vehicles and high-powered lights, <b>spotlights,</b> lamps or flashlights, that makes special use of the eyeshine revealed by many animal species. A further important aspect is that many animals (e.g. foxes and rabbits) often remain to continually stare at the light and {{do not appear to}} see the light as a threat as they normally would view a human. It is possible to carefully approach animals on foot to a short distance if the bright light is continuously maintained on the animal to greatly improve chances of successful killing. <b>Spotlighting</b> may also be used as a method of surveying nocturnal fauna. Repeated, frequent <b>spotlighting</b> may have a detrimental effect on animals and is discouraged.|$|R

2500|$|All {{lights are}} loosely {{classified}} as either floodlights (wash lights) or <b>spotlights.</b> [...] The distinction {{has to do}} with the degree to which one is able to control the shape and quality of the light produced by the instrument, with <b>spotlights</b> being controllable, sometimes to an extremely precise degree, and floodlights being completely uncontrollable. [...] Instruments that fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum can be classified as either a spot or a flood, depending on the type of instrument and how it is used. [...] In general, <b>spotlights</b> have lenses while floodlights are lensless, although this is not always the case.|$|R
