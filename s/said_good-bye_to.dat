Although Lapitch has <b>said</b> <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> Brewster, the dog joins him the {{following}} morning. Eventually, the two of them visit a young squirrel named Marco (Marko), who lives in a house with a blue star on its walls, and help him round up some geese that went astray while he was tending to the flock.|$|E
2500|$|In 1913 {{he had a}} {{temporary}} break-down partly from over-work, went to England on six months' leave, and soon after World War I broke out in August 1914, acted as a chaplain at the Liverpool camp. He applied for a year's {{leave of absence from}} his school to go to the front in 1916, but the council of the school would not grant it, and Waddy with much regret resigned and <b>said</b> <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> the school at the prizegiving on 16 June. He sailed on 22 August, and whether on a troopship, in camp in England, at the front in France or in Palestine, had the same understanding comradeship with the men as he had had with the boys of his school. He was invalided home to Australia in July 1918 and arrived in September. Soon afterwards he was offered a canonry of St. George's Cathedral, Jerusalem, as Archdeacon for Palestine, Syria and Trans-Jordan then {{he was in charge of}} re-organizing the education work of the Anglican Church there. He was at Jerusalem for over five years, and in July 1924 was appointed secretary of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. As archdeacon he was succeeded by Weston Henry Stewart, who became Bishop of Jerusalem in 1943.|$|E

60|$|We <b>said</b> <b>good-bye</b> again, <b>to</b> the dream-cry of {{some little}} {{fluttering}} {{creature of the}} rushes. And well before dawn I was floating midstream, my friend a memory, Rosinante in clover, and my travels, so far as this brief narrative will tell, nearly ended.|$|R

6000|$|The doctor {{expressed}} satisfaction {{at finding}} {{that his new}} [...] "charitable contributor" [...] took such enlarged views of a pigeon-hole, and, promising to pay him another visit when the [...] "cabin" [...] should have been put <b>to</b> rights, <b>said</b> <b>good-bye,</b> and went <b>to</b> relieve the wants of the sick woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "And it is mine to help you," [...] said Mark, {{an impulse}} of {{youthful}} enthusiasm and sympathy swelling his heart as his mind suddenly reverted {{to the morning}} when he left England, and <b>said</b> his last <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> the fair one with the golden hair and the rosebud mouth and [...] "such lovely blue eyes!" ...|$|R

60|$|So he <b>said</b> <b>good-bye</b> very politely <b>to</b> the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake, {{and helped}} to coil him up on the rock again, and went on, a little warm, but not at all astonished, eating melons, and {{throwing}} the rind about, {{because he could not}} pick it up, till he trod on {{what he thought was a}} log of wood at the very edge of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees.|$|R

The Hialeah Park Race Track also holds the dual distinction of being an Audubon Bird Sanctuary due to its famous pink flamingos and being listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

60|$|The Italian craft was a brig {{of about}} {{a hundred and fifty}} tons burden, but as Edgar was the only {{passenger}} the accommodation was ample. A few minutes after he stepped on board the crew began to get up the anchor, and as soon as this was done, Mr. Muller and Sidi <b>said</b> <b>good-bye</b> and returned <b>to</b> shore. Edgar had, on coming on board, spoken a few words to the captain, who was glad to find that his passenger spoke Italian fluently. The wind was very light, and the brig made but little progress, and five days after sailing was still a hundred miles south of the Italian coast. Edgar, however, greatly enjoyed the time. He was in no particular hurry, and the comparatively cool air and the fresh green of the sea was delightful to him after the dry heat and sandy waste of Egypt.|$|R

50|$|On {{the morning}} of September 15, 1898, the regimental {{property}} including all equipment, firearms and horses were turned {{back over to the}} United States government. The soldiers <b>said</b> one last <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> each other and the United States First Volunteer Cavalry, Roosevelt's Rough Riders, was disbanded at last. Before they all returned to their respective homes across the country, Colonel Roosevelt gave them a short speech that commended their efforts in the war, expressed his profound pride and reminded them that, although heroes, they would have to integrate back into normal society and work as hard as everyone else. Many of the men were unable to gain their jobs back from when they lost them before leaving for war. Some, due to illness or injury, were unable to work for a long time. Money was donated by a number of wealthier supporters of the regiment and used to supplement the well being of the needy veterans, many of whom were too proud to accept the help.|$|R

60|$|At length the {{day came}} on which Miss Wilkinson was to go, and she came down to breakfast, pale and subdued, in a {{serviceable}} travelling dress {{of black and white}} check. She looked a very competent governess. Philip was silent too, for he did not quite know what to say that would fit the circumstance; and he was terribly afraid that, if he said something flippant, Miss Wilkinson would break down before his uncle and make a scene. They had <b>said</b> their last <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> one another in the garden the night before, and Philip was relieved that there was now no opportunity for them to be alone. He remained in the dining-room after breakfast in case Miss Wilkinson should insist on kissing him on the stairs. He did not want Mary Ann, now a woman hard upon middle age with a sharp tongue, to catch them in a compromising position. Mary Ann did not like Miss Wilkinson and called her an old cat. Aunt Louisa was not very well and could not come to the station, but the Vicar and Philip saw her off. Just as the train was leaving she leaned out and kissed Mr. Carey.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, Stephen Knight--you know him. You <b>said</b> <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> him {{not five}} minutes ago. Mayn't he, if {{he happens to}} be in the United States some time, come and see us?" ...|$|E
60|$|We <b>said</b> <b>good-bye</b> at {{the club}} front door. He smiled down at me benevolently {{from the top of}} the steps.|$|R
60|$|Having {{finished}} his story, he <b>said</b> <b>good-bye,</b> and went his way, blown, as it were, {{along the road}} by the wind.|$|R
60|$|After {{a moment}} of silence I <b>said</b> <b>good-bye,</b> but Miss Haldin {{followed}} me into the ante-room, closing the door behind us carefully.|$|R
