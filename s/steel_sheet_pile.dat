The city is surrounded by the Mississippi River to the south, Lake Pontchartrain to the north, and Lake Borgne to the east. Construction of the levees along the River began soon after the city was founded, and more extensive river levees were built as the city grew. The levees were originally designed to prevent damage caused by seasonal flooding. Today, the floodwalls atop the 17th Street and London Avenue Canals are used for drainage, to pump water from the city streets out to Lake Pontchartrain.

5000|$|Work on {{the dock}} began in November 1930. The {{diversion}} of sewer, river embankment, and <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> cofferdam for construction of the new lock were all complete by May 1932. The embankment was constructed primarily of tipped chalk, faced on the seaward side with concrete blocks. Dock construction required excavation of approximately [...] of material, primarily by dragline excavator, much of which was used to fill {{other areas of the}} newly enclosed land. Spoil and slag from Scunthorpe was also used as fill on the reclaimed land. The new 45 ft lock was 240 ft long total with three gates. It was built on 12 in square timber piles, supporting a square bottomed concrete lock pit. 'Blows', (underground springs) were encountered when excavating the lock's west wall foundations, undermining the work, and causing the newly laid concrete to crack. Work was delayed by remedial work to counter these springs, consisting of sunken centrifugal pumps used to draw of the water, temporarily reducing the local level of the water table. The lock was faced with granite. A pipe subway lined with cast iron segmental rings ran under part of the lock, carrying services (hydraulic, water, electricity). The initially installed gates were of oak, operated by hydraulically activated chains. The new east pier was 500 ft long and constructed of timber, on the west side part of the old pier was removed and a new 175 ft pier section added, meeting the old at a [...] "V".|$|E

Outline Deep foundation pit construction is frequently limited by construction site, and has been usually excavated through vertical excavation instead of slope excavation [1]. The <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> supporting structure is a special supporting method for vertical excavation which is widely applied in the basement of high-rise buildings, underground railway, municipal engineering and hydraulic engineering, and it has got better economic benefits and environment effects.

40|$|For {{over three}} {{quarters}} of a century <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls are applied in geotechnical practice. For example in quay walls and construction pits in urban surroundings. <b>Steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls are often composed of so called double U-profiles. These profiles consist of two single U profiles fixed in the common interlock by welding or crimping. A very specific property of the double U-profile is an asymmetric cross-section which can lead to a rotation of the neutral axis. As a result of this, the sheet pile wall tends to deflect both forward (lateral) and sideways (transverse). This phenomenon is called oblique bending. As a result of oblique bending, the strength and lateral stiffness of the sheet pile wall may be decreased considerably up to values of 60 % to 70 % compared to a continuous sheet pile wall. This leads to uneconomical designs. Four different methods to reduce oblique bending in a <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall have been studied: 1) Cantilever sheet pile wall in dry sand. 2) Cantilever <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall with a fix of the horizontal displacement at the top. 3) Cantilever <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall with a capping beam on top. 4) Cantilever <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> with the sliding interlock welded during the excavation. The main goal {{of this study is to}} determine which method is able to give the highest resistance against oblique bending. Therefore calculations have been made with a 3 D-finite element model (DIANA) of a dry excavation of a sand body in front of a cantilever sheet pile wall consisting of double U-profiles. The lower limit of the strength and stiffness is obtained when no transverse bending moment is activated and the in plane deformation is free. The maximum or upper limit strength and stiffness is derived if oblique bending is prevented by fixing the free interlocks (no in plane deformation). Depending on the loading conditions, the stiffness varies from 0. 49 to 1 time the maximum stiffness. The strength appeared to vary from 0. 59 to 1 time the maximum strength. 3 D-finite element calculations have been made for the mentioned four methods to reduce oblique bending. From the 3 D calculations it followed that the use of these methods may increase the strength and stiffness up to about 0. 8 times the maximum value for strength and stiffness. Welding of the interlock during excavation gave the highest reduction of oblique bending. Foundation Engineering GroupHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

As result,, only half the roads are passable by vehicles, and by the implementation of on way system, the flow of traffic became pretty slow. After slope stability analysis using Fellenius method is performed, it is shown that the SF or safety factor of the slope is 0. 665 and for 1. 284 by using Plaxis V. 8. 2 program. Both SF less than normal safety factor which is 1. 3. So it can be inferred that the slope is in critical condition.
