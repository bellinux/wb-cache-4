40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} performance of a synthetic dural sealant {{as an adjunct to}} standard surgical dural repair techniques to prevent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. METHODS: This study was designed as a prospective, nonrandomized, single-center clinical trial. The dural sealant is a synthetic absorbable hydrogel. Consecutive series of patients scheduled for elective cranial and intradural spinal surgery were included until a total of 50 applications were achieved. It was used primarily as an adjunct to ensure watertight dural closure. The end point was defined as no leak with the Valsalva maneuver after dural sealant application. The patients were followed up for 3 months after surgery to check for CSF leakage, standard laboratory and neurological examinations, and possible adverse advents. RESULTS: Of the 49 patients, 46 were included and treated with the dural sealant because of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>leak</b> (n = 34; 69 %) or leak after the Valsalva maneuver (n = 12; 25 %). There was no leak in the other patients (n = 3; 6 %). After application of the dural sealant, there was no leak in all 46 patients (100 %). Of the 46 patients included, there was one case of overt CSF leak. One patient had a pseudomeningocele. There were no adverse events other than those related to the disease or to the surgical procedure itself. CONCLUSION: The dural sealant, a synthetic absorbable hydrogel, is a useful adjunct to achieve watertight dural closure. Application resulted in 100 % closure of intraoperative CSF leaks.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the efficacy and morbidity of repairing spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks {{with the middle}} cranial fossa (MCF) approach {{without the use of}} a lumbar drain (LD), as perioperative use of LD remains controversial. Study Design: Retrospective review from 2003 to 2015. Setting: University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics and Indiana University Health Center. Patients: Those with a confirmed lateral skull base <b>spontaneous</b> CSF <b>leaks</b> and/or encephaloceles. Intervention: MCF approach for repair of <b>spontaneous</b> CSF <b>leak</b> and/or encephalocele without the use of lumbar drain. Assessment of patient age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and medical comorbidities. Main Outcome Measure: <b>Spontaneous</b> CSF <b>leak</b> patient characteristics (age, sex, BMI, obstructive sleep apnea) were collected. Length of stay (LOS), hospital costs, postoperative complications, CSF leak rate, and need for LD were calculated. Results: Sixty-five operative MCF repairs were performed for <b>spontaneous</b> CSF <b>leaks</b> on 60 patients (five had bilateral CSF leaks). CSF diversion with LD was used in 15 of 60 patients, mostly before 2010. After 2010, only three of 44 patients (6. 7 %) had postoperative otorrhea requiring LD. The use of LD resulted in significantly longer LOS (3. 6  ±  1. 6 versus 8. 7  ±  2. 9 d) and hospital costs ($ 29, 621). There were no postoperative complications in 77 % (50 of 65) of cases. Three cases required return to the operating room for complications including frontal subdural hematoma (1), subdural CSF collection (1), and tension pneumocephalus (1). No patients experienced long-term neurologic sequelae or long-term CSF leak recurrence with an average length of follow-up of 19. 5 months (range 3 – 137 mo). The average patient BMI was 37. 5  ±  8. 6  kg/m 2. The average age was 57. 5  ±  11. 4 years and 68 % were female. Obstructive sleep apnea was present in 43. 3 % (26 of 60) of patients. Conclusion: The morbidity of the MCF craniotomy for repair of <b>spontaneous</b> CSF <b>leaks</b> is low and the long-term efficacy of repair is high. Universal use of perioperative lumbar drain is not indicated and significantly increases length of stay and hospital costs. Obesity and obstructive sleep apnea are highly associated with <b>spontaneous</b> CSF <b>leaks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Cerebrospinal {{fluid leaks}} of the {{temporal}} bone are rare, often occult, and sometimes challenging to localize and repair. This is a retrospective study of eight patients with <b>spontaneous</b> cerebrospinal fluid <b>leak</b> and six patients with cerebrospinal fluid leak or encephalocele discovered during chronic ear surgery who were treated in a tertiary medical center over a 5 -year period. All received preoperative temporal bone computed tomography, and six also underwent magnetic resonance imaging, one computed tomography cisternography, and one radionuclide cisternography. All patients initially underwent a transmastoid surgical approach. Additional exposure was necessary in three patients; two underwent middle fossa craniotomy and another required minicraniotomy. Primary surgical repair was successful in six of the eight patients with <b>spontaneous</b> <b>leaks</b> and in all six chronic ear patients. Both recurrences required intradural middle fossa repair. An individualized approach should be taken for repair of temporal bone cerebrospinal fluid leaks. In this series, most were successfully repaired in a single stage using a transmastoid or combined approach.

500|$|<b>Spontaneous</b> CSF <b>leaks</b> {{have been}} {{described}} by notable physicians and reported in medical journals {{dating back to the}} early 1900s. German neurologist Georg Schaltenbrand reported in 1938 and 1953 what he termed [...] "aliquorrhea", a condition marked by very low, unobtainable, or even negative CSF pressures. The symptoms included orthostatic headaches and other features that are now recognized as spontaneous intracranial hypotension. A few decades earlier, the same syndrome had been described in French literature as [...] "hypotension of spinal fluid" [...] and [...] "ventricular collapse". In 1940, Henry Woltman of the Mayo Clinic wrote about [...] "headaches associated with decreased intracranial pressure". The full clinical manifestations of intracranial hypotension and CSF leaks were described in several publications reported between the 1960s and early 1990s. Modern reports of <b>spontaneous</b> CSF <b>leak</b> have been reported to medical journals since the late 1980s.|$|R
5|$|A <b>spontaneous</b> {{cerebrospinal}} fluid <b>leak</b> {{is one of}} several types of {{cerebrospinal fluid}} leaks and occurs due to the presence of one or more holes in the dura. A <b>spontaneous</b> CSF <b>leak,</b> as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically. A loss of CSF greater than its rate of production leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension. Any CSF leak is most often characterized by orthostatic headaches — headaches that worsen in a vertical position and improve when lying down. Other symptoms can include neck pain or stiffness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a metallic taste in the mouth (indicative of a cranial leak). A CT scan can identify the site of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Once identified, the leak can often be repaired by an epidural blood patch, an injection of the patient's own blood {{at the site of the}} leak, a fibrin glue injection or surgery. When the cause cannot be identified the set of symptoms is referred to as <b>spontaneous</b> cerebrospinal fluid <b>leak</b> syndrome (SCSFLS).|$|R
30|$|Headache {{associated}} with spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is often although not always orthostatic (provoked or aggravated {{in upright position}} and decreased or relieved in recumbency). The diagnosis is made based on the synthesis of patient history, clinical findings, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and imaging studies. These headaches, which are now well defined in the scientific literature, can be frontal, occipital, frontooccipital or holocephalic in anatomic location (Scott and Davenport 2014; Mokri 2014). They are often pressure-like, occasionally throbbing, and typically bilateral. With chronicity the orthostatic features of the headache may dampen and they may transform into chronic daily headaches. In some cases the headaches are exertional or may even have thunderclap onset before orthostatic features arise (Spears 2014). Other symptoms that are frequently encountered with the headache include neck or interscapular pain, cochleovestibular symptoms (tinnitus, changes in hearing, dizziness), nausea, emesis, diplopia, mild unsteadiness, memory deficiencies, personality changes {{and a variety of}} less common manifestations; giving rise to a broad spectrum of clinical presentation that can be quite different from classic post dural puncture headaches (Scott and Davenport 2014; Mokri 2014; Spears 2014). CSF opening pressure is often low or borderline but may also be normal. Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) typically shows diffuse pachymeningeal gadolinium enhancement without leptomeningeal enhancement (Mokri 2014; Mitsikostas et al. 2015). Additionally, imaging often reveals evidence of sinking of the brain (descent of cerebellar tonsils and brainstem, crowding of the posterior fossa), subdural fluid collections and pituitary engorgement with enlargement. It is now recognized that nearly all cases of SIH result from <b>spontaneous</b> CSF <b>leaks,</b> which occur {{at the level of the}} spine (Inamasu and Guiot 2006). <b>Spontaneous</b> CSF <b>leak</b> at the level of skull base does occur but only rarely. Evidence of spinal CSF leak may be shown by spine MRI, computed tomography myelography (CTM), or both. In select cases with slow CSF leaks, gadolinium myelography may be helpful (GdM; spine MRI after intrathecal injection of gadolinium). Radioisotope cisternography may also show the site of CSF leakage, but is considered to be less sensitive than CTM. The precise etiology of <b>spontaneous</b> (non-traumatic) CSF <b>leaks</b> is often unclear, but it is now increasingly recognized that some of these patients show evidence of disorder of connective tissue matrix leading to dural weakness that can predispose to <b>spontaneous</b> <b>leaks</b> (Mokri 2014; Schrijver et al. 2002).|$|R
