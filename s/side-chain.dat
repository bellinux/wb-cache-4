5|$|Immunology {{made a great}} advance {{towards the}} end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of humoral {{immunity}} and cellular immunity. Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich, who proposed the <b>side-chain</b> theory to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction; his contributions to the understanding of humoral immunity were recognized by the award of a Nobel Prize in 1908, which was jointly awarded to the founder of cellular immunology, Elie Metchnikoff.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{similarity}} in how proteins bind the two coenzymes, enzymes almost always show {{a high level}} of specificity for either NAD or NADP. This specificity reflects the distinct metabolic roles of the respective coenzymes, and is the result of distinct sets of amino acid residues in the two types of coenzyme-binding pocket. For instance, in the active site of NADP-dependent enzymes, an ionic bond is formed between a basic amino acid <b>side-chain</b> and the acidic phosphate group of NADP. On the converse, in NAD-dependent enzymes the charge in this pocket is reversed, preventing NADP from binding. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule, and enzymes such as aldose reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase can use both coenzymes in some species.|$|E

The flexible <b>side-chains</b> with terminal hydroxy groups were synthesized via SNAr reactions of cyclopentadienyliron-complexed chlorobenzenes with aliphatic diols.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. The primary role of {{substituted}} side chains in organic semiconductors {{is to increase}} their solubility in common organic solvents. In the recent past, many literature reports {{have suggested that the}} side chains {{play a critical role in}} molecular packing and strongly impact the charge transport properties of conjugated polymers. In this work, we have investigated the influence of <b>side-chains</b> on the charge transport behavior of a novel class of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based alternating copolymers. To investigate the role of <b>side-chains,</b> we prepared four diketopyrrolopyrrole-diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP-DPP) conjugated polymers with varied <b>side-chains</b> and carried out a systematic study of thin film microstructure and charge transport properties in polymer thin-film transistors (PTFTs). Combining results obtained from grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) and charge transport properties in PTFTs, we conclude <b>side-chains</b> have a strong influence on molecular packing, thin film microstructure, and the charge carrier mobility of DPP-DPP copolymers. However, the influence of <b>side-chains</b> on optical properties was moderate. The preferential "edge-on" packing and dominant n-channel behavior with exceptionally high field-effect electron mobility values of > 1 cm(2) V- 1 s(- 1) were observed by incorporating hydrophilic (triethylene glycol) and hydrophobic <b>side-chains</b> of alternate DPP units. In contrast moderate electron and hole mobilities were observed by incorporation of branched hydrophobic <b>side-chains.</b> This work clearly demonstrates that the subtle balance between hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity induced by <b>side-chains</b> is a powerful strategy to alter the molecular packing and improve the ambipolar charge transport properties in DPP-DPP based conjugated polymers. Theoretical analysis supports the conclusion that the <b>side-chains</b> influence polymer properties through morphology changes, as there is no effect on the electronic properties in the gas phase. The exceptional electron mobility is at least partially a result of the strong intramolecular conjugation of the donor and acceptor as evidenced by the unusually wide conduction band of the polymer...|$|R

5|$|The BRCA2 helical domain {{adopts a}} helical structure, {{consisting}} of a four-helix cluster core (alpha 1, alpha 8, alpha 9, alpha 10) and two successive beta-hairpins (beta 1 to beta 4). An approximately 50-amino acid segment that contains four short helices (alpha 2 to alpha 4), meanders around {{the surface of the}} core structure. In BRCA2, the alpha 9 and alpha 10 helices pack with the BRCA2 OB1 domain through van der Waals contacts involving hydrophobic and aromatic residues, and also through <b>side-chain</b> and backbone hydrogen bonds. This domain binds the 70-amino acid DSS1 (deleted in split-hand/split foot syndrome) protein, which was originally identified as one of three genes that map to a 1.5-Mb locus deleted in an inherited developmental malformation syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The <b>side-chain</b> of the {{nucleophilic}} residue performs covalent catalysis on the substrate. The lone pair {{of electrons}} {{present on the}} oxygen or sulphur attacks the electropositive carbonyl carbon. The 20 naturally occurring biological amino acids do not contain any sufficiently nucleophilic functional groups for many difficult catalytic reactions. Embedding the nucleophile in a triad increases its reactivity for efficient catalysis. The most commonly used nucleophiles are the hydroxyl (OH) of serine and the thiol/thiolate ion (SH/S−) of cysteine. Alternatively, threonine proteases use the secondary hydroxyl of threonine, however due to steric hindrance of the side chain's extra methyl group such proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, rather than a separate amino acid.|$|E
5|$|Because protein {{structures}} {{are composed of}} amino acids whose side chains are linked by a common protein backbone, {{a number of different}} possible subsets of the atoms that make up a protein macromolecule can be used in producing a structural alignment and calculating the corresponding RMSD values. When aligning structures with very different sequences, the side chain atoms generally are not taken into account because their identities differ between many aligned residues. For this reason it is common for structural alignment methods to use by default only the backbone atoms included in the peptide bond. For simplicity and efficiency, often only the alpha carbon positions are considered, since the peptide bond has a minimally variant planar conformation. Only when the structures to be aligned are highly similar or even identical is it meaningful to align <b>side-chain</b> atom positions, in which case the RMSD reflects not only the conformation of the protein backbone but also the rotameric states of the side chains. Other comparison criteria that reduce noise and bolster positive matches include secondary structure assignment, native contact maps or residue interaction patterns, measures of side chain packing, and measures of hydrogen bond retention.|$|E
5000|$|Ehrlich {{supposed}} that living cells have <b>side-chains</b> {{in the same}} way dyes have <b>side-chains</b> which are related to their coloring properties. These side chains can link with a particular toxin (or any antigen), just as Emil Fischer said enzymes must bind to their receptors [...] "as lock and key." ...|$|R
50|$|Thus, an {{essential}} parameter of any design {{process is the}} amount of flexibility allowed for both the <b>side-chains</b> and the backbone. In the simplest models, the protein backbone is kept rigid while some of the protein <b>side-chains</b> are allowed to change conformations. However, <b>side-chains</b> can have many degrees of freedom in their bond lengths, bond angles, and &chi; dihedral angles. To simplify this space, protein design methods use rotamer libraries that assume ideal values for bond lengths and bond angles, while restricting &chi; dihedral angles to a few oft-observed low-energy conformations termed rotamers.|$|R

5|$|The acidic triad member forms a {{hydrogen}} {{bond with the}} basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its <b>side-chain</b> rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge. Two amino acids have acidic side chains at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) {{and so are the}} most commonly used for this triad member. Cytomegalovirus protease uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid. The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, papain uses asparagine as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, hepatitis A virus protease contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.|$|E
25|$|A {{compressor}} with a <b>side-chain</b> input controls {{gain from}} main input to output {{based on the}} level of the signal at the <b>side-chain</b> input. The compressor behaves in the conventional manner when both inputs are supplied with the same signal. The <b>side-chain</b> input is used by disc jockeys for ducking – lowering the music volume automatically when speaking. The DJ's microphone signal is routed to the <b>side-chain</b> input so that whenever the DJ speaks the compressor reduces the volume of the music. A sidechain with equalization controls can be used to reduce the volume of signals that have a strong spectral content within a certain frequency range: it can act as a de-esser, reducing the level of vocal sibilance in the range of 6–9kHz. A de-esser helps reduce high frequencies that tend to overdrive preemphasized media (such as phonograph records and FM radio). Another use of the <b>side-chain</b> in music production serves to maintain a loud bass track without the bass drum causing undue peaks that result in loss of overall headroom.|$|E

25|$|Like other steroid hormones, {{testosterone}} {{is derived}} from cholesterol (see figure). The {{first step in the}} biosynthesis involves the oxidative cleavage of the <b>side-chain</b> of cholesterol by cholesterol <b>side-chain</b> cleavage enzyme (P450scc, CYP11A1), a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 oxidase with the loss of six carbon atoms to give pregnenolone. In the next step, two additional carbon atoms are removed by the CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase) enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum to yield a variety of C19 steroids. In addition, the 3β-hydroxyl group is oxidized by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to produce androstenedione. In the final and rate limiting step, the C17 keto group androstenedione is reduced by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to yield testosterone.|$|E

We demonstrate that although these <b>side-chains</b> can reduce the π−π stacking structural order of these copolymers to affect the hole transport properties, the methoxy unit introduces a desired defect passivation effect. Compared to the Spiro-OMeTAD-based device, the copolymer with methoxy <b>side-chains</b> on the BT unit (namely PCDTBT 1) as the HTM achieved superior power conversion efficiency and stability due to efficient hole transport and the suppression of trap-induced degradation, whilst the copolymer with octyloxy <b>side-chains</b> on the BT unit (namely PCDTBT 8) as the HTM lead to poor performance and stability...|$|R

25|$|One of {{the keys}} to {{developing}} COX-2 selective drugs is the larger active site of COX-2, which makes it possible to make molecules too large to fit into the COX-1 active site but still able to fit the COX-2. The larger active site of COX-2 is partly due to a polar hydrophilic side-pocket that forms because of substitution of Ile523, His513, and Ile434 in COX-1 by Val523, Arg513, and Val434 in COX-2. Val523 is less bulky than Ile523, which increases the volume of the active site. Substitution of Ile434 for Val434 allows the <b>side-chain</b> of Phe518 to move back and make some extra space. This side-pocket allows for interactions with Arg513, which is a replacement for His513 of COX-1. Arg513 is thought to be a key residue for diaryl heterocycle inhibitors such as the coxibs. The <b>side-chain</b> of Leu384, {{at the top of the}} receptor channel, is oriented into the active site of COX-1, but, in COX-2, it is oriented away from the active site and makes more space in the apex of the binding site.|$|E
