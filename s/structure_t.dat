50|$|An m {{dimensional}} integral current space (X,d,T) is a metric space (X,d) with an m-dimensional integral current <b>structure</b> <b>T.</b> More precisely, using {{notions of}} Ambrosio-Kirchheim, T is an m-dimensional integral current on the metric completion of X, and X is {{the set of}} positive density of the mass measure of T. As a consequence of deep theorems of Ambrosio-Kirchheim, X is then a countably Hm rectifiable metric space, so it is covered Hm almost everywhere by the images of bi-Lipschitz charts from compact subsets of Rm, it is endowed with an integer valued weight function and it has an orientation. In addition an integral current space has a well defined notion of boundary which is an (m &minus; 1)-dimensional integral current space. A 0-dimensionalintegral current space is a finite collection of points with integer valued weights. One special integral current space found in every dimension is the 0 space.|$|E

Reprocessing of high energy radiation in a steady-state blackbody accretion disc with T / R Γ 3 = 4 incurs a wavelength-dependent light travel time delay ø / 4 = 3. The International AGN Watch multiwavelength monitoring campaign on NGC 7469 showed optical continuum variations lagging behind those in the UV by about 1 day at 4800 A and about 2 days at 7500 A. These UV/optical continuum lags imply a radial temperature <b>structure</b> <b>T</b> / R Γ 3 = 4, consistent with the classical accretion disc model, and hence strongly supports the existence of a disc in this system.
