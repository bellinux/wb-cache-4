5|$|The Medieval Merchant's House {{was built}} in about 1290 on FrenchStreet, Southampton, then a major port and a large provincial town with a {{population}} of around 5,000, grown rich from the trade with England's continental possessions in Europe. The area of Southampton around FrenchStreet had been re-planned earlier in the century, reducing the numbers of farm animals kept in and around the houses, driving poorer merchants and craftsmen into the less desirable northern half of the city, and creating a quarter of large, impressive houses, often built in stone with tiled roofs. The original house was designed for use by John Fortin, a prosperous wine merchant, with a vaulted cellar for holding stock, a <b>shop</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front of the property and accommodation for the family; much of it {{was built in}} stone, but it featured a timber front, a fashionable design for the period. At least 60 other houses similar to the Medieval Merchant's House were built in Southampton at around the same time.|$|E

Many historians believe that Gambino ordered caporegime Joseph Biondo to kill Anastasia and Biondo gave the contract to a squad of Gambino drug dealers led by Stephen Armone and Steven Grammauta.|$|E

25|$|A {{more modest}} but highly useful invention, the folding umbrella, was {{introduced}} in 1710 by a Paris merchant named Jean Marius, with his <b>shop</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> barrier of Saint-Honoré.

A model was purchased in 1712 by the Princess Palatine, who wrote about it to her friends and helped make it a popular fashion item. An important improvement was reported to the French Academy of Sciences in 1759; an umbrella combined with a cane, with a small button the side to open the umbrella.|$|E
