40|$|A new full arm {{have been}} {{designed}} and produced {{to fill the gap}} in the rehabilitative devices commercially available for the upper limb amputees. The main features of this system are the low weight, low noise, wide working area, and a user friendly approach to its command. The artificial limb is characterized by many servo actuated axes: two for the shoulder, one for the elbow, one for the wrist and at least one for the hand. This multi-axes architecture excludes any chance to use the sequential approach to the joints motion usually adopted in current active arm prostheses. In order to reduce the mental load, to the subject is only required to focus on the hand motion, driving it without taking into account any other part of the limb kinematic chain. Knowing the target of the hand, the system automatically manages the joints' motion: a central unit synchronizes the axes motion in order to follow the target as fast as possible and peripheral units control separately each brushless motor law of motion. The motors are controlled by two closed loop, in velocity and position using as references the hall sensors; <b>soft</b> <b>stops</b> are also guaranteed by the software. The system follows the requests of the subject changing the motion target during the movement. At present the hand is driven by the patient by means of the head, only the grasping function is directly obtained by processing electromyographic signals.

Recent tests have shown that the distance from the hand to the head can be profitably driven, without increasing the subject pressure, also by means an extra electro-mechanical or electro-miographic sensor.

In addition, they enable wafer-level and batch fabrication processes compatible with microfabrication techniques. We designed test devices to reflect the effect of impact force and fabricated them using silicon microbeams (nonlinear springs) or Parylene coating (soft coating). After conducting multiple shock tests (up to 2500 g), we demonstrate that the shock-survival rates of test devices are considerably improved in both our novel technologies (nonlinear spring: 88 %, soft coating: 94 %) compared to conventional hard stops (4 %). Moreover, we demonstrated that shock protection is improved by optimizing the design of shock springs. Finally, we analyzed dynamics of flexible beams and identified a new device-fracture mechanism induced by impact force, which is different from conventionally known mechanisms.

40|$|Laboratory {{data are}} {{critical}} to analyzing and improving clinical quality. In the setting of residual use of creatine kinase M and B isoenzyme testing for myocardial infarction, we assessed disease outcomes of discordant creatine kinase M and B isoenzyme +/troponin I (−) test pairs {{in order to address}} anticipated clinician concerns about potential loss of case-finding sensitivity following proposed discontinuation of routine creatine kinase and creatine kinase M and B isoenzyme testing. Time-sequenced interventions were introduced. The main outcome was the percentage of cardiac marker studies performed within guidelines. Nonguideline orders dominated at baseline. Creatine kinase M and B isoenzyme testing in 7496 order sets failed to detect additional myocardial infarctions but was associated with 42 potentially preventable admissions/quarter. Interruptive computerized <b>soft</b> <b>stops</b> improved guideline compliance from 32. 3 % to 58 % (P 80 % (P <. 001) with peer leadership that featured dashboard feedback about test order performance. This successful experience was recapitulated in interrupted time series within 2 additional services within facility 1 and then in 2 external hospitals (including a critical access facility). Improvements have been sustained postintervention. Laboratory cost savings at the academic facility were estimated to be ≥US$ 635 000 per year. National collaborative data indicated that facility 1 improved its order patterns from fourth to first quartile compared to peer norms and imply that nonguideline orders persist elsewhere. This example illustrates how pathologists can provide leadership in assisting clinicians in changing laboratory ordering practices. We found that clinicians respond to local laboratory data about their own test performance and that evidence suggesting harm is more compelling to clinicians than evidence of cost savings. Our experience indicates that interventions done at an academic facility can be readily instituted by private practitioners at external facilities. The intervention data also supplement existing literature that electronic order interruptions are more successful when combined with modalities that rely on peer education combined with dashboard feedback about laboratory order performance. The findings may have implications for the role of the pathology laboratory in the ongoing pivot from quantity-based to value-based health care...|$|R

We define physical (pole) masses for the top-quark, by including QCD selfenergies, and for the neutral Higgs bosons, by including the leading one-loop electroweak self-energies where the top/stop and bottom/sbottom sectors propagate.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the water and}} tissue equivalence of a new PRESAGE® 3 D dosimeter for proton therapy. Methods: The GEANT 4 software toolkit was used to calculate and compare total dose delivered by a proton beam with mean energy 62 MeV in a PRESAGE® dosimeter, water, and soft tissue. The dose delivered by primary protons and secondary particles was calculated. Depth-dose profiles and isodose contours of deposited energy were compared for the materials of interest. Results: The proton beam range {{was found to be}} ≈ 27 mm for PRESAGE®, 29. 9 mm for soft tissue, and 30. 5 mm for water. This {{can be attributed to the}} lower collisional stopping power of water compared to soft tissue and PRESAGE®. The difference between total dose delivered in PRESAGE® and total dose delivered in water or tissue is less than 2 % across the entire water/tissue equivalent range of the proton beam. The largest difference between total dose in PRESAGE® and total dose in water is 1. 4 %, while for soft tissue it is 1. 8 %. In both cases, this occurs at the distal end of the beam. Nevertheless, the authors find that PRESAGE® dosimeter is overall more tissue-equivalent than water-equivalent before the Bragg peak. After the Bragg peak, the differences in the depth doses are found to be due to differences in primary proton energy deposition; PRESAGE® and <b>soft</b> tissue <b>stop</b> protons more rapidly than water. The dose delivered by secondary electrons in the PRESAGE® differs by less than 1 % from that in soft tissue and water. The contribution of secondary particles to the total dose is less than 4 % for electrons and ≈ 1 % for protons in all the materials of interest. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the new PRESAGE® formula may be considered both a tissue- and water-equivalent 3 D dosimeter for a 62 MeV proton beam. The results further suggest that tissue-equivalent thickness may provide better dosimetric and geometric accuracy than water-equivalent thickness for 3 D dosimetry of this proton beam. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Vortex-Induced Vibrations (VIV) are {{a complex}} fluid-structure {{interaction}} problem. VIV are particularly strong for low-mass structures {{subject to a}} low damping, as encountered in the offshore industry, in which structures experiencing VIV can also be subject to strong structural non-linearities. In this project, investigation of the VIV of a low-mass low-damping rigid cylinder subject to structural non-linearities is carried out first experimentally. Non-linearities considered are the symmetric or asymmetric limitation of the amplitude of the cylinder with <b>soft</b> or stiff <b>stops</b> placed at different offsets from the cylinder and implying a non-smooth non-linearity of the system. Experimental results show that a strong perturbation {{of the dynamics of}} the cylinder occurs when amplitude limitation is strong, and flow visualisations displaying a modification of the vortex wake suggest a change in the fluid-structure interaction affecting the vortex formation process. Attention is also given to the impact velocities in the different cases of amplitude limitation with stiff stops, as they are an important factor in the design of structures. Two different wake oscillator models are then used to simulate the VIV of the same rigid circular cylinder in the same conditions of non-linear structural restraints.
