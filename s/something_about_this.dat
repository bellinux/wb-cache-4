"My {{favorite}} {{thing that we}} ever recorded, ever—or wrote—is 'Oh Father'... because we knew when we did it, that there was <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> that was in a way kind of the most *real* thing. [...] that song, the 'record' button was only pressed three times. That's it. So it's real. It's something that I {{really wanted to do}} and she was kind enough to say 'let's try this,' and it was not easy." ...|$|E
500|$|Assigned {{to direct}} the film, Kusama said, [...] "I think {{also a lot of}} horror is about femaleness – whether it's Carrie or Rosemary's Baby." [...] She said she feels [...] "like there's a lot of fear of the female or kind of celebration of it in some weird way and <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> movie managed to take the fear and the sense that it's the female that {{ultimately}} survives and sort of marry that in a really interesting way".|$|E
500|$|A 16-second video snippet {{was posted}} on Gaga's Twitter, showing Gaga dancing {{in a desert}} with strobe lights {{flashing}} around her, with the same chord beats being repeated. Gaga appeared on BBC Radio 1's Breakfast Show on September 9, 2016, alongside host Nick Grimshaw and premiered [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] for the radio. The singer described the release as [...] "overwhelming" [...] and like a [...] "rebirth" [...] while adding {{that she had been}} [...] "in the studio for months and months and now it's in the world [...] It feels like the first time. <b>Something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> song, it feels like I'm a new artist." [...] She also sang a few lines of the track.|$|E

500|$|The {{performances}} of the lead characters were generally praised, especially Basset's. In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin said that [...] "Mr. Fiennes gleefully captures Lenny's sleaziness while also showing there is <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> schlockmeister that is worth saving, despite much evidence to the contrary. As for Ms. Bassett, she looks great and radiates inner strength even without the bone-crunching physical feats to which she is often assigned." [...] Similarly, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Strange Days Bigelow's [...] "magnum opus", and added, [...] "In a film of striking performances, Bassett's is the standout—she is fierce, funny and heart rending". In contrast, Sizemore and Lewis were considered miscast in their roles. At the 22nd Saturn Awards, Bassett won Best Actress and Bigelow {{became the first woman}} to win the Best Director award.|$|E
500|$|Catriona Wightman of Digital Spy wrote, [...] "This was a {{confusing}} episode of Glee. For a while, it seemed pretty unremarkable—a standard installment, meandering along enjoyably enough. But then, {{in the last}} few minutes, it suddenly got really rather dark indeed. I'm intrigued about what happens next." [...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Mash Off" [...] a [...] "C" [...] grade, and felt that the episode did not reach its full potential. He wrote, [...] "The gut-punch moment is sufficiently gut-punchy, and we'll {{get to that in a}} bit. But everything building up to it is so messy that the solidly dramatic moment almost made me angry. There's <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> show that leads to messy tonal mash-ups. But where the show's musical mash-ups are usually pretty harmonious, the tonal shifts can often be brutally unsubtle." [...] James Poniewozik of Time felt that it was notably inferior to the previous episode, with many more [...] "forgettable scenes and stories".|$|E
500|$|Of the victory, Baffert said, [...] "this little horse deserves it. There's <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> {{horse that}} he just brought it every time. He's a joy to be around." [...] In a post-race interview, Zayat said that the colt's racing {{schedule}} {{for the remainder of}} the year would be decided by Baffert, and that the needs of the horse would come first. He also acknowledged the need for horse racing to have [...] "stars" [...] and for them to race as long as they could. Though American Pharoah's stud rights had been sold with plans to retire the horse at the end of 2015, Zayat expressed hope that the horse would continue racing as long as he was healthy and [...] "has it in him". His winning time of 2:26.65 was the sixth-fastest in Belmont history, the second-fastest for a Triple Crown winner, and his closing quarter-mile was run in 24.32 seconds, which was over a half-second faster than Secretariat's final quarter-mile time of 25.00 when the 1973 winner set a world record and won by 31 lengths.|$|E

500|$|In January1994, Simon co-created with comedian George Carlin {{the sitcom}} The George Carlin Show for Fox. It aired for 27 episodes before being {{canceled}} in December1995. Simon served as showrunner throughout its run and directed several episodes. Simon persuaded Carlin {{to do the}} show after writing it as something which would not be [...] "typically sitcomy." [...] He conceived the show as what Carlin's {{life would have been}} like had he never become a comedian; Carlin played a heavy drinking New York taxi driver. Simon commented: [...] "When I was doing The Simpsons, people couldn't see how smart {{it was because of the}} low moments. There's <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> show. People who like it say it's classy. They don't see how vulgar it is." [...] Carlin wrote negatively of his relationship with Simon. On his own website, Carlin wrote of the show: [...] "always check mental health of creative partner beforehand. Loved the actors, loved the crew. Had a great time. Couldn't wait to get the fuck out of there." [...] In his final book, the posthumously published Last Words (2009), Carlin elaborated: [...] "I had a great time. I never laughed so much, so often, so hard as I did with cast members Alex Rocco, Chris Rich, Tony Starke. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor on that stage ... The biggest problem, though, was that Sam Simon was a fucking horrible person to be around. Very, very funny, extremely bright and brilliant, but an unhappy person who treated other people poorly." [...] Simon described himself as [...] "combative" [...] and said that most people see him as having a [...] "bad attitude".|$|E
2500|$|Korigatachi (...) {{is often}} {{translated}} as 'over-concentrated', but more literally is 'frozen shape'. If a player uses his stones in an inefficient way, {{the result will}} be korigatachi. Knowing <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> problem should tell you how to avoid it. Placing stones too close together is a fundamental mistake, rather than safe play.|$|E
2500|$|The Scientific Outlook (1931) by philosopher Bertrand Russell. When Brave New World was {{released}}, Russell {{thought that}} Huxley's book {{was based on}} his book The Scientific Outlook, released the previous year. Russell contacted his own publisher and asked whether he should do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> [...] "apparent plagiarism". His publisher advised him not to, and Russell followed this advice.|$|E

2500|$|After {{recording}} The Midnight Organ Fight, {{the current}} quartet line-up was completed {{with the addition}} of guitarist/keyboardist Andy Monaghan of Piano Bar Fight (who have previously played as support to Frightened Rabbit). In an interview, Scott mentions that he [...] "met him on New Year's Eve, in Glasgow, in a bar. I was really hammered and I was like 'why don't you come and play some shows with us man?' and he was like 'Yeah!'. The next day, I got a text like 'Do you remember… did you say <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> or is it my imagination?'".|$|E
2500|$|Henry Miller's Theatre, on West 43rd Street in New York City, {{was renamed}} the Stephen Sondheim Theatre on September 15, 2010 for the composer's 80th birthday. In {{attendance}} were Nathan Lane, Patti LuPone and John Weidman. Sondheim said {{in response to}} the honor, [...] "I'm deeply embarrassed. Thrilled, but deeply embarrassed. I've always hated my last name. It just doesn't sing. I mean, it's not Belasco. And it's not Rodgers and it's not Simon. And it's not Wilson. It just doesn't sing. It sings better than Schoenfeld and Jacobs. But it just doesn't sing". Lane said, [...] "We love our corporate sponsors and we love their money, but there's something sacred about naming a theatre, and there's <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> that is right and just".|$|E
2500|$|While {{critics were}} divided {{following}} the symphony's premiere, the public generally admired the piece as its grandiose finale was connected by some with {{the struggle for}} Finland's independence, {{so that it was}} even popularly dubbed the [...] "Symphony of Independence", as it was written at a time of Russian sanctions on Finnish language and culture. Sibelius's reaction to this has been widely debated; some claim that he had not intended any patriotic message and that the symphony was only identified by others as a nationalist composition, while others believe that he wrote the piece with an independent Finland in mind. Finnish composer Sulho Ranta said, [...] "There is <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> music — at least for us — that leads us to ecstasy; almost like a shaman with his magic drum." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An' there's <b>something</b> else <b>about</b> <b>this</b> outfit of yourn that I don't get {{the hang}} of," [...] he pursued. [...] "I can't just {{put my finger on}} it, but it's there all right." ...|$|R
5000|$|Several days later, Kennedy {{decided to}} create his own anti-poverty program. He told speechwriter Adam Walinsky, [...] "I want to do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> all <b>this.</b> Some kind of project that goes after some of these problems...see what you can put together." ...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "Phoney War" [...] was {{probably}} coined by US Senator William Borah, who, commenting in September 1939 on the inactivity on the Western Front, said, [...] "There is <b>something</b> phoney <b>about</b> <b>this</b> war." ...|$|R
2500|$|Basil {{was first}} modeled on Bing Crosby, but the animators {{eventually}} took inspiration from Leslie Howard. Initially, Ratigan {{had been designed}} as thin, weasely, and ratlike. Following the screening of Champagne for Caesar, Glen Keane noted that following the casting of Price, [...] "is expressive voice and attitude inspired us to further redesign the character." [...] Additionally, during one story meeting, Glen Keane decided to base the stature of Ratigan on then-Disney CEO Ron Miller, who was a 6'6" [...] former football player for the Los Angeles Rams. Furthermore, Keane lifted his personality as he was thumbing through these [...] "photographs of people of London in the 1800s, of railroad men, {{and there was this}} one guy smoking a cigar — he had a top hat and there was just <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> guy — this Ratigan...this rat sucking the cigar, completely dressed to the hilt, he was sharp and perfect — he's a sewer rat dressed like a king and he lives as a king!" [...] The following supervising animators included Mark Henn for Basil, Hendel Butoy for Dawson, Rob Minkoff for Olivia, Andreas Deja for Queen Moustoria, Ruben Aquino for Mrs. Judson, and Mike Gabriel for Toby and Felicia.|$|E

6000|$|Brown nodded. [...] "The old fellow has {{an eye for}} all that's useful; I reckon he sees {{farther than}} any man I know. There's <b>something</b> {{encouraging}} <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> because the job he's given us looks tough--" ...|$|R

60|$|Deane {{was silent}} for several moments. He was feeling nervous and disturbed. There was <b>something</b> uncanny <b>about</b> <b>this</b> quiet, {{persistent}} denial,--the still face, the steadfast, beautiful eyes, which seemed yet like unlit fires devoid of sympathy or apprehension.|$|R
