500|$|While {{the bulk}} of the film was shot on 4:4:4 HDCAM, {{according}} to director Guggenheim, a vast array of different film formats were used: [...] "There’s 35mm and 16mm. A lot of the <b>stuff</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> farm I just shot myself on 8mm film. We used four Sony F950 HDCAMs for the presentation. We shot three different kinds of prosumer HD, both 30 and 24. There’s MiniDV, there’s 3200 black-and-white stills, there’s digital stills, some of them emailed on the day they were taken from as far off as Greenland. There was three or four different types of animation. One of the animators is from New Zealand and emailed me his work. There’s JPEG stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis {{received}} a tweet on June 30 from Michael Tran in Michigan asking {{him if he}} had ever used steroids. He responded [...] "No", that same day. Davis said later in an interview, [...] "I have not ever taken any PEDs. I'm not sure fans realize, we have the strictest drug testing in all of sports, even more than the Olympics. If anybody {{was going to try to}} cheat in our game, they couldn't. It's impossible to try to beat the system. Anyway, I've never taken PEDs, no. I wouldn't. Half the <b>stuff</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> list I can't even pronounce." [...] Later, Davis would say that he believed Roger Maris's 61 home run season was the true single-season home run record, due to the steroid scandal surrounding Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, and Mark McGwire.|$|E
500|$|Musically True Blue was a {{different}} direction for Madonna. Her previous efforts had her singing in a high pitched voice. With this album, Madonna toned it down for a more bubblegum-pop voice. The songs on the album reflect this {{and a number of}} instruments were used in the songs to bring out the different moods which the lyrics emphasized. [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] features acoustic, electric, and rhythm guitars, keyboards, and string arrangements. The song samples Beethoven's Appassionata sonata. A continuous percussion filled structure was used in [...] "Open Your Heart". [...] "White Heat" [...] sampling of the film's quotation was included with speech and gunshots. It is an uptempo dance song with synth bass and double-tracked vocals supported by male voices in the chorus. [...] "I don't write dance music and I don't see it as contributing to the cultural growth of the world," [...] grumbled Pat Leonard in 1992. [...] "At the time we were doing the groove <b>stuff</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> True Blue album, it was semi-innovative. There wasn't a precedent that made you gag. God forbid that I might have contributed to the mess we're in now." ...|$|E

In front of a crowd of 10,000, in three services at Valley Bible Fellowship in Bakersfield, California, said [...] "I was addicted to methamphetamines and tried everything ... rehab, <b>stuff</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet, but nothing helped me kick it. I was trying on my own to quit and couldn't do it. I wanted to die. No one knew what I was going through. I could not quit. Church was my last shot. I would sit in church high [...] I would wonder why people would go up to the front after the service. But one day it was for me. I said , 'Show me how to quit.'" [...] In a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Head described his final moments in the band as very tense; [...] "the last year I was in the band, we were gonna kick out the bass player, Fieldy, and this guy's girlfriend couldn't be {{on this side of the}} stage because there were fights with another wife in the band. And obviously the drugs – it's no secret I was into the drugs, so crazy stuff, like having to finish our blow right before we got to the border because they were gonna come check to see if we had anything." [...] Following his departure from Korn, Welch released two autobiographies, a solo album, and formed a band, Love and Death, who released a debut album in 2013.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{not clear}} if Dupré would use her notoriety to gain modeling, interview, sit-com cameo, or reality {{television}} opportunities. According to Andy Greene, assistant editor at Rolling Stone magazine quoted in Advertising Age magazine, [...] "If {{she was in the}} studio with a producer, her voice is not that much worse than Britney Spears'. … It's not inconceivable that she could have a song as good as the <b>stuff</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> charts. … It's a really tough road for her to have a music career because she's a prostitute. … She had sex with Gov. Spitzer, and that's fascinating to a lot of people. But people ultimately want to read her book or see her interviewed by Oprah or Barbara Walters. They don't want to listen to her third or fourth song." ...|$|E

We were going to make an open and honest film and that we weren't going to leave the good <b>stuff</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cutting room floor." [...] Rudolph explained that For the Record is part of the game plan for reintroducing Spears back to her fans as a pop star rather than a tabloid fixture.|$|E

2500|$|In 1916, Love {{appeared}} in 20 {{games for the}} Yankees, all but one as a relief pitcher, and compiled a 2–0 record with a 4.91 ERA.

At {{the end of the}} 1916 season, Sporting Life reported on Love's lack of control:"Bill Donovan has hopes that Slim Love will win a regular place on the New Yorks' pitching staff next season. Love simply lacks confidence in his own great ability. In batting practice when he puts his <b>stuff</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ball, Love usually has the New York hitters helpless. At such times his control is exceptional. When sent into a game wildness, as a rule, forces him to let up on his stuff, and his batting practice speed and curves are missing." ...|$|E

We became a better band and that was a good period for the band." [...] Keyboardist Mic Michaeli was soon recruited to play in live concerts, and became an official member of the band shortly after. At the same time, Tony Reno was fired because of his lack of motivation and alleged slacking off on rehearsals. Bassist Peter Olsson also claims that Reno was replaced on the albums by a drum machine. His replacement was Ian Haugland.|$|E

But a kid will be acutely aware that he doesn't have pocket money. Or that he doesn't have as much pocket money. I think back to myself at 11. Kids can be mean, very mean.

2500|$|Predicting {{critical}} reception to the {{new direction}} of the album, Cronise proposed that [...] "It will absolutely alienate some fans. The kind of music we play is partially described as heavy metal and unfortunately, a lot of dudes that like heavy metal are very narrow-minded and only like it to sound one particular way. So I'm sure we alienated people with our second album." [...] Despite this, he assured that {{the sound of the}} music would not change as much, explaining that [...] "There'll definitely still be heavy <b>stuff</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> record, and fast, thrashy, and slow and sludgy stuff like we've done before. Heavy metal, basically. But a lot of the songs are just what I'd call hard rock songs. The attitude and the vibe is different. It's not as aggressive, sonically. It's a little bit more ... I don't know how to explain it. It's just rock. It's a rock album. Some parts will be heavier than the heaviest stuff we've done, but at the same time, there will be acoustic stuff. It is a varied record, I guess.|$|E
