50|$|<b>Solder</b> mask or <b>solder</b> stop mask or <b>solder</b> resist {{is a thin}} lacquer-like {{layer of}} polymer that is usually applied to the copper traces of {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) for {{protection}} against oxidation and to prevent <b>solder</b> bridges from forming between closely spaced <b>solder</b> pads. A <b>solder</b> bridge is an unintended electrical connection between two conductors by means of a small blob of <b>solder.</b> PCBs use <b>solder</b> masks to prevent this from happening. <b>Solder</b> mask is not always used for hand <b>soldered</b> assemblies, but is essential for mass-produced boards that are <b>soldered</b> automatically using reflow or <b>solder</b> bath techniques.

The actual <b>solder</b> joint shape designs of BLP devices can be instructed based on predicted results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Printed {{circuit boards}} (PCBs) are being {{widely used in}} the {{electronic}} packages. <b>Solder</b> joints are often used to interconnect chip resistors and other components onto PCBs. The defects of <b>solder</b> joints will increase quality costs and deteriorate performance. If <b>solder</b> joints can’t be located accuracy, AOI system will not inspect <b>solder</b> joints at the right place of <b>solder</b> joints and must lead to misjudgement. Especially, the misjudgement will increase dramatically under uncertain noise disturbance to micro-size <b>solder</b> joints due to inaccuracy location. In this work, an eliminating uncertain noise method is proposed and a robust location algorithm for PCB’s <b>solder</b> joints is present. Firstly, some location windows are set based on technology parameters of chip and its <b>solder</b> joints, and <b>solder</b> joints feature image is obtained from it <b>solder</b> joint image based on series of image pre-processing. Secondly, the layout frame outside <b>solder</b> joints, which {{is viewed as a}} noise disturbance to location, is extracted as a binary image and is projected to X axis and Y axis, then the smaller region, which include <b>solder</b> joints but no the layout frame, is obtained based on calculating the sum features function of layout frame. Thirdly, the blob feature image of <b>solder</b> joints is extracted from its gray images of red, green, blue layers; it may have some noise blob around <b>solder</b> joints feature, then an evaluation function is develop to judge blob, which maybe belongs to noise or <b>solder</b> joints feature, and only <b>solder</b> joints feature are remained. Fourthly, with the help of setting <b>solder</b> joints windows, the integrated projection method is developed to locate <b>solder</b> joints. Finally, the proposed location method is compared with other two algorithms in the experiment. Experiment’s result illustrates that the smaller the <b>solder</b> joint size, the better location accuracy and efficiency is obtained than other two mothers. ...|$|R
5|$|Welding is a {{fabrication}} or sculptural {{process that}} joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing fusion, which {{is distinct from}} lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and <b>soldering,</b> which do not melt the base metal.

Pressure may also be {{used in conjunction with}} heat, or by itself, to produce a weld. Welding also requires a form of shield to protect the filler metals or melted metals from being contaminated or oxidized.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other materials, copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred.

Researches {{and studies}} on {{composite}} <b>solder</b> {{have been done}} by many researchers {{in an effort to}} develop viable lead-free <b>solders</b> which can replace the conventional lead-based <b>solders</b> as lead is considered as toxic. <b>Solder</b> materials developed by composite approach showed improvement in their properties and importantly it improved their service performance when compared with <b>solder</b> materials developed by other methods. This paper reviews the <b>solder</b> properties of various types of composite lead-free <b>solder</b> that were fabricated via powder metallurgy route. The fabrication processes of the composite <b>solder</b> material by using powder metallurgy route which involved mixing the powder homogeneously, compaction of the mixed powder and sintering the green body were discussed in detail.
