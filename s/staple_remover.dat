5|$|In Blessing, Tennessee, Jared Chirp, while {{attempting}} to flee his home, is attacked by rattlesnakes inside his car and killed. Federal agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), after conferring with the completely ordinary Reverend Mackey, go to Reverend Enoch O'Connor's church, Church of God with Signs and Wonders, where Biblical literalism is stressed and snakes are used during his services. As such, O'Connor becomes the prime suspect. Later, a woman named Iris tells Reverend Mackey that she feels guilty because Jared called her on the night he died in order {{to talk to his}} girlfriend, Gracie. Iris, however, refused because Gracie was in bed. Later that night, Iris is bitten when her <b>staple</b> <b>remover</b> turns into a snake; she promptly goes into the bathroom to clean up but is killed when snakes appear everywhere in the bathroom.|$|E
25|$|A <b>staple</b> <b>remover</b> {{allows for}} the quick removal of a staple from a {{material}} without causing damage. The form of destapler described was invented by William G. Pankonin of Chicago, Illinois. A patent application for the same was filed on December 12, 1932, granted on March 3, 1936, and published on April 3, 1936 as a patent.|$|E
50|$|The {{design is}} focused on {{functionality}} and robustness with no unnecessary decoration (unless one includes the ergonomics of the handle) and minimised number of parts to lower costs and production time. The device works with a pincer action to unfold and pull out a staple in one motion. The modern <b>staple</b> <b>remover</b> {{is believed to have}} been conceptualised by an Irish housewife, Meghan Rooney. However, Miss Rooney had initially intended the design to function as an implement to remove stitching and not as a <b>staple</b> <b>remover.</b> Please note: The notch on a modern-day <b>staple</b> <b>remover</b> is to remove broken staples by hooking the aforementioned broken staple into the notch and utilising the standard pincer action.|$|E

50|$|The tools {{traditionally}} {{used for}} the part preparation process are very elementary: writing utensils (pencils of various graphite hardness, colored pencils, ink pens, felt tipped pens, electric and manual erasers, correction fluid and tape), office supplies (pencil sharpeners, staplers, <b>staple</b> <b>removers,</b> scissors, rulers, drafting templates, straight-edges, non-yellowing permanent and removable adhesive tapes, paper clips, packing tape, shipping materials, and property stamps). Typical office equipment found in an ensemble library includes a high quality photocopier capable of copying and printing paper of various sizes in duplex; papers of different sizes, colors and weights; binding machines (tape, coil, wire or comb); paper cutters; and computer(s) with word processing, spreadsheet, database and music notation software.|$|R
5000|$|In 1941 {{the type}} of paper stapler {{that is the most}} common in use today was developed: the four way paper stapler. With the four way, the {{operator}} could either use the stapler to staple papers to wood or cardboard, or used to staple like pliers for bags, or the normal way with the head positioned a small distance above the stapling plate. The stapling plate is known as the anvil. The anvil often has two settings: the first, and by far most common, is the reflexive setting, also known as the [...] "primary" [...] or [...] "permanent" [...] setting. In this position the legs of the staple are folded {{toward the center of the}} cross bar. It is used to staple papers which are not expected to need separation. If rotated 180Â° or slid to its second position, the anvil will be set on the sheer setting, also known as [...] "secondary", [...] "temporary", or [...] "straight". In this position the legs of the staple are folded outwards, away from the cross bar, resulting in the legs and cross bar being in more or less a straight line. Stapling with this setting will result in more-weakly secured papers, but a staple that is much easier to remove. The use of the second setting is almost never seen, however, due to the prevalence of <b>staple</b> <b>removers</b> and the general lack of knowledge about its use. [...] Some simple modern staplers feature a fixed anvil that lacks the sheer position.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>staple</b> <b>remover</b> is {{a device}} that allows for the quick removal of a staple from a {{material}} without causing damage. The best-known form of <b>staple</b> <b>remover,</b> designed for light-gauge staples, consists essentially of a) two opposing, pivot-mounted pairs of thin, steep wedges and b) a spring that returns the device to the open position after use. Although a simple metal wedge {{can be used for}} the same purpose, and although some staplers (especially small ones about 1.5 in long) feature such a wedge at their hinge end, use of the wedge tends to tear fragile papers.|$|E
50|$|The {{torsion spring}} in this <b>staple</b> <b>remover</b> is a {{standardised}} component {{that appears in}} many other products, such as clothes pegs. It has two loops. The spring is made of chrome-plated steel, which is used {{because there is a}} point of minimum stress where continued use (opening and closing the <b>staple</b> <b>remover)</b> will not cause failure through fatigue. They are mass-produced by a spring winding machine which cold winds wire around an arbour before heat treating to make it harder. The spring is then chrome plated. The machinery to do this is large, expensive, but has a high production rate. That is why the springs are usually bought off-the-shelf from a tier 1 supplier rather than produced in house.|$|E
5000|$|Some staplers {{incorporate}} a knife, to complete excision and anastomosis {{in a single}} operation. Staplers are used to close both internal and skin wounds. Skin staples are usually applied using a disposable stapler, and removed with a specialized <b>staple</b> <b>remover.</b> Staplers are also used in vertical banded gastroplasty surgery (popularly known as [...] "stomach stapling").|$|E
50|$|She is {{extremely}} violent and nervous. She has never fired {{a single shot}} with her Makarov shotgun, but she can practically fight with anything that comes to hand. In various episodes, she has beaten opponents with a spoon, a cat food can, a <b>staple</b> <b>remover,</b> and even a corncob. She seems to favor unusual ways to make someone suffer.|$|E
50|$|As they {{explore the}} office, members of Alpha Team begin to kill their Omega Team {{counterparts}} in gruesome fashion, with Empress killing Emperor with a <b>staple</b> <b>remover,</b> Hierophant killing Judgement by hitting {{him in the}} head with a table leg with nails protruding out, and Tower stabbing High Priestess in the throat with a metal bookend. Shortly after Tower is killed by Chariot who smashes his face repeatedly with a paper shredder, and then Chariot is almost killed by Magician. Back in the surveillance room, Carl, Neil, and Susan watch the carnage between the agents. But they all learn that the system has been corrupted, and Susan realizes that the clearance codes have been switched in conjunction with the inauguration.|$|E

50|$|Where skin staples {{are used}} to seal a skin wound it will be {{necessary}} to remove the staples after an appropriate healing period, usually between 5 and 10 days, depending on the location of the wound and other factors. The skin <b>staple</b> <b>remover</b> is a small manual device which consists of a shoe or plate that is sufficiently narrow and thin to insert under the skin staple. The active part is a small blade that when hand-pressure is exerted it pushes down on the staple and pushes it through a slot in the shoe and deforms the staple into an 'M' shape to facilitate its removal, although in an emergency it is possible to remove them with a pair of artery forceps.Skin staple removers are manufactured in many shapes and forms, some disposable and some reusable.|$|E

40|$|We have {{highlighted}} this problem {{as there are}} situations where skin staples have to be removed rapidly, for example where bleeding and subsequent respiratory distress develop following neck surgery. A survey of junior hospital staff showed that many doctors had never removed skin staples nor were aware how best to remove them {{in the event of}} an emergency. Using skin simulation we compared the time to remove sutures and staples, and found it takes 55 % longer to remove skin staples. Where the standard <b>staple</b> <b>remover</b> is not immediately available, an artery forceps, correctly applied, is just as quick...|$|E
