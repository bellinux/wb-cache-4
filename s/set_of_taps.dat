Understanding the evolutionary relationships between these genes is crucial to gain insight into plant evolution. We have determined a substantial <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>TAPs</b> that are focused on, but not limited to, land plants using PSI-BLAST searches and subsequent filtering and clustering steps. Phylogenies were created in an automated way {{using a combination of}} distance and maximum likelihood methods. Comparison of the data to previously published work confirmed their accuracy and usefulness for the majority of gene families. Evidence is presented that the flowering plant apical stem cell regulator WUSCHEL evolved from an ancestral homeobox gene that was already present after the water-to-land transition. The presence of distinct expanded gene families, such as COP 1 and HIT in moss, is discussed within the evolutionary backdrop. Comparative analyses revealed that almost all angiosperm transcription factor families were already present in the earliest land plants, whereas many are missing among unicellular algae. A global analysis not only of transcription factors but also of transcriptional regulators and novel putative families is presented. A wealth of data about plant TAP families and all data accrued throughout their automated detection and analysis are made available via the PlanTAPDB Web interface.

40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{progress}} in using restricted Boltzmann machines as preprocessing algorithms for deep neural network, we revisit the mean-field equations (belief-propagation and TAP equations) {{in the best}} understood such machine, namely the Hopfield model of neural networks, and we explicit {{how they can be}} used as iterative message-passing algorithms, providing a fast method to compute the local polarizations of neurons. In the "retrieval phase" where neurons polarize in the direction of one memorized pattern, we point out a major difference between the belief propagation and TAP equations : the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> belief propagation equations depends on the pattern which is retrieved, while one can use a unique <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>TAP</b> equations. This makes the latter method much better suited for applications in the learning process of restricted Boltzmann machines. In the case where the patterns memorized in the Hopfield model are not independent, but are correlated through a combinatorial structure, we show that the TAP equations have to be modified. This modification can be seen either as an alteration of the reaction term in TAP equations, or, more interestingly, as the consequence of message passing on a graphical model with several hidden layers, where the number of hidden layers depends on the depth of the correlations in the memorized patterns. This layered structure is actually necessary when one deals with more general restricted Boltzmann machines. Comment: 29 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

Approaches to reducing environmental microbial contamination in addition to cleaning are thus worthy of consideration. Copper is well recognised as having antimicrobial activity but this property has not been applied to the clinical setting. We explored its use in a novel cross-over study on an acute medical ward. A toilet seat, <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tap</b> handles and a ward entrance door push plate each containing copper were sampled {{for the presence of}} micro-organisms and compared to equivalent standard, non-copper-containing items on the same ward. Items were sampled once weekly for 10 weeks at 07 : 00 and 17 : 00. After five weeks, the copper-containing and non-copper-containing items were interchanged. The total aerobic microbial counts per cm 2 including the presence of ‘indicator micro-organisms’ were determined. Median numbers of microorganisms harboured by the copper-containing items were between 90 % and 100 % lower than their control equivalents at both 07 : 00 and 17 : 00. This reached statistical significance for each item with one exception. Based on the median total aerobic cfu counts from the study period, five out of ten control sample points and zero out of ten copper points failed proposed benchmark values of a total aerobic count of < 5 cfu/cm 2.

This {{is a key}} step in the control of viral infections through CD 8 + T-cells. The herpes simplex virus type- 1 encodes an 88 amino acid long species-specific TAP inhibitor, ICP 47, that functions as a high affinity competitor for the peptide binding site on TAP. It has previously been suggested that the inhibitory function of ICP 47 resides within the N-terminal region (residues 1 - 35). Here we show that mutation of the highly conserved 50 PLL 52 motif within the central region of ICP 47 attenuates its inhibitory capacity. Taking advantage of the human cytomegalovirus-encoded TAP inhibitor US 6 as a luminal sensor for conformational changes <b>of</b> <b>TAP,</b> we demonstrated that the 50 PLL 52 motif is essential for freezing <b>of</b> the <b>TAP</b> conformation. Moreover, hierarchical functional interaction sites on TAP dependent on 50 PLL 52 could be defined using a comprehensive <b>set</b> <b>of</b> human-rat <b>TAP</b> chimeras.

Live/dead staining revealed that about half of the bacteria in the tap water had intact membranes. Molecular analysis using 16 S rRNA and 16 S rRNA gene-based single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) fingerprints and sequencing of drinking water bacteria before and after FACS sorting revealed: (1) the DNA- and RNA-based overall community structure differed substantially, (2) the community retrieved from RNA and DNA reflected different bacterial species, classified as 53 phylotypes (with only two common phylotypes), (3) the percentage of phylotypes with intact membranes or damaged cells were comparable for RNA- and DNA-based analyses, and (4) the retrieved species were primarily of aquatic origin. The pronounced difference between phylotypes obtained from DNA extracts (dominated by Betaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria) and from RNA extracts (dominated by Alpha-, Beta-, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria) demonstrate the relevance of concomitant RNA and DNA analyses for drinking water studies. Unexpected was that a comparable fraction (about 21 %) of phylotypes with membrane-injured cells was observed for DNA- and RNA-based analyses, contradicting the current understanding that RNA-based analyses represent the actively growing fraction of the bacterial community.

40|$|The {{life cycle}} of the {{parasite}} Plasmodium falciparum, responsible for the most deadly form of human malaria, requires specialized protein expression for survival in the mammalian host and insect vector. To identify components of processes controlling gene expression during its life cycle, the malarial genome—along with seven crown eukaryote group genomes—was queried with a reference <b>set</b> <b>of</b> transcription-associated proteins (<b>TAPs).</b> Following clustering {{on the basis of}} sequence similarity <b>of</b> the <b>TAPs</b> with their homologs, and together with hidden Markov model profile searches, 156 P. falciparum TAPs were identified.

However, in comparison with these other eukaryotic genomes, the CCCH-type zinc finger (common in proteins modulating mRNA decay and translation rates) was found to be the most abundant in the P. falciparum genome. This observation, together with the paucity of malarial transcriptional regulators identified, suggests Plasmodium protein levels are primarily determined by posttranscriptional mechanisms.

The wide availability, small size, low cost, and high robustness of MEMS-based accelerome-ters make this approach a promising near-term avenue for enabling robots to understand their physical interactions with the environment.

We then conducted controlled tapping experiments along the arm and used this dataset to develop algorithms that can determine contact information from the resulting vibration measurements.

The instruments show excellent temporal covariation and the correlation between the FMPS and ELPI is good. The advantage of the FMPS is the excellent time- and size resolution of the results. The main advantage of the ELPI is the possibility to collect size-fractionated samples of the dust for subsequent analysis by, for example, electron microscopy.
