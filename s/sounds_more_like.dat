5|$|The {{sound effects}} were {{designed}} by Star Wars veteran Ben Burtt. Whereas the phaser blast noises from the television series were derived from The War of the Worlds (1953), Burtt made his phaser <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> his blasters from Star Wars, because Abrams' depiction of phasers were closer to the blasters' bullet-like fire, rather than the steady beams of energy in previous Star Trek films. Burtt reproduced the classic photon torpedo and warp drive sounds: he tapped a long spring against a contact microphone, and combined that with cannon fire. Burtt used a 1960s oscillator to create a musical and emotional hum to the warping and transporting sounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{lyrics are}} quite personal. I like rap music, and rappers use real-life {{language}} and don’t hold back {{in what they}} talk about. My lyrics aren’t generic pop lyrics just there because they rhyme. I’ve tried to write things as I’d say them, so it <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> me. There’s a song called Sticks And Stones, which is about when I was 17 and I thought I’d won the jackpot when I got in the band , and then things not turning out as I might have expected. The middle eight on that song is very honest and truthful.|$|E

Also, William Clark and Private George Shannon {{explained}} to Nicholas Biddle (Published the first Lewis and Clark Journals in 1814) about the pronunciation of her name and how the tz <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a “j”. What better authority on the pronunciation of her name than Clark and Shannon who traveled with her and constantly heard the pronunciation of her name? We do not believe it is a Minnetaree (Hidatsa) word for her name. Sacajawea was a Lemhi Shoshone not a Hidatsa.|$|E

25|$|The {{album was}} re-released as a 2-disc 'Deluxe Edition' on 22 October 2012. The second disc {{includes}} the album re-recorded, with each song {{performed in a}} different style, including acoustic performances. It was recorded at Regal House Studio in Cambridgeshire, and produced by Lee Batiuk, with Chris Pennells and Lee Wilson involved in the recording process unlike the original release, after the band were inspired to experiment with their sound by performing at St Pancras International railway station {{as part of the}} Station Sessions. This was the same studio where the drums were recorded for the original release. Speaking about the Station Sessions performance, which was an acoustic 'stripped down' performance, James Veck-Gilodi explained; 'we thought we sounded better than we did as a rock band' and noted that 'it's nice to make music that <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the music I listen to'. The release will feature banjo, mandolin and piano.|$|E

A study estimated the chirp's total duration as 0.09 to 0.5 seconds.|$|E
500|$|Chuck Taylor of Billboard gave a {{negative}} review for the song, criticizing Madonna's rapping and calling the song [...] "a blurry snarl {{of style and}} composition that's <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a disjointed medley than a song." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian was disappointed by the lyrics saying that [...] "what on earth might her extreme point of view involve? That the world is ruled by a shadowy cabal of super-intelligent lizards?... Sadly not. Her extreme point of view {{turns out to be}} that money can't buy you happiness and that fame isn't all it's cracked up to be." [...] He also panned the lyric [...] "I like to express my extreme point of view", saying that it's difficult to hear that line without feeling a prickle of excitement.|$|E

500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a children's lullaby than a pop song. A baroque and {{psychedelic}} pop song, {{it begins with}} the sound of strings, ushering a joyous melody, with Madonna singing in a full voice. The verses are sung without any background vocals to accompany Madonna's voice. However, in the chorus, when she sings the lines, [...] "Pink elephants and lemonades, Dear Jessie hear the laughter raining on your love-parade", a different set of vocals are interwoven with hers, continuously chanting the words [...] "La-la". Synthesizer and strummed acoustics are added during the second verse, followed by the repetition of the chorus, when a change in tempo and time signature occurs, followed by the sound of a child's laughter.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Judy Coleman of The Boston Globe called [...] "Get Back" [...] a [...] "welcome girl-rock hit". Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included the song at number eight on his [...] "Top 10 from the Disney girls" [...] list, and said, [...] "She wrote {{this with the}} Jonas Brothers, but it <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a Tommy Tutone B-side from the early '80s or {{the sort of thing}} Greg Kihn was pining for when he sang, 'They don't write 'em like that anymore'". Masley noted that the song sounds better live, as does [...] "nearly everything Lovato touches". Masley concluded, writing, [...] "When she sings 'I {{want to get back to}} the old days,' what she means is when she and her boyfriend were happy, but power-pop fans will hear it as a call to get back to much older days than that." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted it as one of the best tracks on Don't Forget. Joey Guerra of The Houston Chronicle called it [...] "undeniably kicky, and Lovato manages some surprisingly credible rock wails." [...] Ken Barnes of USA Today called it an [...] "insidious, Go-Go's-like single".|$|E
500|$|According to {{the members}} of Ivy, the release {{displayed}} Durand's [...] "heavily accented" [...] vocals and Chase and Schlesinger's [...] "pop melodies and jangly guitars". As described by Ira A. Robbins, author of The Trouser Press Guide to '90 Rocks, Ivy was attempting to bring French pop music back into the American music industry. Doing so, the lyrics–particularly any adjectives used–were summarized as [...] "lifting, wispy, and shimmering" [...] by Jay Stowe, a columnist for Spin. Chase and Schlesinger solely produced the EP, while the two plus Durand handled the lyrical aspects. The record's only single, [...] "I Hate December", was released on January 12, 1996 as a remix on a CD single. However, the release was fronted by Scratchie Records instead of Seed, as the band had departed from the latter label after completing Realistic. A music video for it was produced by Doug Werby and released sometime in 1995. Schlesinger described the inspiration behind the track as being an [...] "anti-Christian single" [...] and called the remixed version [...] "groovy". [...] "I Guess I'm Just a Little Too Sensitive" [...] is of the acoustic genre and was noted by Trouser Press's Vickie Gibbons and Robbins that Durand's pronunciation of [...] "little" [...] in the track <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> [...] "lee-dull".|$|E

500|$|Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times {{praised the}} album, commenting {{that it is}} [...] "one of the year's best albums" [...] and {{describing}} it as [...] "sparser, stranger and even catchier than its predecessor". Rolling Stone magazine's Rob Sheffield, said that [...] "A Rush of Blood to the Head is a nervier, edgier, thoroughly surprising album", adding, [...] "where Parachutes was the clumsy diary of a high-strung kid, A Rush of Blood <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a band with the confidence to test its own limits." [...] Ted Kessler of NME lauded the album, calling it [...] "an album of outstanding natural beauty, an organic, wholesome work." [...] MacKenzie Wilson of AllMusic echoed the above comments, {{saying that it is}} a [...] "strong album". Wilson, who compliments Martin for his [...] "sharpened" [...] falsetto and refined [...] "haunting delivery" [...] and Buckland for his [...] "riveting guitar work", notes that [...] "regardless of the band still being in their mid-twenties, they've made an amazing record". Emma Pearse of the American newspaper The Village Voice has the same sentiments, stating that it is [...] "a little edgier, trancier, and more conversational" [...] compared to Parachutes. Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honourable mention (...) and quipped, [...] "Let Green Eyes dump him for real and we'll see how long he hums in the void." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{reviewing}} the album, Shirley Shipin of Rolling Stone opined that [...] "Breakaway" [...] was {{the highlight of}} the album where Clarkson sounded [...] "more Avril than Ashlee". Rhonda Lynn of Florida Entertainment Scene praised the acoustic guitar in the song which is instrumental in holding the whole structure together. Tammy La Gorce of Amazon.com thought that the song would not wear out due to its [...] "rock-friendly thumps, dips, and rolls." [...] In a different perspective, Joan Anderman of Boston.com remarked that [...] "Breakaway" [...] is not new or exciting-sounding but he admitted that the [...] "hit single accomplishes the rare feat of being thoroughly middle-of-the-road without sacrificing grace or intelligence". Chuck Taylor of Billboard felt that the song was a weak choice as a single compared to Clarkson's previous hits, writing Breakaway' <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an Irish folk song propped up with pop production than the anthemic material with which Clarkson has won over legions of fans." [...] Kathi Kamen Goldmark of Disney Family.com felt that the song was tedious, simultaneously dull and so emotionally overwrought that it almost sounds like a parody of itself. Michael Wood of The Village Voice described the song as [...] "a swoony acoustic folk-pop that Goo Goo Doll Johnny Rzeznik would trade his hair gel for". Jill Salama of Oprah.com listed [...] "Breakaway" [...] as one of her nine favourite Idol singles of all time, writing [...] "There is nothing that gets us more than a song about a girl going out on her own. Making a wish, making a change and, of course, breaking away. But seriously, this song {{is more than just a}} high school graduation anthem." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} by USA Today, [...] "Hello Good Morning" [...] was picked out {{as one of}} the best three songs on the Last Train to Paris. Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars in his review for the song, stating that {{although}} Dirty Money promised a new sound the song sounded like [...] "Timba–pop, albeit one with a better-than-average hook." [...] He continued, [...] "in Diddy's final-minute rap, [...] a reminder of how he jump-started his journey towards a reported $300m fortune and a butler called Fonzworth Bentley." [...] Matt from Above said it was the Danja-produced beat and the T.I. feature that make the song good. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said [...] "Diddy seems to have abandoned conventional rapping in favour of some Kanye–style automooing. He's quite good at it, too. Adds a certain nasal edge to proceedings. There's a middle bit, and it's like nothing else in the song... It <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> someone doing the [...] "I've lost my keys" [...] song, just before they leave the house in the morning. The odd thing is that it was left in there. I mean if minimal is your bag, surely that'd be the first bit to cut?" [...] He awarded in four out of five stars. Becky Bain of Idolator was also positive about the song, saying, [...] "Lyrically and stylistically, it’s a pretty standard club track—over various synth beats, the song covers the usual topics: hot girls dancing, crowds waiting to have fun, and spending time in a five star suite with some five star freaks getting high all week... But honestly, we’re just overjoyed this song isn’t just a thinly-veiled four-minute commercial for any one of Diddy’s various products." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though Chet Atkins was {{the most}} {{prominent}} guitarist to be inspired by Merle Travis, the two players' styles were significantly different. As Atkins explained, [...] "While I play alternate bass strings which <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a stride piano style, Merle played two bass strings simultaneously on the one and three beats, producing a more exciting solo rhythm, in my opinion. It was somewhat reminiscent of the great old black players." [...] The resemblance was no coincidence; Travis himself acknowledged the influence of black guitarists such as Blind Blake, the foremost ragtime and blues guitarist of the late 1920s and early 1930s.|$|E
2500|$|Rodion's verses were {{described}} as particularly eloquent in depicting the misfortune of Jewish intellectuals who sought integration into Romanian society but were still rejected—the piece is called [...] "agonizing" [...] by Zigu Ornea, and [...] "immortal" [...] by poet-essayist Radu Cosașu. However, Romanian and Israeli academic Michael Shafir noted that, with similar texts by Ronetti Roman, Steuerman-Rodion's poem mostly reflected the disbelief with which Jewish intellectuals were reacting to the late-19th-century antisemitic barrage. According to Shafir, this reaction was an undignified [...] "lament": [...] "Steuerman-Rodion [...] <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a lover rejected by his woman than a counter-combatant of the socialist persuasion".|$|E

2500|$|A son of Tushratta conspired {{with his}} subjects, and killed {{his father in}} order to become king. His brother Shattiwaza was forced to flee. In the unrest that followed, the Assyrians {{asserted}} themselves under Ashur-uballit I, and he invaded the country; and the pretender Artatama/Atratama II gained ascendancy, followed by his son Shuttarna. Suppiluliuma claims that [...] "the entire land of Mittanni went to ruin, and the land of Assyria and the land of Alshi divided it between them", but this <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> wishful thinking. Although Assyria annexed Mitanni territory, the kingdom survived. Shuttarna wisely maintained good relations with Assyria, and returned to it the palace doors of Ashur, that had been taken by Shaushtatar. Such booty formed a powerful political symbol in ancient Mesopotamia.|$|E
2500|$|Allmusic's Hal Horowitz {{found that}} by State of Emergency the group [...] "takes its Stray Cats strut and Reverend Horton Heat bluster and {{continues}} to channel it into a more commercially viable pop/punk sound ... <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a buffed up Jam album, all snappy hooks and impassioned vocals over a rollicking set of songs". Fellow Allmusic reviewer Adam Greenberg found that on White Noise the group [...] "experiments a bit with new sounds but also seems to hang {{right on the edge}} of what they had been doing previously". Dave Donnelly opined that the band [...] "have been mining the territory between pop-punk and rockabilly for well over a decade now, and their experience shines through in the slick musicianship" [...] of The Ending Is Just the Beginning Repeating.|$|E
