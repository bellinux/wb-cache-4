2500|$|Once snug and set, the hitch can be {{adjusted}} as needed. [...] To tighten the line {{with respect to a}} load attached to the <b>standing</b> <b>part,</b> the user can grasp the <b>standing</b> <b>part</b> with one hand inside of the loop and pull toward the anchor object. [...] The hitch may be grasped with the other hand and as slack develops within the loop, the hitch slid away from the anchor object, taking up the slack and enlarging the loop. [...] To loosen, the hitch may be slid toward the anchor object, making the loop smaller and lengthening the <b>standing</b> <b>part.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Dress by snugging the hitch firmly {{around the}} <b>standing</b> <b>part.</b> [...] Load slowly and adjust as necessary.|$|E
2500|$|The taut-line hitch is an {{adjustable}} loop knot {{for use on}} lines under tension. [...] It is useful when {{the length of a}} line will need to be periodically adjusted in order to maintain tension. [...] It is made by tying a rolling hitch around the <b>standing</b> <b>part</b> after passing around an anchor object. [...] Tension is maintained by sliding the hitch to adjust size of the loop, thus changing the effective length of the <b>standing</b> <b>part</b> without retying the knot.|$|E
50|$|Marienhof {{actually}} predates the {{laying out}} of Parktown as a township. It {{was constructed in}} 1890 for Edouard Lippert after he bought {{a large portion of}} Braamfontein Farm. Whilst the farmhouse is no longer <b>standing,</b> <b>parts</b> of the original stone fence and gate remain.|$|R
5000|$|To tie {{the grief}} knot, tie a single [...] "overhand knot" [...] (nb: this isn't {{the same as}} a single-strand [...] "overhand knot" [...] often used as a stopper or as a {{component}} of other knots, such as the fisherman's knot or ring water knot), as if starting a reef knot. Then thrust the two free ends together down {{through the center of the}} just-tied overhand knot. [...] Twist the free ends to form half hitches to lock, twist the other way for the granny knot-like configuration that rolls apart when the <b>standing</b> <b>parts</b> are pulled. In short, if the <b>standing</b> <b>parts</b> (the [...] "main lines" [...] which bear force into the knot) nip/cross their own ends, the knot will lock; otherwise, it will probably slip.|$|R
5000|$|The ends {{should be}} left at least 7.5 cm long and the knot should be [...] "set" [...] by {{tightening}} it with full body weight. The ends can be knotted, taped or lightly sewn to the <b>standing</b> <b>parts</b> to help prevent them from creeping back into the knot.|$|R
2500|$|Continue {{by passing}} the working end over the working part, around the <b>standing</b> <b>part</b> again and {{back through the}} loop formed in the first step. [...] Make sure this second wrap tucks in between the first wrap and the working part of the line {{on the inside of}} the loop. [...] This detail gives this version its {{additional}} security.|$|E
2500|$|The {{currently}} mothballed mid-Victorian All Souls Church by Sir George Gilbert Scott <b>standing</b> <b>part</b> way up Haley Hill to {{the north}} of the main town centre is now vested in the Historic Churches Preservation Trust. Its lofty [...] spire and white magnesian limestone exterior stand as a very personal statement in 13th century French style of the mill owner Colonel Edward Akroyd, who paid solely for its construction as the centre-piece of a purpose-built model village ("Akroydon"). All Souls' boasts an unusually complete sequence of windows by the leading artists of the 1850s, including William Wailes, John Hardman and Clayton & Bell. The large organ by Forster & Andrews inserted in 1868, ten years after the building was completed, is currently unplayable and many of its surviving parts are in storage awaiting restoration. The tower houses a ring of eight bells.|$|E

50|$|If {{the swing}} {{is to have}} two {{parallel}} ropes, the <b>standing</b> <b>parts</b> both must hang from {{the same side of}} the branch, otherwise there will be forces rotating the swing seat right and left. Swing hitch reduces such forces by having the end pull the main part towards the middle of the beam and fixing it there; Using a simple clove hitch would cause more of these disturbing rotational forces.|$|R
60|$|Bringing {{to light}} some spare coils of rope from the lockers, {{he put a}} clove-hitch on the <b>standing</b> <b>part</b> of the sea-anchor hawser, and carried the new running-line aft, making it fast to the stern bitts. Then he cast off from the forward bitts. The Dazzler swung off into the trough, {{completed}} the evolution, and pointed her nose toward shore. A couple of spare oars from below, and as many water-soaked blankets, sufficed to make a jury-mast and sail. When this was in place, Joe cast loose from the wreckage, which was now towing astern, while 'Frisco Kid took the tiller.|$|E
60|$|By {{means of}} thin {{spaces between the}} braids of matting, the place was open to the air, but not to view. There was also a round opening on one side, only large enough, however, to admit the arm; but this {{aperture}} was partially closed from within. In front, a deep-dyed rug of osiers, covering the entrance way, was intricately laced to the <b>standing</b> <b>part</b> of the tent. As I divided this lacing with my cutlass, there arose an outburst of voices from the Islanders. And they covered their faces, as the interior was revealed to my gaze.|$|E

[...] "It must be a great comfort to love and respect a mother! I've seen them, particularly young women, that I thought set quite as much store by their mothers, as they did by themselves. Well, no matter; I got into one of poor Captain Robbins's bloody currents at the first start, and have been drifting about ever since, just like the whale-boat with which we fell in, pretty much as the wind blew. They hadn't the decency to pin even a name--they might have got one out of a novel or a story-book, you know, to start a poor fellow in life with--to my shirt; no--they just set me afloat on that bit of a tombstone, and cast off the <b>standing</b> <b>part</b> of what fastened me to anything human. There they left me, to generalize on the 'arth and its ways, to my heart's content." ...|$|E

I'll draw up a paper on false heels one of these days, and send it to a private reading at the Institute. But no time for it now. My honest friend, it is now half past ten o'clock. At half past eleven the diligence starts from the Place-du-Carrousel for Calais. Make all haste till you arrive at Brentford. I have a little provender here for you to eat in the diligence, as you will not have time for a regular meal. A day-and-night courier should never be without a cracker in his pocket. You will probably leave Brentford {{in a day or two}} after your arrival there. Be wary, now, my good friend; heed well, that, if you are caught with these papers on British ground, you will involve both yourself and our Brentford friends in fatal calamities. Kick no man's box, never mind whose, in the way. Mind your own box. You can't be too cautious, but don't be too suspicious. God bless you, my honest friend. Go!" ...|$|E
60|$|We were, however, pretty long in resolving, and hankered {{about the}} Rio de la Plata a long time. At last we spied a sail to windward, {{and it was}} such a sail as I believe had not been seen {{in that part of the}} world a great while. It wanted not that we should give it chase, for it stood {{directly}} towards us, as well as they that steered could make it; and even that was more accident of weather than anything else, for if the wind had chopped about anywhere they must have gone with it. I leave any man that is a sailor, or understands anything of a ship, to judge what a figure this ship made when we first saw her, and what we could imagine was the matter with her. Her maintop-mast was come by the board about six foot above the cap, and fell forward, the head of the topgallant-mast hanging in the fore-shrouds by the stay; at the same time the parrel of the mizzen-topsail-yard by some accident giving way, the mizzen-topsail-braces (the <b>standing</b> <b>part</b> of which being fast to the main-topsail shrouds) brought the mizzen-topsail, yard and all, down with it, which spread over part of the quarter-deck like an awning; the fore-topsail was hoisted up two-thirds of the mast, but the sheets were flown; the fore-yard was lowered down upon the forecastle, the sail loose, and part of it hanging overboard. In this manner she came down upon us with the wind quartering. In a word, the figure the whole ship made was the most confounding to men that understood the sea that ever was seen. She had no boat, neither had she any colours out.|$|E

5000|$|The above {{method has}} been called by Stanle Barnes (Anglers' Knots in Gut & Nylon, 2nd ed., 1951) [...] "outcoil", and is contrasted with the method that resembles the {{finished}} knot from the start, [...] "incoil".
