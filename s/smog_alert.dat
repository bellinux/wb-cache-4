500|$|The city {{chose not}} to declare a <b>smog</b> <b>alert</b> on Thanksgiving Day, but The New York Times later {{reported}} that city officials had been [...] "on the verge" [...] of calling an alert. Austin Heller, the city's commissioner of air pollution control, said he nearly declared a first-stage alert between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. on November 24. Heller said the index had reached a high of 60.6—10 points higher than the [...] "emergency" [...] mark—between 8 and 9 p.m., and the 60.6 reading was possibly {{the highest in the}} city's history. After a nighttime lull, Heller cautioned, the smog would likely spike again in the morning.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 and 9 December 2015 Beijing had {{its first}} <b>smog</b> <b>alert</b> which {{shut down a}} {{majority}} of the industry and other commercial businesses in the city. Later in the month another smog [...] "red alert" [...] was issued.|$|E
50|$|A vehicle {{emissions}} {{testing program}} known as Ontario's Drive Clean began in 1999, {{and has had}} a minimal impact on smog in Toronto. 2005 was Toronto's worst year on record for smog {{with a total of}} 48 <b>smog</b> <b>alert</b> days. The Ontario Medical Association estimated in 2005 that total air pollution (from all sources) would cause some 5,800 deaths and 17,000 hospital admissions that year.|$|E
5000|$|The {{city has}} many {{opportunities}} for citizens to be physically active, including bike lanes, walkways, and parks throughout the city. Given the cultural diversity of the city, there is also great diversity in the foods that citizens can consume, which determines their personal nutrition. Many foods for example enter the city through the Ontario Food Terminal, located on the west side. The city {{is also part of}} the Toronto Public Health Division, and is home to many hospitals. Other factors affecting health in the city include air quality in regard to <b>smog.</b> <b>Smog</b> <b>alerts</b> are issued by Toronto Public Health when the air quality is poor enough to warrant informing some segments of the public to limit their exposure to the smog, such as children, the elderly, and people with lung diseases or heart conditions. The best and worst years for smog in the city within the last five years were respectively 2006 with 11 <b>smog</b> <b>alerts,</b> and 2005 with 48 <b>smog</b> <b>alerts.</b> Another risk to health for citizens is exposure to crime in the city. Toronto has a rate of violent crime of 738 incidents per 100,000 people, though this is still lower than the national average of 951, according to 2006 Statistics Canada data, and far lower than other cities of comparable size (particularly those in the United States). http://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/237224 ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Smog</b> <b>alerts</b> {{are issued}} by Toronto Public Health when air {{conditions}} in the city are poor enough to be harmful to a resident's health. The alerts are given {{in order to encourage}} residents to take precautions in order to protect their health, usually by limiting {{the amount of time spent}} outdoors in locations of heavy smog.|$|R
5|$|Like {{the similar}} COMPASS system on provincial freeways, RESCU {{combines}} in-pavement sensors with traffic cameras and changeable message signs (6 fixed and 10 portable) to alert drivers of accidents, traffic conditions and upcoming closures.

The message signs also frequently display non-urgent messages to motorists, such as notices for future construction, safety messages and <b>smog</b> <b>alerts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Also {{as part of}} the <b>smog</b> <b>alert</b> system put {{in place}} in the city in 2013, once a red alert is issued, a {{temporary}} driving restriction is imposed {{for the duration of the}} severe pollution event to reduce the city’s cars on the streets by half. Temporary restrictions have been implemented in Beijing twice in December 2015, and one more time in December 2016.|$|E
5000|$|As a city, Sarnia is {{committed}} to the improvement of its pollution, both air and water. The following statements from City of Sarnia Website succinctly establish this position-"As part of the City's commitment to monitoring and improving the environment, the City Council has established a number of committees to advise Council as well as appointing City representatives to outside committees who have an interest in the environment and the preservation of habitats" [...] and [...] "The City of Sarnia has adopted a <b>Smog</b> <b>Alert</b> Response Plan in support of the Ontario Government's Air Quality Ontario initiative.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} public information on avoidance behavior and health. Despite the theoretical importance of avoidance behavior, there is limited empirical evidence of its existence and how information affects such decisions. I look at the impact of “smog alerts ” on outdoor activities and hospital admissions in southern California over the period 1983 to 1998. Since <b>smog</b> <b>alerts</b> are only issued when high pollution has been predicted {{at least a day}} in advance, I identify the effects of information by comparing attendance on days when an alert was issued to days with comparable ozone levels where no alert was issued. Using daily, administrative attendance data for major facilities in southern California, the results from this analysis suggest a significant response to these alerts. However, I find little evidence that <b>smog</b> <b>alerts</b> lower the incidence of various respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions across various age groups. This is most likely {{due to the fact that}} the most susceptible population is unlikely to respond directly to an alert because there are multiple sources of information on air quality inexpensively available and because hospitalizations are an imperfect measure of health. “My throat hurt.

Short-run adjustments t o transitory risk entail costs {{that are likely to}} influence the set of evasive actions pursued by those at risk. Our results confirm that the cost of intertemporally substituting activities is increasing over time: when alerts are issued on 2 successive days, any response on the first day has largely disappeared by the second day.

50|$|Temporary driving {{restrictions}} were imposed in Beijing from December 8 to 10, 2015, {{as part of}} the smog mitigation measures provided for in Beijing’s red alert for hazardous smog, the first such alert issued ever. The <b>smog</b> <b>alert</b> system was put in place in 2013, and a red alert should go into effect if there is a prediction that the air quality index will stay over 200 for more than 72 hours. On the evening of December 7 the index was 253 according to Beijing’s authorities. Under a red alert half of the city’s cars are ordered off the streets through a temporary alternate-day travel scheme based on the cars license plate numbers. Only cars with even-numbered license plates were allowed on the roads during {{the first day of the}} restriction. Electric cars are not subject to the driving restriction, as a government incentive to promote the use of cleaner vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|Air {{pollution}} can {{be found}} throughout the city with noticeable hot spots including the Scarborough Town Centre, Highway 427 intersecting Highway 401, and the downtown area. This leaves inhabitants of these areas {{at greater risk for}} the development of respiratory issues and other health conditions. Water pollution from the city impacts the nearby environment as well. Sewage and harmful emissions have led to the presence of contaminants such as mercury, lead, and flame retardants within the waters of Lake Ontario. Recent reports indicate that harmful emissions from the city have lessened over the years as a result of local and Ontario based initiatives. In 2014, the city of Toronto celebrated going a year without a <b>smog</b> <b>alert</b> {{for the first time in}} 20 years. Improvements to air quality have been linked to the closure of coal-fired power plants and the lessened demand for electricity in the city. Initiatives such as the Toronto Environmental Alliance and Greening Greater Toronto continue to address environmental issues in the city.|$|E
40|$|This paper assesses whether {{responses}} {{to information about}} risk impact estimates {{of the relationship between}} ozone and asthma in Southern California. Using a regression discontinuity design, I find <b>smog</b> <b>alerts</b> significantly reduce daily attendance at two major outdoor facilities. Using daily time-series regression models that include year-month and small area fixed effects, I find estimates of the effect of ozone for children and the elderly that include information are significantly larger than estimates that do not. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that individuals take substantial action to reduce exposure to risk; estimates ignoring these actions are severely biased. ...|$|R

40|$|Metropolitan smog alerts are {{prominent}} public information campaigns {{designed to enhance}} public health and to curb driving and other emissions. Unlike many other voluntary information-based environmental policies, air quality alerts target household behavior via forecast information about ambient concentrations rather than firm or product characteristics. This paper explores behaviors with high emissions (driving) and with high exposure (outdoor recreation) and underscores the difference between altruistic and risk aversion motivations. Behavioral impacts are identified using the threshold nature of daily air quality forecasts. A regression discontinuity (RD) design finds elderly users and exercisers tend to curtail their use of a major park following smog alerts. The RD design also reveals that households do not drive less on <b>smog</b> <b>alert</b> days. Juxtaposing high emissions behavior with high exposure behavior in the same study highlights how public forecast information may better trigger some responses and struggle to trigger others...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of solar energy systems for many potential applications (industrial/residential heat, electricity generation by solar concentration and photovoltaics) will be critically affected by local insolation conditions. The effects of urban air pollution are considered and reviewed. A study of insolation data for Alhambra, California (9 km south of Pasadena) shows that, during a recent second-stage photochemical <b>smog</b> <b>alert</b> (greater {{than or equal to}} 0. 35 ppm ozone), the direct-beam insolation at solar noon was reduced by 40 %, and the total global by 15 %, from clean air values. Similar effects have been observed in Pasadena, and are attributable primarily to air pollution. Effects due to advecting smog have been detected 200 km away, in the Mojave Desert. Preliminary performance and economic simulations of solar thermal and photovoltaic power systems indicate increasing nonlinear sensitivity of life cycle plant cost to reductions in insolation levels due to pollution...|$|E
40|$|Results {{from the}} Dutch National Air Quality Monitoring Network (LML) show that several European air quality limit values were {{exceeded}} in the Netherlands between 2003 and 2006. This applied mainly to nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter (PM 10) and ozone. The number of exceedances was especially high in 2003, {{partly due to}} weather conditions such as enduring dry episodes. Ozone concentration levels above the alert threshold (<b>smog</b> <b>alert)</b> were measured in 2003 and 2006, with concentration levels above the alert threshold occurring mostly during heat episodes. Measurements for nitrogen dioxide showed a yearly average concentration at city street locations above the European limit value at approximately half the measuring sites between 2003 and 2006. Yearly average concentrations measured at regional locations have changed relatively little {{in the past four}} years, remaining below the limit value for this entire period. Particulate matter concentrations have been relatively constant in the past few three years, after peaking in 2003. There is an EU standard for particulate matter for short- and long-term exposure of the population, which is represented by year and day average concentrations, with a maximum number of exceedances per year allowed. The year averages for the 2003 to 2006 period are less than the standard for long-term exposure. The maximum number of days showing average concentrations above the limit value was violated at several locations in 2006. Both nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter are characterized by a clear downward trend when measured {{over a long period of}} time (15 and 14 years, respectively). However, it is not possible to determine from the past seven years whether this trend is still valid...|$|E

5000|$|The Riverside area is {{referred}} to as a [...] "smog belt" [...] because of its above-average level of air pollution.

Smog decreased considerably over the next few years as local municipalities and counties worked with the South Coast Air Quality Management District to implement measures to improve regional air quality. The <b>smog</b> <b>alerts</b> that people remember from decades ago are history. Most of Riverside's smog problems are the result of the prevailing wind patterns that blow the smog from the Los Angeles Basin and particulates generated by southern California's multitude of vehicles, and the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach into the Inland Empire.|$|R
