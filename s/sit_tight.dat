5|$|The {{breeding}} corn crake {{population had}} begun to decline in the 19th century, but the process gained pace after World War II. The main cause of the steep declines in much of Europe {{is the loss of}} nests and chicks from early mowing. Haymaking dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth, made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers, and the move from manual grass-cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers, at first horse-drawn and later pulled by tractors. Mechanisation also means that large areas can be cut quickly, leaving the crake with no alternative sites to raise either a first brood if suitable habitat has gone, or a replacement brood if the first nest is destroyed. The pattern of mowing, typically in a circular pattern from the outside of a field to its centre, gives little chance of escape for the chicks, which are also exposed to potential animal predators. Adults can often escape the mowers, although some incubating females <b>sit</b> <b>tight</b> on the nest, with fatal results.|$|E
5|$|In much of {{the western}} half of the corn crake's {{breeding}} range, there have been long-term declines {{that are expected to}} continue, although conservation measures have enabled numbers to grow in several countries, including substantial increases in the small populations in Finland, the UK and the Netherlands.

Incubation is by the female only; her tendency to <b>sit</b> <b>tight</b> when disturbed, or wait until the last moment to flee, leads to many deaths during hay-cutting and harvesting. The eggs hatch together after 19–20days, and the precocial chicks leave the nest {{within a day or}} two. They are fed by the female for three or four days, but can find their own food thereafter. The juveniles fledge after 34–38days. The second brood is started about 42 days after the first, and the incubation period is slightly shorter at 16–18days. The grown young may stay with the female until departure for Africa.|$|E

[...] Kitchener directed French to cut off the Boers' escape; of French's original strength of 5,000, only 1,200 of his cavalrymen were still fit, while the horses were depleted.

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the brooding season, the hens are very sensitive to disturbances and leave the nest quickly. Towards the end they tolerate disturbances to a certain degree, crouching on their nest which is usually hidden under low branches of a young tree or a broken tree crown. As hatching nears, hens <b>sit</b> <b>tighter</b> on the nest and will only flush from the nest if disturbed in very close proximity. Nesting hens rarely spend more than an hour a day off of the nest feeding and as such become somewhat constipated. The presence of a nest nearby is often indicated by distinctively enlarged and malformed droppings known as [...] "clocker droppings". All eggs hatch in close proximity after which the hen and clutch abandon the nest where they are at their most vulnerable. Abandoned nests often contain [...] "caeacal" [...] droppings; the discharge from the hens' appendixes built up over the incubation period.|$|R
5000|$|Early in the {{breeding}} season, {{as many as}} 11 days may transpire between {{the completion of the}} nest and the laying of the first egg. Later in the season, this time decreases so that the first egg is laid as soon as the nest is ready. [...] The female normally lays three eggs, though clutches of up to four have been recorded. The eggs, which are variously described as pale pink with evenly distributed brown spots or white with cinnamon and rust spots densely ringing the larger end of the egg, measure 16 - 17 mm by 13 mm and weigh 1 - 1.4 g. The female alone incubates the eggs for 16 days; the male does not even approach the nest until several days after the eggs hatch. She sits facing the back wall of the nest, with her head and body sheltered by its roof and her tail sticking out the opening. She <b>sits</b> <b>tight</b> at the approach of danger, typically not flying until a potential predator actually makes contact with the nest.|$|R

50|$|The female, who {{alone does}} all the {{brooding}} behavior without male help, stays at the nest 98% of the time, rarely eating and never drinking. Occasionally she stretches her legs and raises her wings overhead. The female regularly turns the eggs with her bill. The female's plumage is drab and earth-colored, which makes her well camouflaged. She occasionally picks up pieces of vegetation and drops them on her back to render her camouflage more effective. If they need to feed briefly, the females go {{to and from the}} nest with a swift, silent crouching walk. If approached the incubating bird either slips unobtrusively from the nest or <b>sits</b> <b>tight,</b> only flying off at the last moment. The incubation period is 23 to 30 days, though is not known to exceed 25 days in wild specimens. The young are precocial and very well camouflaged. The lores are tawny, the crown tawny mottled black. A broad white supercilium bordered with black meets on the nape, extending down the centre of the nape. The neck is white with irregular black stripes from behind the eye and {{from the base of the}} lower mandibles. The upper parts are tawny and black with 3 black lines running along the back. The underparts are whitish. When the chicks hatch, the mother brings them a steady stream of food, most of it soft so the chicks can eat it easily. Captive hatchlings weigh 78 to 116 g on their first day but grow quickly. The precocial chicks are able to follow their mother around several hours after hatching. After a few weeks, the young actively forage closely with their mothers. They fledge at 4 to 5 weeks old, but are not self-assured fliers until 3 to 4 months. On average, around 67% of eggs successfully hatch (testimony to the effective camouflage of nests) and around one of the two young survive to adulthood. In Namibia and Tanzania, breeding success has been found to be greatly reduced during times of drought. Most young leave their mothers in their second year of life, but do not start breeding until they are fully mature at three to four years old in both sexes in studies conducted both of wild and captive bustards. The lifespan of wild kori bustards is not known but they may live to at least 26 or possibly 28 years old in captivity.|$|R

40|$|Our paper {{describes}} the first provably-efficient algorithm for determining protein structures de novo, solely from experimental data. We {{show how the}} global nature {{of a certain kind}} of NMR data provides quantifiable complexity-theoretic benefits, allowing us to classify our algorithm as running in polynomial time. While our algorithm uses NMR data as input, it is the first polynomial-time algorithm to compute high-resolution structures de novo using any experimentally-recorded data, from either NMR spectroscopy or X-Ray crystallography. Improved algorithms for protein structure determination are needed, because currently, the process is expensive and time-consuming. For example, an area of intense research in NMR methodology is automated assignment of nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) restraints, in which structure determination <b>sits</b> in a <b>tight</b> inner-loop (cycle) of assignment/refinement. These algorithms are very time-consuming, and typically require a large cluster. Thus, algorithms for protein structure determination that are known to run in polynomial time and provide guarantees on solution accuracy are likely to have great impact in the long-term. Methods stemming from a technique called “distance geometry embedding ” do come with provable guarantees, but the NP-hardness of these problem formulations implies that in the worst case these techniques cannot run in polynomial time. We are able to avoid the NP-hardness by (a) some mild assumptions about the protein being studied, (b) the use of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) instead of a dense network of NOEs, and (c) novel algorithms and proofs that exploit the biophysical geome...|$|R
