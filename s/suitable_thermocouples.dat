40|$|During {{irradiation}} {{tests at}} high temperature, failure of commercial Inconel 600 sheathed thermocouples is commonly encountered. To understand and remediate this problem, out-ofpile tests were performed with thermocouples in carburizing atmospheres {{which can be}} assumed {{to be at least}} locally representative for High Temperature Reactors. The objective was to screen those thermocouples which would consecutively be used under irradiation. Two such screening tests have been performed with a set of thermocouples embedded in graphite (mainly conventional Type N thermocouples and thermocouples with innovative sheaths) in a dedicated furnace with helium flushing. Performance indicators such as thermal drift, insulation and loop resistance were monitored and compared to those from conventional Type N thermocouples. Several parameters were investigated: niobium sleeves, bending, thickness, sheath composition, temperature as well as the chemical environment. After the tests, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) examinations were performed to analyze possible local damage in wires and in the sheath. The present paper describes the two experiments, summarizes results and outlines further work, in particular to further analyze the findings and to select <b>suitable</b> <b>thermocouples</b> for qualification under irradiation.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} effect of a heated plume within vented enclosures. The characteristics of a heated plume within enclosures are studied using controlled and systematic experiments, simulating the movement of heated air due to the development of fire within a room. A short enclosure (Case CS 1) and a tall enclosure (Case CS 2) were subjected to two heating configurations representing natural and forced convection heat transfer. The cross-sectional dimension of the enclosures, and the heating power were maintained the same for both cases in order to compare the plume effects due to the change of height. For each case, different combinations of top ventilation were also considered for the present experiments. The air temperature and pressure within the enclosure were measured with <b>suitable</b> <b>thermocouples</b> and pressure probes, specially fabricated and mounted on racks that were positioned at three locations: (i) at 100 mm above the base of the enclosure; (ii) middle of the enclosure; and (iii) at 100 mm below the ceiling of the enclosure. The ceiling temperature profile was also obtained to determine the ceiling jet impingement. The experimental results show that for both case studies – CS 1 and CS 2, for the same heat transfer mechanism (natural or forced convection), the hot air temperature within the enclosure is decreased due to {{an increase in the number}} and size of vents. Hot air is exhausted quicker into the ambient and the exchange rate of hot air inside the enclosure and cool air from the ambient is increased. It was found that natural convection mechanism led to a higher ceiling and air temperature distribution than forced convection. The short enclosure had a higher ceiling temperature compared to the tall enclosure. Correlations for ceiling temperature distribution for short and tall enclosures are also provided. The study has resulted in obtaining valuable conclusions for the effect of a heated plume within a vented enclosure...|$|E
