Materials and techniques, different from the bipolar case, were used in order to be more compatible with the special requirements of fully passivated complementary MISFET devices. Two types of circuits were designed and fabricated, a D-flip-flop and a three-input NOR/NAND gate. Fifty beam-leaded chips of each type were constructed. A quality and reliability assurance program was performed to identify failure mechanisms. <b>Sample</b> <b>tests</b> and <b>inspections</b> (including destructive) were developed to measure the physical characteristics of the circuits...|$|R

40|$|Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) behave {{differently}} from massive <b>samples.</b> Conventional <b>testing</b> and <b>inspection</b> techniques usually fail at the microscale. Recently {{there has been}} an increasing interest in the application of optical techniques for microstructure testing, because they are high-resolution, non-contact, full-field, fast and relatively inexpensive. New interferometric systems, which are suitable for microscopic optical metrology, are of interest for engineering and industrial applications. A modified electronic speckle pattern shearing interferometer (ESPSI) with a very simple shearing device has been designed for metrology applications on the microscale. The shearing device consists of two partially reflective glass plates. The reflection coefficients of the coatings are 0. 3 and 0. 7 respectively. The distance and the tilt between the two glass plates control the size of the shear. A long working distance microscope objective is attached to the CCD camera to form a field of view variable over several millimetres in width. The suitability of the system for microscopic measurements is demonstrated. The capability of the system for phase-shifting is also demonstrated. The results obtained are promising for future applications of the ESPSI system for testing and characterisation of MEMS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This review {{presents}} a portable head instrument, using a hybrid laser generation/aircoupled detection system for ultrasonic non-destructive inspection. The equipment {{is made of}} a low-cost Nd:YAG pulsed laser linked to a multimode optic fiber to generate Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW). Instead of a long-pulse detection laser coupled to an interferometer, a small aircoupled ultrasonic transducer is used to perform the detection. A compact probe holder supporting the optical assembly and the air-coupled transducer has been designed, and integrated with an XY scanner system to move the probe above the <b>sample.</b> <b>Inspection</b> <b>tests</b> are carried-out on representative samples, and the performances of the portable head are evaluated for surface and subsurface defect detection in aeronautic composite materials. Introduction: Conventional ultrasonic techniques for Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) of materials manufactured by the aeronautic industry have traditionally relied on systems using contact piezoelectric transducers for both generation and detection. These standard inspection systems, including pulse-echo, through transmission and tandem mode require an immersion medium (usually water), or a coupling agent (gel, mineral oil…) between the sample to b...|$|R

These requirements may be set in terms of the end result required or as a detailed description of how work should be executed. Recently, there has been increasing interest in quality assurance in the construction industry. Quality assurance includes design and planning, <b>sampling,</b> <b>inspection,</b> <b>testing,</b> and assessment to ensure that end products perform according to specifications. This research proposes a new quality assessment model for highway steel bridges and more specifically for coating rust assessment. The research proposes a hybrid model using image processing and neural networks for defect recognition and measurement. The basic concept of the model is to acquire digital images of the areas to be assessed and analyze those images to recognize and measure defect patterns. Neural networks are incorporated into the model to learn from example and simulate human expertise to automate the process for future use. The model is supplemented with a statistical quality assessment plan to use the model efficiently and obtain consistent and reliable results. The statistical plan will determine the number and locations of assessment images to be taken. Moreover, the plan will address the risks associated with the estimated assessment. Finally, the plan will assist making the final acceptance/rejection decision based on the predefined criteria for acceptance and rejection...|$|R
