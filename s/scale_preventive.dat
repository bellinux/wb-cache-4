Focus groups and individual interviews of 128 caregivers were conducted in eight of the selected villages. On average, 24. 7 % of households reported any sharing of RUSF within the household. Sharing practices outside the household remained rare. Most of the sharing reported occurred among children under 5 years of age living in the household. On average, 91 % of caregivers in all districts rated the child's appreciation of the products as good or very good.

Although full integration of all elements of mapping, monitoring, and surveillance strategies might not be feasible for the diseases targeted through the preventive chemotherapy approach, there are opportunities for integration, and we present examples of integrated strategies. Finally, if advantage is to be taken of scaled up interventions to address neglected tropical diseases, efforts to develop rapid, inexpensive, and easy-to-use methods, whether disease-specific or integrated, should be increased.

Numerous factors interlinked to cause DFL which starts as ulcer & end up as amputation. Apart from the direct effect on individuals it has indirect impact on society in terms of decreased productivity. Large <b>scale</b> <b>preventive</b> programs targeting predicting factors of DFL are needed to minimize its burden. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate multiple predicting factors of DFL on poor, limited resources community to aid in fighting this disease. Materials & Methods: This is an analytical case control study conducted in Jabir Abu Alaiz diabetic centre in Khartoum Sudan in june & july 2014. 88 adult DFL patients were enrolled as cases & 182 adult diabetic patients were enrolled as controls. Data were collected on DM duration, glycaemic control, neuropathy, vasculopathy, retinopathy, feet deformity, history of ulcers among demographic & other variables. Frequency matching was done on design stage. Bivariate & multivariate analysis were conducted for multiple possible predicting factors. Results: Recurrent ulcers (OR 3. 525 95 % CI (1. 66 - 7. 48) p-value (0. 001)), & feet deformity (OR 3. 186 95 % CI (1. 6 - 6. 3) p-value (0. 001)) proved to be statistically significant predicting variables. Suboptimal foot care clinics visits & diabetic foot wear was observed. Conclusion: Recurrent ulcers & feet deformity are predicting factors to DFL among others.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Low-grade chronic {{inflammation}} is {{one potential}} mechanism underlying the well-established association between {{major depressive disorder}} (MDD) and increased cardiovascular morbidity. Both aspirin and statins have anti-inflammatory properties, which may contribute to their preventive effect on cardiovascular diseases. Previous studies on the potentially preventive effect of these drugs on depression have provided inconsistent results. The aim of the present paper {{was to assess the}} prospective association between regular aspirin or statin use and the incidence of MDD. METHOD: This prospective cohort study included 1631 subjects (43. 6 % women, mean age 51. 7 years), randomly selected from the general population of an urban area. Subjects underwent a thorough physical evaluation as well as semi-structured interviews investigating DSM-IV mental disorders at baseline and follow-up (mean duration 5. 2 years). Analyses were adjusted for a wide array of potential confounders. RESULTS: Our main finding was that regular aspirin or statin use at baseline did not reduce the incidence of MDD during follow-up, regardless of sex or age (hazard ratios, aspirin: 1. 19; 95 %CI, 0. 68 - 2. 08; and statins: 1. 25; 95 %CI, 0. 73 - 2. 14; respectively). LIMITATIONS: Our study is not a randomized clinical trial and could not adjust for all potential confounding factors, information on aspirin or statin use was collected only for the 6 months prior to the evaluations, and the sample was restricted to subjects between 35 and 66 years of age. CONCLUSION: Our data do not support a large <b>scale</b> <b>preventive</b> treatment of depression using aspirin or statins in subjects aged from 35 to 66 years from the community...|$|E

40|$|Migration, be it {{voluntary}} or forced, {{can have}} multiple {{consequences for the}} {{mental and physical health}} of the individuals concerned. In addition, {{it is not uncommon for}} these consequences to be passed on from one generation to the other. In this thesis we described how migration can influence mental health, health-related quality of life and help-seeking in childhood. We confirm the findings of previous research by showing that disparities between migrants and non-migrants in mental health and health-related quality of life exist, even in the preschool years. It is of importance to address these disparities early in life to prevent them from getting larger. Qualitative research allowed us to explore more profoundly perceptions of mental health help-seeking among adolescent girls and mothers with different ethnic backgrounds. Barriers were identified in both Dutch and non-Dutch focus group discussions which shows that access to mental health services by youth in need should be reassessed and improved. <b>Scaling</b> up <b>preventive</b> and treatment programs in schools may be a first step. In ethnic minority groups, additional efforts should be made to reduce the stigmas and taboos associated with mental health problems. In conclusion, this thesis underlines the important influence migration can have on health, even in early life.

A fifteen item closed ended questionnaire was prepared, which had information regarding the Chief complaint along with Age, Gender, Socioeconomic Status, intervals of dental visits and frequency of brushing. Kuppuswamy's socioeconomic classification, which includes monthly income, education level and occupation, was used to classify the socioeconomic status (SES) of the patients. RESULTS:There was no statistically significant difference reported between various levels of education, socio-economic status and gender when correlated with the frequency of dental visits. However, the results show that with increase in the level of education and socio-economic status the frequency of tooth brushing was positively correlated.

This research investigates {{the relationship of}} non-risk Turkish early adolescent urban middle school students’ need satisfaction, coping, mindfulness and awareness of consequences of online behaviours with problematic Internet use (PIU), {{and the effectiveness of}} a small <b>scale</b> <b>preventive</b> program on PIU in two studies. Study 1 examined the extent to which coping strategies in stressful situations and mindfulness during online engagement mediates the relationship between need satisfaction in real life and PIU, and the reliability of measures to assess coping, mindfulness, online persona, PIU and need satisfaction. A cross-sectional design and Path analysis on a sample of 165 Turkish early adolescents (Mage = 12. 88, SD =. 83; 49. 1 % females) found that need satisfaction was negatively related to PIU via low avoidant coping and high mindfulness in Internet engagement. Study 2 designed, implemented and tested the effectiveness in preventing PIU through a 10 -week Mindful and Need-supportive Digital Life Responsibility Program (MiNDLifeResP) based on mindfulness in online engagement, awareness of responsible Internet use, satisfaction of psychological needs, and comprehensive understanding of active coping strategies. A quasi-experimental design collected both quantitative and qualitative data from twenty experimental group students (9 females) and twenty control group students (8 females). In pre-test, post-test and follow up, PIU, responsible Internet use, coping strategies, and psychological needs, plus frequencies and limitations in Internet use, were assessed. Post intervention interviews sought experimental group students’ experience and perceptions of the implemented program. The experimental group and researcher kept diaries during the intervention, and parents reported on their children’s Internet use behaviour in pre- and post-tests. For pre-test, post-test and follow-up descriptive statistics and bi-variate correlations were calculated, along with MANOVA for gender differences. In addition, a two-way repeated measures ANOVA and a cross tabulation analysis was used in the main analysis, a one-way repeated measure ANOVA for students’ quantitative diaries, and a paired-sample t-test to compare parents’ reports about their children’s time spent on Internet. An independent sample t-test compared students’ perception of need satisfaction in quantitative diaries. Content analysis was performed on experimental group students’ qualitative interview data, and on the researcher’s reflection diary. The MiNDLifeResP was unsuccessful in increasing RIU and decreasing PIU and avoidant coping for not-at-risk adolescents, but successful in forming positive cognitions for students regarding harmonious Internet use, active coping, and awareness of the present moment. Additionally, the need supportive component was successful for students’ need satisfaction during the intervention. Recommendations to improve the study and implications of the results for education and teaching practices are then discussed. by Jale Ataşalar. Ph. D...|$|E

Patients' knowledge on kidney stones and its recurrence prevention {{is an important factor in}} preventive behaviors of kidney stone recurrence. This study aimed to determinine the preventive behaviors of kidney stone recurrence on it and its relation to knowledge on it and also knowledge on it receiving resources. Methods: This descriptive- analytical study was performed as cross-sectional. The sample size consisted of 210 persons who had referred to 3 care centers in Yazd. Data Collection instrument was a questionnaire that had two parts: the first part was demographic information and the second part was <b>scales</b> for <b>preventive</b> behavior of kidney stones recurrence, knowledge aassessment and cues to action which were completed with interview. Data were analyzed with T-test, ANOVA, χ 2 and correlation coefficient test thnough spss 16. Results: Mean score of recurrence preventive behaviors was 38. 75 ± 7. 85 from 70 the Mean score on knowledge was 9. 49 ± 7. 85 from 25 and Mean score of cues to action was 2. 67 ± 1. 78 from 8. The lowest reported recurrence preventive behavior was consulting with a registered dietitian or specialist about consumption of fruits and vegetables. The lowest reported knowledge was about dairy consumption in individuals with a history of kidney stone (21. 4 %), and the highest reported cues to action was other kidney stone patients (54. 3 %). Pearson correlation showed a positive correlation between preventive behaviors, knowledge and cues to action (P< 0. 05).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Interest {{is growing}} in {{predictive}} risk mapping for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), particularly to <b>scale</b> up <b>preventive</b> chemotherapy, surveillance, and elimination efforts. Soil-transmitted helminths (hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Trichuris trichiura) are the most widespread NTDs, but broad geographical analyses are scarce. We aimed to predict the spatial and temporal distribution of soil-transmitted helminth infections, including the number of infected people and treatment needs, across sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and African Journal Online from inception to Dec 31, 2013, without language restrictions, to identify georeferenced surveys. We extracted data from household surveys on sources of drinking water, sanitation, and women's level of education. Bayesian geostatistical models were used to align the data in space and estimate risk of with hookworm, A lumbricoides, and T trichiura over a grid of roughly 1 million pixels at a spatial resolution of 5 ?×? 5 km. We calculated anthelmintic treatment needs {{on the basis of}} WHO guidelines (treatment of all school-aged children once per year where prevalence in this population is 20 - 50 % or twice per year if prevalence is greater than 50 %). FINDINGS: We identified 459 relevant survey reports that referenced 6040 unique locations. We estimate that the prevalence of hookworm, A lumbricoides, and T trichiura among school-aged children from 2000 onwards was 16 · 5 %, 6 · 6 %, and 4 · 4 %. These estimates are between 52 % and 74 % lower than those in surveys done before 2000, and have become similar to values for the entire communities. We estimated that 126 million doses of anthelmintic treatments are required per year. INTERPRETATION: Patterns of soil-transmitted helminth infection in sub-Saharan Africa have changed and the prevalence of infection has declined substantially in this millennium, probably due to socioeconomic development and large-scale deworming programmes. The global control strategy should be reassessed, with emphasis given also to adults to progress towards local elimination.

40|$|The HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has reached}} historical heights. The number of infected people {{has been rising}} constantly and the HIV crisis has been spreading {{to more and more}} countries. Testimony to this is the higher number of infected people. Unless wide <b>scale</b> comprehensive <b>preventive,</b> care and treatment measures are taken, the epidemic will claim more and more lives. Its legal, social and economic impacts are numerous in the field of health, in education, agriculture, human resources, etc. The rights of people who are infected are regularly violated. Those who live with the disease are victims of violence and they, consequently, bear the mark of a situation of acute precariousness. From the time the epidemic was discovered, people living with HIV/AIDS, face various levels of stigmatization and hidden discrimination which are tantamount to violence. They have faced exclusion in schools, in the work place and elsewhere. Furthermore, people who are marginalized due to their HIV status eventually become the group that is most vulnerable and most exposed to risks of contamination by HIV. Women are a special target because they have faced several types of marginalization such as poverty, cultural status, high levels of illiteracy, a general low level of education, informal and irregular jobs, etc. Ignorance of the way transmission occurs sustains irrational fears of contamination, bringing about prejudices. Discrimination and stigmatization of people living with HIV/AIDS and their companions reduce the efficiency of programs aimed at prevention, treatment and care. The purpose of the study is to show that fundamental human rights commit States to take legal and regulatory measures aimed at eliminating all forms of discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS and other vulnerable groups, in order to safeguard all their fundamental liberties.

40|$|Abstract Background Reducing {{the disease}} burden of major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) is of major public health relevance. The prevention of depression is regarded as one possible approach to reach this goal. People with multiple risk factors for MDD such as chronic back pain and subthreshold depressive symptoms may benefit most from preventive measures. The Internet as intervention setting allows for <b>scaling</b> up <b>preventive</b> interventions on a public mental health level. Methods This study is a multicenter pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) of parallel design aiming to investigate the (cost-) effectiveness of an Internet- and mobile-based intervention (IMI) {{for the prevention of}} depression in chronic back pain patients (PROD-BP) with subthreshold depressive symptoms. eSano BackCare-DP is a guided, chronic back pain-specific depression prevention intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles comprising six weekly plus three optional modules and two booster sessions after completion of the intervention. Trained psychologists provide guidance by sending feedback messages after each module. A total of 406 patients with chronic back pain and without a depressive disorder at baseline will be recruited following orthopedic rehabilitation care and allocated to either intervention or treatment-as-usual (TAU). Primary patient-relevant endpoint of the trial is the time to onset of MDD measured by the telephone-administered Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID) at baseline and 1 -year post-randomization. Key secondary outcomes are health-related quality of life, depression severity, pain intensity, pain-related disability, ability to work, intervention satisfaction and adherence as well as side effects of the intervention. Online assessments take place at baseline and 90 weeks as well as 6 and 120 months post-randomization. Cox regression survival analysis will be conducted to estimate hazard ratio at 12 -month follow-up. Moreover, an economic analysis will be conducted from a societal and public health perspective. Discussion This is the first study examining an IMI for depression prevention in a sample of chronic pain patients. If this implementation of a depression prevention IMI into orthopedic aftercare proves effective, the intervention could be integrated into routine care with minimal costs and extended for use with other chronic diseases.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine factors {{associated}} with returning for second round mammography screening. SETTING: This was a population based mammographic screening programme in Melbourne, Australia. DESIGN: A cohort design was used whereby 668 women were interviewed before the screening programme began and attendance for both first and second round screening was ascertained from programme records. The cohort sample was drawn from two regions of a defined area (close to and distant from the screening centre). MAIN RESULTS: Of the 315 women who attended for first round screening, 75 % from the proximal sample and 70 % from the distal sample returned for second round screening. Attendance at the second round was predicted by the following: the method of recruitment for first round screening, with women who required a letter of invitation and a reminder being less likely to reattend than those who initially attended {{in response to a}} community campaign (OR = 0. 34; CI 0. 19, 0. 61); mammographic history before the initial screen, with women who reported previous diagnostic mammography being more likely to reattend {{than those who did not}} (OR = 2. 97; CI 1. 01, 8. 9); stated intention of attending for the initial screen, with those with weakest intention of attending for their first round being less likely to attend for second round (OR = 0. 44; CI 0. 23, 0. 85); and increasing scores on a <b>scale</b> that measured <b>preventive</b> orientation to health (OR = 1. 24; CI 1. 02, 1. 50).

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Food and Nutrition Bulletin [© 2014 United Nations University Press] and The Journal's website is at: [URL] To achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, particularly reduction in child mortality (Millennium Development Goal 4), effective interventions to address severe and moderate acute malnutrition (SAM and MAM) among children under 5 years of age must be implemented and brought to <b>scale</b> alongside <b>preventive</b> measures. Bangladesh has an estimated 600, 000 children with SAM, for a prevalence of 4 %, while 1. 8 million children suffer from MAM. Objective. To assess the feasibility and constraints of community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM), a relatively new approach, in managing SAM and MAM among children in Bangladesh. Methods. The methodology involved desk reviews of documents by searching through PubMed and other databases for published literature on CMAM in Bangladesh. We also did a hand search of policy and program documents, including the draft National Nutrition Policy 2013; the Health, Nutrition, Population Sector Development Program document of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Bangladesh; the Sixth Five Year Plan; and the Operational Plans of the National Nutrition Services of Bangladesh. Results. The conventional approach in Bangladesh has been to treat children suffering from SAM and associated complications in hospital settings. There is no program to take care of children with MAM. There is a dearth of local evidence to operationalize and implement CMAM in the context of Bangladesh. This paper summarizes the scientific literature and rationale for the implementation of CMAM in Bangladesh. It also provides recommendations to improve health strategies related to CMAM, discusses diets being developed that may result in better implementation of CMAM, and offers recommendations for areas of additional necessary research. Conclusions. A recommended approach for Bangladesh on the management of acute malnutrition would be to integrate CMAM into the rollout of the National Nutrition Services so that screening, identification, referral, and treatment of acutely malnourished children could be effectively managed within the community-based health service delivery system. Given {{that the vast majority of}} children are suffering from MAM and could be treated with locally developed food supplements, a significant emphasis of the CMAM approach in Bangladesh should be to screen and treat MAM. Over time, this would also result in fewer SAM cases. However, even with this approach, there would still be a small number of children who have SAM and who ideally should be treated with specialized therapeutic foods. While the Government of Bangladesh is awaiting full-scale production of a local ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF), an interim strategy is needed to effectively treat these severely wasted children on an outpatient basis.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} on the causation of child abuse, {{and many of these}} theories assign some role to stress. Stress is variously conceptualized as a continuous state resulting from poverty, poor housing, and the like, or as an immediate crisis such as an argument or the breakdown of an appliance. An alternate perspective on stress identifies it with life change events which require readjustment in the lifestyle of a person. When an excessive number or magnitude of such life change events occur, the person affected may be said to be in a state of life crisis. Such states of life crisis {{have been found to be}} associated with the onset of physical illness and with the occurrence of accidents and injuries. In this study, a questionnaire was administered to 35 abusing parents and 35 matched controls who had experienced problems with their children but had not been abusive. The two groups were compared for their life change scores on the Social Readjustment Rating Scale for the year before their abuse or problems began with their children. The mean score of the nonabusers was 124, which does not indicate a life crisis. For the abusers, the mean score was 234, which indicates a moderate life crisis. These means are significantly different at the. 001 level by the t test. The role of symbiosis, an emotiontional attachment in which a person seeks to be taken care of by another person, was also explored. It is argued that abusive parents are competing with each other and with their children for the role of being cared for. This kind of behavior seems to make the person particularly vulnerable to life changes, which in turn produce stress. Support for this view was found in the responses to the questionnaire. Prevention strategies aimed at reducing change and stress might include better provision of crisis-intervention services, measures aimed at reducing unemployment or lack of opportunity, effective health maintenance services, and greater provision of counseling and mental health services. Use of the Social Readjustment Rating <b>Scale</b> in a <b>preventive</b> program of early intervention is also possible...|$|R

Many scientific contributions have been developed regarding metallic alloys corrosion performance in nitrate salts at laboratory scale. Accordingly, lack of technical background is identified about nitrates corrosion in relevant operation conditions. Therefore, a corrosion testing device (CTD) was designed to evaluate corrosion behavior of structural materials inside high temperature nitrate salts storage tanks in operation. Furthermore, A 516 Gr 70 carbon steel was evaluated at different exposures times by using the CTD in the TES-PS 10 pilot plant. Results reported within this study show the feasibility of the CTD to be used at commercial <b>scale</b> allowing corrosion <b>preventive</b> maintenance practices and materials selection optimization. Moreover, A 516 Gr 70 carbon steel displayed an excellent corrosion performance after nitrate salts exposure being recommended for long time service under continuous and intermittent exposure to nitrate salts. In addition to low corrosion rates, carbon steel generated protective and well adhered iron oxide layers without significant localized phenomena. Finally, negligible susceptibility to crevice and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) phenomena is showed by carbon steel under test conditions.

40|$|Globally malaria {{still remains}} the most {{important}} parasitic disease of public health interest. In the recent past, most endemic countries have deployed and <b>scaled</b> up both <b>preventive</b> and curative interventions to reduce malaria transmission and, ideally, eliminate it. This has lead to global reductions in both mortality and incidence of malaria. These declines {{have been attributed to}} the reinvigoration of the global malaria control agenda by the explicit ambition of achieving elimination, which has lead to an increase in funding for national control programmes to increase coverage of preventive interventions, field compatible diagnostic tools for confirming parasite infection, and increased access to effective treatment. As a result of declines in malaria transmission, the focal nature of malaria transmission has become much more evident and has lead to consideration of surveillance as a key intervention for malaria control/elimination in its own right. Surveillance systems have been well established in most formal health facilities but the incorporation of these systems at community level and operationalised by community health workers (CHWs) still remains limited. Additionally, these few examples of CHW-implemented surveillance systems have been typically only reporting indicators of malaria infection burden, without capturing indicators of intervention availability, deployment, coverage and utilisation, thus representing a missed opportunity for routine monitoring and evaluation of impact of interventions in “real time” to inform program planning and implementation. The study was established as part of a multi-country study under the Malaria Transmission Consortium Project whose primary objective was to develop and evaluate new or improved methods for measuring malaria transmission. Thus the overall goal {{of this study was to}} demonstrate how malaria transmission, and impact of interventions, could be routinely measured through a novel longitudinal community based surveillance system (CBSS) operationalised by modestly paid CHWs. The CBSS included both passive and active surveillance activities using field – compatible test kits for in situ parasitological detection of malaria infections, based on which confirmed cases were treated with anti-malarial drugs, coupled with a detailed questionnaire on access and use of malaria control interventions and population characteristics. Passive surveillance was achieved conventionally whenever community members self-reported to the CHWs and active surveillance was achieved through monthly active visits to all households in their catchment populations to offer testing and treatment. In addition to recording detailed details of each patient contact in a paper patient register, weekly summaries of selected data elements were submitted by the CHWs using a mobile phone platform via short messaging system (SMS). The detailed reference data recorded in the patient register was then used to monitor malaria infection dynamics in the study population, evaluate the impact of preventative measures, such as indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and validate the electronic summaries submitted via SMS. Overall, the CBSS did not routinely capture all malaria infections in the study population and was insufficient to eliminate the human parasite reservoir. This was primarily due to limited study participant participation with the monthly active testing and treatment offered by the CHWs. However, the CBSS clearly demonstrated the incremental and residual impact to supplementation of pyrethroid-treated LLINs with non - pyrethroid insecticides applied by IRS in areas where the dominant malaria vector is highly resistant to pyrethroids. The adequacy of the SMS reports submitted by the CHWs confirms the great potential of mobile phone technology for facilitating and improving the effectiveness of community based reporting. Despite its limitations, the CBSS successfully provided programmatically relevant information regarding malaria infection dynamics across the large study area at a very affordable cost. The CHWs demonstrated their ability to not only provide treatment services but also adequately report their findings both electronically and on paper. CHWs are primarily tasked with providing routine health services at community level but clearly also have a valuable auxiliary role to play in “real time” surveillance of malaria, and most probably a range of other diseases. If the full potential of CHWs as agents of health surveillance can be realized, control programme progress can be measured through spatial and temporal mapping of transmission with greater sensitivity and at finer scales than is possible with health facilities alone, to enable improved, better-informed program planning, resource allocation and implementation...|$|R
