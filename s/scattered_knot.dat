60|$|Tavernake {{passed through}} the <b>scattered</b> <b>knot</b> of loiterers {{at the door and}} bought a seat for himself in the little music-hall, which, {{notwithstanding}} the professor's boast, was none too well filled. It was a place of the old-fashioned sort, with small tables in the front, and waiters hurrying about serving drinks. The people were of the lowest order, and the atmosphere of the room was thick with tobacco smoke. A young woman in a flaxen wig and boy's clothes was singing a popular ditty, marching up and down the stage, and interspersing the words o f her song with grimaces and appropriate action. Tavernake sat down with a barely-smothered groan. He was beginning to realize the tragedy upon which he had stumbled. A comic singer followed, who in a dress suit several sizes too large for him gave an imitation of a popular Irish comedian. Then the curtain went up and the professor was seen, {{standing in front of the}} curtain and bowing solemnly to a somewhat unresponsive audience. A minute later Beatrice came quietly in and sat by his side. There was nothing new about the show. Tavernake had seen the same thing before, with the exception that the professor was perhaps a little behind the majority of his fellow-craftsmen. The performance was finished in dead silence, and after it was over, Beatrice came to the front and sang. She was a very unusual figure in such a place, in a plain black evening gown, with black gloves and no jewelry, but they encored her heartily, and she sang a song from the musical comedy in which Tavernake had first seen her. A sudden wave of reminiscence stirred within him. His thoughts seemed to go back to the night when he had waited for her outside the theatre and they had had supper at Imano's, to the day when he had left the boarding-house and entered upon his new life. It was more like a dream than ever now.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha! {{this may}} save us {{a visit to}} Brixton Road," [...] whispered Holmes. [...] "Come with me, {{and we will see}} what is to be made of this fellow." [...] Striding through the <b>scattered</b> <b>knots</b> of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my {{companion}} speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.|$|R
6000|$|Through these <b>scattered</b> <b>knots</b> of {{horsemen}} Chandos rode, {{and as many}} of {{them were}} old antagonists it was [...] "Ha, John!" [...] on the one side, and [...] "Ha, Raoul!" [...] "Ha, Nicholas!" [...] "Ha, Guichard!" [...] upon the other, as they brushed past them. Only one cavalier greeted them amiss, a large, red-faced man, the Lord Clermont, who by some strange chance bore upon his surcoat a blue virgin standing amid golden sunbeams, which was the very device which Chandos had donned for the day. The fiery Frenchman dashed across their path and drew his steed back on to its haunches.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{the sounds}} grew fainter, and the lads {{judged by the}} {{direction}} that the Russian column was falling back in retreat. Ere long the sounds of firing ceased altogether, and in <b>scattered</b> <b>knots</b> of three and four, men came through the wood to the wide open space in which the midshipmen were lying bound. No {{attention was paid to}} them for some time, until a large body of men were collected. Then the lads were suddenly raised and carried to a large fire which was now-blazing in the centre of the clearing. Here the gags were taken from their mouths, and the cords unbound, and they saw confronting them a young man evidently by his dress and bearing a person of rank and authority, and, as they judged by the attitude of those standing round, the leader of the insurgent band.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there were}} shouts {{that the police}} were charging. A number of mounted men trotted into the square. The crowd began a series of short rushes that opened lanes for the passage of the mounted police as they rode to and fro. These men trotted through the crowd, <b>scattering</b> <b>knots</b> of people. They carried pick-handles, but they {{did not seem to be}} hitting with them. It became clear that they aimed at the capture of the trolley. There was only a feeble {{struggle}} for the trolley; it was captured and hauled through the scattered spectators in the square to the protection of a small impassive body of regular cavalry at the opposite corner. Then quite a number of people seemed to be getting excited and fighting. They appeared to be vaguely fighting the foot-police, and the police seemed to be vaguely pushing through them and dispersing them. The roof of a little one-story shop became prominent as a centre of vigorous stone-throwing.|$|R
6000|$|Charles Gould turned {{towards the}} town. Before him the jagged {{peaks of the}} Sierra came out all black in the clear dawn. Here and there a muffled lepero whisked round {{the corner of a}} grass-grown street before the ringing hoofs of his horse. Dogs barked behind the walls of the gardens; and with the {{colourless}} light the chill of the snows seemed to fall from the mountains upon the disjointed pavements and the shuttered houses with broken cornices and the plaster peeling in patches between the flat pilasters of the fronts. The daybreak struggled with the gloom under the arcades on the Plaza, with no signs of country people disposing their goods for the day's market, piles of fruit, bundles of vegetables ornamented with flowers, on low benches under enormous mat umbrellas; with no cheery early morning bustle of villagers, women, children, and loaded donkeys. Only a few <b>scattered</b> <b>knots</b> of revolutionists stood in the vast space, all looking one way from under their slouched hats for some sign of news from Rincon. The largest of those groups turned about like one man as Charles Gould passed, and shouted, [...] "Viva la libertad!" [...] after him in a menacing tone.|$|R
60|$|During {{all this}} time the roaring of those guns had been {{something}} dreadful to listen to, but now they suddenly died away, though {{it was like the}} lull in a thunderstorm when one feels that a worse crash is coming hard at the fringe of it. There was still a mighty noise on the distant wing, where the Prussians were pushing their way onwards, but that was two miles away. The other batteries, both French and English, were silent, and the smoke cleared so that the armies could see a little of each other. It was a dreary sight along our ridge, for there seemed to be just a few <b>scattered</b> <b>knots</b> of red and the lines of green where the German Legion stood, while the masses of the French appeared to be as thick as ever, though of course we knew that they must have lost many thousands in these attacks. We heard a great cheering and shouting from among them, and then suddenly all their batteries opened together with a roar which made the din of the earlier part seem nothing in comparison. It might well be twice as loud, for every battery was twice as near, being moved right up to point blank range, with huge masses of horse between and behind them to guard them from attack.|$|R
50|$|Because the {{collisions}} between {{billiard balls}} are nearly elastic, and the balls roll on a surface that produces low rolling friction, their behavior {{is often used}} to illustrate Newton's laws of motion. Idealized, frictionless billiard balls are a staple of mathematical theorems and physics models, and figure in dynamical billiards, <b>scattering</b> theory, Lissajous <b>knots,</b> billiard ball computing and reversible cellular automata, Polchinski's paradox, contact dynamics, collision detection, the illumination problem, atomic ultracooling, quantum mirages and elsewhere in these fields.|$|R
40|$|Simple physics {{ideas are}} used to derive an exact {{expression}} for a flat connection on the complement of a torus knot. The result is of some mathematical importance {{in the context of}} constructing representations of the knot group [...] a topological invariant of the knot. It is also a step forward in the direction of obtaining a generalisation of the Aharonov-Bohm effect, in which charged particles moving through force-free regions are <b>scattered</b> by impenetrable, <b>knotted</b> solenoids.

60|$|For {{several minutes}} Guert and I watched our enemy {{while he was}} thus employed, for the Huron was obliged {{to proceed with the}} utmost caution, lest a light prematurely shed around should betray him. He {{cautiously}} lighted his knots quite within the pile, having left a place for that purpose; and his combustibles were well in flames before the latter began to throw their rays to any distance. We had a quantity of water provided in the room from which we beheld all these movements, and might at any time have extinguished the fire, by pouring a stream through our loop, provided we did not wait too long. But Guert objected to 'spoiling the sport,' as he called it, insisting that the logs of the house would be slow to ignite, and that we might at any moment <b>scatter</b> the <b>knots,</b> by a rapid sortie. His wish was to let the enemy proceed in his designs, as far as would be at all safe, in order to render his defeat more overwhelming.|$|R
40|$|We present deep spectroscopic and imaging data of {{the host}} galaxies of Mrk 1014, IRAS 07598 + 6508, and Mrk 231. These objects form part of both the QSO and the ultraluminous {{infrared}} galaxy #ULIG# families, and may represent a transition stage in an evolutionary scenario. Our imaging shows that all three objects have highly perturbed hosts with tidal tails and destroyed disks, and {{appear to be in}} the #nal stages of major mergers. The host galaxies of the three objects have spectra typical of E+A galaxies, showing simultaneously features from an old and a young stellar component. We model spectra from di#erent regions of the host galaxies using Bruzual & Charlot # 1996 # spectral synthesis models using two component models including an old underlying population and recent superposed starbursts. Mrk 1014 has intense star formation concentrated in a large knot # 2 kpc from the nucleus, along {{the leading edge of the}} tidal tail, and in several <b>knots</b> <b>scattered</b> around the host.

40|$|Original article can {{be found}} via: [URL] Copyright Royal Astronomical Society [Full text {{of this article is}} not {{available}} in the UHRA]We present near-infrared polarization images of the nuclear region of NGC 1068. For the first time, extended reflection nebulosity from the south-western cone, which is obscured at optical wavelengths, is detected. Polarized flux images show the region of enhanced <b>scattering,</b> or polarized <b>knot,</b> ~ 4. 5 arcsec north-east of the nucleus. Our photometry of the nucleus shows an increase in luminosity compared with earlier observations, which is consistent with the brightening recently reported by Glass. We have successfully adapted the nuclear aperture model of Young et al. to fit the polarized flux images. We find that the basic geometrical parameters of inclination (43 deg), position angle (PA, 34 deg) and opening half-angle (40 deg) of the scattering cones are entirely consistent with our earlier model, with the north-eastern cone having the same PA as the large-scale radio structure. However, an inner scattering cone of inclination 34 deg, PA 10 deg and opening half-angle of 15 deg is required to fit the observed polarized flux distribution to the north-east of the nucleus. This inner cone has the same PA as that of the small-scale (subarcsec) radio jet between sources S and C, implying that source S is the radio source closest to the central engine. Such a cone to the south-west of the nucleus is presumably obscured by the torus...|$|R
40|$|Sternum closure after open {{heart surgery}} is {{typically}} done with steel wires. Final approximation of sternal parts and connection {{is achieved by}} twisting {{the ends of the}} wire and bending the twisted assembly towards the sternum in order to minimize outward protrusion. Though this routine procedure is highly effective, some failures do occur, e. g. due to wire fracture. Fatigue fracture of the wires, e. g. due to coughing implies a failure risk. An alternative development is to make cables from gel spun Ultra High Molecular Weight Poly Ethylene (UHMWPE) fibres, such fibres are extremely strong, yet flexible, and if made as a very pure grade, they are highly bio compatible. The optimal connection technique will be different from that of steel. Connection will rather be with knotting than twisting. A new sternum closure and fixation technique has been developed for the sternum. Additionally, a testing technique was developed, for a connec-tion of simulated sternum parts, using different materials according to their respective optimal connection method and subsequently testing the mechanical properties of the connection. Substantial differences were observed. The mechani-cal behaviour of twisted steel wire connection showed more <b>scatter</b> than the <b>knotted</b> UHMWPE cables and some initial slack was sometimes present in the twisted cables. The maximum attainable force in the steel wires was determined by “untwisting ” due to the external load. The maximum force in the UHMWPE cables was determined by the knot strength...|$|R
60|$|It was {{our first}} answer to the fire which the guns of the {{fortress}} had kept up, and was greeted with a general cheer. As rocket after rocket rushed out in rapid succession, the natives paused for a minute, astonished at these novel missiles, and then, their chiefs urging them forward, they again advanced. They were now not more than five hundred yards from ourselves, a hundred {{from the edge of}} the little ravine up the side of which the skirmishers of the 4th were rapidly climbing. With my glass I could distinguish every feature, and as we looked at them coming forward at a run, with their bright-coloured floating robes, their animated gestures, their shields and spears, one could not help feeling pity for them, ruffians and cut-throats as most of them undoubtedly were, to think what a terrible reception they were about to meet with. In another minute the line of skirmishers had breasted the slope, and opened a tremendous fire with their Sniders upon the enemy. The latter, taken completely by surprise, paused, discharged their firearms, and then retreated, slowly and doggedly, but increasing in speed as they felt how hopeless was the struggle against antagonists who could pour in ten shots to their one. Indeed, at this point they were outnumbered even by the 4th alone, for they were in no regular order, but in groups and <b>knots</b> <b>scattered</b> over the whole plain. The 4th advanced rapidly, driving their antagonists before them, and followed by the native regiments. So fast was the advance that numbers of the enemy could not regain the road to the fortress, but were driven away to the right, off the plateau, on to the side of a ravine, from which the rockets again drove them, still further to the right, and away from Magdala. The 4th and other regiments formed up at a few hundred yards from the foot of the ascent to the fortress, and for half-an-hour maintained an animated fire against the riflemen who lined the path, and kept up a brisk return from small rifle-pits and the shelter of stones and rocks. All this time the guns upon Fahla and some of those upon Salamgi, kept up a constant fire upon an advancing line; but the aim was very bad, and most of the shot went over our heads. Much more alarming were our own rockets, some of which came in very unpleasant proximity to us. Presently, to our great relief, the sailors joined us, and soon drove the enemy’s riflemen up the hill, after which they threw a few salvos of rockets with admirable aim up at the guns a thousand feet above us, doing, as it afterwards turned out, considerable damage, and nearly killing Theodore himself, who was superintending the working of the gun by his German prisoners. In the mean time a much more serious contest was taking place upon our left. The main body of the enemy had taken this direction to attack the baggage, and advanced directly towards the Punjaub Pioneers, who were defending the head of the road. Fortunately Colonel Penn’s mountain train of steel guns, which were following the naval train, now arrived at the top of the road, instantly unloaded, and took their places by the side of the Punjaubees. When the enemy were within three hundred yards the steel guns opened with shell, the Punjaubees poured in their fire and speedily stopped the advance of the head of the column. The greater part of the natives then went down the ravine to the left, along which they proceeded to the attack of the baggage, in the main valley of which this ravine was a branch. The baggage-guard, composed of a detachment of the 4th, scattered along the long line, had already been warned by the guns of the fortress that an attack was impending, and Captain Aberdie, of the transport train, gallopping down, brought them word of the advancing body of the enemy. The various officers upon duty instantly collected their men. Captain Roberts was in command, and was well seconded by Lieutenants Irving, Sweeny, and Durrant of the 4th, and by the officers of the transport train.|$|R
