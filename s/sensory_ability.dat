50|$|The lateral line is {{a system}} of sense organs found in aquatic vertebrates, used to detect movement, vibration, and {{pressure}} gradients in the surrounding water. The <b>sensory</b> <b>ability</b> is achieved via modified epithelial cells, known as hair cells, which respond to displacement caused by motion and transduce these signals into electrical impulses via excitatory synapses. Lateral lines serve {{an important role in}} schooling behavior, predation, and orientation. For example, fish can use their lateral line system to follow the vortices produced by fleeing prey. Lateral lines are usually visible as faint lines of pores running lengthwise down each side, from the vicinity of the gill covers {{to the base of the}} tail. In some species, the receptive organs of the lateral line have been modified to function as electroreceptors, which are organs used to detect electrical impulses, and as such, these systems remain closely linked. Most amphibian larvae and some fully aquatic adult amphibians possess mechanosensitive systems comparable to the lateral line.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: A key {{question}} in gerontological research concerns whether good functioning {{can be maintained}} in some cognitive abilities in old age, even if deficits occur in other cognitive or <b>sensory</b> <b>abilities.</b> Our goals were to investigate relations of cognitive and <b>sensory</b> <b>abilities</b> in old age, whether these relations differed in size across old age, and whether this was affected by general cognitive ability (processing speed), educational level, and/or general health status. Methods: Two thousand eight hundred and twelve older adults (aged 65 - 101, M = 77. 9 years) from the Vivre-Leben-Vivere survey served as cross-sectional sample for the present study. We administered psychometric tests on processing speed (the speed of cognitive processing), cognitive flexibility (the ability to alternate between cognitive operations), and verbal abilities (vocabulary). In addition, we interviewed individuals on their hearing, eyesight, educational level, and general health status. We regressed sizes of relations between abilities (calculated within each 1 - year age tranche) on mean age within the corresponding age tranche, {{with the number of}} participants within the corresponding age tranche as case weights. Results: We observed a decrease in relations between processing speed and cognitive flexibility in old age that was particularly pronounced in individuals with high educational level (r = -. 41). In contrast, we did not find differences in relations between other cognitive and <b>sensory</b> <b>abilities</b> across old age, which held for different levels of general cognitive ability, education, and general health status. Conclusion: Present data do not support the view of a generally increased relation of cognitive and <b>sensory</b> <b>abilities</b> in old age...|$|R

40|$|Emergent pattern {{formation}} in self-propelled particle (SPP) systems is extensively studied because it addresses {{a range of}} swarming phenomena which occur without leadership. Here we present a dynamic SPP model in which a sensory blind zone is introduced into each particle's zone of interaction. Using numerical simulations we discovered that the degradation of milling patterns with increasing blind zone ranges undergoes two distinct transitions, including a new, spatially nonhomogeneous transition that involves cessation of particles' motion caused by broken symmetries in their interaction fields. Our results also show the necessity of nearly complete panoramic <b>sensory</b> <b>ability</b> for milling behavior to emerge in dynamic SPP models, suggesting a possible relationship between collective behavior and sensory systems of biological organisms.

40|$|Magnetoreception is an enigmatic, poorly {{understood}} <b>sensory</b> <b>ability,</b> described {{mainly on the}} basis of behavioural studies in animals of diverse taxa. Recently, corpuscles containing superparamagnetic iron-storage protein ferritin were found in the inner ear hair cells of birds, a predominantly single ferritin corpuscle per cell. It was suggested that these corpuscles might represent magnetosomes and function as magnetosensors. Here we determine ferritin low-field paramagnetic susceptibility to estimate its magnetically induced intracellular behaviour. Physical simulations show that ferritin corpuscles cannot be deformed or rotate in weak geomagnetic fields, and thus cannot provide magnetoreception via deformation of the cuticular plate. Furthermore, we reached an alternative hypothesis that ferritin corpuscle in avian ears may function as an intracellular electromagnetic oscillator. Such an oscillator would generate additional cellular electric potential related to normal cell conditions. Though the phenomenon seems to be weak, this effect deserves further analyses.
