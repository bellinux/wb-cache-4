5|$|Batman Forever {{went through}} a few major edits before its release.

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the Eighth National Congress, held in September 1956, Peng attended a Politburo committee to redraft the new Party Constitution. At this meeting, Peng suggested that a <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Constitution's preamble referring to Mao Zedong Thought be removed. Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, Peng Zhen, and most other senior CCP members present quickly agreed, and it {{was removed from the}} final version of the 1956 Party Constitution. At the Congress, Peng was re-appointed to the Politburo and as a full member of the Central Committee.|$|E
5|$|M-91 {{was formed}} when M-66 was rerouted in the 1940s. At the time, the highway {{continued}} south to Lowell, but subsequent transfers or roadway sections have truncated {{the route to}} its present form. For a time period in the 1980s, M-91 was even a discontinuous highway when a <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle was transferred to county control before the southernmost section was transferred.|$|E

5|$|SR78 {{was one of}} the {{original}} state highways designated in 1934, although portions of the route existed as early as 1900. However, it was not designated east of Brawley until 1959. The freeway <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North County of San Diego that connects Oceanside and Escondido was built {{in the middle of the}} twentieth century in several stages, including a transitory stage known as the Vista Way Freeway, and has been improved several times. An expressway bypass of the city of Brawley was completed in 2012. There are many projects slated to improve the freeway due to increasing congestion in the region.|$|E

According to the early Colonial Kaqchikel {{document}} Memorial de Sololá, the last two of these were not very important.

5|$|Ødegaard {{spent his}} first years in the local sports club Drammen Strong. His father, Hans Erik Ødegaard, a former {{football}}er, co-founded a football <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> club, and became the coach of his son's team. In 2005, when Ødegaard was six, his parents and others each invested 50,000 kroner so that the local club could refit their gravel field, Kjappen, with artificial turf. This has been cited as crucial for his development, as Ødegaard spent countless hours on the field.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{the roadway}} loops around itself at a <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> roadway locally known as The Helix, {{descending}} the New Jersey Palisades {{to reach the}} entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel under the Hudson River. The route has a westbound exit for CR677 (John F. Kennedy/Hudson Boulevard East) and another exit for Boulevard East with a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. After interchanging with Boulevard East, the road features an eastbound toll plaza and enters the Lincoln Tunnel. At the New York state line, which is located at the midpoint of the Hudson River, the road continues as NY 495, which is separate from I-495, and heads into Midtown Manhattan in New York City.|$|E

5|$|Below {{these are}} the members of UK Headquarters, {{including}} the association's Chief Scout, who is honorary head of the association and its public face, and the UK Chief Commissioner, {{who is in charge}} of the volunteers in the association and of the other commissioners. Below {{these are the}} commissioners for the nations, regions, counties, areas and districts, all of whom are assisted by deputies and assistant commissioners who can oversee and advise on a particular area of responsibility – for example an assistant district commissioner for Beaver Scouts particularly ensures that that <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> district is abiding to the association's rules. The final managerial role in the association is that of the Group Scout Leader and their assistant, who are both in charge of a local Scout group. All of these roles are uniformed and for those volunteer roles from County level downwards training is required in the basic values of the association, safety and child protection, inclusion and advanced managerial skills to achieve their Wood Badge.|$|E
5|$|Casey {{returned}} to Washington, D.C. in October 1940 to become {{chief of the}} Design and Engineering <b>Section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Construction Division of the Office of the Quartermaster General, under Brigadier General Brehon B. Somervell. An enormous construction program was underway {{to meet the needs}} of World War II. Working with a staff that included George Bergstrom, a former president of the American Institute of Architects, Casey set about revising the standard designs for barracks. A number of new features were added to improve comfort, safety, and durability. Substitutions were made for scarce materials. It was discovered that the standard 63-man barracks was now too small. Of the 81 companies in the new triangular division, 51 fitted more easily into 74-man barracks. By slightly increasing the barracks size, substantial savings were made by reducing the overall number of buildings that needed to be constructed, the size of the cantonment areas required, and the length of required roads and utility lines. Casey was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 8 April 1941.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, plans {{had existed}} for an {{extensive}} rapid transit system, with an underground <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city center. Inspired by the successful Oslo Metro that had opened in 1966, similar plans were developed. The proposed network {{was close to}} the current long-term plans for the light rail system, and consisted of three branches from the city center to Flaktveit, Olsvik and the airport. Four-car trains would operate at ten-minute headways. The suggestion was discussed by the city council in 1973, but no decision was taken. As an alternative, expansion of the railway from Bergen to Eidsvåg, Åsane and Nesttun was proposed. Fast commuter trains could then be supplemented with buses.|$|E
