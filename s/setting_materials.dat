50|$|Casting is a {{manufacturing}} {{process in which}} a liquid material is usually poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. The solidified part {{is also known as}} a casting, which is ejected or broken out of the mold to complete the process. Casting materials are usually metals or various cold <b>setting</b> <b>materials</b> that cure after mixing two or more components together; examples are epoxy, concrete, plaster and clay.

50|$|It is {{important}} that the wet areas of a bathroom be waterproof, and multiple layers of waterproofing can be employed. Grout is used to fill gaps between tiles, but grout and tile <b>setting</b> <b>materials</b> are generally porous. Tiles are generally waterproof, though a shower pan must be installed beneath them as a safety to prevent water leakage. Thus small mosaic tiles offer less of a defense than large format tiles. Sub-tile waterproofing {{is important}} when tiles are being used. Best practice requires a waterproofing material to cover the walls and floor of the shower area that are then covered with tile, or in some countries with a sheet material like vinyl.|$|E
