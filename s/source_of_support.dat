5|$|Revolution {{broke out}} in St. Petersburg {{in the spring of}} 1917. At the height of the chaos, Maria and her {{siblings}} were stricken with measles. The Tsarina was reluctant to move the children to the safety of the imperial residence at Gatchina, even though she was advised to do so. Maria was the last of the five to fall ill and, while she was still healthy, was a major <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> to her mother. Maria went outside with her mother on the night of March 13, 1917 to plead with the soldiers to remain loyal to the imperial family. Shortly afterwards, the seventeen-year-old fell ill with measles and virulent pneumonia and nearly died. She was not told that her father had abdicated the throne until after she began to recover.|$|E
5|$|The {{logistics}} of the referendum were organised and supervised by Diệm's brother and confidant, Nhu, {{who was the}} leader of the family's secret Cần Lao party, which supplied the Ngôs' electoral base. Reports of violence and intimidation were widespread. During the referendum, Nhu's staff told voters to throw away the green ballots. Those who disobeyed were often chased down and beaten, with pepper sauce and water sometimes being forced into their nostrils. The violations were particularly flagrant in central Vietnam, a region over which another of Diệm's younger brothers, Ngô Đình Cẩn, ruled. Cẩn was based in the former imperial capital city of Huế, home of the Nguyễn Dynasty and a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for Bảo Đại. He stifled this support by ordering the police to arrest 1,200 people for political reasons in the week leading up to the vote. In the city of Hội An, several people were killed in election violence {{on the day of the}} poll. Voting started at 07:00 and ended at 17:00.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Optimism and <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> {{have been}} {{constantly}} related to {{quality of life}} and psychological well-being. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the role <b>of</b> optimism, <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> and age as predictors of quality of life in cancer patients and survivors. Method: Fifty-five participants (F= 44, M = 11) were inclusive of the study, with ages that ranged from 18 - 87 years, (M = 39. 1 SD = 18. 97). Four questionnaires were used to measure each variable. Quality of Life was measured by McGill’s Quality of Life Questionnaire short form, optimism was measured using the Life Orientation Test Revised, <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> was measured by Sarason’s <b>Sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>Support</b> Questionnaire and depression and anxiety was calculated by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: The results were evaluated by a hierarchal regression. Optimism was a greater predictor of quality of life solitary from <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> <b>Sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> had a marginal significant implication in increasing cancer patient’s quality of life when introduced as a mediator into the model. Age had no significant increase in quality of life. Conclusion: Optimism was supported as an effective method of increasing psychological well-being and quality <b>of</b> life. <b>Sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> on the other hand had a marginal significance in the second model to the increase of quality of life in cancer patients when introduced with optimism. Age had no increase in quality of life when added to the model with <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> and optimism...|$|R

5|$|The {{early history}} of British {{expansion}} in India was characterised by the co-existence of two approaches towards the existing princely states. The first was a policy of annexation, where the British sought to forcibly absorb the Indian princely states into the provinces which constituted their Empire in India. The second was a policy of indirect rule, where the British assumed suzerainty and paramountcy over princely states, but conceded to them sovereignty and varying degrees of internal self-government. During {{the early part of}} the 19th century, the policy of the British tended towards annexation, but the Indian Rebellion of 1857 forced a change in this approach, by demonstrating both the difficulty of absorbing and subduing annexed states, and the usefulness of princely states as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> In 1858, the policy of annexation was formally renounced, and British relations with the remaining princely states thereafter were based on subsidiary alliances, whereby the British exercised paramountcy over all princely states, with the British crown as ultimate suzerain, but at the same time respected and protected them as allies, taking control of their external relations. The exact relations between the British and each princely state were regulated by individual treaties and varied widely, with some states having complete internal self-government, others being subject to significant control in their internal affairs, and some rulers being in effect little more than the owners of landed estates, with little autonomy.|$|E

This study examined the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> and quality <b>of</b> life of 50 grandmother-headed families. Comparative analyses revealed that there were significant differences between grandmothers raising grandchildren with and without disabilities in regard to <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> and family quality <b>of</b> life. Informal <b>support</b> was significantly higher for grandmothers raising grandchildren without disabilities. In addition, grandmothers raising grandchildren without disabilities rated satisfaction with all aspects of family quality of life except parenting as significantly higher than grandmothers raising grandchildren with disabilities. Correlational analyses showed a moderate correlation between <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> and family quality of life for both groups of grandmothers. While total informal social support was significantly correlated with satisfaction ratings of family quality of life for both groups of grandmothers, total formal support was significantly correlated with satisfaction ratings of family quality of life only for grandmothers raising grandchildren with disabilities. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that there was a significant relationship between presence ofchild disability and satisfaction ratings of family quality of life.

In the late 1970s the state spent $3 million restoring the colonnade's crumbling foundation; more recently, it spent another $200,000 to restore the 98 bronze busts, many of which had deteriorated badly.

25|$|Following the February Revolution, a Special Transcaucasian Committee, {{including}} Armenian, Azerbaijani and Georgian representatives, {{was established}} to administer parts of the South Caucasus {{under the control of}} the Russian Provisional Government. After the October Revolution, on 11 November 1917, this committee was replaced by the Transcaucasian Commissariat, also known as the Sejm, with headquarters in Tiflis. The Sejm opposed Bolshevism and sought separation of the South Caucasus from Bolshevik Russia. To prevent that, on 13 November 1917, a group of Bolsheviks and Left Socialist-Revolutionaries (SR) proclaimed the Baku Soviet, a governing body which assumed power over the territory of Baku Governorate under the leadership of Bolshevik Stepan Shahumyan. Although the Baku Soviet included Azerbaijanis and Armenians who were neither Bolsheviks nor necessarily sympathetic towards Bolshevik ideas, the two nationalist parties and members of the Sejm ― the Musavat and Armenian Revolutionary Federation ― refused to recognize its authority. The Baku-based Musavat dominated the Muslim National Councils (MNCs), a representative body which eventually formed the first Parliament of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR). Mammad Hasan Hajinski chaired the Temporary Executive Committee for the MNCs, while Mammed Amin Rasulzade, Alimardan Topchubashev, Fatali Khan Khoyski and other prominent political figures were among the 44 Azerbaijani delegates to the Sejm. Meanwhile, the ARF, which was established in Tiflis, formed a 27-member Armenian delegation to the Sejm. The leader of the Baku Soviet, Shahumyan, kept contacts with ARF and viewed it as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for eliminating Musavat influence in Baku. It is noteworthy that during the March Days of 1918, one of the ARF founders, Stepan Zorian, was present in Baku.|$|E
