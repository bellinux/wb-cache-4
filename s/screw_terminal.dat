The distribution unit contains a controller, I/O units and DIN rails for holding AC and DC distribution MCBs, battery connections and battery MCBs, as well as <b>screw</b> <b>terminal</b> sockets for AC input and DC bus connections.|$|E
5000|$|When {{properly}} tightened, {{the connections}} are physically and electrically secure because they firmly contact a large section of wire. The terminals are relatively low cost {{compared with other}} types of connector, and a <b>screw</b> <b>terminal</b> can easily be integrated into the design of a building wiring device (such as a socket, switch, or lamp holder).|$|E
50|$|However, {{with the}} {{clamping}} plate type of <b>screw</b> <b>terminal</b> {{this time is}} reduced, since it is necessary only to insert the stripped wire between the terminal and the rear clamping plate then tighten the connection, using the screw to clamp the wire between the terminal and the clamping plate, without any need properly to wrap it around the screw head.|$|E
50|$|The screw {{mechanism}} limits the minimum physical {{size of a}} <b>terminal,</b> making <b>screw</b> <b>terminals</b> less useful where very many connections are required.|$|R
50|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>terminals</b> {{are low in}} cost when {{compared}} to other types of connectors, and can be readily designed into products for circuits carrying currents of from a fraction of an ampere up to several hundred amperes at low to moderate frequencies. The terminals easily can be re-used in the field, allowing for the replacement of wires or equipment, generally with standard hand tools. <b>Screw</b> <b>terminals</b> usually avoid the requirement for a specialized mating connector to be applied to the ends of wires.|$|R

50|$|While wires may be crimped, {{they should}} not be heavily tinned with solder prior to {{installation}} in a <b>screw</b> <b>terminal,</b> since the soft metal will cold flow, resulting in a loose connection and possible fire hazard. Screw connectors sometimes come loose if not done up tightly enough at fitting time. Verifying adequate tightening torque requires calibrated installation tools and proper training. In the UK, all screw connectors on fixed mains installations are required to be accessible for servicing, for this reason.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} rebuilt in the 1950s. In 1954, a new factory was {{completed}} in Inselstrasse in Stuttgart-Untertürkheim. Founded in Malters, Switzerland, in 1957, SEFAG was the first branch outside Germany. The company began using plastics on an industrial scale in 1962 with the new plant in Winterbach. In 1968, Pfisterer invented the compact <b>screw</b> <b>terminal,</b> which became the technical standard used to connect all new builds in Germany to underground power networks {{from the end of}} the 1960s. The following year, Pfisterer received the patent for compact fuse disconnector strips for low-voltage distributors and used them in plastic distributing cabinets, a new development at the time.|$|E
5000|$|Assembly of a screw {{connection}} requires some care in workmanship to ensure proper removal of insulation, containment of all wire strands, and the adequate tightening of the screw. If the wire diameter is small {{in relation to}} the size of the screw, the wire may be cut through by the over-tightening of the screw. This is less likely to occur when a wire is clamped between two plates by the action of a screw. Since wire strands may not be contained by the screw head in a basic <b>screw</b> <b>terminal,</b> stranded wires may be crimped into a ferrule to prevent the bridging of terminals; this partly offsets the economy of a [...] "bare" [...] wire termination.|$|E

KEMET was granted a record number of 20 U.S. patents in fiscal year 2015.|$|E
50|$|Junctions {{should be}} made in a {{reliable}} manner, {{but there are many}} possible approaches to accomplish this.For low temperatures, junctions can be brazed or soldered, however {{it may be difficult to}} find a suitable flux and this may not be suitable at the sensing junction due to the solder's low melting point.Reference and extension junctions are therefore usually made with <b>screw</b> <b>terminal</b> blocks.For high temperatures, a common approach is a spot weld or crimp using a durable material.A common myth regarding thermocouples is that junctions must be made cleanly without involving a third metal, to avoid unwanted added emfs.This may result from another common misunderstanding that the voltage is generated at the junction. In fact, the junctions should in principle have uniform internal temperature, therefore no voltage is generated at the junction. The voltage is generated in the thermal gradient, along the wire.|$|E
