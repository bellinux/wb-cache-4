40|$|SummaryBackgroundThis study {{aimed to}} assess the impact of leak {{compensation}} capabilities during pressure- and volume-limited non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) in COPD patients. MethodsFourteen patients with stable hypercapnic COPD who were receiving long-term NPPV were included in the study. For both modes of NPPV, a full face mask and an artificial leak in the ventilatory circuit were used at three different settings, and applied during daytime NPPV, either without leakage (setting I), with leakage during inspiration only (<b>setting</b> <b>II),</b> and with leakage during inspiration and expiration (setting III). Ventilation pattern was pneumotachygraphically recorded. ResultsNPPV was feasible with negligible leak volumes, indicating optimal mask fitting during the daytime (setting I). In the presence of leakage (settings II and III), the attempt to compensate for leak was only evident during pressure-limited NPPV, since inspiratory volumes delivered by the ventilator increased from 726 ± 129 (setting I) to 1104 ± 164 (<b>setting</b> <b>II),</b> and to 1257 ± 166 (setting III) ml during pressure-limited NPPV, respectively (all p< 0. 001); however, they remained stable during volume-limited NPPV. Leak compensation resulted in a decrease in leakage-induced dyspnea. However, 83 %/ 87 % (setting II/III) of the additionally-delivered inspiratory volume during pressure-limited NPPV was also lost via leakage. Expiratory volume was higher in <b>setting</b> <b>II</b> compared to <b>setting</b> III (both p< 0. 001), indicating the presence of significant expiratory leakage. ConclusionsThe attempt at leak compensation largely feeds the leakage itself and only results in a marginal increase of tidal volume. However, pressure-limited – but not volume-limited – NPPV results in a clinically-important leak compensation in vivo.

30|$|However, {{in setting}} III of the simulation, where all correct {{clusters}} have {{equal number of}} locations, the switching cost dominates the variances of the total search time (see Section C of Additional file  2). A team would probably collect all ten correct locations from {{a small number of}} sources. Therefore, the highly exploitative ϵ-greedy strategy and its variants outperform the IntEstim strategy by switching less. Given that the highly exploitative ϵ-greedy strategy and its variants achieve overall promising performance in <b>setting</b> <b>II</b> and III, they should also be adopted in a more general social search problem with unknown rewards distribution.|$|R
