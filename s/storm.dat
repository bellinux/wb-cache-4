5|$|A {{circulation}} {{began to}} form on June 18 {{in the eastern}} Gulf of Mexico, prompting gale warnings. It was declared Subtropical Depression One the same day. The depression made landfall {{on the morning of}} June 18 just north of Spring Hill, Florida and gained subtropical <b>storm</b> status over land. The <b>storm</b> was classified as Subtropical <b>Storm</b> One by the National Hurricane Center, as the rule was not to name subtropical storms. The subtropical <b>storm</b> moved to the northeast and crossed the Outer Banks of North Carolina on June 19. Even though the minimum central pressures remained low, the circulation expanded and became distorted. The subtropical <b>storm</b> peaked at 70mph winds (110km/h) on June 18, but did not reach its minimum pressure until June 20, when it dropped to 984mbar (29.07inHg). The subtropical <b>storm</b> was declared an extratropical <b>storm</b> near the Canadian Maritimes the same day.|$|E
5|$|A {{depression}} {{formed on}} October 18 {{in the central}} Bay of Bengal {{and moved to the}} north.

The <b>storm</b> became the second severe cyclonic <b>storm</b> of the season the following day, and turned onto a more northerly track towards the Ganges Delta. The <b>storm</b> peaked with winds of 130km/h (80mph) before it made landfall near the West Bengal-East Pakistan border during the morning of October 23. The <b>storm</b> then crossed over East Pakistan, before dissipating over southern Assam on October 24.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area formed along a dissipating cold front {{to the north of}} Puerto Rico. The system moved westward, developing some tropical characteristics by October13. The next day, the system became a tropical <b>storm</b> over the Straits of Florida. On October15, it crossed over South Florida near Homestead with winds of 60mph (95km/h). The <b>storm</b> was never fully tropical, as its winds and precipitation extended far away from the center. The <b>storm</b> intensified further over the Florida peninsula, peaking at 65mph (100km/h) early on October16. After affecting Florida, the <b>storm</b> crossed the western Atlantic and moved across the Outer Banks. The <b>storm</b> became extratropical on October17, and the next day it was absorbed by another extratropical <b>storm.</b>|$|E

Severe {{geomagnetic}} <b>storms</b> {{are observed}} {{to be the}} largest 2 % of all large geomagnetic <b>storms.</b> Here great geomagnetic <b>storms</b> with Dst magnitude <- 200 nT are considered. In this paper all severe geomagnetic <b>storms</b> have been selected which have occurred during year 1996 to 2005. We have found 16 severe geomagnetic <b>storms</b> during this period. These <b>storms</b> are significant {{not only because of the}} extremely high magnetic activity but also due to their great impact on the geomagnetosphere. The relationship of severe geomagnetic <b>storms</b> with different interplanetary parameters and their solar source origin are presented. We have found that 95 % severe geomagnetic <b>storms</b> are associated with halo coronal mass ejections...|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{developed into}} a tropical depression near Tobago on August7. The system then passed through the Windward Islands just south of Carriacou and Petite Martinique. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea early on August8, the tropical depression strengthened into a tropical <b>storm.</b> On August9, the <b>storm</b> strengthened to {{the equivalent of a}} Category1 hurricane, while positioned south of Dominican Republic. The next day, the hurricane peaked with winds of 90mph (150km/h). After striking the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti, the cyclone began weakening and fell to tropical <b>storm</b> intensity on August12. By midday on the following day, the <b>storm</b> made landfall near Cienfuegos, Cuba. Upon emerging into the Straits of Florida, the <b>storm</b> began to re-strengthen. Early on August13, it struck Big Pine Key, Florida, as a strong tropical <b>storm.</b> Weakening slowly while moving north-northwestward, the system made another landfall near St. George Island. After moving inland, the tropical <b>storm</b> slowly deteriorated, falling to tropical depression intensity on August15 and dissipating over West Virginia on August17.|$|E
5|$|A weak trough {{existed in}} the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September29. A {{circulation}} developed within the <b>storm,</b> becoming a tropical depression on October1. Later that day, the system intensified into Tropical <b>Storm</b> How. Initially, the tropical <b>storm</b> moved west-northwestward and its sustained winds peaked by October2, estimated at 45mph (75km/h). Officials advised small boats to remain at port along the Louisiana coast due to the <b>storm.</b> On October3, Tropical <b>Storm</b> How turned toward the southwest as it began weakening, {{and the next day}} it moved ashore near La Pesca, Tamaulipas as a tropical depression.

5|$|About 19hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{issued a}} {{tropical}} <b>storm</b> warning from Apalachicola to Venice, Florida, which {{was preceded by}} a tropical <b>storm</b> watch six hours prior. As the <b>storm</b> intensified further, the NHC issued a hurricane warning from Apalachicola to Anclote Key, and extended the tropical <b>storm</b> warning westward to Fort Walton Beach. The agency later issued a tropical <b>storm</b> warning for the Atlantic coast from Cape Canaveral to Little River Inlet in South Carolina. Officials ordered evacuations for barrier islands in nine Florida counties along the gulf coast, and about 3,000people stayed in shelters. Government offices closed along the storm's projected path in the state. Later, the <b>storm</b> forced the cancellation of part of Bob Dole's bus tour through New York, and postponed {{a search for the}} wreck of TWA Flight 800.

5|$|After peaking in intensity, the <b>storm</b> began {{weakening}} due {{to increasing}} easterly wind shear from the ridge to the north, displacing {{the center of}} circulation from the deepest convection. Early on May14, the IMD downgraded the <b>storm</b> to a severe cyclonic <b>storm.</b> Around this time, steering currents slackened, and the cyclone meandered northward over the central Bay of Bengal. By late on May14, convection had largely dissipated, {{with the exception of}} a small area near the center, and the system weakened to minimal cyclonic <b>storm</b> status. Thunderstorm activity continued to wax and wane as the <b>storm</b> turned to the southeastward, though persistent hostile conditions caused the <b>storm</b> to weaken further to a deep depression on May16. As the nearby ridge translated eastward, the depression was able to move more steadily to the east and later to the northeast, passing northwest of the Andaman Islands on May18. On the next day, the deep depression re-intensified into a cyclonic <b>storm,</b> reaching a secondary peak with winds of 85km/h (50mph). At about 10:00UTC on May19, the <b>storm</b> made landfall close to Kyaukpyu, Ramree Island, in western Myanmar.
