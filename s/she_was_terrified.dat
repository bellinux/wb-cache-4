25|$|Makeup artists Tom Burman and Bari Dreiband-Burman {{and actor}} Jeffrey Jones {{discussed}} {{the appearance of}} the Dark Overlord character with Huyck and Katz, and developed the character's progressing looks. When Katz's daughter visited the set during the shoot, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> by Jones' appearance in makeup. The diner sequence combines practical effects, including squibs and air cannons, with visual effects created by ILM. Sound designer Ben Burtt created the voice of the Dark Overlord by altering Jeffrey Jones' voice as his character transformed. Stop motion effects during the climax were designed by Phil Tippett, who began with a clay model before upgrading to more sophisticated pieces.|$|E
25|$|In January 2000, a tip-off to Scotland Yard detectives {{exposed a}} plot to kidnap Victoria and Brooklyn Beckham and hold them at a house in Hampstead, London. The family was then moved to a secret location, but no arrests were made. Later in March 2000, she {{received}} a death threat prior to performing at the Brit Awards with the Spice Girls, and in the show's rehearsal, a red laser light appeared on her chest and she was rushed off stage. After a fire door {{was found to be}} lodged open, it was thought that there had been an assassin there, and Beckham later revealed that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> by the experience. In November 2002, five people were arrested after another plot for her kidnap was infiltrated by a tabloid newspaper. All charges were dropped after a witness was deemed unreliable.|$|E
25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> that she would have to tell him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from the}} romantic theme in her storyline Ruby {{has been shown}} as an {{aspiring}} singer. Breeds is classically trained in real life and said she doesn't mind singing on camera. Discussing this she stated: [...] "When you're playing a character you can hide behind them. I know it's still my voice, [...] I was more confident singing from Ruby's point of view. Even {{though there was a}} storyline where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> about singing in a school play, I wasn't nervous at all. I had to try really hard to make myself feel nervous." [...] She revealed she had to play down her voice and make it [...] "a bit cleaner" [...] and a [...] "bit more inexperienced". This was due to the fact {{it was meant to be}} that she had never sung before â€“ [...] "I have to pull her back a bit." [...] She added the storyline was realistic because there are no set guidelines for discovering vocal talent.|$|E
500|$|Sophie Blanchard {{was born}} Marie Madeleine-Sophie Armant to Protestant parents at Trois-Canons, near La Rochelle. Little {{is known of}} her life before her {{marriage}} to Jean-Pierre Blanchard, the world's first professional balloonist. The date of her marriage is unclear; sources quote dates as early as 1794 [...] or 1797, but most state 1804, the year of her first ascent. Blanchard had abandoned his first wife, Victoire Lebrun, and their four children to travel round Europe pursuing his ballooning career, and she later died in poverty. Variously described as Blanchard's [...] "small, ugly, nervous wife", [...] "small with sharp bird-like features" [...] and later as [...] "small and beautiful", Sophie was more {{at home in the}} sky than on the ground, where her nervous disposition meant she was easily startled. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> of loud noises and of riding in carriages, but was fearless in the air. She and her husband were in an accident on a joint flight in 1807 (her 11th ascent, possibly his 61st), in which they crashed and he sustained a head injury. The shock apparently left her mute for a while.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her later}} years, Lamarr turned to plastic surgery to {{preserve}} the looks <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> of losing, but the results were disastrous. [...] "She had her breasts enlarged, her cheeks raised, her lips made bigger, and much, much more," [...] said her son, Anthony. [...] "She had plastic surgery thinking it could revive her looks and her career, but it backfired and distorted her beauty". Anthony Loder also claimed that Lamarr was addicted to pills.|$|E

2500|$|When Dottie {{married in}} 1969 and quit performing, Roger persuaded Patty to perform onstage {{for the first}} time at a country jamboree in Hodgenville, Kentucky. The forum {{consisted}} of foldout chairs in a small auditorium and was called the [...] "Lincoln Jamboree". <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> at first, but with her brother performed several songs; she loved the applause she received for her performance, and after the show she was paid five dollars, the first money she ever earned.|$|E
2500|$|Edward Hall's 2006 Propeller Company touring production, {{presented}} in the Courtyard Theatre {{as part of the}} RSC's presentation of the Complete Works, featuring an all-male cast, and starring Simon Scardifield as Katherina and Dugald Bruce Lockhart as Petruchio. This production emphasised the physical brutality of the taming, with a macho Lockhart often aggressively lashing out at [...] Scardifield, who began as a punk rebel, but who became less and less assertive as the play went on. Katherina's final speech was delivered in a manner suggesting <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> of disagreeing with Petruchio.|$|E
2500|$|In 1935, Bula Myrtle Williams invited 16-year-old Buddy McClure to {{live with}} her family. McClure had {{recently}} lost his mother and Bula was still grieving over the death of her son. Esther recounted in her autobiography that one night, {{when the rest of the}} family was visiting relatives in Alhambra, McClure raped her. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> to tell anyone about the incident and waited two years before finally revealing the truth to her parents. Williams' mother seemed unsure about her story, claiming McClure was [...] "sensitive" [...] and was sympathetic towards him when he admitted his guilt. Bula Williams then banished him from her home, McClure joined the Coast Guard, and Williams never saw him again.|$|E

2500|$|In 1925 (when Allyson was eight), a {{tree branch}} fell on her while she was riding on her {{tricycle}} with her pet terrier in tow. Allyson sustained a fractured skull and broken back, and her dog was killed. Her doctors said she would never walk again and confined her to a heavy steel brace from neck to hips for four years, and she ultimately regained her health, but when Allyson had become famous, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> that people would discover her background from the [...] "tenement side of New York City", and she readily agreed to studio tales of a [...] "rosy life" [...] including a concocted story that she underwent months of swimming exercises in rehabilitation to emerge as a star swimmer. In her later memoirs, Allyson does describe a summer program of swimming that did help her recovery.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, Jack Warner {{spoke of}} the [...] "magic quality that {{transformed}} this sometimes bland and not beautiful little girl into a great artist," [...] and in a 1988 interview, Davis remarked that, unlike many of her contemporaries, she had forged a career {{without the benefit of}} beauty. She admitted <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> during the making of her earliest films and that she became tough by necessity. [...] "Until you're known in my profession as a monster, you are not a star," [...] she said, [...] " [...] I've never fought for anything in a treacherous way. I've never fought for anything but the good of the film." [...] During the making of All About Eve, (1950) Joseph L. Mankiewicz told her of the perception in Hollywood that she was difficult, and she explained that when the audience saw her on screen, they did not consider that her appearance was the result of numerous people working behind the scenes. If she was presented as [...] "a horse's ass ... forty feet wide, and thirty feet high," [...] that is all the audience [...] "would see or care about." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{emerged during}} the trial that Nelson's sister Laura Anne had been shown Zoe's body by Bayne {{on the morning after}} her murder, but had kept this {{information}} from the police for five days. Laura Anne, who gave her evidence from behind a screen to prevent her from seeing Bayne, did not relay the information until she made her third statement to the police on 28 May, the day of Bayne's arrest. Laura Anne said that she had gone to Bayne's address on the morning after Nelson disappeared in order to return some articles of clothing to him. When she arrived she said he appeared [...] "jumpy" [...] and was drinking vodka. Shortly after that, the two had left the house and Bayne told her he had [...] "something to show her". She said that he led her to the area where he had killed Nelson and pointed out the blackened body. She said she knew it was her sister because she recognised a Rangers F.C. tattoo on her arm. In her statement she said: [...] "At Monkey Hill Rab said to me 'I hit her with my hands. She tried to hit me back.' Rab also said 'I burned her with petrol.'" [...] She testified in court that she had kept silent because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> of Bayne, although Neil Murray QC, for the defence, produced other police statements in court in which she denied she had been threatened, admitted she had been out with Bayne on the day after the body was discovered, and had also subsequently visited Bayne and spent some time in his bedroom listening to music. She also spent about an hour on the telephone to him. A friend also [...] "described her as happy and normal" [...] during the period of silence. When asked why she hadn't told the police when she was first interviewed, she said: [...] "I did not tell them about this because I was scared my mum would not believe me and think it was me who killed Zoe." [...] Bayne's grandmother testified that on the day the body was discovered, Laura Anne did not visit and he did not leave the house except to go with her to a local supermarket.|$|E
