5|$|CSU {{released}} its first prediction on December5, 2003, which projected an above average season, with 13named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. This forecast was adjusted upward <b>slightly</b> <b>on</b> April2. On May17, {{prior to the}} start of the season, NOAA forecasters predicted a 50% probability of activity above the normal range, with twelve to fifteen tropical storms, six to eight of those becoming hurricanes, and two to four those hurricanes reaching major intensity. Dr. Gray released a prediction on May 28 that was similar, with 14named storms, eightreaching hurricane strength, and threebecoming major hurricanes.|$|E

5|$|A Junkers F.13 {{called at}} Lympne on 10 January 1923 {{to clear customs}} and then flew to Croydon where it was {{inspected}} by Secretary of State for Air Sir Samuel Hoare. In February, {{it was reported that}} Lympne had taken part in a test of the newly introduced Mayday radio signal used by aircraft to indicate that they were in distress. Georges Barbot won a prize of F.25,000 from Le Matin when he made a flight from St Inglevert to Lympne and back again on the same day, 6 May. He flew the route in a Dewoitine aircraft fitted with a Clerget engine. On landing a bracing wire in the undercarriage of the aircraft broke, but repairs were effected within half an hour. Problems starting the engine then delayed his departure <b>slightly.</b> <b>On</b> 28 October the Light Aircraft Trials were held (see below). In 1923, Air Union started a service flying newspapers to Lympne using a Farman F.60 Goliath.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the club}} has had notable defeats from 2000–01 onwards, crowds have {{continued}} to be healthy. During the 2005–06 season, home attendances (that is, given attendances minus away support) increased <b>slightly</b> <b>on</b> the season before, helped by a 10,006 crowd against Carlisle {{on the final day}} of the season. That game in particular attracted a large crowd as the town of Stockport supported its team at Edgeley Park. If Stockport had lost that particular game, they would have been relegated for the second successive season, and more significantly, would have been relegated from the Football League for the first time, an embarrassment as the team has competed continuously in the Football League since 1900. Stockport eventually drew the game with Carlisle and survived the drop, while Carlisle themselves gained the league championship.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of {{reaching}} peak intensity, Mireille turned more to the northwest along the southwestern periphery of the subtropical ridge. The increasing size began to impart wind shear in Typhoon Nat to the west, and the two storms underwent the Fujiwhara effect, in which Nat turned sharply southward while Mireille progressed toward the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. After maintaining peak winds for about 30hours, Mireille began weakening, passing just east of Miyako-jima on September26 with 10‑minute winds of 165km/h (105mph), according to the JMA. That day, the typhoon accelerated to the northeast due to increasing mid-level winds from the southwest, passing west of Okinawa. According to the JMA, Mireille re-intensified <b>slightly</b> <b>on</b> September27 to a secondary peak of 175km/h (110mph), aided by unusually warm water temperatures in the East China Sea. The typhoon made landfall at that strength at 07:00UTC between Saikai and Nagasaki along southwest Kyushu. The pressure at landfall was , {{the lowest in the}} country since Typhoon Trix in 1971.|$|E

The same year, 750,000 people traveled with the commuter rail. The 20% increase that year was in part due to the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1997 being held in Trondheim, and was the service in the country with the largest growth.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Darby was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} cyclone which affected Hawaii as a tropical storm. The fifth named storm of the busy 2016 Pacific hurricane season, Darby originated from a low pressure area that developed in the Eastern Pacific well southwest of Mexico during July2016. It gained sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression on July11, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Darby the next day. Further intensification ensued, and Darby became a hurricane on July13. Over the next three days, Darby slowly strengthened to Category 3 status on the Saffir–Simpson scale, becoming a major hurricane. Cool waters and dry air caused Darby to weaken {{over the next three}} days, although Darby managed to restrengthen <b>slightly</b> <b>on</b> July21 before weakening once again as the storm neared Hawaii. Just after midnight on July24 (UTC; 2:00p.m. on July23 HST), Darby made landfall on the Big Island, and weakened into a remnant low two days later.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Faith {{reached the}} northernmost {{latitude}} {{and had the}} longest track of any Atlantic tropical cyclone. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1966 Atlantic hurricane season, Faith developed from an area of disturbed weather between Cape Verde and {{the west coast of}} Africa on August21. Tracking westward, the depression gradually intensified and became Tropical Storm Faith on the following day. Moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean, it continued to slowly strengthen, reaching hurricane status early on August23. About 42hours later, Faith reached an initial peak with winds of 105mph (165km/h), before weakening <b>slightly</b> <b>on</b> August26. Located near the Lesser Antilles, the outer bands of Faith produced gale force winds in the region, especially Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Antigua. Minor coastal damage occurred as far south as Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E

Meanwhile, NY45 was reassigned to another highway in Orange County. The portion of former NY45 from Troy to Averill Park became part of NY66 while the remainder became an eastward extension of NY43. The extended NY43 was now concurrent with US9 and US20 along Madison Avenue from Delaware Avenue to Rensselaer, where it followed Broadway and Washington Avenue to US4 in Defreestville. The route continued east to Averill Park on what had been legislative Route21.|$|E

This changed the profile of turn 12, as drivers now used {{the other side of the}} Anderson Bridge, while the hairpin at turn 13 has been widened by a metre in order to increase overtaking opportunities. The drag reduction system (DRS) had two activation zones for the race; the first between turns five and seven down the length of Raffles Boulevard, and the second on the start/finish straight between turn 23 to turn one.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Hal, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Kuring, was the strongest storm to affect {{southern}} China since 1983. Hal originated from a monsoon trough that formed in early June 1985. It gradually became better organized, and on June20, the storm attained tropical storm. Intensification continued and the storm reached typhoon intensity later that day. On the evening of June21, Hal reached peak intensity, before passing south of Taiwan. The storm weakened <b>slightly</b> <b>on</b> June22, and lost typhoon intensity two days later. Later on June24, Hal moved onshore northeast of Hong Kong. Hal dissipated three days later.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Beaver Township, {{the creek}} enters Main Township. It {{continues}} following Catawissa Mountain, and, for a shorter distance, Full Mill Hill. It picks up Gap Run and Fisher Run {{from the left}}, Scotch Run from the right, and Furnace Run from the left in quick succession. After picking up Furnace Run, Catawissa Creek flows between Catawissa Mountain and Nescopeck Mountain in a high, narrow gorge. As the creek leaves the gorge, it passes Mainville and enters a plain. The creek turns west-southwest and the plain narrows <b>slightly.</b> <b>On</b> {{the south side of}} the plain is Catawissa Mountain and on the north side are lower hills. After a few miles, the creek flows out of Main Township and into Catawissa Township. In Catawissa Township, the creek flows southwest to Catawissa. It follows the southern border of Catawissa until it reaches its edge and turns northwards, following the western border of Catawissa. Pennsylvania Route 487 crosses over the creek at this point. At the western edge of Catawissa, the creek empties into the Susquehanna River.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Darby turned west-southwestwards as it {{continued}} to weaken, but the shear diminished <b>slightly</b> <b>on</b> July21, allowing Darby to restrengthen to winds of 65mph (100km/h). The reprieve was short-lived, however, as an approaching upper-level low once again increased shear over the system the next day. Darby began to curve back to the west on July23 as it approached a weakness in the aforementioned subtropical ridge, all the while weakening slowly. Just after 00:00UTC on July24 (2:00p.m.HST on July23), Darby made landfall on the Big Island {{near the village of}} Pahala in the Kaʻū District, with winds of 40mph (65km/h). This marked only the fifth time that a tropical cyclone of tropical storm intensity or higher made landfall on one of the major islands in the state of Hawaii since record keeping began in 1949, with the others being an unnamed tropical storm in 1958, Hurricane Dot in 1959, Hurricane Iniki in 1992, and Tropical Storm Iselle in 2014. After crossing the Big Island, Darby began to accelerate northwestwards in earnest while maintaining as a minimal tropical storm. On July25, Darby weakened into a depression, and degenerated into a remnant low the next day 265mi (425km) west-northwest of Honolulu.|$|E

5|$|The {{weakening}} trend ended {{early on}} September26 and Bonnie regained tropical storm status that afternoon as deep convection re-established itself. Bonnie continued its change in direction, {{turning to the}} southeast at this point as it slowly redeveloped despite being in a high-shear environment. It had also briefly showed signs of becoming extratropical on September27 as it made the turn to the northeast as a weak tropical storm, and was operationally declared extratropical at that point until the afternoon of September28. During that period, Bonnie actually strengthened back into a high-end tropical storm. Bonnie roughly followed Hurricane Charley's path towards the Azores thereafter. The storm became entrenched in an environment with greater wind shear, although it only weakened <b>slightly</b> <b>on</b> September29 as it accelerated towards the northeast. The storm crossed over the Azores on September30 as a strong tropical storm with 65mph (100km/h) winds. After that, Bonnie quickly lost its tropical characteristics and was declared extratropical late that afternoon, {{just east of the}} Azores. The extratropical low drifted back to the southwest in a clockwise loop, actually approaching the Azores once again while dissipating. It dissipated on October2.|$|E
