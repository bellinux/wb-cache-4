5|$|The {{primary cause}} of lead's {{toxicity}} is its interference {{with a variety of}} enzymes because it binds to <b>sulfhydryl</b> groups found on many enzymes. Part of lead's toxicity results from its ability to mimic other metals that take part in biological processes, which act as cofactors in many enzymatic reactions, displacing them at the enzymes on which they act. Lead is able to bind to and interact with many of the same enzymes as these metals but, due to its differing chemistry, does not properly function as a cofactor, thus interfering with the enzyme's ability to catalyze its normal reaction or reactions. Among the essential metals with which lead interacts are calcium, iron, and zinc.|$|E

40|$|All {{cells have}} {{a large number of}} {{proteins}} containing easily oxidized <b>sulfhydryls</b> that may participate in oxidation-mediated events, and these sites must be protected from irreversible oxidation during these important regulatory events. Protein <b>sulfhydryls</b> can be oxidized to several states that can be demonstrated in intact proteins. These include reversibly oxidized forms such as protein disul®de, S-thiolated, S-nitrosylated, and sulfenic acid as well as more highly oxidized states such as the sul®nic and sulfonic acid forms of protein cysteines (Fig. 1). The latter two oxidized states are currently believed to be irreversibly oxidized in intact cells, i. e. not susceptible to reduction by cellular metabolism. It is probable that the intracellular glutathione pool is critically involved in protecting protein <b>sulfhydryls</b> from irreversible oxidation. Because aging is associated with decreased glutathione concentration (Nuttall et al., 1998; Cudkowics et al., 1999; Hagen et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2000), protection of protein <b>sulfhydryls</b> is probably compromised, as organisms age.

40|$|The C {{fragment}} of tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT-Hc) with different conformations was observed {{due to the}} four cysteine residues within it which could form different intramolecular disulfide bonds. In this study, we prepared and compared three types of monomeric TeNT-Hc with different conformational components: free <b>sulfhydryls</b> (50 kDa), bound <b>sulfhydryls</b> (44 kDa), and a mixture of the two conformational proteins (half 50 kDa and half 44 kDa). TeNT-Hc with bound <b>sulfhydryls</b> reduced its binding activity to ganglioside GT 1 b and neuronal PC- 12 cells compared to what was seen for TeNT-Hc with free <b>sulfhydryls.</b> However, {{there was no significant}} difference among their immunogenicities in mice, including induction of antitetanus toxoid IgG titers, antibody types, and protective capacities against tetanus neurotoxin challenge. Our results showed that the conformational changes of TeNT-Hc resulting from disulfide bond formation reduced its ganglioside-binding activity but did not destroy its immunogenicity, and the protein still retained continuous B cell and T cell epitopes; that is, the presence of the ganglioside-binding site within TeNT-Hc may be not essential for the induction of a fully protective antitetanus response. TeNT-Hc with bound <b>sulfhydryls</b> may be developed into an ideal human vaccine with a lower potential for side effects.

40|$|ABSTRACT: N-Ethylmaleimide, {{an agent}} which alkylates free <b>sulfhydryls</b> in proteins, {{has been used}} to probe the role of <b>sulfhydryls</b> in kinesin, a motor protein for the {{movement}} of membrane-bounded organelles in fast axonal transport. When squid axoplasm is perfused with concentrations of N E M higher than 0. 5 mM, organelle movements in both the anterograde and retrograde directions cease, and the vesicles remain attached to microtubules. Incubation of highly purified bovine brain kinesin with similar concentrations of N E M modifies the enzyme's microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity and promotes the binding of kinesin to microtubules in the presence of ATP. These results suggest that alkylation of <b>sulfhydryls</b> on kinesin alters the conformation of the protein in a manner that profoundly affects its interactions with ATP and mi-crotubules. The NEM-sensitive <b>sulfhydryls,</b> therefore, may provide a valuable tool for the dissection of functional domains of the kinesin molecule and for understanding the mechanochemical cycle of this enzyme. T e microtubule (Mt) -stimulated ATPase kinesin has been proposed to be a motor protein responsible for the movement of membrane-bounded organelles in fast axonal transport in neurons (Brady, 1985; Vale et al., 1985 a).

Arsenic has a high affinity for <b>sulfhydryls,</b> and the interaction of As(III) and As(V) with biological <b>sulfhydryls</b> and cellular uptake was investigated in this study. Incubation of rat blood at 1 mM arsenic showed As(V) uptake, membrane and protein binding to be time dependant. These processes were almost immediate with As(III) incubation. Incubation at 25 mM As(V) resulted in 40 % thiol depletion with no oxidized glutathione formation. Metabolite analysis showed half of the As(V) converted to As(III). In As(III) incubation, 27 % thiol depletion occurred with 300 % increase in GSSG.

This investigation was initially conducted to evaluate the mechanism of the increased stability towards cysteine challenge reported for the label and subsequently to determine the role of ascorbate in the labeling process. METHODS: It was possible to reproduce the reported high labeling efficiencies by increasing the dithionite concentration fivefold, presumably because of variabilities among lots of commercial sodium dithionite. RESULTS: Despite success in labeling, {{it was not possible to}} confirm that antibody reduction followed the treatment with ascorbate.

Disulfide-reductants release spermatozoa through {{the reduction of}} sperm surface 25 disulfides to <b>sulfhydryls.</b> Herein, we studied sperm surface protein sulphydryls through labelling with maleimidylpropionyl biocytin in the initial sperm suspension, in the subpopulations able and unable {{to adhere to the}} in vitro cultured oviductal epithelium, and in spermatozoa released either through the disulfide-reductant penicillamine or the sulfated glycosaminoglycan heparin.

Results 30 showed that the level of <b>sulfhydryls</b> in sperm surface proteins was: 1) low in adhering spermatozoa; 2) high in spermatozoa unable to adhere; 3) markedly increased in released spermatozoa. Adhesion assays showed that: 1) penicillamine-released spermatozoa promptly recovered adhesion after removal of the disulfide-reductant and could be released again in response to penicillamine; 2) conversely, a limited number of heparin-released spermatozoa was able to readhere to the oviductal epithelium and this 35 ability was not affected by heparin removal.

40|$|In Bos taurus, at ejaculation, epididymal sperm {{acquire a}} number of {{proteins}} secreted in the seminal plasma that increase their ability {{to interact with the}} female reproductive tract. Sperm-oviduct interaction comprises a transient sperm adhesion to the isthmus, the lower portion of the oviduct, followed by sperm release around ovulation. Oviductal fluid molecules, such as sulfated glycoconjugates and disulfide-reductants, are able to release bovine ejaculated sperm bound to the oviductal epithelium in vitro through the reduction of sperm surface protein disulfides to <b>sulfhydryls.</b> To understand whether the sperm molecules sensitive to releasing signals are already exposed on the surface of epididymal sperm, we studied the ability of cauda epididymal sperm to adhere to the oviductal epithelium and to be released by sulfated glycoconjugates and the disulfide-reductant penicillamine. Surface protein <b>sulfhydryls</b> in cauda epididymal sperm were analyzed in the initial suspension, in sperm bound to the in vitro-cultured oviductal epithelium, and in released sperm. Results showed that epididymal sperm are able to bind the oviductal epithelium in vitro, although at a lower extent than frozen-thawed ejaculated sperm; the interaction is mediated by oviductal cell microvilli that closely bind to the plasma membrane of the sperm head rostral region, as previously shown for ejaculated sperm. The sulfated glycoconjugates heparin, fucoidan, and dextran sulfate, as well as the disulfide-reductant penicillamine, are all powerful inducers of sperm release. The level of <b>sulfhydryls</b> in sperm surface proteins was (1) high in the initial sperm suspension; (2) low in bound sperm; (3) markedly increased in sperm released by heparin or by penicillamine.
