5|$|Among vertebrates, the Australian {{frilled lizard}} (Chlamydosaurus kingii) has a startling display in which wide semicircular frills on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> are fanned out; the mouth is opened wide exposing the gape; the tail is waved over the body, {{and the body}} is raised, so that the animal appears as large and {{threatening}} as possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of a}} banded sea krait is black, with lateral {{nostrils}} and an undivided rostral scale. The upper lip and snout are characteristically colored yellow, and the yellow color extends backward on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> above the eye to the temporal scales.|$|E
5|$|Millipede eyes {{consist of}} several simple flat-lensed ocelli {{arranged}} in a group or patch on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> These patches are also called ocular fields or ocellaria. Many species of millipedes, including the entire order Polydesmida and cave-dwelling millipedes such as Causeyella and Trichopetalum, had ancestors that could see but have subsequently lost their eyes and are blind.|$|E
50|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} includes hypertrophied {{development of}} odontodes arranged in brushes along <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and on <b>the</b> spine and rays <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pectoral fins in mature males. Females also possess such brushes along <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> {{but do not}} seem to develop pectoral-fin enlarged odontodes.|$|R

5|$|The larvae have silk glands {{which are}} located on the labium. These glands are {{modified}} salivary glands. They use these silk glands to make silk for cocoons and shelters. Located below the labrum are the mandibles. On each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> there are usually six stemmata just above the mandibles. These stemmata are arranged in a semicircle. Below the stemmata {{there is a small}} pair of antennae, one on each side.|$|E
5|$|After implantation, {{around the}} second to third week the {{developing}} embryo consists of three layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. The {{first part of the}} ear to develop is the inner ear, which begins to form from the ectoderm around the 22nd day of the embryo’s development. Specifically, the inner ear derives from two thickenings called otic placodes on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> Each otic placode recedes below the ectoderm, forms an otic pit and then an otic vesicle. This entire mass will eventually become surrounded by mesenchyme to form the bony labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|Ducks are {{medium-sized}} aquatic {{birds with}} broad bills, {{eyes on the}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> fairly long necks, short legs set far back on the body, and webbed feet. Males, known as drakes, are often larger than females (simply known as ducks) and are differently coloured in some breeds. Domestic ducks are omnivores, eating a variety of animal and plant materials such as aquatic insects, molluscs, worms, small amphibians, waterweeds, and grasses. They feed in shallow water by dabbling, with their heads underwater and their tails upended. Most domestic ducks are too heavy to fly, and they are social birds, preferring to live and move around together in groups. They keep their plumage waterproof by preening, a process that spreads the secretions of the preen gland over their feathers.|$|E

50|$|The {{nominate}} subspecies from Tristan {{differs from}} that from Nightingale Island, with the Tristan birds being warm dark brown on the upperparts rather than dull sooty-brown, rufous rather than dark fuscous on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> and rufous-brown, rather than brownish-black, on the underparts. Birds from Inaccessible Island appear to be intermediate, with <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> a specimen from there speckled both rufous and fuscous.|$|R
5|$|Flatfish are {{demersal}} fish (bottom-feeding fish) that show {{a greater degree}} of asymmetry than any other vertebrates. The larvae are at first bilaterally symmetrical but they undergo metamorphosis during the course of their development, with one eye migrating to the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> and they simultaneously start swimming on their side. This has the advantage that, when they lie on the seabed, both eyes are on top, giving them a broad field of view. The upper side is usually speckled and mottled for camouflage, while the underside is pale.|$|E
5|$|Pleuronectiformes (flatfish) are {{an order}} of ray-finned fish. The most obvious {{characteristic}} of the modern flatfish is their asymmetry, with both eyes on the same <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> in the adult fish. In some families the eyes are always {{on the right side}} of the body (dextral or right-eyed flatfish) and in others they are always on the left (sinistral or left-eyed flatfish). The primitive spiny turbots include equal numbers of right- and left-eyed individuals, and are generally less asymmetrical than the other families. Other distinguishing features of the order are the presence of protrusible eyes, another adaptation to living on the seabed (benthos), and the extension of the dorsal fin onto the head.|$|E
5|$|Reaching {{a length}} of at least , the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} has a trowel-shaped pectoral fin disc with a short, blunt snout and concave leading margins. The medium-sized eyes are followed by smaller, nearly circular spiracles with smooth rims. A pair of large electric organs are located on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils with a three-lobed posterior margin. The narrow, highly protrusible mouth is encircled by a deep groove. The teeth are small and diamond-shaped with pointed tips; they are arranged with a quincunx pattern into bands, which remain exposed when the mouth is closed. There are five pairs of gill slits beneath the disc.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species have}} paired {{cerebral}} organs, sacs whose only openings {{are to the}} outside. Others species have unpaired evertible organs {{on the front of}} their heads. Some have slits along the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> or grooves obliquely across the head, and these may be associated with paired cerebral organs. All of these are thought to be chemoreceptors, and the cerebral organs may also aiding osmoregulation. Small pits in the epidermis appear to be sensors. On their head some species have a number of pigment-cup ocelli, which can detect light but not form an image. Most nemerteans have two to six ocelli, although some have hundreds. A few tiny species that live between grains of sand have statocysts, which sense balance.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese sleeper ray has {{an almost}} {{circular}} pectoral fin disc wider than long. Two large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{under the skin}} on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> The small, protruding eyes are immediately followed by larger spiracles with prominently raised, smooth rims. The nostrils are small and placed close together, and between them is a curtain of skin that overlaps the mouth. The protrusible mouth forms a short, transverse line and {{is surrounded by a}} deep groove. There are fewer than 25 tooth rows in each jaw, arranged into bands; the teeth are small with oval bases and pointed crowns. Five pairs of short gill slits are located {{on the underside of the}} disc.|$|E
5|$|The holotype {{and only}} known specimen, {{which is in}} very poor condition, is {{preserved}} in the Museum d'Histoire Naturel de Neuchâtel as specimen MHNN 91.2426. It has five auricular lobules {{in front of the}} ears on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> 39 rows of scales around the midbody, keels on its dorsal scales, and the third supraocular scale in contact with the frontal scale, all characters which align it with Trachylepis rather than Mabuya. The other putative mainland South American Trachylepis, T.maculata, has five instead of three keels, 32 to 34 midbody scales, and separated parietal scales. T.tschudii agrees with the Noronha skink in size, coloration, numbers of scales, and discrete characters, such as having the supranasal, parietal, and prefrontal scales all in contact.|$|E

5|$|The {{milk shark}} has a slender build with a long, pointed snout, large, round eyes with nictitating {{membranes}} (protective third eyelids), and no spiracles. On each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> behind {{the corner of}} the jaw, there are usually seven to 15 enlarged pores. The nostrils are small, as are the adjacent triangular skin flaps. There are long furrows at the corners of the mouth on both the upper and lower jaws. The tooth rows number 2425 in both jaws. The upper teeth are finely serrated and strongly oblique; the lower teeth have a similar shape, though the serrations are smaller and the tips curve gently upward. The teeth of juveniles are smooth-edged.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the finless sleeper ray is oval in shape; it is slightly wider than long in adults, and circular or longer than wide in juveniles. The small and bulging eyes are immediately followed by smooth-rimmed spiracles of roughly equal size.

The flattened teeth have hexagonal bases and are arranged into narrow bands. There are five pairs of short gill slits.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the onefin electric ray is wider than long and almost circular in shape. The two large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{beneath the skin}} on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> The eyes are small and protruding; the larger spiracles lie closely behind and have three small finger-like projections on their rims. The nostrils are placed rather close together, and between them is a long skirt-like flap of skin that reaches the mouth. The small and protrusible mouth is nearly straight and surrounded by prominent furrows. The teeth are tiny and pointed. There are five pairs of small gill slits {{on the underside of}} the disc.|$|E

5|$|While most insects {{have three}} simple eyes, or ocelli, only two ocelli {{are present in}} all species of Lepidoptera, except a few moths, one on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> {{near the edge of}} the {{compound}} eye. On some species, sense organs called chaetosemata are found near the ocelli. The ocelli are not homologous to the simple eyes of caterpillars which are differently named as stemmata. The ocelli of Lepidoptera are reduced externally in some families; where present, they are unfocussed, unlike stemmata of larvae which are fully focussed. The utility of ocelli is not understood at present.|$|E

Some time later, Oskar shows Eli a private place he knows. Unaware that Eli is a vampire, Oskar suggests that they form a blood bond, and cuts his hand, asking Eli to do the same. Eli, thirsting for blood but not wanting to harm Oskar, laps up his spilled blood before running away. Lacke's girlfriend, Virginia, is subsequently attacked by Eli. Lacke turns up in time to interrupt the attack. Virginia survives, but soon discovers that she has become painfully sensitive to sunlight. Seeking Lacke, Virginia visits Gösta, only to be fiercely attacked by Gösta's cats. In the hospital, Virginia, who has realized what she has become, asks an orderly to open the blinds in her room. When the sunlight streams in, she bursts into flames.|$|E
5|$|Matt Bissonnette, a SEAL {{who participated}} in the raid, wrote an account of the mission in the book No Easy Day (2012), which {{significantly}} contradicts Pfarrer's account.

According to Bissonnette, when bin Laden peered out at the Americans advancing on his third-floor room, the SEAL who fired upon him hit him on the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> Bin Laden stumbled into his bedroom, where the SEALs found him crumpled and twitching on the floor in a pool of body matter, with two women crying over his body. The other SEALs allegedly grabbed the women, moved them away, and shot bin Laden repeatedly in the chest until he was dead. According to Bissonnette, the weapons in the room—an AK-47 rifle and a Makarov pistol—were unloaded.|$|E
