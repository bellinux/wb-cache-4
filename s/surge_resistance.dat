40|$|Hybrid or full {{electric}} propulsions for inland {{ships are}} becoming more popular. In these application, direct-drive PM propulsion motors are a preferred machine configuration. This paper discusses the challenges to determine the losses, as estimated with simulations, during the testing procedures of a 350 kW at 300 rpm, respectively. The full-load testing of the drive system is performed by mechanically coupling two identical machines, of which one operates as a motor and the other as a generator, or 2 ̆ 2 back-to-back 2 ̆ 2 testing configuration. Two Direct-Drive PM machines have been manufactured to validate key findings from the modelling, particularly in terms of loss predictions, thermal modelling and influence of the design features such as magnet segmentation. A back-to-back set-up is created for testing these machines with a speed range of 0 - 450 rpm. Before the measurement commended, tests were carried out in accordance with IEC 60034 - 1, IEC 60034 - 15, IEC 60085 - 1, IEEE 43, IEEE 118 and Lloyd's register. These tests included: <b>surge,</b> <b>resistance,</b> winding symmetry, high voltage test, insulation resistance and polarization index. All these tests were successfully completed and agreed with the analysis as described before. Following the motors have been installed in an inland ship hybrid propulsion...|$|E
40|$|Downsizing {{is widely}} {{considered}} one of the main path to reduce the fuel consumption of spark ignition internal combustion engines. As known, despite the reduced size, the required torque and power targets can be attained thanks to an adequate boost level provided by a turbocharger. However, some drawbacks usually arise when the engine operates at full load and low engine speeds. In fact, in the above conditions, the boost pressure and the engine performance are limited since the compressor experiences close-to-surge operation. This occurrence is even greater in case of extremely downsized engines with a reduced number of cylinders and a small intake circuit volume, where the compressor works under strongly unsteady flow conditions and its instantaneous operating point most likely overcomes the steady surge margin. In the paper, both experimental and numerical approaches are followed to describe the behavior of a small in-series turbocharger compressor. Measurements are carried out on the test facility of the University of Genoa. The compressor is included in the in-series intake circuit and a pulsating flow is generated by a motor-driven cylinder head fitted with a variable valve actuation system. Different rotational speeds and various intake valve opening strategies, characterized by different opening durations, are considered. In each investigated operating point, close-to-surge operating conditions are promoted. The unsteady compressor behavior is investigated in terms of instantaneous inlet and outlet static pressures, mass flow rate and turbocharger rotational speed. The numerical activity is performed at the University of Naples. The experimental test-rig is schematized in a commercial 1 D code. The compressor is described following an enhanced map-based approach, where proper capacities are placed upstream and downstream the compressor {{to take into account the}} mass and energy storage phenomena inside the device. The model is validated for various rotational speeds and valve lift strategy, the numerical/experimental comparisons denoting a satisfactory agreement. After the above validation, the methodology is employed to analyze the effect of the engine rotational speed and of the valve lift strategy on the <b>surge</b> <b>resistance.</b> The results show that, for the higher engine speeds, the compressor simply experiences soft-surge phenomena. On the contrary, below a well specified engine speed, flow reversal within the intake system occur and typical deep-surge cycles arise. In addition, valve lift strategies characterized by shorter opening durations seem to most likely promote the surge onset...|$|E

After several pulses have passed, the diode fails, because its forward resistance increases 3 times, and the temperature greatly exceeds the acceptable level.

40|$|Despite being {{a common}} viral disease, {{influenza}} has very negative consequences, causing {{the death of}} around {{half a million people}} each year. A neuraminidase located {{on the surface of the}} virus plays an important role in viral reproduction by contributing to the release of viruses from infected host cells. The treatment of influenza is mainly based on the administration of neuraminidase inhibitors. The neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir, laninamivir, oseltamivir and peramivir have been commercialized and have been demonstrated to be potent influenza viral neuraminidase inhibitors against most influenza strains. In order to create more potent neuraminidase inhibitors and fight against the <b>surge</b> in <b>resistance</b> resulting from naturally-occurring mutations, these anti-influenza drugs have been used as templates for the development of new neuraminidase inhibitors through structure-activity relationship studies. Here, we review the synthetic routes to these commercial drugs, the modifications which have been performed on these structures and the effects of these modifications on their inhibitory activity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Triazole {{fungicides}} {{are used}} broadly {{for the control}} of infectious diseases of both humans and plants. The <b>surge</b> in <b>resistance</b> to triazoles among pathogenic populations is an emergent issue both in agriculture and medicine. The non-rational use of fungicides with site-specific modes of action, such as the triazoles, may {{increase the risk of}} antifungal resistance development. In the medical field, the surge of resistant fungal isolates has been related to the intensive and recurrent therapeutic use of a limited number of triazoles for the treatment and prophylaxis of many mycoses. Similarities in the mode of action of triazole fungicides used in these two fields may lead to cross-resistance, thus expanding the spectrum of resistance to multiple fungicides and contributing to the perpetuation of resistant strains in the environment. The emergence of fungicide-resistant isolates of human pathogens has been related to the exposure to fungicides used in agroecosystems. Examples include species of cosmopolitan occurrence, such as Fusarium and Aspergillus, which cause diseases in both plants and humans. This review summarizes the information about the most important triazole fungicides that are largely used in human clinical therapy and agriculture. We aim to discuss the issues related to fungicide resistance and the recommended strategies for preventing the emergence of triazole-resistant fungal populations capable of spreading across environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} downward scaling in {{integrated circuit}} (IC) technologies {{has led to}} rapid shrinking of transistor and interconnect feature sizes. While scaling benefits transistors by increasing the switching speed and reducing the power consumption, it has an adverse impact on interconnects by degrading its electrical performance and reliability. Scaling causes reduction in interconnect linewidth, which leads to <b>surge</b> in <b>resistance</b> due to increased contributions from grain boundary and surface scattering of electrons in the metal lines. Further, current density inside interconnects is also enhanced by the reduced linewidth and is approaching or exceeding the current carrying capacity of the existing interconnect metals, copper (Cu) and tungsten (W). The resulting failure due to electromigration presents a critical challenge for end-of-roadmap IC technology nodes. Therefore, alternative materials such as nanocarbons and silicides are being investigated as potential replacements for Cu and Was they have superior electrical and mechanical properties in the nanoscale. In this review, the electrical properties of nanocarbons, in particular carbon nanotubes (CNTs), are examined and their performance and reliability in the sub- 100 nm regime are assessed. Further, the measured properties are used to project 30 nm CNT via properties, which are {{compared with those of}} Cu and W. Department of Applied Physic...|$|R

In spite of its recent clinical use, there are few reports of BDQ-resistant strains [4, 5]. Mutations in the rv 0678 gene encoding the MmpL 5 efflux pump repressor generate low-level BDQ resistance and clofazimine (CFZ) cross-resistance [6]. To our knowledge, this is the sole mechanism of BDQ resistance described in clinical strains [4, 5]. Despite its introduction in France in 2011 for XDR- and MDR-tuberculosis (TB) treatment, we report herein four BDQ-resistant cases, and discuss strategies to avoid a <b>surge</b> of BDQ <b>resistance...</b>|$|R

Starting 2011 with two pilot projects, KE-pioneered overhead ABC conversion venture would be covering more PMTs and consumers soon. Around 560,000 consumers have benefited from the conversion thus far. [...] The advantages of thermoplastic ABC conversion include mitigation of losses caused due to illegal hook connection, prevention of theft of copper conductor, prevention of fatal accidents, minimising of tripping, minimising of complaints of power failure. After ABC treatment, these wires will have higher current rating and lower short circuit rating, higher insulation and moisture resistance, better <b>resistance</b> to <b>surge</b> currents, better <b>resistance</b> to chemicals and corrosion, low dielectric losses, longer service life, better electrical and mechanical properties while being smaller in diameter and lower in weight.|$|R
40|$|Macrolide {{resistance}} in Mycoplasma pneumoniae is {{often found in}} Asia but is rare elsewhere. We report the emergence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae in Israel and the in vivo evolution of such resistance during the treatment of a 6 -year-old boy with pneumonia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a leading respiratory pathogen in both pediatric (1, 2) and adult (1, 3) populations. Macrolides are considered {{the first line of}} therapy and are almost the only treatment for children. In recent years, alarming rates of M. pneumoniae with macrolide resistance (< 90 %) have occurred in eastern Asia, including the People’s Republic of China, Japan, and Korea (2, 4 – 7). This was initially reported in children; however, a <b>surge</b> of <b>resistance</b> in adults was recently reported (2, 4, 7). Macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae has also been suggested to be associated with a longer course of disease (2, 4). In the Western Hemisphere, lower rates of macrolide resistance have been reported (< 10 %), however, several epidemics with notable complications have occurred (8 – 11). We report the detection of macrolide {{resistance in}} M. pneumoniae in Israel. The Study A previously healthy 6 -year-old boy was hospitalized after 2 weeks with fever up to 40 °C. At onset of illness, a diagnosis of pharyngitis was made. Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from his throat, and amoxicillin was prescribed without any clinical response. Later, a clinical diagnosis of sinusitis was made, and amoxicillin-clavulanate was prescribed. A chest radiograph done at that time reportedly showed no abnormalities. Laboratory investigation before admission showed leukocytosis of 19, 600 cells/mm 3 with 2, 200 monocytes/mm 3 and 7, 600 neutrophils/mm 3; L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 1, 854 U/L (reference value up to 600 U/L) ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the renewed}} {{interest}} in political barriers in a contemporary teichopolitical era and an expanding body of research on border-related matters, meagre academic attention has been directed at linking aesthetics with teichopolitics. By means of a pluralist, reflective and multidisciplinary document-based approach, this thesis seeks to address this knowledge gap by exploring {{the ways in which}} aesthetic aspects provide an important and valuable source of insight and alternate meanings. The argument put forth is, hence, that the intellectually longstanding yet largely neglected field of aesthetic can contribute to a more profound and nuanced understanding of modern-day teichopolitics. Furthermore, the paper examines the links between ‘aesthetic borderscaping’ and teichopolitical practices through a comparative study of the US-Mexico Wall and the West Bank Wall, the two most prominent great walls in present-day world politics. More specifically, the discussion focuses on the <b>surge</b> of creative <b>resistance</b> that have emerged in response to the erection of these two barriers. In so doing, it delves into the teichopolitical ‘spectacle’ that is played out in the global public ‘theatre’. It uncovers how walls, as historically intrinsic features of the human landscape, serve as both sights and sites in which complex politics is performed, contradicted, contested and negotiated by a multitude of actors across spatio-temporal and demographic dimensions...|$|R
40|$|Gram-negative {{bacteria}} {{are known to}} cause severe infections in both humans and animals. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Gram-negative bacteria is a major challenge {{in the treatment of}} clinical infections globally due to the propensity of these organisms to rapidly develop resistance against antimicrobials in use. In addition, Gram-negative bacteria possess highly efficient mechanisms through which the AMR can be disseminated between pathogenic and commensal bacteria of the same or different species. These unique traits of Gram-negative bacteria have resulted in evolution of Gram-negative bacterial strains demonstrating resistance to multiple classes of antimicrobials. The evergrowing resistance issue has not only resulted in limitation of treatment options but also led to increased treatment costs and mortality rates in humans and animals. With few or no new antimicrobials in production to combat severe life-threatening infections, AMR has been described as the one of the most severe, long-term threats to human health. Aside from overuse and misuse of antimicrobials in humans, another factor that has exacerbated the emergence of AMR in Gram-negative bacteria is the veterinary use of antimicrobials that belong to the same classes considered to be critically important for treating serious life-threatening infections in humans. Despite the fact that development of AMR dates back to before the introduction of antimicrobials, the recent <b>surge</b> in the <b>resistance</b> towards all available critically important antimicrobials has emerged as a major public health issue. This review thus focuses on discussing the development, transmission and public health impact of AMR in Gram-negative bacteria in animals...|$|R
40|$|Enteric fever {{caused by}} Salmonella enterica is a {{life-threatening}} systemic illness of gastrointestinal tract especially in tropical countries. Antimicrobial therapy is generally indicated but resistance towards commonly used antibiotics has limited their therapeutic usefulness. Therefore, we aimed {{to determine the}} antimicrobial susceptibility pattern by minimum inhibitory concentration method of common therapeutic regimens against Salmonella enterica from enteric fever clinical cases. Salmonella enterica clinical isolates recovered from the patients with suspected enteric fever whose blood samples were submitted to microbiology laboratory of Manmohan Memorial Community Hospital, Kathmandu, from March 2016 to August 2016, were studied. These isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing against common therapeutic antimicrobials by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentration of ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, chloramphenicol, and cefixime was determined by Agar dilution method based on the latest CLSI protocol. A total of 88 isolates of Salmonella enterica were recovered from blood samples of enteric fever cases. Out of them, 74 (84. 09 %) were Salmonella Typhi and 14 (15. 91 %) were Salmonella Paratyphi A. On Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility testing, entire isolates were susceptible to cotrimoxazole, cefixime, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and chloramphenicol. Sixty-four (72. 7 %) Salmonella enterica isolates were nalidixic acid resistant and nonsusceptible to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. On MIC determination, four Salmonella isolates were ciprofloxacin resistant with MIC 1 [*]µg/ml and two isolates were ciprofloxacin intermediate with MIC 0. 5 [*]µg/ml. The MIC range of azithromycin was from 0. 125 [*]µg/ml to 2. 0 [*]µg/ml, whereas that for chloramphenicol was 2. 0 [*]µg/ml– 8. 0 [*]µg/ml and for cefixime was 0. 0075 – 0. 5 [*]µg/ml, respectively. Despite global <b>surge</b> of antimicrobial <b>resistance</b> among Salmonella enterica clinical isolates, the level of drug resistance in our study was not so high. However, higher level of NARST strains limits therapeutic use of fluoroquinolones and necessitates the routine monitoring of such resistance determinants in order to effectively and rationally manage enteric fever cases...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{antibiotics}} {{have been}} available for humans only the last 70 years and have been a prerequisite {{for the success of}} modern medicine. A strong correlation exists between inappropriate use of antibiotics and development of antibiotic resistance. Presently, a worldwide <b>surge</b> in <b>resistance</b> poses {{one of the most serious}} threats to global public health. Antibiotic resistance has been low in Norway but little is known about the extent of antibiotic use in hospitals. Our aim was to analyse the pattern and temporal trends of antibiotic use and to evaluate appropriate methods for a routine antibiotic surveillance. For eight Health Enterprises (HEs), from 2002 to 2007 there was an increase in total use of antibiotics of 18 % measured as WHO defined daily doses (WHO DDDs) per 100 bed days, while broad-spectrum antibiotics increased by 48 %. The increases were even more pronounced for medical, surgical and intensive care departments (26 % and 60 %). An important conclusion was that when surveillance results are reported the amounts of antibiotics should be related to both the number of bed days and the number of discharges. In another data set of all 22 Norwegian HEs for the period 2006 – 2011, we first showed that for hospital patients WHO DDDs for several antibiotics were set too low, particularly so for penicillins. The data were re-analysed using hospital-adjusted doses (haDDDs), which were the doses recommended in hospital guidelines. Surveillance results were substantially altered when the haDDDs were applied rather than the WHO DDDs, most importantly revealing a more pronounced broad-spectrum antibiotic use. With use of a multivariate linear regression model we then investigated patient- and hospital-related factors that might affect the use of antibiotics in hospitals. The factors identified were mostly non-modifiable. A residual variance (30 % – 50 % for all antibiotics; 50 % – 70 % for broad-spectrum antibiotics) were not explained, and are probably prescriber-related. List of papers.

The added resistance experiments include calm water, head wave, and oblique wave cases {{with a focus}} on establishing a validation benchmark for CFD codes computing the added resistance and motions of the ship model during maneuvering. The ship used is a 1 / 85. 19 scale KRISO Container Ship, KCS, model with a length of 2. 70 m. Tests were performed at the IIHR wave basin. The 20 x 40 x 4. 5 m wave basin is equipped with 6 inline plunger type wave makers and a 3 degrees of freedom carriage. A 4 degrees of freedom, surge, heave, roll, and pitch free mount with a mass spring damper system was used to tow the model. Calm water tests were performed for 13 Froude numbers between 0. 0867 and 0. 2817. The resistance coefficients, sinkage, and trim were found for each test. The calm water results were obtained and compared to results from towing tank facilities, with traditional mounts, to estimate facility biases at the IIHR wave basin. The results show that the size difference of the IIHR model and surge free motion create magnitude differences between facilities. Head and oblique wave tests were performed at Froude number 0. 26 and wave height to wavelength ratio, H/λ, of 0. 0167. For all wave tests, time histories of wave amplitude, resistance, and 4 DOF were measured. Fourier analysis was completed for all time histories of waves, forces, and motions and the 0 th, 1 st, and 2 nd harmonic amplitudes and phases are presented. All head wave results are compared to other facilities data taken in a towing tank with a traditional mount. The data from all wave heading data was analyzed {{with a focus on}} the trends with incremented wave encounter angle. Most harmonic amplitudes show good agreement between all facilities, but removal of the small model used by IIHR shows even better agreement between facilities. The oblique wave heading data shows good agreement with the only other experimental oblique wave added resistance testing. Complete uncertainty analysis was completed for select cases for calm water, head wave, and oblique wave conditions. The uncertainty showed accurate data form most wavelength settings...|$|R
