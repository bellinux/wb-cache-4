50|$|The {{program was}} {{created as a}} satirical news {{magazine}} and as such did not feature an intricate studio decoration. Instead, Hildebrandt — feigning provincial innocence — would <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> and comment on recent events from a satirical perspective, combined with 3-5 minute long clips about the subjects.|$|E
50|$|A vivarium may {{be small}} enough to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> or table, such as a {{terrarium}} or an aquarium, or may be a very large structure, possibly outdoors. Large vivaria, particularly those holding organisms capable of flight, typically include {{some sort of a}} dual-door mechanism such as a sally port for entry and exit, so that the outer door can be closed to prevent escape before the inner door is opened.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, the sundials {{are formed}} as hollows in a solid object, e.g., a {{cylindrical}} hollow {{aligned with the}} Earth's rotational axis (in which the edges {{play the role of}} styles) or a spherical hollow in the ancient tradition of the hemisphaerium or the antiboreum. (See the History section above.) In some cases, these multiface dials are small enough to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk,</b> whereas in others, they are large stone monuments.|$|E

50|$|A {{tabletop}} unit {{is a type}} of multi-effects {{device that}} <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> and is controlled manually. One such example is the Pod guitar amplifier modeler. Digital effects designed for DJs are often sold in tabletop models, so that the units can be placed alongside a DJ mixer, turntables and CD scratching gear. For a DJ, <b>a</b> pedal located <b>on</b> the floor would not be practical because she/he would find it hard to adjust the knobs.|$|R

40|$|Personal {{computers}} have not {{lived up to}} their name. Most machines <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> and interact with users for {{only a small fraction}} of the day. Notebook {{computers have}} become smaller and faster, enabling mobility, but the same staid user paradigm persists. Typically you must stop everything you’re doing, use both hands, and give the computer your full attention. Wearable computing is poised to shatter our preconceptions of how we should use a computer. A personal computer should be worn like eyeglasses or clothing and continuously interact with the user on the basis of context. With heads-up (head-mounted) displays...|$|E
40|$|Photograph {{of three}} men in an {{observation}} {{room at the}} Marine Exchange, ca. 1920 - 1929. In the foreground to the left, {{a man wearing a}} suit can be seen facing away from the viewer and looking through a telescope at center. In the background at right, two additional men wearing suits can be seen. The man to the far right <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> and looks off to the left. At center, the other man can be seen sitting in a chair while talking <b>on</b> <b>a</b> telephone. Two other telephone systems can be seen nearby. To the left of the man, a large megaphone is visible. Three large windows and two circular lights are seen in the room...|$|R
5|$|The {{video is}} shot in {{black-and-white}} and {{is set in}} a dimly lit and smoky office, where Beyoncé puts <b>on</b> <b>a</b> private show for a detective (played by actor Brett G. Smith). As the clip begins, the detective is gazing out the window. Beyoncé then arrives and stands in an open doorway while rain pours outside. With wavy hair and winged eyeliner, Beyoncé is dressed in a thigh-length leather trench coat and high stockings. After walking inside the office, she immediately strips off her coat. This reveals a satin dress over black panties and thigh-high pantyhose held up by garters. When the music starts, Beyoncé <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> and plays with her hair, her back facing the face of the detective. The latter leans against his desk while watching Beyoncé, who starts to dance sensually on the desk and flips her hair to seduce him. As Beyoncé dances around the armchair, she exposes her vintage-style underwear.|$|R

An elderly man in glasses sits at <b>a</b> wooden <b>desk</b> at center looking at a roll of {{blueprints}} in front of him. A younger man {{in a dark suit}} leans over the desk from the far side. A stack of papers <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the near side of the desk while more papers <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> second <b>desk</b> <b>on</b> the far left. <b>A</b> closed <b>desk</b> sits in the left background with a map of California above it...|$|R

The best rag was in French," [...] replied O'Hara, who then {{proceeded}} to explain in detail the methods he had employed to embitter {{the existence of the}} hapless Gallic exile with whom he had come in contact. It was that gentleman's custom to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> certain <b>desk</b> while conducting the lesson. This desk chanced to be O'Hara's. On the principle that a man may do what he likes with his own, he had entered the room privily in the dinner-hour, and removed the screws from his desk, with the result that for the first half-hour of the lesson the class had been occupied in excavating M. Gandinois from the ruins. That gentleman's first act on regaining his equilibrium had been to send O'Hara out of the room, and O'Hara, who had foreseen this emergency, had spent a very pleasant half-hour in the passage with some mixed chocolates and a copy of Mr Hornung's Amateur Cracksman. It was his notion of a cheerful and instructive French lesson.|$|R
5000|$|Beyond stereo sound-stage requirements, {{a linear}} phase {{response}} helps impulse response remain true to source without encountering [...] "smearing". An unqualified {{reference to a}} monitor often refers to a near-field (compact or close-field) design. This is a speaker small enough to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stand or <b>desk</b> in proximity to the listener, so {{that most of the}} sound that the listener hears is coming directly from the speaker, rather than reflecting off of walls and ceilings (and thus picking up coloration and reverberation from the room). Monitor speakers may include more than one type of driver (e.g., a tweeter and a woofer) or, for monitoring low-frequency sounds, such as bass drum, single-driver subwoofer cabinets may be used.|$|R
