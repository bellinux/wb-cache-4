25|$|The {{government}} decided {{to rebuild a}} fort in stone near the first forts rather than at Kaskakia. Construction began in 1753 and was mostly completed in 1756; however, construction continued at the site for another four years. The limestone fort had walls 15-ft (3m)-high and 3-ft (1m)-thick, enclosing an area of 4 acres (16,000m²). The <b>stone</b> <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> was quarried in bluffs {{about two or three}} miles (4km) distant and had to be ferried across a small lake.|$|E

2500|$|Vijaya's {{architecture}} also distinguishes it {{from other}} Champa centers, since it used {{a combination of}} stone and brick elements, while most other Cham structures only used bricks. This suggests some influence from Cambodian Angkor. It also points to the relative abundance of labour in Vijaya compared to other Champa centers of powers, because processing <b>stones</b> <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> was more labour-intensive than the production of bricks.|$|R
5000|$|The convent house, {{a typical}} form of castle of Teutonic Knights, was erected {{in the late}} 13th [...] - [...] early 14th century.

This makes it likely he was also a stonemason.|$|E

Although Sir Thomas subsequently commissioned a full survey of the ruins, they remained neglected for decades.

5000|$|The last {{church was}} too small. Thus, in 1863, Admiral Bonard {{decided to build}} a wooden church {{on the bank of}} Charner canal (Kinh Lớn).

50|$|Although the {{architecture}} is predominantly Maya there are slight non-Maya influences from the neighbouring non-Maya area, such as long structures connected end-to-end. The architecture at El Puente {{also tends to}} lack the symmetry found in traditional Maya sites with a long occupational history, perhaps due to a lesser level of technical ability. For example, stairways on the main buildings are of different sizes {{on each of the}} four sides of the structures. Quality of workmanship in the working of <b>stone</b> <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> can differ markedly from one building to the next, or even within the same structure.|$|E
