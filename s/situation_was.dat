5|$|A less {{contentious}} standoff {{also occurred}} when settlers sent by William Penn sought to establish {{what is now}} Burlington, New Jersey. Andros insisted they {{had no right to}} settle there without the duke's permission, but agreed to allow their settlement after they agreed to receive commissions falling under the authority of the New York gubernatorial administration. This <b>situation</b> <b>was</b> permanently resolved in 1680 when York renounced in favor of Penn his remaining claims to West Jersey.|$|E
5|$|As Buxton's trade {{fell into}} decline {{he tried to}} survive by working as a botanical {{collector}} and delivering newspapers, but eventually {{had to rely on}} a fund set up by Binney for ‘the relief and encouragement of scientific men in humble life’. This <b>situation</b> <b>was</b> compounded when the proceeds from the second edition of his book, published in 1859, were less than anticipated because of competition from Grindon's Manchester Flora published in the same year.|$|E
5|$|As {{the morning}} passed, General Walker {{decided that the}} <b>situation</b> <b>was</b> most {{critical}} in the Naktong Bulge area of the US 2nd Division sector. There the North Koreans threatened Miryang {{and with it the}} entire Eighth Army position. At 11:00 Walker ordered US Marine Corps Brigadier General Edward A. Craig, commanding the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, to prepare the marines to move at once. The marines made ready to depart for the Naktong Bulge at 13:30.|$|E
50|$|The Qualitative Change {{principle}} {{dictates that}} solutions {{can be found}} where the main problem element or variable in the existing <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> either totally eliminated or even reversed.In other words, a problematic element in a <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> neutralized, so it no longer presents an obstacle. It can also {{be the case that}} the problematic element becomes a key positive factor; the <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> ‘reversed’, and the disadvantage transforms into an advantage.|$|R
40|$|Deontic attitudes, such as obligations, are {{normally}} formalised in a modal logic {{in which some}} possible worlds are preferable to others, and an obligation is fulfilled {{if it is true}} in {{the best of all possible}} worlds. Obligations that are not fulfilled may, none the less, be compatible with other possible worlds that are less than ideal. We propose a formalisation, which agrees with these intuitions, but in which deontic attitudes are formalised in non-modal, first-order logic, and collections of possible worlds are single first-order models with an explicit representation of time. The formalisation treats the case in which a certain desirable <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> obligatory as the problem of generating a model in which a sentence of the form desirable situation less desirable <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> true, and where models in which desirable <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> true are preferable to models in which desirable <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> false and less desirable <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> true instead...|$|R

5|$|At {{first the}} {{operation}} went well, with little {{resistance from the}} North Vietnamese. By early March 1971 the <b>situation</b> <b>was</b> changing.

5|$|Bodyline, {{also known}} as fast leg theory bowling, was a cricketing tactic devised by the English cricket team for their 1932–33 Ashes tour of Australia, {{specifically}} to combat the extraordinary batting skill of Australia's Don Bradman.

5|$|But on {{the wings}} the <b>situation</b> <b>was</b> different. Qanatir, {{commanding}} the Byzantine left flank which consisted of mainly Slavs, attacked in force, and the Muslim infantry on the right flank had to retreat. Amr, the Muslim right wing commander ordered his cavalry regiment to counterattack, which neutralized the Byzantine advance and stabilized the battle line on the right for some time, but the Byzantine numerical superiority caused them to retreat towards the Muslim base camp.|$|E

5|$|In Oosterbeek, the <b>situation</b> <b>was</b> {{becoming}} more desperate. Hackett {{was wounded in}} the morning and had to give up the eastern command. The RAF attempted some close support around the perimeter which just held, but shelling and sniping increased casualties by the hour. The aid stations were home to some 2,000 men, both British and German as well as Dutch civilian casualties. Because many of them were actually in the front line in homes taken over earlier in the battle, the odd <b>situation</b> <b>was</b> created where casualties were evacuated forward rather than rearwards. Without evacuation, the wounded were often injured again and some posts changed hands between the British and Germans several times as the perimeter was fought over.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1700s, Francis Hauksbee and French chemist Charles François de Fay {{independently}} discovered {{what they believed}} were two kinds of frictional electricity—one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin. From this, Du Fay theorized that electricity consists of two electrical fluids, vitreous and resinous, that are separated by friction, and that neutralize each other when combined. American scientist Ebenezer Kinnersley later also independently reached the same conclusion. A decade later Benjamin Franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical fluid, but a single electrical fluid showing an excess (+) or deficit (-). He gave them the modern charge nomenclature {{of positive and negative}} respectively. Franklin thought of the charge carrier as being positive, but he did not correctly identify which <b>situation</b> <b>was</b> a surplus of the charge carrier, and which <b>situation</b> <b>was</b> a deficit.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the species}} now {{considered}} to be Narcissus were in separate genera during the nineteenth century, and the <b>situation</b> <b>was</b> further confused by the inclusion of many cultivated varieties. By 1875 the current circumscription was relatively settled.

It shares {{its position in the}} latter tribe with Sternbergia.|$|E
