50|$|The <b>sailfin</b> <b>roughshark</b> (Oxynotus paradoxus) is {{a species}} of dogfish shark in the family Oxynotidae, found in the eastern North Atlantic from Scotland to Senegal between latitudes 41°N and 11°N, at depths of between 265 and 720 m. Its length is up to 1.2 m.|$|E
50|$|The large dorsal fins are subtriangular in shape, {{with the}} first dorsal spine sloping {{slightly}} backward. The pectoral fins have a convex front margin and a concave rear margin. The anal fin is absent. There is a strong ridge running between the pectoral and pelvic fins {{on each side of}} the body. The dermal denticles are large and widely spaced, giving the skin a very rough texture. This species differs from the similar <b>sailfin</b> <b>roughshark</b> in the positioning of the dorsal fins and the shape of the spiracle. The color is a uniform dark brown, with the lips, nasal flap margins, fin axils and inner margins of claspers white.|$|E
40|$|The dermal denticles of the <b>sailfin</b> <b>roughshark</b> Oxynotus paradoxus are {{described}} and illustrated with SEM pictures, {{based on two}} specimens captured at the Azores. The flank denticles {{are similar to those}} of O. centrina, with a central cusp flanked by two smaller lateral cusps, rising from the lateral ridges, and a secondary median cusp posterior to the main one. Differences in squamation between both species {{are described}}. Body proportions of the Azorean specimens are given and found to be consistent with those reported by previous authors. The published information shows depth of capture to have a mode at 570 m. A bathybenthic habitat has been suggested, with spring reproductive migrations to the continental shelf. The presence of this species in the Azores and Mid-Atlantic Ridge represents a significant westward extension of its previously known geographic distribution, the continental shelf and upper slope of the north and eastern Atlantic. It is possible that O. paradoxus is continuously distributed along the north-eastern Atlantic floor, deeper than presently known. Alternatively, separate slope and ridge populations may exist...|$|E
