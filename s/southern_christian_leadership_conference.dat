5|$|The {{origins of}} Operation PUSH {{can be traced}} to a {{factional}} split in Operation Breadbasket, an affiliate of the <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> <b>Conference.</b> In 1966, Martin Luther King Jr., the head of the SCLC, appointed Jackson to head the Chicago chapter of Operation Breadbasket, which became a coalition of black ministers and entrepreneurs.|$|E
5|$|The Birmingham campaign, or Birmingham {{movement}}, was {{a movement}} organized in early 1963 by the <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> <b>Conference</b> (SCLC) to {{bring attention to}} the integration efforts of African Americans in Birmingham, Alabama. Led by Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, Fred Shuttlesworth and others, the campaign of nonviolent direct action culminated in widely publicized confrontations between young black students and white civic authorities, and eventually led the municipal government to change the city's discrimination laws.|$|E
5|$|The Nashville Christian Leadership Council (or NCLC), {{was founded}} by the Reverend Kelly Miller Smith, pastor of First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill. This {{organization}} was an affiliate of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> <b>Conference</b> and was established to promote civil rights for African Americans through nonviolent civil disobedience. Smith believed that White Americans would be more sympathetic to desegregation if African Americans obtained their rights through peaceful demonstration rather than through the judicial system or violent confrontation.|$|E

5|$|Ford {{was born}} in New Orleans, Louisiana; his parents were leaders in the African American community. Ford {{attended}} Wayne State University and Grambling State University, from which he was expelled in 1969 before graduating for leading civil rights demonstrations. He was expelled by the university, despite it being historically black, because it relied on public funds which were controlled by a state government opposed to desegregation. Ford {{was a member of}} the <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> <b>Conference</b> staff from 1966 to 1972 and worked for Martin Luther King, Jr. as a member of an advance team of the Poor People's Campaign.

Ford worked as a car salesman and later became a full-time legislator. Ford is a lifelong bachelor.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, King, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, Joseph Lowery, {{and other}} {{civil rights activists}} founded the <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> <b>Conference</b> (SCLC). The group was created to harness the moral {{authority}} and organizing power of black churches to conduct nonviolent protests {{in the service of}} civil rights reform. One of the group's inspirations was the crusades of evangelist Billy Graham, who befriended King after he attended a Graham crusade in New York City in 1957. King led the SCLC until his death. The SCLC's 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom was the first time King addressed a national audience. Other civil rights leaders involved in the SCLC with King included: James Bevel, Allen Johnson, Curtis W. Harris, Walter E. Fauntroy, C. T. Vivian, Andrew Young, The Freedom Singers, Charles Evers, Cleveland Robinson, Randolph Blackwell, Annie Bell Robinson Devine, Charles Kenzie Steele, Alfred Daniel Williams King, Benjamin Hooks, Aaron Henry and Bayard Rustin.|$|E

25|$|Connor {{enforced}} legal {{racial segregation}} and denied civil rights to black citizens, {{especially during the}} <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> <b>Conference's</b> Birmingham campaign of 1963. He became an international symbol of institutional racism. Bull Connor directed the use of fire hoses and police attack dogs against civil rights activists; children protestors were also subject to these attacks. These tactics to continue white supremacy were covered by national media and broadcast on national television, horrifying much of the nation. The outrages served as catalysts for major social and legal change in the Southern United States and contributed to passage by the United States Congress of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.|$|R
5000|$|The {{rest of the}} {{convention}} week violence followed the pattern set Sunday night. Protestors were joined on 28 August by the Poor People's Campaign, now led by the <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> <b>Conference's</b> Ralph Abernathy. This group had a permit and was split off from other demonstrators before being allowed to proceed to the amphitheater. The hard line taken by the City was also seen on {{the convention}} floor itself. In 1968, Terry Southern described the convention hall as [...] "exactly like approaching a military installation; barbed-wire, checkpoints, the whole bit". Inside the convention, journalists such as Mike Wallace and Dan Rather were roughed up by security; both these events were broadcast live on television.|$|R
5000|$|Dorchester Academy was {{a school}} for African-Americans located at 8787 East Oglethorpe Highway, just outside Midway, Georgia. Operating from 1869 to 1940, its campus, of which only the 1935 Dorchester Academy Boys' Dormitory survives, was the primary site of the <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> <b>Conference's</b> Citizen Education Program. This program, ran here from 1961 to 1970, worked toward {{attaining}} equality for blacks in the American South by teaching them their rights and helping them acquire the knowledge necessary to become registered voters by passing the required test. [...] The dormitory building was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 2006 for its later role in the American Civil Rights movement, and for its association with activist Septima Poinsette Clark, who oversaw the education program. [...] The campus, which includes several later buildings, is now a museum and research center.|$|R
25|$|The three-story 16th Street Baptist Church {{had become}} a {{rallying}} point for civil rights activities through the spring of 1963, and became the location where students who were arrested during the 1963 Birmingham campaign's Children's Crusade had been organized and trained by <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> <b>Conference</b> (SCLC) Director of Direct Action, James Bevel. The church was also used as a meeting-place for other civil rights leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Ralph David Abernathy, and Fred Shuttlesworth. Tensions further escalated when the <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> <b>Conference</b> and the Congress on Racial Equality became involved in a campaign to register African-Americans to vote in Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|A {{watershed}} in {{the civil}} rights movement occurred in 1963 when Shuttlesworth requested that Martin Luther King Jr., and the <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> <b>Conference</b> (SCLC), which Shuttlesworth had co-founded, come to Birmingham to help end public segregation. King had served in Birmingham as a pastor earlier in his career.|$|E
25|$|At the time, Abernathy {{heard the}} shot {{from inside the}} motel room {{and ran to the}} balcony to find King on the deck, {{bleeding}} profusely from the wound in his cheek.

50|$|In December 1976, these 250 congregations {{formed a}} new, {{independent}} church body, the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches (AELC). The AELC was led {{first by the}} Rev. William Kohn, and, beginning in 1984, by the Rev. Will L. Herzfeld. Herzfeld, an associate of Martin Luther King, Jr. {{and former president of}} the <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> <b>Conference's</b> Alabama chapter, was the first African American to lead a U.S. Lutheran church body. AELC proved to be a more socially and theologically liberal church than the LCMS, and shortly after its inception, it departed from LCMS practice on ordination by opening the ministry to women. To ministers and parishioners who remained with the LCMS, this and other moves by the fledgling AELC may have served to validate their earlier concerns about the faculty majority at Concordia Seminary. Then LCMS vice president Roland Wiederanders, for example, wondered why the new members of the AELC had been unwilling to consider the possibility that they were changing the theology of the church, and if that were the case, why they did not just leave the LCMS and form their new organization years earlier.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{graduation}} from UC Berkeley, Freeman joined the <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> <b>Conference's</b> (SCLC) summer project, SCOPE (Southern Community Organization and Political Education). When the summer was over, {{she joined the}} SCLC staff as a field worker. For the next year she did voter registration in Alabama and Mississippi, spending {{a few days in}} jail in both states. In August 1966, when she was working in Grenada, Mississippi, the Jackson Daily News published an expose of her work as a [...] "professional agitator" [...] on its editorial page, implying that she was a communist sympathizer. Accompanied by five photographs, including one taken at Cal during the FSM, this made her a potential target for Mississippi death squads. Thirty years later a federal court order disclosed that these were provided to the newspaper by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission. An informant had documented Freeman's participation in the FSM and recognized her in Grenada. Concerned for her safety, SCLC sent Freeman back to Atlanta, where she worked in the main office and also as Coretta Scott King's assistant for six weeks. In October she was sent to work with SCLC's Chicago project. As the SCLC 's Chicago project faded out, Freeman went to work for a community newspaper, the West Side TORCH. When this job ended she tried to find jobs as a journalist and photographer in Chicago, where she was told that girls can't cover riots. Eventually she found work as a re-write editor for a trade magazine, later becoming a freelance writer.|$|R
