40|$|The {{application}} of stud arc welding process {{is well known}} in various manufacturing fields and civil engineering due to simplicity of application, short welding time and cost efficiency. In this paper, {{application of}} on-line monitoring of main welding parameters (welding current and voltage) is used in the examination of process stability during stud arc welding with ceramic ferrule. The goal of this experimental work is to make the best choice of monitored welding parameter to assure the high quality of arc <b>stud</b> <b>weld</b> joint. So, the applicability of stability evaluation methods usually used in MAG (Metal Active Gas) welding process is analyzed for stud arc welding application. The connection between stability of stud arc welding process and weld quality is evaluated through macro section analysis of the welded joints...|$|E
40|$|An {{effective}} <b>stud</b> <b>weld</b> algorithm {{has been}} developed using a tensile strength response. A multi objectives neural network modeling was used to get higher tensile strength with lower variance. A multi-layer perception (MLP) was trained by back propagation Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) [8 : 16 : 2] algorithm using sample testing measures. The result was compared with Taguchi experimental design method. The comparison shows that neural network is an effective method to represent this multi objective target problem. The verification of results shows that the ultimate tensile strength increases by 30. 84 % and the standard deviation around mean reduces by 30. 06 %. The results prove that neural network is a powerful tool to represent the multi level eight input parameters with two objectives first is to maximize the ultimate tensile strength {{and the second is}} to minimize the standard deviation of tensile strength with almost negligible error (4. 96 × 10 - 10) for representing data...|$|E
50|$|Portable <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> {{machines}} are available. Welders {{can also be}} automated, with controls for arcing and applying pressure. <b>Stud</b> <b>welding</b> is very versatile. Typical applications include automobile bodies, electrical panels, shipbuilding and building construction.

50|$|A type of <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> called capacitor-discharge (CD) <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> {{differs from}} regular <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> in that capacitor-discharge welding {{does not require}} flux. The weld time is shorter, {{enabling}} the weld to bond with little oxidation and no need for heat concentration. It also allows for small-diameter <b>studs</b> to be <b>welded</b> to thin,lightweight materials. This process uses a direct-current arc from a capacitor. The weld time in this process is between 1 and 6 milliseconds. Capacitor discharge <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> with the latest equipment can create a weld without burn through showing {{on the opposite side}} of very thin metals. CD <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> is often used for smaller diameter studs and pins, as well as on non-standard materials and for accuracy. On the other hand, arc <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> is primarily for structural purposes and larger diameter <b>weld</b> <b>studs.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Stud</b> <b>welding</b> is a {{technique}} similar to flash welding where a fastener or specially formed nut is welded onto another metal part, typically a base metal or substrate. The fastener can take different forms, but typically fall under threaded, unthreaded or tapped. The bolts may be automatically fed into the spot welder. Weld nuts generally have a flange with small nubs that melt to form the <b>weld.</b> <b>Weld</b> <b>studs</b> are used in <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> systems.|$|R

50|$|<b>Stud</b> <b>welding</b> uses {{a type of}} flux {{called a}} ferrule, a ceramic ring which {{concentrates}} the heat generated, prevents oxidation and retains the molten metal in the weld zone. The ferrule is broken off of the fastener after the weld is completed. This lack of marring on the side opposite the fastener is what differentiates <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> from other fastening processes.|$|R
40|$|Stud {{plunge depth}} {{is one of}} the {{important}} welding conditions in arc <b>stud</b> <b>welding.</b> With the analysis of the stud plunge process, the control of stud plunge depth in the stepping arc <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> was studied. The extrusion pressure between the stud and the workpiece during welding process is acted as the controlled variable. And a control system based on a displacement sensor was developed. It is indicated from the welding test results that the autocontrol of stud plunge depth using displacement sensor can be realized in stepping arc <b>stud</b> <b>welding.</b> The <b>stud</b> plunge depth {{does not need to be}} set before welding, which will redound to the automaticity of welding process...|$|R
5000|$|Friction <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> is a {{solid phase}} welding {{technique}} involving a stud or appurtenance being rotated at high speed while being forced against a substrate, generating heat by friction. The metal surfaces reach a temperature at which they flow plastically under pressure, surface impurities are expelled and a forged weld is formed. [...] This technique is rather more costly than arc <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> and is therefore used for special applications where arc welding may present problems, such as: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Stud</b> <b>welding,</b> {{also known}} as [...] "drawn arc stud welding", joins a stud and another piece of metal {{together}} by heating both parts with an arc. The stud is usually joined to a flat plate by using the stud {{as one of the}} electrodes. The polarity used in <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> depends on the type of metal being used. Welding aluminum, for example, would usually require direct-current electrode positive (DCEP). Welding steel would require direct-current electrode negative (DCEN).|$|R
50|$|The system {{requires}} a rigid clamp {{to hold the}} welding tool on the work piece and withstand the force applied to the <b>stud</b> during <b>welding.</b> Although these clamps can be moved from one weld location to the next quite rapidly they are generally larger and more cumbersome than {{is the case with}} arc <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> systems.|$|R
50|$|Friction <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> {{has been}} used to {{retrofit}} sacrificial anodes to subsea pipelines while the pipeline is “live” (that is, it continues to transport hydrocarbons at pressure). In some cases the anodes are placed on the sea bed next to the pipeline and a lug on a cable from the anode is connected to the <b>stud</b> <b>welded</b> on the pipeline. Another option is a tripartite weld where the lug on the anode cable is made of steel with a tapered hole in it. The tapered end of the <b>stud</b> <b>welds</b> through the hole onto the pipeline, welding to both the lug and the pipe and providing a fully welded connection between the anode cable and pipeline. The advantage of this method {{is that there is no}} significant increase in the electrical resistance of the connection due to corrosion during the lifetime of the pipeline. Many subsea pipelines have concrete weight coating on them and a small area of this can be removed with a water jet to permit welding.|$|R
5000|$|Friction <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> is a {{solid phase}} welding process where the metals do not liquefy. This permits metal {{combinations}} such as <b>welding</b> aluminium <b>studs</b> to steel which would be problematic with arc welding because {{of the formation of}} brittle inter-metallic compounds.|$|R

In the experimental part of the paper, the arc <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> process is applied with the application of the activating flux for ATIG process. In order to evaluate {{the influence}} of the activating flux on the welding process parameters variations, the main welding parameters were monitored by an on-line monitoring system. Besides monitoring of welding current and voltage, {{the influence of}} the activating flux on the weld joint appearance is investigated.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} the prototypical {{design and implementation}} of an Intelligent Welding Gun to help welders in the automotive industry shoot studs with high precision in experimental vehicles. A presentation of the <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> scenario and the identified system requirements {{is followed by a}} thorough exploration of the design space of potential system setups, analyzing the feasibility of different options to place sensors, displays and landmarks in the work area. The setup yielding the highest precision for <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> purposes is the Intelligent Welding Gun – a regular welding gun with a display attachment, a few buttons for user interactions, and reflective markers to track the gun position from stationary cameras. While welders operate and move the gun, the display shows threedimensional stud locations on the car frame relative to the current gun position. Navigational metaphors, such as notch and bead and a compass, are used to help welders place the gun at the planned stud positions with the required precision. The setup has been tested by a number of welders. It shows significant time improvements over the traditional <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> process. It is currently {{in the process of being}} modified and installed for productional use...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to carry out}} a straightforward way appropriate for quality monitoring and stability of arc <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> process, followed by a number of procedures to control the quality of welded samples, namely torque destructive testing and visual inspection context. Those procedures were being performed to support the monitoring system and verify its validity. Thus, continuous on-line monitoring guarantees earlier discovering <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> defects and avoiding weld repeatability. On-line welding electronic monitoring system is for non destructive determining if a just completed weld is satisfactory or unsatisfactory, depending on welding current peak value detected by the system. Also, it has been observed significant harmonize which is mutually linking the monitored current peak values and quality control measures. So this concept is accordingly contributed in the process of supporting the fundamental objective of this research. On the other hand, two feed-forward neural networks have been developed for monitoring and control arc <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> quality. First network predicts two output quality parameters (current peak value) and (torque testing value at failure). Second, predicts one output quality parameter (visual inspection). Networks have been trained to a set of data, which made them ready to receive new information for subsequent quality parameters prediction. Both networks showed up good response and acceptable result...|$|R

The cyclone barrel is constructed with water cooled, tangential oriented, tube construction. Inside the cyclone barrel are short, densely spaced, pin <b>studs</b> <b>welded</b> to the outside of the tubes.
