5|$|Eddie Izzard as {{the voice}} of Reepicheep, a swashbuckling mouse. Over 100 actors auditioned to voice the character. Izzard {{approached}} Reepicheep as less camp and more of a bloodthirsty assassin with a sense of honour (a cross between Mad Max and a Stormtrooper from Star Wars): Izzard interpreted Reepicheep as <b>someone</b> <b>whose</b> family was killed by the Telmarines. The Narnia series were some of the few books Izzard read as a child, and he cherished them. When discussing Reepicheep to the animators, Adamson told them to rent as many Errol Flynn films as possible. Adamson credits Izzard for making the role his own; beforehand, the director was approaching the character similarly to Puss in Boots in Shrek 2.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Umbricht's death, the Colts decided to honor their {{teammate}} by wearing black armbands {{for the entire}} 1964 season. Umbricht's uniform number (32) was immediately retired by the team; {{it was the first}} time the club retired a uniform number, and only the ninth time in Major League history a number was retired. In the Colts' opening-day match against the Cincinnati Reds, starting pitcher Ken Johnson dedicated his victory in Umbricht's memory. The Astros' MVP award was also named in his honor. The back of Umbricht's 1964 Topps baseball card was updated to mention his death shortly before printing. The retirement of Umbricht's number received some criticism, however. Former teammate Jimmy Wynn wrote in his autobiography that Walt Bond, a former Astros player who was African-American, died from leukemia while he was still active. His jersey number was not retired by the club after his death, although he appeared in more games for the Astros than Umbricht. (It should be noted, however, that Bond ended his career not with Houston but as a member of the Minnesota Twins.) Journalists criticizing the retirement of numbers sometimes use Umbricht as an example of <b>someone</b> <b>whose</b> number was retired but who is unfamiliar to baseball fans.|$|E

The author describes Jesus expanding on various sayings and answering questions 550 days after the Resurrection, but before the Ascension. Both James and Peter are given secret instruction, but at the end only James appears to understand what has happened. (As with the Gospel of John 1-20 and the Gospel of Mary, in this book Peter has implicitly failed the Christian movement).|$|R

25|$|In {{some studies}} Arrúe is {{presented}} as “a vascófilo within the regime”, a person who tried to accommodate Basque cultural ambitions within the Francoist system.

30|$|Durkheim (1933), as <b>someone,</b> in <b>whose</b> work, one {{can find}} {{intellectual}} roots of functionalism, believes that through a process, density is put aside more mechanically and is replaced organically (naturally) by an organized community. Organic social organization is a more specialized society in which people pursue various occupations. However, people develop separate identities and {{the point of view}} of some about the world is a bit different from others. In this type of community, individuals’ performance and groups, which are rooted in the specialized nature of jobs and in their nature change. This specialization is also applicable in the field of auditing.|$|R
40|$|While doctors {{working in}} {{hospitals}} have usually {{been regarded as}} independent contractors, liable to the patient and for whom the hospital may not be held liable by the patient, some recent cases are beginning to change this assumption, especially where the case is an emergency giving the patient no choice of doctor but the one on duty at the time. These changes have particular implications for the insurance situation, since hospitals are entitled to sue <b>someone</b> on <b>whose</b> behalf they have been found vicariously negligent. As a condition of hospital privileges, they may require evidence of the doctor's insurance protection against legal action...|$|R

However, such conceptual objections seem less strong since {{the decision of the}} House of Lords in McPhail v Doulton 1971 AC 424 where Lord Wilberforce rode roughshod over objections to widening the class of valid discretionary trusts on the basis that there would be difficulty ascertaining beneficiaries for the court to enforce the trust in favour of.|$|R

Oddly for <b>someone</b> <b>whose</b> last 16 first-class innings had produced only 43 runs, McMahon opened the batting throughout the 1959-60 season. He scored 42 in the first match against Central Districts and 41 in the next against Otago, but only 29 in the next three matches, and he returned to the tail in 1960-61. In 1960-61 he set a new record for the Plunket Shield when he made 23 dismissals (22 caught, one stumped) in the season.|$|E
25|$|In the Basque {{provinces of}} Biscay and Gipuzkoa, it was {{uncommon}} {{to take a}} surname from the place (town or village) where one resided, unless one was a foundling; in general, people bearing surnames such as Bilbao (after the Basque city of Bilbao) are descendants of foundlings. However, in the Basque province of Alava and, to a lesser extent, in Navarre, it was common to add one's birth village to the surname using the Spanish particle de to denote a toponymic, particularly when the surname was a common one; for instance, <b>someone</b> <b>whose</b> surname was Lopez and whose family was originally from the valley of Ayala could employ Lopez de Ayala as a surname. This latter practice is also common in Castile.|$|E
25|$|Shelley {{promoted}} Keats as <b>someone</b> <b>whose</b> achievement {{could not}} be separated from agony, who was 'spiritualised' by his decline and too fine-tuned to endure the harshness of life; the consumptive, suffering image popularly held today. The first full biography was published in 1848 by Richard Monckton Milnes. Landmark Keats biographers since include Sidney Colvin, Robert Gittings, Walter Jackson Bate and Andrew Motion. The idealised image of the heroic romantic poet who battled poverty and died young was inflated by the late arrival of an authoritative biography and the lack of an accurate likeness. Most of the surviving portraits of Keats were painted after his death, and those who knew him held that they did not succeed in capturing his unique quality and intensity.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Broadway {{production was}} produced by Irene Mayer Selznick. It opened at the Shubert in New Haven shortly {{before moving to the}} Ethel Barrymore Theatre on December 3, 1947. Selznick originally wanted to cast Margaret Sullavan and John Garfield, but settled on Jessica Tandy and Marlon Brando, who were virtual unknowns at the time. The opening night cast also included Kim Hunter as Stella and Karl Malden as Mitch. Tandy was cast after Williams saw her performance in a West Coast production of his one-act play Portrait of a Madonna. Williams believed that casting Brando, who was young for the part as it was originally conceived, would evolve Kowalski from being a vicious older man to <b>someone</b> <b>whose</b> unintentional cruelty can be attributed to youthful ignorance. Despite its shocking scenes and gritty dialogue, the audience applauded for half an hour after the debut performance ended.|$|E

Reason? His music lasts" [...] , and [...] "As Stravinsky said, one never thinks of Beethoven as a superb orchestrator because the quality of invention transcends mere craftsmanship. It is the same with Stockhausen: the intensity of imagination gives rise to musical impressions of an elemental and seemingly unfathomable beauty, arising from necessity rather than conscious design" [...]|$|E

500|$|Simon Leng, Harrison's musical biographer, {{describes}} the period {{immediately following the}} tour as [...] "open season on Harrison". Whereas Rolling Stone had declared in 1973 that Harrison had [...] "inherited the most precious Beatle legacy – the spiritual aura that the group accumulated", now the magazine's album reviewer attacked him for his [...] "insufferable" [...] spiritual preoccupations. Writing in the NME, Woffinden similarly dismissed Dark Horse as [...] "the product of a complete egotist ... <b>someone</b> <b>whose</b> universe is confined to himself. And his guru." [...] Privately, Harrison descended into a [...] "spiritual funk", Tillery writes. Another biographer, Joshua Greene, concludes of Harrison's post-tour mindset: [...] "He grappled with the depressing realization that most people simply didn't care to hear about Krishna or maya or getting liberated from birth and death ... A man whose natural instinct was to share his life-transforming discoveries with others had been rejected ..." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{mass media}} has often speculated about a romantic {{relationship}} between Vidya and her co-actors, but she has strongly denied these reports. In 2009, Vidya {{was involved in a}} controversy when she mentioned a previous relationship in which [...] "caustic remarks" [...] were made at her due to her weight. She said, [...] "If someone who matters to you takes you down, it can break you. That <b>someone</b> <b>whose</b> approval mattered to me started to constantly find faults with me. At that point of time, it was important to walk away from that relationship." [...] Though she refused to name the person, tabloid reports suggested that she was referring to Shahid Kapoor (her co-star in Kismat Konnection). Kapoor, however, denied the allegations. During an interview in May 2012, Vidya announced that she was dating Siddharth Roy Kapur, the CEO of UTV Motion Pictures. On 14 December 2012, the couple were married in a private ceremony in Bandra, Mumbai.|$|E
5000|$|Freud made a key {{distinction}} between tendentious and non-tendentious humor. Tendentious humor involves a [...] "victim", <b>someone</b> at <b>whose</b> expense we laugh. Non-tendentious humor {{does not require}} a victim. This innocuous humor typically depends on wordplay, and Freud believed it has only modest power to evoke amusement. Tendentious humor, then, is the only kind that can evoke big laughs.However, Freud believed a mixture of both tendentious and non-tendentious humor is required to keep the tendentious humor from becoming too offensive or demeaning to its victim. The innocent jokework of the innocuous humor would mask the otherwise hostile joke and therefore [...] "bribe" [...] our senses, allowing us to laugh at what would otherwise be socially unacceptable. Therefore, we often think we are laughing at innocuous jokes, but what really makes them funny is their socially unacceptable nature hidden below the surface.|$|R
5000|$|The nonidentity problem (also {{called the}} paradox of future individuals) in {{population}} ethics is the problem that an act may still be wrong {{even if it is}} not wrong for anyone. More precisely, the nonidentity problem is the inability to simultaneously hold the following beliefs: (1) a person-affecting view; (2) bringing <b>someone</b> into existence <b>whose</b> life is worth living, albeit flawed, is not [...] "bad for" [...] that person; (3) some acts of bringing someone into existence are wrong even if they are not bad for someone.|$|R
6000|$|The {{worst of}} scandals becomes romantic and even respectable in two {{thousand}} years; witness that of Cleopatra with Cæsar, Mark Antony and other gentlemen. The most virtuous read of Cleopatra with sympathy, even in boarding-schools, {{and it is}} felt that were she by some miracle to be blotted out {{of the book of}} history, the loss would be enormous. The same applied to Helen, Phryne, and other bad lots. In fact now that one comes to think of it, most of the attractive personages in history, male or female, especially the latter, were bad lots. When we find <b>someone</b> to <b>whose</b> name is added [...] "the good" [...] we skip.
