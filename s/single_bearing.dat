The advantage of the vertical machine over the horizontal machine is that the noise emitted during production is much lower due to less vibration.|$|E

5000|$|A {{full-floating axle}} shaft does not carry the vehicle's weight; it serves only to {{transmit}} torque from the differential to the wheels. It [...] "floats" [...] inside an assembly {{that carries the}} vehicle's weight. Thus the only stress it must endure is torque (not lateral bending force). Full-floating axle shafts are retained by a flange bolted to the hub, while the hub and bearings are retained on the spindle by a large nut. In contrast, a semi-floating design carries {{the weight of the}} vehicle on the axle shaft itself; there is a <b>single</b> <b>bearing</b> {{at the end of the}} axle housing that carries the load from the axle and that the axle rotates through.|$|E
50|$|Some {{machines}} {{which actually}} load {{from the top}} are otherwise much more similar to front-loading horizontal-axis drum machines.

Clothes are loaded, the hatch and lid are closed, and the machine operates and spins just like a front-loader. These machines are narrower but usually taller than front-loaders, usually have a lower capacity, and are intended for use where only a narrow space is available, as is sometimes the case in Europe. They have incidental advantages: they can be loaded without bending down; they do not require a perishable rubber bellows seal; and instead of the drum having a <b>single</b> <b>bearing</b> on one side, it has a pair of symmetrical bearings, one on each side, avoiding asymmetrical bearing loading and potentially increasing life.|$|E

50|$|The pedal spindle is {{threaded}} to match a threaded {{hole at the}} outboard end of the cranks. Multi-piece cranks have a 9/16 in hole with 20 TPI (a diameter/pitch combination fairly unique to this application). One-piece cranks use a 1/2 in by 20 TPI hole. French pedal spindles use M14 x 1.25 (14 mm metric diameter with 1.25 mm pitch) threads, and thread loosely into a 9/16 pedal hole. The threading size is often stamped into the crank, near the pedal hole.The right-side (usually the drive-side) pedal spindle is right-hand threaded, and the left-side (usually the non-drive-side) pedal spindle is left-hand (reverse) threaded to help prevent it from becoming loose by an effect called precession.Although the left pedal turns clockwise on its bearing relative to the crank (and so would seem to tighten a right-hand thread), the force from the rider's foot presses the spindle against the crank thread at a point which rolls around clockwise {{with respect to the}} crank, thus slowly pulling the outside of the pedal spindle anticlockwise (counterclockwise) because of friction and thus would loosen a right-hand thread.For a short time in the early 1980s, Shimano made pedals and matching cranks that had a 1 in by 24 TPI interface. This was to allow a larger <b>single</b> <b>bearing,</b> as these pedals were designed to work with just one bearing on the crank side rather than the conventional design of one smaller bearing on each side.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Bearing is a {{component}} {{that affects the}} performance of a rotating machine in order to be used properly. The purpose of using ball bearing is to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads. Diagnosis of bearing vibration data is an important process to identify either the bearing is normal or defect. In this paper, we consider a <b>single</b> <b>bearing</b> system that consists of one normal or defect Fan End (FE) bearing in which an accelerometer is attached to both normal and defect FE bearing to capture the vibration data. These vibration data are grouped into several samples data. Five parameters are extracted from each sample to be used as the input in neural network model and class of target output is either normal or defect. Those five parameters are standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, absolute mean and root mean square. Our objectives are to find the dominant parameters and the best model for fault diagnosis of <b>single</b> <b>bearing</b> system. It is important to find the dominant parameters since the selection of dominant parameter can reduce the pre-processing data phase. According to our observation that the dominant parameter is either of standard deviation, absolute mean or root mean square and the best BPNN model is the model with one input neuron and one neuron in hidden layer...|$|E
40|$|Trains {{including}} reciprocating {{machines are}} subject to the most varied and often most severe torsional disturbances in comparison to other machinery classes. If crankshaft or rotating component failures occur as a result of shaft torsional oscillations, the consequences can be catastrophic. In this paper a new comprehensive model and solution method using analytical formulations are developed to study both steady state and transient response of complex reciprocating trains. Analytical results are presented and recommendations for torsional reliable trains are addressed. Couplings being the more accessible components within the train are often modified to tune the overall system. Recommendations for coupling: High torsional stiffness coupling (best option if allowed by torsional analysis), or flexible coupling (more elasticity and damping and more maintenance) or integral rigid forged flange connection (rugged train, less elasticity and damping) with <b>single</b> <b>bearing</b> electric machine...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Twenty-five multiparous Rambouillet ewes were used {{to determine the effects of}} feeding monensin during late gestation and early lactation on prepartum and postpartum ewe body weight, milk production, blood glucose levels, and lamb production. Ewes were grouped into singles and twins by sonogram results, allotted to pens in pairs and assigned to either an ionophore (diet I with 70 mg daily) or non-ionophore (diet 2) treatment groups in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement. All ewes were fed according to NRC (1985) diet one or two beginning an average of 56 d prepartum. There were no differences in prepartum weight gain or postpartum weight loss between treatments (P>. 05). There were no differences in lamb birth weights or postnatal body weight gain to 40 d (P>. 05). Nfilk collection was conducted prior to the morning feeding by removing the lamb(s) from the pen, injecting Iml (5 USP) oxytocin intrajugular, evacuating the udder by milking machine and discarding milk. At 3 h, ewe received I ml (5 USP) oxytocin intrajugular and udder was evacuated using milking machine. In the <b>single</b> <b>bearing</b> ewes, monensin increased milk volume 35 % for 4 d (P <. Ol), 35 % for 10 d (P <. 10), 80 % for 20 d (P <. 05), 16 % for 3 0 d (P <. 5) and no difference in 40 d. In the twin bearing ewes, monensin increased milk volume on IO d I 1 % (P <. 3), but there were no differences in the other collections. There were no differences in milk fat, proteir 4 or lactose concentrations. Data collected from this study showed that monensin increased milk production in <b>single</b> <b>bearing</b> ewes when supplemented prior to lambing and supplemented during lactation...|$|E

The bearings were maintained in a preloaded state in bearing cartridges during cycling and vibration tests. Bearings with electrophoretically deposited MoS{sub 2 } performed as well as bearings lubricated with Vydax and were the best performing candidate. All candidates were suitable for low preload applications. Bearings with TiC coated balls and bearings lubricated with sputtered MoS{sub 2 } on the races and retainers performed well at high preloads, though not as well as bearings lubricated with electrophoretic deposition of MoS{sub 2 }.
