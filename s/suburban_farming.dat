40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the development of}} rural women's commercial activities in Central Cameroon, particularly the Department of Lekié, which is adjacent to Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon. I focused on cassava processing technologies and the sale of cassavabased processed foods undertaken by women in a <b>suburban</b> <b>farming</b> village. Cassava {{is one of the}} main staple foods in central Cameroon, including in urban areas. One of its characteristics is that it keeps for a long period in the ground but deteriorates rapidly after being dug from the ground. For that reason, cassava is mostly processed and sold, especially to urban food distributors. Cassava processing is based on local women's labor, and their domestic technologies are difficult to practice in a city. In the study area, cassava-based food processing is used to prepare products for sale in the village. In recent years, with urbanization and changes in traffic conditions, it has also been commercialized in urban areas, and this change has resulted in the reevaluation of local processing technologies. Food processing using domestic technology ensures marketability in cities. Urban demand for processed foods produced in villages has increased the range of options for village women who sell such products...|$|E

40|$|In Saudi Arabia, the {{increasing}} demand in camel milk by a growing urbanized population is stimulating the development of camel dairy farms, especially around the towns. The average per capita consumption {{in the country is}} about 33 L / year. It was reported that the production of camel milk is potentially higher than that of the cow in the same farming and climatic conditions. With an individual production between 5 to 20 l/day, the production potential of camel is far away from negligible. However, the dairy value chain is not well known except for the biggest dairy farms. In the present study, a survey including 119 camel farms belonging to all kind of farming system was achieved {{in the northern part of}} the country. It showed that only 16 farms contributed to the camel milk market, the other ones producing milk only for self-consumption. The market integrated sector is weakly organized, except for the industrial farms. Indeed, it is represented by two subsystems: (i) an informal one based on <b>suburban</b> <b>farming</b> with traditional mini-dairy plants and delivering milk in local shops and retail outlets; (ii) a formal system represented by large modern dairy farms and dairy plants approved by Ministry of Agriculture. These two subsystems produced 1176. 44 t/year, while the volume selfconsumed was estimated to be 1854 t/year. Such, the market potential for camel milk could be highly developed in the future.

The Houston & Texas Central Railroad (now the DART Red Line) had come through the area in 1873, and in the twentieth century, the land became more and more part of the growing city of Dallas. In 1916, the road that is now North Greenville Avenue adjacent to the neighborhood, previously called [...] "Richardson Road," [...] was designated as Texas State Highway 6. In 1926, the road was redesignated as US Highway 75 (Route 75) and remained so until North Central Expressway was constructed in the 1950s. In the early twentieth century small parcels were utilized as <b>suburban</b> <b>farms</b> where people who worked in Dallas could maintain a semblance of rural life. Dallas oil developer William A.

40|$|The {{doctoral}} dissertation {{focuses on the}} role of part-time farms in the economic, environmental and spatial transformation of the urban fringe. On the basis of the sample of Slovene <b>suburban</b> <b>farms,</b> the impact level of the proximity of workplaces on the mobility of the agricultural workforce can be determined. It can also be determined if socio-economic characteristics of suburban agricultural economies reflect in the characteristics of farm management and in the environment. This consequently stresses the role of part-time farms in the strengthening of multi-layered agriculture. From the perspective of spatial planning, it is important to learn about the development potential of farms in the planned area and to put greater emphasis on the most vital and stable farms, whether they be pure farms or part-time farms. As an answer to the question in what way should the development potential of farms in the selected area within the acceptable temporal and financial scope be evaluated, a methodology for evaluating the development potential of <b>suburban</b> <b>farms</b> from the perspective of socio-economic and spatial conditions was formed. The evaluation was divided into four segments: the evaluation of the stability and vitality of farms; the evaluation of the expansion potential and the conflict potential among farms; the evaluation of the quality and structure of agricultural land; and the evaluation of the impacts of spatial planning and protective measures on the development potential of farms. The methodology may be employed for the evaluation of all socio-economic farm types. It was tested on the case of sample farms on the Kamniška Bistrica plain The end of the dissertation offers suggestions for spatial site selection of farms and agricultural activities in urban settlements or other planned areas. These suggestions comprise some hypothetical examples of site selection of farms in the environment to guarantee a more efficient performance of farms and only minimal conflicts {{with the rest of the}} population. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the behavior of arborescent and shrub-like activity on four <b>suburban</b> <b>farms</b> in the province of Santiago de Cuba, Cuba. 100 m 2 plots were created for species count. A flower list was made after species identification, then the alpha (α) diversity indicators were calculated (Species abundance (S), Dominance (Simpson D), and General Diversity (Shannon, H). The indicators for the beta diversity were Jaccard (Ij), Morisita-Horn (IM-H), and Ecological Subordination (ES). The data collected included 62 509 individuals from 65 families, 154 genders, and 183 species. For both groups, the alpha indicators showed an increasing trend between periods, with values ranging within the parameters for each indicator. La Caballería farm was the exception, where the Shannon diversity index (H) was not within the set range for proper diversity and abundance during the dry season. The beta diversity indicators showed differing values among the samples studied, which prove the existence of specific species adapted to the environmental conditions of the place. ...|$|R

40|$|Dairy <b>farms</b> in China’s <b>suburban</b> {{areas have}} been playing an {{important}} role in providing urban markets with fresh milk. With the rising demand for fluid milk and dairy products in the cities, there is a perception that small and scattered dairy farms in China’s provinces are gradually disappearing and more concentrated dairy cattle farming is being formed near suburban areas. This paper uses farm-level survey data and stochastic input distance functions to make estimates of total factor productivity (TFP) on <b>suburban</b> dairy <b>farms,</b> {{as well as for the}} entire dairy sector. The results show that over the past decade TFP growth has been positive on <b>suburban</b> dairy <b>farms,</b> and this rise in productivity has been driven mostly by technological change. However, at the same time we find that, on average, the same farms have been falling behind the advancing technical frontier. We also find one of the drivers of the suburban dairy sector is the relatively robust rate of technological change of these farms, which has been more rapid than on farms in the dairy sector as a whole. The results suggest efforts to achieve greater adoption of new technologies and better advice on how to use the technologies and manage productio...|$|R

40|$|This {{historical}} {{paper is}} dedicated to two individuals who probably had more influence on the development and continuing tradition of the neighborhood of “Belmont ” {{than any of the}} other people who contributed to the area: 1. Mr. Slaughter W. Ficklin—the original developer of the “Belle Mont ” estate, Mr. Ficklin was a guiding influence on the upkeep and maintenance of the large antebellum estate. Even though Mr. Ficklin was not the original owner of this estate, he did more than any of its other owners in establishing an historical landmark that was once one of the most respected properties in the area. Present day “Belmont ” comprises most of the land that Mr. Ficklin once cherished as his <b>suburban</b> <b>farm</b> just outside of Charlottesville. 2. Miss Florence Buford—the principal of Clark Elementary School from its inception in 1931 until her retirement in 1964, Miss Buford blessed the neighborhood with the illimitable energy and devotion to the youngsters of Belmont with her guiding influence that touched everyone. She can best be described with three simple adjectives: firm, fair, and beloved. It was most appropriate that a new middle school in Charlottesville be named after her. Her spirit and charisma will not be forgotten. Acknowledgments Since there is little written history on the community of Belmont, the majority of this report is based on personal interviews with residents and former residents of Belmont. These people are recognized in the bibliography. I would like to thank these many people who took their time, I would like to apologize to many other residents or former residents of Belmont that I was unable to contact.

The Sound is no exception. Yet, in spite of the serious problems facing Long Island Sound, it survives. While in many respects its health is precarious, there is reason to hope that a corner has been turned toward recovery.
