5|$|June Kim, {{the author}} and {{illustrator}} for 12 Days, primarily drew the artwork in the realism style, although she occasionally rendered characters as super-deformed versions of themselves. While the cover art incorporates red and silver coloring, the artwork primarily appears in black and white, with occasional gray shading. Kim used pen and ink as the artistic medium, then toned her art with the <b>software</b> <b>application</b> ComicStudio. For the narrative, she explores the characters' pasts through dreams, and periodic, nonlinear flashbacks. Several character traits, such as Jackie's chocolate allergy, are presented to the reader through inference rather than exposition. Additionally, Kim uses a brief, untranslated Korean song alongside the predominantly English text.|$|E

5|$|The first {{generation}} of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU1) was {{released to the public}} on October2, 2006, delivering a 20-30X speedup for some calculations over its CPU-based GROMACS counterparts. It was the first time GPUs had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations. GPU1 gave researchers significant knowledge and experience with the development of GPGPU software, but in response to scientific inaccuracies with DirectX, on April10, 2008 it was succeeded by GPU2, the second generation of the client. Following the introduction of GPU2, GPU1 was officially retired on June6. Compared to GPU1, GPU2 was more scientifically reliable and productive, ran on ATI and CUDA-enabled Nvidia GPUs, and supported more advanced algorithms, larger proteins, and real-time visualization of the protein simulation. Following this, the third generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU3) was released on May25, 2010. While backward compatible with GPU2, GPU3 was more stable, efficient, and flexibile in its scientific abilities, and used OpenMM on top of an OpenCL framework. Although these GPU3 clients did not natively support the operating systems Linux and macOS, Linux users with Nvidia graphics cards were able to run them through the Wine <b>software</b> <b>application.</b> GPUs remain Folding@home's most powerful platform in FLOPS. As of November 2012, GPU clients account for 87% of the entire project's x86 FLOPS throughput.|$|E

40|$|<b>Software</b> <b>applications</b> are {{of great}} {{importance}} in organisations, and performance of an organisation depends on how hosting of <b>software</b> <b>applications</b> are organised. This thesis deals with the question: Why and how organisations decide on specific sourcing options for <b>software</b> <b>applications</b> hosting. The thesis describes and explains sourcing decision-making processes made in the Swedish Post (MeLo) and Jönköpings Kommun (the municipality). MeLo’s sourcing decision resulted in outsourcing of hosting, and the municipality’s sourcing decision resulted in internal sourcing of hosting. Both organisations were distinguished by a decentralised structure {{to a great extent}} and showed a huge diversity in <b>software</b> <b>applications</b> used. The sourcing decisions resulted in a change to a more centralised hosting of <b>software</b> <b>applications.</b> The thesis is a retrospective case study based on semi-structured interviews and documents analysis. Concepts from the resource-based view and factors described in sourcing literature are used to analyse these sourcing decisions. From nine theoretical initial propositions 28 propositions are developed about why and how sourcing decisions are made. From these propositions, relations are described and some conclusions are presented about why and how sourcing decisions are made. The main conclusion is that maturity level regarding <b>software</b> <b>applications</b> usage seems to influences the start, the process as such, and the outcome of a sourcing decision-making process. This is explained as the more mature the organisation is regarding usage of <b>software</b> <b>applications</b> the more proactive decision-makers are in the sourcing decision. It is also identified that involved factors can be either influencing or justifying, and it is found that control of <b>software</b> <b>applications</b> usage influences the start of a sourcing decision to a high extent. The findings suggest that a sourcing decision-making process can be described as an irrational decision process that aims at increasing commitment on an already made decision. The study suggests that the less mature and more decentralised the organisation is the more reactive and the stronger influence the need to increase control over <b>software</b> <b>applications</b> have in a sourcing decision-making process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Modern {{information}} systems, such as {{enterprise applications}} and e-commerce applications, often consist of databases {{surrounded by a}} large variety of <b>software</b> <b>applications</b> depending on the databases. During the evolution and deployment of such information systems, developers have to ensure the global consistency between database schemas and surrounding <b>software</b> <b>applications.</b> However, in such situations as Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), databases are shared {{by a number of}} <b>software</b> <b>applications</b> contributed by different independent parties, and the developers of those applications often have little or no control on when and how database schema evolves over time. As a result, databases and <b>software</b> <b>applications</b> may not always remain in sync. Such inconsistency may lead to data loss, program failures, or decreased performance. The fundamental challenge in evolving and deploying such database-centric information systems is the fact that databases and their surrounding <b>software</b> <b>applications</b> are subject to independent, asynchronous, and potentially conflicting evolution processes. In this paper, we present an approach to automatically adapting <b>software</b> <b>applications</b> to the evolution of their underlying databases by graph-based schema differencing and aspect-oriented dynamic patching. Our empirical study shows that our approach can automatically adapt <b>software</b> <b>applications</b> to a number of common types of database schema evolution, which accounts for over 87. 5 % of all schema evolution in the subject system. Our approach allows database schema maintainer to evolve database schema more freely without being afraid of breaking surrounding software applications; it also allows application developers to catch up database schema evolution more quickly without diverting too much from their main business concerns.
