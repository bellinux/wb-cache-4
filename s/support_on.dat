5|$|An {{additional}} intensity to {{the rivalry}} {{is the fact}} that both Maribor and Olimpija always had <b>support</b> <b>on</b> their matches from ultras groups, called Viole Maribor (supporting Maribor), and the Green Dragons, who support Olimpija. The two groups are the largest in the country, and it is not uncommon that the matches between the two clubs were sometimes interrupted by violent clashes between the two groups or with the police. On many occasions, before or after the matches, the fans of the two clubs would also meet up and fight on the streets. One of the worst incidents, in April 2010 after a match, resulted in a stabbing of a member of the Green Dragons who, with a group of friends, got into a fight with members of the Viole in Ljubljana's railway station. However, to date, there have not been any fatalities in the country related to football violence.|$|E

40|$|Pt and Pd <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> carbon {{microspheres}} (CMS) {{are used}} as electrocatalysts for alcohol (methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol) electrooxidation in alkaline media. The results show that Pt and Pd <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> carbon microspheres give better performance for all alcohols electrooxidation than that <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> carbon black. The activity order of alcohol oxidation on Pt/C and Pt/CMS is ethylene glycol (EG) > methanol > ethanol. The EG shows the highest activity and ethanol shows the lowest activity. However, the activity order of alcohol oxidation on Pd/C and Pd/CMS is ethanol > EG > methanol and the ethanol gives the best performance. The results show that Pt is a good electrocatalyst for EG oxidation and Pd is a good electrocatalyst for ethanol oxidation.

5|$|Before announcing UDI to the nation, Smith, Lardner-Burke and the Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont visited Gibbs at Government House {{to inform}} him {{personally}} {{and ask him}} to resign. Gibbs made clear that he would not do so, but indicated that he would vacate Government House and return to his farm. When Beadle arrived later in the day, he not only persuaded Gibbs to stay at the official residence, but moved in himself to provide advice and moral <b>support.</b> <b>On</b> Beadle's counsel, Gibbs instructed those responsible for law and order in Rhodesia to stay at their posts and carry on as normal. When the Governor showed no sign of stepping down, Smith's government effectively replaced him with Dupont, appointing the latter to the post of Officer Administering the Government created by the 1965 constitution attached to UDI. Lardner-Burke asked Beadle to administer the oath of allegiance to Dupont, but was rebuffed; Beadle said he would be committing a criminal offence if he did so.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of the composition of reduced CoMo, NiMo and NiW catalysts on the catalytic performance in hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of phenol has been investigated. γ-Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 were used as supports. Different activity orders were obtained over γ-Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 supported catalysts reflecting the critical role of the support. NiMo catalyst <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> γ-alumina {{proved to be the}} most active followed by the CoMo catalyst <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> titania. CoMo and NiMo lab made catalysts were proved to be more active compared to a reduced industrial CoMo catalyst <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> γ-alumina. An increase of phenol conversion in the range 52 - 230 % was obtained at 350 °C. A series of CoMo, NiMo and NiW catalysts <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> TiO 2 was also prepared using the “Equilibrium- Deposition-Filtration ” (EDF) method. The application of this technique, instead of the classical impregnation, increased considerably the activity of the CoMo catalyst <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> titania (48 % increase of phenol conversion at 350 °C). The most active lab catalysts (wet impregnated NiMo catalyst <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> alumina, EDF CoMo catalyst <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> titania) and the industrial CoMo catalyst were evaluated after sulfidation for simultaneous HDO of phenol and HDS of dibenzothiophene. These catalysts exhibited comparable HDO activities while the first one proved to be superior in HDS.
