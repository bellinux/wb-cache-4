25|$|Because of the {{propensity}} for heavy fog {{in some parts}} of the British Isles, fog signal rules were established on the UK railway system to keep train traffic moving without incurring the severe delays that would be necessary if drivers had to stop or travel slowly up to each signal and read its indication. During heavy fog, fogsignalmen would be stationed at distant signals with a lantern and detonators – small explosive charges that could be strapped to the rail to be exploded by the wheels of a train. The fogsignalman's duty was to repeat the indication of the signal using his lantern; the <b>semaphore</b> <b>arm</b> was usually obscured by fog and hence invisible to the driver of a moving train. If the distant signal were displaying 'caution' (warning that a signal ahead was at 'danger'), the detonators remained on the rail and the fogsignalman would show a yellow lamp to show 'caution'; if the distant signal were clear, the detonators would be removed from the rails and a green lamp would be displayed.|$|E

50|$|The main {{difference}} between Bavarian home signals {{and those of}} the Reichsbahn was the shape of the <b>semaphore</b> <b>arm.</b> On Reichsbahn signals the tip of the semaphore is circular in shape; on Bavarian signals it is diamond-shaped (see illustration).|$|E
50|$|Other {{shapes and}} colours of <b>semaphore</b> <b>arms</b> {{were used for}} {{specific}} purposes in different countries around the world.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Illustration of {{signaling}} by semaphore in 18th century France. The operators {{would move}} the <b>semaphore</b> <b>arms</b> to successive positions {{to spell out}} text messages in semaphore code, {{and the people in}} the next tower would read them.|$|R
50|$|Red {{was quickly}} {{chosen as the}} best colour for <b>semaphore</b> <b>arms</b> as it was clearly visible against most backgrounds. To enhance the {{visibility}} of the arm, a marking of contrasting colour, such as a stripe or spot, is usually applied. The rear of the arm is usually coloured white with a black marking.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the weight}} {{of snow on the}} <b>semaphore</b> <b>arm</b> and/or snow and ice on the wires by which the arm should be moved had meant that when signalmen had put levers to the 'danger' {{position}} from the normal 'all clear' the signals did not fully move to 'danger' ...|$|E
5000|$|For most {{types of}} <b>semaphore</b> <b>arm,</b> the {{colour of light}} shown when the arm is in the [...] "on" [...] (most restrictive) {{position}} generally corresponds to the colour of the arm itself (i.e. red for a stop signal, yellow for a distant signal). When the arm is in the [...] "off" [...] position, a green light is displayed.|$|E
5000|$|A main signal (Hauptsignal) shows Hp 0 by a {{horizontal}} <b>semaphore</b> <b>arm,</b> one red light or two horizontal red lights. The signal requires {{the driver to}} {{stop in front of}} it. (Originally, the aspect with two red lights was called Hp 00 and had a different meaning than a single red light with regards to shunting, see #Schutzsignale, but nowadays, the meaning is the same.) ...|$|E

She listened with her capped head a little on one side like an attentive bird, and her arms unconsciously imitating the signs. Certainly, for all that she SPOKE like an American, her gesticulation was Italian.|$|R
25|$|The {{gradients}} are distressing and {{the curves}} so sharp that the drivers {{were unable to}} see the <b>semaphore</b> <b>arms</b> until tell-tale arms were erected close to the ground. The junction with the Hawthorn – Glenferrie line is highly dangerous. It is possible, by the smallest neglect {{on the part of}} the signalman, for either a Glenferrie or Kew train to be cut in halves.|$|R

50|$|The 'rest signal' (Ruhesignal) on a Bavarian {{home signal}} was signalled using an {{additional}} aspect: 'rest' (Ruhe). It {{was used in}} Bavaria from 1893 to 1975. It was the last signal from the state railway era that was retained in the signalling book of the Deutsche Bundesbahn.This was a single or twin-armed semaphore signal, which took over the function of an exist signal and enhanced it with an additional signal aspect: 'rest' (Ruhe, HpRu). The term 'rest' meant that the railway vehicles were {{to remain on the}} allocated track, although shunting was permitted. If the arm was moved to its default position (Halt) the associated track was to be immediately cleared. The aspect, 'rest', was indicated by a downward-pointing <b>semaphore</b> <b>arm</b> or, at night, by a blue light. The Deutsche Reichsbahn marked the signal with an additional board with the letters Ru on it, in order to distinguish it from a normal home signal. The <b>semaphore</b> <b>arm</b> of the rest signal had the same dimensions as those of the Bavarian home signals.|$|E
50|$|The second <b>{{semaphore}}</b> <b>arm</b> on twin-armed {{semaphore signals}} had {{a slightly different}} shape. Instead of the being {{at the very end}} of the arm, the round disc was slightly closer to the mast, so that the end of the arm projected beyond it. The predecessor to the second arm was the 'proceed slowly' disc (Langsamfahrscheibe), which could be folded away to the side when required. Up to about 1880 this was a round, green and white disc.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>semaphore</b> <b>arm</b> {{consists}} of two parts: A wooden or metal arm (or [...] "blade") which pivots at different angles, and a spectacle holding coloured lenses which move {{in front of a}} lamp in order to provide indications at night. Usually these were combined into a single frame, though in some types (e.g. [...] "somersault" [...] signals in which the arm pivoted in the centre), the arm was separate from the spectacle. The arm projects horizontally in its most restrictive aspect; other angles indicate less restrictive aspects.|$|E
50|$|Thanks to its construction, the Bavarian {{distant signal}} {{could also be}} fitted to the mast of a home {{semaphore}} signal, so that, for example, the combination of 'proceed slowly' and 'expect clear or proceed slowly' (Hp 2, Vr 102) could be displayed on the same mast using three <b>semaphore</b> <b>arms.</b> In this case, the coloured lens of the distant signal was mechanically blocked when the home signal was set to the 'stop' aspect and, sometimes, even the disc mechanism was hidden.|$|R
5000|$|Signals are erected at {{intervals}} of approximately {{a quarter mile}} (400 m) along the affected area. There are seventeen signals in all. They are numbered from [...] "1" [...] to [...] "17", with signal 1 being at the east (Dalmally) end. All except number 9 stand {{on the south side}} of the line. All the signals apart from numbers 1 and 17 carry two <b>semaphore</b> <b>arms,</b> one for each direction. The signal arms usually all stand in the 'clear' position.|$|R
5000|$|Rugby {{once had}} the largest {{concentration}} of mechanical signalling {{in the world and}} was home {{to one of the most}} impressive signal gantries in Britain. Situated to the south of the station and erected in 1895, it spanned three tracks and carried forty-four <b>semaphore</b> <b>arms.</b> Every arm was duplicated due to sighting difficulties that resulted from the Great Central Railway's 'Birdcage' bridge crossing the WCML behind the gantry's location. The gantry acquired the nickname of [...] "the Rugby Bedstead" [...] on account of its appearance.|$|R
50|$|At the {{north-east}} end of {{the platform}} is a metal semaphore tower with a lantern, a set of points, and a points indicator. The points indicator is a lamp contained in a red and white painted metal box, and wire cables and a chain connected to the points activate the <b>semaphore</b> <b>arm.</b> Further along the track to the north-east are two sets of points, both controlled by electrical motors activated by lever 11 of the signal frame in the signal cabin. To the south-west of Gill Street are three sets of semi-trailable points - which either can be manually operated or can allow trains through before resetting themselves; three points indicators (black box with white chevrons); and two cable-operated semaphore towers.|$|E
5000|$|Trains from Hereford {{passed a}} fixed Distant signal (a yellow semaphore) that was bolted, unable to move, to its signal post. This {{protected}} the junction from the branch from Gloucester, Newent and Dymock as this informed drivers to always approach this junction at Ledbury cautiously. When this junction {{was removed from}} this track in 1948, this signal now needed {{to be capable of}} being operated from the signalbox and a new signal and lever were fitted, with no spare space on the frame the new signal lever was bolted onto the outside or the frame, to the left of L1 [...] lever and given the designation [...] "0". As the signal is a yellow distant signal, so the lever is painted yellow. In 1956, a colour-light signal replaced the <b>semaphore</b> <b>arm</b> and this remains today.|$|E
50|$|The first {{pedestrian}} crossing signal was erected in Bridge Street, Westminster, London, in December 1868. It {{was the idea}} of John Peake Knight, a railway engineer, who thought that it would provide a means to safely allow pedestrians to cross this busy thoroughfare. The signal consisted of a <b>semaphore</b> <b>arm</b> (manufactured by Saxby and Farmer, who were railway signaling makers), which was raised and lowered manually by a police constable who would rotate a handle {{on the side of the}} pole. The semaphore arms were augmented by gas illuminated lights at the top (green and red) to increase visibility of the signal at night. However, in January 1869, the gas used to illuminate the lights at the top leaked and caused an explosion, injuring the police operator. No further work was done on signalled {{pedestrian crossing}}s until fifty years later.|$|E
5000|$|Los Angeles {{installed}} {{its first}} automated traffic signals in October 1920 at five locations on Broadway. These early signals, manufactured by the Acme Traffic Signal Co., paired [...] "Stop" [...] and [...] "Go" [...] <b>semaphore</b> <b>arms</b> with small {{red and green}} lights. Bells {{played the role of}} today's amber or yellow lights, ringing when the flags changed—a process that took five seconds. By 1923 the city had installed 31 Acme traffic control devices. The Acme semaphore traffic lights were often used in Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons for comedic effect due to their loud bell.|$|R
5000|$|The name Acme {{also had}} other connotations {{for people in}} Los Angeles at the time. The traffic lights in Los Angeles during the time the Warner Bros. {{cartoons}} were manufactured by the Acme Traffic Signal Company. The traffic lights paired “Stop” and “Go” <b>semaphore</b> <b>arms</b> with small red and green lights. Bells {{played the role of}} today’s amber or yellow lights, ringing when the flags changed—a process that took five seconds. [...] The Acme semaphore traffic lights were often used in Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons for comedic effect due to their loud bell which was often followed by screeching tires and many sight gags.|$|R
50|$|Before 1988, {{signalling}} in {{the metropolitan}} area was three-position speed signalling, similar to the Victorian system. All mainline signals have two signal 'heads' (originally upper quadrant <b>semaphore</b> <b>arms</b> but now colour light, LED or searchlight), both are always lit. The aspects shown depend on the allowable speed for the route set. If the route was for Normal speed, the 'proceed' component of the indication is conveyed by the top head, if the move is for Medium speed (35 km/h, such as when entering a loop or siding), the 'proceed' component of the indication is conveyed by the lower head. The colours displayed by either depended on how many blocks ahead were clear; green if two or more blocks were clear and yellow if only one was clear (i.e. the next signal showed Stop).|$|R
5000|$|Semaphore signals {{were used}} by Napoleon's army (when coupled with telescopes); later, they were adopted by the railways. They were {{patented}} in the early 1840s by Joseph James Stevens and soon became {{the most widely used}} form of mechanical signal, although they are now rapidly decreasing in number and a mere handful remain in U.S. railroad service. The <b>semaphore</b> <b>arm</b> consists of two parts: An arm or blade which pivots at different angles, and a spectacle holding coloured lenses which move in front of a lamp in order to provide indications at night. Usually these were combined into a single frame, though in some types (e.g. [...] "somersault" [...] signals in which the arm pivoted in the centre), the arm was separate from the spectacle.

50|$|The last hazards to California-bound vessels {{were the}} {{approach}} and entrance to San Francisco Bay. The Farallon Islands off {{the mouth of}} San Francisco Bay were the graveyard of several ships, and the narrow, often fog-shrouded opening into San Francisco Bay was always a danger. Soon after the ship traffic built up, ship pilots who were knowledgeable of the bay were at work boarding incoming (and outgoing) ships and guiding the ships to a safe anchorage in the bay. By 1851 the tangle of ships in the bay had {{led to the creation}} of a harbormaster who dictated where ships could drop anchor. Once inside San Francisco Bay, vessels were reported and identified to the people of San Francisco by the watchman with a telescope in a tower erected in September 1849 on Telegraph Hill, San Francisco. The watchman hoisted up the telegraph mast, one <b>semaphore</b> <b>arm</b> for a schooner, two for a brig, three for a ship and two raised about 45 degrees for a paddle steamer. These signals were soon known by most residents.|$|E
50|$|The {{shape of}} the trafficator arm is closely based upon the {{shape of the}} <b>semaphore</b> signal <b>arm</b> used by the Royal Bavarian Railway {{beginning}} in 1890. The only difference from the railway arm is that it is halved down its length so as to fit flush with the vehicle's exterior.|$|R
5000|$|On 9 December 1868, the first, non-electric, gas-lit {{traffic lights}} were {{installed}} outside the Houses of Parliament in London {{to control the}} traffic in Bridge Street, Great George Street and Parliament Street. They were proposed by the railway engineer J. P. Knight of Nottingham, who had adapted this idea from his design of railway signalling systems, and constructed by the railway signal engineers of Saxby & Farmer. The main reason for the traffic light {{was that there was}} an overflow of horse-drawn traffic over Westminster Bridge which forced thousands of pedestrians to walk next to the Houses of Parliament. The design combined three <b>semaphore</b> <b>arms</b> with red and green gas lamps for night-time use, on a pillar, operated by a police constable. The gas lantern was manually turned by a traffic police officer, with a lever at its base so that the appropriate light faced traffic. The signal was [...] high. The light was called the <b>semaphore</b> and had <b>arms</b> that would extend horizontally that commanded drivers to [...] "Stop" [...] and then the arms would lower to a 45 degrees angle to tell drivers to proceed with [...] "Caution". At night a red light would command [...] "Stop" [...] and a green light would mean use [...] "Caution".|$|R
50|$|The block {{instrument}} {{consists of a}} small cabinet; its front face displays two indicators — telegraph needles — and has a commutator handle (some early designs of {{block instrument}}s had miniature <b>semaphore</b> <b>arms</b> instead of needles). The upper indicator shows {{the state of the}} forward section, on the line leading away from the signal box. The commutator is used by the signalman to indicate the state of the section approaching his signal box, and the lower indicator repeats the commutator position. All indications are repeated on a similar instrument {{at the other end of}} the block section, in the associated signal box. The commutator has three positions and each of the two indicators has three positions: normal (or line blocked), line clear, and train on line. Either integral to the instrument or separately mounted, there is a single-stroke bell and a bell operating device, either a tapper or a plunger.|$|R
5000|$|More trains {{were bought}} in 1914 for the Bakerloo line {{extension}} to Paddington. To speed up boarding these cars had inward swinging centre doors that {{were under the}} control of the gatemen. From 1915 the Bakerloo was extended to a junction with the London & North Western Railway (LNWR) at Queens Park and because of the difficulties of World War I, cars were transferred from the Piccadilly line. From 1917 tube trains ran through to [...] using Central London Railway motor cars that had been built for an uncompleted extension to Ealing. These returned in 1920 when the extension opened and the Watford Joint Stock, two thirds owned by the LNWR, arrived. Four and six car trains were formed, a motor car permitted in the middle of a tube train as there was an emergency passage through the control compartment. Access was by three single inwardly swinging doors on either side of the cars. Cars with sliding pneumatic doors were ordered in 1919 for the Piccadilly line. No gatesmen were needed and these trains were staffed by a driver and two guards. An open door was first indicated by a <b>semaphore</b> <b>arm,</b> but these were easily damaged, and by 1923 interlock switches proving the doors were closed were introduced.|$|E
5000|$|The {{power-operated}} three-position upper quadrant semaphore signal, American in origin, {{was introduced}} to New South Wales by the English signal engineer, Mr C.B. Byles, in 1913. Mr Byles (1871-1948) led New South Wales Railways through its introduction of power signalling, from 1911 until 1929. [...] At night, two lights, one above the other, are exhibited. The spectacle attached to the signal arm has three lenses, that is a green for the vertical clear position and red for the other two lenses. In some cases the <b>semaphore</b> <b>arm</b> moves to the horizontal danger position when {{the line between the}} distant signal and the stop signal to which it applies is occupied. The Distant signals capable of exhibiting Danger are fitted with an upper red/green spectacle; the two-position versions have a fixed upper green. The Home/Starting signals give three indications. The arm moves from horizontal displaying a red light, upwards to 45 degrees displaying a green or yellow light, and fully vertical also displaying a green light. In double light areas, the lower light of these signals stays red until a full Clear indication is shown. Therefore, these signals will show the same lights indicated by the Lower Quadrant Semaphore Distant and two-arm signals, that is, two greens for Clear, a green over a red for Caution and two reds for Stop.|$|E
5000|$|Searchlight signals {{were the}} most often used signal type in the U.S. until recently, {{although}} these have become less popular due to vandalism. In these, a single incandescent light bulb is used in each head, and either an A.C. or D.C. relay mechanism is used to move a coloured spectacle (or [...] "roundel") {{in front of the}} lamp. In this manner, gravity (fail safe) returns the red roundel into the lamp's optical path. In effect, this mechanism is very similar to the colour light signal that is included in an electrically operated semaphore signal, except that the omission of the <b>semaphore</b> <b>arm</b> allows the roundels to be miniaturized and enclosed in a weatherproof housing. An elliptical reflector focuses the lamp through the roundel, a small lens and then a larger single or compound lensing arrangement is employed. The Hall Signal Company first produced this type of signal in 1920, having purchased the patent rights from one Mr. Blake in 1918. US&S bought the Hall Company in 1925 thus naming this signal the Style [...] "H," [...] with the later compound lens version (introduced in 1932) referred to as the Style [...] "H-2." [...] The General Railway Signal Company's versions were known as the [...] "Type S, SA, SA-1 and SC", the last having a sequential operating mechanism {{that could be used to}} directly replace motor-operated semaphores without any changes in system wiring.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{companies}} {{had their own}} code format which led to some confusion where trains from one company ran onto other companies' lines. The Railway Clearing House (RCH) intervened to standardise headcodes, based on four lamp positions, and they were adopted {{by the majority of}} lines outside the south of England. At the time of the 1923 Grouping the standard headcodes were simplified so that normally only two lamps were used at any one time, and these codes were adopted by the London Midland and Scottish Railway, the Great Western Railway (GWR) and the London and North Eastern Railway. The Southern Railway retained a route-based headcode system, with up to four lamps in six positions. Notable exceptions were former Glasgow and South Western Railway and the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway lines, which continued with their own headcodes on internal trains. The Caledonian Railway maintained a completely different route-based headcode system consisting of a pair of <b>semaphore</b> <b>arms</b> mounted on the locomotive - the angle of the two arms and their position (on the buffer beam or smokebox) indicated the routing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{immediate}} cause was {{the accumulation of}} snow on the <b>semaphore</b> <b>arms</b> and/or control wire of several sets of signals. On the night of the accident the weight of snow on some signal arms and wires meant that the arm balanced well short of the 'danger' position and that the spectacle plate failed to drop sufficiently to move a red lens {{in front of the white}} lamp displayed in the [...] "all clear" [...] position. The signal therefore showed a white light (apparently 'all clear') when the lever in the signal box was in fact set to danger; the snow and ice (in the words of the Inquiry Report) thus rendering the signals to be not only useless for warning by red-lights the engine-driver of the Scotch-express-train, but also a means by the exhibition of white lights of luring him forward at full speed to the collisionThe enquiry had heard evidence from experienced working-level witnesses that this (or a milder manifestation of this) was a known problem on snowy days but could easily be sorted if you knew how, e.g. by [...] "jiggling the arms". It implicitly rejected the evidence from GNR senior managers who denied that there was any prior history of problems, but made no comment on the discrepancy.|$|R
2500|$|The {{mechanical}} equivalents {{of these}} shunting signals are found as miniature <b>semaphores</b> (the <b>arms</b> {{are the same}} size as those of permissive signals) and disc varieties (the disc is about 12inches/30cm diameter). The small-arm semaphores are painted {{in the same way as}} a full-size stop signal, while the discs are painted white with a red horizontal band. A small-arm semaphore shows [...] "clear" [...] in the same way as a full-size stop signal, while a disc rotates through 45 degrees or so when pulled off so that the red band is angled. Both display small red or green lights by night.|$|R
