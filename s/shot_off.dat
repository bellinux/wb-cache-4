40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to analyze the impact of selected offensive and defensive performance indicators in relation to teams’ success in the 2010 soccer World Cup. The sample used corresponded to 54 matches played in both the group and knockout stage. The game-related statistics gathered were: total shots, shots on goal, <b>shots</b> <b>off</b> goal, % of shots on goal from total shots, % of <b>shots</b> <b>off</b> goal from total shots, offensive and defensive effectiveness 1 (goals/total shots), and offensive and defensive effectiveness 2 (goals/shots on goal). In addition, the first’s goal influence in the match’s outcome (for the team scoring the goal: win, draw, lose) was also investigated. The results showed that, during the group stage, successful teams had better values (P < 0. 05) in all offensive and defensive performance indicators, with the exception of <b>shots</b> <b>off</b> goal for and <b>shots</b> <b>off</b> goal against, respectively, than unsuccessful teams. In the knockout stage, successful teams were able to maintain the same offensive performance that in the group stage while most defensive performance indicators, with the exception of <b>shots</b> <b>off</b> goal against (P= 0. 80), tended (P< 0. 2) to worsen. During the group stage, the team scoring the first goal had 66. 7 % of victories, 4. 2 % of defeats and 29. 2 % of draws (P< 0. 001). In the knockout stage, the first goal effect had a stronger influence in game’s outcome than in the group stage (P< 0. 01) since in 81. 3 % of the cases the team scoring first won the match, versus 6. 3 % of defeats and 12. 5 % of draws. Thus, offensive variables related to shots on goal and goal effectiveness appear to be better indicators of team’s success in the last World Cup than defensive variables. This information has directly implications for coaches, providing relevant feedback to plan finishing (goal scoring) practices...|$|R

5|$|Gasketball is a part-basketball, part-puzzler shot-matching sports {{video game}} where players flick {{basketballs}} through 2D physics puzzles (with flippers, portals, circular saw blades, and gravity switches) into a basketball hoop. Some puzzles include banking the basketball <b>shot</b> <b>off</b> multiple surfaces {{before making the}} basket. In the HORSE-style games, the player must match the exact setup of the opponent's shot, such as hitting the floor before entering the hoop. In the campaign, players get more points for making the shot without retrying, and have five attempts to make the hoop {{before moving to the}} next level shamefully. Players are awarded medals for the quality of their performance {{at the end of each}} chapter. Gold medals unlock new modes of play in the chapter. Every chapter has a unique theme, such as a construction site or outer space.|$|E

5|$|Pickett's first combat command {{was during}} the Peninsula Campaign, leading a brigade that was nicknamed the Gamecocks (the brigade would {{eventually}} be led by Richard B. Garnett in Pickett's Charge). Pickett led his brigade ably in the battles of Williamsburg and Seven Pines, earning commendations from his superiors. At Gaines's Mill on June 27 he was <b>shot</b> <b>off</b> his horse while leading his brigade in its first assault. Pickett continued {{to move forward with}} his men for a while, leading his horse on foot. A second assault by Pickett's brigade, led by Colonel Eppa Hunton, along with the brigade led by Cadmus M. Wilcox, broke the Union line. Pickett feared that he had taken a mortal blow to his shoulder, but the wound was initially assessed by others as minor. The shoulder wound turned out to be severe enough that, while not fatal, Pickett was out of action for the next three months, and his arm would remain stiff for at least a year.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914 Beadles, along {{with two of his}} older brothers, Ewart and Ernie, enlisted in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, even though he was only 16 years old at the time, under the permitted age of enlistment. While his regiment was stationed in Britain on training exercises, Beadles was a bugle boy. In 1915, his unit took part in the landing at Suvla Bay in Gallipoli where, despite still being under the minimum age, he served on the frontline as a rifleman. During this time, Beadles performed an action that would later see him awarded the Serbian Gold medal for gallantry. He received the honor for saving the life of a Serbian observer officer who had been wounded in no man's land and was unable to make it back to the line. Under heavy rifle and artillery fire, Beadles helped the officer back, having his cap and epaulettes <b>shot</b> <b>off</b> in the process but remaining unharmed.|$|E
5|$|Kohli batted {{twice in}} the two-match Test series against West Indies, and had scores of 3 and 57 being {{dismissed}} by Shane Shillingford in both innings.

FA Cup replay brought Rovers another victory and a place in the Third Round thanks to Kayode Odejayi and Max Power goals. Tranmere almost hit a third consecutive league victory versus Cambridge United, but their 10-man rivals managed to equalise in the final minutes. The unbeaten run finally came to end with an away defeat to promotion contenders Burton Albion after Liam Ridehalgh was sent off following a foul in the penalty box {{in the middle of the}} first half. The game was also notable for the second Chris Shuker debut six months after he officially ended his career. The year was ended with a 2–1 home victory against relegation rivals Northampton Town.

5|$|The teams traded baskets for the {{majority}} of the second half, with the largest advantage being four points by Georgetown with over twelve minutes to go in the game. After five more minutes of game play, North Carolina managed to cut the lead to two, 56–54. The Tar Heels then obtained a single point lead with 5:50 to play and set up in their four corners offense,\ to run out the game clock. The Tar Heels were quickly fouled and Jimmy Black converted two free throws, while Fred Brown made two his own on the other end to bring the score to 59–58 in favor of North Carolina. With three and a half minutes left in the contest, Michael Jordan drove to the basket and made a <b>shot</b> <b>off</b> of the backboard to increase the Tar Heels' lead to three, 61–58. On Georgetown's following possession, Ewing made a jump shot to bring his team within one. North Carolina again set up in the four corners. While making an attempt to steal the ball from Matt Doherty, the Hoyas' Eric Smith was called for a foul. This sent Doherty to the line for a one-and-one, which he missed and Ewing got the rebound. Smith then hit a twelve-foot jump shot with 57 seconds left to go to give Georgetown the lead, 62–61. Then, Jordan received a pass from Black and connected on a shot with fifteen seconds remaining in the game to give North Carolina a one-point lead. On the Hoyas' ensuing possession, Fred Brown passed the ball away to Worthy, who proceeded to run out some of the clock before being fouled. Because the Hoyas were in the double bonus, Worthy received two free throw attempts, both of which he missed. Floyd got the rebound and attempted a last second shot that also missed.|$|E
