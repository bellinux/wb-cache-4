500|$|When he {{graduated}} from high school in 1997, Youkilis weighed about 227 pounds and was 6' 1". He was recruited by two Division I schools: Butler University and his ultimate choice, the University of Cincinnati (UC)—an institution that was the alma mater of both his father and Youkilis' longtime idol, Sandy Koufax, and had just finished a 12–46 season. UC coach Brian Cleary spotted Youkilis at a winter camp. [...] "I looked at him and <b>said,</b> <b>Well,</b> we need somebody", said Cleary. [...] "I'd love to tell you I saw something no one else did, but he was just better than what we had." ...|$|E
500|$|Concerns {{over the}} animals' safety {{prompted}} an anonymous telephone {{call to the}} Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), which dispatched a representative. Initial tests with shocking had yielded disappointing results, necessitating an increase in voltage. According to Anderson, [...] "Meddings explained that his team were laying the crocodiles down and they weren't doing anything. They were just lying there. The RSPCA man <b>said,</b> <b>well,</b> they would, because of {{the warmth of the}} lamps. So Derek said, 'We've been giving them a touch with an electrode just to make them move.' The guy asked what voltage they were using and Derek said it was about 20 volts, and the guy said, 'Oh, they've got terribly thick skins, you know. If you want them to move, you'll have to pump it up to 60.'" [...] Following an initial investigation of AP Films Studios, the allegations of mistreatment were not pursued further; the RSPCA officer later joined the crocodiles' handler in assisting with the filming.|$|E

And we thought, {{what if we}} had this character that was a neon line, and that was our Tron warrior– Tron for electronic. And what happened was, I saw Pong, and I <b>said,</b> <b>well,</b> that's the arena for him. And {{at the same time}} I was interested in the early phases of computer generated animation, which I got into at MIT in Boston, and when I got into that I met a bunch of programmers who were into all that. And they really inspired me, by how much they believed in this new realm." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{members of}} the {{scientific}} community who have reviewed Icons of Evolution have rejected his claims and conclusions. Scientists quoted in the work have accused Wells' of purposely misquoting them and misleading readers. This includes biologist Bruce Grant, who <b>said</b> <b>Wells</b> was [...] "dishonest" [...] with his work and biologist Jerry Coyne who <b>said</b> <b>Wells</b> [...] "misused" [...] and [...] "mischaracterized" [...] his work on peppered moths. Specific rejections stand beside the already broader response {{of the scientific community}} in overwhelmingly rejecting intelligent design as a valid scientific theory, instead seeing it as pseudoscience.|$|R

2500|$|It was reputedly {{the first}} in Ireland, and was ordered from Fender by Jim Connolly, a showband member {{performing}} with The Irish Showband. Connolly ordered a cherry red Stratocaster through Crowley's music shop in Cork in 1961. When Fender shipped a sunburst Stratocaster instead, it was put up on sale in 1963 as a second-hand instrument, which Gallagher bought in August 1963 for just under £100 at Crowley's Music Store on Cork's McCurtain Street. Speaking about Gallagher's purchase of the famous Stratocaster his brother Dónal recalled: [...] "His dream ambition {{was to have a}} guitar like Buddy Holly... This Stratocaster was in the store as a used instrument, it was 100 pounds... in today's money you couldn't even compare you might as well say it was a million pounds... my mother was saying we'll be in debt {{for the rest of our}} lives and Rory <b>said</b> <b>well</b> actually with a guitar like this I can play both parts, rhythm and lead, we won't need a rhythm player so I can earn more money and pay it off so the Stratocaster became his partner for life if you like." ...|$|E
2500|$|Netanyahu defines {{capitalism}} as [...] "the {{ability to}} have individual initiative and competition to produce goods and services with profit, but not to shut out somebody else from {{trying to do the}} same." [...] He says that his views developed while he was working as an economic consult for Boston Consulting Group: [...] "It {{was the first time that}} the Boston Consulting Group looked at governments and worked for governments. They wanted to do a strategic plan for the government of Sweden. I was on that case and looked at other governments. So I went around to other governments in Europe in 1976 and I was looking at Britain. I was looking at France. I was looking at other countries, and I could see that they were stymied by concentrations of power that prevented competition. And I thought, hmm, as bad as they are, ours was worse because we had very little room for private sector competition to the extent that we had government-controlled or union-controlled companies, and so you really didn't get the competition or the growth... And I <b>said,</b> <b>well,</b> if I ever have a chance, I'll change that." ...|$|E
