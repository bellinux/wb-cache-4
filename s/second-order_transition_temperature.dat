40|$|Light-scattering {{measurements}} using {{circularly polarized}} {{light in a}} backscattering geometry are employed to measure the amplitude of fluctuations {{in two of the}} five structural modes present in the isotropic phase of chiral liquid crystals. From these measurements, the second-order transition temperatures for all five modes are then calculated. In order to investigate the effect of chirality on the fluctuations, the experiments are performed in various mixtures of the chiral liquid crystal 4 ’’-(2 -methylbutylphenyl) - 4 ’-(2 -methylbutyl) - 4 -biphenylcarboxylate (CE 2) and the nonchiral liquid crystal 4 -n-pentylbenzenethio- 4 ’-n-heptyloxybenzoate(7 ¯S 5). The results show that fluctuations in the five modes are independent in low-chirality mixtures, and, as predicted by theory, the second-order transition temperatures grow farther apart as the chirality increases. In highly chiral mixtures, fluctuations in the mode with the highest <b>second-order</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> deviate from the normal temperature dependence, resulting in a lower <b>second-order</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> for this mode. The probable explanation for this is that fluctuations in the structural modes are coupled in high-chirality systems, but at present no theoretical calculations exist...|$|E

40|$|Marginal Fermi-liquid physics near optimal doping in high T_{c} cuprates {{has been}} {{explained}} within two competing scenarios {{such as the}} spin-fluctuation theory based on an itinerant picture and the slave-particle approach based on a localized picture. In this study we propose an alternative scenario for the anomalous transport {{within the context of}} the slave-particle approach. Although the marginal Fermi-liquid phenomenology was interpreted previously within deconfinement of the compact gauge theory, referred to as the strange metal phase, we start from confinement, introducing the Polyakov-loop parameter into an SU(2) gauge theory formulation of the t-J model. The Polyakov-loop parameter gives rise to incoherent electrons through the confinement of spinons and holons, which result from huge imaginary parts of self-energy corrections for spinons and holons. This confinement scenario serves a novel mechanism for the marginal Fermi-liquid transport in the respect that the scattering source has nothing to do with symmetry breaking. Furthermore, the incoherent Fermi-liquid state evolves into the Fermi liquid phase through crossover instead of an artificial <b>second-order</b> <b>transition</b> as <b>temperature</b> is lowered, where the crossover phenomenon does not result from the Anderson-Higgs mechanism but originate from an energy scale in the holon sector.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{dissertation}} {{is to understand}} the structural and magnetic properties of the newly discovered FeAs-based superconductors and the interconnection between superconductivity, antiferromagnetism, and structure. X-ray and neutron scattering techniques are powerful tools to directly observe the structure and magnetism in this system: High-resolution x-ray diffraction, x-ray resonant magnetic scattering, and neutron diffraction measurements have been used. I found that the structural and antiferromagnetic transitions are split in the parent BaFe 2 As 2 compound with <b>second-order</b> structural <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> (TS) higher than the first-order AFM <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> (TN). Upon substitutions by Co and Rh, which are considered as electron doping, the structural and AFM <b>transition</b> <b>temperatures</b> are suppressed to lower temperature and split further. In contrast to the electron doping, in isoelectronic Ru substitution, the structural and AFM transitions are locked at the same temperature while in the hole doping case, the Mn substitution, the TS and TN occur at the same temperature up to approximately x = 0. 102. Above x ≥ 0. 11, the orthorhombic distortion is not observed while the AFM signal from the antiferromagnetic propagation vector QAFM of the “stripe” AFM structure remains. X-ray resonant magnetic scattering measurements at the Fe K edge add another example of resonance enhancement at the K edge of 3 d element (in this case Fe) and definitely show that no incommensurate magnetic ordering exists in ≤ 5. 4 % Co substituted BaFe 2 As 2 compounds. Neutron diffraction measurements show that the commensurate-to-incommensurate transition occurs in ≥ 5. 6 % Co substitution, ≥ 3. 5 % Ni substitution, but not in any level of Cu substitution. I show that simple electron counting based on rigid-band concepts is invalid. These results suggest that substitutional impurity effects in the Fe plane {{play a significant role}} in controlling magnetism and the appearance of superconductivity, with Cu distinguished by enhanced impurity scattering and split-band behavior...|$|R

The <b>second-order</b> phase <b>transition,</b> emerging under random bonds from the second-order regime of the pure model, has the same values of critical exponents as the 2 d Ising universality class, with {{the effect of the}} bond disorder on the specific heat being well described by double-logarithmic corrections, our findings thus supporting the marginal irrelevance of quenched bond randomness. On the other hand, the <b>second-order</b> <b>transition,</b> emerging under bond randomness from the first-order regime of the pure model, has a distinctive universality class with ν= 1. 30 (6) and β/ν= 0. 128 (5). This amounts to a strong violation of the universality principle of critical phenomena, since these two <b>second-order</b> <b>transitions,</b> with different sets of critical exponents, are between the same ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases. Furthermore, the latter of these two transitions supports an extensive but weak universality, since it has the same magnetic critical exponent (but a different thermal critical exponent) as a wide variety of two-dimensional systems. In the conversion by bond randomness of the first-order transition of the pure system to second order, we detect, by introducing and evaluating connectivity spin densities, a microsegregation that also explains the increase we find in the phase <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> under bond randomness.

40|$|We report {{systematic}} {{studies of}} the dc transport properties in proton-irradiated Y-Ba-Cu-O single crystals. We find that the onset of vortex dissipation in moderately irradiated samples {{is associated with the}} occurrence of a <b>second-order</b> vortex-solid melting <b>transition.</b> In addition, the decreasing zero-field <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> and increasing critical current density with the increasing defects reveal the effects of disorder on reducing the electron mean-free-path and on increasing the pinning density...|$|R
