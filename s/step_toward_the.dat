The transport logistics spacecraft, known as the TKS, was originally designed for the Almaz programme, and proved that large modules could dock automatically with space stations, a major <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> construction of multimodular stations such as Mir and the International Space Station.|$|E
5|$|In June 1970, Nasser {{accepted}} the US-sponsored Rogers Plan, {{which called for}} an end to hostilities and an Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory, but it was rejected by Israel, the PLO, and most Arab states except Jordan. Nasser had initially rejected the plan, but conceded under pressure from the Soviet Union, which feared that escalating regional conflict could drag it into a war with the US. He also determined that a ceasefire could serve as a tactical <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> strategic goal of recapturing the Suez Canal. Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender.|$|E
5|$|The {{book has}} also been seen {{as an attempt to}} redefine masculinity as a {{necessary}} <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> abolition of slavery. In this view, abolitionists had begun to resist the vision of aggressive and dominant men that the conquest and colonization of the early 19th century had fostered. In order to change the notion of manhood so that men could oppose slavery without jeopardizing their self-image or their standing in society, some abolitionists drew on principles of women's suffrage and Christianity as well as passivism, and praised men for cooperation, compassion, and civic spirit. Others within the abolitionist movement argued for conventional, aggressive masculine action. All the men in Stowe's novel are representations of either one kind of man or the other.|$|E

5|$|When President Lincoln finally {{issued the}} Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863, Tubman {{considered}} it an important <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> goal of liberating all black men, women, and children from slavery. She renewed her {{support for a}} defeat of the Confederacy, and before long she was leading a band of scouts through the land around Port Royal. The marshes and rivers in South Carolina {{were similar to those}} of the Eastern Shore of Maryland; thus her knowledge of covert travel and subterfuge among potential enemies were put to good use. Her group, working under the orders of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, mapped the unfamiliar terrain and reconnoitered its inhabitants. She later worked alongside Colonel James Montgomery, and provided him with key intelligence that aided the capture of Jacksonville, Florida.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to gas turbines, most other applications (including industrial) {{need to meet}} a less stringent set of performance requirements.

These tests successfully verified the shuttle's flight characteristics, an important <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> overall success of the program.|$|E
25|$|Modern historiography of Belgium {{began to}} appear in the later 18th century, as {{scholars}} moved beyond the chronicles of particular provinces, cities or leaders and relied on rapidly accumulating data. They wrote dissertations using the critical approach to particular historical problems. This development was sponsored by The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium and reflected Enlightenment influences—such as that of Voltaire—in exploring the history of the people. They pondered questions of causality. Their goal was building the blocks for a general history of the Austrian Netherlands, thus marking an important <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> creation of a Belgian national history.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} early {{treatment}} facilities for tuberculosis and leprosy was a hospital {{on the island}} of Själö (or Seili in Finnish) which was established on the 1624 and run by the church. It was chosen due to its remote location from the mainland. It was not however until 1759 that the first hospital, albeit a modest hospital, was established in Turku. Consisting of six patient beds in a simple wooden building, it nonetheless marked the first <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> modern Finnish medical system. It is noteworthy that at the time, Finland had a much lower doctor-patient ratio comparing to neighboring countries. This lasted all the way until the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} the Helvetic Republic is still very {{controversial}} within Switzerland. It represents {{the first time that}} Switzerland as a unified country existed and a <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> modern federal state. For the first time the population was defined as Swiss, not as members of a specific canton. For cantons like Vaud, Thurgau and Ticino the Republic was a time of political freedom from other cantons. However the Republic also marked a time of foreign domination and revolution. For the cantons of Bern, Schwyz and Nidwalden {{it was a time of}} military defeat followed by occupation. In 1995 the Federal Parliament chose to not celebrate the 200 year anniversary of the Helvetic Republic, but to allow individual cantons to celebrate if they wished.|$|E
25|$|The {{toppling}} of Rădescu's {{cabinet in}} February 1945 {{was a new}} <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> communization of Romania. Indicted as a crypto-fascist by the communist authorities, he escaped to New York City, where he helped form the Romanian National Committee. The surviving membership of the Crusade of Romanianism was also hunted down. According to aviator Ion Coșoveanu, who was for long a political prisoner of the Romanian communist republic, Stelists were a distinct faction among the anticommunist underground. Coșoveanu (quoted by writer Niculae Gheran) recalled that, once in prison, Crusade members used to bicker with Iron Guard rivals. Coșoveanu also notes that the Stelist faction accepted into its ranks the poet Radu Gyr, until discovering that he was informing on them for the Guardists.|$|E
