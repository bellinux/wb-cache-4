Such <b>small</b> <b>circles</b> provide tractable systems {{for the study of the}} structure, thermodynamics and molecular dynamics of closed-circular DNA. In the present article, we review the occurrence and synthesis of <b>small</b> DNA <b>circles,</b> and examine their utility in studying the properties of DNA and DNA–protein interactions.

In this paper, an algorithm of finding a <b>smallest</b> <b>circle</b> containing all the given points in a given point set is presented. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(|lg(d/R) |n), where R is the radius of the <b>smallest</b> <b>circle</b> and d is the smallest distance from the points of the set that {{are not on the}} circle to the circle. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Once the arc is struck, the welder {{moves the}} torch in a <b>small</b> <b>circle</b> {{to create a}} welding pool, the size of which depends {{on the size of}} the {{electrode}} and the amount of current. While maintaining a constant separation between the electrode and the workpiece, the operator then moves the torch back slightly and tilts it backward about 10–15 degrees from vertical. Filler metal is added manually to the front end of the weld pool as it is needed.|$|E
5|$|Senator McCarthy's {{first three}} years in the Senate were unremarkable. McCarthy was a popular speaker, invited by many {{different}} organizations, covering a wide range of topics. His aides and many in the Washington social circle described him as charming and friendly, and he was a popular guest at cocktail parties. He was far less well liked among fellow senators, however, who found him quick-tempered and prone to impatience and even rage. Outside of a <b>small</b> <b>circle</b> of colleagues, he was soon an isolated figure in the Senate.|$|E
50|$|CCL {{problems}} {{generally have}} 8 solutions. The solution {{of this special}} case is similar to CLL. The <b>smaller</b> <b>circle</b> is shrunk to a point, while adjusting the radii of the larger given circle and any solution circle, and displacing the line parallel to itself, according to whether they are internally or externally tangent to the <b>smaller</b> <b>circle.</b> This reduces the problem to CLP. Each CLP problem has four solutions, as described above, {{and there are two}} such problems, depending on whether the solution circle is internally or externally tangent to the <b>smaller</b> <b>circle.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>smallest</b> <b>circle</b> {{problem is}} the problem of finding the minimum radius of a circle {{containing}} a given set of [...] points in the plane. It satisfies monotonicity (adding more points can only make the circle larger) and locality (if the <b>smallest</b> <b>circle</b> for set [...] contains [...] and , then the same circle also contains [...] ). Because the <b>smallest</b> <b>circle</b> is always determined by some three points, the <b>smallest</b> <b>circle</b> problem has combinatorial dimension three, even though it is defined using two-dimensional Euclidean geometry. More generally, the smallest enclosing ball of points in [...] dimensions forms an LP-type problem of combinatorial dimension [...] The <b>smallest</b> <b>circle</b> problem can be generalized to the smallest ball enclosing a set of balls, to the smallest ball that touches or surrounds each of a set of balls, to the weighted 1-center problem, or to similar smaller enclosing ball problems in non-Euclidean spaces such as the space with distances defined by Bregman divergence. The related problem of finding the smallest enclosing ellipsoid is also an LP-type problem, but with a larger combinatorial dimension, [...]|$|R
