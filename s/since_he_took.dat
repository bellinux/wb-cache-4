Maddy decides to try for the position at Holby before making any decisions.|$|E
25|$|In Iran, where {{wearing the}} hijab is legally required, many women push the {{boundaries}} of the state-mandated dress code, risking a fine or a spell in detention. The Iranian president Hassan Rouhani had vowed to rein in the morality police and their presence on the streets has decreased <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> office, but the powerful conservative forces in the country have resisted his efforts, and the dress codes are still being enforced, especially during the summer months.|$|E

25|$|The Husker's went on {{to sweep}} the Texas Longhorn's that weekend, {{due in part to}} the {{dominant}} pitching that happened all weekend. The Husker pitching staff allowed just 3 runs in 33 innings of work (1 run Friday, 0 runs Saturday and 2 runs Sunday). During this 33 inning stretch, the Husker pitching staff also recorded 33 strikeouts with just 5 walks. This was the most strikeouts in a single weekend for Coach Erstad <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> over in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The PBA was {{purchased}} in March 2000 by former Microsoft executives Chris Peters (chairman), Rob Glaser, and Mike Slade, and its corporate headquarters {{were moved to}} Seattle, Washington. Together with CEO Steve Miller, a former Nike executive, they are recognized for rescuing the PBA {{from the brink of}} extinction. As of 2011, Geoff Reiss currently serves as the PBA's CEO and Tom Clark serves as Commissioner. These two assumed the shared CEO/Commissioner post that was held by Fred Schreyer <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> over for Miller in 2005.|$|E
25|$|On 17 April 2004, Rantisi {{was killed}} by the Israeli Air Force in an assassination, after they fired Hellfire {{missiles}} from an AH-64 Apache helicopter at his car. Two others, a bodyguard named Akram Nassar and Rantisi's 27-year-old son Mohammed, were also killed in the attack, and four bystanders wounded. Israeli army radio stated {{that this was the}} first opportunity to target Rantisi, without significant collateral damage, <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> the leadership of Hamas, alleging that he had surrounded himself with human shields since the killing of Yassin.|$|E
50|$|It {{also appears}} that Phraates have borne special affection toward Mithridates, <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> name of “Philadelphus” (transl. brother-loving) upon his coins. It {{must have been}} huge {{satisfaction}} {{to him that he}} was instantly able by his last act to consult for the good of his country, and to gratify his sentiment on which, evidently, he prided himself.|$|R

I see Sir Patrick Charteris's name there, and he, I ween, is of no churl's blood. The Douglas himself, <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> the matter so warmly, might lift Sir Patrick's gauntlet without soiling of his honour." ...|$|R

25|$|Fanshawe was {{strongly}} {{in favour of}} elastic defence, where a lightly garrisoned front line would delay an enemy attack, and then a strong counter-attack would recapture lost ground, and had been training 48th Division in this mould <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> command in 1915; the Italian theatre was the first opportunity to put this approach fully into practice. The 48th Division was attacked on 15 June 1918 by the Austrians at the Battle of the Piave River; {{in keeping with the}} plan, leading elements fell back and a counter-attack was organised, recapturing the lost ground and stalling the offensive entirely.|$|E
25|$|The FBI, which {{initially}} sent {{agents to}} help recover debris, investigated possible foul {{play in the}} crash. After a few days, the bureau determined that the crash was accidental, but only after following several criminal leads involving death threats. Wellstone had been receiving death threats <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> office; the FBI tapped his phone to locate the callers. Documents about the FBI's involvement in investigating Wellstone's death were not publicly released until October 2010. Government documents also indicated that the FBI had been following Wellstone {{before he became a}} senator, and included records dating as far back as his arrest at a 1970 antiwar protest.|$|E
25|$|On 21 January 2017, {{following}} {{the inauguration of}} Donald Trump as US President, the White House announced that May would meet the President on 27 January, making her the first foreign leader to meet Trump <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> office on 20 January. In a joint press conference, May indicated an interest in increased trade between the United States and the United Kingdom. She also affirmed a desire to maintain an American involvement in NATO. May was criticised by members of major parties, including her own, for refusing to condemn Trump's Executive Order 13769, {{as well as for}} inviting Trump to a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II.|$|E

25|$|<b>Since</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> {{care of all}} the prison's bodies, he {{had some}} {{influence}} with officials there. In 1942 they changed schedules so that executions took place at night; Stieve was able to persuade them to return to mornings so that he could process the bodies and tissue the same day. Claims that his influence {{went so far as to}} choosing the women's execution dates based on their cycles have been debunked, and other reports that he allowed SS officers to rape some prisoners in order to study sperm migration have not been substantiated and appear dubious (none of Stieve's papers mention sperm as a subject of inquiry); although Seidelman, who first reported this, insists it occurred. Nor, contrary to another report, did Stieve make soap from the remains of the bodies after they had been dissected.|$|E
25|$|While {{these early}} efforts in orchestrated merengue {{generally}} succeeded only in scandalizing their audiences, the political changes {{that occurred in}} the Dominican Republic {{over the next few years}} made a resurgence of the merengue possible. The resented North American invasion of 1916 seems to have made the general public more disposed to support autochthonous rhythms over imported ones, though the raucous rural accordion sound was still unacceptable to high-society tastes. Nevertheless, when Rafael Leonidas Trujillo took power in 1930, he imposed the merengue upon all levels of society, some say as a form of punishment for the elites that had previously refused to accept him. The soon-to-be dictator must also have realized the symbolic power of the rural folk music and its potential for creating support among the masses, <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> accordionists with him around the Republic during his campaign tours from the very beginning.|$|E
25|$|Led by Ma Ying-jeou, the Kuomintang made {{a resounding}} {{win in the}} three-in-one {{election}} held on 3 December 2005. The KMT gained six more seats in the mayoral/magistratical race, from eight seats in the last election, {{to a total of}} fourteen seats. Before the election, Ma swore that he would quit the chairmanship if his party could not win over half of the seats, which was a first for a KMT chairman. It was a decisive win for Ma Ying-jeou as well, <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> over the party chairmanship only 110 days before. In the election, the KMT won back the counties of Taipei and Yilan, and the city of Chiayi, which had been the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)'s strongholds for over twenty years. It {{was the first time in}} many years that the KMT regained popularity as far south as Cho-Shui River (Zhuo-Shui River).|$|E

Ryan has been rated 0% on the Planned Parenthood Action Fund Scorecard.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1977, Nelson {{discovered}} that Reshen had been filing tax extensions and not paying the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> over as his manager. In June, a package containing cocaine was sent from Reshen's office in New York to Jennings in Nashville. The package {{was followed by the}} DEA, and Jennings was arrested. The charges were later dropped, since Reshen's assistant, Mark Rothbaum stepped in and took the charges. Rothbaum was sentenced to serve time in jail. Impressed by his attitude, Nelson fired Reshen and hired Rothbaum as his manager. In 1978, Nelson released two more platinum albums. One, Waylon & Willie, was a collaboration with Jennings that included [...] "Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys", a hit single written and performed by Ed Bruce. Though observers predicted that Stardust would ruin his career, it went platinum the same year. Nelson continued to top the charts with hit songs during the late 1970s, including [...] "Good Hearted Woman", [...] "Remember Me", [...] "If You've Got the Money I've Got the Time", and [...] "Uncloudy Day".|$|E
500|$|... "Beyond Blunderdome" [...] {{was written}} by then-showrunner Mike Scully and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore, airing {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). It was Scully's first writing credit <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> over as showrunner for the show. In comparison with other episode scripts, the staff writers did not change much of the original writing. The plot revolves around Mel Gibson doing a remake of the 1939 film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Karma Waltonen and Denise Du Vernay analysed the episode and wrote in the book The Simpsons in the Classroom: Embiggening the Learning Experience with the Wisdom of Springfield that [...] "the episode is able to critique the practice of test screening, violence in film, and one of movies' favorite standards – the car chase", calling it [...] "a ridiculous parody of an action-film violence orgy". Staff writer Tom Gammill {{came up with the idea}} for the violent version of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and Gibson throwing his Senator badge away at the end of the film, is a reference to the ending of the film Dirty Harry from 1971. The idea for the set piece with electric cars at the beginning of the episode came from Kevin Nealon, who was a friend of former showrunner David Mirkin. One day, he came by and demonstrated his electric car for the writing staff.|$|E

2500|$|Cisneros {{took on the}} unenviable {{position}} to completely restructure the HUD bureaucracy. [...] His ability to make sweeping, innovative changes at HUD was hampered by deep budget cuts and elimination of some programs. The agency’s staff had been cut to 10,000 {{at the end of}} his term, from 13,500 <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> over. He consolidated offices, moved staff from headquarters to field offices and increased management training. He reduced the number of agency programs from 240 to 20. The most difficult job for Cisneros as part of this reform was changing the attitudes of employees, who were often resistant to improving service to their communities.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, the Bush Administration's EPA {{issued a}} Climate Action Report {{concluding}} that the climate changes observed over several decades [...] "are likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a reflection of natural variability". While the EPA report was initially hailed by some environmentalists critical of the Bush administration as a [...] "180-degree turn on the science" [...] reversing [...] "everything {{the president has said}} about global warming <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> office," [...] within days President Bush dismissed the report as being [...] "put out by the bureaucracy," [...] and reaffirmed his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol.|$|E

50|$|<b>Since</b> <b>he</b> <b>take</b> {{the control}} over his domains, Leszek's policy {{was based on a}} close {{cooperation}} with Casimir II the Just, whose interests in Masovia (after <b>he</b> <b>took</b> the title of High Duke in 1177) were represented by the magnate Żyron. A manifestation of good relations with Casimir II was the participation of Leszek in the war against Prince Volodar of Minsk, who in 1180 captured Brest, who belonged to Leszek's brother-in-law, Vasilko Iaropolkovich. After a long and exhausting war, Brest ultimately wasn't recovered, and Vasilko gave all the rights over this land to Leszek (the region was annexed to Poland only by Casimir II in 1191, after he deposed Mieszko III and took the title of High Duke).|$|R
