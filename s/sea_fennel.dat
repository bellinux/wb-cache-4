5000|$|Crithmum is a genus of {{flowering}} plant {{with the sole}} species Crithmum maritimum, known as samphire, rock samphire, or <b>sea</b> <b>fennel.</b> Rock samphire is an edible wild plant. It is found on southern and western coasts of Britain and Ireland, on mediterranean and western coasts of Europe including the Canary Islands, North Africa and the Black Sea. [...] "Samphire" [...] is a name also used for several other unrelated species of coastal plant.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>fennel</b> (Crithmum maritimum L.) is a {{perennial}} halophyte species typical of coastal ecosystems, used fresh in traditional cuisine and folk medicine {{due to its}} sensory properties and a good content of healthy compounds. Although considered as a promising biosaline crop, this halophyte is underutilized for commercial cultivation possibly due to a shortage of its consumer demand. For promoting a full exploitation of this species, a new food product was obtained by drying <b>sea</b> <b>fennel</b> using different treatments (air-drying, microwave-drying, microwave-assisted air-drying and freeze-drying). Water activity, essential oil content, chlorophylls, surface colour, colouring power and sensory evaluation were analyzed. All drying treatments allow to obtain a good water activity but significantly reduced the content of essential oils and chlorophylls. Freeze-drying and microwaving preserved the surface colour parameters more than other drying treatments, while freeze-drying gave the product the best colouring power. Based on sensory analysis, microwave-drying, microwave-assisted air-drying and freeze-drying showed the highest scores among the drying methods. Taken together {{the results indicate that}} microwaving and freeze-drying are optimal for preserving qualitative traits, including organoleptic properties, in dried <b>sea</b> <b>fennel</b> for food use. Furthermore, dried <b>sea</b> <b>fennel</b> can be usefully exploited in human food not only for its aromatic traits but also for its food colouring power like other plant derived natural colorants. It could be concluded that this underutilized crop could play a better role for making up a sustainable food production system...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>sea</b> <b>fennel</b> (Crithmum maritimum L.) is a {{wild plant}} {{from the same}} family of the parsley and celery, that {{is used as a}} fresh {{ingredient}} for many food preparations. In this work, some alternative culinary uses for this aromatic plant as a dried ingredient have been proposed. Therefore, two drying technologies were applied with the aim to obtain a new spice-colorant without chemical synthesis. The results are discussed in terms of visual quality, odor and taste of the dehydrated products. Moreover, the effects on the overall sensory properties of some dishes prepared using the two different types of this new spice are reported. The introduction of the dried <b>sea</b> <b>fennel</b> in gastronomy could increase the sensory appeal of some traditional dishes and support the creation of many new recipes...|$|E
50|$|The highest part of {{the island}} has thorn thickets, {{separated}} by grassy rides. The lowest land is saltmarsh, and there is also extensive rough pasture with brackish pools. Flora include <b>sea</b> hog's <b>fennel</b> and lax-flowered sea-lavender, and there are breeding birds such as shelducks and oystercatchers.|$|R
50|$|Peucedanum palustre (milk-parsley) is {{an almost}} glabrous {{biennial}} plant in the family Apiaceae. It is so called in English because of the thin, foetid, milky latex found in its young parts and is native to most of Europe, extending eastwards to Central Asia. Another English common name for the plant is marsh hogs fennel (hogs <b>fennel</b> (unqualified) and <b>sea</b> hogs <b>fennel,</b> by contrast, are common names of Peucedanum officinale, a perennial species in the same genus, found in drier habitats, but having similar medicinal properties).|$|R
50|$|On {{the cliffs}} of the Cap de Sant Antoni, the {{vegetation}} is characterised by plants adapted to {{growing in the}} fissures, cracks and sherves of the cliff, and able to withstand contact with salt water. In the areas closest to the <b>sea,</b> Marine <b>Fennel</b> and the everlasting flower, Helichrysum decumbens, can be found. As one {{moves away from the}} sea and the salinity decreases the valencian rock violet appears as well as cave scabius on the steeper slopes. On more level ground, diannic endemic plants can be found (the town of Denia takes its name from the cult to the Roman goddess Diana) such as the valencian rock violet and also diannic pitiusic vegetation (in reference to the nearby archipelago Pitiusas) such as rock thistle and valerian can be found.|$|R
40|$|The {{effective}} management of insect pests and vectors still represents {{a major challenge}} in current entomology. Culex quinquefasciatus Say is a key vector of lymphatic filariasis, Rift Valley fever, West Nile, St. Louis encephalitis and Western equine encephalitis virus. Recently, {{the importance of the}} eco-friendly control of C. quinquefasciatus larval population using plant-borne biopesticides, including essential oils (EOs), has been stressed. Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.) also known as tobacco cutworm, {{is one of the most}} destructive moth agricultural pests in tropic and sub-tropic regions. Despite the fact that <b>sea</b> <b>fennel</b> (Crithmum maritimum L., Apiaceae) is considered as a promising biosaline crop, its potential for commercial cultivation has not yet been exploited. Notably, it has been reported that in coastal marine environments insects stay away from <b>sea</b> <b>fennel.</b> This aromatic plant is endowed with secretory structures as ducts and vittae storing volatile compounds. In this study, the chemical composition of <b>sea</b> <b>fennel</b> essential oils from three different EO accessions, namely France (Brittany), Central and South Italy (Marche and Sicily regions) have been analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and their toxicity against larvae of C. quinquefasciatus and S. littoralis evaluated. Selected pure compounds from the essential oils mentioned above have also been tested. The essential oils showed notable variability in chemical composition, being dominated by dillapiole and -terpinene (French EO), limonene and -terpinene (central Italy EO) and thymol methyl ether and-terpinene (Sicilian EO). As found out, the significantly most efficient essential oils were obtained from the seeds and aerial parts of plants of the French region. For these EOs, LD 50 values were estimated as 62. 3 and 71. 7 μg/larva for S. littoralis, respectively, and LC 50 as 13. 7 and 15. 6 μl/L for C. quinquefasciatus larvae, respectively. gamma-Terpinene and myristicin were the most effective on C. quinquefasciatus larvae showing LC 50 values < 17 μl/L. Overall, these findings shed light on the insecticidal potential of C. maritimum EO against mosquitoes and agricultural pests, allowing to identify the most effective chemotype, and to stimulate cultivation of this species as a source of botanical insecticides...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to compare the effect of NaCl on growth, cell {{membrane}} damage, and antioxidant defences in the halophyte Crithmum maritimum L. (<b>sea</b> <b>fennel).</b> Physiological and biochemical changes were investigated under control (0 mM NaCl) and saline conditions (100 and 300 mM NaCl). Biomass and growth of roots were more sensitive to NaCl than leaves. Roots were distinguished from leaves by increased electrolyte leakage and high malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities, ascorbic acid (AA) and glutathione (GSH) concentrations were lower in the roots than in the leaves of control plants. The different activity patterns of antioxidant enzymes in response to 100 and 300 mM NaCl indicated that leaves and roots reacted differently to salt stress. Leaf CAT, APX and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were lowest at 300 mM NaCl, but they were unaffected by 100 mM NaCl. Only SOD activity was reduced in the latter treatment. Root SOD activity was significantly decreased in response to 300 mM NaCl and root APX activity was significantly higher in plants treated with 100 and 300 mM compared to the controls. The other activities in roots were insensitive to salt. The concentration of AA decreased in leaves at 100 and 300 mM NaCl, and in roots at 300 mM NaCl, when compared to control plants. The concentrations of GSH in NaCl-treated leaves and roots {{were not significantly different}} from the controls. In both organs, AA and GSH were predominating in the total pool in ascorbic acid and glutathione, under control or saline conditions...|$|E
