40|$|Effective nasal drug {{delivery}} is {{highly dependent on}} the delivery of drug from the nasal <b>spray</b> <b>device.</b> Atomisation of liquid spray occurs through the internal atomizer that can produce many forms of spray patterns and two of these, hollow-cone and full-cone sprays, are evaluated in this study to determine which spray pattern produced greater deposition in the middle regions of the nasal cavity. Past studies of spray particle deposition have ignored the device within the nasal cavity. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), two computational models of human nasal cavity model were reconstructed from CT-scans, where {{the difference between the}} two models was the presence of the nasal <b>spray</b> <b>device</b> accounting for the airway blockage at one of the nostrils. Experimental measurements from Particle Droplet Image Analyser (PDIA) were taken in order to gain confidence in determining the initial particle conditions for the computational models. An airflow field is induced through a negative pressure flow condition applied at the pharynx instead of constant flow rates at the left and the right nasal cavities. Subsequent airflow patterns and its effects on particle deposition, with and without a <b>spray</b> <b>device,</b> are compared. Contours and streamlines of the flow field revealed that the presence of a <b>spray</b> <b>device</b> in the nasal vestibule produced higher levels of disturbed flow, which helped the dispersion of the sprayed particles. Particle deposition was found to be high in the anterior regions of the nasal cavity caused by its inertia. Evaluation of the two spray types found that hollow spray cones produced more deposition in the middle regions of the nasal cavity. This paper also demonstrates the CFD methodology used, which can help in better understanding the design of future atomizers for nasal spray use...|$|R

40|$|Practical problem: Lettuce {{cultures}} are routinely pesticide-treated to avoid widespread infestation with aphids {{which are not}} tolerated by consumers. An automated identification of infestation events would allow for selective spraying which reduces the costs for pesticide treatments and levels of pesticide residues. Project objectives: We aim to identify suitable sensors and algorithms for the remote detection of aphid-infested lettuce plants and to develop an improved <b>spraying</b> <b>device</b> for small-scale application of pesticides. Both techniques will be combined in a tractor-borne setup for the selective spraying of aphid-infested lettuce plants. Expected results: We expect that the biotic stress response of lettuce plants to aphid infestation leads to altered spectral reflectance signatures of the lettuce leaves. Suitable sensors and algorithms will be selected to remotely detect aphid-infested plants. Furthermore, we will develop a custom designed spraying installation for individual plants by combination of high-precision valves and jets for small-scale application of pesticides. Results so far: In a first experimental approach, lettuce plants with different infestation intensities of the polyphageous potato aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae) were cultivated to do comparative spectral reflectance measurements. Furthermore, a detailed study of lettuce morphology and growth patterns was basis {{for the establishment of}} a technical test facility to develop the <b>spraying</b> <b>device.</b> Who will benefit: Farmers can reduce costs for pesticide treatments, and consumers benefit from products with lower pesticide residues...|$|E
