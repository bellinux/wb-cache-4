60|$|And {{there was}} Mary, {{determined}} that he shouldn't be a chump. And Nature, mind you, on Bobbie's side. When Nature makes a chump like dear old Bobbie, she's proud of him, and doesn't want her handiwork disturbed. She {{gives him a}} sort of natural armour to protect him against outside interference. And that armour is <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory.</b> <b>Shortness</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> keeps a man a chump, when, but for it, he might cease to be one. Take my case, for instance. I'm a chump. Well, if I had remembered half the things people have tried to teach me during my life, my size in hats would be about number nine. But I didn't. I forgot them. And {{it was just the}} same with Bobbie.|$|E
60|$|So saying, Balafre hastily departed, forgetting, in his hurry, {{to pay for}} {{the wine}} he had called for, a <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> {{incidental}} to persons of his description, and which his host, overawed perhaps by the nodding bonnet and ponderous two handed sword, did not presume to use any efforts for correcting. It might have been expected that, when left alone, Durward would have again betaken himself to his turret, in order to watch for the repetition of those delicious sounds which had soothed his morning reverie. But that was a chapter of romance, and his uncle's conversation had opened to him a page of the real history of life. It was no pleasing one, and for the present the recollections and reflections which it excited were qualified to overpower other thoughts, and especially all of a light and soothing nature.|$|E

60|$|Though I {{have been}} {{hitherto}} as cautious as I could, upon all occasions, most nicely {{to follow the}} rules and methods of writing laid down by the example of our illustrious moderns, yet has the unhappy <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> my <b>memory</b> led me into an error, from which I must immediately extricate myself, before I can decently pursue my principal subject. I confess with shame it was an unpardonable omission to proceed so far as I have already done before I had performed the due discourses, expostulatory, supplicatory, or deprecatory, with my good lords the critics. Towards some atonement for this grievous neglect, I do here make humbly bold to present them with a short account {{of themselves and their}} art, by looking into the original and pedigree of the word, as it is generally understood among us, and very briefly considering the ancient and present state thereof.|$|R

'The Frenchman hailed, {{could get}} no intelligible reply, and after ascertaining through his {{binoculars}} that the crowd on deck {{did not look}} plague-stricken, decided to send a boat. Two officers came on board, listened to the serang, tried {{to talk with the}} Arab, couldn't make head or tail of it: but of course the nature of the emergency was obvious enough. They were also very much struck by discovering a white man, dead and curled up peacefully on the bridge. [...] "Fort intrigues par ce cadavre," [...] as I was informed a long time after by an elderly French lieutenant whom I came across one afternoon in Sydney, by the merest chance, in a sort of cafe, and who remembered the affair perfectly. Indeed this affair, I may notice in passing, had an extraordinary power <b>of</b> defying the <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> <b>memories</b> and the length of time: it seemed to live, with a sort of uncanny vitality, in the minds of men, on the tips of their tongues. I've had the questionable pleasure of meeting it often, years afterwards, thousands of miles away, emerging from the remotest possible talk, coming {{to the surface of the}} most distant allusions. Has it not turned up to-night between us? And I am the only seaman here. I am the only one to whom it is a memory. And yet it has made its way out! But if two men who, unknown to each other, knew of this affair met accidentally on any spot of this earth, the thing would pop up between them as sure as fate, before they parted. I had never seen that Frenchman before, and at the end of an hour we had done with each other for life: he did not seem particularly talkative either; he was a quiet, massive chap in a creased uniform, sitting drowsily over a tumbler half full of some dark liquid. His shoulder-straps were a bit tarnished, his clean-shaved cheeks were large and sallow; he looked like a man who would be given to taking snuff--don't you know? I won't say he did; but the habit would have fitted that kind of man. It all began by his handing me a number of Home News, which I didn't want, across the marble table. I said [...] "Merci." [...] We exchanged a few apparently innocent remarks, and suddenly, before I knew how it had come about, we were in the midst of it, and he was telling me how much they had been [...] "intrigued by that corpse." [...] It turned out he had been one of the boarding officers.|$|R

2500|$|Other {{important}} or common causes <b>of</b> <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> breath include cardiac tamponade, anaphylaxis, interstitial lung disease, panic attacks, and pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac tamponade presents with dyspnea, tachycardia, elevated jugular venous pressure, and pulsus paradoxus. The {{gold standard for}} diagnosis is ultrasound. Anaphylaxis typically begins over a few minutes in {{a person with a}} previous history of the same. Other symptoms include urticaria, throat swelling, and gastrointestinal upset. The primary treatment is epinephrine. Interstitial lung disease presents with gradual onset <b>of</b> <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> breath typically with a history of a predisposing environmental exposure. <b>Shortness</b> <b>of</b> breath is often the only symptom in those with tachydysrhythmias. Panic attacks typically present with hyperventilation, sweating, and numbness. They are however a diagnosis of exclusion. Around 2/3 <b>of</b> women experience <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> breath {{as a part of a}} normal pregnancy. Neurological conditions such as spinal cord injury, phrenic nerve injuries, Guillain–Barré syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy can all cause an individual to experience <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> breath. <b>Shortness</b> <b>of</b> breath can also occur as a result of vocal cord dysfunction (VCD).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess a) the impact of {{accommodation}} problems and the role of various coexisting risk factors on respiratory symptoms in elderly population in England. b) the effect of comorbidities on each respiratory symptom and finally c) if poor respiratory function coexists with respiratory symptoms. METHODS: For the {{purpose of this}} study data from Wave II of English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) was used. A number of 7666 participants over 50 years of age took part in the Wave II. Phlegm, <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> breath and wheezing were selected for analysis. Each respiratory symptom was investigated separately in relation to accommodation problems, age, gender, smoking, BMI, physical activity, wealth, FEV 1 /FVC and charlson comorbidity index. RESULTS: Accommodation problems, smoking and the number of comorbidities are significantly correlated with increased occurrence <b>of</b> sputum, <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> breath and wheezing. Gender and increased age are significant risk factors for sputum (p< 0. 01) and <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> breath (p< 0. 01). Obesity is significantly related with wheezing and <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> breath (p< 0. 01) but not with sputum. The moderate and vigorous level of exercise is negatively correlated with <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> breath and wheezing (p< 0. 0 l). There is a significant negative correlation between the level of gross wealth and the reporting <b>of</b> sputum, <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> breathe and wheezing (p< 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Accommodation problems, smoking, the number of comorbidities and the level of gross wealth are significant risk factors for respiratory symptoms in elderly people. Obesity is a risk factor for wheezing and <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> breath but age and gender influence the prevalence <b>of</b> sputum and <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> breath. The respiratory symptoms in elderly are followed by airflow limitation...|$|R
