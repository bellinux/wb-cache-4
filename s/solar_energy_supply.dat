On daily to weekly timescales, high pressure areas tend to bring clear skies and low surface winds, whereas low pressure areas tend to be windier and cloudier.

Thus the seasonal variation of wind and solar power tend to cancel each other somewhat.

This version is from Kandor and {{is the head of}} Krypton's Military Guild, who becomes so {{dissatisfied}} with the planet's ruling council's decisions that he initiates a rebellion. He discovers that the scientist Jor-El stole The Codex, the key to genetically-engineering Kryptonians, and that his son Kal-El was born naturally (which is against Kryptonian Law as all Kryptonians are engineered to be more efficient). Angered, Zod fights Jor-El but loses. Zod manages to kill the scientist before he and his forces (called [...] "The Sword of Rao"), including his second-in-command Faora, are captured and sentenced to 300 cycles of somatic reconditioning within the Phantom Zone. Zod then cryptically warns Jor-El's widow that he will find their son. Krypton's core destroys itself, killing all Kryptonians. Thirty-three years later, Zod arrives on the planet Earth and extorts its people into handing over Kal-El (now going by the name Clark Kent) by threatening Earth's destruction. Zod reveals to Clark Kent how he and his team refit the Phantom Zone projector into the ship [...] "Black Zero", acquired a [...] "world engine" [...] device, scouted unsuccessfully for surviving Kryptonian colonies, and traveled to Earth after Clark Kent triggered the distress signal of the scout ship he found in the Arctic. He then reveals his plan to terraform the planet with the world engine and use The Codex (that Jor-El placed within Clark Kent's individual cells as a baby) to repopulate the world with genetically-engineered Kryptonians, which will kill all of Earth's indigenous life in the process. When Zod arrives at the Kent Farm and threatens Martha Kent for the location of the codex, Superman attacks him in a rage and defeats Faora and Nam-Ek in a destructive battle in Smallville, forcing them to retreat. Zod releases the world engine on Metropolis and over the Indian Ocean to begin terraformation, but Clark Kent (now dubbed [...] "Superman") destroys the device while the United States Military use Superman's modified ship as an airstrike device against Black Zero, creating a singularity that sucks all Kryptonians (save for Zod and Superman) back into the Phantom Zone, foiling Zod's plans. Enraged at the loss of his people, Zod engages Superman in an even, catastrophic fight throughout Metropolis and briefly in space; Zod's advantages, combat experience and training, are matched by Superman's superior adeptness to his powers and higher <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> (having grown up on Earth and therefore adapted to its atmosphere and conditions). Eventually, Superman gets the upper hand and subdues Zod, but the General prepares to murder a trapped family with his heat vision and claims he will never stop, forcing Superman to reluctantly snap Zod's neck to save the family, killing him.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We use dynamic {{optimization}} {{methods to}} analyze the development of solar technologies {{in light of the}} increasing scarcity and environmental pollution associated with fossil fuel combustion. Learning from solar R&D efforts accumulates in the form of knowledge to gradually reduce the cost of solar energy, while the scarcity and pollution externalities associated with fossil fuel combustion come into effect through shadow prices that must be included in the effective cost of fossil energy. Accounting for these processes, we characterize the optimal time profiles of fossil and <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> rates and the optimal investment in solar R&D. We find that the optimal rate of fossil energy supply should decrease over time and vanish continuously upon depletion of the fossil fuel reserves, while the optimal supply of solar energy should gradually increase and eventually take over the entire energy demand.

40|$|With {{a view to}} the {{potential}} role of solar energy as a global energy option, the presently known solar energy technologies are employed {{to contribute to the}} world energy supply. Such a global <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> system would evolve in stages of development, proceeding from local use of solar energy to regional and global systems. The initial stage would include local low-temperature applications for heating purposes, and the embedding of small amounts of solar electric generation capacity in the existing electric grids. Regional interconnections of solar electric power generation would be followed by increasing production of solar fuels in locations with favorable insolation, and by long-distance transport of these fuels. It turns out that much more needs to be known about the behavior of very large integrated solar energy conversion systems. Market penetration calculations indicate that it takes roughly five decades for a major source of energy to be developed and used on a truly significant scale. It therefore would be necessary to initiate large-scale deployment of solar energy perhaps 50 years or more before fossil resources are finally depleted...|$|E
40|$|So far, <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> {{has been}} viewed as only a minor {{contributor}} in the energy mixture of the United States due to cost and intermittency constraints. However, recent drastic cost reductions {{in the production of}} photovoltaics (PV) pave the way for enabling this technology to become cost competitive with fossil fuel energy generation. We show that with the right incentives, solar electricity can be cost competitive with grid prices in the US (e. g., 6 - 10 US¢/kWh) by 2020. The intermittency problem is solved by integrating PV with compressed air energy storage (CAES) and by extending the thermal storage capability in concentrated solar power (CSP). We used hourly load data for the entire US and 45 -yr solar irradiation data from the southwest region of the US, to simulate the CAES storage requirements, under worst weather conditions. Based on expected improvements of established, commercially available PV, CSP and CAES technologies, we show that <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> has the technical, geographical and economic potential to supply 69 % of the total electricity needs and 35 % of the total (electricity and fuel) energy needs of the U.
