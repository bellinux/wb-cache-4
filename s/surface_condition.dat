2500|$|LiH powder reacts rapidly {{with air}} of low humidity, forming LiOH, [...] and [...] In moist air the powder ignites spontaneously, forming {{a mixture of}} {{products}} including some nitrogenous compounds. The lump material reacts with humid air, forming a superficial coating, which is a viscous fluid. This inhibits further reaction, although {{the appearance of a}} film of [...] "tarnish" [...] is quite evident. Little or no nitride is formed on exposure to humid air.

40|$|Including {{information}} {{of the current}} road <b>surface</b> <b>conditions</b> can significantly improve the effectiveness of an AEB (automated emergency braking) system to avoid accidents or reduce the injury severity in rear-end crashes. A method to estimate the friction potential based on on-board sensor information is shown in this work. This work expands the scope of existing investigations on whether the accuracy needed for the warning and intervention strategies of AEB can be reached with the proposed method. First, the bandwidth of <b>surface</b> <b>conditions</b> investigated is extended by including low friction surfaces comparable to ice. Second, situations of changing <b>surface</b> <b>conditions</b> and wheel-individual <b>surface</b> <b>conditions</b> were evaluated.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the roles played by incoming and outgoing electrons in spacecraft surface and stresses the importance of <b>surface</b> <b>conditions</b> for spacecraft charging. The balance between the incoming electron current from the ambient plasma and the outgoing currents of secondary electrons, backscattered electrons, and photoelectrons from the surfaces determines the surface potential. Since <b>surface</b> <b>conditions</b> significantly affect the outgoing currents, the critical temperature and the surface potential are also significantly affected. As a corollary, high level differential charging of adjacent surfaces with very different <b>surface</b> <b>conditions</b> is a space hazard.
