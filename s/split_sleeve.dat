40|$|Many studies require {{undisturbed}} soil cores. Soil conditions vary widely, depending upon site characteristics; {{some of the}} more difficult conditions are encountred in such studies as canal seepage studies and dry rangeland. A minimum amount of shattering, compaction, or distortion is desired. In some areas, rocky soil makes sampling from a pit impractical, and mountain terrain restricts the sampling equip-ment to lightweight, portable devices. Swanson (5) noted that the Lutz-type sam-pler (4) caused sample disturbance, usually from the impact of the hammer while taking samples. Since the Swanson-type sampler, the Coile Sampler, (1) and many others employ the same techniques and require a pit to sam-ple deeper toils, the chances of:disturbance still exist. Experience indicated that the hammer-type sampler was undesirable for use in our studies and that a sampler that could be used where mountainous terraine prohibited the transportation of motor-driven samplers, such the Utah Soil Sampling Machine (3) ', was a necessity. The Snake River Sampler (fig. 1) consists of five basic parts: an outer spiraled steel casing, an inner <b>split</b> <b>sleeve</b> holder, a <b>split</b> <b>sleeve</b> sam-ple holder (which can be either brass or steel), an inner sleeve lock, and a spring steel cutting tip. The outer steel casing (fig. 2 -A) is four inches I. D. with the spiral extending to within %-inch of a removable spring-steel cutting tip. The inside bottom end of the steel casing is bevelled to form a seat for the <b>split</b> <b>sleeve</b> holder (fig. 2 -B). The <b>split</b> <b>sleeve</b> holder is a tube 12 and % inches with a %-inch ledge near the bottom as a seat for the 12 -inch <b>split</b> <b>sleeve</b> sample holder (fig. 2 -C).

40|$|Coldworking {{fastener}} holes is {{a mechanical}} method of strengthening materials by retarding crack growth around the holes. It expands the hole diameter {{by creating a}} radial plastic flow of material, thereby producing a large residual compressive stress zone around the hole. This zone, depending upon variables such as material and applied expansion levels, will extend approximately one radius {{from the edge of}} the hole. This zone acts as a barrier, retarding crack growth, thereby increasing the fatigue life of the part. In this paper the benefits of coldworking are discussed. Currently there are two fastener hole coldworking methods used widely, the <b>split</b> <b>sleeve,</b> and split mandrel processes. The <b>split</b> <b>sleeve</b> process utilizes a solid, tapered mandrel and an internally lubricated <b>split</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The sleeveless split mandrel process utilizes a hollow, tapered mandrel that is longitudinally slotted into quarters (making it collapsible). Details of each process are discussed. Coldworking research to date has been focused on either fatigue life enhancement, or stress zone measurements (both actual and computer simulated). Research of the differences between the <b>split</b> <b>sleeve</b> and split mandrel process has been very limited. West Coast Industries (WCI) has theorized that these differences are important in determining the correct process for a specific application. An example of the need for this process-application matching can be seen in the problems encountere...|$|E

40|$|<b>Split</b> <b>sleeve</b> Cold eXpansion (CX) is {{a common}} {{technique}} to enhance the fatigue behaviour of open holes as well as fastener holes in fatigue critical joints of aeronautical metallic structures. Many test evidences, in the past, have demonstrated the capability of cold expansion to provide fatigue life improvements, longer inspection intervals and a general increase of the operational lifetime of an airframe. Thus, for several decades, CX {{has been used to}} extend the fatigue life of highly loaded aeronautical components. However, the benefits introduced by the CX process are not usually considered in the design phase of an aircraft, also because the prediction of the crack propagation in 3 D residual stress fields is still challenging. The paper presents a dedicated numerical strategy, developed to solve the issues connected with the SIF evaluation and to model crack growth in a complex residual stress field. The numerical procedure is based on an integrated approach, which manages pre- and post-processing data of Finite Element Analyses, with ABAQUS software, by means of “ad hoc” Python and Matlab codes...|$|E
40|$|A {{recognized}} way {{of improving}} the fatigue resistance of a fastener hole is to introduce compressive tangential residual stress around it. This {{can be achieved by}} using a cold expansion method in which an oversized pin or ball is forced through the hole to produce a local plastic region surrounded by an elastic one. Once the pin or ball is removed allowing the elastic region to spring back it results in compressive tangential residual stress around the hole. In practise, however, it is found that such a cold expansion method creates a nonuniform residual stress distribution through the plate thickness and even tensile residual stress can be created at the entrance and exit faces. In this paper a new method of cold expansion is proposed. It uses a tapered pin with a mating tapered <b>split</b> <b>sleeve</b> and creates an almost uniform compressive residual stress around the hole as shown by FE method. Also, fatigue tests were carried out to verify that the method does significantly improve fatigue life. Finally the tangential residual stress distribution and fatigue life improvement of this new method were compared with those of a well-established cold expansion method and it was shown that the new method is more efficient in improving fatigue life...|$|E

The development of a predicting capability in this case remains still challenging, especially if the crack is located in regions with high stress gradients. For this purpose, a dedicated numerical strategy has been elaborated at UNIPI to solve the issues connected to the SIF evaluation and to model crack propagation in complex residual stress fields. The discontinuity has been modelled using both innovative methods (e. g. XFEM) and traditional approaches. A massive use of in-house Python codes has simplified and speed up the phases of model generation and data extraction.

40|$|The present PhD Thesis was {{developed}} in the framework of several Research Programs in which the Department of Aerospace Engineering at University of Pisa was directly involved, with the general aim to characterized the fatigue behavior of conventional and innovative joints typically employed in the production of aeronautical and aerospace structures. Correct predictions could obviously improve design of optimized structures, maintaining or increasing actual safety levels: but the separate or synergic effects of several parameters must be considered to correctly reproduce structure in-service behavior. The logic-flow adopted for each aspect analyzed in the present research had his origin on a consistent database of experimental data, ranging from general mechanical properties material characterization to strain gauge evaluations of associated stress fields, moving toward a more comprehensive description of the faced problem by means of Finite Elements simulations, to finally reach, by fracture mechanics codes, a generalized model. Attention was mainly focused on parameters characterized by a lack of information in literature or unsatisfactory prediction models. Among others aspects, the effect of Secondary Bending on conventional longitudinal fuselage joints was deeply investigated, bringing to a clear improvement of fracture mechanics software. Furthermore were analyzed different technologies capable of decidedly improve joint performance in a standard architecture. Processes as Interference Fit, <b>Split</b> <b>Sleeve</b> Cold Working, StressWave and ForceMate were demonstrated to significantly retard crack initiation and propagation in critical points, introducing beneficial stress fields. Besides currently great efforts are made by the aerospace International Community to investigate the possibility of replacing standard joining methodology by new technologies which are expected to provide considerable weight saving and cost reductions, incorporating integral structures in aircraft constructions. The more promising one, the “Friction Stir Welding”, was widely explored during the present activity in different aeronautical and aerospace applications, demonstrating to be a very robust and reliable process...|$|E
