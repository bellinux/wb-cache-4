Gutmann <b>says</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these tests were likely routine examinations, and some {{may have been}} designed to screen for the SARS virus. However, in several cases, the medical tests described were exclusively aimed at assessing the health of internal organs.|$|E

Wesker <b>says</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his lines from the game as well, and the fight between Wesker and Chris and Claire Redfield in the film is an almost shot-for-shot remake of a fight between Wesker and Chris and Sheva in Resident Evil 5.|$|E

Similarly, Keith Harris from Rolling Stone called it a [...] "rowdy party-starter" [...] and appreciated its word play reference to the 1988 N.W.A album Straight Outta Compton in the title. Entertainment Tonight's Sophie Schillaci declared it a [...] "fun track" [...] that stayed true to the singer's [...] "classic country roots". A staff member from WUSN enjoyed the recording, and claimed it would make anyone more excited for If I'm Honest, which was then unreleased. Regarding {{the subject matter of}} [...] "Straight Outta Cold Beer", Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic found Shelton to be [...] "rais a little hell". Robyn Collins from Radio.com created a list of the [...] "5 Best Songs on Blake Shelton's If I'm Honest" [...] and included [...] "Straight Outta Cold Beer".

[...] Like Babel Tower, A Whistling Woman touches on the utopian and revolutionary dreams of the 1960s.
