25|$|The modern RGB <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> {{technology}} for color CRT displays was patented by Werner Flechsig in Germany in 1938.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{limitations}} in the dimensional precision with which CRTs can be manufactured economically, {{it has not}} been practically possible to build color CRTs in which three electron beams could be aligned to hit phosphors of respective color in acceptable coordination, {{solely on the basis of}} the geometric configuration of the electron gun axes and gun aperture positions, <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> apertures, etc. The <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> ensures that one beam will only hit spots of certain colors of phosphors, but minute variations in physical alignment of the internal parts among individual CRTs will cause variations in the exact alignment of the beams through the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask,</b> allowing some electrons from, for example, the red beam to hit, say, blue phosphors, unless some individual compensation is made for the variance among individual tubes.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> design by RCA produced a workable solution for color television, albeit one with considerably less image brightness. Interest in alternative systems like the Telechrome or Geer tube faded by the late 1950s. The only alternatives to see widespread use were General Electric's slot-mask, and Sony's Trinitron, both were modifications of the RCA concept. All CRT-based methods have since been almost completely replaced by LCD television, starting in the 1990s.|$|E
40|$|Thin film {{thermocouples}} {{for measuring}} material surface temperature have been previously demonstrated on several material systems and in various hostile test environments. A well-developed thin film fabrication procedure utilizing <b>shadow</b> <b>masking</b> for patterning the sensors elements had produced thin films with sufficient durability for applications in high temperature and pressure environments {{that exist in}} air-breathing and hydrogen-fueled burner rig and engine test facilities. However, while <b>shadow</b> <b>masking</b> had been a reliable method for specimens with flat and gently curved surfaces, {{it had not been}} consistently reliable for use on test components with sharp contours. This work reports on the feasibility of utilizing photolithography processing for patterning thin film thermocouples. Because this patterning process required changes in the thin film deposition process from that developed for <b>shadow</b> <b>masking,</b> the effect of these changes on thin film adherence during burner rig testing was evaluated. In addition to the results of changing the patterning method, the effects on thin film adherence of other processes used in the thin film fabrication procedure is also presented...|$|R

25|$|Dot pitch {{defines the}} maximum {{resolution}} of the display, assuming delta-gun CRTs. In these, as the scanned resolution approaches the dot pitch resolution, moiré appears, as the detail being displayed is finer than what the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> can render. Aperture grille monitors do not suffer from vertical moiré; however, because their phosphor stripes have no vertical detail. In smaller CRTs, these strips maintain position by themselves, but larger aperture-grille CRTs require one or two crosswise (horizontal) support strips.|$|E
25|$|RCA used Valensi's {{concept as}} the basis of all of its developments, believing it to be the only proper {{solution}} to the broadcast problem. However, RCA's early sets using mirrors and other projection systems all suffered from image and color quality problems, and were easily bested by CBS's hybrid system. But solutions to these problems were in the pipeline, and RCA in particular was investing massive sums (later estimated at $100 million) to develop a usable dot-sequential tube. RCA was beaten to the punch by the Geer tube, which used three B tubes aimed at different faces of colored pyramids to produce a color image. All-electronic systems included the Chromatron, Penetron and beam-index tube that were being developed by various companies. While investigating all of these, RCA's teams quickly started focusing on the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> system.|$|E
25|$|In July 1938 the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> color {{television}} was patented by Werner Flechsig (1900–1981) in Germany, and was demonstrated at the International radio exhibition Berlin in 1939. Most CRT {{color television}}s used today {{are based on}} this technology. His {{solution to the problem}} of focusing the electron guns on the tiny colored dots was one of brute-force; a metal sheet with holes punched in it allowed the beams to reach the screen only when they were properly aligned over the dots. Three separate guns were aimed at the holes from slightly different angles, and when their beams passed through the holes the angles caused them to separate again and hit the individual spots a short distance away on the back of the screen. The downside to this approach was that the mask cut off the vast majority of the beam energy, allowing it to hit the screen only 15% of the time, requiring a massive increase in beam power to produce acceptable image brightness.|$|E
40|$|An intuitionistic {{method is}} {{proposed}} to design <b>shadow</b> <b>masks</b> to achieve thickness profile control for evaporation coating processes. The proposed method {{is based on}} the concept of the shadow matrix, which is a matrix that contains coefficients that build quantitive relations between shape parameters of <b>masks</b> and <b>shadow</b> quantities of substrate directly. By using the shadow matrix, shape parameters of <b>shadow</b> <b>masks</b> could be derived simply by solving a matrix equation. Verification experiments were performed on a special case where coating materials have different condensation characteristics. By using the designed mask pair with complementary shapes, thickness uniformities of better than 98 % are demonstrated for MgF 2 () and LaF 3 () simultaneously on a 280 [*]mm diameter spherical substrate with the radius curvature of 200 [*]mm...|$|R

5000|$|The red, green, {{and blue}} {{phosphors}} for each pixel are generally {{arranged in a}} triangular shape (sometimes called a [...] "triad"). For television use, modern displays (starting in the late 1960s) use rectangular slots instead of circular holes, improving brightness. The <b>shadow</b> <b>masking</b> technique uses raster scan.|$|R
2500|$|If the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> becomes magnetized, its {{magnetic}} field deflects the electron beams passing through it, causing color purity distortion as the beams bend through the mask holes and hit some phosphors of a color {{other than that}} which {{they are intended to}} strike; e.g. some electrons from the red beam may hit blue phosphors, giving pure red parts of the image a magenta tint. (Magenta is the additive combination of red and blue.) This effect is localized to a specific area of the screen if the magnetization of the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> is localized. Therefore, {{it is important that the}} <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> is unmagnetized. (A magnetized aperture grille has a similar effect, and everything stated in this subsection about shadow masks applies as well to aperture grilles.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Most color CRT displays, i.e. {{television}} sets and computer monitors, {{each have a}} built-in degaussing (demagnetizing) circuit, the primary component {{of which is a}} degaussing coil which is mounted {{around the perimeter of the}} CRT face inside the [...] Upon power-up of the CRT display, the degaussing circuit produces a brief, alternating current through the degaussing coil which smoothly decays in strength (fades out) to zero over a period of a few seconds, producing a decaying alternating magnetic field from the coil. This degaussing field is strong enough to remove <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> magnetization in most cases. In unusual cases of strong magnetization where the internal degaussing field is not sufficient, the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> may be degaussed externally with a stronger portable degausser or demagnetizer. However, an excessively strong magnetic field, whether alternating or constant, may mechanically deform (bend) the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask,</b> causing a permanent color distortion on the display which looks very similar to a magnetization effect.|$|E
2500|$|Color tubes use three {{different}} phosphors which emit red, green, and blue light respectively. They are packed together in stripes (as in aperture grille designs) or clusters called [...] "triads" [...] (as in <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> CRTs). Color CRTs have three electron guns, {{one for each}} primary color, arranged either {{in a straight line}} or in an equilateral triangular configuration (the guns are usually constructed as a single unit). (The triangular configuration is often called [...] "delta-gun", based on its relation to the shape of the Greek letter delta Δ.) A grille or mask absorbs the electrons that would otherwise hit the wrong phosphor. A <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> tube uses a metal plate with tiny holes, placed so that the electron beam only illuminates the correct phosphors {{on the face of the}} tube; the holes are tapered so that the electrons that strike the inside of any hole will be reflected back, if they are not absorbed (e.g. due to local charge accumulation), instead of bouncing through the hole to strike a random (wrong) spot on the screen. Another type of color CRT uses an aperture grille of tensioned vertical wires to achieve the same result.|$|E
50|$|Stencils {{are also}} used in micro/nanotechnology, as {{miniature}} <b>shadow</b> <b>masks</b> through which material can be deposited, etched or ions implanted onto a substrate. These stencils are usually made out of thin (100-500 nm) low-stress SiN in which apertures are defined by various lithographic techniques (e. g. electron beam, photolithography).|$|R

2500|$|Color {{convergence}} {{and color}} purity are {{two aspects of}} this single problem. Firstly, for correct color rendering {{it is necessary that}} regardless of where the beams are deflected on the screen, all three hit the same spot (and nominally pass through the same hole or slot) on the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask.</b> This is called convergence. More specifically, the convergence {{at the center of the}} screen (with no deflection field applied by the yoke) is called static convergence, and the convergence over the rest of the screen area is called dynamic convergence. The beams may converge at the center of the screen and yet stray from each other as they are deflected toward the edges; such a CRT would be said to have good static convergence but poor dynamic convergence. Secondly, each beam must only strike the phosphors of the ...|$|E

50|$|Doming is a {{phenomenon}} found on some CRT televisions in which parts of the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> become heated. In televisions that exhibit this behavior, it tends to occur in high-contrast scenes {{in which there is}} a largely dark scene with one or more localized bright spots. As the electron beam hits the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> in these areas it heats unevenly. The <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> warps due to the heat differences, which causes the electron gun to hit the wrong colored phosphors and incorrect colors to be displayed in the affected area.|$|E
50|$|The Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF) is {{appropriate}} for modeling non-flat surfaces, and has the same parameterization as the SVBRDF; however in contrast, the BTF includes non-local scattering effects like <b>shadowing,</b> <b>masking,</b> interreflections or subsurface scattering. The functions defined by the BTF at each point on the surface are thus called Apparent BRDFs.|$|R
40|$|Multitemporal land-use {{analysis}} {{is becoming increasingly}} important for the effective management of earth resources. Despite that, consistent differences in the viewing and illumination geometry in satellite-borne imagery introduce some issues {{in the creation of}} land-use classification maps. The focus of this study is settlement classification with high-resolution panchromatic acquisitions, using texture features to distinguish between settlement classes. The important multitemporal variance component of shadow is effectively removed before feature determination, which allows for minimum-supervision across-date classification. Shadow detection based on local adaptive thresholding is employed and experimentally shown to outperform existing fixed threshold shadow detectors in increasing settlement classification accuracy. Both same and across-date settlement accuracies are significantly improved with <b>shadow</b> <b>masking</b> during feature calculation. A statistical study was performed and found to support the hypothesis that the increased accuracy is due to <b>shadow</b> <b>masking</b> specifically. National Research Foundation[URL]...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} the fabrication of top-contact silicon <b>shadow</b> <b>masks</b> for organic field effect transistors (OFETs) using plasma deep {{reactive ion etching}} (DRIE). Over 50 parallel and interdigitated finger contact masks of 30 mu m thickness have been created on a single silicon wafer, with lengths spanning from 6. 5 to 60 mu m and channel widths varying from 1000 to 50 000 mu m. Unlike all other mask fabrication techniques to date, these <b>shadow</b> <b>masks</b> are inexpensive, reusable, have nanoscopically sharp edges and {{can be made with}} precise (nanoscale) control over various sizes and shapes.

40|$|Traditionally, {{fabrication}} {{processes to}} produce microelectrode arrays for neural stimulating electrodes have employed photolithography and a photoresist layer {{to produce a}} pattern on a substrate which subsequently has a metal layer deposited. The deposited metal layer is then used to create stimulating electrodes that will ultimately be {{in close contact with}} neural tissue. While the process enables accurate fabrication at a reasonable cost, the use of photoresist in the process presents a number of issues. Photoresist is a contamination risk with the potential for chemicals to be absorbed into the silicone, which will then subsequently be in close proximity to neural structures, introducing a risk of toxicity. In addition, due to the use of flexible substrates such as silicone elastomer, patterning of films greater than 1 μm thick can be difficult. Whilst an obvious solution would be to avoid using photoresist in the fabrication process, few alternatives have been systematically investigated. We investigated use of <b>shadow</b> <b>masks</b> fabricated from glass, brass and silicone elastomer, and exploitation of the natural tackiness of the silicone substrate for mask adhesion. All three mask materials attached well to silicone, but each presented differing degrees of difficulty during alignment and mask removal. Subsequently, thin gold films (∼ 20 nm) and thick platinum films (∼ 8 μm) were deposited on the silicone substrates using the <b>shadow</b> <b>masks.</b> We discuss the mask fabrication, pattern definition, the difficulties which arose, and the benefits of using <b>shadow</b> <b>masks</b> for the fabrication of medical devices. 5 page(s...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} to automatically detect and remove shadows {{in real world}} scenes from a single image. Previous works on shadow detection {{put a lot of}} effort in designing shadow variant and invariant hand-crafted features. In contrast, our framework automatically learns the most relevant features in a supervised manner using multiple convolutional deep neural networks (ConvNets). The features are learned at the super-pixel level and along the dominant boundaries in the image. The predicted posteriors based on the learned features are fed to a conditional random field model to generate smooth <b>shadow</b> <b>masks.</b> Using the detected <b>shadow</b> <b>masks,</b> we propose a Bayesian formulation to accurately extract shadow matte and subsequently remove shadows. The Bayesian formulation is based on a novel model which accurately models the shadow generation process in the umbra and penumbra regions.
