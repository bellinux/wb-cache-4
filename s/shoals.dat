5|$|On 8 September 1967, the {{electronic}} portion of Dyemarker was divided and the aerial, sensor-based portion was designated Muscle <b>Shoals.</b> On 1 June 1968, the aerial portion was redesignated Igloo White.

All resources for Dyemarker/Muscle <b>Shoals</b> were redesignated Duck Blind in April 1968, and in June 1968 Muscle <b>Shoals</b> outright became Duel Blade.

50|$|<b>Shoaling</b> {{preferences}} in banded killifish differ in <b>shoal</b> species composition, <b>shoal</b> size, and individual body size within the <b>shoal.</b> The shift in preferences is triggered by predatory stimuli. In {{the presence of}} predatory stimuli, a banded killifish individual will prefer the bigger conspecific <b>shoal,</b> but {{only as long as}} the <b>shoal</b> is homogenous in individual fish size. If the size of individual fish were different, they would join a <b>shoal</b> of similarly sized fish regardless of <b>shoal</b> size. This preference is maintained by predatory threat. Body size is a more significant determinant of <b>shoaling</b> preference than <b>shoal</b> size and species composition.|$|R

5|$|Many teleosts form <b>shoals,</b> {{which serve}} {{multiple}} purposes in different species. Schooling is sometimes an antipredator adaptation, offering improved vigilance against predators. It {{is often more}} efficient to gather food by working as a group, and individual fish optimise their strategies by choosing to join or leave a shoal. When a predator has been noticed, prey fish respond defensively, resulting in collective shoal behaviours such as synchronised movements. Responses do not consist only of attempting to hide or flee; antipredator tactics include for example scattering and reassembling. Fish also aggregate in <b>shoals</b> to spawn.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We studied <b>shoaling</b> {{behaviour}} in {{a species}} of fish (Garra barreimiae) from Oman. We compared two populations (a surface-dwelling and a cave-dwelling population) with different theoretical {{costs and benefits of}} <b>shoaling.</b> We measured the tendency to associate with a <b>shoal</b> of conspecifics. The stimulus <b>shoal</b> was confined to (1) clear Plexiglas cylinders in light, (2) wire-mesh cylinders in light, or (3) wire-mesh cylinders in darkness. The surface form exhibited a strong preference for the stimulus <b>shoal</b> during the experiments in light, but also in darkness, when only non-visual cues from the <b>shoal</b> could be perceived. The cave form did not show a preference when solely visual cues were available (Plexiglas cylinder). When non-visual cues from the <b>shoal</b> could be perceived (wire-mesh), the cave form did show a preference to associate with the <b>shoal,</b> but the <b>shoaling</b> tendency was considerably weaker than in the surface form. The <b>shoaling</b> tendency has probably been genetically reduced in the cave form...|$|R
5|$|Although still {{a minimal}} {{tropical}} storm at the time, the CPHC anticipated Neki {{to become a}} hurricane as it tracked northwestward. As such, they issued a hurricane watch for Johnston Island {{on the afternoon of}} October19. The following day, the hurricane watch was replaced by a tropical storm watch as Neki was no longer forecast to pass close enough to the island to produce hurricane-force winds. Later that day, a hurricane watch was issued for the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument for areas between the French Frigate <b>Shoals</b> and Lisianski Island. The following morning, a supplementary hurricane warning was issued for the monument for areas between the French Frigate <b>Shoals</b> and Nihoa. Additionally, the tropical storm watch for Johnston Island was discontinued. Early on October22, the hurricane watch for Lisianski Island to Marco Reef was replaced by a tropical storm watch. Several hours later, the CPHC discontinued this watch. Early on October23, as Neki weakened to a tropical storm, the hurricane warning for areas between the French Frigate <b>Shoals</b> and Nihoa was replaced by a tropical storm warning. The tropical storm warning remained in effect for more than a day before being canceled during the afternoon of October24.|$|E

For more than two hours Hotham's ship worked its way inshore until at 17:30 it was well positioned to open fire, unleashing its broadside on the wrecked Preneuse. By 17:45 it was clear that further resistance was futile and Lhermitte struck his colours. Preneuse had surrendered, but was likely damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids also exhibit both {{schooling}} and shoaling behaviours.

Unlike most other squid species, bigfin reef squids are rarely cannibalistic. <b>Shoals</b> can include animals of different sizes without the threat of larger members attacking and consuming the smaller members. Whether bigfin reef squids recognise each other individually still remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|Endeavour then resumed her voyage westward {{along the}} coast, picking {{a path through}} {{intermittent}} <b>shoals</b> and reefs {{with the help of}} the pinnace, which was rowed ahead to test the water depth.

5|$|Fishermen have {{traditionally}} used seabirds {{as indicators of}} both fish <b>shoals,</b> underwater banks that might indicate fish stocks, and of potential landfall. In fact, the known association of seabirds with land was instrumental in allowing the Polynesians to locate tiny landmasses in the Pacific. Seabirds have provided food for fishermen away from home, as well as bait. Famously, tethered cormorants {{have been used to}} catch fish directly. Indirectly, fisheries have also benefited from guano from colonies of seabirds acting as fertilizer for the surrounding seas.|$|E

40|$|<b>Shoaling</b> {{intensity}} in zebrafish Danio rerio {{is believed to}} vary throughout subjective day and night hours. This experiment examines long term variations in <b>shoaling</b> behavior. Adult zebrafish Danio rerio were maintained under a 12 : 12 LD cycle (with dim red light serving as reduced visibility during subjective dark hours), and their <b>shoaling</b> behavior was monitored every hours for a three-day period of time. Our results show that zebrafish perform <b>shoaling</b> behavior throughout subjective day and under reduced visibility conditions, although mean <b>shoaling</b> times during the light phase {{were significantly higher than}} mean <b>shoaling</b> times during the dark phase. However, on the 3 rd day of the experiment, mean <b>shoaling</b> times during the subjective night had increased and mean <b>shoaling</b> times during the subjective day had decreased. This shift in intensity was not seen on the first two days of the study, and may represent the influence of experience on the behavior of the test fish. We believe this study shows that <b>shoaling</b> behavior changes with light/dark cycles and that fish <b>shoal</b> even during reduced visibility conditions [Current Zoology 59 (6) : 754 – 760, 2013]...|$|R
