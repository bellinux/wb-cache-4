40|$|Most {{randomised}} {{clinical trials}} of cancer treatment include {{a few hundred}} patients or less. Recent <b>statistical</b> <b>papers</b> advocate that sometimes thousands of patients should be entered. In this paper I show that for certain types of cancer trials the 'thousands policy' is not required while for others it is desirable but not feasible. In the latter case other strategies should be considered, such as two-stage phase III studies or parallel studies leading to overviews. There is, however, an important subset of trials for which application of the thousands policy is both necessary and feasible. The key to progress lies partly in the achievement of greater recruitment rates in trails of common cancers and partly in greater inter-group collaboration...|$|E

The practical implication for authors is that more explicit consideration of diagram types might both clarify thinking and make later searching by other researchers easier.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{covariance}} matrix called Gini covariance matrix (GCM), {{which is a}} natural generalization of univariate Gini mean difference (GMD) to the multivariate case. The extension {{is based on the}} covariance representation of GMD by applying the multivariate spatial rank function. We study properties of GCM, especially in the elliptical distribution family. In order to gain the affine equivariance property for GCM, we utilize the transformation-retransformation (TR) technique and obtain an affine equivariant version GCM {{that turns out to be}} a symmetrized M-functional. The influence function of those two GCM's are obtained and their estimation has been presented. Asymptotic results of estimators have been established. A closely related scatter Kotz functional and its estimator are also explored. Finally, asymptotical efficiency and finite sample efficiency of the TR version GCM are compared with those of sample covariance matrix, Tyler-M estimator and other scatter estimators under different distributions.

The condition is given as {{a structure of}} the dispersion matrix of the error term.

Two related problems are also considered: equality between two residual sums of squares, and classification of dispersion matrices by a perturbation approach. Comment: 16 pages.

The aim is to construct a kind of "taxonomy" of the <b>statistical</b> <b>papers</b> by organizing and by clustering them in main themes. In this sense being identified in a cluster means being important enough to be uncluttered in the vast and interconnected world of the statistical research. Since the main statistical research topics naturally born, evolve or die during time, we will also develop a dynamic clustering strategy, where a group in a time period is allowed to migrate or to merge into different groups in the following one.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the modern {{microarray}} technology, biologists can now observe the simultaneous (joint) expression profiles of thousands of genes in a single experiment. The large volume of data generated from these experiment (many available on public Internet sites) has created tremendous opportunities for the statisticians to get involved in this exciting development and create appropriate statistical tools for analyzing these data. As pointed out recently by Terry Speed (2001 Joint Statistical Meeting, Wald Lecture III), the number of papers involving microarray data seems to be exponentially growing over the past few years. We have attempted to present an overview of some of the major statistical developments in this area. They include statistical clustering, normalization and correction for systematic bias, empirical Bayes testing of significance of differential gene expression, ANOVA models and exploration of relationships of expression levels between genes. The scope of such an overview is `partial' by nature because new and novel <b>statistical</b> <b>papers</b> dealing with statistical analysis of microarray data are being added to the literature at an increasing pace.

40|$|The Skew Normal (SN, hereafter) {{class of}} densities has posed several and {{interesting}} inferential problems. In particular, the maximum likelihood estimator of the shape parameter λ may take infinite values with positive sampling probability. To over-come these problems we propose an objective Bayesian approach, based on reference priors. We {{show that the}} reference prior for λ is proper when λ is the only parameter in the model; also, the reference prior for λ is marginally proper when location and scale parameters are added. This fact allows us i) to provide a coherent estimation strategy which can be justified also from a pure frequentist viewpoint, since the refrence priors are 2 nd order matching priors, and ii) to consider the regular version of the Bayes factor for testing and model selection purposes. In the last years we have experienced a dramatic increase of <b>statistical</b> <b>papers</b> dealing with departures from normality, {{especially in terms of}} skewness and tail be-haviour.

40|$|A {{group of}} four <b>statistical</b> <b>papers</b> has been {{published}} {{in this issue of}} Methods of Information in Medicine, all dealing with the problem of classification in different areas of application and at different levels. Classification, also termed class prediction, {{is one of the major}} challenges in many areas of application.

Some recent examples published in this journal include approaches for differentiating between malign, benign, and normal tissue in women undergoing digital mammography [9], the prognosis of patients after stroke [10], the prediction of pro-longed hospital stay in an intensive care unit [11], or the detection of glaucomas [3]. Although this task is very important for clinical routine, some of the classification rules perform so badly that they cannot be recommended to be used in any real life application [12]. As this task is important and since some classifiers show poor performance, scientists from many different disciplines have developed and still develop novel classifiers, new methods for variable selection and approaches for investigating the validity of the classification scheme.
