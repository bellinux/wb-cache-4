These documents indicate that Trump might have evaded paying taxes on {{as much as}} 916 million dollars in income at one time. Trump likely gave some of his creditors shares of his failing businesses to avoid taxes on {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars he was given in debt relief, which is illegal.

40|$|In a {{boat in the}} Great Fish River estuary, in South Africa´s Eastern Cape province, {{researchers}} {{gather around}} the screen of a laptop computer to watch a series of moving dots indicating the movements of fish beneath the water. Science (SAIAB) and the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA), are collaborating in a project using acoustic telemetry, or electronic tagging, to monitor the numbers and the behaviour of two species of fish - the spotted grunter and the dusky kob - as they migrate between the open sea and the estuary. The project´s findings {{will be used to}} promote more sustainable fishing practices {{in order to protect the}} estuary´s valuable resources. After being spawned at sea, spotted grunter fiction or science gone overboard? Neither - the researchers, from the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (Pomadasys commersonnii) and dusky kob (Argyrosomus japonicus) enter the nutrient-rich waters of estuaries where they spend the first few years of their lives. Here, juveniles of the two species are heavily exploited, both by local subsistence communities for food, and recreational fishers, to the extent that the sustainability of these fisheries hangs in the balance. Better resource management, based on knowledge of the population biology, habitat and migratory behaviour of the species, is essential. The project team aims to describe the movements of the fish, how long they spend at sea and in the estuary, and the timing of their migration between the two habitats. Answers to these questions will promote the sustainable development of the fisheries, and provide local and national authorities with the information they need to ensure an equitable distribution of the estuary´s resources among the different user groups. The telemetry equipment consists of a battery-powered acoustic transmitter (fish tag) that is either attached externally or surgically implanted. Each transmitter emits unique coded signals on a fixed frequency and allows several individual fish to be tracked simultaneously. The transmitted signals are retrieved in either of two ways. Stationary hydrophones (underwater data-logging receivers), suspended from buoys positioned in the estuary, are used to monitor the presence or absence of fish within a fixed reception range. Alternatively, the researchers use a hand-held hydrophone from a boat to track individual fish more closely. The signals are transferred to a laptop computer that converts the sound signatures into high-resolution spatial data indicating the position, and direction and speed of movement of each fish. Electronic tagging is an appropriate ICT tool for tracking migratory fish like the spotted grunter and dusky kob. In contrast with radio waves, for example, the acoustic (sound) signals are not hindered by the poor conductivity of the estuary´s salty water. The information collected using this technique also allows the research team to collate fishery catch data with calculations of fish movement trends, in order to assess how vulnerable the species are to localized depletion. The team further hopes to explore the effectiveness of various conservation strategies to protect juveniles, such as creating protected areas within the estuary. The project´s methods and findings could be applied far beyond the estuary - they may also assist in the development of sustainable fish exploitation strategies for various fishery sectors at national level. ´The techniques used in this initiative could also be applied to work we´re doing at Kosi Bay [more than 700 km away], where the main recreational and subsistence fisheries target the same species currently being studied on the Great Fish estuary´, <b>says</b> <b>Steven</b> Weerts, research assistant at the University of Zululand. ´Institutional collaborations of this nature are invaluable as they assist in the transfer of knowledge and skills, and help build local capacity. ´ In future, the team plans to combine biological and physical data obtained from the fish tags with remote sensing data about, for instance, surface temperatures of the sea and the estuary. They will then be able to establish the relationship between movements and behaviour of the fish to oceanographic processes. This would constitute the final major advance necessary to understand the distribution of migratory fish in relation to their changing physical and biological environments on daily and seasonal time scales. mailto:m. collett@ru. ac. za Margot Collett is communications manager at SAIAB.

40|$|The United States {{should let}} the International Criminal Court start work on Sudan, <b>says</b> <b>Steven</b> Freeland LATE LAST MONTH a United Nations Commission of Inquiry {{reported}} its {{findings on the}} situation in Darfur, Sudan. The Commission, comprised of a highly regarded former judge and several UN and non-governmental organisation officials, confirmed the scale of the horrors that are occurring on a daily basis in the region. It described in detail the countless indiscriminate attacks, acts of murder, rape and torture, destruction of villages and forced displacement being perpetrated largely against the so-called ‘African’ tribes by the government of Sudan and the Janjaweed militia. Based on its investigations, the Commission concluded that serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, amounting to crimes under international law, had taken place. Indeed, there are credible reports of more than 70, 000 people already having been killed and in excess of 1. 65 million others having been internally displaced {{as a result of the}} actions of the Janjaweed. These atrocities are continuing. During the early 1990 s, similar reports were forthcoming from both Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. In both of those cases, the UN failed to act in a timely fashion to avert the tragedies that followed. With those vivid images of death and destruction still fresh in our minds, one would have thought that the international community would respond quickly and decisively to avert a further tragedy in Sudan. Yet, even following the Commission’s report, it is not at all clear whether and how the UN Security Council will respond. How can this be? In the first instance, there are, unfortunately, many other distractions for the members of the Security Council. Obviously, the events in Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan, as well as the prospects for a rapprochement between Israel and the Palestinians, appear uppermost in the minds of the US at the moment. For other countries such as France and Britain, there are important issues to be addressed - the scourge of foreign debt, the tragedy of the Boxing Day tsunami, the challenges of climate change, the future of the Congo rainforests - particularly in the newly emerging spirit of concern for global issues that seems to have arisen from the World Economic Forum in Davos. Russia and China are currently preoccupied with important internal matters - Russia with growing calls of dissent levelled against the government of President Vladimir Putin and the ongoing crisis in Chechnya, and China in dealing with the complexities associated with its economic growth. Indeed, China is reluctant to agree to the imposition of stringent sanctions against Sudan - an important source of oil for the country - for its support of Janjaweed activities. Yet there is a further reason for a perceived lack of urgency to act. The UN commission concluded that although some individuals, including Sudanese government officials, may have acted with ‘genocidal intent’, the government of Sudan had not pursued a policy of genocide in Darfur. Without a finding that genocide had taken place, many countries will feel that they are under no obligation to devote political and tangible capital to the plight of the civilians in Darfur, even though acts amounting to crimes against humanity and war crimes have taken place. The definition of genocide stems from the 1948 Genocide Convention, and requires an intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a group based on national, racial, ethnic or religious grounds. Though it may not appear obvious, this is an extraordinarily high threshold to prove, and there have been very few convictions of individuals for genocide in the period since the convention came into effect. This has been partly due to the lack of political will by most countries to pursue in their court system individuals suspected of committing such crimes, though the conviction of Adolf Eichmann by the Israeli Courts in 1961 was an exception. Indeed, it would be a full fifty years from the date of the convention before the meaning of genocide would be examined by an international court. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, when dealing with a charge of genocide against Jean Paul Akayesu, the bourgmestre (mayor) of the Rwandan commune of Taba, concluded that the Tutsis did not fall within any of the four persecuted groups in the definition. Though the ICTR still convicted Akayesu by expanding the definition to ‘any stable or permanent group’ - an approach subsequently rejected in other cases - the case clearly demonstrates the need to ‘upgrade’ the entire definition of the crime of genocide to accord with the values that exist in 2005. In the absence of this approach, findings such as those pronounced by the UN commission will let countries and perpetrators off the hook. This sends entirely the wrong message regarding the role of international criminal law, which is to affirm that there are certain actions that cannot be allowed. However, even in the absence of a finding of genocide within the narrow terms of the convention, there is still a clear path towards accountability. The International Criminal Court, established in 2002 as a permanent court, has the jurisdiction to hear charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It has the infrastructure and expertise already in place to deal with the situation in Darfur. It is already undertaking similar investigations in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and may also soon be called upon to investigate events in the Ivory Coast. The Security Council can refer the situation in Darfur to the ICC under the terms of the ICC Statute. Many countries, including Australia, are calling for this to be done, and the commission itself has also recommended this course of action. Yet the US - which strongly opposes the ICC on the grounds that it fears ‘politically motivated’ prosecutions by the ICC Prosecutor - does not wish to do anything that may give the court any further legitimacy. Instead it proposes sanctions against Sudan - most likely to be vetoed by China - or the establishment of an ad hoc tribunal like the Yugoslav and Rwandan Tribunals. Yet this latter approach is fraught with difficulty. To set up a new tribunal would take time, money and require expertise. It also does not make sense given the existence of the ICC, particularly when the Security Council has already required the other two ad hoc tribunals undertake a ‘completion strategy’ by 2010. The US should support the call for the Darfur tragedy to be referred to the ICC. If it cannot bring itself to vote for such a referral, it could abstain in any Security Council vote and, at least in its own eyes, maintain some face. In the meantime, innocent civilians in Darfur will continue to be subjected to gross violations of their human rights. • Steven Freeland is senior lecturer in International Law at the University of Western Sydney and has recently been appointed as a Visiting Professional at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
