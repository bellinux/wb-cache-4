5|$|During the Song Dynasty, Beiyue Temple {{was used}} as an {{alternate}} site to make <b>sacrifices</b> <b>to</b> the Northern Peak, Mount Heng, one of the sacred mountains of Daoism. During this time, Mount Heng was controlled by the Liao Dynasty (916-1125). In order to maintain political legitimacy and receive Daoist support, Beiyue Temple was chosen by the Song Emperor as the location to make <b>sacrifices</b> <b>to</b> Hengshan. Even though the mountain was not controlled by the Song, they believed that a 'geomantic vein' that would direct their sacrifices could be cut through enemy-controlled territory and reach it.|$|E

5|$|Shamanism was the {{dominant}} {{religion of the}} Jurchen people of northeast Asia and of their descendants, the Manchu people. As early as the Jin dynasty (1111–1234), the Jurchens conducted shamanic ceremonies at shrines called tangse. There were two kinds of shamans: those who entered in a trance and let themselves be possessed by the spirits, and those who conducted regular <b>sacrifices</b> <b>to</b> heaven, to a clan's ancestors, or to the clan's protective spirits.|$|E

On one occasion, when Heracles was {{offering}} a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>to</b> Zeus at Olympia, he was annoyed by hosts of flies, {{and in order}} to get rid of them, he offered a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>to</b> Zeus Apomyius, whereupon the flies withdrew across the river Alpheius.

5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{regarded as}} foreign elements in Roman culture, {{music and dance}} had existed in Rome from earliest times. Music was customary at funerals, and the tibia (Greek aulos), a woodwind instrument, was played at <b>sacrifices</b> <b>to</b> ward off ill influences. Song (carmen) {{was an integral part}} of almost every social occasion. The Secular Ode of Horace, commissioned by Augustus, was performed publicly in 17 BC by a mixed children's choir. Music was thought to reflect the orderliness of the cosmos, and was associated particularly with mathematics and knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Apparently Constantine did not patronize Christianity alone. After gaining {{victory in}} the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312), a triumphal arch—the Arch of Constantine—was built (315) to {{celebrate}} his triumph. The arch is decorated with images of the goddess Victoria. At {{the time of its}} dedication, <b>sacrifices</b> <b>to</b> gods like Apollo, Diana, and Hercules were made. Absent from the Arch are any depictions of Christian symbolism. However, as the Arch was commissioned by the Senate, the absence of Christian symbols may reflect the role of the Curia at the time as a pagan redoubt.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his many other roles, the emperor acted as the highest priest in the land who made <b>sacrifices</b> <b>to</b> Heaven, the main deities known as the Five Powers, and the spirits (shen 神) of mountains and rivers. It was believed that the three realms of Heaven, Earth, and Mankind were linked by natural cycles of yin and yang and the five phases. If the emperor did not behave according to proper ritual, ethics, and morals, he could disrupt the fine balance of these cosmological cycles and cause calamities such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, epidemics, and swarms of locusts.|$|E

5|$|The Qing state's main shamanistic ritual was {{performed}} at the tangse by the emperor {{on the first day}} of the New Year. In the Shunzhi (1644–1661), Kangxi (1662–1722), and Yongzheng (1723–1735) eras, this ceremony was the emperor's first activity {{on the first day of}} the New Year, but sometime during the Qianlong era (1736–1796) it fell to the second rank after private <b>sacrifices</b> <b>to</b> the Aisin Gioro ancestors. Even with this somewhat diminished importance, these shamanic rites continued to the end of the dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Troglita now {{moved his}} army {{to confront the}} enemy, who were encamped at a plain called the Fields of Cato. The Moorish camp had been heavily fortified, and Troglita was {{reluctant}} to launch a direct assault. He therefore blockaded it, hoping that hunger would force the Moors to fight him in open battle. To further encourage them, he restrained his men, feigning a reluctance to fight. Troglita's plan worked: encouraged by <b>sacrifices</b> <b>to</b> their gods and hoping to catch the imperial army unprepared, the Moors attacked the Byzantine camp on a Sunday. The battle hung long in the balance, with many dead on both sides, but eventually the Byzantines gained the upper hand. At this point, Carcasan rallied his forces and launched a fierce counterattack, but was killed by Troglita himself. Seeing their leader fall, the Moors broke and fled. The battle was a resounding success for the Byzantines: seventeen of the Moors' principal leaders were dead, the Tripolitanian tribes were decimated and withdrew to the desert, and Antalas and his followers submitted to Troglita. Byzacena, Numidia, and Tripolitania were finally secured, and a period of peace was inaugurated that lasted for the next fourteen years, until 562.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} Nowe {{becoming}} a fully-fledged Knight of the Seal. During his first mission, Nowe begins {{to doubt the}} ethics of the Knights' methods, as the seals require human <b>sacrifices</b> <b>to</b> remain strong. During a second mission to ensure {{the protection of the}} seal in the District of Soul Flame, Nowe encounters Manah, who kills the guardian Zhangpo and destroys the seal. Manah is sentenced to be burnt at the stake, but uses her magic to escape. After returning from the mission, Nowe is poisoned by Gismor, who reveals to have killed Nowe's adoptive father Oror. Surviving and escaping with Legna, Nowe is pursued by the Knights, including Eris, who wishes to persuade him to return. Nowe and Legna eventually meet up with Manah and join her on her quest to destroy the seals and, in her mind, free the people from the Knights' oppression. On their way to the second seal, Manah shows Nowe the true horror of the Knights' oppression, fully winning him over. The two then fight and kill Lieutenant Hanch, destroying the seal in the District of Hallowed Water. After this, they are joined by Urick, a former Lieutenant of the Knights, to rout a group of bandits. Attacked by the Knights, they are unexpectedly saved by Caim, who is also working to destroy the seals and free his dragon Angelus from the pain of being the Goddess Seal. After taking down Lieutenant Yaha and destroying the seal in the District of Precious Light, Manah is captured by the Knights and sentenced to death. Nowe manages to rescue her and heads for the seal in the District of Shining Life, which was once guarded by Urick before he fled in fear when Caim attacked the district. Urick and Nowe face off against Caim, who mortally wounds Urick before being driven off. Urick dies content and the seal is destroyed.|$|E

40|$|Departures from pure self {{interest}} in economic experiments have recently inspired models of "social preferences". We conduct experiments on simple two-person and three-person games with binary choices that test these theories more directly than {{the array of}} games conventionally considered. Our experiments show {{strong support for the}} prevalence of "quasi-maximin" preferences: People <b>sacrifice</b> <b>to</b> increase the payoff for all recipients, but especially for the lowest-payoff recipients. People are also motivated by reciprocity: While people are reluctant <b>to</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>to</b> reciprocate good or bad behavior beyond what they would sacrifice for neutral parties, they withdraw willingness <b>to</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>to</b> achieve a fair outcome when others are themselves unwilling <b>to</b> <b>sacrifice.</b> Some participants are averse to getting different payoffs than others, but based on our experiments and reinterpretation of previous experiments we argue that behavior that has been presented as "difference aversion" in recent papers is actually a combination of reciprocal and quasi-maximin motivations. We formulate a model in which each player is willing <b>to</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>to</b> allocate the quasi-maximin allocation only to those players also believed to be pursuing the quasi- maximin allocation, and may <b>sacrifice</b> <b>to</b> punish unfair players. ...|$|R
