40|$|This study {{measures}} the economic consequences of information <b>security</b> <b>activities,</b> in general, {{and more specifically}} {{the market value of}} disclosures of information <b>security</b> <b>activities.</b> Since information <b>security</b> <b>activities</b> are primarily non-revenue generating, management tends to view them as the cost-of-doing-business, with no impact on firm value. Furthermore, managers are reluctant to share the details, because that {{they do not want to}} attract the attention of hackers. However, voluntary disclosures of information security can help reduce information asymmetry, which leads to belief revisions by investors, and hence corrects the misspecifications (if any) of the firm’s market value. In other words, voluntary disclosures of <b>security</b> <b>activities</b> are signaling mechanisms. The objective of this dissertation is to develop a taxonomy of disclosures of information <b>security</b> <b>activities,</b> and empirically test the value relevance of such disclosures. Based on a sample of 1, 637 disclosing firms, the empirical results provide support for the argument that voluntary disclosures of information <b>security</b> <b>activities</b> are value-relevant.

Part I summarizes the major restrictions on banks 2 ̆ 7 <b>securities</b> <b>activities,</b> emphasizing recent regulatory initiatives aimed toward expanding banks 2 ̆ 7 participation in the securities business. Part II examines {{the application of the}} federal securities laws to banks 2 ̆ 7 <b>securities</b> <b>activities.</b> (While banks enjoy some exemptions from the federal securities laws, they are subject to many of the most important provisions.) In addition, Part II sets forth the division of responsibility for administering the securities laws among the federal banking regulators and the SEC. Part III analyzes the current paradigm of regulation of banks 2 ̆ 7 <b>securities</b> <b>activities</b> and concludes that the current model combines elements of functional and institutional regulation in form. Yet, once actual bank <b>securities</b> <b>activities</b> are taken into consideration, the current model more closely resembles functional regulation and, therefore, can be designated 2 ̆ 2 the functional equivalent to functional regulation. 2 ̆ 2 Part IV evaluates the current model of regulation of banks 2 ̆ 7 <b>securities</b> <b>activities</b> using the conventional understanding of the goals of the federal banking laws and the federal securities laws. This Part concludes that, given the current dimensions of actual bank <b>securities</b> <b>activities,</b> the incumbent model provides an acceptable compromise between the benefits of the functional model and those of the institutional model. Part V considers the durability of our current system of regulation and proposals for reform which seek only to provide more pure functional regulation. Part V concludes that the current model will not endure in an era of expanded bank <b>securities</b> <b>activities</b> and financial market consolidation.

In Japan, the banking {{industry}} is divided into many segments, including short-term banking, long-term banking, trust banking, retail banking, wholesale banking, small business banking, and international trade banking. In addition, Japan has many types of banking organizations, such as regular banks (Futsa Ginkd), long-term credit banks (Chdki Shin 2 ̆ 7 y 6 Gink 6) 2 ̆ 7, trust banks (Shintaku Gink 6), a foreign exchange bank (Gaikoku Kawase Ginkd) 2, and credit unions (Shin 2 ̆ 7 y Kinko).

50|$|Young investors Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) accidentally {{discover}} a prospectus by Vennett, convincing {{them to become}} involved in the swaps, as it fits their strategy of buying cheap insurance with big potential payouts. Since they are below the capital threshold for an ISDA Master Agreement required to enter into trades like Burry's and Baum's, they enlist the aid of retired securities trader Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt). When the bond values and CDOs rise despite defaults, Geller suspects the banks of committing fraud. The three also visit the American Securitization Forum, where they learn that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has no regulations to monitor mortgage-backed <b>security</b> <b>activity.</b> They manage to successfully make an even more profitable payout deal than other hedge funds by shorting the higher-rated mortgage securities. These securities were considered highly stable and the banks were willing to sell swaps on them extremely cheaply. Geller and Shipley are initially ecstatic, but Rickert is disgusted, pointing out an impending economic collapse and the human effect that's going to come from it, in particular, the fact that when unemployment goes up 1%, 40,000 more people will die. The two are horrified, taking an emotional stake in the collapse by trying to tip off the press and their families about the upcoming disaster and the rampant fraud amongst the big banks. As the housing market begins to collapse, Ben, while on vacation in England, is able to sell their swaps, and points out that Europe is starting to feel the effects of the collapse. Ultimately, they make a profit of $80 million, but their faith in the system is broken.|$|E

It is indicated that some scholars refer liability and willingness to take risks to professionally important qualities of guards ? employees of private security companies. Thus, if liability is considered as absolutely positive professionally needed personal characteristics, then {{it is not so}} clear with readiness (predisposition) to take risks. Contradictory data on the impact of the predisposition to take risks on the effectiveness of professional activity is provided in the literature. Predisposition to take risks is often considered as a contraindication for private <b>security</b> <b>activity,</b> but it is also noted that the choice to take risks can be conscious, value conditioned decision, which guarantees effective performance of professional duties. During the conducted research the author has found out that the guards of private security organizations (hereinafter ? PSO) are characterized by the same level of desire for risk as people whose professional activity is not related to extreme situations. However, the structure of relationships between {{the willingness to}} take risks and liability of guards and employees of PSO, who are not related to <b>security</b> <b>activity,</b> is significantly different. Such components of the willingness to take risks, as the desire for thrills and the search for new experiences of the guards of SPO are caused by profound and holistic understanding about liability, understanding of its essence, commitment and integrity, manifested in carrying out duties aimed at the social environment, as well as experience of positive emotions while performing responsible tasks. Besides, the liability associated with a sense of duty, reduces non-adaptive commitment for difficulties. Another situation is observed talking about SPO employees not related to <b>security</b> <b>activity.</b> Facial understanding of liability, focus on personal well-being and existence of negative emotions while performing responsible tasks lead to the fact that SPO employees, who do not exercise <b>security</b> <b>activity,</b> have no willingness to take risks. ????????, ??? ????????? ??????? ???????? ???????????

40|$|Software {{security}} is {{an increasingly important}} part of software development as the risk from attackers is constantly evolving through increased exposure, threats and economic impact of security breaches. Emerging security literature describes expert knowledge such as secure development best practices. This knowledge is often not applied by software developers because they lack security awareness, security training and secure development methods and tools. Existing methods and tools require too much effort and {{security is}} often given less priority in the trade-off between functionality and security. This thesis defines a tool supported approach to secure software analysis and design. Possible vulnerabilities and their causes are identified through analysis of software specifications and designs, resulting in vulnerability cause graphs. The security modelling tool SeaMonster is extended to include <b>security</b> <b>activity</b> graphs; this technique is used with vulnerability cause graphs to model vulnerabilities and security improvement activities. A <b>security</b> <b>activity</b> graph is created to identify activities that keep the vulnerabilities from instantiating in the final software product. The activities in the <b>security</b> <b>activity</b> graph can be the use of security patterns. This way the above approach is used to find a security pattern as a countermeasure to a vulnerability, {{and can be used}} with the security pattern design templates implemented in a preliminary project. This is a way of providing coupling between security expertise and software developers to apply security knowledge in software development practice. The approach and tools are tested and demonstrated through a development case study of a medical patient journal system. The main contributions of this thesis are an approach to secure software analysis and design, an extension of the security modelling tool SeaMonster, a case study of the approach and tools that show how security can be incorporated in early stages of software development. The contributions are intended to improve availability of security knowledge, to increase security awareness and bridge the gap between software experts and software developers. </p...|$|E

50|$|From the model, one can {{conclude}} that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be {{only a small fraction}} of the expected loss (i.e., the expected value of the loss resulting from a cyber/information security breach).

The Gordon-Loeb model also shows that, for a given level of potential loss, the optimal amount to spend to protect an information set does not always increase with increases in the information set’s vulnerability. In other words, organizations may derive a higher return on their <b>security</b> <b>activities</b> by investing in cyber/information <b>security</b> <b>activities</b> that are directed at improving the security of information sets with a medium level of vulnerability.|$|R
