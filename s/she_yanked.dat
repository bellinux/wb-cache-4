5|$|Her {{journeys}} {{into the}} land of slavery put her at tremendous risk, and she {{used a variety of}} subterfuges to avoid detection. Tubman once disguised herself with a bonnet and carried two live chickens to give the appearance of running errands. Suddenly finding herself walking toward a former owner in Dorchester County, <b>she</b> <b>yanked</b> the strings holding the birds' legs, and their agitation allowed her to avoid eye contact. Later she recognized a fellow train passenger as another former master; she snatched a nearby newspaper and pretended to read. Since Tubman was known to be illiterate, the man ignored her.|$|E
60|$|The car backfired, slowed. <b>She</b> <b>yanked</b> {{the gear}} from third into first. She sped up. The motor ran like a terrified {{pounding}} heart, while the car crept on by inches through filthy mud that stretched {{ahead of her}} without relief.|$|E

5000|$|The film {{opens with}} the Stooges' mother (played by male actor Monte Collins) {{attempting}} {{to wake up}} her three boys without success. [...] "Get out of bed you lazy loafers!" [...] she screams to no avail. Finally, <b>she</b> <b>yanks</b> a rope that leads from {{the kitchen to the}} bed where the trio is sleeping soundly. This causes the bed to spin vertically until they are expelled.|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} chapter, the teacher chooses Ellen and Austine {{to go outside}} and clean the chalkboard erasers. Austine {{continues}} to ignore Ellen, who becomes so angered by this that <b>she</b> <b>yanks</b> on the sash on Austine's dress and rips it. Both girls end up in tears and, after learning that Otis was the culprit in the lunch line and that both of their mothers made them wear their dreaded woolen underwear that day, they mend their friendship.|$|R
5000|$|At the hospital, Mrs. Kennedy {{continued}} {{to wear the}} blood-stained suit, but she had removed her hat. William Manchester wrote in Death of a President: [...] "The Lincoln flew down the boulevard's central lane; her pillbox hat, caught in an eddy of whipping wind, slid down over her forehead, and with a violent movement <b>she</b> <b>yanked</b> it off and flung it down. The hatpin tore out a hank of her own hair. She didn't even feel the pain." [...] The whereabouts of the hat today are unknown, and the last person known to have had it - her personal secretary, Mary Gallagher - will not discuss it. Several people asked Mrs. Kennedy whether {{she would like to}} change her suit but she refused. When Lady Bird offered to send someone to help her, she responded: [...] Despite the advice of John F. Kennedy's physician, Admiral George Burkley, who [...] "gently tried to persuade her to change out of her gore-soaked pink Chanel suit," [...] she wore the suit alongside Vice President Johnson as he was sworn in on Air Force One as the 36th President of the United States. In the photograph of the ceremony (right) the blood stains cannot be seen as they were on the right-hand side of the suit. Lady Bird recalls that during the swearing-in: [...] "Her hair was falling in her face but was very composed ... I looked at her. Mrs. Kennedy's dress was stained with blood. One leg was almost entirely covered with it and her right glove was caked, it was caked with blood - her husband's blood. Somehow {{that was one of the}} most poignant sights - that immaculate woman, exquisitely dressed, and caked in blood." ...|$|E
50|$|The video (Directed by Agata Alexander) {{features}} Adelitas Way {{performing in}} a remote deserted area near a lake, when a mysterious woman appears from the depths. Frontman Rick DeJesus and the band perform the track with unbridled energy until DeJesus himself is ensnared by her beauty as <b>she</b> literally <b>yanks</b> his chain.|$|R
50|$|Shooting Star later {{helps the}} Initiative repel the Skrull invasion. She begins {{to succumb to}} a lethal gas used by the Skrull impersonating Yellowjacket, but is saved by the quick {{intervention}} of the super-speedster Whiz Kid (on the original script, <b>she</b> was <b>yanked</b> away in time by Great Lakes Avengers member Flatman) and recovers immediately.|$|R
50|$|Eric and Sandy {{go back to}} {{the house}} and get the matches that Sandy dropped earlier. Ida's son attacks, {{breaking}} down the door. Eric attempts to fight using a broken branch, but the mutant grapples with him and fatally breaks Eric's back; once it has killed Eric, it turns it attention to Sandy and chases her upstairs into his mother's bedroom, where Sandy wraps a blanket around her head and, playing Ida, convinces the mutant to leave his mother's bedroom. But when Sandy leaves the room, the mutant is there and pursues Sandy {{out of the house and}} to the boathouse. Sandy runs headlong into Carla at the boathouse and the mutant, close behind, grabs Carla and crushes her face and kills her. Sandy manages to lure the man into Ida's boathouse, which she sets on fire; Ida's son is severely burned in the blaze, but still manages to leap from the water and attack Sandy, chasing her up a hill where <b>she</b> <b>yanks</b> a sharp signpost from the ground and impales the mutant with it. As he dies, we finally see his burned and deformed face.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film three stars and noted [...] "The movie's {{interest}} {{is not in}} the plot, which is episodic and 'colorful,' but in the performances. Sarandon bravely makes Adele into a person who is borderline insufferable. Sarandon's role is trickier and more difficult, but Portman's will get the attention. In 'Anywhere But Here,' <b>she</b> gets <b>yanked</b> along by her out of control mother, and her best scenes are when she fights back, not emotionally, but with incisive observations." ...|$|R
5|$|Snow and the Huntsman walk {{together}} in the forest, and she sees through his disguise and correctly guesses that he was sent by the Queen to kill her. Snow flees, but as the Huntsman catches up with her, he finds her writing a letter, which she requests he deliver to the queen after she is killed. The Huntsman takes out his knife, but instead of killing her, he fashions a whistle out of a bamboo stick, telling her that it will summon help and then telling her to run. The Huntsman then returns to the queen with a deer heart, hoping that she will not know the difference. The queen asks him to read her the letter, which is an apology for past wrongs {{as well as a}} request from Snow that her stepmother rule the kingdom with compassion. The queen burns the letter and takes the box with the heart in it to store in her vault. When she cannot open one of her storage safes, it proves that the Huntsman lied to her; the heart is not human. The Queen has her guards drag him down to the vault and <b>she</b> <b>yanks</b> his glowing heart out of his body. She tells the Huntsman that from now on he will be her pet and will do her bidding forever, and if he ever betrays her, all she has to do is squeeze.|$|R
5000|$|Immediately {{following}} {{her role in}} that film, Raines was cast in the all-female war film Cry [...] "Havoc", made the same year. In 1944, she appeared as a pin-up girl in the June 2 issue of the GI magazine <b>Yank.</b> <b>She</b> starred {{in a series of}} big films including the film noir Phantom Lady, the comedy Hail the Conquering Hero, and the John Wayne western Tall in the Saddle.|$|R
50|$|In December 1977, Eichhorn {{met with}} John Schlesinger {{for the role}} of Lancashire shop-girl Jean Moreton in his wartime romance, <b>Yanks.</b> <b>She</b> {{convinced}} him she was British and he gave her a screen test and, subsequently, the part. Although Eichhorn then felt duty-bound to tell Schlesinger she was actually American, he insisted that she was his choice regardless of her nationality. Eichhorn won two Golden Globe nominations for her performance in Yanks: Best Actress and Best New Star.|$|R
50|$|The group becomes {{separated}} when Reese {{runs off}} with the camera, with Ryan being left alone. As he searches for Reese, he sees various things, such as a half finished plate of food, a cup of coffee, a hidden room with a mattress and bed frame, and {{what looks like a}} body hanging from above. When the group is reunited, they hear footsteps above them that stop above Cassidy. <b>She</b> is then <b>yanked</b> into the air by seemingly nothing, leaving her with burns on her neck that look like rope burns.|$|R
50|$|On May 24, 2012, Luke and Tracy {{discover}} Anthony Zacchara's {{dead body}} at the boat house. Luke and Tracy were both arrested for the killing of Anthony Zacchara. At the Haunted Star on June 21, 2012 Luke finds Heather Webber eavesdropping on him and <b>she</b> later <b>yanks</b> him with a beer bottle, causing him to fall down to the ground, where she later held him hostage at a shack in the woods. On July 23, 2012 Anna Devane finally finds him, but when she found him the shack was on fire. Later Heather shows up and knocks Anna out, then Anna strikes back by fighting her back and later put her in handcuffs. When Anna frees Luke from the fire, Heather pulls out a gun and aims at her. She pulls the trigger and Luke steps in the bullet's path, taking {{a shot in the}} shoulder. He is rushed to General Hospital in critical condition, and is gradually stabilized before undergoing emergency surgery.|$|R
60|$|She {{was still}} typing swiftly at five-thirty, the closing hour. The article was long; she {{had at least}} two hours of work ahead. Miss Moynihan came stockily to say good-night. The other stenographers fluttered out to the elevators. Their corner became oppressively quiet. The office-manager gently puttered about, bade her good-night, drifted away. S. Herbert Ross boomed out of his office, {{explaining}} the theory of advertising to a gasoleny man in a pin-checked suit as they waddled to the elevator. The telephone-girl hurried back to connect up a last call, frowned while <b>she</b> waited, <b>yanked</b> out the plug, and scuttled away--a creamy, roe-eyed girl, pretty and unhappy at her harassing job of connecting nervous talkers all day. Four men, editors and advertising-men, shouldered out, bawling over a rather feeble joke about Bill's desire for a drink and their willingness to help him slay the booze-evil. Una was conscious that they had gone, that walls of silence were closing about her clacking typewriter. And that Walter Babson had not gone; that he was sharing with her this whispering forsaken office.|$|R
50|$|Chains {{follows the}} life of a woman named Vichitra, and the story is narrated by Solitude. In the first act, Vichitra is shown as a vivacious sixteen-year-old who is much admired for her beauty. Vichitra falls in love with Adhvik, a young boy with Aspergers Syndrome. The love story comes to an end in the face of extreme {{reactions}} from Vichitra’s parents, and she is sent far away from her home. The second part showcases Vichitra, now in her middle age, as a mother, wife and daughter in law. Her days are monotonous and routine, but she finds her escape in the night when she dreams of being a dance diva under the spotlight. Her real and dream worlds start to merge, until one day <b>she</b> is <b>yanked</b> back when <b>she</b> starts hearing voices of her family beseeching her to return to her ‘real’ self. The final act presents Vichitra in her advanced age, fighting solitude. The show ends with Vichitra accepting Solitude as her lover and vowing to spend her life with him, even as her family and neighbours conclude that senility has caused her to reach the limits of sanity.|$|R
5000|$|Moran's brief {{career as}} a film actress began in 1942 with some uncredited roles in such films as Yankee Doodle Dandy (as [...] "the Pippirino", with whom George blows off a date to go with Mary). By 1943, {{she had become a}} popular pin-up girl and {{appeared}} on the cover of such magazines as <b>Yank.</b> <b>She</b> was given supporting roles in films, such as Old Acquaintance (1943) with Bette Davis, and Warner Bros. attempted to increase interest in her, promoting her along with Lauren Bacall as a new screen personality when they co-starred with Humphrey Bogart in To Have and Have Not (1944). The film made a star of Bacall, but Moran languished, and her subsequent films did little to further her career; this probably {{had something to do with}} Howard Hawks' decision to marginalize Moran in order to boost the screen presence of Bacall, excising some of Moran's scenes.|$|R
