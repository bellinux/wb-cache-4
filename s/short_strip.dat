25|$|The station house {{formerly}} had {{two more}} staircases leading to either eastern corner, {{as well as}} another staircase to the northwestern corner. In June 2011, they were replaced by the in-system transfer to the underground platforms, which added a new staircase to the former southeast corner of the intersection. As part of the project, a <b>short</b> <b>strip</b> of 45th Road between 23rd Street and Jackson Avenue was de-mapped, while the adjacent Albert Short Triangle was renovated.|$|E

It continues to serve residential neighborhoods until it meets Chenango Avenue {{near the center of the}} village, at which the surroundings transition from residential to commercial. NY412 ends one block later at a junction with NY12B (Franklin Avenue). College Street continues east from this point as part of NY12B.|$|E

40|$|The {{suspended}} plate antennas (SPAs) with <b>shorting</b> <b>strips</b> and slots {{are presented}} numerically and validated experimentally. Effects of narrow <b>shorting</b> <b>strips</b> on the impedance and radiation {{performances of the}} SPAs are studied. The symmetric use of <b>shorting</b> and feeding <b>strips</b> makes the SPAs structurally symmetrical, which is conducive to the radiation performance of the SPAs. Also, effects of narrow rectangular slots cut in the center or {{the edges of the}} plates are investigated. Cutting the slots reduces size, realizes dual-band operation, and improves radiation performance of SPAs...|$|R

2500|$|Operation of {{the airport}} was {{transferred}} to Fjellfly, but remained owned by the municipality. The airline took delivery of a Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer in 1963 and the following year established a scheduled service to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. Fjellfly was the only Norwegian airline to operate the Twin Pioneer, which was chosen {{because it was the}} only aircraft with a capacity of sixteen passengers able to land on the <b>short</b> <b>strip.</b> At its peak in 1965, Fjellfly operated fourteen aircraft. A scheduled services from Skien via Sandefjord Airport, Torp and Oslo to Hamar Airport, Stafsberg was established from 2 May 1967. The runway was extended to [...] and paved in 1970. This allowed Fjellfly to take deliver of a de Havilland Heron for use on their service. Mey-Air showed interest in operating out of Skien in early 1972. Fjellfly went bankrupt in 1972 and Mey-Air withdrew their interest in the routes.|$|E

60|$|Neither Molly nor {{her father}} had moved or spoken while Jimmy was {{covering}} the <b>short</b> <b>strip</b> of turf that ended at the stone steps of the house. McEachern stood {{looking down at her}} in grim silence. His great body against the dark mass of the castle wall seemed larger than ever in the uncertain light. To Molly, there was something sinister and menacing in his attitude. She found herself longing that Jimmy would come back. She was frightened. Why, she could not have said. It was as if some instinct told her that a crisis in her affairs had been reached, and that she needed him. For {{the first time in her}} life, she felt nervous in her father's company. Ever since she was a child, she had been accustomed to look upon him as her protector; hut, now, she was afraid.|$|E
60|$|Nas Ta Bega led {{at a brisk}} trot, and sometimes, {{on level}} {{stretches}} of ground, at an easy canter; and Shefford had a grim realization of what this flight {{was going to be}} for these three fugitives, now so unaccustomed to riding. Jane and Lassiter, however, needed no watching, and showed they had never forgotten how to manage a horse. The Indian back-trailed yesterday's path for an hour, then headed west to the left, and entered a low pass. All parts of this plateau country looked alike, and Shefford was at some pains to tell the difference of this strange ground from that which he had been over. In another hour they got out of the rugged, broken rock to the wind-worn and smooth, shallow cañon. Shefford calculated that they were coming {{to the end of the}} plateau. The low walls slanted lower; the cañon made a turn; Nas Ta Bega disappeared; and then the others of the party. When Shefford turned the corner of wall he saw a <b>short</b> <b>strip</b> of bare, rocky ground with only sky beyond. The Indian and his followers had halted in a group. Shefford rode to them, halted himself, and in one sweeping glance realized the meaning of their silent gaze. But immediately Nas Ta Bega started down; and the mustangs, without word or touch, followed him. Shefford, however, lingered on the promontory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:-Dual {{frequency}} {{operation of}} antennas {{has become a}} necessity for many applications in wireless communication systems such as GPS, GSM services operating at two different frequency bands and services of PCS and IMT- 2000 applications. Although there are various techniques to achieve dual-band operation from various types of microstrip antennas, there is no efficient design tool that has been incorporated with a suitable optimization algorithm. In this paper the cavity-model based simulation tool along with an intelligent fuzzy system is presented {{for the design of}} dual-band microstrip antennas, using multiple <b>shorting</b> <b>strips</b> placed between the patch and ground plane. Since this approach is based on cavity model, the multiport approach is efficiently employed to analyze the effects of the <b>shorting</b> <b>strips</b> on the input impedance. Then the optimization of the positions of <b>shorting</b> <b>strips</b> is performed via an intelligent fuzzy system, to achieve an acceptable antenna operation over the desired frequency bands. The antennas designed by this efficient design procedure were realized experimentally, and the results are compared. In addition, these results are also compared to the results obtained by the commercial electromagnetic simulation tool, FEM-based software HFSS by ANSOFT...|$|R
