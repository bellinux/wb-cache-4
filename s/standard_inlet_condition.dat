The inlet configurations included two circular pipes having the same diameter as the heated pipe but with lengths of 600 and 1200 mm, sharp-edge and bell-mouth.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{of current}} collector materials in MoltenCarbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC) is investigated. The essential aimsof this investigation were {{to study the}} corrosion behaviour ofdifferent materials, in varying cathode and anode MCFCenvironments, and to study the contact corrosion resistancesbetween the MCFC current collector and electrodes. For thesepurposes, pure iron, iron-chromium binary alloys and severalcommercial steels were investigated in molten carbonate meltswithin the pot-cell laboratory set-up. In addition, the contactcorrosion resistances, between an AISI 310 current collectorand two cathodes (NiO and LiCoO 2), were studied in a laboratory fuel cell. Post-tests were done to study the corrosion products formed atthe surfaces. In cathode environments, corrosion potential increased overtime as a protective corrosion layer slowly formed. Eventually,the potential reached a stable value close to the cathodeoperating potential. The main cathode reaction, as corrosionpotential increased, changed from water reduction to oxygenreduction. Corrosion rate under the operating cathode conditiondepended on the chromium content; the higher the concentrationof chromium, the lower the corrosion rate. The corrosion ratesof ferritic steels, with high chromium content, and AISI 310 were higher at the so-called outlet operating condition incomparison to the <b>standard</b> and so-called <b>inlet</b> <b>conditions.</b> Thecorrosion rate was higher {{at the beginning of}} the exposure,which resulted in a relatively fast corrosion layer growth thatslowed as the protective layer was formed. It was shown thatthe corrosion layers, formed on iron-chromium alloys, AISI 310 and ferritic high chromium-containing steels, consisted of twolayers. The outer layer was porous and iron rich, while theinner layer was quite compact and rich in chromium and/oraluminiumTherefore, the corrosion behaviour was dependent onthe corrosion layer structure at the metal surface. In anode environments, the beneficial behaviour of aluminiumin ferritic alloys, with high aluminium contents, was due tothe formation of aluminium oxide and/or lithium aluminium oxideat the surface. The corrosion rates at the standard and outletconditions were of the same order of magnitude, while thecorrosion rates at the <b>inlet</b> <b>conditions</b> were considerablyhigher. The lower temperatures and higher carbon dioxideconcentrations in the <b>inlet</b> <b>conditions</b> appeared to result in asurface layer deficient in aluminium. A modified theoreticalmodel was developed to evaluate the corrosion current densitiesfrom experimental polarisation curves or linear polarisationresistance measurements in anode environments. The fittingswere found to be very good. An experimental method was developed forin-situmeasurements of the contributions to the totalohmic losses at the cathode in a laboratory scale MCFC. Thecontact resistance between the cathode and current collectorcontributed quite a large value to the total cathodepolarization. The corrosion layer, formed between the LiCoO 2 cathode and AISI 310 current collector, wasiron-rich and more porous, and contained a small amount ofcobalt. This was deemed to consist of a two-phase oxide, whichresulted in a lower conductivity. The corrosion layer, formedbetween the NiO cathode and AISI 310 current collector, wasrich in nickel.

Inlet NO and propene concentrations could be up to thousands of vol. ppm, while the CO concentration could reach several volume per cent.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In many areas of aerodynamics the technique of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) has proved a practical way of modelling the unsteady phenomena in numerical simulations. Few applications are as dependent on such an approach as the prediction of flow within a gas turbine combustor. Like any form of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), LES requires specification of the velocity field at the inflow boundary, with much evidence suggesting the specification of inlet turbulence can be critical to the resultant accuracy of the prediction. While a database of time-resolved velocity data may be obtained from a precursor LES calculation, this technique is prohibitively expensive for complex geometries. An alternative is to use synthetic <b>inlet</b> <b>conditions</b> obtained from experimental data High-speed Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is used here to provide planar velocity data at up to 1 kHz temporal resolution in two test cases representative of gas turbine combustor flows (a vortex generator in a duct and an idealised combustor). As the data sampling rate is approaching a typical LES time-step it introduces the possibility of applying instantaneous experimental data directly as an <b>inlet</b> <b>condition.</b> However, as typical solution domain inlet regions for gas turbine combustor geometries cannot be adequately captured in a single field of PIV data, {{it is necessary to}} consider a method by which a synchronous velocity field may be obtained from multiple PIV fields that were not captured concurrently. A method is proposed that attempts to achieve this by a combined process of Linear Stochastic Estimation and high-pass filtering. The method developed can be generally applied without a priori assumptions of the flow and is demonstrated to produce a velocity field that matches very closely that of the original PIV, with no discontinuities in the velocity correlations. The fidelity and computational cost of the method compares favourably to several existing <b>inlet</b> <b>condition</b> generation methods. Finally, the proposed and existing methods for synthetic <b>inlet</b> <b>condition</b> generation are applied to LES predictions of the two test cases. There is shown to be significant differences in the resulting flow, with the proposed method showing a marked ii reduction in the adjustment period that is required to establish turbulent equilibrium downstream of the inlet. However, it is noted the presence of downstream turbulence generating features can mask any differences in the <b>inlet</b> <b>condition,</b> {{to the extent that the}} flow in the core of the combustor test case is found to be insensitive to the <b>inlet</b> <b>condition</b> applied at the entry to the feed annulus for the test conditions applied her...|$|R

40|$|In {{conventional}} vapor compression systems, electronic {{expansion valves}} (EXVs) {{are used for}} refrigerant flow control. Subcooled refrigerant enters the expansion device and is expanded to the evaporation pressure while the valve opening is modified to achieve the desired mass flowrate. The relationship between the <b>inlet</b> and outlet <b>conditions,</b> the opening, and the mass flowrate has been extensively studied, e. g. by Park et al. (2007) and appropriate empirical correlations have been developed. However, for certain operating conditions (e. g. low refrigerant charge) or applications that generally have two-phase <b>inlet</b> <b>conditions</b> (e. g. balancing valves used in a hybrid control scheme as proposed by Kim et al. (2008)), these correlations are not applicable, since even low inlet vapor fractions lead to a significant reduction of the valve mass flowrate at a given opening. This paper proposes a continuous correlation {{that can be used}} for both two-phase and subcooled valve <b>inlet</b> <b>conditions.</b> The benefit of the continuity is that there is a smooth transition between subcooled and two-phase <b>inlet</b> <b>conditions,</b> which is essential for control and simulation purposes. The new correlation employs the Buckingham-Pi theorem as proposed by Buckingham (1914). The selected dimensionless Pi-groups describe opening of the valve, subcooling, inlet and outlet pressures, driving pressure difference across the valve, inlet density, surface tension, and viscosity. The data that was used to determine the coefficients of the correlation was taken on a dedicated valve test stand, which was sized for the per-circuit capacity of a typical 5 -ton R 410 A heat pump and a 3 -ton R 404 A large room cooling system. The purpose of these tests was mainly to map the valves for the low pressure drops, high inlet qualities and large valve openings that occur when they are used as balancing valves in a hybrid control approach. Two commercially available valves of different rated capacity were tested. Due to the much higher valve capacity for subcooled <b>inlet</b> <b>conditions,</b> valve openings of less than 5 % occurred in that case. This led to an accuracy of the correlation for these points that is less than what typically can be found for correlations with subcooled <b>inlet</b> <b>conditions</b> in the open literature. However, for two-phase flow <b>inlet</b> <b>conditions,</b> the resulting RMS of 1. 0 g/s for the 8 -PI correlation is sufficiently small to use the approach for estimating the refrigerant mass flow and using the EXV as a virtual flow sensor. The limitations of this approach in practical applications, as well as possible applications in fault detection and diagnostics are shown for application as balancing valves within a 5 -ton R 410 A heat pump and a 3 -ton R 404 A large room cooling system...|$|R

The effect of using spatially varying turbulence scales as inputs is investigated; {{it is found that}} this has impact on both accuracy and affordability, and has prompted the algorithm implementation changes described in the paper. LES of a channel flow with a periodically repeating constriction was used as a test case. The accuracy of the present simulation using a streamwise periodic boundary condition (PBC) was first established by comparison with a previously published highly resolved LES study. Post-processed statistics from the PBC simulation were then input into a Digital Filter Generator (DFG) algorithm. Three time series were created using the DFG for subsequent use as LES <b>inlet</b> <b>conditions.</b> In the first, as well as inputting the spatially varying first and second moments of the velocity field over the inlet plane from the PBC simulation, the turbulence scales input into the DFG were chosen to be spatially uniform with values specified by an area weighted average across the channel inlet height. In the second and third time-series, the turbulence scales were allowed to change in the wall normal direction, their variation again being deduced from the PBC simulation. These various time series were then used as <b>inlet</b> boundary <b>conditions</b> for LES prediction of the same flow case. Analysis of the results and comparison to the PBC predictions showed that the use of spatially varying turbulence scales increased the accuracy of the simulation in some important areas. However, the cost of generating unsteady <b>inlet</b> <b>conditions</b> using the DFG approach increased significantly with the use of spatially varying turbulence scales.

40|$|Pulsating {{flow through}} bifurcations are of general interest. In {{the human body}} such flows are also very common; for example in blood vessels and the {{respiratory}} tract. The characteristics of the flow in arteries have been related {{to the process of}} atherogenesis, based on the observation that the initial manifestation of the process is observed at certain common locations, i. e., near bifurcations in vessels of certain size. Inspite of these observations there is no direct understanding between the flow itself and the pathological process. In fact, the flow itself is rather complex since it is unsteady and transitional. The paper considers both unsteady- and steady-flow through a three generation system of (non-symmetric) bifurcations. The geometry consists of a 90 degrees. bifurcation followed by two sets of consecutive symmetric bifurcations. The aim of the paper is to investigate the effects of the bifurcations on the flow and mass transport in such a geometrical configuration that is often found in physiological situations. Additionally, the effects of different <b>inlet</b> velocity <b>conditions</b> have been considered. The different <b>inlet</b> <b>conditions</b> are aimed at studying the sensitivity to variations of inflow conditions; variations found under normal physiological conditions.

At peak flow and further downstream in the system the effects are negligible. It is also found that over a cycle the mass flow distribution through the outlets can be affected by the <b>inlet</b> velocity <b>conditions.</b> The distribution of a passive scalar is not uniform but depends on the <b>inlet</b> <b>conditions</b> and the Schmidt number (i. e., molecular diffusion).
