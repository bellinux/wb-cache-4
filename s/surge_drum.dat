50|$|A {{surge tank}} (or <b>surge</b> <b>drum)</b> is a {{standpipe}} or storage reservoir at {{the downstream end}} of a closed aqueduct, feeder, dam, barrage pipe to absorb sudden rises of pressure, {{as well as to}} quickly provide extra water during a brief drop in pressure.|$|E
50|$|In {{hydroelectric}} generating stations, {{the water}} traveling along the tunnel or pipeline may be prevented from entering a turbine by closing a valve. For example, {{if there is}} 14 km of tunnel of 7.7 m diameter full of water travelling at 3.75 m/s, that represents approximately 8000 megajoules of kinetic energy that must be arrested. This arresting is frequently achieved by a surge shaft open at the top, into which the water flows. As the water rises up the shaft its kinetic energy is converted into potential energy, which causes {{the water in the}} tunnel to decelerate. At some HEP stations, such as the Saxon Falls Hydro Power Plant In Michigan, what looks like a water tower is actually one of these devices, known in these cases as a <b>surge</b> <b>drum.</b>|$|E
500|$|An upbeat Harrison {{song in the}} mould of [...] "What Is Life" [...] and [...] "You", [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long" [...] has {{regularly}} been {{singled out}} {{as one of the}} highlights of Living in the Material World. In his album review for Rolling Stone, Stephen Holden called the track [...] "a gorgeous, rollicking love song", while Billboard magazine listed it second among the album's [...] "best cuts", after the title track. In Melody Maker, Michael Watts wrote of the song's [...] "Spector touches", including [...] "a crashing two-beat on piano and a great <b>surge</b> of <b>drums,</b> straight from [...] 'Be My Baby'". While otherwise lamenting the overt religiosity of the album, Tony Tyler of the NME identified [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long" [...] as the best track, describing it as [...] "bright and hopeful" [...] with a [...] "memorable melody to commend it".|$|R
5000|$|... "Taking Chances" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim. Bill Lamb of About.com {{wrote that}} [...] "Dion's vocals are commanding and powerful." [...] He also said: [...] "The song opens the album and announces new directions in a truly exciting fashion," [...] {{though he was}} disappointed {{with most of the}} following songs on the album. Chuck Taylor of Billboard wrote about the song that [...] "it is destined for AC's top 10." [...] Sarah Rodman from The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "it builds from an acoustic strum into the kind of pleasant radio-ready crunch that Michelle Branch would recognize." [...] Tammy La Gorce of Amazon.com called it a [...] "hopeful, heartfelt track, which unfolds into an anthemic power ballad midway through, may be the best one." [...] Nick Levine wrote a positive review for Digital Spy, describing the song: [...] "It begins in surprisingly restrained fashion, with Dion crooning softly over a near-acoustic musical backdrop, but the soft rock bombast kicks in soon enough. The guitars <b>surge</b> tastefully; the <b>drums</b> thump like they belong on a Phil Collins solo record and Dion plays the banshee to perfection." ...|$|R
40|$|Optimization of {{a typical}} crude oil {{atmospheric}} distillation unit and reduction of energy conservation were carried out through modifying the implementation and change in the flash zone of the tower. A conventional procedure in such units involves the combination of liquid and vapor product of the prefractionation train <b>surge</b> <b>drum</b> upon introduction to the tower. However, it is theoretically illustrated and represented by simulation means that introducing the vapor feed into the upper stages of the distillation column separately can lead to an energy saving of 12. 6 [*]% in the condenser duty, an increased liquid-to-gas flow (L/G) at certain points of the column, and hence {{to a reduction in}} diameter and investment costs of new tower designs of approximately US$[*] 0. 7 [*]million[*]a– 1. The proposal can be put into practice without the need of additional equipments or additional cost of difficult rerouting the streams. An industrial case study of a steady-state crude oil distillation unit is given by simulation provision of AspenHysys™...|$|E
