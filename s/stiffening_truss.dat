25|$|From late 1941 onward, Professor Farquharson (as well as von Karman, who did {{his work}} at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California) {{continued}} to work on the new bridge design. By 1943, he was working in a specially-designed wind tunnel laboratory built on the University of Washington campus in Seattle. The facility was large enough to house a scale model of the completed bridge as long as , plus section models for further testing. After Farquharson confirmed that Gertie collapsed due to its excessive flexibility and the aerodynamic forces {{as a result of the}} flexibility in her span, testing was then done on designs drawn by Smith. All of the new designs would feature a deep open <b>stiffening</b> <b>truss</b> instead of a solid plate girder.|$|E
2500|$|Construction of the {{new road}} deck and <b>stiffening</b> <b>truss</b> of the 1950 span was {{conducted}} differently than had been done in Gertie's case. In 1940, the road deck was prefabricated in [...] long sections on the Tacoma tideflats, then barged to the site via tugboats and hoisted into place via gantry cranes installed on the main cable. When construction of the road deck began in early March, workers installed a Chicago boom high above the roadway level, upon which prefabricated <b>stiffening</b> <b>truss</b> assemblies each -by- were hoisted into place. After the deck assemblies were hoisted into place and finished, four traveling derricks were then lifted onto the completed deck sections. [...] After the traveling derricks (called [...] "layleg rigs" [...] by the crew) were assembled and readied, the deck was then assembled {{in a series of}} steps. On the new bridge, the <b>stiffening</b> <b>truss</b> featured a series of outer members called [...] "chords" [...] that formed {{the top and bottom of}} the <b>stiffening</b> <b>truss.</b> These were installed first, then the diagonal and vertical truss members on the sides were installed. Next, an [...] deep <b>stiffening</b> <b>truss</b> [...] "floor beam" [...] perpendicular to the length of the bridge was installed at intervals of [...] (the distance between suspender cables; they were installed at each vertical beam member in the <b>stiffening</b> <b>truss).</b> These floor beams, each [...] wide, would form the upper lateral stiffening mechanism in the deck itself. After the floor beams were installed, at alternate floor beam panel points a set of diagonal bracing struts were installed. Then, a series of lateral bracing struts were installed on the top and bottom of the road deck - that connected to the outer steel chords. Next, a series of eight [...] deep I-beam [...] "stringers" [...] were installed (positioned longitudinally). This was the final steelwork step involved, and the deck was soon raised [...] on each corner to attach the suspender cables and their [...] "jewels" [...] to the vertical <b>stiffening</b> <b>truss</b> members.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike Gertie, whose {{preassembled}} deck {{sections were}} first raised into {{place at the}} center of the main span and the ends of the sidespans, on the new bridge the <b>stiffening</b> <b>truss</b> was erected first at each tower, and then progressed outwards. Four work crews, one on each side span and two on the main span (one each side) worked together completing each step in [...] intervals (completing an average of [...] of steelwork per day). The side span crews worked towards shore and the main span crews worked towards each other, and by May 1949, work was nearing completion. On May 28, ironworkers installed the closing top chord on the main span, and over the next two days workers finished closing the span up. On June 1, the steel <b>stiffening</b> <b>truss</b> of the road deck was declared complete.|$|E
50|$|The Bronx Whitestone Bridge, {{which is}} of similar design to the 1940 Tacoma Narrows Bridge, was {{reinforced}} shortly after the collapse. Fourteen-foot-high (4.3 m) steel trusses were installed {{on both sides of}} the deck in 1943 to weigh down and stiffen the bridge in an effort to reduce oscillation. In 2003, the <b>stiffening</b> <b>trusses</b> were removed and aerodynamic fiberglass fairings were installed along both sides of the road deck.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} 3,000 ft long with a {{clearance}} of 135 ft above the Hudson. At opening, {{it was the}} sixth-longest suspension bridge in the world. The chief engineer was Polish immigrant Ralph Modjeski, who had previously engineered the strengthening of the nearby Poughkeepsie Railroad bridge. Primary contractor was the American Bridge Company of Ambridge, Pennsylvania with steel from Carnegie. The span is unusual in that <b>stiffening</b> <b>trusses</b> were intentionally constructed on top of, not below, the deck.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} 2040 ft long {{with a clear}} center span of 800 ft between towers. It had two 350 ft side spans and carries a 20 ft wide roadway with two 3+1/2 ft sidewalks. It used <b>stiffening</b> <b>trusses</b> that are 9 ft deep. Each of the main {{suspender}} cables were 9+5/8 in in diameter, and consisted of 37 strands of 37 wires. The deck was 135 ft above water level to allow passage of large ships. The {{total cost of the}} span was less than $850,000 in 1931 dollars (about $12 million in 2010 dollars), significantly under its allocated budget.|$|R
2500|$|Designer Othmar Ammann {{had several}} {{plans for the}} bridge that would keep {{construction}} on its tight schedule. The two [...] towers were constructed in a short 18 days and {{were the first to}} have no diagonal cross bracing. Unlike other suspension bridges, the Whitestone Bridge did not have a <b>stiffening</b> <b>truss</b> system. Instead, [...] I-beam girders gave the bridge an art deco streamlined appearance.|$|E
2500|$|Robert E. Drake, who {{had been}} {{employed}} by the Woodworth Company was busy {{with a group of}} men doing cable work at the west anchorage. His death was due the breaking of a cable on a derrick, which sent the boom directly on top of him. The second death, on April 7, 1950, was that of 36-year-old ironworker Lawrence S. Gale. His death was due to a temporary weld failure at a lower chord cross strut at panel 33. It was Gale's {{first day on the job}} building the <b>stiffening</b> <b>truss</b> work, and he had noticed a weld that didn't look right. He was going to repair the weld, when it broke. He plunged [...] into the Narrows, along with [...] of steel. A memorial was held on a scow.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design of}} the Mackinac Bridge was {{directly}} influenced by the lessons from the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which failed in 1940 because of its instability in high winds. Three years after that disaster, Steinman had published a theoretical analysis of suspension-bridge stability problems, which recommended that future bridge designs include deep stiffening trusses to support the bridge deck and an open-grid roadway to reduce its wind resistance. Both of these features were incorporated into the {{design of the}} Mackinac Bridge. The <b>stiffening</b> <b>truss</b> is open to reduce wind resistance. The road deck is shaped as an airfoil to provide lift in a cross wind, and the center two lanes are open grid to allow vertical (upward) air flow, which fairly precisely cancels the lift, making the roadway stable in design in winds of up to [...]|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in 2015 {{another major}} {{renovation}} of the bridge started which saw the temporary removal of the pedway and bike lanes. At a cost of $150 million, every piece of steel that makes up the suspended spans, except the towers and two main cables, were replaced; the non-suspended approach spans remained. New vertical cables were required due to the relocation of the <b>stiffening</b> <b>trusses</b> from above deck level to below deck level. Construction mostly occurred overnight with the bridge open to traffic during the day, but many full-weekend closures were necessary. the replacement portion {{of the project was}} completed in February 2017.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{bridge is}} a {{stiffened}} suspension structure of an uncommon type, inasmuch {{as the main}} cables, after leaving the towers, are carried upwards to an anchorage in the sandstone cliffs above the bridge, instead of downwards, as is usually the case. The main span is of 226 ft feet centres, carried by suspension rods from the cables, {{of which there are}} fourteen {{on either side of the}} bridge. The cables have socketed end connections secured to steel girders in anchorages cut out of the solid rock and accessible for inspection. The <b>stiffening</b> <b>trusses</b> are of steel, hinged at the towers and also at the centre, to allow for the rise and fall of the cables due to temperature changes. The roadway is of timber planking, 15 ft feet wide between kerbs, carried on timber stringers and cross girders. In addition to the main span there are seven timber approach spans, built on a curve to meet the roadway on either side of the river. The approaches include a considerable retaining wall on the Maldon side. The materials required have been supplied under various contracts. The cables were imported, the steel and ironwork in <b>stiffening</b> <b>trusses</b> etc. manufactured by Clyde Engineering Company, and the timber supplied by various firms. The erection of the structure has been carried out by day labour, under Inspector James McCall, of the Public Works Department. The total cost, including contracts mentioned above and road work in approaches, was £8000." ...|$|R
40|$|A deployable, tension wire <b>stiffened,</b> <b>truss</b> column {{configuration}} {{was considered}} for space structure applications. An analytical procedure, developed for {{design of the}} truss column and exercised in numerical studies, was based on equivalent beam stiffness coefficients in the classical analysis for an initially imperfect beam column. Failure constraints were formulated {{to be used in}} a combined weight/strength and nonlinear mathematical programming automated design procedure to determine the minimum mass column for a particular combination of design load and length. Numerical studies gave the mass characteristics of the truss column for broad ranges of load and length. Comparisons of the truss column with a baseline tubular column used a special structural efficiency parameter for this class of columns...|$|R
2500|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 1950, as many as 200 men were {{involved}} in the final steps of completion of the 1950 Tacoma Narrows Bridge. [...] On July 24, workers from Roebling's Sons were involved in wrapping and caulking the suspender cable bands, and the railings on the sidewalks were being completed. By August 22, the road deck was taking shape, as workers continued concrete pours for the roadway. Painting began that week, as eleven men worked the paint crew sandblasting and painting the <b>stiffening</b> <b>truss.</b> The bridge received its first coat of [...] "Narrows Green" [...] paint - a grayish-green hue (its predecessor had been painted the same color a decade before). By September 30, workers installed the finishing touches on the toll plazas, including installing sheetrock and plumbing. The midspan and tower hydraulic damping mechanisms were also installed, and workers began removing the catwalks, tower buttresses, and other working platforms.|$|E
2500|$|Testing {{on the new}} bridge {{design was}} begun in November 1943 and {{continued}} through 1945. The studies included 200 different configurations, to wind forces hitting the span at up to plus-or-minus 45-degrees perpendicular to the deck. Then, testing was performed on a design using open strips of wind grating placed in the roadway, which added even greater stability against torsional movement. A design with bottom lateral bracing on the <b>stiffening</b> <b>truss</b> was also tested to test the resistance against lateral movement. Then, a design was tested with motion damping devices located on the deck at three locations: one at each tower (one {{at each end of}} the main span, and one on each side span at the tower), and a set of damping devices at mid-span on each main cable. [...] Each of these steps in the design and testing phase were performed to reduce as much lateral and torsional movement as possible.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1920, Holton D. Robinson (b. 1863, Massena, NY, d. 1945, {{engineer}} of the Williamsburg Bridge) contacted Steinman {{and requested}} that they join forces {{to create a}} design for the Florianópolis Bridge (or Hercilio Luz Bridge, 1926) in Florianópolis, Brazil. After getting advice from Charles Fowler, Steinman agreed and they formed the firm of [...] in 1921, a partnership that lasted until the 1940s. They did not win the contract immediately but continued to collaborate on it and other projects. The early 1920s were considered a tough time for bridge construction, so Steinman tried to design his bridges to be economically pleasing rather than artistic, without sacrificing the structural integrity of the bridge. For example, Robinson and Steinman changed the original plans for the Florianopolis bridge, using eyebar chains as the upper chord of the <b>stiffening</b> <b>truss</b> instead of the conventional wire-cable. The new design produced a very stiff bridge with much less material than the original plan. Other bridge engineers {{would also have to}} take this new economical design into account when competing with Steinman. Steinman was well regarded in the profession and had a reputation for good presentations and for being politically astute.|$|E
50|$|The roadway {{was only}} 24 ft wide and, without <b>stiffening</b> <b>trusses,</b> soon proved highly {{unstable}} in the wind. The {{deck of the}} Menai Bridge was strengthened in 1840 by W. A. Provis and, in 1893, the entire wooden surface was replaced with a steel deck designed by Sir Benjamin Baker. Over the years, the -ton weight limit proved problematic for the increasing freight industry and in 1938 the original wrought iron chains were replaced with steel ones without the need to close the bridge. In 1999 the bridge was closed for around a month to resurface the road and strengthen the structure, requiring all traffic to cross via the nearby Britannia Bridge.|$|R

Based on the project of River Baling Bridge of large <b>stiffening</b> steel <b>truss</b> girders, this study creates a three-dimensional fine model for it via CAD, pre-assembles each parts of the bridge, and checks sections and dockings one to one correspondingly.

His talent and ingenuity helped him create the two longest suspension bridges of his time. Ammann was known for being able to create bridges that were light and inexpensive, yet they were still simple and beautiful. He was able to do this by using the deflection theory. He believed that the weight per foot of the span and the cables would provide enough stiffness so that the bridge would not need any <b>stiffening</b> <b>trusses.</b> This made him popular during the depression era when being able to reduce the cost was crucial. Famous bridges by Ammann include the following: ...|$|R
2500|$|The final {{designs of}} the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, once finalized, were a sharp and drastic {{contrast}} from the design by Leon Moisseiff. Instead of a thin plate girder, an open-air <b>stiffening</b> <b>truss</b> with {{a depth of}} [...] would form the new road deck. Newer, larger towers that rose [...] higher and [...] wider than Gertie's towers, would support the bridge's main cables, now [...] in diameter versus Gertie's [...] Newer, larger anchor blocks would support a load that weighed 1.6 {{times as much as}} the original bridge. However, some elements of Galloping Gertie were incorporated into the 1950 span. The tower pedestals were enlarged and raised [...] On the west end stood a [...] long approach viaduct with the same [...] deep girders Gertie's main deck had. This approach viaduct used three support towers, two with thin support beams and one with the structural complexity and design of one of Gertie's main towers - each spaced [...] apart. The viaduct, after a structural examination, was kept and utilized as part of the 1950 bridge's design, with an additional box strut brace added to the tower closest the shoreline (officially known as Tower #3 in the design plans), and widening of the upper box strut for the new bridge's deck.|$|E

50|$|The Throgs Neck Bridge {{was planned}} and managed by Robert Moses. His first {{plan for a}} Throgs Neck span dates back to 1945, six years after the nearby Bronx-Whitestone Bridge was {{completed}} 2 mi to the west. This bridge {{was one of the}} few not intended for the Belt System of highways wrapping around Queens and Brooklyn. Moses commissioned famed New York City bridge designer Othmar Ammann, the man behind the George Washington, Bronx-Whitestone, Verrazano-Narrows, and Triborough bridges. This was Ammann's first long-span job after 1940, which saw the collapse of the original Tacoma Narrows Suspension Bridge in the state of Washington. Instead of employing a rather streamlined-looking plate-girder system, Ammann constructed his bridge with 28 ft <b>stiffening</b> <b>trusses</b> under the deck. These would weight the bridge and allow any wind to simply blow through, instead of against, the bridge.|$|R

The {{investigated}} bridge crosses the Ebro River at Amposta, Spain and consists of two steel <b>stiffening</b> <b>trusses</b> {{and a series of}} equally spaced steel floor beams; the main span is supported by inclined stay cables and two series of 8 suspension cables. The dynamic test was performed in operational conditions, with the transceiver installed in different positions, in order to record the response of the deck and of all the arrays of inclined stay cables. Several vibration modes of the deck were successfully identified, using different output-only techniques, and a good agreement (in terms of both natural frequencies and mode shapes) was generally found between the different methods. Similarly, the application of classic spectral estimation to the data collected on the cables seems to provide accurate estimation of the cable frequencies...|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{originally}} included six vehicle {{lanes and}} two streetcar tracks {{on the main}} deck, with provision for a rapid transit track in each direction outboard of the deck's <b>stiffening</b> <b>trusses,</b> which rise above the deck rather than lie beneath it. The tracks were built to the nonstandard broad gauge of the Public Service Company of New Jersey's Camden streetcar system; the design called for the streetcars to cross the bridge from Camden to Philadelphia, enter an underground terminal beneath the bridge's west entrance plaza, and return to Camden via the opposite track. Streetcar stations were also built in the bridge's anchorages. None of the streetcar facilities were ever placed in service, as Public Service ran no cars across the bridge from its opening until the company abandoned its Camden streetcar system in 1932; after that, the tracks were removed, and the space was converted to vehicular lanes.|$|R

25|$|A {{suspension}} bridge {{is a type}} of bridge in which the deck, the load-bearing portion, is hung below suspension cables on vertical suspenders that carry the weight of the deck below, upon which traffic crosses. Primitive in their earliest form, the ancestor to what is now considered a {{suspension bridge}}, the simple suspension bridge, was developed sometime around 2000 BC in China and India, relying upon ropes thrown across a narrow gorge or river, from which people could hang as they crawled across. With the extreme dangers of swinging back and forth, these simple suspension bridges were deemed impractical as horses as well as carriages later found it difficult to maneuver across their wooden planks. The world's first suspension bridge in a modern sense, the Jacob's Creek Bridge at approximately 70 feet in length, was invented by James Finley of Uniontown, Pennsylvania in 1801, who designed vertical towers to elevate the curved iron cables and to <b>stiffen</b> <b>trusses</b> {{in order to make the}} deck of bridges architecturally sound for passing travelers. Nowadays, suspension bridges use steel cables. However, the suspension bridge and its basic, fundamental design of which Finley is duly accredited to inventing, is still evident today in suspension bridges found throughout the world.|$|R
5000|$|In 1922, The Market Street Bridge {{experienced}} a major cable failure after damaged caused by heavy freight cars crossing the bridge. The West Penn Traction Company called upon {{the services of}} Dr. David B. Steinman, a structural engineer and major bridge developer from New York City. Steinman was a renowned American Bridge Company developer and was most famous for the Mackinac Bridge in Michigan. [...] After meeting with the original designer E.K. Morse in Pittsburgh, Steinman arrived in Steubenville and began climbing the towers of the bridge {{to get a better}} look at the broken cables. Misunderstanding his intentions, observers panicked for fear that Steinman was suicidal. He designed improvements including the incorporation of the open deck design for the Market Street Bridge. The repairs which began in the same year as the failure increased the carrying capacity and weight limit of the bridge. Steinman may have fully repaired the bridge, but paid the price in his career after being kicked out of the American Institute of Consulting Engineers. Steinman had upset Morse after finding his original design to be flawed and unsafe. However, Steinman did further work on the bridge in the 1940s, putting new braces on the towers, new <b>stiffening</b> <b>trusses,</b> and replacing the wood-based roadway.|$|R
