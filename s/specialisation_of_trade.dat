In particular, the analysis focuses on the role <b>of</b> product <b>specialisation</b> in relation to world trade growth and competition from emerging countries. We used trade indicators to describe and asses the state <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> flows and <b>trade</b> patterns <b>of</b> a particular country like India and also to monitor these flows over time and across countries. Till the early 1990 s, India was a closed economy: average tariffs exceeded 200 percent, quantitative restrictions on imports were extensive, and there were stringent restrictions on foreign investment. The country began to cautiously reform in the 1990 s, liberalizing only under conditions of extreme necessity. Since that time, trade reforms have produced remarkable results. The economy is now among the fastest growing in the world. This leads some to see India as a ‘rapid globalizer’ while others still {{see it as a}} ‘highly protectionist’ economy. India however retains its right to protect when need arises. Agricultural tariffs average between 30 - 40 percent, anti-dumping measures have been liberally used to protect trade.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} an economy can import {{sustained}} growth, {{in spite of}} not possessing mechanisms to absorb foreign knowledge. To do that, it develops a two-country model of exogenous growth with investment-specific technological change. In autarky, one country sustainably grows while the other economy remains stagnant. In the trade situation, the quality-adjusted terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> become increasingly favourable to the second economy, which results in the transmission of growth. The continuous improvement {{in the quality of}} imported capital goods relative to exported consumption goods is the reason why this occurs.

Specialisation {{in the case of}} an agriculture-based {{developing}} country might be feared to imply a higher reliance than ever on low skill labour. Trade might thus be seen as a step away from the much awaited structural transformation of the economy, which can only come with increases in agricultural productivity. In this paper, we suggest that it needs not be the case. We show that trade openness can in fact trigger the structural transformation of such an agrarian society. It can induce a higher reliance on human capital accumulation and produce the necessary productivity gains for an economy to pick up. Our dynamic general equilibrium model provides a clear illustration of the mechanics behind such structural transformation...|$|R

40|$|Rwanda is {{constrained}} by an export structure that is {{heavily dependent on}} {{one or a few}} agricultural export products such as coffee, tea, pyrethrum and cinchona. The country did not manage to industrialize or to diversify its export structure significantly during the post-independence period. The situation was worsened by the civil war of 1994, which almost destroyed all sectors of the economy. Traditional export crops, such as coffee, cotton, tea, cocoa, palm oil and tobacco are all subject to large price fluctuations and declining world market prices. This paper considers the case for diversification into non-traditional agricultural exports as a strategy for improving a developing country’s terms <b>of</b> <b>trade.</b> The study puts forward a case of Highland Flowers Project; a flowers project located in rural Kigali about 5 kilometres to the Kigali International airport and considers a time scope of 1990 - 2002, 12 years.

40|$|The {{trajectory}} of the Taiwanese economy over past decades has reflected transitions in global geo-economy towards a vertical <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> global <b>trade,</b> knowledge-based competition, variation of industrialisation in the Third World, regional trisection of the world economy, etc. Its industry, making remarkable progress based on a long-term national assistance, {{is involved in the}} outward direct investment whereby overseas production is arranged. Such strategic actions of industrial capital slice through national boundaries and, meanwhile, incorporate state-business relationships on a broader scale at a national level. The thesis seeks to portray the transnationalisation of the Taiwanese IC sector through its specific organisational processes and spatial dynamics with an aim to understanding the way that indigenous firms are associated with the home state and the convergence of IC production systems on subnational, transnational and global scales. This work finds that the outward expansion of the IC industrial capital reflects a spatial trend converging on China, the Yangtze River Delta in particular, owing to a reshuffle of the global electronic production chain. However, flow of capital and material along the chain across the Taiwan Strait move along a circuitous route. It also finds that a persistent inter-state feud accounts for the domestic debates over the westward investment of the IC capital. There is tension between the neo-liberalist logic of business practices and national intervention in a guided capitalist stance. It underlines the conflicts of imperative territoriality. On the one hand, the firms recognise the necessity of stretching industrial territories to the Mainland in consideration of sectoral competitiveness. On the other hand, what the state is concerned with lies not only in the impacts of industrial de-territorialisation upon domestic industries but also in the result of over-dependence upon China that would incorporate national economy into economic territories of the Great China Circle.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This {{paper is}} an {{investigation}} {{on the evolution}} <b>of</b> Italian <b>trade</b> {{with a group of}} Central and Eastern European economies (CEECs) over the period 1988 - 1997. CEECs show patterns <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> very similar to the Italian ones, based on traditional sectors, with a high intensity of labour and physical capital. Moreover, the evolution of comparative advantages suggests a tendency towards a growing <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> CEECs in labour intensive productions. An econometric test of the relationship between CEEC – Italy comparative advantages and industry factor intensities at 3 -digit NACE level highlights a shift of CEECs comparative advantages towards labour-intensive productions over the transition. However, by considering intra-industry trade it appears that vertical product differentiation explains a relevant share <b>of</b> <b>trade.</b> Based on these results, no serious displacement effects should come to Italian exports from CEECs competition in traditional sectors, due to specialisation in different quality segments. However, important labour market effects cannot be ruled out, as suggested by an econometric test of the employment effects associated with vertical intra-industry <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> Italy with CEECs...|$|R

We extend the analysis <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> - economic development nexus and search for the determinants <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> diversification process. Using a panel data-set for 60 countries and twenty years (1985 - 2004), we combine synthetic specialisation measures obtained with manufacturing exports data (SITC Rev 2, 3 digit) {{with a wide range of}} country-specific variables characterising their size, geographical conditions, endowments, human capital or institutional setting. It turns out that distance from major markets and country size are the most relevant and robust determinants of export diversification process, explaining together around half of between country variability in specialisation patterns. The results are robust to changes in the disaggregation scheme and in the estimation procedure. sectoral diversification, structural change, trade...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary draft- {{comments}} are welcome Abstract: This paper studies the impact <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> on the price-elasticity of aggregate labour demand, {{based on the}} idea that a variation in the cost of (a given type of) labour has an effect on the sectoral <b>trade</b> <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> an economy, at the expense of the domestic productions using this factor intensively, even when the trade balance is kept unchanged. As this effect is more important the more open the economy, trade openness induces an increase in the associated labour-demand elasticity, through an "international competitiveness effect". This argument is illustrated by a simple model, based on an Armington hypothesis, with an empirical assessment for France. JEL Classification: F 16...|$|R
