However, because of the {{predicted}} thousand years until {{the rise of the}} next Empire (of which only a few hundred had elapsed), the series lacked a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>closure.</b> For decades, fans pressured him to write a sequel. In 1982, Asimov gave in after a 30-year hiatus, and wrote what was at the time a fourth volume: Foundation's Edge. This was followed shortly thereafter by Foundation and Earth. The story of this volume (which takes place some 500 years after Seldon) ties up all the loose ends and brings together all of his Robot, Empire and Foundation novels into a single story. He also opens a brand new line of thought in the last dozen pages regarding Galaxia, a galaxy inhabited by a single collective mind. However, this concept was never explored further. According to his widow Janet Asimov (in her biography of Isaac, It's Been a Good Life), {{he had no idea how}} to continue after Foundation and Earth, so he started writing the prequels.|$|E

Some Rwandans say that it has helped set in motion reconciliation within their communities. The majority of praise for Gacaca has come from Rwanda's government and the Rwandan citizens who have direct experience with the system. Naturally this is a biased source, however {{it is important to note}} that it is those most affected by the Rwandan genocide who are offering praise, citing a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>closure,</b> acceptance, and forgiveness following Gacaca trials. The Gacaca trials also served to promote reconciliation by providing a means for victims to learn the truth about the death of their family members and relatives. They also gave perpetrators the opportunity to confess their crimes, show remorse and ask for forgiveness in front of their community.|$|E

500|$|Similar to {{what they}} had done with other social issues and in {{developing}} their curriculum, the CTW researched the topic of death and how preschoolers understand it. [...] The first step in their research process was to assemble a team of experts, led by CTW research director Lewis Bernstein, in the fields of child psychology, child development, and religion. [...] The team advised the show's writers and producers how to handle the topic, in what they called [...] "a curriculum bath"; Bernstein described it in this way: [...] "We bring in the experts to allow the writer to soak in expertise. [...] We in Research bring in people to provide the information, and then the artistry of the writer takes over, as they integrate what they've heard". [...] The experts advised the producers to provide their viewers with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>closure</b> about Mr. Hooper's death. [...] They decided not to focus on how Mr. Hooper died, since explaining that he was old and ill might increase children's fears about death. [...] They chose to deal with his death in a single episode, and convey simple messages like: [...] "Mr. Hooper is dead; Mr. Hooper will not be coming back; and Mr. Hooper will be missed by all". [...] Gikow stated that the episode they created was an example of the writers and producers' skills as educators as well as entertainers.|$|E
50|$|New York University {{professor}} Tom R. Tyler argued that, from {{a psychological}} standpoint, crime shows {{are more likely}} to increase the rate of convictions than acquittals, as the shows promote a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> justice and <b>closure</b> which is not attained when a jury acquits a defendant. The perceived rise in the rate of acquittals may be related to sympathy for the defendant or declining confidence in legal authorities.

The TV Addict lauded the episode for returning to the tone and themes of the first season, calling it [...] "the perfect mix of mystery, excitement, romance and snappy one-liners". The publication also praised Bell and Colantoni's performances. Jesse Hastenger of PopMatters graded the episode an 8 out of 10. Kath Skerry of Give Me My Remote expressed dissatisfaction with The CW for cancelling the series, but she praised the episode as a standalone installment: [...] "As for the final two episodes themselves, they would have been magnificent season finales. It was classic Veronica Mars. Drama, comedy, inside jokes [...] and callbacks to yesteryear." [...] On his blog, Cultural Learnings, critic Myles McNutt said that Colantoni should have been nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his performance in the episode, saying that [...] "this final sacrifice is Colantoni's strongest character arc all season and is the proper episode selection for the actor."

A rhythmic cadence is a characteristic rhythmic pattern that indicates {{the end of a}} phrase. A cadence is labelled more or less [...] "weak" [...] or [...] "strong" [...] depending on its sense of finality.

40|$|The {{literary}} work of Toni Morrison {{is famous for}} its rich intertexuality, interweaving narrative, contemporary history, and tales and motifs from oral storytelling traditions. Her tenth novel, Home (2013), is no exception. It contains disturbing and dark narratives of childhood abuse, war trauma, and racial discrimination, which are offset by Morrison’s use of motifs from the tale of “Hansel and Gretel,” one of the best-known fairy tales collected by the Grimm brothers and called “a great and ferocious classic” by Philip Pullman (84). I explore the interplay between trauma and fairy-tale motifs in Home, a novel that engages with central themes of Morrison’s previous work, such as gender, race, family, and empowerment. In this novel, Morrison envisages ways toward the resolution of trauma that contribute to developments in literary trauma theory and presents a new and stronger <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> positive <b>closure</b> to the thematics of trauma than has so far been the case in her fiction...|$|R
40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Urban {{school districts}} {{across the country}} are {{responding}} to poor performance, declining enrollments, and budget shortfalls by closing public schools in large numbers. Much of the research to date has focused on the impact <b>of</b> school <b>closure</b> on student achievement; we know little about its broader impact, particularly on the low-income communities of color most affected. This study used qualitative methodology and a participatory action research design to examine the impact of a public school closure on a low-income community of color in Chicago. Findings show that school closure had a range of negative impacts, among them a chaotic and crowded school environment with reduced access to resources, disconnection from social roles and networks for both parents and students, and created further disinvestment in a neighborhood on the edge of gentrification. Grassroots community organizing helped parents and community members make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the <b>closure,</b> and engaged them in the educational policy process to work for change. Findings inform our understanding of how one community experienced and reacted to a public school closure, and have implications for both scholars and educational leaders...|$|R
40|$|Presented at the 14 th International Conference on Auditory Display (ICAD 2008) on June 24 - 27, 2008 in Paris, France. This paper {{discusses}} {{an approach}} to auditory stimulus design that appropriates concepts and techniques commonly used in music composition. These ideas are used to create referential sound cues that orient a listener along a timeline. The functions these cues serve may include: emphasizing arrival at targeted goals; providing orientation information relative to beginning and end times; or creating a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> imminent <b>closure</b> indicating a predictive end to an ongoing process. The stimulus used in the pilot study represents this team's first attempt at integrating musical ideas with stimulus design. In {{an effort to make}} this stimulus comparable with previously used experimental stimuli, extreme restrictions were placed on the design. Although the resulting stimulus is {{not to be confused with}} `music' in the proper <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> that term, it is interesting to note how an extremely restricted set of elements can be manipulated to create an aesthetically satisfactory experience that rivals responses to `real' music in untrained listeners. The application of musical techniques towards the construction of effective auditory stimuli that are, at the same time, rated aesthetically satisfactory by users, is a long-term object of study by this team...|$|R

40|$|Religious {{fundamentalism}} {{has been}} consistently linked to prejudice toward a variety of outgroups. This article proposes that this is partially the case because fundamentalist ideology provides a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> consistency and <b>closure.</b> Outgroups that challenge the epistemic certainty that fundamentalism provides are rejected {{in an effort to}} protect this certainty. Results from two studies, including one using a nationally representative sample, found that the need for closure was related to fundamentalism and partially mediated the relationship between fundamentalism and the derogation of lesbians and gays (Study 1) and value violators in general (Study 2). Furthermore, in Study 2, it was found that only some aspects of the need for closure explain the fundamentalism–prejudice relationship. Results are discussed in relation to past need for closure and ideology research as well as what this means for the study of fundamentalism...|$|R
40|$|This article aims {{to re-evaluate}} the {{contribution}} of Stanley Fish to legal studies. In  "The Law  Wishes to Have a Formal existence", Fish accused the law of maintaining a formal,  positivistic self-image as principled; an activity rhat rises above processes of interpretation and of moral judgement. For this `antiformalist‘ Fish there is thus a false <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> self-sufficent <b>closure</b> to the law 2 ̆ 7 s discourse. More recently however: in discussing the practice of another profession (namely literary criticism) Fish demonstrates that the basis of aclivity per se is internal intelligibility - that is intelligibility  within a defined community. These apparent  inconsistencies are explored. Re-reading ` The Law Wishes to Have a Formal Existence 2 ̆ 7 one can discern errors in Fish 2 ̆ 7 s account of a key case and one can also find support for the  professionalism position that he subsequently articulates. It is therefore argued that  Fish 2 ̆ 7 s account of the general characteristics of professional practice, including legal, are of value. The implications of his account of professionalism in the law are, however, incompatible with the usual understanding of his more combative statements {{about the role of}} formal language and principle-based argument of the law...|$|R
