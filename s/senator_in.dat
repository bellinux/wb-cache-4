50|$|The Florida Constitution {{requires}} state {{senators to}} be elected to staggered, four-year terms. <b>Senators</b> <b>in</b> odd-numbered districts are elected in U.S. presidential election years, while <b>senators</b> <b>in</b> even-numbered districts are elected in midterm election years.

5|$|Odaenathus was {{described}} as Roman <b>senator</b> <b>in</b> the undated tomb inscription and Hairan I was mentioned with the same title in the 251 inscription.

Udo Hartmann concludes that Odaenathus first became a Ras in the 240s then a <b>senator</b> <b>in</b> 250. Another possibility is that the senatorial rank and lordship occurred simultaneously; Odaenathus was chosen as a Ras following Gordian's death, then after Philip the Arab concluded a peace with the Persians, the emperor ratified Odaenathus' lordship and admitted him to the senate to guarantee Palmyra's continuous subordination.|$|E
