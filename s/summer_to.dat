5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Hapalopilus nidulans {{causes a}} white rot in its host. Fruit {{bodies of the}} fungus grow singly, in groups, or in fused and overlapping clusters on the wood of dead and decaying deciduous trees. Preferred hosts include Quercus (oak), Fagus (beech), and Betula (birch), although on rare occasions it has been recorded on conifer wood as well. In central Europe, its preferred host is oak, while in northern Europe it is found most commonly on Corylus and Sorbus. Fruiting typically occurs from early <b>summer</b> <b>to</b> autumn, but the tough fruit bodies are persistent and may be encountered out of the usual growing season.|$|E
5|$|Although Kasuya did not {{explicitly}} define {{the mode of}} nutrition for A.coccinea, most Phallaceae species are suspected to be saprobic—decomposers of wood and plant organic matter. The fruit bodies of A.coccinea, known only from temperate regions of Japan (Tochigi Prefecture), grow solitarily or in groups on rice husks, straw, or dung. They are found from <b>summer</b> <b>to</b> autumn.|$|E

5|$|Cacti {{are often}} grown in greenhouses, {{particularly}} in regions unsuited to {{the cultivation of}} cacti outdoors, such the northern parts of Europe and North America. Here, they may be kept in pots or grown in the ground. Cacti are also grown as houseplants, many being tolerant of the often dry atmosphere. Cacti in pots may be placed outside in the <b>summer</b> <b>to</b> ornament gardens or patios, and then kept under cover during the winter. Less drought-resistant epiphytes, such as epiphyllum hybrids, Schlumbergera (the Thanksgiving or Christmas cactus) and Hatiora (the Easter cactus), are widely cultivated as houseplants.|$|E

After a poor season, Harvey was dropped late in the 195556 season.|$|E

The species is widely distributed in the northern temperate zone, {{and is one of the}} most common of the tooth fungi. It has been recorded from Australia, Europe, northern Asia, and North America.
