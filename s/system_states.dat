5|$|For {{a general}} <b>system,</b> <b>states</b> are {{typically}} not pure, but instead are represented as statistical mixtures of pure states, or mixed states, given by density matrices: self-adjoint operators of trace {{one on a}} Hilbert space. Moreover, for general quantum mechanical systems, {{the effects of a}} single measurement can influence other parts of a system {{in a manner that is}} described instead by a positive operator valued measure. Thus the structure both of the states and observables in the general theory is considerably more complicated than the idealization for pure states.|$|E
5|$|The United States Clean Air Act, {{passed in}} 1990, put mercury {{on a list}} of toxic {{pollutants}} that need to be controlled to the greatest possible extent. Thus, industries that release high concentrations of mercury into the environment agreed to install maximum achievable control technologies (MACT). In March 2005, the EPA promulgated a regulation that added power plants to the list of sources that should be controlled and instituted a national cap and trade <b>system.</b> <b>States</b> were given until November 2006 to impose stricter controls, but after a legal challenge from several states, the regulations were struck down by a federal appeals court on 8 February 2008. The rule was deemed not sufficient to protect the health of persons living near coal-fired power plants, given the negative effects documented in the EPA Study Report to Congress of 1998. However newer data published in 2015 showed that after introduction of the stricter controls mercury declined sharply, indicating that the Clean Air Act had its intended impact.|$|E

In complicated systems this can require computer-assisted calculation capabilities, and cannot always ensure robustness. Furthermore, all <b>system</b> <b>states</b> are not in general measured and so observers must be included and incorporated in pole placement design.|$|E

Operational {{definitions}} are also used to define <b>system</b> <b>states</b> {{in terms of a}} specific, publicly accessible process of preparation or validation testing, which is repeatable at will. For example, 100 degrees Celsius may be crudely defined by describing the process of heating water at sea level until it is observed to boil. An item like a brick, or even a photograph of a brick, may be defined in terms of how it can be made. Likewise, iron may be defined in terms of the results of testing or measuring it in particular ways.|$|E

25|$|In {{the western}} part of the country, water {{ownership}} is controlled by the appropriative system. This <b>system</b> <b>states</b> that the owner of a piece of land does not automatically own the rights to water found on that land. Rights to water belong to the first user who puts the water to beneficial use. The first people to become appropriators of the water source have the right to continue using the water in the same quantity as always as long as they continue putting the water to good use. This holds true no matter how many other people wish to use the water. The latest water appropriator loses all of their water rights before any water rights are taken from the next latest appropriator. The Fort Belknap Reservation in Montana, which had been created by the government in 1888, experienced issues with the appropriative water system when water flow to their reservation was being diverted to settlements of non American Indians.|$|E
500|$|The {{issue of}} a clear {{definition}} for planet {{came to a head}} in January 2005 with the discovery of the trans-Neptunian object Eris, a body more massive than the smallest then-accepted planet, Pluto. In its August 2006 response, the International Astronomical Union (IAU), recognised by astronomers as the world body responsible for resolving issues of nomenclature, released its decision on the matter during a meeting in Prague in the Czech Republic. This definition, which applies only to the Solar <b>System,</b> <b>states</b> that a planet is a body that orbits the Sun, is massive enough for its own gravity to make it round, and has [...] "cleared its neighbourhood" [...] of smaller objects around its orbit. Under this new definition, Pluto and the other trans-Neptunian objects do not qualify as planets. The IAU's decision has not resolved all controversies, and while many scientists have accepted the definition, some in the astronomical community have rejected it outright.|$|E

The practice of caste <b>system,</b> <b>states</b> Jodhka, is decried by Sikhism, but like Hindus, Christians and Muslims, Sikhs have practiced a caste system. The system, along with untouchability, has been more common in rural parts of Punjab. The landowning dominant Sikh castes, states Jodhka, [...] "have not shed all their prejudices against the lower castes or dalits; while dalits would be allowed entry into the village gurdwaras {{they would not be}} permitted to cook or serve langar." [...] The Sikh dalits of Punjab have tried to build their own gurdwara, other local level institutions and sought better material circumstances and dignity. According to Jodhka, due to economic mobility in contemporary Punjab, castes no longer mean an inherited occupation nor are work relations tied to a single location.|$|E

In this paper, state estimation for a distribution network is developed and enhanced by incorporating composite load model.
