40|$|Process based {{models have}} been {{developed}} to simulate ammonia (NH 3) volatilization after surface slurry spreading, but none of them have managed to realistically represent slurry infiltration into the soil {{and the development of a}} specific slurry interface that modifies surface temperature and humidity conditions. To account for these physical effects, it is proposed to add to the model a layer of slurry on the surface of the soil. It is hypothesized that the <b>slurry</b> <b>layer</b> can be regarded as a soil layer from the hydrological point of view, characterized by its specific hydraulic parameters, and whose thickness depends on the quantity and bulk density of the slurry dry matter. An assessment was performed by comparisons with measurements of NH 3 volatilization fluxes from two specific datasets. The addition of the <b>slurry</b> <b>layer</b> clearly improved the simulations of both the NH 3 volatilization flux and ammoniacal nitrogen (NHX-N) distribution in the soil. This concept together with its parameterization proved to be relevant for accounting for effect of the slurry application rates on volatilization, and subsequent abatement obtained with band spreading. The efficiency factor was improved from - 0. 35 to 0. 71. This concept also succeeded in describing the <b>slurry</b> <b>layer</b> state over the whole range from slurry ponding at the surface to the dried-out state, via a slurry in an intermediate drying state. This was actually a prerequisite for the good simulation of NH 3 volatilization over the whole volatilization event.

The ZrO 2 was used to impart mechanical strength and the apatite layer was coated for functional biocompatibility. The coating layer, from the outside in, was composed of sol–gel hydroxyapatite (HA) /slurry HA/slurry FA. The sol–gel coating powder had a lower crystal-linity than the slurry coating powder. The sol–gel HA coating over the HA/FA <b>slurry</b> coating <b>layer</b> made the surface very smooth. The sol–gel coating over the <b>slurry</b> coating <b>layer</b> enhanced the bonding strength up to 33 MPa. The dissolution rate of the sol–gel/slurry coating layer was much higher than that of the slurry coating. Moreover, the rate could be controlled by altering the heat-treatment temperature of the sol–gel HA layer.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that a mushy layer develops at the ICB while the outer core material freezes onto the inner core. This view is obtained in reference to metallurgical or analog experiments on solidification {{carried out in the}} laboratory where morphological instability almost always follows constitutional supercooling. However, morphological instability is not an automatic consequence of supercooling: supercooling and stable solid-liquid interface may coexist under certain conditions such as might perhaps occur at the ICB. If these conditions are realized, there could be both solidification on the ICB and crystallization of small solid particles in the supercooled layer (<b>slurry</b> <b>layer).</b> We made a linear stability analysis of a unidirectionally advancing solid-liquid interface under the ICB conditions. Several values of liquidus slope against concentration of light material (mc) are used for the stability analysis. It was confirmed that supercooling and interstability may coexist if |mc| is low although this value of |mc| is believed to be too small as the liquidus slope at the ICB. The estimated amount of supercooling in the layer is of order 0. 1 K, and this provides an estimate of the size and population of solid particles in the <b>slurry</b> <b>layer.</b> However, even though the value of |mc| is small, to sustain such <b>slurry</b> <b>layer</b> at the ICB is unlikely due to (i) the difficulty of continuous supply of enough number of nuclei into the layer and (ii) the Rayleigh-Taylor instability by the compositional buoyancy.

40|$|This {{paper has}} dealt with direct contact heat {{exchange}} characteristics between ice water slurry (average ice particle diameter : 3. 10 mm) and hot air bubbles. The hot air bubbles ascending in the layer fluidized the ice water <b>slurry</b> <b>layer,</b> and the bubbles were cooled down directly by the ice water slurry. The following results {{were obtained from the}} experiment. In case of ice water <b>slurry</b> <b>layer,</b> the hot air bubbles fluidized the layer in earlier stage and heat exchange performance was higher than using only ice particles layer. The maximum temperature efficiency increased as Reynolds number Re increased because fluid in the layer became active and kept at the fixed value in the region of Re >__= 900. Dehumidity efficiency increased as modified Stefan number and Re increased since the heat capacity of inlet air and heat transfer coefficient increased. Some empirical correlations for temperature efficiency, dehumidity efficiency and the completion time of latent cold heat release were derived in terms of various nondimensional parameters. 近年、電力需要の急増傾向に対応すべく、夜間電力を利用した氷蓄熱システムの開発が盛んに行われ、ビル用空調を初めとして一般業務用空調にも製品として展開されてきている。その中で、蓄熱槽内にて氷と熱交換した冷水を利用側空調へ搬送させて冷房運転を行う水搬送方式に替わって、氷水スラリーを直接、利用側空調機へ搬送する氷水搬送技術の研究開発が行われている。このシステムは氷の潜熱を直接、利用側へ供給することにより、冷水搬送方法と比較して単位流量当たりの冷熱輸送能力が格段に増大するため、配管口径の縮小や輸送動力の低減が図れるものである。さらに、氷水スラリー搬送技術に加えて、搬送された氷水スラリーを冷房熱源として二重管式熱交換器の内管に流動させ、その外管に温水を流して採冷熱する方法や、角氷を充填層へ搬送して空気と直接接触熱交換させる採冷熱方法が提案されている。また、各種潜熱蓄冷熱材を被熟媒体とし、空気泡を熱媒体として両者を直接接触させて熱交換する直接接触熱交換に関する研究も行われている。上記直接接触熱交換では、噴射空気泡により潜熱蓄冷熱材が流動するため、潜熱蓄冷熱材の温度場が均一となり、潜熱蓄冷熱材と空気泡との熱交換が比較的均一に進行するという利点がある。しかしながら、氷水と空気との直接接触型潜熱放冷特性に関する研究が少ないのが現状である。氷水と空気との直接接触型放冷方式では、空気は氷水により冷却されるだけでなく、空気に含まれる水蒸気が氷水により凝縮されるため、冷却と除湿を同時に行える効果が期待できる。本研究は均一な氷水スラリー層を対象として、氷水スラリー層下部に多数の円形ノズルを均一に配列した分散板を設置し、そこから温空気を層内に噴射し、発生した空気泡と氷水スラリーとを直接接触熱交換させた場合の氷の融解挙動および通過空気の熱交換特性について実験的に検討するものである。その際の現象は粒状氷と水との混合割合や通過空気流速等を変化させることによりさまざまに変化させることが可能である。本研究では実験因子である流入空気温度、湿度、空気流量および氷質量充填率が、熱交換後の空気温度、湿度および潜熱放冷完了時間に及ぼす影響について実験的に検討し、これらの相関関係を実験式の形でまとめることを狙いとする...|$|E

Mepacrine had no effects on rates of contracture, but was found to significantly delay cell death during isotonic incubations of both metabolically inhibited and ischemic cells. In contrast, mepacrine had no effect on the development of osmotic fragility. Incubation of metabolically inhibited myocytes in calcium-free media did not delay contracture or cell injury, but did attenuate the protective effects of mepacrine.

40|$|Thermo-active structures, such {{as energy}} piles, {{are used to}} store and extract heat energy from soil. In areas with {{seasonal}} freezing and thawing, such infrastructure is subjected {{to changes in the}} soil structure and, consequently, the soil strength. This research investigated the influence of repeated freeze-thaw (FT) cycles and different freezing rates on the shear strength of a frost susceptible Illite clay. Samples of saturated clay were subjected to between 1 and 20 FT cycles, and the shear strength was determined using undrained unconsolidated triaxial tests on the thawed samples. Soil subjected to freezing exhibited a reduction in shear strength compared to never-frozen soil. Slower freezing rates (warmer surface temperatures) resulted in lower shear strength. Results indicated an inverse relationship between the number of FT cycles and the shear strength with a constant applied freezing temperature. Strength recovery occurred between 1 and 3 freezing cycles. Between 3 and 7 FT cycles, the shear strength decreased, after which it approached an equilibrium shear strength between 7 and 10 FT cycles. The increase in shear strength between 1 and 3 FT cycles at a high freezing rate was not identified in the literature reviewed, but coincides with a decrease in stiffness and ice lens thickness. The reduction in shear strength with increasing FT cycles was attributed to movement of pore water through the sample and formation of ice lenses, which damaged the soil microstructure. The ice lenses formed via cryogenic suction pulling unfrozen pore water towards the freezing front and layer where a new ice lens was growing. Macro-CT scans showed decreasing size of ice lenses with increasing FT cycles, and denser ice lens formation near the freezing surface. The largest change in shear strength and ice lens formation occurred between a surface temperature of - 5 and - 10 °C. Ice lenses increased in size moving away from the freezing surface, and a saturated ‘slurry’ layer formed when the samples thawed. Samples failed along the plane of the largest ice lens. Slower freezing rates resulted in thicker ice lenses and <b>slurry</b> <b>layers,</b> which resulted in lower shear strength and stiffness. At high freezing rates, the soil stiffness was almost double that of the never-frozen clay due to local consolidation of clay fragments. With decreasing freezing rates, local consolidation was offset by formation of large horizontal ice lenses. CT scans indicated that after being exposed to multiple FT cycles, the microstructure of the clay was destroyed. The evolution of shear strength should be taken into account in geotechnical design, as a period of thermal consolidation may be required prior to full loading and the rate and number of times a soil is frozen significantly impacts its shear strength.

40|$|AbstractDue to {{the growth}} of {{commercial}} activities in port of Lengeh in south Iran, it was necessary to rehabilitate and upgrade the existing airport which is almost one hundred years old. Severe distresses that occurred in runway and other aircraft operational areas required that the bearing capacity of the existing pavements should be increased. Limited dimensions of the runway and other operational areas in the airport (i. e. runway, taxiway and apron) required these to be extended and widened. A full recycling program was planned including sub-grade and sub-base stabilization with lime in widening areas and base strengthening with foam bitumen and cement slurry in both existing and new constructed sections.

40|$|Three-Dimensional Printing (3 DPTM) is a rapid-manufacturing process {{originally}} developed at MIT for building parts directly from CAD-generated models. Parts are fabricated in "slices" {{by creating a}} complete layer of powder and then selectively joining powder particles with a polymer binder deposited using a moving printhead. Traditional 3 DPTM builds layers by spreading dry powder and prints binder using a rastering scheme with a continuous-jet printhead. For smaller parts and greater accuracy, {{a variation on the}} process called slurry 3 DPTM (s 3 DPTM) uses raster-built slurry layers and a vector-printing scheme with a drop on demand (DoD) printhead. This here thesis presents efforts to improve core technology in both dry-powder 3 DPTM and slurry 3 DPTM. One of the most critical steps in s 3 DPTM is the building of the slurry layers. To avoid intra- and interlayer defects the <b>slurry</b> <b>layer</b> must be rastered at high deposition rates to promote line merging and better layer quality. The difficulty lies in the design of a machine capable of oscillating the slurry nozzle at the required frequencies. Fortunately, such a design was completed and the machine built as part of a collaborative effort with TDK Japan to build an s 3 DPTM machine for manufacturing small parts. The design uses a reciprocating countermass strategy to recycle mechanical energy and eliminate troublesome vibrations. A general overview of this <b>slurry</b> <b>layer</b> forming station (LFS) is given, along with an in-depth treatment of several components, including the forcers, centering system, and interface software. And speaking of rastering, dry-powder 3 DPTM relies on this strategy for printing binder, just as the LFS uses a raster method to build powder layers. Beginning with observations made during the design of the LFS, the fluid-handling system was redesigned to improve binder droplet stream stability during the carriage traverse and turnaround. The improvement was made possible by repositioning a smaller version of the "Clamshell" constant pressure vessel used to set the fluid flow rate to the printhead carriage itself and using a closed-loop control system to maintain a constant fluid level in the Clamshell. Drawings, parts lists, schematic diagrams, and assembly instructions are included for building additional fluid control systems. by David C. Ables. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Slurry-based 3 D {{printing}} is a {{new technology}} designed to further increase the feature resolution capabilities of 3 D printing. This technology deposits an unprinted wet <b>slurry</b> <b>layer</b> by rapidly depositing overlapping parallel lines of slurry to form each layer. Line registration may affect the final properties of the part and it is therefore desirable to control the registration of slurry lines within each layer and from one layer to the next. A galvanometer was used to adjust nozzle position to compensate for line position errors. The galvo correction was calculated and actuated using a PMAC controller running programmable logic controller programs. The line spacing controller is successful in improving line spacing and registration over open loop performance. However, the degree of line position improvement is not certain due to measurement errors. Because of the large measurement variability, the line spacing may actually be better than measured. Developing more accurate diagnostics is important to determine {{the accuracy of the}} line position controller. More importantly, the effect of different line registration patterns on layer and part characteristics should be investigated. by Kristopher J. Seluga. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|In yeast, aging {{appears to}} be marked by a {{progressive}} impairment in cellular mechanisms, resulting in irreversible changes in physiology and morphology. To date, very little has been reported about the biochemical changes that occur in yeast {{as a function of}} individual cell aging. To investigate this further, six generations of a brewing yeast strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCYC 1239) were separated according to cellular age using continuous phased culturing and biotin-streptavidin magnetic cell sorting. To obtain cells with no bud scars (virgin cells), a concentrated yeast <b>slurry</b> was <b>layered</b> onto sucrose density gradients and centrifuged. The uppermost band from the gradients was collected and cells were biotinylated with biotinamidocaproate- N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, that covalently binds to lysine residues on the yeast cell wall. For continuous phased culturing, biotinylated cells were added to a carbon-limited nutrient medium and growth was synchronized using the doubling time of the cells. Harvested cells were incubated with streptavidin superparamagnetic beads and sorted with a strong permanent magnet. In total, approximately 75 % of the biotinylated cells were recovered. Viability testing was conducted using vital staining and plate counts, with > 98 % viability reported with the vital stain and 37 % viability with the agar plates. In conclusion, continuous phased culture, together with magnetic cell sorting has the potential to become a powerful tool for the study of age-related biochemical changes in yeast. Further studies will focus on ensuring the reproducibility of the method and using the recovered cells to study biochemical changes occurring during yeasts' replicative lifespan...|$|R
40|$|The linear {{analysis}} of convective morphological instability of the planar liquid-solid phase transition boundary is developed. The new stability criterion, {{dependent on the}} main parameter-extension rate (proportional to the vertical derivative of the fluid velocity), is deduced. This criterion generalizes analytical results of the recent works [H. Shimizu, J. P. Poirier, J. L. Le Mouël, Phys. Earth Planet. Inter. 151 (2005) 37 - 51; R. Deguen, T. Alboussire, D. Brito, Phys. Earth Planet. Inter. 164 (2007) 36 - 49], where convective mechanisms were only partially introduced in the model equations and stability analysis. The convective stability criterion demonstrates that the neutral stability curve divides two possible domains of morphologically stable and unstable solidification. These domains existing in the constitutionally supercooled conditions lead to two different crystallization scenarios "constitutional supercooling + morphological stability" and "constitutional supercooling + morphological instability", which are described by idealized nonlinear <b>slurry</b> and mushy <b>layer</b> models with convection. Analytical solutions of these models taking into account nucleation and kinetic mechanisms of the growing solid phase are constructed for the steady-state solidification conditions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Amending {{irrigation}} furrow inflows with polyacrylamide (PAM) at low concentrations (10 mg L- 1) reduces irrigation-induced erosion by 94 % and increases infiltration by 15 %, relative to untreated furrows. We hypothesized that PAM erosion-control technology would allow irrigation managers to increase furrow inflows to speed furrow-stream advance, produce a more uniform water distribution down field, {{and reduce the}} leaching hazard at the upper end (due to reduced infiltration opportunity time and/or shorter sets). We developed, tested, and installed instruments in a furrow irrigated Portneuf silt loam (Co-Si, mixed, mesic, Durixerollic Calciorthids with 1. 6 % slope) to investigate this premise. Soils were instrumented with repeating pulse multivibrator (CS- 615) soil water sensors, thermocouples, tensiometers, and percolation soil water samplers at upper and lower ends of the furrows. Percolation samplers consisted of a 23 -cm-deep, 20 -cm-dia. stainless-steel beaker with a 1 7 -cm-long, 4 -cm-dia., 0. 5 bar air-entry ceramic cup imbedded in a 5 -cm-deep silica flour <b>layer,</b> <b>slurried</b> into the beaker bottom. Water was collected under suction (- 1. 4 x ambient) via teflon tubes. Percolation sampler design and testing, field installation, and study experimental design are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Development {{of a new}} {{generation}} tool materials on the basis of M 2 high speed-steel or 41 Cr 4 steel covered with the carbides. Application of pressureless forming of powder as a manufacturing method of anti-wear coatings gives the possibility to produce this materials with relative low cost of production. Design/methodology/approach: Powder metallurgy, pressureless forming of powder, sintering, microstructure examination, X-ray dispersive energy examination, hardness examination. Findings: Putting down coatings with this method does not call for using the costly equipment for the physical or chemical deposition of coatings from the gaseous phase. Coating thickness may be easily regulated by applying the powder-binder <b>slurry</b> <b>layer</b> once or several times on the prepared substrate surface. Hardness of coatings in the sintered state is higher compared to the HS 6 - 5 - 2 and 41 Cr 4 steels by about 400 and 700 HV respectively. It is expected that hardness of the coatings and substrate will grow after their heat treatment. Practical implications: Application of powder metallurgy and especially pressureless forming of powder to manufacturing of steel covered with anti-wear coatings gives the possibility to obtain tool materials with the relative high ductility characteristic of steel and high hardness and wear resistance typical for cemented carbides. Originality/value: One can state, based on the investigations carried out, that the pressureless forming of the powder may be used for depositing the anti-wear coatings onto the tool materials and other elements in the abrasion wear service conditions...|$|E
40|$|The tank 241 -SY- 101 {{transfer}} system was conceived {{and designed to}} address the immediate needs presented by rapidly changing waste conditions in tank 241 -SY- 101. Within approximately the last year, the waste in this tank has exhibited unexpected behavior (Rassat et al. 1999) {{in the form of}} rapidly increasing crust growth. This growth has been brought about by a rapidly increasing rate of gas entrapment within the crust. It has been conceived that the lack of crust agitation beginning upon the advent of mixer pump operations may have set-up a more consolidated, gas impermeable barrier when compared to a crust regularly broken up by the prior buoyant displacement events within the tank. The interim goals of the project are to: (1) protect the mixer pump operability (2) begin releasing gas from the crust, and (3) begin dissolving the crust and solids in the <b>slurry</b> <b>layer.</b> The final goals of the project (Final State) are to solve both the level growth and BD-GRE safety issues in this tank by achieving a condition of the waste such that no active measures are required to safely store the waste, i. e., crust and non convective layer are mostly dissolved, and therefore the mixer pump will no longer be needed to prevent BD-GREs in excess of 100 % LFL. Transfers (which are designed to create space in the tank) and dilution (which will dissolve the solids) will accomplish this. Dissolution of solids will result in a release of gas retained by those solids and remove that volume of solids as a future retention site...|$|E
40|$|Tank 241 -SY- 101 (SY- 101) is a double-shell, {{radioactive}} waste storage tank with waste that, before the recent transfer and water back-dilution operations, {{was capable of}} retaining gas and producing buoyant displacement (BD) gas release events (GREs). Some BD GREs caused gas concentrations in the tank headspace to exceed the lower flammability limit (LFL). A BD GRE occurs when {{a portion of the}} nonconvective layer retains enough gas to become buoyant, rises to the waste surface, breaks up, and releases some of its stored gas. The installation of a mixer pump in 1993 successfully mitigated gas retention in the settled solids layer in SY- 101 and has since prevented BD GREs. However, operation of the mixer pump over the years caused gas retention in the floating crust layer and a corresponding accelerated waste level growth. The accelerating crust growth trend observed in 1997 [...] 98 led to initiation of sequences of waste removal and water back-dilutions in December 1999. Waste is removed from the mixed <b>slurry</b> <b>layer</b> in Tank SY- 101 and transferred into Tank 241 -Sy- 102 (SY- 102). Water is then added back to dissolve soluble solids that retain gas. The initial transfer of 89, 500 gallons of SY- 101 waste, diluted in-line at 0. 94 : 1 by volume with water, to SY- 102 was conducted in December 1999. The second transfer of 230, 000 gallons of original SY- 101 waste, diluted approximately 0. 9 : 1, was completed in January 2000, and the third transfer of 205, 500 gallons of original SY- 101 waste diluted at 0. 9 : 1 was completed in March 2000...|$|E
40|$|Anew fixed abrasive-type Polishing Pad for CMP of {{semiconductor}} device oxide layer like as lLD and STI is examined. The new type polishing pad is composed two thin layers {{which are a}} Ceria fixed abrasive and polymer layer, arranged in a line alternatively, and kept in a vertical position to the pad surface. The examined polishing pads are made from three kinds of polymer, Acrylic esters, Polyurethane, Polystyrene selected as a material for a binder of the fixed abrasive layer and the polymer layer. The pad combined Acrylic esters for binder of fixed abrasive layer and Polyurethane for polymer layer shows the highest material removal rate(M. R. R). Applying to diluted Ceria <b>slurry</b> for oxide <b>layer</b> CMP, the examined pad shows much higher M. M. R. than ordinary Foamed Polyurethane Pad. The new fixed abrasive-type polishing pad is possible to reduce amount of Ceria slurry to 1 / 3 〜 1 / 5. We discuss the polishing mechanism applying the new fixed abrasive-type polishing pad at the viewpoint {{of the relationship between}} M. M. R. and concentration of extricated Ceria abrasive upon a pad, then conclude that M. M. R. does not have an effect on fixed abrasive on pad, but on extricated abrasive from the pad...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{increase}} in use of layered inorganic/organic hybrid materials as solid base catalysts, novel composite materials, and pharmaceutics {{has resulted in}} considerable interest in the design, synthesis and understanding of these systems. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are often used {{in the preparation of}} hybrid materials. Environmentally attractive synthetic routes are studied for the synthesis of MgAl-LDHs incorporating a series of organic dicarboxylate anions (malonate, succinate, glutarate and adipate). The reaction conditions are systematically explored to ascertain the effect of acid chain length, Mg source, <b>slurry</b> weight, and <b>layer</b> charge (i. e. Mg/Al ratio). The materials are characterised by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, infra-red spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and elemental analysis. The effect of reaction conditions on product purity and morphology are reported. Impurity free organo-LDHs at low slurry weights and Mg/A 1 = 2 are observed. Energy minimization and molecular dynamics computer simulations using both classical atomistic theory and ab initio density functional theory (DFT) are used to investigate the reactivity of organo-LDHs. The influence of the LDH layer charge and water content on the photo-reactivity of intercalculated cinnamate molecules is investigated. Qualitative agreements with previously reported experimental results are obtained. DFT is used to understand the previously reported catalytic reactivity in tert -butoxide intercalculated MgAl-LDHs. The computer simulations identity limitations to the mechanism proposed in the literature and suggest an alternative plausible reaction mechanism.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the optimization of the grinding parameters of {{ductile cast iron}} in wet conditions and with the minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) technique. The objective of this project is to investigate the performance of ductile cast iron during the grinding process using the MQL technique and to develop artificial neural network modeling. In this project we used the DOE method to perform the experiments. Analysis of variance with the artificial neural network method is used to investigate significant effects on the performance characteristics and the optimal cutting parameters of the grinding process. Ductile cast iron {{was used in this}} experiment and the ethanol glycol was applied in the conventional method and compared with the MQL method. During conventional grinding, a dense and hard <b>slurry</b> <b>layer</b> was formed on the wheel surface and the performance of the ductile cast iron was very low, threatening the ecology and health of the workers. In order to combat the negative effects of conventional cutting fluids, the MQL method was used in the process to formulate modern cutting fluids endowed with user- and eco-friendly properties. Aluminum oxide was used as the grinding wheel (PSA- 60 JBV). This model has been validated by the experimental results of ductile cast iron grinding. Each method uses two passes - single-pass and multiple-pass. The prediction model shows that depth of cut and table speed have the greatest effect on the surface roughness and material removal rate for the MQL technique with multiple-passes by showing improved surface roughness, preventing workpiece burning and enabling a more friendly environment. Thus, various other parameters need to be added for further experiments, such as the wheel speed, distance from the wheel to the workpiece zone contact, and the geometry of the nozzle...|$|E
