40|$|Synopsis: The {{behavior}} of beam-column connections in R/C frame structures {{has been extensively}} studied since the 1960 ’s. These studies have served {{as the basis for}} design guidelines for R/C joints, in which detailing requirements and stress limits are given to control damage and deterioration of strength and stiffness in the connections. However, no particular attention is paid to the deformation in the joint region and its relation to the connection strength. In this paper a model is presented to evaluate the shear strength of R/C joints for various levels of joint <b>shear</b> <b>distortion.</b> The joint model is based on the state of plane strains in the connection through the development of a ratio between the joint principal strains, which was determined from experimental results. Based on the joint model, stress limits are proposed for interior and exterior joints for a <b>shear</b> <b>distortion</b> of 1 %. These limits are similar to those recommended by ACI-ASCE Committee 352 for exterior connections. However, they are lower than those recommended for interior joints.

Ferrocement is proposed to protect the joint region through replacing concrete cover. Six exterior beam-column joints, including two control specimens and four strengthened specimens, are prepared and tested under constant axial load and quasi-static cyclic loading. Two levels of axial load on column (0. 2 fc'Ag and 0. 4 fc'Ag) and two types of skeletal reinforcements in ferrocement (grid reinforcements and diagonal reinforcements) are considered as test variables. Experimental results have indicated that ferrocement as a composite material can enhance the seismic performance of deficient beam-column joints in terms of peak horizontal load, energy dissipation, stiffness and joint <b>shear</b> strength. <b>Shear</b> <b>distortions</b> within the joints are significantly reduced for the strengthened specimens.

The model is firstly validated with experimental tests on diagonally pre-cracked beams under sustained loads.

Afterwards, the model is applied to study the influence of restraining strains due to long-term creep and shrinkage in the service and ultimate shear response of frames.

The weak lensing methods are a geometric shear-ratio method and 3 D cosmic shear. The analysis here uses an extension of the Fisher matrix framework to jointly include photometric redshift systematics, <b>shear</b> <b>distortion</b> systematics and intrinsic alignments. We present results for DUNE and Pan-STARRS surveys. We show that assuming systematic parameters are fixed, but possibly biased, results in potentially large biases in dark energy parameters. We quantify any potential bias by defining a Bias Figure of Merit. We also show the effect on the dark energy Figure of Merit of marginalising over each systematic parameter individually. We find that the largest effect on the Figure of Merit comes from uncertainty in the photometric redshift systematic parameters. These can reduce the Figure of Merit by up to a factor of 2 to 4 in both 3 D weak lensing methods, if no informative prior on the systematic parameters is applied. <b>Shear</b> <b>distortion</b> systematics have a smaller overall effect. Intrinsic alignment effects can reduce the Figure of Merit by up to a further factor of 2. This, however, is a worst case scenario. By including prior information on systematic parameters the Figure of Merit can be recovered to a large extent. We conclude that, as a rule of thumb, given a realistic current understanding of intrinsic alignments and photometric redshifts, then including all three primary systematic effects reduces the Figure of Merit by at most a factor of 2, but that in reality this factor should be much less.

We here derive expressions for the twist of supercoiled DNA and the writhe of a closed molecule consistent with the modern view of DNA as a sequence of base-pair steps. Structural biologists commonly characterize the spatial disposition of each step in terms of six rigid-body parameters, one of which, coincidentally, is also called the twist.

For this purpose, starting from the force equilibriums, a relation is derived between transverse shear stresses and transverse forces. The resulting functional matrix contains on its elements terms which are quadratic in z. This approach has two essential advantages over determining the transverse shear forces from the transverse <b>shear</b> <b>distortions.</b> On one hand, one obtains steady profiles of the transverse shear stresses over the laminate thickness. On the other hand, now {{it is also possible}} to calculate the transverse normal stress. For this purpose, the transverse forces must be derived to x and y. The above functional matrix is integrated over z. The execution of these steps comprised two essential points. First, the derivations of transverse forces had to be provided by the B 2000 finite element program. This meant that the corresponding B 2000 subroutine had to be extended to the calculation of the second derivatives of the interpolation functions. Subsequently, the SPANNUNG. FOR program developed at the Institute for Structural Mechanics of the German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR), Braunschweig, was extended by the integration of the functional matrix in thickness direction and by the calculation of the transverse normal stress.
