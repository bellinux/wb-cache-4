5|$|Beato, who {{had covered}} {{military}} operations in India and China, was probably attracted by {{the news of the}} annexation. While he arrived in Burma after the main military operations ended, he would still get to <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the action, as the annexation by the British led to an insurgency which lasted for the following decade. This allowed Beato to take a number of pictures of British military in operations or at the Royal Palace, Mandalay, as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Later volumes {{were also}} praised; Otaku USAs Joseph Luster {{appreciated}} the series' battles and Allen's development. The revelation that Allen {{would be an}} enemy of the Order and the 14th Noah was well received by Grant Goodman of Pop Culture Shock and Chris Beveridge of the Fandom Post. However, Goodman criticized early-volume reliance on comedy rather than plot. Beveridge and Erkael of Manga News were impressed with Kanda's dark past. Douresseaux liked Allen's situation in volume 21 (due to the character's connections with the Noah), and wanted to <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> that and less of Kanda's fight with Alma Karma.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Little Busters! and Ecstasy, an adult {{spin-off}} titled Kud Wafter was developed by Key and released on June 25, 2010. Set directly after the events of Little Busters!, the story follows Riki and Kudryavka as they start to <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> {{each other in a}} romantic relationship at the onset of summer vacation. A mobile app game for iOS and Android titled Little Busters! Card Mission, produced through VisualArt's and distributed via Mobage, was released on April 24, 2013.

5|$|In July 1945, Lawton handed in a {{transfer}} request at Everton {{as he wanted}} a move to a Southern club so as to <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> his increasingly estranged wife. In November 1945, he was sold to Chelsea for a fee of £14,000. Chelsea continued to play regional wartime fixtures as national league football had not resumed for the 1945–46 season, and Lawton also continued his uncapped appearances for the England national team. In the summer of 1946, following his demobilisation, he coached for the FA in a summer camp in Switzerland. He scored a club record 26 goals in 34 league games in the 1946–47 season. However he struggled to settle at Stamford Bridge and came into conflict with manager Billy Birrell after refusing {{to go on a}} pre-season tour of Sweden in 1947, which resulted in him requesting {{a transfer}}. He favoured a move to Arsenal, but this was ruled out by the Chelsea hierarchy. Lawton turned down an approach by Sunderland manager Bill Murray as he held out hope that Chelsea would relent and allow him a move to Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have noted}} Allen's {{interactions}} with other characters during the series, and IGN's Richard Osborn enjoyed the comic relief of his clashes with Kanda against the series' dark plot. John Rose of the Fandom Post considered {{the team of}} Allen and fellow Exorcist Yu Kanda the greatest strength of the manga's second volume. In a later review, Rose enjoyed the plotline in which Allen was unable to distinguish innocents from Akumas. Allen's rematch with enemy Noah Tyki Mikk was praised by Casey Brienza of Anime News Network. Brienza also liked his new abilities, the Innocence Crown Clown and Allen's sword, comparing it to a sword in Final Fantasy VII wielded by protagonist Cloud Strife. Reviewing the same fight, Otaku USAs Joseph Luster praised Allen's development during the series and enjoyed his battle with Tyki. Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin liked Allen's situation in volume 21, and wanted to <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the same instead of the focus on Kanda's fight against the Akuma of Alma Karma. During Allen's imprisonment for saving Alma, Anne Lauenroth of Anime News Network found the growing camaraderie between Allen and Tyki interesting; it led to Allen's decision to leave the Order after putting his comrades in danger, and his goodbye to Lenalee was mournful.|$|E

25|$|The home {{field of}} the Tigers, Hanshin Koshien Stadium, {{is one of three}} major natural grass {{baseball}} stadiums in Japan. The others are the Mazda Stadium in Hiroshima (Hiroshima Toyo Carp), and Skymark Stadium in Kobe (part-time home of the Orix Buffaloes). Of the three, only Koshien has an all-dirt infield (the other two aforementioned parks have an American-style infield). There are numerous smaller grass field ballparks around the country; Japanese baseball teams frequently play games in small cities so that local fans can <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> their heroes.|$|E
25|$|Also, the {{decision}} {{as to whether or not}} the mate is good can be made with the emotional boundary of the shadchan who, if so desired by the couple, can call and talk to either side in the beginning stages of the dating to iron out issues that can crop up during the dating process. Usually as the couple <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> each other the shadchan backs away and lets the couple manage it themselves.

At the end of the tournament he was controversially left out of New South Wales' side for the first match of the Sheffield Shield in favour of the younger Daniel Hughes despite being the top run-scorer of the entire tournament in the previous season. Australian captain Steve Smith took responsibility for the decision saying that he wanted to <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> Hughes as he felt Hughes had the potential to become an international player for Australia.|$|E

25|$|In Fall 2008, former ABC Daytime president, Brian Frons began {{hinting that}} more Sam and Jason {{interaction}} would {{occur in the}} future, because the audience wanted to <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> that. In late 2008, Jason and Sam began to soften to one another again when a man named Joe walked into General Hospital with a bomb strapped to his chest and demanded that his pregnant wife get treatment after previously being turned away. During the lockdown, Elizabeth ran into the hospital with Jake after being in a house fire. Joe initially refused to let any of the doctors help Elizabeth and Jake, but Sam managed to convince Joe to allow Jake treatment. Soon after, Jason arrived at GH, and he and Sam fell back into their old pattern and worked together to stop Joe. Jason and Sam then went their separate ways for a few months, but they both maintained a mutual friend in Spinelli and this sometimes caused them to cross paths.|$|E
25|$|In 1887 Burnett {{traveled}} to England for Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, {{which became the}} first of yearly transatlantic trips from the United States to England. Accompanied by her sons, she visited tourist attractions such as Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum in London. In her rented rooms she continued the Tuesday evening salon and soon attracted visitors, meeting Stephen Townsend for the first time. Despite her busy schedule, she felt ill {{from the heat and}} the crowds of tourists, spending protracted periods in bed. With her sons, she moved on to spend the winter in Florence, where she wrote The Fortunes of Philippa Fairfax, the only book to be published in England but not in the United States. That winter Sara Crewe or What Happened at Miss Minchin's was published in the United States. She would go on to make Sara Crewe into a stage play, and later rewrite the story into ALittle Princess. In 1888, Burnett returned to Manchester, where she leased a large home off Cromwell Road, had it decorated, and then turned it over to cousins to run as a boarding house, after which she moved to London, where she again took rooms, enjoyed the London season, and prepared Phyllis for production, a stage adaptation of The Fortunes of Philippa Fairfax. When the play ran she was disappointed by the bad reviews, and turned to socializing. During this period she began to <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> Stephen Townsend, whom she had met during the Jubilee year.|$|E

Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter listed her {{change as}} a highlight of the episode, and hoped to <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> her new attitude. The Atlantic Kevin Fallon called it [...] "the most interesting thing Quinn has done since giving birth to a baby to the soundtrack of 'Bohemian Rhapsody'", but VanDerWerff suggested the development hinged on the fact the producers no longer knew how to utilize Agron.|$|E

[...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed being able to <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> Massive Dynamic, and praised Astrid's increased presence in the plot.

500|$|Tourism {{developers}} have marketed Tana Toraja as an exotic adventure—an area rich in culture {{and off the}} beaten track. Western tourists expected to see stone-age villages and pagan funerals. Toraja is for tourists who have {{gone as far as}} Bali and are willing to <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the wild, [...] "untouched" [...] islands. However, {{they were more likely to}} see a Torajan wearing a hat and denim, living in a Christian society. Tourists felt that the tongkonan and other Torajan rituals had been preconceived to make profits, and complained that the destination was too commercialised. This has resulted in several clashes between Torajans and tourism developers, whom Torajans see as outsiders.|$|E
500|$|... is a Japanese adult visual novel {{developed}} by Key released on November 25, 2005 for Windows PCs. The {{game is a}} spin-off of Key's earlier all ages game Clannad. Key later released versions of Tomoyo After without the erotic content, and the game was ported to the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 under the title Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life CS Edition; CS stands for [...] "consumer software".

500|$|To {{further the}} {{traditional}} [...] "Sonic formula", every level was designed in a tube-like fashion; Sonic {{would be able}} to walk onto walls, thus changing the direction of gravity and the rotation of the level itself, much like the special stages in Knuckles' Chaotix. In addition, an unusual, fish-eye lens-styled camera was put into place so players could <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> their surroundings at any given time. [...] Senn has highlighted that the 3D gameplay still kept true to the Sonic series formula of collecting rings and speeding through game levels. [...] Wallis also made mention of the game's overall layout, consisting of three acts per zone and varying in focuses on speed, exploration, and puzzle solving.|$|E
