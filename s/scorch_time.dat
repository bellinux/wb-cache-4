40|$|This {{research}} is {{concentrated on the}} effect of concentration of silane- 69 used for surface modification on precipitated silica (PSi), on cure characteristic and mechanical properties of PSi filled NR. The PSi content in this study was fixed at 20 phr in order to reveal the effect of silane used to modify PSi, on NR compound and vulcanizate. Moving Die Rheometer (MDR) was used to characterize cure characteristic of rubber compounds. Generally, <b>scorch</b> and cure <b>time</b> of NR would increase with the addition of PSi due to the absorption of accelerator on its surface whereas the addition of Si- 69 modified PSi would reduce both <b>scorch</b> and cure <b>time.</b> It was found in this research that the excess amount of Si- 69 used increased <b>scorch</b> and cure <b>time</b> of rubber compounds.

One race was recorded to have up to 13,000 fans, with an additional 2,000 arriving to the event by train. To his credit, Deerfoot never did run a boring race; his tactics for running events enraged his competition and enlivened spectators: he would pursue his opponent until he felt he could maintain a lead over them, then proceed to quickly pass his opponent, jog slow enough in front for his opponent to catch up, then pull away, only to fall back to only a few feet ahead of his opponent and repeat the cycle of slowing down and speeding up until the finish of the event. Running with an inconsistent pace was unheard of in those days, and often forced his opposition to fall off of their paces early on, giving him a clear advantage. This game of cat and mouse invigorated fans, and also ensured that Deerfoot would only run hard enough to defeat his opponents and not waste energy so as to continue on in his extremely rigorous running tours across the English countryside.Much of Deerfoot's popularity was contingent upon his maintenance of his [...] "savage" [...] character. At his manager's prodding, Deerfoot would placate the most highly respected of viewers by several well documented acts. In the most famous of which, Deerfoot would sit at a bar with a guest of honor until late hours of the night, then allowed his entourage to watch him retire on his hotel room floor wrapped in a bear skin vehemently rejecting to sleep in the bed. In other circumstances, Deerfoot was encouraged to deal out warrior-whoops to the public, of which stories grew dramatic and embellished.While many of these acts were staged to gain publicity, it is clear that Deerfoot preferred his moccasins over the popular track spikes, which were invented in the 1850s and had become popular during his racing reign. The spikes had risen in popularity due to the plushy nature of tracks at the time period, which were often mulch based instead of compacted materials people run on currently.|$|R
