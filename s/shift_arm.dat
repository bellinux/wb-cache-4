40|$|Gray markets {{arise when}} a manufacturer's {{products}} are sold outside of its authorized channels, for instance when goods designated {{for a foreign}} market are resold domestically. One method multinationals use to combat gray markets is to increase internal transfer prices to foreign subsidiaries {{in order to increase}} the gray market's cost base. We illustrate that, when a gray market competitor is present, the optimal price for internal transfers not only exceeds marginal cost, but is also a function of the competitiveness of the upstream economy. Moreover, the presence of a gray market competitor may cause unintended social welfare consequences when domestic governments mandate the use of arm's length transfer prices between international subsidiaries. When markets are sealed, arm's length transfer pricing strictly increases domestic social welfare. In contrast, we demonstrate that when a gray market competitor is present, mandating the use of arm's length transfer pricing decreases domestic social welfare when the domestic market is sufficiently large relative to the foreign market. Specifically, a <b>shift</b> to <b>arm's</b> length transfer pricing erodes domestic consumer surplus by making the gray market less competitive domestically, which in turn may offset any domestic welfare gains that accompany a <b>shift</b> to <b>arm's</b> length transfer pricing. Finally, the analysis illustrates that in a gray market setting, the transfer price that maximizes a multinational's profits may also be the same one that maximizes the social welfare of the domestic economy that houses it. transfer pricing, gray markets, regulation...|$|R

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{as small}} non-coding RNAs play {{important}} roles in many biological processes such as development, cell signalling and immune response. Studies also suggest that miRNAs are important in host virus interactions where the host limits virus infection by differentially expressing miRNAs that target essential viral genes. Here, we identified conserved and new miRNAs from Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf 9) {{using a combination of}} deep sequencing and bioinformatics as well as experimental approaches. S. frugiperda miRNAs share common features of miRNAs in other organisms, such as uracil (U) at the 5 2 ̆ 7 end of miRNA. The 5 2 ̆ 7 ends of the miRNAs were more conserved than the 3 2 ̆ 7 ends, revealing evolutionary protection of the seed region in miRNAs. The predominant miRNAs were found to be conserved among arthropods. The majority of homologous miRNAs were found in Bombyx mori, with 76 of the 90 identified miRNAs.

The data presented here further support conservation of miRNAs in insects and other organisms. In addition, the results reveal a differential expression of host miRNAs upon baculovirus infection, suggesting their potential roles in host virus interactions.

Pronounced dipole, quadrupole, octupole and Fano resonances are observed in individual cross structures. Furthermore, the nanocross geometry proves to be a useful building block for coherently coupled plasmonic dimers and trimers where the reduced symmetry results in hybridized subradiant and superradiant modes and multiple Fano interferences.
