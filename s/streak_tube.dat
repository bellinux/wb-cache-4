40|$|<b>Streak</b> <b>tube</b> imaging lidar, as a novel flash lidar, {{due to its}} {{advantages}} of higher resolution for low contrast conditions, compact and rugged physical configurations, small image distortions owing to its scannerless design, and higher image update rates, has immense potential to provide 3 D single-laser-pulse scannerless imaging, 3 D multispectral imaging, 3 D multispectral fluorescence imaging, and 3 D polarimetry. In order to further reduce the size and enlarge {{the field of view}} (FOV) of the lidar system, we designed a super small-size, large photocathode area and meshless <b>streak</b> <b>tube</b> with spherical cathode and screen.

Typically, they require high temporal resolution, high spatial resolu-tion, and high dynamic range. The instrument {{of choice for}} most of these multichannel, data-recording applica-tions is the optical streak camera. We have evaluated three optical streak camera systems under similar conditions: (1) the EG &G model L-CA- 15 streak camera, designed and built under U. S.

40|$|Streak cameras {{applied to}} {{inertial}} confinement fusion research and flashless imaging lidar require large working areas. However, {{the larger the}} working area, the bigger the temporal distortion is. And the temporal distortion has a great influence on the detecting precision of the streak camera, resulting in an image distortion on the screen. Yet previous streak camera design work emphasized shorter time resolution and higher special resolution with paying less attention to the temporal distortion extent. Key factors that may affect the temporal distortion are thoroughly analyzed in this paper. We calculate the electric field of a small-size <b>streak</b> <b>tube</b> {{with the aid of}} the Computer Simulation Technology Particle Studio software which is a three-dimensional electromagnetic simulation software based on finite integration technology. Axial electric field distributions at different distances to the axis of the small-size <b>streak</b> <b>tube</b> are displayed. The electron trajectories launched from different points on photocathode of the <b>streak</b> <b>tube</b> are tracked through interpolating pre-calculated electromagnetic field to the particle position. It is known that curved photocathode can reduce the temporal distortion, so we calculate the temporal distortions of streak tubes whose radii of curvature of the photocathode are 30 mm, 35 mm, 40 mm, 45 mm, 50 mm, and 55 mm respectively to ascertain how the curvature influences the temporal distortion. The results show that the temporal distortion is mainly produced in the photocathode-to-deflector region, and it is negligible in the equipotential region. Also, bigger radius of curvature of the photocathode leads to a positive temporal distortion, and smaller one leads to a negative temporal distortion. And the absolute value of the temporal distortion increases with the increase of the slit length. The small-size <b>streak</b> <b>tube</b> whose radius of curvature of the photocathode is 40 mm owns the smallest temporal distortion. We also calculate the temporal distortions of electrons launched from the different positions of the photocathode with different initial energies, and the initial energy has little influence on the temporal distortion. To sum up, the dominating factor that produces the temporal distortion is the curvature of the photocathode. The slit image under a ramp sweeping voltage on screen is curved due to the temporal distortion. And the bigger the temporal distortion, the greater the curvature of the slit image is. Besides, a linear relation between the temporal distortion and deflection of the slit image is displayed. The spatial resolutions of the streak tubes with the radii of curvature of the photocathode 30 mm, 40 mm, 50 mm are calculated respectively. And the small-size <b>streak</b> <b>tube</b> whose radius of curvature of the photocathode is 30 mm has the highest spatial resolution. The radius of curvature of the <b>streak</b> <b>tube</b> photocathode should be carefully selected according to actual requirements for the streak camera.

The inner time;varying electric field of traveling wave deflectors was simulated by CST electromagnetic studio. And the propagation velocity of electromagnetic wave was calculated.

Based on the electron trajectory tracing method and the Rayleigh criterion, dynamic temporal and spatial characteristics of the <b>streak</b> image <b>tube</b> were analyzed, a dynamic {{temporal resolution}} of 200 fs in single sweep mode, dynamic temporal resolution of 208 fs in synchronized sweep mode, and a dynamic spatial resolution of above 20 lp/mm were obtained. © 2016, Science Press.

Even with standardized cameras, such as the Rochester Optical Streak System (ROSS), readings on an identical source can vary over multi-year timescales. Many factors may contribute to these fluctuations, but the most likely cause is degradation of the photocathode. Measuring the absolute quantum efficiency of a <b>streak</b> <b>tube’s</b> photocathode is a lengthy and expensive process.

40|$|Owing to the {{excellent}} feature of ultrahigh temporal resolution, the <b>streak</b> image <b>tube</b> {{has been the}} indispensable scientific instrument for the application to measurement of ultrafast phenomena on subpicosecond time scale. In this paper, a new femtosecond <b>streak</b> image <b>tube</b> with both high temporal and spatial resolution is designed. To improve its integrated performance, a pair of traveling wave deflectors is located before a magnetic solenoid lens in the tube, which minimizes the electron transit time from anode to deflection plates and therefore reduces time dispersion and space charge effects. Using CST microwave studio finite element method, bandwidth and deflection sensitivity of traveling wave deflector have been studied numerically. The result shows that the wide bandwidth of the traveling wave deflectors designed is beneficial {{to slow down the}} electrical deflecting pulse to match the beam velocity in a wide frequency range, which can improve the deflection sensitivity. After tracing the trajectory of electrons and calculating the modulation transform function, we get temporal resolution of 220 fs and spatial resolution above 100 lp/mm. Based on the aberration theory, the aberration formulas of electron trajectory are deduced, which systematically evaluate the imaging quality of <b>streak</b> image <b>tube</b> with modulation transfer function. Finally, static experiment is carried out, and the result shows that the static spatial resolution is better than 35 lp/mm...|$|R

Electron beam deflection is achieved by driving two orthogonal sets of deflection plate assemblies in phase quadrature at a frequency of 200 MHz. The light intensity in the output beam trace is measured by using a circular Reticon array of 720 photodiodes, which is fiber-optically coupled to the output phosphor screen of the tube. Sample measurements of frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser-pulse waveforms are given. Also the output beamwidth has been measured at the 200 -MHz deflection frequency.

40|$|Scannerless (flash) {{lidar system}} based on streak camera is able to realize {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) multi-spectral fluorescence imaging and 3 D imaging polarimetry. Compared with conventional lidar system, the flash lidar system overcomes image distortions caused by the motion between the target and the sensor platform. Other advantages of the flash lidar system are higher image update rates {{and the potential for}} creating a miniaturized lidar system. To meet the requirements for developing this new technology, a super small-sized, large photocathode area and meshless <b>streak</b> <b>tube</b> with spherical cathode and screen is designed with the aid of computer simulation technology (CST) software. The tube with nearly 28 mm wide photocathode work area contains two electrostatic focusing lens, a pair of deflection plates, and a 50 mm diameter output screen. The external dimension of the tube is merely 50 mm x 100 mm. And its electromagnetic fields are calculated in the CST Particle Studio based on the finite integration theory. Some dynamic properties of the tube are analyzed via observing different electron trajectories launched from a number of different points on the cathode. The influences of the deflector position on deflection sensitivity and spatial resolution are analyzed. Increasing the distance between the deflector and the anode pin hole leads to a worse deflection sensitivity but a better spatial resolution. As for the temporal resolution, three electron pulses separated by 30 ps can be well resolved by the <b>streak</b> <b>tube</b> in the dynamic mode. Thus, the dynamic temporal resolution of the <b>streak</b> <b>tube</b> is better than 30 ps. And a 10 lp/mm spatial resolution across the 28 mm long slit on the photocathode can be obtained by estimating modulation transfer functions of the electron trajectories. Temporal distortions at the entire photocathode working area are evaluated, and the data reveal that the larger the photocathode working area, the bigger the temporal distortions are. Also, the temporal distortion is present mainly in the photocathode-to-deflection plates region. In addition, the slit image of the <b>streak</b> <b>tube</b> working in the dynamic mode is simulated and presented. The phenomenon that the slit image is curved due to the temporal distortion is analyzed. Two rectangular electron pulses separated by 50 ps are well resolved by the <b>streak</b> <b>tube.</b> Therefore, the temporal resolution of this small-size steak tube is better than 50 ps with a rectangular slit dimension of 30 mm x 50 mu m on the photocathode, and its electron-optic magnification is 1. 2...|$|E

40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{is a prime}} {{candidate for}} the next generation of planetary instruments, as it addresses the primary goal of mineralogical analysis, which is structure and composition. However, large fluorescence return from many mineral samples under visible light excitation can render Raman spectra unattainable. Using the described approach, Raman and fluorescence, which occur on different time scales, can be simultaneously obtained from mineral samples using a compact instrument in a planetary environment. This new approach is taken based on the use of time-resolved spectroscopy for removing the fluorescence background from Raman spectra in the laboratory. In the SSTARS instrument, a visible excitation source (a green, pulsed laser) is used to generate Raman and fluorescence signals in a mineral sample. A spectral notch filter eliminates the directly reflected beam. A grating then disperses the signal spectrally, and a streak camera provides temporal resolution. The output of the streak camera is imaged on the CCD (charge-coupled device), and the data are read out electronically. By adjusting the sweep speed of the streak camera, anywhere from picoseconds to milliseconds, it is possible to resolve Raman spectra from numerous fluorescence spectra in the same sample. The key features of SSTARS include a compact <b>streak</b> <b>tube</b> capable of picosecond time resolution for collection of simultaneous spectral and temporal information, adaptive <b>streak</b> <b>tube</b> electronics that can rapidly change from one sweep rate to another over ranges of picoseconds to milliseconds, enabling collection of both Raman and fluorescence signatures versus time and wavelength, and Synchroscan integration that allows for a compact, low-power laser without compromising ultimate sensitivity...|$|E

The Rochester Optical Streak System (ROSS) is able to make measurements with 1 % accuracy using its Optical Calibration Module (OCM). Software scripts have been written to optimize the alignment and focus of the camera using the OCM. Because the P 510 <b>streak</b> <b>tube</b> has a slot accelerator and a single electrostatic lens, it will have optimal temporal and spatial foci at different focus voltages. A common mode voltage (CMV) added to the deflection plate voltage allows the plates {{to act as an}} additional electrostatic lens, while still retaining deflection capabilities. This technique focuses a P 510 tube simultaneously in both the temporal and spatial dimensions. A script has been written to determine the optimal CMV and resulting focus voltage for the ROSS with a P 510 tube. Additionally, the performance of low voltage photocathode extraction fields has been measured and agrees with electro...|$|E
40|$|Identification of mine like {{contacts}} (MLCs) {{as either}} mines or non-mines remains {{an important step}} in mine countermeasures (MCM) operations. Optical imagery is the “gold standard ” for identification since, with good quality imagery, it allows unambiguous identification of MLCs as either mines or non-mines. The apparent utility of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for MCM operations is quite appealing, especially if the AUVs are small, low cost, and provide high quality data. A long range goal to the use of AUVs for MCM operations is to equip such AUVs with small, low cost optical sensors capable of providing identification quality optical imagery. OBJECTIVES To be optimally useful, optical sensors designed and developed for AUVs should be small and should require minimal power. In addition, they should be low cost, since the AUV systems themselves must be low cost, and because the AUV might not always be recoverable. Never-the-less, they should provide imagery of sufficient quality to fulfill the crucial identification role in MCM. Identification quality imaging sensors, such as <b>Streak</b> <b>Tube</b> Imaging Lidar (STIL) and Laser Line Scan (LLS), have been developed for larger MCM platforms. These sensor systems are currently relativel...|$|E
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of the <b>Streak</b> <b>Tube</b> Imaging LIDAR (STIL) project {{is to develop a}} mine {{identification}} capability, specifically to use STIL technology to demonstrate the technical feasibility of providing a tactical mine identification capability to airborne mine countermeasures (AMCM) forces. The projected payoff is a decrease in mine clearance time, an increase in clearance effectiveness, and a reduction in the cost per mine cleared. The resulting system must be is compatible and interchangeable with the AN/AQS- 20 volume search sonar (VSS) section. OBJECTIVES The overall objective of this three year collaborative effort between Arete Associates and Coastal Systems Station (NSWCCSS), Panama City, FL is to directly demonstrate the capability of STIL to perform electro-optic identification (EOID) of bottom and close tethered mines from an underwater towed vehicle (AN/AQS- 20) at tactically significant speeds, swath widths, and standoff ranges. The objective of this first year’s effort is to (i) directly demonstrate high resolution 3 -D imaging in the ocean at tactically significant ranges, and in parallel (ii) perform system engineering and design to address the integration of the STIL-EOID sensor into the AN/AQS- 20 towed body (TB) ...|$|E
