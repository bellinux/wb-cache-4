In most developing countries like Ghana, these consequences have often been severe because farmers do not use approved pesticides, and do not follow recommended frequencies {{of pesticide}} application by government agencies for crops.

Principles and procedures for <b>safety</b> assessment <b>of</b> pesticide <b>residues</b> in food as developed by WHO/FAO are described. Different types of toxicity studies in mammalian test animal species are discussed and a strategy is outlined in order to characterize the toxicity profile of a compound {{and the relationship between}} applied doses and adverse effects. <b>Safety</b> testing <b>of</b> agrochemicals should be carried out in relation to its intended use, and in particular attention wilt be paid to toxicity testing <b>of</b> <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> pesticides in food.

30|$|The {{amount of}} {{residues}} {{depends on the}} specific agronomic management used in the cultivation of the herbicide-resistant plants. Data from publications show [77, 78] {{a considerable amount of}} residues from spraying can be expected in genetically engineered soybeans that are resistant to glyphosate formulations. In general, the level of residues is likely to increase due to increasing problems with herbicide-resistant weeds [76]. However, {{there is a lack of}} reliable data covering the actual range of residue load in the plants [79]. EFSA also stated in 2015 [84], that the <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>residues</b> from spraying glyphosate formulations could not be concluded on the data provided by the company. Thus, EFSA was unable to deliver a conclusive risk assessment on the actual risks of residues from spraying with glyphosate and the various glyphosate formulations used in the countries where such plants are cultivated. Therefore, the data regarding residues from spraying glyphosate on the genetically engineered soybeans do not meet the requirements of Regulation 1107 / 2009 or Regulation 396 / 2005. However, neither the EU risk assessor nor the EU risk manager discussed this aspect.|$|E

European legislation concerning the control of residues of veterinary medicinal products requires the evaluation of antimicrobial properties of residues of such products. Three evaluation approaches are accepted: (i) human data, (ii) data to demonstrate no-observed-effect-levels obtained in gnotobiotic human gut ora associated (HFA) animals or (iii) the calculation of a microbiological acceptable daily intake (ADI) from in vitro minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) data. By September 1999, a total of 55 antimicrobial substances of 16 different classes were evaluated in the EU with respect to the safety of their residues to the consumer and for 46 of these the microbiological effects of their residues was assessed. In most instances (41 substances) in vitro MIC data were used for the evaluation and an arbitrary microbiological ADI was calculated. Sufcient human data were present only for tetracyclines (tetra-, chlortetra-, oxytetra- and doxycycline) and adequate data from gnotobiotic animals (human gut ora-associated rats or mice) were available only for tilmicosin.

Because mothers are exposed to insecticides via various routes, accumulated residues are transferred to infants via breast milk, in some cases exceeding recommended intake levels. Except for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>residues</b> of other insecticides in breast milk has not been considered during World Health Organization Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) evaluations. However, very little is known of the health risks posed by these chemicals to infants who, in developing countries, breast-feed for up to 2 years. Objective: We evaluated the need for WHOPES to include breast milk as a potentially significant route of exposure and risk to infants when evaluating the risks during evaluation of IRS insecticides. Discussion: We present evidence showing that neurologic and endocrine effects are associated with pyrethroids and DDT at levels equal or below known levels in breast milk. Co n c l u s i o n s: Because millions of people in malaria control areas experience conditions of multiple sources and routes of exposure to any number of insecticides, even though lives are saved through malaria prevention, identification of potential infant health risks associated with insecticide residues in breast milk must be incorporated in WHOPES evaluations and in the development of appropriate risk assessment tools.

An alternative but neglected source of hormone action that may be considered in this connection is hormone residues in meat from husbandry animals treated with sex steroid hormones for growth promotion.

40|$|The use of {{nitrofurans}} as {{veterinary drugs}} has been {{banned in the}} EU since 1993 due to doubts on the <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> the protein-bound <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> these drugs in edible products. Following treatment of pigs with the veterinary drug furazolidone free 3 -amino- 2 -oxazolidinone (AOZ), the side-chain of the drug, could be detected in the blood in concentrations up to 0. 3 g/ml. The identity of the free AOZ was confirmed by LC/MS. This shows that the side-chain can be released from the parent drug, most likely under the acidic conditions in the stomach. Free AOZ was also detected {{in the blood of}} rats fed pig liver with protein-bound <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> furazolidone. Incubation of isolated pig hepatocytes with radiolabeled AOZ, resulted in the formation of protein-bound metabolites, to a similar extent as observed with furazolidone itself. Much lower levels were formed in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide or 4 -chlorobenzenesulfonamide, most likely due to inhibition of the enzyme involved in the metabolic activation of AOZ. These compounds also prevented the inhibition by AOZ of monoamine-oxidase (MAO) activity in pig hepatocytes. These data strongly indicate that the protein-bound metabolites of furazolidone in tissues of treated animals are derived following metabolic activation of furazolidone itself, but also of the free AOZ side-chain, following its release from the parent drug. In addition to the MAO-inhibition and formation of protein-adducts, AOZ gave a dose-related positive respons in the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test especially in the presence of rat liver S 9 -mix, in tester strains TA 1535 and TA 100. Furthermore, a positive response was obtained in the chromosome aberration test with human lymphocytes and in the bone marrow micronucleus test with mice treated intraperitoneally with AOZ.
