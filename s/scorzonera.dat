60|$|Very unlike France {{are these}} Basque uplands; very like the seaward parts of Devon and Cornwall. Large oak-copses and boggy meadows fill the glens; while above, the small fields, with their five-barred gates (relics of the English occupation) and high furze and heath- grown banks, make you fancy {{yourself}} {{for a moment}} in England. And the illusion is strengthened, as you see that the heath of the banks is the Goonhilly heath of the Lizard Point, and that of the bogs the orange-belled Erica ciliaris, which lingers (though rare) both in Cornwall and in the south of Ireland. But another glance undeceives you. The wild flowers are new, saving those cosmopolitan seeds (like nettles and poppies) which the Romans have carried all over Europe, and the British are now carrying over the world. Every sandy bank near the sea is covered with the creeping stems of a huge reed, which grows in summer tall enough to make not only high fences, but fishing-rods. Poverty (though there is none of what we call poverty in Britain) fills the little walled court before its cottage with bay trees and standard figs; while wealth (though there is nothing here of what we call wealth in Britain) asserts itself uniformly by great standard magnolias, and rich trailing roses, in full bloom here in April instead of--as with us--in July. Both on bank and in bog grow <b>Scorzoneras</b> (dandelions with sword-shaped leaves) of which there are none in these isles; and every common is ablaze with strange and lovely flowers. Each dry spot is brilliant with the azure flowers of a prostrate Lithospermum, so exquisite a plant, that it is a marvel why we do not see it, as 'spring-bedding,' in every British garden. The heath is almost hidden, in places, by the large white flowers and trailing stems of the sage-leaved Cistus. Delicate purple Ixias, and yet more delicate Hoop-petticoat Narcissus, spring from the turf. And here and there among furze and heath, crop out great pink bunches of the Daphne Cneorum of our gardens, perfuming all the air. Yes, we are indeed in foreign parts, in the very home of that Atlantic flora, of which only a few species have reached the south-west of these isles; and on the limit of another flora also--of that of Italy and Greece. For as we descend into the glen, every lane-bank and low tree is entwined, not with ivy, but with a still more beautiful evergreen, the Smilax of South-eastern Europe, with its zigzag stems, and curving heart-shaped leaves, and hooked thorns; the very oak- scrub is of species unknown to Britain. And what are these tall lilies, which fill every glade breast-high with their sword-like leaves, and spires of white flowers, lilac-pencilled? They are the classic flower, the Asphodel of Greece and Grecian song; the Asphodel through which the ghosts of Homer's heroes strode: as heroes' ghosts might stride even here.|$|R

5000|$|Black salsify is {{native to}} Southern Europe and the Near East. As is {{indicated}} by its binomial name, it is generally thought to have spread {{to the rest of}} Europe from Spain, but the first mention of the vegetable by a Western writer came from Leonhard Rudolf, who reported seeing <b>scorzonera</b> at the market of Aleppo in Syria, in 1575. Although it is often claimed that the name of the genus <b>Scorzonera</b> probably derives from the Old French word scorzon, meaning snake (or [...] "adder" [...] to be exact), {{it is more likely that}} the name is derived from the Italian [...] "scorza negra" [...] meaning [...] "black bark"/"black peel" [...] and obviously indicating the dark brown to black skin of the root. The Celtic and Germanic peoples are believed to have eaten the black salsify, which was considered efficacious against the bubonic plague and snake bites until the 16th century. The plant was being cultivated as a vegetable in Italy and France by 1660 and, soon after, the Belgians were growing vast fields of it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vegetable}} called salsify {{is usually}} {{the root of the}} purple salsify, Tragopogon porrifolius; the root is described as having the taste of oysters (hence the alternative common name [...] "oyster plant" [...] for some species in this genus), but more insipid with a touch of sweetness. The young shoots of purple salsify can also be eaten, as well as young leaves http://www.northernbushcraft.com/plants/salsify/notes.htm. Other species are also used in the same way, including the black or Spanish salsify, <b>Scorzonera</b> hispanica, which is closely related though {{not a member of the}} genus Tragopogon.|$|E

50|$|<b>Scorzonera</b> libanotica {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 15 to 80 cm and is covered with fluffy detersile coating. Its erect flower stems are leafy and {{branched}} in the upper part into 3-5 floral heads measuring 2 to 4 cm. The flower heads are supported by a scaly receptacles atop long pedicels. It has glabrous cylindrical involucral bracts that are truncated at the base and slightly constricted at the top. The yellow flowers turn purple-red at the base and are larger than the involucre. It blooms in June and July. The fruit is a white, thick, long and deeply furrowed achene surmounted by a small pappus. S. libanotica leaves are whole, slightly toothed towards the base, oblong or oblong-lanceolate, more or less acute that narrow at the petiole.|$|E
50|$|It {{was founded}} as an {{educational}} children's club in 1886 by Edith Vere Annesley, later Edith Vere Dent. The club grew to include adults, and by the 1920s members included expert botanists. The botanist George Claridge Druce called the society “the Botanical Nursery” because it nurtured potential botanists. Among its members were Noel Sandwith, curator at Kew Gardens, who first discovered <b>Scorzonera</b> humilis, or viper's grass, growing in Britain, botanist Eleanor Vachell who discovered Limosella aquatica x subulata in Glamorgan, and Gertrude Foggitt who recorded Carex microglochin on Ben Lawers, along with the botanist Lady Joanna Charlotte Davy. More recently, the botanist and ecologist Ghillean Prance, president of the society, is someone who first built up a knowledge of flowering plants through his membership of the society and his wild flower diary.|$|E

50|$|The resort was pioneered in 2000 by a {{joint venture}} of <b>Scorzonera</b> Ltd. and Horizont AL as an all-year-round tourist and {{recreational}} complex. The research for potential ski fields and cableways of the first stage was conducted in cooperation with Plan-Alp, Austria, and Ecosign, Canada, who also finalized the master plan for the resort.By late 2001, a first 691-meter ski lift was launched at the Northern slope of Mountain Bukovel along with the projected chairlift ropeway at the Bukovel's north-western slope. The project was finished in Sept.-Oct. 2002 as a 1000-metre ropeway.In 2003 a second slope, 2A ski run with a chairlift was introduced, and in 2004 a 7A ski run with a surface lift started its operation.With mere 48,000 visitors in 2003, Bukovel welcomed 206,000 tourists in 2005-2006, 400,000 in 2006-2007 and 850,000 visitors in 2008-2009. The 2010-2011 winter season recorded 1,200,000 day visits with foreigners amounting to 8-10% of all visitors. In 2012 the Bukovel was named the fastest-growing ski resort worldwide.|$|E
50|$|The root, and {{sometimes}} the young shoots, of T. porrifolius are used as a vegetable, and historically the plant was cultivated for that purpose; it is mentioned by classical authors such as Pliny the Elder. Cultivation in Europe began in the 16th century in France and Italy. In the United Kingdom it was initially grown for its flower and later became a mildly popular vegetable in the 18th century but then declined in popularity. Presently the root is cultivated and eaten most frequently in France, Germany, Italy and Russia. However, in modern times it has tended {{to be replaced by}} Spanish salsify (<b>Scorzonera</b> hispanica) as a cultivated crop. Cultivated varieties include White French, Mammoth Sandwich Island, and Improved Mammoth Sandwich Island; they are generally characterised by larger or better-shaped roots. The root becomes discolored and spoils quickly if broken, which can easily happen since it is difficult to remove from the soil without damage. The root is noted for tasting of oysters, from which the plant derives its alternative name of oyster plant; young roots can be grated for use in salads, but older roots are better cooked, and they are usually used in soups or stews. It is recommended that when using the root that, if cut, its color be preserved in acidulated water. A latex derived from the root {{can be used as a}} chewing gum. The flowering shoots can be used like asparagus, either raw or cooked, and the flowers can be added to salad, while the sprouted seeds can be used in salads or sandwiches.|$|E
