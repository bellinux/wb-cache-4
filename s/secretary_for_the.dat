Knudtzon eventually bequeathed his entire book collection and five of Thorvaldsen's sculptures to the society, with the condition that they not move to Christiania.|$|E

In the short-lived minority Labour government of 1924 she served as parliamentary secretary in the Ministry of Labour. Her term of cabinet office in 1929–31 was marked by the economic crises that beset the second Labour government.

5|$|Heydrich {{developed}} close professional relationships {{only within}} the circle of the SS security forces. Heinrich Müller was one such example, and Heydrich appears to have trusted him. Adolf Eichmann's straightforward loyalty impressed Heydrich, and was one reason why he appointed him as <b>secretary</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Wannsee Conference. Herbert Kappler, who was appointed as commander of all SS security forces in Rome, {{was said to have}} been a protégé of Heydrich. SS personnel favoured by Heydrich, especially those who attended the Wannsee conference, possessed similar traits of devotion to SS, lack of remorse regarding brutal or genocidal orders, and above all personal loyalty to Heydrich in his capacity as commander of the security forces. On the other hand, Heydrich's dislike and distrust of Arthur Nebe and Walter Schellenberg may have stemmed from their independence and ambition.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, Cleveland's father {{moved to}} Clinton, Oneida County, New York, {{to work as}} {{district}} <b>secretary</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> American Home Missionary Society. Despite his father's dedication to his missionary work, the income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school into a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned to Clinton and his schooling {{at the completion of}} the apprentice contract. In 1853, when missionary work began to take a toll on his health, Cleveland's father took an assignment in Holland Patent, New York (near Utica) and the family moved again. Shortly after, he died from a gastric ulcer, with Grover reputedly hearing of his father's death from a boy selling newspapers.|$|E
5|$|SMS Von der Tann was {{the first}} German battlecruiser, ordered in 1907. She was {{designed}} {{in response to the}} British s, construction on which had begun the previous year. As the first of a new type, the design process for Von der Tann was highly controversial. Großadmiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the State <b>Secretary</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Imperial German Navy, wanted the ship to follow the British pattern of large guns, relatively light armor, and high speed. Kaiser Wilhelm II, along with other senior navy officers instead argued that, owing to Germany's numerical inferiority, the new ships should have armor strong enough to permit their use in the battle line.|$|E
