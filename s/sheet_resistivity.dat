Generally, only interconnections are made in the intermediate layers. The possibility of fabricating resistors along with interconnections in the buried layers/intermediate layers using conventional thick-film materials has been examined in this study. The fabrication has been carried out by processing layer after layer. It has been found that the buried layer resistors exhibited a <b>sheet</b> <b>resistivity</b> lower than those fabricated as open resistors.

Two InGaAsP/InP heterostructure compositions, with band gap wavelengths of 1. 3 lm and 1. 57 lm, were processed by ion implantation sequences done at multiple MeV energies and high 02 uence (1015 cm- 2). The optimization of the fabrica- tion process was {{closely related to the}} implantation temperature which in 02 uences the type of implant-induced defect structures. With hot implantation temperatures, at 373 K and 473 K, X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that dynamic defect annealing was strong and prevented the amorphization of the InGaAsP layers. These hot-implanted layers were less resistive and RTA could not optimize them systematically in favor of high resistivity. With cold implantation temperatures, at 83 K and even at 300 K, dynamic annealing was minimized. Damage clusters could form and accumulate to produce resis- tive amorphous-like structures. After recrystallization by RTA, polycrystalline signatures were found on every low-temperature Fe- and Ga-implanted structures.

The highest resistivities with a required temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) near zero ppm/K [roh(indTCR-greater than 0) ] are obtainable by incorporation of oxygen into the CrSi layer. Using partial reactive sputtering as a deposition process, resistivities [roh(indTCR-greater than 0) ] from 10 (exp 3) micro-Ohm-cm to 10 (exp 5) micro Ohm cm can be obtained with the same target composition. However, the reproducibility of the CrSi-O deposition process decreases and the resistance scattering of the devices increases with increasing partial pressure of oxygen. Thus, the maximum obtainable sheet resistance for technical processes is limited to about 10 k-Ohm/square when oxygen is used as the reactive gas. To overcome these problems depositions with various target compositions and oxygen-containing reactive gases such as carbon dioxide (C 02) or nitrous oxide (N 20) were performed using flat ceramics as substrates. Compared to depositions with 02 as reactive gas an improved process reproducibility and less resistance scattering has been observed, particularly when C 02 is used.
