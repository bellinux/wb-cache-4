Following ECAP, tensile specimens were {{cut from the}} as-pressed billets and tested at room temperature using an initial strain rate of 1 × 10 ? 4 s? 1. The surface morphology of these two materials was examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and {{it was found that}} long mesoscopic <b>shear</b> <b>planes</b> are formed in pure Al over a large fraction of the surface area but no mesoscopic <b>shear</b> <b>planes</b> are formed in the Zn- 22 % Al alloy. The results are examined with reference to earlier reports of the occurrence of mesoscopic <b>shear</b> <b>planes</b> in pure Cu and pure Ni after processing by ECAP. It is concluded that mesoscopic <b>shear</b> <b>planes</b> do not form in two-phase alloys because of the difficulties of achieving local re-arrangements of the grain boundaries and in other materials the extent of the mesoscopic <b>shear</b> <b>planes</b> depends upon the homologous testing temperature and the grain size of the material. <br/...|$|R

The laboratory test results were obtained by independent researchers for specimens where the applied loads were resisted by the 2 ̆ 2 block 2 ̆ 2 in shear only. The first set consists of five bolted connection specimens in the webs of wide flange sections where the tensile resistance planes had been sawn off. The second set consists of ten bolted connection specimens each in one leg of an angle section that had fractured completely along the net tensile plane through a block shear failure. Comparisons among the gross, net, and active <b>shear</b> <b>planes</b> against the independent laboratory test {{results showed that the}} critical <b>shear</b> <b>planes</b> of bolted connections were best represented by the active <b>shear</b> <b>planes</b> rather than either the gross or the net <b>shear</b> <b>planes.</b> It is also pointed out that full or almost full shear strain hardening was generally achieved at the ultimate limit state of block shear failure of bolted connections in hot-rolled steel plates or sections, irrespective of the connection length.

The active <b>shear</b> <b>planes</b> lie midway between the gross and the net <b>shear</b> <b>planes</b> defined in the steel structures specifications. The paper shows that shear yielding leading to the block shear failure of a bolted connection in a hot-rolled steel gusset plate is typically accompanied by full strain hardening. The paper proposes a design equation that provides more accurate and consistent results compared to the American, Australian, Canadian and European code equations in determining the block shear capacities of bolted connections in hot-rolled steel gusset plates.

In the cutting process, dislocation density in the <b>shearing</b> <b>plane</b> increases resulting in dislocation tangle and refining the grain size of the removed workpiece material. It makes the removed chip to be polycrystalline with the grain size in nanometer. After the diamond tool cutting through, stacking faults and the dislocations under the machined surface are not completely recovered causing a large number of point defects, TB, ISF, ESF, as well as different kinds of dislocations left in the machined subsurface. This phenomenon would deteriorate the generated surface roughness.

For a wide applicability low-cost materials with reasonable thermoelectric performances and cost-efficient preparation techniques are required. In this context metal oxides are an interesting class of materials because of their inherent high-temperature stability and relative high sustainability. Their thermoelectric performance, however, needs to be improved for wide application. Compounds with adaptive structures are a very interesting class of materials. A slight reduction of early transition metal oxides generates electrons as charge carriers and crystallographic <b>shear</b> <b>planes</b> as structure motif. The crystallographic <b>shear</b> <b>planes</b> lead to a reduction of intrinsic thermal conductivity. At the same time, the electronic transport properties can be tuned by the degree of reduction.

A transparent coagulated PTFE dispersion was used, in which the refractive indices of the continuous and dispersed phases were matched, for the formation of a gel. Coagulation was effected by adding NaCl to a concentration of 0. 5 M. Polystyrene particles were built into the gel structure as tracer particles. During steady-shear the velocities and trajectories of the tracer particles were analyzed by Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV). Indeed layers with approximately the same velocity were observed for a coagulated PTFE-gel, during steady-shear. Deviations from rectilinear motion of the tracer particles were observed. These observations correspond with the assumptions of the giant floc model in which the shear is not distributed homogeneously, but limited to certain <b>shear</b> <b>planes.</b> Deviations from rectilinear motion of the tracer particles in a dilute gel correspond with the results found by Folkersma et al.

As shear strain increases,there is a noticeable change in the pattern, from a broad peripheral maximum with its center against the shear sense, to a peripheral maximum that extends inward toward the pole figure center defining an axis that is rotated with the sense of shear, to a narrow single girdlerotated more strongly with the sense of shear that contains 2 elongate maxima at intermediate positions and, at the highest strain, a single maximum at the center. The visually estimated skeleton axis shows a progressive increase of θwith increasing shear strain, although the rate of increase is relatively low for γ≥ 5. It is obviously that there is a strong increase for γ＞4，corresponding to the achievement of significant recrystallization and the development of the single girdle and single maximum pattern.|$|E

5000|$|As earthflows {{are usually}} water-dependent, {{the risk of}} one {{occurring}} is much higher in humid areas especially {{after a period of}} heavy rainfall or snowmelt. [...] The high level of precipitation, which saturates the ground and adds water to the slope content, increases the pore-water pressure and reduces the shearing strength of the material. As the slope becomes wet, the earthflow may start as a creep downslope due to the clay or silt having less friction. As the material is increasingly more saturated, the slope will fail, which depends on slope stability. In earthflows, the slope does not fail along a clear <b>shear</b> <b>plane</b> and is instead more fluid as the material begins to move under the force of gravity as friction and slope stability is reduced.|$|E
50|$|In {{systems in}} which H+/OH&minus; are the {{interface}} potential-determining ions, {{the point of}} zero charge is given in terms of pH. The pH at which the surface exhibits a neutral net electrical charge {{is the point of}} zero charge at the surface. Electrokinetic phenomena generally measure zeta potential, and a zero zeta potential is interpreted as the point of zero net charge at the <b>shear</b> <b>plane.</b> This is termed the isoelectric point. Thus, the isoelectric point is the value of pH at which the colloidal particle remains stationary in an electrical field. The isoelectric point is expected to be somewhat different than the point of zero charge at the particle surface, but this difference is often ignored in practice for so-called pristine surfaces, i.e., surfaces with no specifically adsorbed positive or negative charges. In this context, specific adsorption is understood as adsorption occurring in a Stern layer or chemisorption. Thus, point of zero charge at the surface is taken as equal to isoelectric point in the absence of specific adsorption on that surface.|$|E

With the cutting direction of { 110 }[*]<[*] 001 >, the <b>shearing</b> <b>plane</b> is the twin boundary, as shown in Fig.  5 e, which expands under the tool edge. Therefore, large part of material flow up in front of the tool edge and small part of material flow to the side of the tool edge. Thus it can be seen that the side flow is influenced by the anisotropic nature of the material. At different cutting directions, the size of the side flow has great difference which would finally affect the machined surface quality. Therefore, the cutting directions of { 100 }[*]<[*] 011 >, { 110 }[*]<[*] 001 >, and { 110 }[*]<[*] 1 – 10 [*]>[*]are beneficial to obtain a better surface quality.
