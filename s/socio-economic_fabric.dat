40|$|This paper {{argues in}} defence of {{the thesis that}} the Machiavellian {{principle}} of the “the end justifies the means” is the philosophical basis of wealth acquisition for some Nigerians. The paper strongly argues that the philosophy of wealth acquisition currently in vogue for some Nigerians today is the philosophy of “steal and grow rich but don’t be caught” and maintains {{that this is a}} direct offshoot of the Machiavellian principle of “the end justifies the means”, where the end is made a justification of any means to the end in question. Our paper argues that the Machiavellian philosophy of wealth acquisition is the bedrock on which corruption (the cankerworm that has eaten deep into the <b>socio-economic</b> <b>fabrics</b> of Nigeria) is built. This is so because the principle of “steal and grow rich but don’t be caught” which is a reformulation of the Machiavellian principle of “the end justifies the means” strongly propels the actions of corrupt Nigerians. This Machiavellian philosophy, our paper insists, makes some Nigerians to think that it is almost impossible for anyone to acquire wealth in Nigeria today without getting involved in one shady deal or another. As a result of this Machiavellian philosophy of wealth acquisition, some Nigerians today believe that moral uprightness and wealth acquisition are two parallel lines that can never meet. Consequently, in their distorted opinion, those who want to be morally upright must give up the ambition of becoming wealthy because, according to them, it is for the corrupt. And those who want to be wealthy must give up the possibility of moral uprightness because, according to them, it does not promote wealth. Our paper strongly argues for a total rejection of the Machiavellian philosophy of wealth acquisition. In its place, the paper emphasizes and recommends principles for the acquisition of morally upright wealth in Nigeria. Key words: Philosophy; Wealth Acquisition; Nigeria</p...|$|R

40|$|Through {{presenting}} {{the cases of}} Tijuana in Mexico and Istanbul in Turkey this chapter explores the local processes triggered by the discourse on transit migration and the dispositif (Foucault, 1980) it activated at the urban level in two so called ‘transit countries’. Although the presence of foreign residents is hardly acknowledged and the challenges it poses to existing urban social, spatial and economic assets are not problematized, both cities multiplied their efforts to fight irregular immigration by introducing repressive measures and tight controls. By enlarging the picture to the two macro-regional contexts, i. e.

The agricultural sector has a multiplier effect on any nation's <b>socio-economic</b> and industrial <b>fabric</b> because of the multifunctional nature of agriculture. The main objective {{of this study was}} to investigate how government expenditure on agriculture has affected economic growth in Zimbabwe from 1980 - 2009. The Log linear growth regression model was employed where gross domestic gross was the dependant variable and the explanatory variables are the factors which affect it which include government agricultural expenditure. The expenditures of government on agriculture were divided into three functions namely extension, credit assistance and R & D. The regression analyses were performed using Econometric-views 7 (E-views 7) statistical package. Regression was carried out on time series data for the period 1980 to 2009. The data was tested for stationarity and for autocorrelation. Problems of non stationarity of data were corrected by integrating the trending series. Results from the empirical analysis provide strong evidence indicating that agriculture is an engine of economic growth. The results from this study suggest that spending more on agricultural research and development can improve economic growth and ultimately reduce poverty. However, it can also be concluded that insufficient government agricultural expenditure on extension and credit assistance adversely affected economic growth in Zimbabwe, based on the results of the study. Global experience with pro-poor growth and empirical work spanning India, Benin and Malawi demonstrates the importance of agricultural expenditure for poverty reduction in poor rural areas, while also pointing to the need for complementary non farm sector growth. This study also proposes a simple methodology to estimate the agricultural spending that will be required to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving poverty by 2015 (MDG 1) in Zimbabwe. This method uses growth poverty and growth expenditure elasticities to estimate the financial resources required to meet the MDG 1.

40|$|This thesis {{has eight}} chapters, each {{organised}} according to interwoven themes that permit easy linkages between the salient {{questions of the}} study. The thesis utilises a multi-disciplinary approach {{in the analysis of}} deprivation occasioned by scarcity. The concept of masculinity is also crucial for understanding the issues related to violence escalation, conflict management and peace in Mbale, Uganda. Employing qualitative methodologies, the study examines the way that violence in Mbale has been understood by the survivors, perpetrators, witnesses and state officials. The study analyses the experiences of those involved in these violent conflict situations and seeks to understand the way in which scarce resources and violent masculinity among the Bagisu people impact upon the dynamics of conflict, particularly in terms of violence escalation, conflict management and peace development in the area. The study also seeks to understand why the various processes and structures of government, civil society and traditional authority failed to prevent widespread violence. Subsequently, I examine the questions of effective conflict management, both as a deterrent to violence and as a means of maintaining the peace necessary for sustainable development. I examine the efficacy of alternative policies that might promote a wider, more inclusive and more gender sensitive strategy towards conflict management that might fully tap into the existing and powerful resources within the <b>socio-economic</b> and political <b>fabric</b> for promoting sustainable peace and development. Whilst many commentators would posit witchcraft as a major factor behind the violence, others would stress the importance of socio-economic deprivation, scarcity and violent masculinity as factors contributing to the dynamics of the Mbale violence and its management. The thesis concurs with the latter assessment, exposing violent masculinity and scarcity as powerful influences for the dynamics and management of conflict and violence in Mbale. Violent masculinity inculcates a culture of violent conflict, whilst economic scarcity and deprivation acted as social catalysts for its explosive manifestation. Whilst the violent struggle witnessed in Mbale officially came to an end in 1996, the road to peace was still long and far from easy, having major repercussions, not only for the socio-economic and political developments of the area, but also for the East African region as a whole. A decade on and there have been no significant initiatives to secure 'peace', neither from community leaders nor from responsible government departments, which thereby poses serious questions concerning the sustainability of peace and development, given their inextricable fate. Peace is a vital component to a country's further development: sustainable development requires a peaceful environment. Although this study recognises the importance of formal structures for peace keeping and its maintenance, it also recognises that where such institutionalised structures are not fully developed, {{as in the case of}} Mbale, then alternative initiatives tapping into existing grass-root traditions must be employed as supplemental capacities for bringing about and maintaining lasting peace and sustainable development...|$|R

40|$|From the Introduction]. Over {{the past}} decade and a half Austria {{experienced}} no less than two exogenous shocks and one endogenous shock, each of which was capable of throwing into turmoil the country’s political and economic system as it had existed since the end of World War II. The collapse of the Iron Curtain, Austria’s integration into the Single European Market, and the rapid rise of the radical populist right threatened the existing <b>socio-economic</b> and political <b>fabric</b> precisely because the country had always been regarded as a model of ultra-stability. Yet, unlike, for example, the Italian Partitocrazia, where the end of the Cold War triggered a complete collapse of the ancien regime, Austria’s political arrangements survived into the late 1990 s. Even thereafter, the system managed to adapt, preserving several of its key elements. Unlike fellow corporatist Sweden, whose economy and economic system underwent a major crisis in the 1990 s, Austria emerged from the difficult process of internationalization without a similar disruption. Instead, change came gradually and largely in an organized fashion. Moreover, unlike Germany, Austria’s large northern neighbor, most important trading partner, and erstwhile role model, the Alpine nation continually managed to combine low unemployment with a reasonably solid economic performance. Since 1999, Austria surpassed (West) Germany in terms of per capita economic output, while maintaining unemployment at rates lower than most OECD countries. Although the jobless rate never exceeded 4. 5 % (even in the recent recession), the Austrian government managed to presented a balanced budget by 2001; a goal which had seemed unattainable just a few years earlier. Moreover, compared with Germany, Austria boosts a higher per capita purchasing power (€ 17, 699 vs. 17, 087), lower corporate taxes (25 % vs. 39 %), longer working hours (1750 vs. 1786), and a better earnings-to-productivity ratio (1 : 1. 8 vs 1 : 1. 2). In fact, when adjusted for purchasing power parity, Austria, along with Luxembourg, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, is now among the richest member states of the European Union, surpassing even such successful economies as Sweden, Finland, and Belgium. A cross-national study released in 2005, which compared 1207 regions in 25 EU countries, found that five of the top 20 areas were located in Austria. Overall, the Alpine Republic took the second rank after only Ireland. Yet, Austria’s relative success at adapting itself to new political and economic realities was neither a foregone conclusion nor free from severe problems and moments of crisis. Only five years ago, Austria found itself under political sanctions by its 14 EU partners and faced an uncertain political future. This paper is an attempt to provide an overview of Austria’s coping mechanisms and seeks to explain their considerable success. Furthermore, the article also argues that the simultaneity of three major challenges - integration, the end of the Cold War, {{and the rise of the}} radical right - each served to stabilize certain components of the Austrian model at a critical juncture, while other elements were undergoing a necessary transformation. In many ways, the different shocks not only induced change but also served to mutually reinforce the Austrian system enough to allow for both a gradual and sequential adaptation...|$|R
