40|$|Semicokes {{obtained}} from the pyrolysis of petroleum pitches are important materials {{that are used in}} the manufacture of many carbonaceous products. Therefore, new structural information of the <b>semi-cokes</b> will extend their utilization. The structural analysis of anisotropic semicokes of the pyrolysis of petroleum pitches obtained under various experimental conditions of temperature and time was investigated. The overall objective is to provide further detailed information of factors which influence formation of anisotropy or turbostratic structures in resultant semicokes. Experiments were carried out under an argon atmosphere at the temperature range of 500 - 1000 degrees C for 30, 60 and 120 min in a tube furnace. FTIR, H- 1 -NMR, and C- 13 NMR results showed that the aromatic structure of the semicokes was increasing with respect to increasing temperature as well as increasing time. Aromaticity of the semicokes was calculated as 0. 54 and 0. 64, for Pitch A at 500 degrees C after 120 min, and Pitch B at 600 degrees C after 120 min, respectively. The intensity ratio between Raman "D" and "G" peaks, I-D/I-G (commonly used to characterize disorder in graphene structures) was observed to increase approximately linearly from 0. 65 to 0. 92 when the pyrolysis temperature of Pitch A was increased from 500 degrees C to 900 degrees C. XRD patterns of the semicokes showed the formation of some crystalline material with time and temperature. The average number of layers, calculated by the Debye-Scherer technique using the XRD patterns of the semicokes, was between 5 and 10. SEM images of the semicokes indicated the presence of turbostratic structures. All the results of characterizations were consistent and indicated the formation of highly amorphous hydrocarbon materials that contain turbostratic structures. Treatments at higher temperatures increased formations of aromatic structure with increased crystallinity. Temperature seemed to be the dominating parameter of the pyrolysis reactions. As the pyrolysis temperature was increased, aromatic structure formation was favored with increased crystallinity in the semicokes. We expect that findings of the present work will open new uses for the anisotropic semicokes {{obtained from}} petroleum pitches. The pitches can be widely applied to the templating synthesis of carbon nanostructures and other carbon nanomaterials...|$|R

5000|$|The [...] Galoter process (also {{known as}} TSK, UTT, or SHC; its newest {{modifications}} are called Enefit and Petroter) is a shale oil extraction technology for {{a production of}} shale oil, a type of synthetic crude oil. In this process, the oil shale is decomposed into shale oil, oil shale gas, and spent residue. A decomposition is caused by mixing raw oil shale with a hot oil shale ash, generated by combustion of carbonaceous residue (<b>semi-coke)</b> in the spent residue. The process was developed in 1950s and it is used commercially for the shale oil production in Estonia.

5000|$|The {{process was}} {{developed}} to combine the shale oil production with production of sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, and aluminum from nahcolite and dawsonite, occurring in oil shales of the Piceance Basin. [...] In this process, the nahcolite is recovered from the raw oil shale by crushing it to lumps smaller than 8 in. As a result, most of the nahcolite in the oil shale becomes a fine powder what could screened out. Screened oil shale lumps are further crushed to particles smaller than 3 in. [...] Oil shale particles are further processed in a horizontal segmented doughnut-shaped traveling-grate retort in the direct or indirect heating mode. [...] The retort was originally designed by Davy McKee Corporation for iron ore pelletizing and it {{also known as the}} Dravo retort. In the direct retort, oil shale moves past ducts through which are provided hot inert gas for heating the raw oil shale, air for combustion of carbon residue (char or <b>semi-coke)</b> in the spent oil shale, and cold inert gas for cooling the spent oil shale. [...] The oil pyrolysis takes place in the heating section. To minimize solubility of aluminium compounds in the oil shale, the heat control is a crucial factor. Necessary heat for pyrolysis is generated in the carbon recovery section by combustion of carbon residue (char or <b>semi-coke)</b> remained in the spent oil shale. While blowing inert gases through the spent oil shale, the spent oil shale is cooled and gases are heated to cause pyrolysis. The indirect mode is similar; the difference is that combustion of carbonaceous residue takes place in separate vessel. The last section is for discharging of oil shale ash.
