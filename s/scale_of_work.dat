As quickly as possible, the Americans replaced or upgraded the old, unusable French equipment with new construction equipment that was designed for a much larger and faster <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> About 102 new large, railroad-mounted steam shovels were purchased from the Marion Power Shovel Company and brought from the United States. These were joined by enormous steam-powered cranes, giant hydraulic rock crushers, cement mixers, dredges, and pneumatic power drills, nearly all of which were manufactured by new, extensive machine-building technology developed and built in the United States. The railroad also had to be comprehensively upgraded with heavy-duty, double-tracked rails over most of the line to accommodate new rolling stock. In many places, the new Gatun Lake flooded over the original rail line, and a new line had to be constructed above Gatun Lake's waterline.|$|E

40|$|The {{saw-tooth}} <b>scaling</b> investigations <b>of</b> <b>work</b> functions (WF) in hydrogenated graphene are theoretically {{performed by}} density functional theory. The positions of hydrogen atoms and the H/C ratios affect WF. With {{the comparison of}} different graphene structures by adsorbed two hydrogen atoms, WF is larger with less negative charges of the graphene. With different H/C ratios, WF is controlled by two parts: the graphene surface and hydrogen groups. When the ratio is smaller than 0. 5, the work func-tion is more dependent on the Mulliken charge of graphene. With more hydrogen atoms, the surface of graphene is more negative, resulting in a smaller work function. When the ratio is larger than 0. 5, the effect of hydrogen groups cannot be ignored. When two sides of graphene have different numbers of hy-drogen atoms, a dipole exists, making the movement of electron from Fermi level to vacuum level more difficult, thus WF is larger than that with the same hydrogen atoms of each side. Therefore the <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> function acts like a saw-tooth dependent on H/C ratio...|$|R

5000|$|The mass {{methods of}} work favoured at the {{beginning}} of collectivization were rapidly found to be inefficient. A huge column of ploughs simultaneously tilling a field might appear a glamorous example of large-scale socialist agriculture. But if just one plough broke down, the work-pattern of the whole column was disrupted. Also, in large brigades, accounting was complicated and supervision difficult. The favoured size of the primary working unit progressively shrank. As early as March 1930 columns of 15-20 ploughs were acknowledged to be more efficient than those with 70. By the beginning of 1933 even this <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> was a rarity. By this time [...] "mass work" [...] came in the shape of zvenya of 3-5 horse-drawn [...] "machines". In the 1932 harvest, in large collective farms the typical zveno was composed of just one reaping machine, with 6-8 people binding the grain behind it.|$|E

50|$|Even {{before the}} {{construction}} of the T-33, it was decided to increase the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> dedicated to creating an amphibious tank. In addition to the Leningrad OKMO, the Number 2 plant of the All-Soviet Automotive Union (VATO), which was already producing armored vehicles for the Red Army, was relegated to the development and production of amphibious armored vehicles. As a result, at the 2nd VATO plant, under the supervision of N. N. Kozyrev, the T-41 amphibious tank was produced, weighing 3.5 tons and using the GAZ-AA engine, which was based on the T-27 power plant. The transmission was nearly identical to that of the T-27, and to the power take-off for the propeller, they added a rigid gear clutch. Its construction for turning off the propeller demanded stopping the tank and turning off the engine. The chassis was, in part, borrowed from the T-33, and the caterpillar tracks were entirely from the T-27. Leningrad builders likewise continued the development of a more suitable amphibious tank, and they designated their latest model as the “T-37”. It had the same GAZ AA engine as the T-41, the same transmission, wide use of automotive parts, and the Krupp chassis, which Soviet engineers first encountered {{as a result of a}} technological partnership with Weimar Germany. Although the T-41 was actually produced for the military in small numbers, after testing and battlefield trials the T-37 was denied production due to various minor faults and an incomplete development process.|$|E
