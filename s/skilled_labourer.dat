6000|$|This {{plan has}} been found necessary, {{in order to protect}} the Coolies both from {{themselves}} and from each other. They themselves prefer receiving the whole of their wages in cash. With that fondness for mere hard money which marks a half-educated Oriental, they will, as a rule, hoard their wages; and stint themselves of food, injuring their powers of work, and even endangering their own lives; as is proved by the broad fact that the death-rate among them has much decreased, especially during the first year of residence, since the plan of giving them rations has been at work. The newcomers need, too, protection from their own countrymen. Old Coolies who have served their time and saved money find it convenient to turn rice- sellers or money-lenders. They have powerful connections on many estates; they first advance money or luxuries to a newcomer, and when he is once entrapped, they sell him the necessaries of life at famine prices. Thus the practical effect of rations has been to lessen the number of those little roadside shops, which were a curse to Trinidad, and are still a curse to the English workman. [...] Moreover--for all men are not perfect, even in Trinidad--the Coolie required protection, in certain cases, against a covetous and short- sighted employer, who might fancy it to be his interest to let the man idle during his first year, while weak, and so save up an arrear of 'lost days' to be added at the end of the five years, when he was a strong <b>skilled</b> <b>labourer.</b> An employer will have, of course, far less temptation to do this, while, as now, he is bound to feed the Coolie for the first two years. Meanwhile, be it remembered, the very fact that such a policy was tempting, goes to prove that the average Coolie grew, during his five years' apprenticeship, a stronger, and not a weaker, man.|$|E

Palla paid 300 florins for the altarpiece, or about six times the annual salary of a <b>skilled</b> <b>labourer.</b> According to Baldwin both Palla Strozzi and his father, Onofrio, appear in the painting − Palla as the man in the red hat in the forefront of the painting, and Onofrio as the falcon trainer situated behind the youngest king. According to other opinions, the falcon trainer depicts the commissioner Palla Strozzi with his eldest son Lorenzo to his right. Finished in 1423, the {{painting was}} placed in the new chapel of the church of Santa Trinita which Lorenzo Ghiberti was executing in these years.The works shows both the international and Sienese schools' influences on Gentile's art, combined with the Renaissance novelties he knew in Florence. The panel portrays the path of the three Magi, in several scenes which start from the upper left corner (the voyage and the entrance into Bethlehem) and continue clockwise, to the larger meeting with the Virgin Mary and the newborn Jesus which occupies the lowest part of the picture. All the figures wear splendid Renaissance costumes, brocades richly decorated with real gold and precious stones inserted in the panel. Gentile's typical attention for detail is also evident in the exotic animals, such as a leopard, a dromedary, some apes and a lion, as well as the magnificent horses and a hound.|$|E

This study analyses the present situation of the construction industry in Sri Lanka with respect to <b>skilled</b> <b>labourer</b> by assessing the need {{to increase the number of}} skilled labourers and their skill level by identifying the causes and effects of the shortage of skilled labour. This paper summarises the results of a survey conducted in Sri Lanka and propose mitigation measures to rectify the problem. This is a timely and needful study in the present context of Sri Lanka with the expected rapid growth of the construction industry especially after the end of the civil war. The objectives of this study are to identify the causes for the shortage of skilled labour in the Sri Lankan construction industry, the resulting effects due to the shortage and to come up with effective mitigation measures. The research was conducted via two types of questionnaire surveys, namely; the individual surveys and the institutional surveys among contractors, consultants and clients represented by Architects, Engineers, Quantity Surveyors, Technical Officers and other similar grades. A project wise analysis was carried out through the institutional questionnaire survey. To support the findings of this research, present salary scales of selected skilled labour types were compared with salary scales of similar overseas opportunities. Categories of skille...|$|E
40|$|Purpose This paper aims {{to offer}} the {{aerodynamic}} testing community a new procedure for manufacturing high-quality aerodynamic probes suitable for 3 D flow measurements with consistent geometry and calibration {{by taking advantage of}} the additive manufacturing technology. Design/methodology/approach The design methodology combines the advantages and flexibilities of computer aided design (CAD) /computer aided manufacturing (CAM) along with the use of computational fluid dynamics to design and analyse suitable probe shapes prior to manufacturing via rapid prototyping. Findings A viable procedure to design and possibly batch manufacture geometrically accurate pneumatic probes with consistent calibration is shown to be possible through this work. Multi-jet modelling prototyping methods with wax-based support materials are found to be a cost-effective method when clean and long sub-millimetre pressure channels are to be cut. Originality/value Utilisation of the geometry consistency that is made possible by 3 D printing technology for the design and development of pneumatic probes is described. It is suggested that the technique could lead to batch production of identical probes, thus avoiding precious time of a <b>skilled</b> <b>labourer</b> and elaborate individual calibration requirement...|$|E

Construction industry further contributes to employment, household income and economic growth. Activities in this sector shows that increased productivity in the construction industry will result in increased economic growth. Further increase or activities in this industry will absorb more of semi-skilled and unskilled labours more compared to highly <b>skilled</b> <b>labourer</b> within the sector. High income household will benefit more from construction industry activities followed by medium income households with low income households benefitting less. Clearly, highly skilled labourers are occupants of high income households and the study therefore shows that though few labours is absorbed from high skilled labour market, they benefit more in terms of income. However, noting the impact construction industry is able to make in the economy, further investment in infrastructure is encouraged as it results in more construction activities which have both the short to long term economic benefits to the country.
