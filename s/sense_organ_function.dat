50|$|Adrenergic fibres {{innervate}} smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, visceral glands, {{and various}} {{central nervous system}} structures and <b>sense</b> <b>organs.</b> Their <b>function</b> is enhancing, compared to the inhibiting action of the cholinergic fibres of the parasympathetic system. Peripheral adrenergic neurons integrate signals from other nerves of {{the central nervous system}} and peripheral <b>sense</b> <b>organs.</b> An adrenergic nerve impulse is triggered when one nerve fires repeatedly or when several nerves fire simultaneously which can cause an additive effect leading to a greater stimulus. Adrenergic neurons, in particular the α2 autorecptors found in the brain, are also involved in sexual behavior and in the control of appetite.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{investigates the}} status of the body as an image and its new forms of {{cultural}} coding. The first part analyses, from the historical point of view, the dualism of the relation soul/body marking the essential changes that it had experimented through the history of the occidental thinking. As an example, modern philosophy introduces a change of perspective by representing a soul immanent to a body like an essence immanent to a phenomenon. This gradually leads to the idea that what makes us unique and gives us individual identity is in fact our body since it is the body itself that renders the generically universal consciousness a self-consciousness. The next step analyses the mutation from body-communication to communication-body relation, from the idea of body-language to body-communication witch was possible and could only develop in an environment dedicated to the therapy of interpersonal relationships or, generally speaking, of communication. The last part of the text develops the idea of the Swiss anthropologist Adolf Portmann in which the surface of the body is not a simple protective coat but a special <b>sense</b> <b>organ</b> that <b>functions</b> in the most various ways, primarily to create an appearance defined as what is visible, what is actually being revealed...|$|R
50|$|Umesao also {{developed}} theories on the increasing importance of “information” {{as a social}} phenomenon, combining concepts of animal embryology and civilization history. In his “Information Industry Theory: Dawn of the Coming Era of the Ectodermal Industry” (1963), he claimed that following the agricultural age (that {{is comparable to the}} endodermic stage in embryology where the digestive system is formed) and the industrial age (which is the mesodermic stage where the bones, muscles and circulatory system appear), a new society will form around the information industry. He argued that with the development of mass media and computers, information will become an important economic factor, and that this was equivalent to the ectodermal stage where the brain, nerves and <b>sense</b> <b>organs</b> come to <b>function.</b> He was thus one of the earliest to predict the coming of the Information Age. His pioneering contribution was recognized with the C & C Prize funded by the NEC Corporation in 2002.|$|R
40|$|The cut gene of Drosophila melanogaster is an {{identity}} selector gene that establishes {{the program of}} development and differentiation of external <b>sense</b> <b>organs.</b> Mutations in the cut gene cause a transformation of the external <b>sense</b> <b>organs</b> into chordotonal organs, originally assessed {{by the use of}} immunostaining methods [Bodmer et al. (1987) : Cell, 51 : 293 - 307]. Because of evidence that axonal projections of the transformed neurons within the central nervous system are not completely switched in cut mutants, the transformation of the four cells making up a <b>sense</b> <b>organ</b> was reassessed using single-cell staining with fluorescent dye and differential interface contrast (DIC) microscopy of the embryo and larva. The results provide strong evidence that all cells of the <b>sense</b> <b>organs</b> are completely transformed, exhibiting the morphologies and organelles characteristic of chordotonal <b>sense</b> <b>organs.</b> A comparison of the structures of external <b>sense</b> <b>organs</b> and chordotonal organs indicates that a number of the differences could be due to the degree of development of common structures, and that cut or downstream genes modulate effector genes that are normally utilized in both receptor types. The possible derivation of insect chordotonal and external <b>sense</b> <b>organs</b> from a receptor type found in crustaceans is discussed in the light of arthropod phylogenetics and the molecular genetics of <b>sense</b> <b>organ</b> development.

40|$|Adults of Romanomermis culicivorax {{obtained}} from mass cultures were examined by scanning and {{transmission electron microscopy}} to determine the organization of their anterior <b>sense</b> <b>organs.</b> The normal pattern apparently consists of two lateral amphids plus six cephalic papillae.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the structure and}} function of pox neuro (poxn), a gene previously isolated by virtue of a conserved domain, the paired box, which it shares with the segmentation genes paired and gooseberry. Its expression pattern has been analyzed, particularly during development of the PNS. We propose that poxn is a "neuroblast identity" gene acting in both the PNS and the CNS {{on the basis of}} the following evidence. Its expression is restricted to four neuronal precursors in each hemisegment: two neuronal stem cells (neuro-blasts) in the CNS, and two sensory mother cells (SMCs) in the PNS. The SMCs that express poxn produce the poly-innervated external <b>sense</b> <b>organs</b> of the larva. In poxn- embryos, poly-innervated <b>sense</b> <b>organs</b> are transformed into mono-innervated. Conversely, ectopic expression of poxn in embryos transformed with a heat-inducible poxn gene can switch mono-innervated to poly-innervated <b>sense</b> <b>organs.</b> Expression of poxn in the wing disc is restricted to the SMCs of the poly-innervated <b>sense</b> <b>organs,</b> suggesting that poxn also determines the lineage of poly-innervated adult <b>sense</b> <b>organs.</b> © 1992 by Cell Press.

40|$|The {{homeotic}} genes are instrumental in establishing segment-specific characteristics. In Drosophila embryos {{there is ample}} evidence that the {{homeotic genes}} are involved in establishing the differences in the pattern of <b>sense</b> <b>organs</b> between segments. The chordotonal <b>organs</b> are compound <b>sense</b> <b>organs</b> made up of several stretch receptive sensilla. A set of serially homologous chordotonal organs, Ich 3 in the 1 (st) thoracic segment, dch 3 in the 2 (nd) and 3 (rd) thoracic segments and Ich 5 in abdominal segments 1 to 7, is composed of different numbers of sensilla with different positions and orientations. Here we examine this set of <b>sense</b> <b>organs</b> and a companion set, vchA/B and vch 1, in the wild type and mutants for Sex combs reduced, Antennapedia, Ultrabithorax, and abdominal-A, using immunostaining. Mutant phenotypes indicate that Ultrabithorax and abdominal-A in particular influence the formation of these <b>sense</b> <b>organs.</b> Differential expression of abdominal-A and Ultrabithorax within compartments of individual parasegments can precisely modulate the types of <b>sense</b> <b>organs</b> that will arise from a segment...|$|R
5000|$|The {{vertebrate}} {{nervous system}} {{is divided into}} the central and peripheral nervous systems. The central nervous system (CNS) consists of the brain, retina, and spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system (PNS) {{is made up of}} all the nerves outside of the CNS that connect it {{to the rest of the}} body. The PNS is further subdivided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The somatic nervous system is made up of [...] "afferent" [...] neurons, which bring sensory information from the <b>sense</b> <b>organs</b> to the CNS, and [...] "efferent" [...] neurons, which carry motor instructions out to the muscles. The autonomic nervous system also has two subdivisions, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic, which are important for regulating the body's basic internal <b>organ</b> <b>functions</b> such as heartbeat, breathing, digestion, and salivation. Autonomic nerves, like somatic nerves, contain afferent and efferent fibers.|$|R
