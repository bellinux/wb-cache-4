5|$|Cooper {{served as}} a DH-4 bomber pilot with the United States Army Air Service during World War I. On September 26, 1918, his plane was shot down. The plane caught fire, and Cooper <b>spun</b> <b>the</b> plane to suck the flames out. Cooper survived, {{although}} he suffered burns, injured his hands, and was presumed dead. German soldiers saw his plane's incredible landing {{and took him to}} a prisoner reserve hospital.|$|E
5|$|Hedley Verity (18 May 1905– 31 July 1943) was a {{professional}} cricketer who played for Yorkshire and England between 1930 and 1939. A slow left-arm orthodox bowler, he took 1,956wickets in first-class cricket {{at an average of}} 14.90 and 144 wickets in 40Tests at an average of 24.37. Named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1932, he is {{regarded as one of the}} most effective slow left-arm bowlers to have played cricket. Never someone who <b>spun</b> <b>the</b> ball sharply, he achieved success through the accuracy of his bowling. On pitches which made batting difficult, particularly ones affected by rain, he could be almost impossible to bat against.|$|E
5000|$|When {{a player}} plays a [...] "spin" [...] card, the next player must <b>spin</b> <b>the</b> {{provided}} wheel, {{instead of taking}} a normal turn, which holds the [...] "draw" [...] and [...] "discard" [...] deck. There is no rule that tells the player which way to <b>spin</b> <b>the</b> wheel, although <b>spinning</b> <b>the</b> wheel clockwise is preferred by seasoned players.|$|R
5000|$|A {{deterministic}} {{version of}} Toom's rule can be stated simply as:At each {{site in the}} lattice if <b>the</b> <b>spin</b> of <b>the</b> current (center) site plus <b>the</b> neighboring <b>spin</b> to <b>the</b> North plus <b>the</b> neighboring <b>spin</b> to <b>the</b> East is greater than 0, then <b>the</b> current <b>spin</b> has <b>the</b> <b>spin</b> +1 in <b>the</b> next time step. Toom's rule is sometimes called the NEC rule since it involves the North, East, and Center sites. If this sum is less than 0, then <b>the</b> current <b>spin</b> has <b>spin</b> -1 in <b>the</b> next time step. As there are 3 <b>spins</b> <b>the</b> sum can never equal 0.|$|R

5|$|Bernhard {{was caught}} by Duval and used his car's hybrid boost system on the Kemmel straight, moving ahead of the German under braking for Les Combes corner. Fässler briefly {{pressured}} Bernhard before entering the pit lane for a scheduled stop and Lotterer took over his seat. Lotterer lapped in the 1:58 second range which allowed him to run 12 seconds behind race leader Dumas. Bonanomi's left-hand window became detached on the Kemmel straight, necessitating an extra pit stop for a replacement window. Patrick Dempsey <b>spun</b> <b>the</b> No. 77 car at the Bus Stop chicane, forcing several drivers to take avoiding action. Trummer drove into his garage with back-end technical problems with his car and retired. Dempsey's co-driver Marco Seefried spun and heavily struck the left-hand turn tyre barrier before Pouhon corner.|$|E
5|$|During {{the yellow}} flag period, some cars elected to make pit stops, and Ricardo González <b>spun</b> <b>the</b> No. 43 RGR Sport Ligier. The No. 7 Audi rejoined the race after repairs to its floor which was damaged {{when the car}} drove over a kerb and its ducts {{required}} cleaning after rubber picked up from the circuit caused the vehicle to overheat. The entry rejoined in 15th place overall. The race restarted 12 minutes later with Davidson leading the field, ahead of the No. 8 Audi. Kobayashi immediately got ahead of Dumas to move into third position. Manor's No. 31 entry driven by Richard Bradley overtook the No. 31 Extreme Speed Motorsports car of Chris Cumming at Eau Rouge for fourth place in LMP2. Nathanaël Berthon's No. 26 vehicle had its left-rear tyre punctured following contact with Abu Dhabi Proton's No. 88 Porsche at La Source, while Andy Priaulx in the No. 67 Ford passed Dempsey-Proton's No. 77 car for fifth place in LMGTE Pro. Berthon went off the track at the Bus Stop chicane while attempting to drive into the pit lane.|$|E
25|$|The zoetrope {{works on}} the same {{principle}} as its predecessor, the phenakistoscope, but is more convenient and allows the animation to be viewed by several people at the same time. Instead of being radially arrayed on a disc, the sequence of pictures depicting phases of motion is on a paper strip. For viewing, this is placed against the inner surface of {{the lower part of}} an open-topped metal drum, the upper part of which is provided with a vertical viewing slit across from each picture. The drum, on a spindle base, is <b>spun.</b> <b>The</b> faster the drum is <b>spun,</b> <b>the</b> smoother the animation appears.|$|E
50|$|The energy {{required}} to <b>spin</b> <b>the</b> CaH molecule from {{its lowest level}} to the first quantum level corresponds to a microwave frequency, so there is an absorption around 253 GHz. However, <b>the</b> <b>spin</b> of <b>the</b> molecule is also affected by <b>the</b> <b>spin</b> of an unpaired electron on the calcium, and <b>the</b> <b>spin</b> of <b>the</b> proton in the hydrogen. <b>The</b> electron <b>spin</b> leads to splitting of the line by about 1911.7 MHz, and <b>the</b> <b>spin</b> relative to <b>the</b> proton <b>spin</b> results in hyperfine splitting of the line by about 157.3 MHz.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{graveyard}} <b>spin</b> is {{an illusion}} that can occur to a pilot who enters a spin. For example, a pilot who enters a <b>spin</b> to <b>the</b> left will initially have a sensation of <b>spinning</b> in <b>the</b> same direction. However, if <b>the</b> left <b>spin</b> continues <b>the</b> pilot will have the sensation that <b>the</b> <b>spin</b> is progressively decreasing. At this point, if the pilot applies right rudder to stop <b>the</b> left <b>spin,</b> <b>the</b> pilot will suddenly sense a <b>spin</b> in <b>the</b> opposite direction (to the right).|$|R

25|$|The {{subsequent}} 1990–91 {{version of}} the show used a redesigned {{version of the}} Star Wheel.

The prize was doubled if the pointer stopped on either of two circles within each section.|$|E
25|$|A {{controversy}} developed when Kumar Sangakkara {{called the}} toss. The toss came up as heads, but the match referee Jeff Crowe {{did not hear}} the call over the crowd.

25|$|Three's Company {{had many}} cast changes over its run. The {{first of these}} changes {{took place in the}} spring of 1979 with the {{relocation}} of the Ropers to their own television series (The Ropers), which revolved around Helen and Stanley, and their neighbors in a townhouse community after Stanley had sold the apartment building. Man About The House had similarly <b>spun</b> <b>the</b> Ropers off for the series George and Mildred.|$|E
50|$|The rollers {{act as the}} “threads” of the nut assembly, causing axial {{movement}} of the rotating screw due to their orbital restraint. Screw rotation <b>spins</b> <b>the</b> rollers, which <b>spin</b> <b>the</b> bearing ring, dissipating the load-induced friction along the way.|$|R
50|$|Some seeders/spreaders have {{directional}} fins {{to control}} {{the direction of the}} material that is thrown from the spreader. All broadcast spreaders require some form of power to <b>spin</b> <b>the</b> disk. On hand carried units, a hand crank spins gears to turn the disk. On tow behind units, <b>the</b> wheels <b>spin</b> a shaft that turns gears which, in turn, <b>spin</b> <b>the</b> disk. As is partially visible in one of the photos, with tractor mounted units, a mechanical P.T.O. shaft connected to the tractor and controlled by <b>the</b> tractor operator, <b>spins</b> <b>the</b> disk. There are some seeder/spreaders made for garden size tractors that use a 12 volt motor to <b>spin</b> <b>the</b> dispersing disk and yaw.|$|R
50|$|Finally <b>the</b> player <b>spins</b> <b>the</b> wheel. <b>Spinning</b> <b>the</b> BUST wedge, {{if there}} is one, {{eliminates}} the player, and any other wedge produces the applicable amount of winnings. A player could theoretically win as much as $60,000 (that is, 5 &times; 2 &times; 5 &times; ($200 + $400 + $600)) by answering all questions correctly in Rounds 1 to 3, spinning gold each time, getting at least one right answer in the Endgame, finding the &times;5 button, and <b>spinning</b> <b>the</b> corresponding wedge.|$|R
25|$|After {{the launch}} on July 28, 1973, and {{entering}} Skylab, the spiders were released by astronaut Owen Garriott {{into a box}} that resembled a window frame. The spiders proceeded to construct their web while a camera took photographs and examined the spiders' behavior in a zero-gravity environment. Both spiders {{took a long time}} to adapt to their weightless existence. However, after a day, Arabella <b>spun</b> <b>the</b> first web in the experimental cage, although it was initially incomplete.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, saw Jenkins play in two Tests {{against the}} West Indies. In the first, he took nine wickets, but conceded almost 300 runs. Jenkins {{was probably the}} only English spinner who might have <b>spun</b> <b>the</b> ball appreciably on the cast-iron Australian wickets of previous years, a shift to a wetter climate meant he was not considered. His all-round work continued to be valuable for Worcestershire up to 1952, when he did the double for the second time, and played in two Tests against India with some success.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, though already forty-eight - an age {{at which}} most cricketers even in that era had already retired - Charlie Parker equalled Jack Hearne's record of taking 100 wickets by 12 June and his total {{aggregate}} was the second highest of his career. However, age {{finally caught up with}} Parker in 1932 after a promising beginning. Though he still <b>spun</b> <b>the</b> ball considerably, he lost his accuracy of length and consequently was expensive. Because Gloucestershire had no support for him and Goddard, Parker continued to play until 1935, but never recovered his former powers.|$|E

25|$|In the US, {{a system}} {{originally}} {{developed in the}} French ITT laboratories was widely used. The ITT team had fled France {{in front of the}} German invasion and destroyed their equipment before leaving. They were able to quickly duplicate their efforts once reaching the US. This system used a motor to quickly spin a radiogoniometer, as well as providing an input to electronics that <b>spun</b> <b>the</b> X and Y inputs of a cathode ray tube (CRT). This caused the signal to trace out a pattern on the display {{that could be used to}} determine the direction of the transmission almost instantly.|$|E
25|$|During power operation, {{heavy water}} was {{circulated}} by primary pumps through the U-tubes containing the fuel assemblies which heated the water. The heated water then flowed through an inverted U-tube steam generator where {{the heat was}} transferred to the secondary side light water which turned to steam. The steam flowed to an oil-fired superheater which increased the steam quality before the steam entered the turbine which <b>spun</b> <b>the</b> electrical generator. After passing through the steam generator, the primary loop water was pumped back to the reactor by the primary pumps to repeat the cycle. The primary loop heavy water was pressurized to ensure that the heavy water remained liquid and did not flash to steam at any point in the loop.|$|E
25|$|It {{is highly}} {{probable}} that the Proto-Indo-Europeans believed in three fate goddesses who <b>spun</b> <b>the</b> destinies of mankind. Although such fate goddesses {{are not directly}} attested in the Indo-Aryan tradition, the Atharvaveda does contain an allusion comparing fate to a warp. Furthermore, the three Fates appear in nearly every other Indo-European mythology. Examples include the Hittite Gulses, the Greek Moirai, the Roman Parcae, the Norse Norns, the Lithuanian Deivės Valdytojos, the Latvian Láimas, the Serbian Sudjenice, and the Albanian Fatit. They appear in English mythology as the Wyrdes, who were later adapted to become the Three Witches in Shakespeare's Macbeth. An Old Irish hymn attests to seven goddesses who were believed to weave the thread of destiny, which demonstrates that these spinster fate-goddesses were present in Celtic mythology as well.|$|E

25|$|The {{first race}} of the season was at Interlagos in Brazil, where Senna took pole position. He took an early lead, but Schumacher's Benetton was never far behind. Schumacher took the race lead for good after passing Senna in the pits. While trying for a win, he pushed too hard and <b>spun</b> <b>the</b> car coming out of Junção on lap 56, {{stalling}} it and retiring from the race. The second race was the inaugural Pacific Grand Prix at Aida, where Senna again placed {{the car on the}} pole. However, after being beaten to the first corner by second-qualifier Schumacher, he was hit from behind in the first corner by Mika Häkkinen and his race came to a definitive end when, while spinning backwards into the first corner's gravel trap, the Ferrari driven by Nicola Larini T-boned the Williams. Both drivers retired with front-suspension damage. Hill also retired with transmission problems, while Schumacher took the victory again.|$|E
25|$|As a batsman Jupp {{struck the}} happy medium between {{enterprise}} and caution. He watched the ball {{so well that}} when occasion demanded he could play a rigidly defensive game, while on a fast wicket there were few cricketers of his day better worth watching. He possessed {{a wide variety of}} strokes, and can drive or out with equal power and facility. His footwork, too, was so good that on a treacherous pitch he was a particularly valuable batsman. Before the First World War, and for a time afterwards he bowled medium pace rather on the quick side, but later took a shorter run, and became a slow to slow-medium bowler. Few bowlers of the 1920s <b>spun</b> <b>the</b> ball as much as he did and, with a wicket to help him, he could make it turn to a pronounced degree. One of the secrets of his success as a bowler was his cleverness in adapting himself to the changing conditions of a pitch. He was also rated as a brilliant fieldsman at cover point.|$|E
25|$|The third (and final) {{practice}} session was delayed three times for 45 minutes {{from its original}} start time because foggy weather conditions prevented the medical helicopter from flying and was initially held on a damp track, although some light rain fell towards the session's end. Cars were equipped with intermediate tyres to start the session before switching to dry slick tyres when the track dried up. Webber set the fastest timed lap at one minute and 41.002 seconds with twenty minutes of practice remaining, and was nearly three-tenths of a second faster than Anthony Davidson in Toyota's No. 5 car. Duval <b>spun</b> <b>the</b> No. 8 Audi at the second turn late in the session. Rast was the fastest LMP2 driver with a lap of one minute and 50.260 seconds in the session's final minute, nearly seven-tenths of a second quicker than Graves in Manor's No. 44 car. Gianmaria Bruni recorded the quickest time in LMGTE Pro, driving the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari, while David Heinemeier Hansson in the No. 88 Abu Dhabi-Proton Racing vehicle was the fastest driver in LMGTE Am, despite spinning his car in the session's closing minutes.|$|E
