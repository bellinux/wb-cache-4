40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> in silvopastoral system in the Loess Plateau of west Shanxi Province. <b>Soil</b> <b>moisture</b> in 0 - 100 cm layer was measured and analyzed in locustnatural grass system. The results showed as following: (1) There were significant differences of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> in 0 - 100 cm layer in different phenological phases. <b>Soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> in different patch types were different in silvopastoral system. The <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> of the grassland were significantly greater than the forestland's. (2) There were obvious hierarchy characteristics in soil profile in locust-natural grass system. The <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> and coefficient of variation both decreased with increase of soil depth. In horizontal direction, variations of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> were relatively obvious in grassland, and <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> increased with the increase of the distance from forest edge to grassland.

Previous surveys have identified fields with low organic matter contents and shallow compacted zones in the cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production region of central Alabama, USA. We initiated a field experiment in 2003 on a Lucedale fine sandy loam (fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Arenic Paleudult) to determine how conservation tillage systems and winter cover crops affect yields and moisture availability. Treatments were a factorial combination of tillage systems (no tillage, fall paratill, spring paratill, and spring strip tillage) and winter cover crops [no cover, rye (Secale cereale L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) ] in a randomized complete block design with four replications. <b>Soil</b> <b>moisture</b> was monitored continuously {{during the growing season}} to a depth of 30 cm. In 2004, results indicate that tillage had no effect on lint yields, while rye and wheat increased lint yields 12 and 5 % compared to no cover. <b>Soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> were generally 5 % higher than <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> measured from no cover plots. In 2005, some form of non-inversion tillage was superior to no-tillage. Lint yields across cover crops averaged 1512 kg ha- 1 for wheat, 1444 kg ha- 1 for rye, and 1299 kg ha- 1 for no cover. Trends in <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> across tillage systems and covers were similar to 2004, but not as dramatic.

Using a Delay Mapping Receiver (DMR), a set of reflected signals were collected over Las Cruces, New Mexico, an area known to have low <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> throughout the year. This area is also characterized by small vegetation density. The amplitude of the reflected signals were analyzed and compared to the direct signals to determine <b>soil</b> <b>moisture.</b> In addition, the collected data is referenced to physical bodies (i. e. rivers, lakes, dry land) to show a correlation of the amplitude of the reflections to water content. Although the accuracy of this method is still to be determined, the data studied was found to vary proportionally to <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents.</b> In addition, a method that incorporates terrain irregularities is briefly discussed {{as a means to}} reduce possible error sources.

40|$|Robust {{models for}} {{predicting}} soil salinity that use visible and near-infrared (vis-NIR) reflectance spectroscopy {{are needed to}} better quantify soil salinity in agricultural fields. Currently available models are not sufficiently robust for variable <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents.</b> Thus, we used external parameter orthogonalization (EPO), which effectively projects spectra onto the subspace orthogonal to unwanted variation, to remove the variations caused by an external factor, e. g., the influences of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> on spectral reflectance. In this study, 570 spectra between 380 and 2400 nm were obtained from soils with various <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> and salt concentrations in the laboratory; 3 soil types × 10 salt concentrations × 19 <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> levels were used. To examine the effectiveness of EPO, we compared the partial least squares regression (PLSR) results established from spectra with and without EPO correction. The EPO method effectively removed the effects of moisture, and the accuracy and robustness of the soil salt contents (SSCs) prediction model, which was built using the EPO-corrected spectra under various <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> conditions, were significantly improved relative to the spectra without EPO correction. This study contributes to the removal of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> effects from <b>soil</b> salinity estimations when using vis-NIR reflectance spectroscopy and can assist others in quantifying soil salinity in the future...|$|R

Two aspects of survival of P. cinnamomi on upland sites in the northern jarrah forest were examined, firstly, the survival of chlamydospores in surface soils, and secondly, the survival of P. cinnamomi in a common susceptible understorey species, Banksia grandis Willd. Chlamydospores of P. cinnamomi were recovered from a lowland water gaining site, but not from an adjacent upland freely draining site at Deer Road, although there was dying vegetation on both sites. <b>Soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> were significantly higher on the lowland site than on the upland site (P< 0. 001), and remained high over summer in the former but not in the latter.

40|$|Abstract: Soils and the {{underlying}} permafrost from undisturbed sites and sites that had been disturbed by construction activities at Marble Point and Pram Point in the McMurdo Sound regionwere sampled from excavated pits and drill cores. Gravimetric <b>moisture</b> (ice) <b>contents</b> and particle size distribution were determined. Volumetric <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> were calculated from these results. At undisturbed sites <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> within the active layer (to c. 60 rm depth) were low and ranged from 0. 5 % by weight at the soil surface to 10 % above the permafrost. The permafrost was generally completely saturated with ice, but sometimes contained considerable excess ice, with ice contents rising as high as 80 % by volume. At disturbed sites, <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> within the active layer {{were similar to those}} of the undisturbed sites (generally ~ 1 0 % by weight) but within the permafrost, <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> were lower and less variable than in the undisturbed sites, rarely exceeding 20 % by weight. The release of considerable quantities of water from the permafrost as a result of land disturbance during construction activities caused stream flows, soil shrinkage, land slumping and salinisation, resulting in significant permanent environmental damage. At Marble Point there has been no significant re-establishment of icy permafrost in the disturbed soils in the 30 years since land disturbance occurred...|$|R
40|$|Reflectance {{variation}} of bare <b>soil</b> with different <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> {{was described by}} a one-dimensional model of soil-water mixture employing the two-stream approximation of the radiative transfer equation. The concept of bulk absorption and scattering coefficients of electromagnetic radiation in the surface layers of moist soil was introduced for derivation of the Kubelka-Munk equations, which had been applied to various reflectance problems. The diffuse reflectivity of moist soil in visible and near-infrared bands could be explicitly {{expressed in terms of}} a moisture variable as well as optical characteristics parameters, or vice versa. A method was developed to determine these characteristic parameters from a set of <b>soil</b> reflectivity and <b>moisture</b> data. Hence, surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> could be measured by observing the soil spectral reflectivity.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} effect of <b>soil</b> type, <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> {{and the presence of}} frost on road substructure permittivity. Permittivity sensitivity of typical road soils was characterized in the laboratory to provide baseline dielectric constant values which were compared to field ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey results. Both laboratory devices, the complex dielectric network analyzer and the Adek Percometer, as well as the field GPR system were used in this study to measure the dielectric constant of soils. All three systems differentiated between coarse-grained and fine grained soils. In addition, at temperatures below freezing, all three systems identified an increase in water content in soils; however, when frozen, the sensitivity of dielectric constant across <b>soil</b> type and <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> was significantly reduced. Based on the findings of this study, GPR technology has the ability to characterize in situ substructure <b>soil</b> type and <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> of typical Saskatchewan road substructure soils.
