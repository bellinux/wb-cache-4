The meristogram provides a graphical representation of <b>serial</b> <b>variation</b> in hook morphology along the acanthocephalan proboscis. The method is also applicable to other animals possessing serially repeating structures. The meristogram algorithm is implemented in R. A simple to use {{graphical user interface}} (GUI) has been implemented using Shiny. However, {{there is also a}} command line interface (CLI) for users with some experience of R.

40|$|Vertebral laminae are bony ridges or sheets {{that connect}} {{important}} morphological landmarks on the vertebrae, like diapophyses or zygapophyses. They usually exhibit some <b>serial</b> <b>variation</b> throughout the column. A consistent terminology facilitates the morphological description of this variation, and {{the recognition of}} patterns that could be taxonomically significant and could serve as phylogenetic characters. Such a terminology was designed for saurischian dinosaurs, and has also been applied to other members of Archosauriformes. Herein, this terminology is applied {{for the first time}} to lizards (Squamata). Probably due to their generally smaller size compared to saurischian dinosaurs, lizards have less developed vertebral laminae. Some laminae could not be recognized in this group and others require new names to account for differences in basic vertebral morphology. For instance, the fusion of diapophysis and parapophysis in lacertids into a structure called synapophysis necessitates the creation of the new term synapophyseal laminae for both diapophyseal and parapophyseal laminae. An assessment of occurrence and <b>serial</b> <b>variation</b> in a number of lacertid species shows that some laminae develop throughout ontogeny or only occur in large-sized species, whereas the distribution of other laminae might prove to be taxonomically significant in future...|$|E

The Kalmia species are stenopalynous and characterized by 3 -colpor(oid) ate, medium, oblate pollen united in tetrahedral tetrads with rugulate exine sculpture. However, a continuous and <b>serial</b> <b>variation</b> in all the quantitative characters and exine sculpture was revealed within the genus. Kalmia buxifolia is characterized by having the smallest pollen tetrads, largest aperture, largest 2 f/D ratio and septum thicker than apocolpial exine. On the other hand, K. latifolia produces the largest pollen tetrads with smallest aperture and smallest 2 f/D ratio. An evolutionary trend from rugulate to psilate has also been observed in apocolpial exine sculpture of the genus Kalmia. On the basis of acetolysed pollen characteristics, a dichotomous key for Kalmia was prepared...|$|E

The current study attempts to evaluate the mul-tifactor approach by examining whether cultural and structural variables might con-tribute to explaining the considerable interstate differences {{in the incidence of}} male serial killer activity. Separate analyses were conducted for two different state-level male serial killer rates, one based on the state where male serial killers received their early socialization and the other based on the state where male serial killers murdered their largest number of victims. Consistent with the multifactor approach, the results indicated that aspects of culture and social structure were able to account for much of the male <b>serial</b> killer <b>variation</b> among states...|$|R
40|$|In music, {{the term}} "variation" {{describes}} both a technique and a form. The technique of variation, the alteration {{of a musical}} idea, pervades every form, style and period of music from Gregorian chant to Serialism. Variation is fundamental. When this fundamental technique becomes the overriding principle that lends structure to a musical composition, variation is elevated from technique to form. If variation technique is the process, then variation form is the result. Accordingly, variation form derives from continuous and systematic variation technique. Variation form is governed {{by the idea of}} retention and alteration. With each variation, a composer chooses to retain some elements of the theme while altering others. In doing so, he realizes that each variation promises new combinations of constants and changes. The balancing of innovation and continuity and its limitless possibilities account for the form's universal appeal. This dissertation explores the numerous methods that composers have adopted to mold the Variation form according to their own musical style and historical reference. The repertoire discussed and recorded focuses on independent strophic variation sets written for the keyboard. A survey of this repertoire produces the following categorizations: Harmonic Variations (basso ostinato and constant-harmony), Melodic Variations (constant-melody and melodic-outline), Character Variations (formal-outline and fantasy/free), <b>Serial</b> <b>Variations,</b> and Hybrid Variations. Certain variation types, namely constant-melody, serial, and fantasy/free, are synonymous with a particular time and repertoire because they wholly identifY with the aesthetics of a given historical period or style. Constant-harmony, melodic-outline, formal-outline and hybrid types are more pliable and thus produce a more diverse repertoire from multiple historical periods. The remaining form, basso ostinato, engenders a keyboard variation repertoire that spans six centuries; it is truly a universal form. While these conclusions are legitimate, they do not accurately convey the diversity of the variation repertoire. In the end, composers of all periods make individual choices in selecting which form or combination of forms best expresses their creative impulse...|$|R

Judd’s infrageneric classification of Pieris was reexamined {{in the light of}} new palynological characters. The genus Pieris is stenopalynous in having 3 -colporate and oblate pollen tetrads. However, a continuous and <b>serial</b> <b>variation</b> in the exine sculpture, tetrad diameter, polar and equatorial length of pollen and apocolpial exine thickness was revealed within the genus. Pieris nana is characterized by having the smallest pollen and the smallest rugulae in the rugulate sculpture. Considering other distinct morphological characters, we confirm the recognition of monotypic subgenus Arcterica based on this species. Within the other subgenus, Pieris, members of the sections Pieris and Phillyreoides can be distinguished by subtle differences in colpus width, septum thickness and ratio of colpus length to tetrad diameter. Pieris formosa is distinguished by its psilate exine with clear secondary striate sculpture. Pieris japonica and P. cubensis are not well differentiated in the palynological characters, and act as a bridge between sect. Pieris and sect. Phillyreoides. On the basis of palynological characters a dichotomous key of these taxa was also prepared...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{claims that}} {{phonology}} should express {{the relationship between}} vowel length and obstruent voicing operationally rather than in parallel. The empirical focus in on Friulian and Milanese. The distribution of vowel length in Friulian is predictable from the underlying laryngeal specification of obstruents. Stressed vowels are long before underlyingly voiced word-final obstruents although they devoice. This situation creates opacity. In {{the light of the}} interaction between vowel lengthening and final devoicing, this paper argues in favor of Harmonic Serialism, a version of Optimality Theory that combines constraint ranking with serial derivations. I demonstrate that only in Harmonic Serialism does vowel length naturally follow from the independent need to satisfy NoVoicedCoda and FootBinarityµ, instead of assuming that vowel lengthening is the consequence of whether or not obstruents project a mora depending on their laryngeal specification. The facts of Milanese are also considered. Milanese patterns as Friulian except that final devoicing is not categorical. I use <b>Serial</b> <b>Variation</b> (Kimper 2011) {{to solve the problem of}} opacity and variation in the realization or not of final devoicing. An alternative approach to Milanese that assumes gradual devoicing is also suggested. This analysis combines Harmonic Serialism and turbid output representations (Goldrick 2001, van Oostendorp 2008), and allows us to express formally the difference between Friulian and Milanese in terms of categorical versus gradual devoicing...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development and}} application of a management procedure (decision rule) {{that resulted in a}} voluntary reduction in the commercial catch of spiny rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) in the lower east coast of North Island of New Zealand. The management procedure was developed from an accepted assessment of the CRA 4 (Wellington-Hawke's Bay) fishery, which used an integrated length-based assessment model fitted to commercial fishery catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) biomass indices, commercial length-frequency data, and tag-recapture data. The assessment model had been Bayesian, and used the joint posterior distribution of parameters to predict the effect of 384 alternative harvest control rules on the future size of the CRA 4 stock. The harvest control rules all used CPUE as their input, and generated annual changes in catch, which were then simulated by the population dynamics of the operating model. Uncertainty was added to evaluations through observation error, added to the simulated CPUE observations, and stochastic <b>serial</b> auto-correlation <b>variation</b> in recruitment. We describe how this management procedure was used to effect a voluntary reduction in catch {{to address the problem of}} a rapidly declining population. ...|$|R
40|$|Ecosystems are {{fragmented}} {{by natural}} and anthropogenic processes that affect organism movement and ecosystem dynamics. When a fragmentation restricts predator but not prey movement, then the prey produced {{on one side}} of an ecosystem edge can subsidize predators on the other side. When prey flux is high, predator density on the receiving side increases above that possible by in situ prey productivity, and when low, the formerly subsidized predators can impose strong top-down control of in situ prey-in situ prey experience apparent competition from the subsidy. If predators feed on some evolutionary clades of in situ prey over others, then subsidy-derived apparent competition will induce phylogenetic structure in prey composition. Dams fragment the serial nature of river ecosystems by prohibiting movement of organisms and restricting flowing water. In the river tailwater just below a large central Mexican dam, fish density was high and fish gorged on reservoir-derived zooplankton. When the dam was closed, water flow and the zooplankton subsidy ceased, densely packed pools of fish formed, fish switched to feed on in situ prey, and the tailwater macroinvertebrate community was phylogenetic structured. We derived expectations of structure from trait-based community assembly models based on macroinvertebrate body size, tolerance to anthropogenic disturbance, and fish-diet selectivity. The diet-selectivity model best fit the observed tailwater phylogenetic structure. Thus, apparent competition from subsidies phylogenetically structures prey communities, and <b>serial</b> <b>variation</b> in phylogenetic community structure can be indicative of fragmentation in formerly continuous ecosystems. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: The {{vertebral}} {{system in}} Hippocampus hippocampus is highly specialised {{because of the}} vertical locomotion and tail prehensility. The vertebral elements represent a special case of morphological changes, being the metameric structures organised along a natural functional series. We investigated the shape changes along the vertebral spine in H. hippocampus through geometric morphometrics, in order to describe functional and structural patterns. Actually, the dorso-ventral tail bending ability in the genus Hippocampus {{is one of the}} most impressive morphological modifications in the evolutionary history of fishes. Vertebrae were analysed using a 2 D configuration from the left lateral view. The variation along the vertebral series suggests the identification of cervical, abdominal, dorsal, and caudal groups. The first three (cervical) elements and the 10 th (supra-dorsal) structure show peculiar morphologies and local adaptations, associated with neck angulation and dorsal fin muscles, respectively. The vertebral size decreases from the anteriormost element backward, with some local variation at the dorsal area. Major changes are related to allometric variation at the neural region. The caudal elements are characterised by a marked size decrease, with consequent allometric shape changes involving the rotation of the posterior vertebral opening. This allometric trajectory leads to a natural ventral bending of the tail, promoting its prehensile function. This morphological survey suggests an interesting structural network between posture, locomotion, and vertebral anatomy, underlying the main functional changes in the Hippocampus biomechanics. Geometric morphometrics is rather suitable to approach metameric studies in terms of <b>serial</b> <b>variation</b> and functional adaptations...|$|E
40|$|Many titanosaurian dinosaurs {{are known}} only from fragmentary remains, making {{comparisons}} between taxa difficult {{because they often}} lack overlapping skeletal elements. This problem is particularly pronounced for the exceptionally large-bodied members of this sauropod clade. Dreadnoughtus schrani is a well-preserved giant titanosaurian from the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian–Maastrichtian) Cerro Fortaleza Formation of southern Patagonia, Argentina. Numerous skeletal elements are known for Dreadnoughtus, including seven nearly complete dorsal vertebrae and a partial dorsal neural arch that collectively represent most of the dorsal sequence. Here we build on our previous preliminary description of these skeletal elements by providing a detailed assessment of their serial positional assignments, as well as comparisons of the dorsal vertebrae of Dreadnoughtus {{with those of other}} exceptionally large-bodied titanosaurians. Although the dorsal elements of Dreadnoughtus probably belong to two individuals, they exhibit substantial morphological variation that suggests that there is minimal, if any, positional overlap among them. Dreadnoughtus therefore preserves the second-most complete dorsal vertebral series known for a giant titanosaurian that has been described in detail, behind only that of Futalognkosaurus. The dorsal sequence of Dreadnoughtus provides valuable insight into <b>serial</b> <b>variation</b> along the vertebral column of these enormous sauropods. Such variation includes the variable presence of divided spinodiapophyseal laminae and associated spinodiapophyseal fossae. Given that dorsal vertebrae are the only elements that overlap between known remains of most giant titanosaurian taxa, the dorsal series of Dreadnoughtus provides a means to directly compare the morphologies of these sauropods. The dorsal vertebrae of Dreadnoughtus and Futalognkosaurus have dorsoventrally narrow transverse processes, unlike the condition in Puertasaurus. Further, Dreadnoughtus and Argentinosaurus have ventromedially inclined prezygapophyses, whereas Futalognkosaurus has almost horizontal prezygapophyses. The continued inclusion of new, well-represented skeletons of titanosaurians such as Dreadnoughtus in phylogenetic and functional morphological studies will aid in deciphering the interrelationships and paleobiology of Titanosauria...|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the order effect in item-recognition response time, that is, differences in response time for multiple-item probes containing {{items in the}} same or in the reverse order {{as those in the}} memory set. Experiment 1 used the response condition in which only one item must be positive for a positive response, Experiment 2 used homogeneous probes in which all the items are either positive or negative, and Experiment 3 used the condition in which all the items must be positive. Of particular interest were the <b>serial</b> position <b>variations</b> in order effects for probes containing items that were adjacent in the memory set. We previously found that such effects are an indication of subjective grouping of the memory set and the matching of the probe with these subgroups. The order effect in the one-positive condition was only weak in most cases, but it was strong with homogeneous probes when the memory set was objectively grouped or was ungrouped but with a constant set size. There were also strong order effects in the all-positive condition for probes with items that were nonadjacent in the memory set. Our results are interpreted in terms of a parallel match process based on a distribution over position of items in subjective or objective groups. We account for the origin of the distribution-over-position process in terms of multiple representations of the grouped memory sets. The model assumes that each subgroup is represented in memory several, and perhaps very many, times and that considerable error in item positioning can occur over the multiple representations of any group...|$|R
40|$|The hooks of the acanthocephalan {{proboscis}} exhibit <b>serial</b> <b>variation</b> in {{size and}} shape. The Meristogram was developed by Huffman and Bullock (1975) to provide a graphical representation of this positional variation in hook morphology. Initial studies demonstrated {{the ability of the}} Meristogram to discriminate species within the genera Echinorhynchus and Pomphorhynchus (Huffman and Bullock 1975, Huffman and Nickol 1978, Gleason and Huffman 1981). However, the reliability of the method for taxonomic work was questioned by Shostak et al. (1986) after they found intra-specific variation in two Echinorhynchus species. Uncertainty about the usefulness of the Meristogram and the absence of a readily available software implementation of the algorithm, might explain why this abstract proboscis character has yet to be adopted by acanthocephalan systematists. The Meristogram algorithm was implemented in the R language and a simple graphical user interface created to facilitate ease of use (the software is freely available from [URL] The accuracy of the algorithm's formula for calculating hook cross-sectional area was validated by data collected using a digitizing tablet. Meristograms were created from data in public respositories for eight Echinorhynchus taxa: E. bothniensis, E. 'bothniensis', E. gadi spp. A, B and I, E. brayi, E. salmonis and E. truttae. In this preliminary analysis, the meristogram differentiated E. bothniensis, E. brayi, E. gadi sp. B, E. salmonis and E. truttae from each other, and from the remaining taxa in this study, but independent data will be required for validation. Sample sizes for E. 'bothniensis' and E. gadi spp. A and I were too small to identify diagnostic features with any degree of confidence. Meristogram differences among the sibling species of the E. gadi and E. bothniensis groups suggest that the 'intra-specfic' variation in meristogram previously reported for some Echinorhynchus taxa, may have actually represented morphological divergence between unrecognized cryptic species. Hierarchical clustering of taxa based on Meristogram data yielded dendrograms that were largely concordant with phylogenetic relationships inferred from DNA sequence data, indicating the presence of a strong phylogenetic signal...|$|E

In three recorded recitals at the University of Maryland School of Music, this dissertation project explores a diverse range of expressive possibilities for violin in seven types of variation form in Austro-German works for violin from the 17 th through the 20 th centuries. The first program, consisting of Baroque Period works, performed on period instrument, includes the divisions on “John come kiss me now” from The Division Violin by Thomas Baltzar (1631 – 1663), constant bass variations in Sonate Unarum Fidium by Johann Heinrich von Schmelzer (1623 – 1680), arbitrary variation in Sonata for Violin and Continuo in E Major, Op. 1, No. 12 “Roger” by George Friedrich Händel (1685 – 1759), and French Double style, melodic-outline variation in Partita for Unaccompanied Violin in B Minor by Johan Sebastian Bach (1685 – 1750). Theme and Variations, a popular Classical Period format, is represented by the Sonata for Piano and Violin in G Major K. 379 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756 – 1791) and Sonata for Violin and Piano in A Major, Op. 47 No. 9 the “Kreutzer” by Ludwig van Beethoven (1770 – 1827). Fantasy for Piano and Violin in C Major D. 934 by Franz Schubert (1797 – 1828) represents the 19 th century fantasia variation.

40|$|Past {{research}} {{has suggested that}} the disruptive effect of altered auditory feedback depends on how structurally similar the sequence of feedback events is to the planned sequence of actions. Three experiments pursued one basis for similarity in musical keyboard performance: matches between sequential transitions in spatial targets for movements and the melodic contour of auditory feedback. Trained pianists and musically untrained persons produced simple tonal melodies on a keyboard while hearing feedback sequences that either matched the planned melody or were contour-preserving varia-tions of that melody. Sequence production was disrupted among pianists when feedback events were serially shifted by one event, similarly for shifts of planned melodies and tonal variations but less so for shifts of atonal variations. Nonpianists {{were less likely to be}} disrupted by <b>serial</b> shifts of <b>variations</b> but showed similar disruption to pianists for shifts of the planned melody.

40|$|SUMMARY. A {{widening}} of the oonoept of stationarity {{leads to the}} concepts of smooth hetero-morphy and local homomorphy in stochastic series, obviating much {{of the need for}} the introduction of trend into structural specifications of statistical data. It is shown that formulae for sampling properties of local statistics in stationary stochastic series are applicable as they stand to series having these less restricted properties. 1. INTBODUCTION In a recent paper (1955 a) the author established the principle that the sampling properties, and notably the standard errors, of statistics constructed from local comparisons of terms in stationary normal stochastic series were approximately deducible from the short term variational properties of the series themselves. In making practical use of such statistics, {{it is not necessary to}} know the mean, variance, or serial correlations of the series, all of which are dependent on the long-term variational properties of the series; it suffices to know the values of the <b>serial</b> and lag <b>variation</b> functions for short lags, i. e. the mean semi-squared differences of terms in the series separated by distances which are short. This principle is important because in many practical applications the stretches of series which constitute the data are muoh too short to provide accurate and unbiased estimates of long-term variational properties, whereas accurate and unbiased estimates of the lag varia-tion functions for short lags can be obtained even, say, by combining evidence from short scraps of series having the same variational properties but different means. In recent papers the author has proposed the application of this principle in a number of techniques, including the following...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{observed}} systematic differences in costs for teaching hospitals (THhenceforth) in Spain. Concern has been voiced regarding {{the existence of}} a bias in the financing of TH’s has been raised once prospective budgets are in the arena for hospital finance, and claims for adjusting {{to take into account the}} ‘legitimate’ extra costs of teaching on hospital expenditure are well grounded. We focus on the estimation of the impact of teaching status on average cost. We used a version of a multiproduct hospital cost function taking into account some relevant factors from which to derive the observed differences. We assume that the relationship between the explanatory and the dependent variables follows a flexible form for each of the explanatory variables. We also model the underlying covariance structure of the data. We assumed two qualitatively different sources of variation: random effects and <b>serial</b> correlation. Random <b>variation</b> refers to both general level variation (through the random intercept) and the variation specifically related to teaching status. We postulate that the impact of the random effects is predominant over the impact of the serial correlation effects. The model is estimated by restricted maximum likelihood. Our results show that costs are 9 % higher (15 % in the case of median costs) in teaching than in non-teaching hospitals. That is, teaching status legitimately explains no more than half of the observed difference in actual costs. The impact on costs of the teaching factor depends on the number of residents, with an increase of 51. 11 % per resident for hospitals with fewer than 204 residents (third quartile of the number of residents) and 41. 84 % for hospitals with more than 204 residents. In addition, the estimated dispersion is higher among teaching hospitals. As a result, due to the considerable observed heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution. From a policy making point of view, we conclude that since a higher relative burden for medical training is under public hospital command, an explicit adjustment to the extra costs that the teaching factor imposes on hospital finance is needed, before hospital competition for inpatient services takes place.
