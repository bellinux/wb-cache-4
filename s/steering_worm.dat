40|$|Abstract. The {{manufacturing}} process sequence {{of a power}} <b>steering</b> <b>worm</b> gear blank is analyzed. The conventional process sequence for manufacturing power assisted steering (PAS) part contains three distinctive operational stages such as indentation, extrusion, and upsetting, which were originally designed by forming equipment experts. Process conditions such as reduction in area, semi die angle and upsetting ratio are carefully considered to prevent from internal or geometrical defects. The simulation results of the conventional forging process are summarized in terms of deformation patterns, load-stroke relationships and die pressures along the interface for each operational stage. Close investigation of simulation results for current forming process leads to a new process sequence in which the number of operation are reduced into just one operation. Comparisons between the existing and proposed processes are made in terms of maximum force requirement, required forming energy, and process time, respectively. Experiment has been performed {{to confirm that the}} proposed process could be applied to replace the existing conventional process sequence and proved the new process to be a safe process sequence for manufacturing PAS part...|$|E

50|$|<b>Steering</b> was <b>worm</b> and sector with Hardy disc.Brakes used a two-circuit {{hydraulic}} system (two fluid distributors and two master cylinders, {{one for the}} front {{and one for the}} rear), Lockheed-type duplex brakes 17 x 2 in drums all round. An equaliser was fitted, which could avoid overbraking by changing the distribution of braking force between the front and rear brakes during driving.5.50-18 racing crossply tyres were mounted on Alfa Romeo 18-inch Rudge-type wire wheels.|$|R
50|$|<b>Steering</b> is by <b>worm</b> and wheel, {{the drop}} shaft {{attached}} to the wheel is on three keyways {{so it can be}} turned through 120 deg. to compensate for wear. Also adjustment is provided for engagement of the worm to the wheel.|$|R
5000|$|Per Lord's intention, the A40 Sports {{was based}} on the {{mechanicals}} of the Austin A40 Devon, though the centre section of the chassis was boxed to provide rigidity for the open body. The A40 Sports also employed a twin-SU carburetored version of the 1.2 L engine producing [...] rather than [...] Gear selection was originally via a floor-mounted shifter. <b>Steering</b> was <b>worm</b> and roller type, front suspension was independent coil springs with rigid beam axle and semi-elliptic leaf springs at the rear.|$|R
50|$|The four-wheel brakes are {{operated}} hydraulically. They {{are designed}} on the Lockheed system. There {{is also a}} hand lever fitted with a sensibly shaped trigger to control the back brakes. The springs front and back are half-elliptical with oilite bearings and double-action hydraulic shock absorbers. The rear suspension like the frame passes below the axle. <b>Steering</b> is by <b>worm</b> and nut in a box held by a bracket to the frame.|$|R

50|$|In August 1933 a newly {{designed}} chassis was introduced for the Twelve-Six and Twelve-Four cars. It had a dropped and cross-braced frame {{under the new}} bodies. At {{the same time a}} new design for front and rear axles entered production fitted with new brakes and a new revised linkage to the driver's brake pedal. The back axle was modified and now has combined load and thrust journals to reduce weight. <b>Steering</b> gear, previously <b>worm</b> and wheel, was changed in August 1935 to an hour-glass worm and sector.|$|R
2500|$|The {{change in}} the body style from the Mark B was both {{functional}} and aesthetic. The Mark C utilised the same 180Â° <b>steering</b> lock and <b>worm</b> and sector <b>steering</b> system that {{was seen in the}} prototype Commercial and the front wings allowed for ample clearance at full lock. They also addressed a demand from customers for a [...] "greater smoothness of line", and allowed a more robust location for the mounting of the front lights. Other improvements included rod and cable operated brakes on all three wheels, which [...] "appreciably shortens stopping distances." ...|$|R
50|$|There are six brakes {{all worked}} by cable. The four-wheel brakes {{share a common}} cable at each side and some {{compensation}} is provided between front and back brakes on each side. Drums are enclosed and ribbed. There is a hand-operated primary adjuster under the bonnet for the brakes on each wheel and by spanner {{at the end of}} the cable at each brake. The forward brakes operate on the Rubury principle. <b>Steering</b> is by <b>worm</b> and wheel. Suspension is by half elliptic springs fitted with shock absorbers. Gaiters are fitted back and front. Back springs are underhung, forward springs are flat set and splayed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hand lever}} to the driver's {{right by the}} change-speed lever {{operates}} internal expanding brakes on the back wheels, the foot brake pedal operates a contracting band on a drum just behind the gearbox. A hand adjustment for wear is provided for both rear and transmission brakes. The Times thought the suspension was not quite free from fore and aft movement but was otherwise satisfactory and comfortable on a rough road. The springs are set {{with a minimum of}} camber, they are half-elliptical, set on top of the axles and from 1923 Hartford shock absorbers were fitted at the back.

50|$|The hull is wooden and V-shaped, with a {{hard chine}} and a square stern. In order to provide a stable {{platform}} when dredging, skipjacks have very low freeboard and a wide beam (averaging one third the length on deck). A centerboard is mounted {{in lieu of a}} keel. The mast is hewn from a single log, with two stays on either side, without spreaders; it is stepped towards the bow of the boat, with a small cabin. As typical in regional practice the bow features a curving longhead under the bowsprit, with carved and painted trailboards. A small figurehead is common. A typical skipjack is 40 to 50 feet in length. The boats use direct link Edson <b>worm</b> <b>steering</b> gear mounted immediately forward of the transom.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} the car was {{conservative}} with a pressed steel body built on a ladder chassis. The chassis was designed to give a low overall height to the car by dipping down by 2.75 inches (70 mm) between the axles. The 1125-cc four-cylinder side-valve engine producing [...] drove the rear wheels through a four-speed gearbox and open drive shaft to a live rear axle. <b>Steering</b> was by <b>worm</b> and wheel. Suspension was by half-elliptic springs all round mounted on silent-bloc bushes and damped by frictional shock absorbers. The four-wheel brakes were cable and rod operated by pedal or by hand lever on the offside of the speed lever. The electrical system was 6 volt. For the first year only, a four-door saloon was made in two versions. The basic model cost Â£155 and was capable of reaching 55 mph with an economy of 34 and the Sunshine or De-Luxe with opening roof and leather upholstery at Â£168. Bumpers were provided. The chassis was priced at Â£120.|$|R
2500|$|At the {{motorcycle}} show in November 1951, Sharp's announced what they described as [...] "a revolutionary {{design in the}} field of commercial vehicles". [...] The Sharp's Commercial 3 Cwt took the concept of the Minicar's light, three-wheeled, utilitarian design, and adapted it as the basis for an open-top lightweight industrial vehicle. The yellow and black prototype at the show was powered by an Indian Brave [...] four-stroke side valve engine (supplied by Brockhouse Engineering Co., Southport) and mounted in a cradle ahead and above the front wheel. Though described as [...] "constructed on the stressed-skin principle", large cut outs to allow easy access from either side of the vehicle required much additional strengthening to the floor, with a central steel backbone girder, a cross member between the rear wheels and further triangular bracing. The single seat was located centrally as was the steering wheel. <b>Steering</b> was by <b>worm</b> and sector, and flared side panels allowed the single front wheel to turn a full 180Â°, making the vehicle extremely manoeuvrable. The entire engine, drive-train and steering unit could be removed by undoing four bolts to allow for easy servicing. Unlike the Minicar, there were brakes on all three wheels and there was a wooden-slatted floor behind the driver. Though the Sharp's Commercial never entered production, it served as a forerunner to van and pickup versions of the Mark B which appeared in 1952.|$|R

As your left foot just naturally finds the clutch pedal and you put the tractor into gear you begin to get the feeling that here is a tractor that is as easy 10 drive as the family car. And as you give it the gas (gasoline. distillate or kerosene). and let in the clutch, you get the thrill which comes with the realization that here, under finger. tip control, is ready, eager power to romp through all your farm power jobs with salisÂ· factoty thoroughness, speed and economy.

5000|$|Many {{changes were}} made for 1965. Though the 1.5 L SP310 {{continued}} in production through January, a new 1.6 L R16-powered SP311 and SPL311 joined it. The new model was first shown at the 1964 Tokyo Motor Show, but did not enter production until March 1965. The restyling was executed in part by Count Albrecht Goertz, who would later be involved with designing the first Fairlady Z. Marketed as the Fairlady 1600, or the Datsun Sports 1600 in many export markets including North America, it featured 14 inch wheels and minor exterior changes. The SPL311 was also known in the United States, on the West Coast, as the [...] "Roadster". The front suspension was independent, utilizing coil springs over hydraulic shocks. Rear suspension was a common leaf springs design, dampened with hydraulic shocks. The 1600 SPL311 came {{with a pair of}} SU carburators. The engine produced [...] The R16 is an in-line four cylinder OHV engine. Early SPL311 came with a high compression engine that had three main bearings, hydraulic lifters, a cast iron block and cast iron head. Timing of the distributor could be easily adjusted to reduce pre-ignition knock and thereby tune for questionable quality gasoline. Engines in later SPL311 had 5 main bearings and this addressed a design weakness. Top speed for the SPL311 with approximately 91 octane gasoline was approximately 105 mph. The axle gearing suffered from design limitations and Datsun performance parts offered a cooling system as a retofit. <b>Steering</b> utilized a <b>worm</b> gear design. The hood badge said [...] "Datsun" [...] in individual letters, the rear badge said [...] "Datsun 1600", and the side badges said [...] "Fairlady" [...] (Japanese market) or [...] "Datsun 1600" [...] (export market). The SP311 continued in production through April 1970.|$|R
