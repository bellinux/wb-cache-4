5|$|Seyfried {{has stated}} that she suffers from anxiety and panic attacks. She also suffers from <b>stage</b> <b>fright</b> and avoided {{performing}} in theater productions until April 2015. Seyfried has a taxidermy collection.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{scenario for}} the short involved a magician who incorporates an autograph seeking rabbit into his act after his previous rabbit leaves him. Complications arise as the new rabbit suffers from <b>stage</b> <b>fright.</b> Sweetland compared it to the plot of A Star Is Born. The idea was reworked due to being too long and complicated, taking an estimated three minutes longer to tell.|$|E
5|$|Tsamere {{comes out}} of character, thanks the audience, writers and {{producers}} of the show, and explains that the preceding story is a fiction. He talks about his <b>stage</b> <b>fright</b> and goes off on a tangent about the bulbs around mirrors in dressing rooms; he asks a row of the audience to stand repeatedly to check whether pillars in the theatre are load-bearing. He ends by saying {{that he does not}} need the mirror, as he does not wear make-up.|$|E
5|$|Albertson {{returned}} {{in a later}} episode that features Dr. Campanelli participating in a documentary film about hospital surgery. Unfortunately, Campanelli develops <b>stage</b> <b>fright</b> during filming. Noland then takes over the operation and receives all the acclaim. Kopell returned to {{his role as a}} hospital orderly in two episodes, one in which he causes a furor with a hospital scandal sheet, the other showing Noland having to save him from being fleeced by a patient who is also a card shark.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{idea for the}} short was a magician who incorporated a rabbit into his act who suffered from <b>stage</b> <b>fright.</b> This {{was considered to be}} too long and complicated, and the idea was reworked. To design the theater featured in Presto, the filmmakers visited several opera houses and theaters for set design ideas. Problems arose when trying to animate the theater's audience of 2,500 patrons; this was deemed too expensive, and was solved by showing the back of the audience.|$|E
5|$|From {{a family}} with no {{background}} of ballet or music, MacMillan was determined {{from an early age}} to become a dancer. The director of Sadler's Wells Ballet, Ninette de Valois, accepted him as a student and then a member of her company. In the late 1940s, MacMillan built a successful career as a dancer, but, plagued by <b>stage</b> <b>fright,</b> he abandoned it while still in his twenties. After this he worked entirely as a choreographer; he created ten full-length ballets and more than fifty one-act pieces. In addition to his work for ballet companies he was active in television, musicals, non-musical drama, and opera.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} album, Carey {{embarked}} {{on her first}} headlining concert tour, the Music Box Tour. Due to <b>stage</b> <b>fright,</b> Carey had not toured to promote her previous albums and did not originally plan a tour to support Music Box. However, after the continued success of the album and persuasion from Tommy Mottola, Carey agreed. Because Carey did not feel physically or emotionally ready for an extensive tour, six concerts were scheduled, each with many days in between, {{in order to give}} her voice time to rest. An extra performance at Proctor's Theatre was planned; there, Carey filmed the one-hour special Here Is Mariah Carey for release during the Christmas season.|$|E
5|$|After Trespass was recorded, {{ill health}} and {{developing}} <b>stage</b> <b>fright</b> caused Phillips to leave Genesis. His last show {{with the band}} took place in Haywards Heath on 18 July 1970. He felt the increased number of gigs affected the group's creativity and that several songs he wrote were not recorded or performed live. He had contracted bronchial pneumonia and became isolated {{from the rest of}} the band, feeling that it had too many songwriters in it. Banks, Gabriel, and Rutherford saw Phillips as an important member, being the most instrumental in encouraging them to turn professional. They regarded his exit as the band's greatest threat and the most difficult to overcome. Gabriel and Rutherford decided they would continue; Banks agreed on the condition that they find a new drummer that was of equal stature to the rest of the group. Mayhew was therefore fired, though Phillips later thought Mayhew's working-class background clashed with the rest of the band which affected his confidence.|$|E
5|$|One day, Elliot Edwards and Claris Sinclair, two {{teenagers}} {{from the city}} of Twin Seeds, go through failures. Elliot is a basketball player who enjoys a game with his friends. He is challenged by a group of older school students and suffers a humiliating defeat on the court. Claris is a talented singer and her ambition is to perform on stage. She auditions for a part in the events commemorating the centenary of the city of Twin Seeds. Standing in front of the judges, she is overcome by <b>stage</b> <b>fright</b> and does not perform well, which causes her to lose all hopes of getting the role. When they go to sleep that night, both Elliot and Claris suffer nightmares that replay the events. They escape into Nightopia and find that they both possess the rare Red Ideya of Courage, the only type that Wizeman cannot steal.|$|E
5|$|They {{set out on}} {{the road}} with little money in a yellow 1973 Buick Skylark {{convertible}} with a guy named Ben (Anson Mount). Lucy, however, leaves without the permission of her overbearing father Pete (Dan Aykroyd), who wakes up the next day to find his daughter is gone. Shortly into their journey, the car breaks down. They realise that they don't have enough money between them for the travel or the repair costs. Mimi then suggests that she sing karaoke at a local bar, where good singers are tipped well by the customers. While at the bar, the girls dress up and go the stage to perform. However, when the song starts Mimi develops <b>stage</b> <b>fright,</b> being unable to sing. Seeing that they needed the money, Lucy takes her place, and quickly becomes a hit with the crowd. They make enough money to fix the car and continue on their way.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after being}} hired {{he was taken}} aside by the news {{producer}} and asked to read the on-air bulletin for the nightly broadcast. He read the news for three months until one night when he condensed a six-minute bulletin into three minutes. He attributed this to <b>stage</b> <b>fright,</b> which caused him to speak too fast. The rest of the production crew were not {{ready to move on}} to the next news items, leaving Harries standing in silence for several minutes. Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called him into his office and berated him, telling him he did not deserve to be on television and that he would no longer be reading the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a point that he assaulted the man. Aware that he was going to lose his job, he contacted a Granada colleague who got him a new job at Granada's London centre, which he took up at the age of 23.|$|E
5|$|While {{he still}} felt a disdain for public life, Tchaikovsky now {{participated in it}} for two reasons—his {{increasing}} celebrity, and what he felt was his duty to promote Russian music. To this end, he helped support his former pupil Sergei Taneyev, {{now director of the}} Moscow Conservatory, by attending student examinations and negotiating the sometimes sensitive relations among various members of the staff. Tchaikovsky also served as director of the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society during the 1889–90 season. In this post, he invited a number of international celebrities to conduct, including Johannes Brahms, Antonín Dvořák and Jules Massenet. Tchaikovsky promoted Russian music both in his own compositions and in his role as a guest conductor. In January 1887 he substituted at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow on short notice for the first three performances of his opera Cherevichki. Conducting was something the composer had wanted to master for at least a decade, as he saw that success outside Russia depended to some extent on conducting his own works. Within a year of the Cherevichki performances, Tchaikovsky was in considerable demand throughout Europe and Russia, which helped him overcome a life-long <b>stage</b> <b>fright</b> and boosted his self-assurance.|$|E
25|$|Paruresis is {{also known}} by many colloquial terms, {{including}} bashful bladder, bashful kidneys, <b>stage</b> <b>fright,</b> pee-shyness, and shy bladder syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Hitchcock {{used this}} long-take {{approach}} again {{to a lesser}} extent on his next film, Under Capricorn (1949) and in a very limited way in his film <b>Stage</b> <b>Fright</b> (1950).|$|E
25|$|On Tuesday, January 25, 1949, Scott {{collapsed}} {{and went into}} hysterics on the RKO set of The Big Steal (1949). She immediately quit {{after three days of}} production. According to Scott's replacement, Jane Greer, Scott quit because she was concerned about being associated with the leading man, Robert Mitchum, who at the time was jailed at the local honor farm for a marijuana conviction—Mitchum was convicted January 10, 1949. It was also later alleged that Hal Wallis was supposedly responsible for Scott's bowing out. Yet, Scott starred with Mitchum in a RKO film two years later. During this same period, the press reported rumors of Scott's <b>stage</b> <b>fright,</b> an ailment common to actors. Scott herself has admitted to <b>stage</b> <b>fright,</b> explaining her absence during premieres of her films.|$|E
25|$|Hedberg {{suffered}} from <b>stage</b> <b>fright</b> throughout his career; he often performed in sunglasses, {{with his head}} down and his hair in his face or his eyes closed, and sometimes stood upstage or {{with his back to the}} audience, constantly moving in place. At times, he nervously shook his microphone unconsciously.|$|E
25|$|The 1950 Alfred Hitchcock film <b>Stage</b> <b>Fright</b> (1950) {{uses the}} device of {{unreliable}} narration by presenting {{the aftermath of}} a murder in a flashback, as told by the murderer. The details of the flashback provide an explanation which helps convince the innocent main protagonist of the film to help the murderer, believing him innocent.|$|E
25|$|Later that year, Maniac {{left the}} band. According to Necrobutcher, {{this was due}} to his {{alcoholism}} induced by <b>stage</b> <b>fright.</b> Necrobutcher explained that because of this tendency, a violent encounter between the singer and Blasphemer lead to the guitarist kicking Maniac down a flight of stairs, resulting in injury. Csihar was reinstated as his replacement.|$|E
25|$|Leonard briefly {{moved to}} the USA in 1981, where he worked on Walter Egan's album The Last Stroll, before rejoining Sean Tyla to form The Force with Micky Groome (bass) and Paul Simmons (drums). After {{extensive}} touring, they recorded an eponymous album, The Force but Tyla suffered severe <b>stage</b> <b>fright</b> and left the band, which became another Iceberg.|$|E
25|$|In a 1987 {{study by}} the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians, 27% of interviewed members {{admitted}} to using beta blockers such as propranolol for musical performances. For about 10–16% of performers, their degree of <b>stage</b> <b>fright</b> is considered pathological. Propranolol is used by musicians, actors, and public speakers {{for its ability to}} treat anxiety symptoms activated by the sympathetic nervous system.|$|E
25|$|On 16 February 2015, it was {{announced}} that drummer, Josh Morgan, was to temporarily leave the band after suffering from acute <b>stage</b> <b>fright</b> caused by Asperger Syndrome. A professional drummer and friend of the band was asked to take over from Morgan's position while he sought help for his condition. Morgan later rejoined the band on tour some weeks later.|$|E
25|$|Scott's <b>stage</b> <b>fright</b> was worsening. During the October 19, 1952 live {{broadcast}} of NBC's Colgate Comedy Hour, Scott reportedly hid in her dressing room until the casting director, Howard Ross, taunted her {{to face the}} audience. By the end of October 1952, of the original 48 big-name actors under contract to Paramount in 1947, only four were left—Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, William Holden, and Lizabeth Scott.|$|E
25|$|Orbison's severe <b>stage</b> <b>fright</b> was {{particularly}} noticeable in the 1970s and early 1980s. During {{the first few}} songs in a concert, the vibrato in his voice was almost uncontrollable, but afterward, it became stronger and more dependable. This also happened with age. Orbison noticed that {{he was unable to}} control the tremor in the late afternoon and evenings, and chose to record in the mornings when it was possible.|$|E
25|$|During {{her first}} {{performance}} on stage {{when she was}} much younger, she had gotten <b>stage</b> <b>fright</b> though {{a little boy who}} was in the play managed to help her get over it. On her first day at school, she recognizes Leo as the little boy who helped her during her first play, though it took more of a reminder via her pig tails and the childish phrase daikon meaning poor actor which earned him a slap in the face.|$|E
25|$|Hitchcock filmed <b>Stage</b> <b>Fright</b> (1950) at {{studios in}} Elstree, England {{where he had}} worked during his British International Pictures {{contract}} many years before. He matched one of Warner Bros.' most popular stars, Jane Wyman, with the expatriate German actress Marlene Dietrich and used several prominent British actors, including Michael Wilding, Richard Todd and Alastair Sim. This was Hitchcock's first proper production for Warner Bros., which had distributed Rope and Under Capricorn, because Transatlantic Pictures was experiencing financial difficulties.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1940s, Sim {{was cast}} in {{starring}} roles in films. His earliest successes as a leading man included the police detective in the thriller Green for Danger (1946); the headmaster of Nutbourne College, co-starring with Margaret Rutherford, in the farcical comedy The Happiest Days of Your Life (1950); and a writer of lurid crime fiction in the comedy Laughter in Paradise (1951). His other films included Waterloo Road (1944), London Belongs to Me (1948), Alfred Hitchcock's <b>Stage</b> <b>Fright</b> (1950), Scrooge (A Christmas Carol) (1951), Folly to Be Wise (1953) and An Inspector Calls (1954).|$|E
25|$|Arthur {{turned down}} {{the role of the}} female missionary in Lost Horizon (1973), the {{unsuccessful}} musical remake of the 1937 Frank Capra film of the same name. Then, in 1975, the Broadway play First Monday in October, about the first woman to be a Supreme Court justice, was written especially with Arthur in mind, but once again she succumbed to extreme <b>stage</b> <b>fright,</b> and quit the production shortly into its out-of-town run after leaving the Cleveland Play House. The play went on with Jane Alexander playing the role intended for Arthur.|$|E
25|$|The Band rented The Woodstock Playhouse in Woodstock, New York {{with the}} intent of {{recording}} a new live album there, but the city council voted against it, so they recorded on location, but without an audience. Robertson handled most of the songwriting duties as before. Robertson brought in Todd Rundgren to engineer the album. The album was recorded in two weeks' time. These sessions became their third album, <b>Stage</b> <b>Fright,</b> which would become The Band's highest charting album, peaking at #5 on September 5 and staying in the Billboard Top 40 for 14 weeks.|$|E
25|$|After high school, Makino {{moved to}} the United States as a foreign {{exchange}} student and enrolled in college in New York City where she studied art. She met Italian twin brothers Simone and Amedeo Pace in 1993 in a New York City Italian restaurant. The meeting was orchestrated by a friend who felt the group would have a good musical chemistry, {{which resulted in the}} conception of the alternative rock band Blonde Redhead in 1993. Makino has stated that she had never intended to have a career in music, and that she also suffers from <b>stage</b> <b>fright.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following {{their second}} album, The Band {{embarked}} {{on their first}} tour as a lead act. The anxiety of fame was clear, as the group's songs turned to darker themes of fear and alienation: the influence on their next work is self-explanatory. <b>Stage</b> <b>Fright</b> (1970) was engineered by musician-engineer-producer Todd Rundgren and recorded on a theatre stage in Woodstock, but the fraying of the group's once-fabled unity was beginning to show. As on their previous, self-titled record, Robertson was credited {{with most of the}} songwriting. However, the trademark vocal style of The Band's three lead singers was much less prominent on this work.|$|E
25|$|Fry {{was cast}} in Simon Gray's The Common Pursuit for its first staging in London's West End on 7 April 1988, with Rik Mayall, John Sessions, Sarah Berger, Paul Mooney and John Gordon Sinclair, {{directed}} by Simon Gray. He was also cast in a lead role in Simon Gray's 1995 play Cell Mates, which he left three days into the West End run, pleading <b>stage</b> <b>fright.</b> He later recalled the incident as a hypomanic episode in his documentary about bipolar disorder, The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive. In 2007, Fry wrote a Christmas pantomime, Cinderella, which ran at London's Old Vic Theatre.|$|E
25|$|Since {{singing is}} a {{performing}} art, voice teachers spend {{some of their}} time preparing their students for performance. This includes teaching their students etiquette of behavior on stage such as bowing, addressing problems like <b>stage</b> <b>fright</b> or nervous tics, {{and the use of}} equipment such as microphones. Some students may also be preparing for careers in the fields of opera or musical theater where acting skills are required. Many voice instructors will spend time on acting techniques and audience communication with students in these fields of interest. Students of opera also {{spend a great deal of}} time with their voice teachers learning foreign language pronunciations.|$|E
25|$|Arthur's post-retirement work {{in theater}} was intermittent, {{somewhat}} curtailed by her unease and discomfort about working in public. Capra claimed she vomited in her dressing room between scenes, yet emerged each time {{to perform a}} flawless take. According to John Oller's biography, Jean Arthur: The Actress Nobody Knew (1997), Arthur developed a kind of <b>stage</b> <b>fright</b> punctuated with bouts of psychosomatic illnesses. A prime example was in 1945, when she was cast in {{the lead of the}} Garson Kanin play, Born Yesterday. Her nerves and insecurity got the better of her and she left the production before it reached Broadway, opening the door for a then-unknown Judy Holliday to take the part.|$|E
25|$|When Laurence Olivier {{gave his}} {{acclaimed}} performance of Othello at the Royal National Theatre (UK) in 1964, {{he had developed}} a case of <b>stage</b> <b>fright</b> that was so profound {{that when he was}} alone onstage, Frank Finlay (who was playing Iago) would have to stand offstage where Olivier could see him to settle his nerves. This performance was recorded complete on LP, and filmed by popular demand in 1965 (according to a biography of Olivier, tickets for the stage production were notoriously hard to get). The film version still holds the record for the most Oscar nominations for acting ever given to a Shakespeare film — Olivier, Finlay, Maggie Smith (as Desdemona) and Joyce Redman (as Emilia, Iago's wife) were all nominated for Academy Awards.|$|E
25|$|Grossman {{recommended}} Rundgren to Robbie Robertson of The Band as {{the engineer}} for an album Robertson was producing, by singer-songwriter Jesse Winchester, {{who was at}} the time living in exile in Canada to avoid the draft. This was followed by a live album for the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Having impressed Robertson with his work on the Winchester LP, Rundgren was then asked to engineer The Band's third album, <b>Stage</b> <b>Fright,</b> which was recorded in a series of sessions at the Woodstock Playhouse. One of these was attended by New York writer Patti Smith, and their chance meeting led to an enduring friendship. Smith wrote several strongly positive reviews of Rundgren's early solo work in the rock press, and in 1979 Rundgren produced the final Patti Smith Group album Wave.|$|E
25|$|People facing anxiety may {{withdraw}} from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past. There are {{various types of}} anxiety. Existential anxiety can occur when a person faces angst, an existential crisis, or nihilistic feelings. People can also face mathematical anxiety, somatic anxiety, <b>stage</b> <b>fright,</b> or test anxiety. Social anxiety and stranger anxiety are caused when people are apprehensive around strangers or other people in general. Furthermore, anxiety has been linked with physical symptoms such as IBS and can heighten other mental health illnesses such as OCD and panic disorder. The {{first step in the}} management of a person with anxiety symptoms is to evaluate the possible presence of an underlying medical cause, whose recognition is essential in order to decide its correct treatment. Anxiety symptoms may be masking an organic disease, or appear associated or {{as a result of a}} medical disorder.|$|E
