On 2 May, the regiment's A Company was the leading element of the 2nd New Zealand Division and entered Trieste. While most of the German garrison quickly surrendered, it was necessary to deal with some diehard elements who refused to <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> either the New Zealanders or the Yugoslav partisans also present in the city. In fact, the partisans were reluctant to allow Germans to <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> the New Zealanders at all.|$|E

In these transit camps, the surrendered civilians were registered and interrogated. Those who were suspected of being members of the resistance were killed.|$|E

5|$|By late October, the German {{forces were}} worn out, {{with only a}} third of their motor {{vehicles}} still functioning, infantry divisions at third- to half-strength, and serious logistics issues preventing the delivery of warm clothing and other winter equipment to the front. Even Hitler seemed to <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> the idea of a long struggle, since the prospect of sending tanks into such a large city without heavy infantry support seemed risky after the costly capture of Warsaw in 1939.|$|E

5|$|Géza's and Solomon's {{relationship}} only {{began to}} worsen {{during the siege}} of the Byzantine fortress of Belgrade in 1071. Its commander preferred to <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> Géza instead of the king and the Byzantine envoys who arrived in the Hungarian camp {{after the fall of}} Belgrade only negotiated with Géza. The division of the booty also gave rise to a new conflict between Solomon and Géza. Although Géza accompanied the king on a new campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 1072, but his brother, Ladislaus stayed behind with half of the troops of their duchy.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about Kanhopatra. According to most {{traditional}} accounts, Kanhopatra was a courtesan and dancing-girl.

She died in the central shrine of Vithoba in Pandharpur. She {{is the only person}} whose samadhi (mausoleum) is within the precincts of the temple.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 5th Battalion moved {{north of}} Khafji to block Iraqi {{reinforcements}} attempting {{to reach the}} city. This unit was further bolstered by the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade, and heavily aided by Coalition air support.
