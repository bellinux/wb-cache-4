50|$|The Pig genome {{currently}} has annotated 2,842 VEGA genes--of which, 2,264 are projected protein-coding genes (September 2012, release). The pig {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC), {{also known as the}} swine leukocyte antigen complex (SLA), spans a 2.4Mb region of <b>submetacentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> 7 (SSC7p1.1-q1.1). Implicated in the control of immune response and susceptibility to a range of diseases, the pig MHC plays a unique role in histocompatibility.

40|$|The genetic {{monitoring}} of interspecific hybrids involves {{the application of}} methodologies able to provide an easy and indubitable genetic characterization of both parental and hybrid individuals. In the present work, cytogenetic techniques were used to identify a hybrid lineage of "Piaupara" in order to caracterize them {{in relation to the}} parental species, Leporinus macrocephalus (piauçu) and L. elongatus (piapara). The cytogenetic analysis revealed that L. macrocephalus presented 2 n = 54 chromosomes and a nucleolar organizer regions (NOR) at the telomere of the long arm of the <b>submetacentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> pair 2. Analysis of constitutive heterochromatin (C-banding) revealed a conspicuous block at the pericentromeric region on the long arm of a <b>submetacentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> pair. L. elongatus presented the same diploid number, 2 n = 54, and a karyotypic formula similar to that of L. macrocephalus. The NORs were also at the telomere of the long arm of the submetacentric pair 2, which was morphologically different from that of L. macrocephalus. Heterochromatic blocks were observed at both telomeres of a <b>submetacentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> pair. The hybrid "Piaupara" presented the same diploid number (2 n = 54) and karyotypic formula as the parental species and there were no visible differences between parental and hybrid individuals. Differently from the Giemsa staining, NOR- and C-banding analysis showed marked differences which allowed the identification of the hybrids by the different morphology and/or size of the chromosomes carrying the NORs and patterns of heterochromatin distribution in their chromosomes. Such genetic studies are important for fish culture since they can provide tools for monitoring natural and artificial hybridization. They are also useful in biological conservation programmes and in the proper management of natural and reared fish stocks. Copyright © 2008, Sociedade Brasileira de Genética...|$|E
40|$|Evidence for {{assigning}} {{the locus}} determining {{the structure of}} adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) to human chromosome No. 16 is presented. Hybrids of APRT-deficient mouse cells and of human fibroblasts having normal APRT were isolated by fusing the parental cells with Sendai virus, blocking de novo purine nucleotide synthesis with azaserine and selecting for hybrids that could use exogenous adenine. The hybrid clones that were studied had only APRT activity that was indistinguishable from human APRT with regard to electrophoretic migration and reaction with antibodies against the partially purified human enzyme. No. 16 was the only human chromosome consistently present {{in all of the}} clones, and in one clone, it was the only human chromosome detected. Selection against hybrid cells with 2, 6 -diaminopurine (DAP) yielded DAP-resistant survivors that lacked chromosome No. 16. One hybrid that originally had an intact No. 16 yielded adenine-utilizing subclones that lacked No. 16 but had a new <b>submetacentric</b> <b>chromosome.</b> The distribution of centromere-associated heterochromatin and the fluorescence pattern indicated that this chromosome consisted of a mouse telocentric chromosome and the long arm of No. 16. Cells having the <b>submetacentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> had human APRT. Both the enzyme and the chromosome were absent in DAP-resistant derivatives. These results suggest that the structure of APRT is defined by a locus on the long arm of human chromosome No. 16...|$|E

Cerdocyon thous is a representative of the Canidae, living in the forests, open wooded areas and savannahs of South America. Compared to other canid species, C. thous has a large proportion of metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes as well as a large amount of constitutive heterochromatin, especially along the short arm of submetacentric chromosomes. In the present study, different chromosome banding methods were used to characterize the heterogeneous nature of the large heterochromatic segments and to propose an organizational model for this segment that occupies the entire short arm of most two-armed chromosomes.

Presumably, this is attributable, in large part, to the fact that their karyotype contains a large number of very small elements that do not lend themselves easily to such analyses.

The Ag-NORs, 18 S rDNA and CMA 3 signals were coincident in location occupying the short arm of an acrocentric chromosome pair (23 th), in a secondary constriction. The 5 S rDNA genes were localized near the centromere on the short arms of one <b>submetacentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> pair.
