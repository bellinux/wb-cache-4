A hurricane wind load simulation was applied to MPC heel joints to determine if a large scale wind event would cause strength loss or change the joint stiffness. An "impact" load of one second duration (as defined by the American Forest and Paper Association (AFPA) (1991)) was also applied to MPC heel <b>joints</b> and tension <b>splice</b> <b>joints.</b> Two different impact loads were applied to MPC tension <b>splice</b> <b>joints</b> to determine if strength degradation or stiffness change occurs due to loads with short duration and high maximum load. Finally, MPC tension <b>splice</b> <b>joints</b> were subjected to a ramp load which linearly increased ten times faster than the control group ramp load to determine if shorter duration tests still produce "static" loading results. All observed properties were compared to a control group which was subjected to a static ramp load. Both MPC heel and tension <b>splice</b> <b>joints</b> exhibited non-linear behavior under static ramp loads and failed with little warning because the tests were load- controlled. Tooth withdrawal, wood shear failure, and plate failure modes were all seen for both types of MPC joints. Heel joints tested with the top member in tension proved to have 17...|$|R

The experimental program consisted of three double-lap shear coupon tests and five large-scale beam tests. Different methods to reduce the bond stress concentrations near the plate ends were investigated including increasing {{the length of the}} splice cover plate and implementing a reverse-tapered plate end configuration. Three-dimensional linear and non-linear finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted to study the cracking behavior of the <b>splice</b> <b>joints</b> and to determine the effect of the reverse-taper on the interface shear and normal (peeling) stress distributions near the plate ends.

The Stereo 8 version doubled the amount of programming on the tape by providing eight total tracks, usually comprising four programs of two tracks each.

40|$|The {{attachment}} joints {{are inevitable}} in any large structure like an airframe. Splicing is normally used {{to retain a}} clean aerodynamic surface of the wing skin. The wings {{are the most important}} lift-producing part of the aircraft. Wings vary in design depending upon the aircraft type and its purpose. The wing box has two crucial joints, the skin <b>splice</b> <b>joint</b> and spar <b>splice</b> <b>joint.</b> Top and bottom skins of inboard and outboard portions are joined together by means of skin splicing. Front and rear spars of inboard and outboard are joined together by means of spar splicing. The skins resist much of the bending moment in the wing and the spars resist the shear force. In this study the chord-wise splicing of wing skin is considered for a detailed analysis. The splicing is considered as a multi row riveted joint under the action of tensile in plane load due to wing bending. Stress analysis of the joint is carried out to compute the stresses at rivet holes due to by-pass load and bearing load. The stresses are estimated using the finite element approach with the help of PATRAN/NASTRAN. In a structure like airframe, a fatigue crack will appear at the location of high tensile stress. Further these locations are invariably the sites of high stress concentration. Life prediction requires a model for fatigue damage accumulation, constant amplitude S-N (stress life) data for various stress ratios and local stress history at the stress concentration The response of the <b>splice</b> <b>joint</b> will be evaluated.
