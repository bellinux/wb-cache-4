5|$|Important {{literary}} {{contributions in}} Kannada were made {{not only by}} court poets, noblemen, royalty, ascetics and saints who wrote in the marga (mainstream) style, but also by commoners and artisans, including cobblers, weavers, cowherds and shepherds who wrote in the desi (folk) style. These Vachana poets (called Vachanakaras) revolutionised Kannada literature, rejecting traditional themes that eulogised kings and noblemen, and writing didactic poems that were closer to the <b>spoken</b> <b>and</b> sung form of the language. In addition to hundreds of male poets, over thirty female poets have been recorded, some of whom wrote along with their husbands.|$|E

A quasi-experimental study of non-equivalent pretest-posttest control group design or comparison group design was used in this research. The population of this {{research was}} the all first semester undergraduate students of urban and regional planning study program of Indo Global Mandiri University. Forty students were selected as the sample by using purposive sampling technique in which each group consisted of 20 students, respectively. The treatment was given for 14 meetings. This research was primarily concerned on the quantitative data {{in the form of the}} students’ <b>speaking</b> <b>and</b> writing scores. Rubrics were used to measure the students’ <b>speaking</b> <b>and</b> writing achievements. The findings showed that (1) there was a significant improvement in <b>speaking</b> <b>and</b> writing achievements where t-obtained of speaking skill by using rubric was 16. 110 (p< 0. 000) and t-obtained of writing skill by using rubric was 18. 291 (p< 0. 000), (2) there was also a significant mean difference in <b>speaking</b> <b>and</b> writing achievements between the experimental and control groups were 4. 533 (p< 0. 000) and 3. 504 (p< 0. 000), (3) the aspect of <b>speaking</b> <b>and</b> writing skill gave high contribution on the students’ <b>speaking</b> <b>and</b> writing achievements in the experimental group. The highest contribution of speaking skill aspect toward the speaking achievement was fluency. Meanwhile the highest contribution of writing skill aspect toward the writing achievement was vocabulary.

40|$|Dyspnea (breathing discomfort) is {{a serious}} and {{pervasive}} problem that can have {{a profound impact on}} quality of life. It can manifest in different qualities (air hunger, physical exertion, chest/lung tightness, and mental concentration, among others) and intensities (barely noticeable to intolerable) and can influence a person’s emotional state (causing anxiety, fear, and frustration, among others). Dyspnea can make it difficult to perform daily activities, including <b>speaking</b> <b>and</b> swallowing. In fact, dyspnea can cause people to change the way they <b>speak</b> <b>and</b> swallow in their attempts to relieve their breathing discom-fort; in extreme cases, it can even cause people to avoid <b>speaking</b> <b>and</b> eating/drinking.

5|$|Apart {{from the}} Imperial court, {{administration}} and military, the primary language {{used in the}} eastern Roman provinces even before {{the decline of the}} Western Empire was Greek, having been spoken in the region for centuries before Latin. Following Rome's conquest of the east its 'Pax Romana', inclusionist political practices and development of public infrastructure, facilitated the further spreading and entrenchment of Greek language in the east. Indeed, early on {{in the life of the}} Roman Empire, Greek had become the common language of the Church, the language of scholarship and the arts, and, to a large degree, the lingua franca for trade between provinces and with other nations. Greek for a time became diglossic with the spoken language, known as Koine (eventually evolving into Demotic Greek), used alongside an older written form until Koine won out as the <b>spoken</b> <b>and</b> written standard.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew {{after the}} Second Temple period evolved into Mishnaic Hebrew, which ceased being <b>spoken</b> <b>and</b> {{developed}} into a literary language around 200 CE.

Currently, Classical Hebrew is generally taught in public schools in Israel, and Biblical Hebrew forms are sometimes used in Modern Hebrew literature, much as archaic and biblical constructions are used in Modern English literature. Since Modern Hebrew contains many biblical elements, Biblical Hebrew is fairly intelligible to Modern Hebrew speakers.|$|E

5|$|I {{realize that}} many good and able men have eloquently <b>spoken</b> <b>and</b> written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} this Court to keep the Constitution {{in tune with the}} times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it is good enough for me.|$|E
5|$|In this way, the Quenya {{language}} was {{symbolic of the}} high status of the Elves, the firstborn of the races of Middle-earth, because of their close connection to Valinor, and its decreasing use also became symbolic of the slowly declining Elven culture in Middle-earth. In the Second Age of Middle-earth's chronology the Men of Númenor learnt the Quenya tongue. In the Third Age, {{the time of the}} setting of The Lord of the Rings, Quenya was learnt as a second language by all Elves of Noldorin origin, and it continued to be used in <b>spoken</b> <b>and</b> written form, but their mother-tongue was the Sindarin of the Grey-elves. As the Noldor remained in Middle-earth, their Noldorin dialect of Quenya also gradually diverged from the Vanyarin dialect spoken in Valinor, undergoing both sound changes and grammatical changes.|$|E

5|$|Languages evolve and diversify over time, and {{the history}} of their {{evolution}} can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family. The Indo-European family is the most widely <b>spoken</b> <b>and</b> includes languages as diverse as English, Russian and Hindi; the Sino-Tibetan family, which includes Mandarin, Bodo and the other Chinese languages, and Tibetan; the Afro-Asiatic family, which includes Arabic, Somali, and Hebrew; the Bantu languages, which include Swahili, and Zulu, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout Africa; and the Malayo-Polynesian languages, which include Indonesian, Malay, Tagalog, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the Pacific. The languages of the Dravidian family that are spoken mostly in Southern India include Tamil and Telugu.
