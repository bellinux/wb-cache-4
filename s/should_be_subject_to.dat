Since 2000, employees of MI6 {{have had the}} same employment rights as other British citizens, including written contracts and access to employment tribunals. However, MI6 refused to allow these procedures to be applied retroactively to Tomlinson's case. MI6 have not succeeded in obtaining another PII certificate since the Tomlinson case.|$|E
5|$|Chesney's acta, or documents, contain many {{examples}} of him settling judicial disputes, demonstrating how active {{he was in his}} diocese. More than 240 of his acta have survived, many of them concerning the religious houses within his jurisdiction. Chesney was appointed a papal judge-delegate at least once, and it was in his court that the case of Philip de Broy, a canon in Bedfordshire accused of murdering a knight, was heard. The case was one of those that contributed to King Henry's determination that criminous clerks <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> royal justice, not just ecclesiastical justice.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, {{both parties}} made similar {{proposals}} to reduce authoritarianism {{and the political}} influence of the military, and to maintain the Argentine claim in the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute. Alfonsín denounced a pact {{between the military and}} the Peronist unions that sought an amnesty for the military. He maintained that the armed forced <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> the civilian government, and that unions should be regulated. He also proposed an investigation into the actions of the military during the Dirty War. He closed his campaign by reading the preamble of the constitution of Argentina. The last rally was at the Plaza de la República, and was attended by 400,000 people.|$|E

5|$|Deal Castle was {{increasingly}} resembling a private house, rather than purely a fortification, and {{this led to}} arguments in 1829 {{as to whether it}} <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> local taxation as a private dwelling, or continue to be exempt as a military site. The captaincy had long since become an honorary position, given out as a reward by the Crown. In 1898, the War Office agreed that the Office of Works should be consulted over any external alterations to the historic castle, and that the Office of Works would be responsible for paying for any resulting work. The War Office finally concluded in 1904 that the castle no longer had any value either as a defence or as a barracks, and transferred it entirely to the Office of Works. When the captain was not in residence it was opened to visitors.|$|E
5|$|Trusts {{where the}} {{doctrine}} is applicable {{are divided into}} two groups; those with subsequent failure, where the trust's purpose has failed after it came into operation, and initial failure, where the trust's purposes are immediately invalid. Subsequent failure cases simply require the redirection of the funds to the nearest possible purpose, {{since there is no}} question of allowing the settlor's next of kin to inherit the money. Initial failure cases, however, require not just a decision on whether the purpose has failed, but also on whether the funds <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> cy-près or returned to the estate in a resulting trust. This is decided based on the charitable intention of the settlor, something determined on the facts of each individual case.|$|E

25|$|This was {{followed}} in September by the Corley Report {{on behalf of}} the Institute of Actuaries, which recommended, amongst other things, that the Appointed Actuary should require that there is a process for reviewing communications to policyholders, and should resist holding a dual role as Chief Executive, and that his work <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> peer review.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{its long}} {{establishment}} within his kingdom, Afonso {{believed that the}} slave trade <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> Kongo law. When he suspected the Portuguese of receiving illegally enslaved persons to sell, he wrote to King João III of Portugal in 1526 imploring him {{to put a stop}} to the practice. Ultimately, Afonso decided to establish a special committee to determine the legality of the enslavement of those who were being sold.|$|E
25|$|White parted {{company with}} Rehnquist in {{strongly}} supporting the Supreme Court decisions striking down laws that discriminated {{on the basis}} of sex, agreeing with Justice William J. Brennan in 1973's Frontiero v. Richardson that laws discriminating {{on the basis of}} sex <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> strict scrutiny. However, only three justices joined Brennan's plurality opinion in Frontiero; in later cases gender discrimination cases would be subjected to intermediate scrutiny (see Craig v. Boren).|$|E
25|$|After careful consideration, {{including}} {{a review of}} my recommendation, the President has concluded that given a number of factors, {{including a}} documented history of discrimination, classifications based on sexual orientation <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> a more heightened standard of scrutiny. The President has also concluded that Section 3 of DOMA, as applied to legally married same-sex couples, fails to meet that standard and is therefore unconstitutional. Given that conclusion, the President has instructed the Department not to defend the statute in such cases.|$|E

50|$|Attitudes {{around the}} world to {{prostitution}} and how it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> regulated (if at all) vary considerably, and have varied over time.

50|$|We cannot {{agree that}} it <b>should</b> {{automatically}} <b>be</b> declared illegal {{in all of its}} many manifestations.

25|$|The {{threat model}} for OFFICIAL data {{is similar to}} typical large private-sector organisations; it anticipates that {{individual}} hackers, pressure groups, criminals, and investigative journalists might attempt to get information. The threat model does not guarantee protection against very persistent and skilled attacks, for instance by organised crime groups or by foreign governments; these are possible, but normal controls would make them more difficult, and much stronger controls would be disproportionate. People with routine access to OFFICIAL information <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> BPSS screening.|$|E
25|$|Lane was an {{advocate}} of direct democracy and led an unsuccessful voter referendum to establish municipal ownership of the Portland electric system. A flurry of measures were taken before the voters — 32 proposals in 1909 alone. Among his successes at the polls in these direct votes, Lane was instrumental in winning approval of a new mandate that future utility franchises granted by the city <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> popular vote rather than back-room dealmaking between interested parties and elected politicians.|$|E
25|$|A {{large amount}} of {{parliamentary}} time was spent debating {{the application of the}} cab-rank rule to new legal professionals granted rights of audience – the Bar argued that all people with rights of audience in the higher courts <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> the same rules as barristers, while the Law Society argued that solicitors were not at that time bound by the cab-rank rule in their dealings in the lower courts, {{and that there was no}} reason why this should not be extended to the higher courts.|$|E

25|$|Concerns were {{expressed}} over {{the lack of}} checks on the Minister's power to issue a prohibiting or restraining order. It was suggested that the Minister's decision <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> judicial review or an appeal process since a decision made by a single minister could be fairly subjective, and if the decision-making power lay solely within the Minister's purview this might may fail to convince the public that any decision made was just and fair. Another suggestion raised in Parliament was to widen the purely advisory powers of the PCMR and grant it a more substantial power {{to act as a}} check and balance to the powers of the Minister.|$|E
25|$|Kublai {{promoted}} {{economic growth}} by rebuilding the Grand Canal, repairing public buildings, and extending highways. However, his domestic policy included {{some aspects of}} the old Mongol living traditions, and as his reign continued, these traditions would clash increasingly frequently with traditional Chinese economic and social culture. Kublai decreed that partner merchants of the Mongols <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> taxes in 1263 and set up the Office of Market Taxes to supervise them in 1268. After the Mongol conquest of the Song, the merchants expanded their operations to the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean. In 1286, maritime trade was put under the Office of Market Taxes. The main source of revenue of the government was the monopoly of salt production.|$|E
25|$|In {{his famous}} work, Adhyatmopanisatprakarana {{he argued that}} no body of ‘theory’ (sastra), whether Jain or non-Jain, is to be {{accepted}} merely {{on the basis of}} sectarian interest. Instead, the theory <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> testing, just as the purity of a sample of gold is determined by tests involving rubbing, cutting and heating (1.17) In one of the ethical works, the Jnanasara, Yashovijaya describes 32 moral and intellectual virtues that constitute a virtuous character. Out of these, two are distinctive: neutrality (madhyasthata) and groundedness in all view-points (sarvanayasraya). Neutrality is explained in terms of the dispassionate use of reason: a person who embodies this virtue follows wherever reason leads, rather than using reason only to defend prior opinions (16.2). Yashovijaya stresses that neutrality is not an end in itself, but a means to another end. We adopt a neutral attitude, he says, in the hope it leads to well-being (hita), just as someone who knows that one among a group of herbs is restorative but does not know which one it is, acts reasonably if they swallow the entire lot (16.8).|$|E
40|$|Microeconomic {{results of}} the {{enterprise}} and macroeconomic efficiency are sometimes consistent and other times contradictory.

However, they may be cooked or roasted and used for jams, marmalade, jellies, or pudding.|$|R
