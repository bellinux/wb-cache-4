5|$|One of President Garfield's more wearying duties {{was seeing}} office seekers, {{and he saw}} Guiteau at least once. White House {{officials}} suggested to Guiteau that he approach Blaine, as the consulship was within the Department of State. Blaine also saw the public regularly, and Guiteau became a regular at these sessions. Blaine, who {{had no intention of}} giving Guiteau a position he was unqualified for and had not earned, <b>simply</b> <b>stated</b> that the deadlock in the Senate over Robertson's nomination made it impossible to consider the Paris consulship, which required Senate confirmation. Once the New York senators had resigned, and Robertson had been confirmed as Collector, Guiteau pressed his claim, and Blaine told him he would not receive the position.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, the Japanese government's {{position}} is that the proper avenues for further claims are {{the governments of the}} respective claimants. As a result, every individual compensation claim brought to Japanese court has failed. Such was the case in regard to a British POW who was unsuccessful in an attempt to sue the Japanese government for additional money for compensation. As a result, the British Government later paid additional compensation to all British POWs. There were complaints in Japan that the international media <b>simply</b> <b>stated</b> that the former POW was demanding compensation and failed to clarify that he was seeking further compensation, in addition to that paid previously by the Japanese government.|$|E
500|$|Throughout, Zeus was {{the focus}} of fierce {{controversy}} in both the press and military circles. Even as testing started, it was unclear if development would continue. President Eisenhower's defense secretaries, McElroy (1957–59) and Thomas S. Gates, Jr. (1959–61), were unconvinced that the system was worth the cost. Eisenhower was highly skeptical, questioning whether an effective ABM system could be developed in the 1960s. [...] Another harsh critic on cost grounds was Edward Teller, who <b>simply</b> <b>stated</b> that the exchange ratio meant the solution was to build more ICBMs.|$|E

500|$|In addition, as de Boer feared, the Ezri-centric episodes {{came in for}} criticism. DVD Talk {{described}} [...] "Prodigal Daughter" [...] as [...] "clearly {{an attempt}} to cram some back-story into Ezri {{to make up for}} the fact that she's a new character", and [...] "Field of Fire" [...] as [...] "utterly generic". The former was also considered to be the weakest of the season by the crew on the series, with Behr apologising to de Boer for it afterwards. Writer Ronald D. Moore <b>simply</b> <b>stated,</b> [...] "It was just a mess." [...] The crew nicknamed it [...] "Audra Goes Home", a reference to the 1960s western television show The Big Valley.|$|E
500|$|On the Origin of Species proved {{unexpectedly}} popular, {{with the}} entire stock of 1,250 copies oversubscribed when it went on sale to booksellers on 22 November 1859. In the book, Darwin set out [...] "one long argument" [...] of detailed observations, inferences and consideration of anticipated objections. In {{making the case for}} common descent, he included evidence of homologies between humans and other mammals. Having outlined sexual selection, he hinted that it could explain differences between human races. He avoided explicit discussion of human origins, but implied the significance of his work with the sentence; [...] "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."

500|$|This {{state highway}} was {{significantly}} extended {{in both directions}} in 1919, west to Ukiah and east to Emigrant Gap, creating what {{was known as the}} Tahoe-Ukiah Highway, connecting Ukiah and Lake Tahoe in combination with Route 37 (now I-80) and Route 38 (now SR 89). The law that defined the extension <b>simply</b> <b>stated</b> that it would connect [...] "Ukiah to Tahoe City"; the state decided in September 1925 that it would run the highway along the north shore of Clear Lake, combining with the planned Rumsey-Lower Lake Highway (Route 50, now SR 53 and SR 16) east to Wilbur Springs. With the completion of this segment in mid-1932, the highway was ready for heavy travel, and became Sign Route 20 in 1934 as part of the initial signed state route system.|$|E

500|$|Reception to {{the episode}} was positive. The episode's {{overnight}} ratings was 7.73 million viewers, 46% {{of the audience}} share, a figure that was finalised to 8.64 million viewers. The Times stated that the episode was an [...] "unqualified triumph". The Guardian commented that [...] "Shearman's script bamboozles expectations", and the episode [...] "should hopefully show 2005's kids what was always so wonderful about the iconic tin-rotters.". The London Evening Standard found the lack of surprise (namely, calling the episode [...] "Dalek") the only disappointment, and Daily Mirror <b>simply</b> <b>stated</b> that [...] "for 30 pant-shittingly wonderful minutes, BBC1's new Doctor Who {{was the best thing}} on telly. Ever." [...] In 2010 Den of Geek placed the episode as number 2 in their list of the Top 10 Dalek stories.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{graphics}} {{were positively}} received. GameSpot's Broady described them as [...] "in a league {{of their own}} among PlayStation games", while the IGN staff praised the high-resolution graphics as [...] "beautiful". Game Revolution's Mark Cooke noted the absence of cutscenes {{brought about by the}} entirety of the game being [...] "rendered on the fly beautifully" [...] and that the game could [...] "really set some new standards in Playstation graphic quality." [...] He went on to describe the animation as [...] "flawless" [...] and of [...] "cartoon quality" [...] and added that the game's [...] "creatures, environments, and story building scenes are absolutely perfect." [...] The game's audio was also well-received; Broady <b>simply</b> <b>stated</b> that the music [...] "couldn't be better", while Cooke said that Clancy Brown's [...] "hilarious satirical" [...] performance as Doctor Neo Cortex added to the game's cartoonish quality.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Card was sunk, North Vietnam made {{full use}} of the {{incident}} for propaganda purposes. On October 20, 1964, the North Vietnamese government issued a postage stamp which proclaimed an [...] "Aircraft Carrier of America sunk in the Harbor of Saigon", to praise the Viet Cong commandos who carried out the attack. The U.S. Navy refused to admit Card had been sunk even {{for a brief period}} of time, instead it <b>simply</b> <b>stated</b> Card was damaged and quickly repaired. For the remainder of 1964, the Viet Cong launched further attacks on U.S. targets such as the Brinks Hotel and Bien Hoa Air Base, but there were no significant responses from the U.S. military. Card was returned to service by 11 December 1964 and remained in service until 1970, when she was placed into the Reserve Fleet.|$|E

500|$|Between {{the date}} the invitations {{to the conference}} went out (29 November) and {{the date of the}} {{cancelled}} first meeting (9 December), the situation changed. On 5 December, the Soviet Army began a counter-offensive in front of Moscow, ending the prospect of a rapid conquest of the Soviet Union. On 7 December, the Japanese attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor, causing the U.S. to declare war on Japan the next day. The Reich government declared war on the U.S. on 11 December. Some invitees were involved in these preparations, so Heydrich postponed his meeting. Somewhere around this time, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately, rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight. At the Reich Chancellery meeting of 12 December 1941 he met with top party officials and made his intentions plain. On 18 December, Hitler discussed the fate of the Jews with Himmler in the Wolfsschanze. Following the meeting, Himmler made a note on his service calendar, which <b>simply</b> <b>stated</b> [...] "Jewish question/to be destroyed as partisans".|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, it was {{announced}} that a trilogy of videos entitled [...] "Bang Bang" [...] were to be released as a short film leading up to the broadcast of the tour special. The short film (in which multiple scenes are found in video interludes and backdrops throughout the tour) was directed by New York-based filmmaker and photographer Dikayl Rimmasch. Together with war photographer William Kaner, Rimmasch put together the filmmaking approach and aesthetic of the series. Inspired by French New Wave cinema, the short film was created using custom camera rigs that Rimmasch had designed, 50-year-old Russian lenses and lighting effects by Archie Ciotti and Scott Spencer and followed an incredibly fast, shoot-from-the-hip recording style. However, following the release of part one of the trilogy, the remaining two videos never came to surface on their scheduled release dates. When asked about this (and the deletion of part one from its original upload source), Rimmasch <b>simply</b> <b>stated</b> [...] "no comment". In February 2015, all 3 videos resurfaced online, debuting on creativeexchangeagency.com.|$|E

500|$|Idol briefly responded {{once more}} to the {{negative}} reception the album received on two occasions. In 1996, Idol gave an interview for his website {{in which he was}} asked if he'd pursue the style of Cyberpunk for a future album. Idol addressed the question by first explaining his interpretation of the failure of the album. [...] "You see the thing about Cyberpunk is that {{it was supposed to be}} like a homemade record, much like these rap bands are doing, all made really on home equipment. But it was very hard to make people understand that I was sort of making an alternative record. They don't allow you to make an alternative record..." [...] He then stated that he would not be pursuing the same style with any future album. In a 2005 interview, Idol <b>simply</b> <b>stated</b> [...] "...the idea that I was trying to do an overground-underground record just wasn't understood at the time." [...] Tony Dimitriades, a prominent music industry producer and manager, interpreted Idol's response at the time. [...] "He realized at that point, 'Well, if that's what people think, maybe I lost touch with my public.'" ...|$|E

VanDerWerff wrote that he [...] "could quibble that Vocal Adrenaline had stronger choreography overall" [...] or that he [...] "found Unique a more engaging performer than Rachel", but that as [...] "New Directions also used its whole ensemble better than Vocal Adrenaline did", he felt that [...] "either outcome seemed reasonable". Dodge <b>simply</b> <b>stated,</b> [...] "We all knew that New Directions would win and they'd get their happily ever after, but it was exciting to see it finally all play out." [...] Bell wrote that [...] "seeing the judges debate behind-the-scenes kind of takes away the entire title", though she appreciated Lohan's Freaky Friday reference. VanDerWerff said that the judging scene [...] "wasn't very good", and Votta described it as [...] "mostly waste". Futterman wrote that there was [...] "not really any emotion" [...] in Lohan's lines, though Strecker thought that the [...] "lines they gave her were pretty funny—if not a bit sad".|$|E
500|$|Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice complimented [...] "I Was Here" [...] as {{knocking}} {{harder than}} anything on 4s [...] "bloated predecessor", I Am ... Sasha Fierce (2008). Similarly, Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes wrote: [...] "'I Was Here' {{is a heavy}} brick of a song — overwrought, maudlin, delusionally grandiose — {{but it is also}} disarmingly honest about the addictive, undignified dimensions of fame and celebrity." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club described [...] "I Was Here" [...] as [...] "uncomfortably overwrought" [...] although he said that Beyoncé manages to bring conviction to its lyrical content. Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly also gave the song a mixed review stating that it reached a [...] "lifetime-movie levels of schmaltz". David Amidon of PopMatters stated that [...] "I Was Here" [...] is [...] "plain awkward to here a woman as in her prime physically as Beyoncé is to even approach such a tune. The dull music from Ryan Tedder and an army of co-producers does not help matters." [...] Michael Cragg of The Observer gave the song a negative review, stating that it disappoints as being [...] "corny bluster at odds with the laid-back feel of her most accomplished album yet." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent <b>simply</b> <b>stated</b> that [...] "I Was Here" [...] strains too hard for [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] (2009) status. Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune described the song as a [...] "toxic string of cliches".
