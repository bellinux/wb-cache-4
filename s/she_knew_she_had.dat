5|$|Peter, {{discovering}} {{a picture of}} white tulips in Olivia's book, is able to find her nearby. After they introduce themselves, Olivia admits to being scared of going home to her stepfather. Peter tells her to trust Walter and to face her fear, and then returns her to the child care center, to everyone's relief. As Olivia waits for her stepfather, she sketches {{a picture of her}} and Peter in her book. As her stepfather is about to arrive, Olivia decides she must tell Walter about him, and rushes to his office. Olivia, in tears, hands Walter the sketchbook, explaining about her stepfather's abuse and that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> crossed over to the parallel universe. She is interrupted by a sound from behind her: it is Walter. Olivia had temporarily entered the parallel universe and spoken to Walternate. Walter takes Olivia to her stepfather, but warns the man that he will be reported to social services if Olivia is harmed again.|$|E
5|$|Burnham {{was born}} on May 11, 1861 on a Dakota Sioux Indian {{reservation}} in Minnesota, to a missionary family living near the small pioneer town of Tivoli (now gone), about 20 miles (32km) from Mankato. His father, the Reverend Edwin Otway Burnham, was a Presbyterian minister educated and ordained in New York; {{he was born in}} Ghent, Kentucky. His mother Rebecca Russell Burnham had spent most of her childhood in Iowa, having emigrated with her family from Westminster, England at the age of three. In the Dakota War of 1862, Chief Little Crow and his Sioux warriors attacked the nearby town New Ulm, Minnesota; Burnham's father was in Mankato buying ammunition at the time, so when Burnham's mother saw Sioux approaching her cabin dressed in war paint, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to leave and could never escape carrying her baby. She hid Frederick in a basket of green corn husks in a corn field and fled for her life. Once the Sioux attack had been repulsed, she returned to find their house burned down, but the baby Frederick was safe, fast asleep in the basket with the corn husks.|$|E
2500|$|Bond began A String in the Harp {{while looking}} for a job after {{returning}} to the United States from a year in graduate school studying librarianship in Aberystwyth. She drew closely on her experiences and reactions to write the book, saying [...] "the American family notices and adjusts to the same things I did". She did not intend to write a fantasy. [...] "I consider myself a realistic kind of person, and it really surprised me in many ways that the first book I should write would be a fantasy." [...] According to Elizabeth Briggs in On the Inside Looking In: Contemporary Anglo-Welsh Fantasy, non-Welsh authors use Welsh mythology in their books to develop a sense of fantasy and unreality. But Bond found using Taliesin's life was a good way to introduce Welsh history into the story. Because he was already associated with the area she was writing about and his presence helped convey a sense of the country's age to her American reading audience, she chose to use him as her link to Wales' past. She needed a talisman to trigger the fantasy sections of the story, and when she read that harp keys are essential for tuning <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> found an object she could use in the book. The visions the key brings to Peter and the others tie the various elements of the story together.|$|E

2500|$|Debnam-Carey was {{surprised}} by the attention. She was new to Twitter and Instagram, and did not know what shipping (the desire by fans for two people or fictional characters to be in a romantic or platonic relationship) meant; she saw that fans had given the pairing the portmanteau [...] "Clexa". [...] "I was on Instagram or something and I checked my tagged photos, and I realized that suddenly they were all LGBT artwork. I was like, 'Oh, my god!' I had no idea. It was the first time I realized I was a figure for that community," [...] said Debnam-Carey. She called this [...] "an honor" [...] and [...] "flattering," [...] and added, [...] "It's new for our society, as well. It's one of the first shows that really has two characters in the cast that are gender and sexually fluid and embraces that. There are no labels. It's a wonderful thing to be a part of. I'm all for it." [...] While at Paleyfest 2016, she was made aware of fans raising money in her name for The Trevor Project, an organization for LGBT teenagers in need, and the fact that, at the time, $46,000 dollars had been raised. When asked if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> that much of an impact on the LGBT community, Debnam-Carey commented, [...] "Not that much, no, that's amazing." [...] As of July 13, 2016, over $135,000 dollars have been raised.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were only}} 4 {{routines}} left for each gymnast to compete. With 2 down and 2 {{to go the}} places were now: Gnauck 1st, Davydova 2nd, Shaposhnikova and Comaneci joint 3rd. Nadia Comăneci then scored a 10 on bars, the only gymnast to receive a perfect score that night. (It was her first perfect score on bars in a major competition since the 1976 Olympics). Neil Admur, New York Times, 25 July 1980, A17, [...] "The drama on the final rotation added to the suspense. Miss Gnauck was second among the 9 gymnasts on the vault, Miss Davydova seventh on the bars and Miss Comaneci eight on the beam". Maxi Gnauck held the lead until her last routine when she vaulted insecurely. She scored 9.7, on a vault with a start value of 9.9, the same as she had scored for this vault at 1979 European Championships in Denmark and 79 World Championships in United States. Barry Lorge, Washington Post, 25 July 1980, p.9, [...] "Gnauck, first of the contenders up in the fourth and final rotation. Her first vault looked good but was too safe : 9.7. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to do better but she buckled on the landing of her second vault". Peter Aykroyd, International Gymnastics : Sport, Art or Science ?, 1987, p.68, [...] "She went into the all-round finals with a slight lead, but weak vaulting lost her this advantage".|$|E
