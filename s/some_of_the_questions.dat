5|$|In {{the early}} evening Hare took the stand to give evidence. Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions,</b> and told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E
5|$|The Clemson Tigers {{began the}} 2009 season after {{finishing}} 7–6 in 2008, including a season-ending {{loss in the}} 2009 Gator Bowl to Nebraska. Heading into 2010, Clemson returned many of its 2009 players, but faced questions about whether those players would perform better with another year of experience. Also under question was head coach Dabo Swinney, who was beginning his first full season as {{head coach of the}} Tigers after assuming control in the seventh game of 2008. Clemson attempted to answer <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> about the team's potential in {{the first game of the}} season, a 37–14 win against Middle Tennessee State.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes, {{for some}} AS-level subjects, less than 0.05% of the {{candidates}} could achieve grade A. However, there was always more than 0.05% of candidates achieving grade A in the full A-level counterpart of the subjects concerned. The AS-level syllabus of a certain subject was a selected part of the AL syllabus, but the questions of an AS-level examination were as difficult as the full AL counterpart. AS-level papers shared <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> with the AL counterpart and in those questions, the marking schemes for both A-level and the AS-level were identical.|$|E

25|$|There is {{evidence}} that Nassau Senior had written the report before the data was collected– therefore evidence was used selectively to meet <b>the</b> pre-written report. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> questionnaires sent out only 10% replied and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questioned</b> directed a certain response. However, the inquiry {{was not supposed to}} be impartial, the commission wanted to change the existing system, and keeping the current system was not considered an option. The questionnaires used asked leading questions that were poorly framed leading to responses that were ambiguous or irrelevant.|$|R
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a largely {{negative}} review and awarded it one star out of four. She derided the plot, writing [...] "Why? Who knows? Who cares?" [...] Vitaris further criticized the episode {{incorporation of the}} fandom and suggested that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> asked by Harrison {{were meant to be}} [...] "making fun" [...] of [...] "fannish questions".|$|E
500|$|The {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} an inquisitorial style; witnesses were not expected to make statements but only to respond to questions asked of them. Bartlett has observed that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> asked by the commissioners were rather leading. During Cragh's interrogation, for instance, {{he was asked if}} [...] "in his country after the time of his hanging, it was publicly and commonly ascribed, and still is ascribed, to a miracle performed by the merits of the Lord Saint Thomas that he obtained and recovered life after the hanging". Cragh of course had no motivation other than to answer [...] "yes", which he did.|$|E
500|$|The season's {{exploring}} of supernatural {{and mystical}} concepts ties-in {{with the release}} of Doctor Strange, the first MCU film to explore magic. In addition to the Darkhold, this includes the introduction of Ghost Rider, with Whedon explaining in July 2016, that [...] "the Marvel [...] Universe is moving into new waters [...] We felt that [...] was obviously a great character that we’d love to have on our show that we feel fits with that shift." [...] Whedon pointed out that the previous tie-ins were sometimes [...] "very direct", and other times [...] "more thematic. The tie this year will feel more of a reflection of , less an interweaving plot." [...] He added, [...] "Hopefully <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> that we’re asking will be answered by [...] then pose some new themes and ideas for us to explore." [...] "Deals with Our Devils", aired after the release of Doctor Strange, sees Aida create a portal to rescue Coulson and Fitz from another dimension. The visuals for these are intentionally reminiscent of those used in the film. Bell added that the Darkhold [...] "feels like it belongs in the library in Kathmandu", referring to the Kamar-Taj library seen in Doctor Strange.|$|E

500|$|Amenhotep was deified {{upon his}} death and made the patron deity of the village which he opened at Deir el-Medina. His mother, who lived {{at least one year}} longer than he did, was also deified upon her death and became part of his litany. As {{previously}} mentioned, the vast majority of Amenhotep's statuary {{comes in the form of}} a funerary idol from this cult during later periods. When being worshiped, he had three deific manifestations: [...] "Amenhotep of the Town," [...] "Amenhotep Beloved of Amun," [...] and [...] "Amenhotep of the Forecourt," [...] and was known as a god who produced oracles. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> asked of him have been preserved on ostraca from Deir el-Medina, and appear to have been phrased in such a way that the idol of the king could nod (or be caused to nod) the answer. He also had a number of feasts dedicated to him which were held throughout the year. During the first month, a festival was celebrated in honor of the appearance of Amenhotep to the necropolis workmen, which probably means his idol was taken to Deir el-Medina. Another feast was held on the thirtieth of the fourth month, and then two more were held in the seventh month. The first was the [...] "spreading of the funeral couch for king Amenhotep," [...] which probably commemorated the day of his death. The second, celebrated for four days at the very end of the month, was the [...] "great festival of king Amenhotep lord of the town." [...] Later in Egyptian history, the seventh month was named after this festival, [...] "Phamenoth." [...] Another festival was held on the 27th of the ninth month, and the last known festival was held for several days between at least the eleventh and thirteenth days of the eleventh month, which in all probability commemorated the date of Amenhotep's accession to the throne.|$|E
