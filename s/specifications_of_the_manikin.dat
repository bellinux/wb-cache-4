40|$|The {{vibration}} attenuation {{performance of}} suspension seats employed in heavy vehicles {{are influenced by}} energy dissipation property <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seated body. Owing to complexities associated with biodynamic response behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human body, <b>the</b> performance assessments <b>of</b> suspension seats are invariably accomplished through laboratory or field experimentation. Such laboratory experiments involve certain safety and ethical concerns, while field measurements yield difficulties in interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results {{due to lack of}} controlled conditions. In this dissertation, two prototype anthropodynamic manikins, designed to replace human subjects in assessments of seat, are evaluated through laboratory experiments and analyses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biodynamic responses. The apparent mass (APMS) responses of manikins are characterized under different levels of vibration excitations and three body masses (55 kg, 75 kg and 98 kg). The measured responses are compared with the standardized values to assess the APMS prediction abilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikins.</b> <b>The</b> results suggest the need for deriving more reliable APMS responses of seated humans <b>of</b> particular masses. <b>The</b> applicability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikins</b> for seating dynamics is then assessed for a range of seats and vibration spectra <b>of</b> different vehicles. <b>The</b> seat effective acceleration transmissibility (S. E. A. T) of five different seats are measured using human subjects, equivalent inert mass and <b>the</b> prototype <b>manikins.</b> <b>The</b> results suggest that equivalent inert mass could provide reasonably good prediction of seat performance, when excitations dominate in the low frequency range. Under high frequency excitations, the inert mass yields poor estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seat-human system performance, while <b>the</b> <b>manikins</b> provide better estimations. The need for tuning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikins</b> was identified to improve their biodynamic response prediction abilities. An analytical model <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> was thus formulated and analyzed to perform the necessary design refinements. System identification technique was applied to derive uncertain parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model so as to satisfy the measured APMS responses for three body masses. Additional parameter identification was performed to realize desirable parameters that would satisfy the standardized biodynamic response. The results suggested that only minor refinements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prototype would be needed to enhance the biodynamic response prediction ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikin,</b> which may translate into improved applicability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> for assessment <b>of</b> suspension seats...|$|R

A manikin needs to have the following properties: shape and size, heat production, skin temperature, sweat rate, physiological responses and others. So far, no manikin satisfying all these criteria has been available. In the present study, a two-layer movable sweating thermal manikin was newly developed as a trial {{to compensate for the}} differences between conventional thermal <b>manikins</b> and <b>the</b> human body. <b>The</b> <b>manikin</b> consisted <b>of</b> two layers, a core section in the trunk and a shell section divided into 17 parts over the whole body, the temperature and heat supply of which could be independently controlled. <b>The</b> <b>manikin</b> is possible to change the posture and to walk. The sweat rate from 180 pores on the skin was controlled by peristaltic pumps. <b>The</b> temperature performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> was investigated using thermograph. As a result, <b>the</b> surface temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> decreased more in the extremities than in the trunk when <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> was exposed to 18 °C after being exposed to 28 °C for 20 min. This is analogous to the skin temperature decline in <b>the</b> extremities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human body...|$|R

40|$|Digital Human Modeling {{programs}} are important tools in virtual manufacturing that allow simulation of manual assembly work, long before any physical product has been built. By investigating the logistics, ergonomics {{and the interaction}} among the workers at an early stage, {{it may be possible}} to reduce <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> design changes, increase the quality and to decrease <b>the</b> ramp-up time <b>of</b> a manufacturing process. However, far from all assembly operations are simulated, even if all the necessary data is available. One reason is the tedious work required to setup and to define all the motions needed by a manikin to perform a simulation. In each simulation, <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> must be adjusted into the desired posture and the user must ensure that balance is held and that it avoids collision with objects in the environment. Thus, even a small case may be time consuming to simulate. This shows that there is a need of an easier way <b>of</b> instructing <b>the</b> <b>manikins.</b> In this work we propose a new formal high-level language for controlling an automated <b>manikin.</b> <b>The</b> language instructions are structured by a grammar, which defines a hierarchical tree for <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> instructions. <b>The</b> low- level instructions contains basic functionality for maneuvering <b>the</b> <b>manikin,</b> such as Move, Position and Grasp, and higher levels contain more abstract instructions such as Get and Assemble. Thus, the high-level instructions define sequences of other instructions, whereas a low-level instruction corresponds to a direct instruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikin.</b> <b>The</b> set <b>of</b> available instructions that <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> may perform during a simulation depends on <b>the</b> current state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> and <b>the</b> objects at the assembly station. Thus, properties of objects, such as grasping and mating points, also help define <b>the</b> set <b>of</b> available instructions for <b>the</b> <b>manikin.</b> <b>The</b> order in which the different parts in the assembly operations have to be connected may also be considered when constructing instruction sequences for <b>the</b> <b>manikin.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> instruction sequences may be formally verified to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> only performs valid instructions. The language have been implemented in <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> simulation software IMMA and tested on elementary cases with relevance to industrial applications. The results show that fewer steps are needed to perform a realistic simulation when the language is used compared to manually instructing <b>the</b> <b>manikin.</b> Furthermore, it is also shown that the instructions generated by the language are formally correct...|$|R

When <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> is facing-the-wind, body heat has a little effect on particle inhalation and can be neglected. However for a back-to-the-wind orientation, the situation is much more complicated as <b>the</b> source height <b>of</b> inhaled particles depends on <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> free stream. When the wind speed is low (0. 05 m/s), the critical area is located near the floor level. <b>The</b> central height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> critical area then increases with increasing free stream speed until it reaches the nose height when the wind speed rises up to 0. 25 m/s.

40|$|<b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> {{air flow}} on {{clothing}} insulation {{and on the}} dry heat transfer coefficients were evaluated for each part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clothed and nude human body. This was done by measuring clothing surface temperature using an infrared imaging radiometer. The results showed that increasing wind speed causes a decreased in clothing insulation {{and an increase in}} the dry heat transfer coefficients. <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> air penetration on dry heat transfer coefficients could be determined by comparing the heat transfer coefficients <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clothed <b>manikin</b> to those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nude <b>manikin.</b> Lastly, by comparing clothing insulation results obtained by the conventional indirect method <b>of</b> those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> direct method, in this study, one can demonstrated <b>the</b> limitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conventional method and the need for direct estimation...|$|R
