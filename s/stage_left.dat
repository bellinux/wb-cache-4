5|$|The opening <b>stage</b> <b>left</b> Porto-Vecchio {{and ended}} in Bastia, with next two stages ending in Ajaccio and Calvi respectively. The race then moved to {{mainland}} France at Nice. Stages five to eight formed a four-stage journey that navigated westwards finishing at the Ax 3 Domaines ski resort in the Pyrenees. Stage nine took place between Saint-Girons to Bagnères-de-Bigorre, before a long transfer moved the race to the north-west of the country. Stage ten finished in {{the port city of}} Saint-Malo, with the next finishing at the Mont Saint-Michel island commune in Normandy. The following four stages, 11 to 15, crossed the center of the country back to the south-east finishing atop Mont Ventoux. The next five stages took place in and around the Alps, before a second long transfer took the Tour to the finish with the Champs-Élysées stage in Paris.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} {{started at the}} Mont Saint-Michel island monastery and {{finished}} north on at Utah Beach. The second stage was held between Saint-Lô and Cherbourg-en-Cotentin. The third <b>stage</b> <b>left</b> Manche in Granville and headed south to the finish in Angers. Stage four took the race further south, between Saumur and Limoges, with the fifth stage crossing the elevated region of Massif Central to the finish at the Le Lioran mountain resort. Stage six headed to Montauban before {{the entrance to the}} Pyrenees in stage seven. This mountain range also hosted two further stages: a roller-coaster stage eight and the finish in Andorra in stage nine. The following three stages, 10 to 12, crossed the south of the country eastwards to Mont Ventoux. After an individual time trial, stage 14 took the race northwards through the Rhône Valley, which was followed by a stage that took the race into the Jura Mountains. Stage 16 ended with a finish in Bern, Switzerland. The next four stages took place in and around the Alps, before a long transfer took the Tour to the finish with the Champs-Élysées stage in Paris.|$|E

25|$|Two bureaucrats, first Bertrand (A) {{and then}} Morvan (B) enter a sixth floor {{apartment}} where they find Croker (C) standing centre stage {{in front of}} an open window {{with his back to the}} audience, clearly on the point of throwing himself out of it. A pair of identical tables, lamps and chairs are there waiting for them, <b>stage</b> <b>left</b> and stage right. The set is therefore symmetrical. The name Croker is an obvious pun on the euphemism, ‘to croak’ i.e. to die, and a name to which Beckett has shown some attachment.|$|E
25|$|Cellos {{are part}} of the {{standard}} symphony orchestra, which usually includes eight to twelve cello players. The cello section, in standard orchestral seating, is located on <b>stage</b> <b>left</b> (the audience's right) in the front, opposite the first violin section. However, some orchestras and conductors prefer switching the positioning of the viola and cello sections. The principal cellist is the section leader, determining bowings for the section in conjunction with other string principals, playing solos and leading entrances (when the section begins to play its part). Principal players always sit closest to the audience.|$|E
25|$|The Whiffler Theatre {{was built}} 1981 {{and was given}} to the people of Norwich by the local Newspaper Group, Eastern Daily Press. It is an open-air {{facility}} in Norwich Castle Gardens, with fixed-raked seating for up to 80 people and standing for another 30 on the balcony. The stage is brick-built and has its dressing-rooms set in a small building to <b>stage</b> <b>left.</b> The Whiffler mainly plays host to small Shakespeare productions. Sewell Barn Theatre is the smallest theatre in Norwich and has a seating capacity of just 100. The auditorium features raked seating on three sides of an open acting space. This unusual staging helps to draw the audience closely into the performance.|$|E

25|$|Fregoli took London by storm. He did quick-fire performances, impersonating Wagner, Rossini, Verdi and Paderewski {{one after}} another. He would exit <b>stage</b> <b>left</b> as a street {{musician}} and appear almost immediately stage right as a woman. Everybody - including the great actors and performers of the day, such as Dan Leno - {{wanted to see}} him, and his run was extended and extended, as was the seating in the theatre; not bad for someone who didn't even speak English. The general view of him was that, apart from his obvious abilities as a quick change artist he was - unlike his rivals - a consummate actor and a brilliant writer. He gave private performances for royalty and aristocrats (such as the Rothschilds, for whom he calmly explained all of his tricks). He inspired a host of imitators, male and female. Every theatre in London soon had its protean artist; even Biondi was there, performing at the same time. There were spoofers and parodists: journalists claimed tipsy theatregoers were demanding their money back upon discovering that all the performers they had just witnessed were actually just one man.|$|E

500|$|Biographer Taraborrelli commented, [...] "Madonna {{had more}} {{confidence}} in her stage presence, her music was showing a deeper maturity, her voice was fuller, and the show was expertly choreographed with complex numbers. J. D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun commented, [...] "I've seen the Springsteen stadium tour, I've seen Dylan and the [...] Dead, and I was at Live Aid. Out of all those shows, Madonna's {{is the only one}} I want to see again. You need a larger-than-life show if you want to come off in a stadium, and Madonna does. She's not that large physically, but she holds your attention." [...] Ann Ayers, assistant entertainment editor of USA Today felt that the show was high on glitz and low on emotional quotient. [...] "Madonna's going for a certain kind of show: a Broadway, show-biz, song-and-dance spectacle. In that context it's hard to make a connection with the audience, and I'd have to say that she didn't." [...] Peter Goddard from Toronto Star reviewed the concert in CNE Stadium and said, [...] "Madonna proved that she may be a lost girl in the roads of life, like her film, but she ain't lost when she is singing. Especially during songs like 'Papa Don't Preach', her vocal prowess was substantially notable." [...] Scott A Zamost and Elizabeth Snead, writing for Chicago Tribune, felt that [...] "For the most part, the premiere concert on Madonna's Who's That Girl tour was a success, an extravaganza of multiple videos, flashing lights and precision dancing. If the high-tech accoutrements and inferior sound system made it difficult to hear the singer, one hopes that will be refined as the tour continues across the United States. [...] As a dancer, Madonna is supreme on stage. Her trademark skip to a funky beat highlighted the constant acrobatics. One minute she was <b>stage</b> <b>left,</b> another minute stage right. She ran up a wide staircase center stage to party with her three back-up singers, then scooted down to the stage floor, swinging her hips, accompanied by other dancers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later on, the race's overall {{favorites}} took to {{the road}} not expressly for the stage win, but rather to iron out the race's overall standings.

Damiano Cunego and Gilberto Simoni, both noted as relatively weak time trialists, lost out on their chances for the podium because of Mazzoleni's ride and settled among themselves the battle for fourth place.
