It was also found that adding 10 percent of silica fume to the concrete mix may increase the compressive strength of the concrete by 25 percent without influencing its sensitivity to hot weather effects. Conversely, replacing superplasticizer by an equivalent quantity of retardant and plasticizer (based on equal concrete slump) reduced the compressive strength by about 10 percent, but the concrete became less sensitive to adverse climatic conditions.

To achieve an efficient global planarization for device node dimensions of less than 32 nm, a comprehensive understanding of the physical, chemical, and tribo-mechanical/chemical action at the interface between the pad and wafer in the presence of a slurry medium is essential. During the CMP process, some issues such as film delamination, scratching, dishing, erosion, and corrosion can generate defects which can adversely affect the yield and reliability. In this article, an overview of material removal mechanism of CMP process, investigation of the scratch formation behavior based on polishing process conditions and consumables, scratch formation mechanism and the scratch inspection tools were extensively reviewed. The advantages of adopting the filtration unit and the jet <b>spraying</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to reduce the scratch formation have been reviewed.

40|$|The {{physiological}} disorder tipburn remains a constant threat for growers of butterhead lettuce in greenhouses. In standard soil cultivation, tipburn is controlled reasonably well by using traditional growing methods, {{combined with the}} selection of tolerant cultivars. However, when applying novel growing techniques such as hydroponics, current practices to prevent tipburn show to be no longer sufficient. Therefore, a research project was started up, aiming at {{the development of a}} more rational tipburn prevention strategy. In the first year, tipburn occurrence was studied in successive soil-grown lettuce crops at two locations. Out of several environmental factors, which might induce tipburn according to literature, low nightly air humidity (RH.) appeared {{to be the most important}} one in commercial growing conditions. Several successive experiments with hydroponic lettuce (NFT) confirmed that maintaining RHn at a high level is an efficient measure to decrease tipburn occurrence. Whereas 60 to 100 % of the control plants was affected by tipburn, maintaining RHn above 95 % markedly reduced tipburn injury to 3 to 50 %, respectively. This effect was associated with an improved Ca transport to the leaf margins (1 cm zone) of young lettuce leaves and values higher than 2 - 3 g Ca kg(- 1) DM were obtained. The most efficient technique to decrease tipburn occurrence by raising RHn was the combination of water spraying underneath the gullies with nebulization above the plants.

A 2 mm rms beam spot with power deposition of over 18 KW presents challenging material and engineering solutions to this project. Given that the amount of heat transferred by radiation alone from the target to the horn is quite small, the primary mechanism is heat removal by forced convection in the annular space between the target and the horn. The key elements are the operating temperature of the target, the temperature of the cooling fluid and the heat generation rate in the volume of the target that needs to be removed. These working parameters establish the mass flow rate and velocity of the coolant necessary to remove the generated heat. Several cooling options were explored using a carbon-carbon target and aluminum horn. Detailed analysis, trade studies and simulations were performed for cooling the horn and target with gaseous helium as well as water. flowing in the annular space, the bulk of the heat generated in the conductor by the electric current is to be removed by the <b>spraying</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> through a set of optimally positioned jets.

40|$|Even {{under the}} best of {{slaughtering}} and processing conditions, beef carcasses will become naturally contaminated with some bacteria from the animal 2 ̆ 7 s hide, hair, hooves, and the abattoir environment. This contamination is mostly composed of bacteria which are harmless, but which can ultimately cause spoilage of the beef. The shelflife of raw beef is largely determined by the numbers and types of these bacteria. Since some bacterial contamination will always be present on beef, it is desirable to reduce these numbers to decrease the rate of spoilage, increase refrigerated shelflife, and further ensure the microbiological safety of raw beef before consumption. Any methods to reduce this bacterial contamination would greatly benefit the beef processing industry. Methods are currently used in the red meat industry to decontaminate the carcass. These include <b>spraying</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> or antimicrobial agents on the carcasses. Sprays include the use of dilute chlorine in the spray chill water or the application of dilute foodgrade acid sprays on the carcass before chilling. These acids are usually either acetic acid or lactic acid, both of which are commonly consumed food ingredients. Any methods which would enhance the antimicrobial effect of the acid or antimicrobial agent would be a significant improvement to beef production. We have developed the idea of applying food grade acids (acetic and lactic acids) into an edible gel coating which could be sprayed onto the carcass surface before entering the chilling chamber. Gel coatings have been shown to decrease the amount of moisture loss of the carcass. Incorporating the antimicrobial agent in an edible gel on the carcass would possibly help reduce moisture loss and simultaneously reduce the amount of spoilage bacteria. Any methods which decrease the amount of spoilage bacteria will also reduce the numbers of any pathogenic bacteria which may be present such as Listeria, Salmonella, and pathogenic Escherichia coli.

40|$|Summer water {{shortages}} {{have become a}} problem in Southeastern Massachusetts, communities in Vermont, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, {{and in a few}} areas in the Great Plains. This thesis proposes a conceptual system and outlines its feasibility for the production of large masses of ice in the winter within or in the vicinity of existing water reservoirs, thereby increasing their effective capacity without the need for an extensive or permanent water storage infrastructure. Eastern Massachusetts, for example, has an approximate average of 600 cold hours per winter when the temperature is below - 4 C. According to this concept, during these subfreezing temperature periods, ice would be produced by spraying water into the air and letting it freeze during free-fall as in the production of artificial snow. The pile of ice would then melt gradually during the spring and summer to provide a continuous supply of water. This study {{is the first step toward}} anticipated development of a pilot system and subsequent implementation. Major engineering issues of such an approach are: atomization and <b>spraying</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and heat transfer between the water drop and the air. A heat transfer model, which considers the drop size, free fall time, atmospheric temperature, humidity and nucleation, has been developed. The goal of the model is to enable the optimization of such an operation so as to minimize the required pumping power. Insulation techniques to preserve the ice for the summer are also outlined. Economic comparison with other alternatives for alleviation of {{water shortages}} such as water desalination was also made. Environmental evaluations consider potential disruption to nearby communities in the form of ice-making noise, icing and anticipated adversarial public perception of the concept. Other applications for winter-produced ice that may further improve the economic benefits of such an approach were also investigated. by Moshe Alamaro. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|Poultry {{housings}} with litter are a {{major contributor}} to fine dust emissions (PM 10 /PM 2. 5) in the Netherlands. Poultry producers are in need of dust mitigation options that are cost effective. Such an option could be provided by adequately designed water scrubbers. Catchment of dust particles by water droplets and deposition of dust particles on the surface of wetted packing material will lead to removal of dust from ventilation air. The aim of this research was to test water scrubbers under real poultry farm conditions. Prototypes of two water scrubber concepts were tested: prototype A was based on treating outlet air in a cross flow scrubbing setup. Synthetic packing material is continuously drained with a specified large volume of water, that is recirculated from a storage basin below. Prototype B was based on <b>spraying</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> by high pressure nozzles in an open treatment chamber, through which the ventilated air was led. A drip catcher was constructed at the outlet of this chamber to prevent loss of water. For prototype A an indicative measurement scheme was carried out on a poultry farm with non-productive raising pullets on cages. Four measurements based on 24 h sampling periods were carried out during which dust removal was measured by a gravimetrical method. Mean removal percentages for PM 2. 5 and PM 10 amounted 9 and 62 % respectively. The observed removal percentage for PM 10 was in accordance with an earlier theoretical assessment study. It is concluded that this prototype {{can be used as a}} basis to develop of this water scrubber for use in poultry production. Prototype B was tested on a broiler farm. First measurements based on gravimetrical methods showed negative removal results. To avoid biasing effects of high humidity on the results, subsequent gravimetrical measurements in the outlet air of the scrubber were carried out after heating and drying the outlet air to lower humidity levels. Accompanying particle counter measurement in particle size classes from 1 to 25 micrometer were carried out in both untreated and treated air. PM 10 removal performance was negative, and particle numbers especially increased in the smaller size classes. Inspection of outlet dust samples by electron microscopy indicated that formation of salt aerosols might provide an explanation for this increase. It is concluded in general that humidity effects on dust measurement methods and potential salt crystal formation may complicate dust removal performance of scrubbers and should be more deeply investigated...|$|E

The method applies far-reaching (long-distance) sprinkler installations for <b>spraying</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and formation of thick (more than 7 m for a day) masses of artificial firn. In winter the sprinkler allows freezing of both the monolithic ice and artificial firn. A practical implementation of this method is licensed and realized for construction of ice passages, bridges, and winter automobile roads. Testing of the method demonstrated that the artificial firn {{can be used for}} desalination and purification of polluted salt waters with high efficiency. That is stipulated by both, the high productivity of the method (about 1500 tons of artificial firn for a day at the air temperature of − 20 ° С, and low mineralization of the firn relative to initial salt water.   Winter sprinkling is carried out when mean daily air temperature drops below – 5 ∞ С. Estimating of productivity of the artificial firn and monolithic ice under present-day climatic conditions was made over the Russia’s territory. Analysis of the climate conditions for periods 2001 – 2010 and 1961 – 2000 have shown that reduction of the firn productivity changed from 5 - 10 % in Siberia up to 20 – 40 % in central and southern regions of the European Russia. At the present time, a potentially possible volume of the artificial firn freezing being produced in cold seasons changes from 500 thousand tons in northern areas of Yakutia down to 10 thousand in center of European Russia. Productivity of the monolithic ice freezing by a method of thin-layer water pouring is twice lower in central areas of Yakutia than on the Arctic seashores that is explained by differences in wind speeds. Potentially possible monolithic ice productivity made by means of thin-layer water pouring changes from 56 m of ice thickness in Northern Siberia down to 10 m in center of European Russia. The Northern Yakutia and the River Ob’ mouth are two areas of maximal productivity of this method. </p...|$|E
