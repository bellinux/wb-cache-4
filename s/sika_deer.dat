5|$|The main {{agricultural}} {{staple foods}} during the Han dynasty were foxtail millet, proso millet, rice (including glutinous rice), wheat, beans, and barley. Other food items included sorghum, taro, mallow, mustard plant, jujube, pear, plum (including Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), peach, apricot, and myrica. Chicken, duck, goose, beef, pork, rabbit, <b>sika</b> <b>deer,</b> turtle dove, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, crane, and {{various types of}} fish were commonly consumed meats.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} staple crops {{consumed}} during Han were wheat, barley, foxtail millet, proso millet, rice, and beans. Commonly eaten {{fruits and vegetables}} included chestnuts, pears, plums, peaches, melons, apricots, strawberries, red bayberries, jujubes, calabash, bamboo shoots, mustard plant and taro. Domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, cows, sheep, pigs, camels and dogs (various types were bred specifically for food, while most were used as pets). Turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes. Commonly hunted game, such as owl, pheasant, magpie, <b>sika</b> <b>deer,</b> and Chinese bamboo partridge were consumed. Seasonings included sugar, honey, salt and soy sauce. Beer and wine were regularly consumed.|$|E
5|$|In Siberia, {{the main}} prey species are Manchurian wapiti and wild boar (the two species {{comprising}} nearly 80% of the prey selected) followed by <b>sika</b> <b>deer,</b> moose, roe deer, and musk deer. Asiatic black bears and Ussuri brown bears may also {{fall prey to}} tigers, and they constitute up to 40.7% of the diet of Siberian tigers depending on local conditions and the bear populations. In Sumatra, prey include sambar deer, muntjac, wild boar, Malayan tapir and orangutan. In the former Caspian tiger's range, prey included saiga antelope, camels, Caucasian wisent, yak, and wild horses. Like many predators, tigers are opportunistic and may eat much smaller prey, such as monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, hares, porcupines, and fish.|$|E

25|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{occupation}} of Taiwan was to trade with mainland China, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia, attempting to monopolizing trade in East Asia. The main Taiwanese resources that they exported were sugar, <b>sika</b> deerskin, <b>deer</b> meat, antlers, rattan, and rice. By 1658, the company exported sugar to Persia, Japan, and Jakarta and had about 35 trading posts in Asia. Tayoan gained 25.6% profit, ranked second {{out of all of}} the Dutch trading posts, after Nagasaki, Japan. However, the profit was distributed to shareholders of the company, and not the local Taiwanese.|$|R
40|$|There {{are four}} species of wild deer present in upland Scotland: two native – red and roe deer and two non-native- <b>sika</b> and fallow <b>deer.</b> Deer are an {{important}} component and shaper of biodiversity in the Scottish uplands through positive, negative, direct and indirect impacts (Milne et al. 1998). For example, red deer help to maintain species richness through grazing grassland communities (Virtanen et al. 2002) and also provide carrion, thus supporting eagle populations (McGrady et al. 2004). On the other hand, deer can prevent regeneration of woodland through browsing of seedlings (Mitchell & Kirby 1990; Andrews et al. 2000) or trample sensitive flush and bog communities (MacDonald et al. 1998). Non-natives also pose a potential threat to biodiversity with interbreeding between <b>sika</b> and red <b>deer.</b> Red and roe deer are included on the Scottish Biodiversity Lis...|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} {{agricultural}} food staples during Han were wheat, barley, rice, foxtail millet, proso millet, and beans. People of the Han also consumed sorghum, Job's tears, taro, mallow, mustard green, melon, bottle gourd, bamboo shoot, {{the roots of}} lotus plants, and ginger. Some of the fruits the Han ate included the chestnut, jujube, pear, peach, plum (including the plum of Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), melon, apricot, red bayberry, and strawberry. The Han Chinese domesticated and ate chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, camels, cows, sheep, pigs, and dogs. The type of game animals hunted during the Han included rabbit, <b>sika</b> <b>deer,</b> turtle dove, goose, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, and cranes, while fish and turtles were taken from streams and lakes. Beer—which could be an unfermented malt drink with low alcohol content or a stronger brew fermented with yeast—was commonly consumed alongside meat, but virtually never consumed alongside grains such as rice. Wine was also regularly consumed.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, {{red deer}} and elk were {{considered}} to be one species, Cervus elaphus. However, mitochondrial DNA studies, conducted on hundreds of samples in 2004 from red deer and elk subspecies as well as other species of the Cervus deer family, strongly indicate that elk, or wapiti, should be a distinct species, namely Cervus canadensis. The previous classification had over a dozen subspecies under the C. elaphus species designation; DNA evidence concludes that elk are more closely related to Thorold's deer and even <b>sika</b> <b>deer</b> than they are to the red deer. Though elk and red deer can produce fertile offspring in captivity, geographic isolation between the species in the wild and differences in mating behaviors indicate that reproduction between them outside a controlled environment would be unlikely. However, the two species have freely inter-bred in New Zealand's Fiordland National Park, where the cross-bred animals have all but removed the pure elk blood from the area.|$|E
5|$|Lundy {{is home to}} {{an unusual}} range of mammals, almost all introduced, {{including}} a distinct breed of wild pony, the Lundy pony. Until recently, Lundy and the Shiant Isles in the Hebrides {{were the only two}} places in the UK where the black rat (Rattus rattus) could be found regularly. In the rest of the United Kingdom they have largely been replaced by brown rats except for occasional sightings in port towns and the Thames Estuary. It has since been eradicated on the island, {{in order to protect the}} nesting seabirds. Other species which have made the island their home include the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus), <b>Sika</b> <b>deer</b> (Cervus nippon), pygmy shrew (Sorex minutus) and feral goats (Capra aegagrus hircus). Unusually, 20% of the rabbits (Leporidae) on the island are melanistic compared with 4% which is typical in the UK. In mid-2006 the rabbit population was devastated by myxomatosis, leaving only 60 pairs from the previous 15–20,000 individuals. Soay sheep (Ovis aries) on the island have been shown to vary their behaviours according to nutritional requirements, the distribution of food and the risk of predation.|$|E
40|$|A partial DNA {{sequence}} of cytochrome b gene {{was used to}} identify the remains of endangered animals and species endemic to Taiwan. The conservation of animals species {{included in this study}} were: the formosan gem-faced civets, leopard cats, tigers, clouded leopards, lion, formosan muntjacs, formosan <b>sika</b> <b>deers,</b> formosan sambars, formosan serows, water buffalo, formosan pangolins and formosan macaques. The control species used included domestic cats, domestic dogs, domestic sheeps, domestic cattles, domestic pigs and humans. Heteroplasmy was detected in the formosan macaque, domestic pig and domestic cats. The frequencies of heteroplasmy in these animals were about 0. 25 % (1 in 402 bp). Sequences were aligned by Pileup program of GCG computer package, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method. The results of sequence comparison showed that the percentage range of sequence diversity in the same species was from 0. 25 to 2. 74 %, and that between the different species was from 5. 97 to 34. 83 %. The results of phylogenetic analysis showed that the genetic distance between the different species was from 6. 33 to 40. 59. Animals of the same species, both the endangered animal species and domestic animals, were clustered together in the neighbor-joining tree. Three unknown samples of animal remains were identified by this system. The partial {{sequence of}} cytochrome b gene adopted in this study proved to be usable for animal identification...|$|R
25|$|The natural {{distribution}} of sika on Taiwan {{was in the}} woodlands from sea level up to about 300 m elevation. <b>Sika,</b> like many <b>deer,</b> prefer areas of mixed forest, scrub, and open land. Under natural conditions the low-lying alluvial plain that stretches from present-day Taipei along the west coast almost to {{the southern tip of}} the island were prime deer habitat and natural populations would have been quite dense.|$|R
50|$|Majiabang people {{cultivated}} rice. At Caoxieshan and Chuodun, {{sites of}} the Majiabang culture, archaeologists excavated paddy fields, indicating the centrality of rice to the economy. In addition faunal remains excavated from Majiabang archaeological sites indicated that people had domesticated pigs. However, the remains of <b>sika</b> and roe <b>deer</b> have been found, showing that people were not totally reliant on agricultural production. Archaeological sites also bear evidence that Majiabang people produced jade ornaments.|$|R
25|$|The Japanese macaque {{has been}} {{observed}} attempting to mate with the <b>sika</b> <b>deer.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Japan, {{temperate}} deciduous forests rapidly spread {{onto the}} main island of Honshu and caused an adaption away from hunting megafauna (Naumann’s elephant and Yabe’s giant deer) to hunting the quicker <b>sika</b> <b>deer</b> and wild boar in dense forest. With this came {{a change in}} hunting technology, including a shift to smaller, triangular points for arrows. A study of the Jōmon people that lived on the Pacific coast of Honshu during the early Holocene shows that they were conducting individual dog burials and were probably using dogs as tools for hunting <b>sika</b> <b>deer</b> and wild boar, as hunters in Japan still do today.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sika</b> <b>deer</b> (Cervus nippon) were {{introduced}} to the park from Japan in 1865. Their population has increased considerably since then. Within the park they are found both on open upland areas and woodlands.|$|E
50|$|A deer-proof {{perimeter}} fence, {{in place}} for close to 100 years, and advanced pasture, cattle, and wildlife management practices {{have led to the}} development of a whitetail deer population and a broad diversity of plant and animal life. Axis, <b>sika</b> and fallow <b>deer</b> are also seen in strong numbers, as are blackbuck antelope and aoudad sheep. Bird watchers report seeing many varieties of sought-after birds, including the blackcap vireo, the golden-cheeked warbler, blue herons, and both bald and golden eagles. A sanctuary for the blackcap vireo is now established along one of the northern edges of the property.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} the development of population dynamics of cloven-hoofed game in the years 2005 - 2014 and various hunting grounds in the interest area. There are the largest population of roe deer and wild boar at the Horažďovice region. There are also other specific game species - mouflon, <b>sika</b> and fallow <b>deer.</b> The landscape at the Horažďovice region is cultural, widely used for agriculture {{and it is not}} varied for cloven-hoofed game. The gamekeeper's statistics are the most important source of data for evaluating the development of population dynamics of this game. There were analyzed the data for the spring fundamental groups, hunting and death in specific game species. The results are processed by using clear tables, graphs and primarily maps created by GIS method...|$|R
500|$|Marselisborg Forests and Riis Skov, has a {{long history}} for {{recreational}} activities of all kinds, including several restaurants, hotels and opportunities for green exercise. There are marked routes here for jogging, running and mountain biking and large events are hosted regularly. This includes running events, cycle racing and orienteering, the annual Classic Race Aarhus with historic racing cars and the biennial event Sculpture by the Sea, Aarhus, all attracting thousands of people. A new event will replace Sculpture by the Sea in 2017. Marselisborg Deer Park (Marselisborg Dyrehave) in Marselisborg Forests, comprises [...] of fenced woodland pastures with free-roaming <b>sika</b> and roe <b>deer.</b> Below the Moesgård Museum in the southern parts of the Marselisborg Forests, is a large historical landscape of pastures and woodlands, presenting different eras of Denmark's prehistory. Sections of the forest comprise trees and vegetation representing specific climatic epochs from the last Ice Age to the present. Dotted across the landscape are reconstructed Stone Age and Bronze Age graves, buildings from the Iron Age, Viking Age and medieval times, with grazing goats, sheep and horses in between.|$|R
25|$|Despite its {{poisonous}} properties, yew is very {{susceptible to}} browsing and bark stripping by deer, rabbits, hare, and domestic animals. It {{is one of}} the most grazing sensitive trees in the Killarney woodlands. <b>sika</b> <b>deer</b> have killed yews by scoring the trees with their antlers.|$|E
25|$|The past {{introduction}} of several exotic species {{to the park}} is an additional human influence on the area. These species have damaged the natural ecosystems of Killarney. The most notable of these species are the common rhododendron (Rhododendron ponticum), which has infested {{large areas of the}} National Park, and <b>sika</b> <b>deer,</b> which overgraze the woodland floor and pose a potential threat to the genetic integrity of the native red deer. Both rhododendron and <b>sika</b> <b>deer</b> can have an adverse effect on the native flora by inhibiting regeneration. A more recent, accidental, introduction is the American mink, which is now firmly established in the park alongside the native otter. Extinctions caused by humans include the wolf (Canis lupus L.) and the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos L.).|$|E
25|$|Prey {{species of}} Siberian tigers include Manchurian wapiti, Siberian musk deer, long-tailed goral, moose, Siberian roe deer, Manchurian <b>sika</b> <b>deer,</b> wild boar, even {{sometimes}} small size Asian black bear and Ussuri brown bear. Siberian tigers also take smaller species like hares, rabbits, pikas and salmon as food.|$|E
25|$|Red deer, once {{native to}} Wicklow but hunted to extinction, were reintroduced on the Powerscourt Estate in the 18th century. Japanese <b>sika</b> <b>deer</b> were also {{imported}} by the Powerscourt Estate and have interbred {{with the red}} deer. All deer found in the Wicklow Mountains are descended from the Powerscourt herd and are either <b>sika</b> <b>deer</b> or hybrid red-sika deer. Other mammals occurring include feral goats, mountain hares, badgers, stoats, otters, red squirrels, grey squirrels and bats. The Irish Elk is an extinct species of deer that lived in the Wicklow Mountains c. 11,000 years ago, remains of which were discovered in great quantities in Ballybetagh Bog near Glencullen. Wolves were also once native to the mountains but were hunted to extinction in Ireland: the last wolf in Wicklow was killed at Glendalough in 1710.|$|E
25|$|Deer House {{contains}} more mammals {{than any other}} house in the zoo, including axis deer (chital), blue bull (nilgai), fallow deer, Indian gazelle (chinkara), red deer, <b>sika</b> <b>deer,</b> the near-threatened species of blackbuck and mouflon as well as threatened species of hog deer, sambar and urial. It also houses red-necked wallabies.|$|E
25|$|Bird {{species that}} {{reside in the}} oak woods include blue tit, common chaffinch, goldcrest, European robin, and wren. Mammals include badger, fox, pine marten, red deer, <b>sika</b> <b>deer,</b> and red squirrel. Insects include many species of the {{parasitic}} gall wasp and the purple hairstreak butterfly, whose caterpillar is entirely dependent upon oak trees.|$|E
25|$|Historically, related deer {{species such}} as central Asian red deer, wapiti, Thorold's deer, and <b>sika</b> <b>deer</b> have been reared on deer farms in Central and Eastern Asia by Han Chinese, Turkic peoples, Tungusic peoples, Mongolians, and Koreans. In modern times, Western {{countries}} such as New Zealand and United States have taken to farming European red deer for similar purposes.|$|E
25|$|The Ainu hunted bear, Ezo deer (a {{subspecies}} of <b>sika</b> <b>deer),</b> rabbit, fox, raccoon dog, {{and other}} animals. Ezo deer were a particularly important food resource for the Ainu, as were salmon. They also hunted sea eagles such as white-tailed sea eagles, raven and other birds. The Ainu hunted eagles to obtain their tail feathers, which they used in {{trade with the}} Japanese.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a large}} {{population}} of non-native <b>sika</b> <b>deer</b> on the island. In the past the numbers have been higher than the island can sustain and have overgrazed. To try to limit damage to trees and other vegetation by deer, areas of the island have been fenced off to provide areas of undamaged woodland to allow other species such as red squirrels to thrive.|$|E
25|$|Fauna of County Kilkenny {{includes}} hedgehogs, otters, badgers, foxes, and bats such as Leisler's bats, Daubenton's bat, {{the brown}} long-eared bat {{and the common}} pipistrelle. There is also <b>sika</b> <b>deer,</b> fallow deer, stoat, red squirrel and pygmy shrew. The bird nesting period is from 1 March until 1 September. Woodlands, trees and hedgerows form a network of habitats, ecological ‘corridors’ essential for wildlife to flourish and move between habitats.|$|E
25|$|Pregnant hinds {{from the}} lowland areas {{frequently}} {{go to the}} mountains to give birth in early June. The National Park staff tags the calves. Although red deer and <b>sika</b> <b>deer</b> are capable of interbreeding, no cases of crossbreeding have been recorded in the park. High priority is given to maintaining the genetic purity of the native red deer herd. Red deer are fully protected by law, and their hunting is not permitted.|$|E
25|$|The faunal {{complex of}} the region is {{represented}} by a mixture of Asian and boreal life forms. The ungulate complex is represented by seven species, with Manchurian wapiti, Siberian roe deer, and wild boar being the most common throughout the Sikhote-Alin mountains but rare in higher altitude spruce-fir forests. <b>Sika</b> <b>deer</b> are restricted to the southern half of the Sikhote-Alin mountains. Siberian musk deer and Amur moose {{are associated with the}} conifer forests and are near the southern limits of their distribution in the central Sikhote-Alin mountains.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the trees}} in Re-enadinna wood are two hundred years old. There has been little {{regeneration}} of the yew trees in the wood. Overgrazing of the woodland floor by <b>sika</b> <b>deer</b> {{may be part of}} the reason for this, but small areas of the wood that have been fenced off since 1969 have experienced very little yew regeneration. The dense canopy created by the yew trees that lets very little sunlight through to the woodland floor may also prevent the growth of yew seedlings.|$|E
25|$|Rare Animal Range was a trail {{which focused}} on highly {{endangered}} species. Featured species included guanaco, Formosan <b>sika</b> <b>deer,</b> pied ruffed lemurs, and blue-eyed black lemurs. The exhibit also had duplicate enclosures for the zoo's Arabian oryx, blesbok, Père David's deer, and broad-snouted caiman {{as well as a}} large pond with a pair of small islands in the center which were home to a pair of golden-cheeked gibbons. Due to budget cuts and the unpopularity of many of the species, the zoo was forced to close the exhibit in 2009.|$|E
25|$|The main {{land use}} within {{the site is}} grazing by sheep. Deer grazing is also common. The woods in the park are {{currently}} severely overgrazed by <b>sika</b> <b>deer.</b> Grazing has caused damage to many terrestrial habitats, causing heath and blanket bogs to degrade and preventing woodland regeneration. In the upland areas erosion caused by grazing is exacerbated by the exposed nature of the terrain. Pressures from native grazers like red deer and Irish hare have increased since their main natural predators, the wolf and golden eagle, became extinct. Grazing and disturbance of vegetation greatly aids the spread of rhododendron.|$|E
25|$|Between January 1992 and November 1994, 11 tigers were captured, {{fitted with}} radio-collars and {{monitored}} {{for more than}} 15 months in the eastern slopes of the Sikhote-Alin mountain range. Results {{of this study indicate}} that their distribution is closely associated with distribution of wapiti, while distribution of wild boar was not such a strong predictor for tiger distribution. Although they prey on both Siberian roe deer and <b>sika</b> <b>deer,</b> overlap of these ungulates with tigers was low. Distribution of moose was poorly associated with tiger distribution. The distribution of preferred habitat of key prey species was an accurate predictor of tiger distribution.|$|E
25|$|Red {{deer are}} ruminants, {{characterized}} by a four-chambered stomach. Genetic evidence indicates the red deer as traditionally defined is a species group, rather than a single species, although it remains disputed as to exactly how many species the group includes. The closely related and slightly larger American elk or wapiti, native to North America and eastern parts of Asia, had been regarded as a subspecies of red deer, but recently it has been established as a distinct species. It is probable that the ancestor of all red deer, including wapiti, originated in central Asia and resembled <b>sika</b> <b>deer.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, {{deer are}} easily kept in captivity {{and there were}} a number of captive populations of C. n. taiouanus. In 1984 Taiwan’s Council of Agriculture funded the <b>Sika</b> <b>Deer</b> Reintroduction Project, based at Kenting National Park on the {{southern}} tip of the island. Twenty-two deer were transferred from the Taipei zoo to serve as a founder population. Over the next 10 years the deer were maintained in enclosures until their eventual release into the National Park in 1994. Altogether over 200 deer have been released and the current population, now spread beyond the park borders, is estimated to exceed 1000 individuals. Discussions regarding other possible reintroduction sites, including Yangmingshan National Park near Taipei, are ongoing.|$|E
