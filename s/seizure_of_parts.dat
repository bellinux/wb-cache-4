The {{conventional}} and innovative surface technologies {{are applied to}} sheet metal stamping dies {{in order to produce}} a composite material with properties unattainable in either the base or surface material.

For different types of die rings (with and without ceramic coatings) the punching forces were measured during deep-drawing process.

40|$|Good {{boundary}} lubrication is necessary during cold stamping of high-strength steel sheets to prevent die wear and <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>parts</b> {{owing to the}} high contact pressure. This study is aimed to improve the seizure resistance in a 1 -step combined process of deep drawing and ironing of ultra-high-strength steel cylindrical cups using a commercial lubricant containing SiO 2 nanoparticles with an uncoated die. In this study, the extreme pressure performance of the lubricant containing 0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 wt% of SiO 2 was first evaluated using a deep drawing process under increased blank holding forces. The optimum concentration of SiO 2 was determined, i. e. 2 wt%, based on successful drawing of cups having smooth surfaces under the highest holding force. Then, the ironing limits of the cups for the lubricants containing 0 and 2 wt% of SiO 2 respectively were investigated with the 1 -step combined process under increased ironing ratios. The experimental results showed that seizure was observed for the lubricant containing no nanoparticles at an ironing ratio of − 16. 7 %. However, no seizures were observed for ironing ratios up to 4. 2 % using the lubricant containing 2 wt% of SiO 2. The resistance to <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> the cup was significantly increased, leading {{to the formation of}} cylindrical cups having smooth surfaces and uniform side wall thickness...|$|R

The instrumentation-amplifier uses chopper-stabilization in a topology that achieves high input-impedance and rejects large electrode-offsets while operating at 1 V; the ADC employs power-gating for low energy-per-conversion while using static-biasing for comparator precision; the EEG feature extraction processor employs low-power hardware whose parameters are determined throug...|$|R
