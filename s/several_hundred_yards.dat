5|$|The JNA intervened {{directly}} against Croatia for {{the first}} time on 3 July 1991, driving Croatian forces out of Baranja, north of the city of Osijek, and out of Erdut, Aljmaš and Dalj east of Osijek. The advance was followed by intermittent fighting around Osijek, Vukovar and Vinkovci. At several points, JNA positions approached to within <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> of Osijek city limits.|$|E
5|$|Although the Falaise Gap was {{narrowed to}} a {{distance}} of <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards,</b> attacks and counter-attacks by two battle groups of the 1st Polish Armoured Division and the II SS Panzer Corps on Hill 262 (Mont Ormel) prevented the quick closing of the gap and thousands of German troops escaped. During two days of nearly continuous fighting, Polish forces using artillery barrages and close-quarter fighting, managed to hold off counter-attacks by seven German divisions. On 21 August, elements of the First Canadian Army relieved the Polish survivors and sealed the Falaise Pocket by linking up with the Third US Army. This led to the surrender and capture of the remaining units of the German 7th Army in the pocket.|$|E
5|$|The {{bombardment}} {{was scheduled}} to cease immediately before the assault companies deployed on Juno, but due to heavy seas, the landing was delayed by ten minutes, to 07:45 in Mike sector and 07:55 in Nan Sector. This was at a slightly higher tide, closer to the beach obstacles and mines. The LCTs carrying the field artillery were forced to adjust course to avoid landing too early; the LCTs carrying DD tanks were forced to break off their advance. The seas proved too rough to launch the DD tanks, so they were ordered to deploy from the LCTs <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> out from the beach.|$|E

25|$|In March 1954, Clancy saw {{firsthand the}} {{unfolding}} of the siege of the French Foreign Legion in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. He was assigned as an adviser and intelligence gatherer for the French forces positioned there. He evaded the closing ring of Việt Minh besiegers, escaping {{a few weeks before}} the French fortifications fell in May of the same year. Clancy's escape culminated under the cover of darkness with a painfully slow belly crawl across the flood plain which took him down to the banks of the Nam Yum River. The <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yard</b> crawl took a few hours to complete. The current of the river carried Lyall silently downstream to his freedom.|$|R
500|$|Although exact details {{regarding}} {{its foundation}} are unknown, {{it is believed}} that the Brudenell Social Club [...] was started by a group of businessmen who wanted to create an unaffiliated club, free from ties to political parties or any other kind of movement. These businessmen formed the Brudenell as a [...] "social and recreational club" [...] in November 1913, and initially intended to build a clubhouse <b>several</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>yards</b> from the eventual location, on land which would later be used to construct the Hyde Park Picture House. However, after this plan failed to come to fruition, a clubhouse was built at 33 Queen's Road, {{on the site of the}} present club's car park. Subsequently, this clubhouse opened on 2 December 1913.|$|R
5|$|The most {{destructive}} storm {{of the season}} {{can be traced back}} to near Saint Thomas at the end of September. By the beginning of October, it had tracked into the extreme southern Bay of Campeche. For several days, the strengthening storm battered ships as it turned northeastward through the Gulf of Mexico, with numerous vessels lost and many more damaged. The steamship Merchant began taking on water on October 3, and the next day she broke up after running aground <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> offshore. All but 8 of the 72 passengers were rescued on October 5. The brig Cuba and about 14 passengers were lost off Key West. During this period, many birds died over open waters after becoming trapped in the circulation of the slow-moving hurricane. The system delivered a glancing blow to Galveston, where the storm surge flooded streets and a few buildings were blown down.|$|E
25|$|The W1X {{engine powered}} the E.28/39 for taxi testing on 7 April 1941 near the factory in Gloucester, where {{it took to}} the air {{for two or three}} short hops of <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> at about six feet from the ground.|$|E
25|$|While {{commonly}} referred to as a seaside resort, Cleethorpes actually sits on the Humber estuary. The sea at Cleethorpes is actually the mouth of the Humber. This means that bathers are separated from the sea by <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> of sand at low tide.|$|E
5000|$|... "Big Bertha", an {{anti-aircraft}} gun, {{was erected}} {{at the top}} of the hill near City Road when World War II broke out in 1939. Although this gun proved useful in eliminating enemy aircraft, it also became an enemy target. A landmine was dropped within a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> of the gun on 19 November 1940, demolishing four houses in City Road and severely damaging several others, resulting in the deaths of 10 people and injuring many more. On 21 December 1940, a stray shell from the anti-aircraft gun fell down the chimney of the Boat Inn one mile away in Dudley Road East, Tividale, resulting in 13 deaths and dozens of injuries. On 12 August 1941, the Luftwaffe dropped a landmine <b>several</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>yards</b> from the gun in Birch Crescent, demolishing a pair of new semi-detached houses and severely damaging several others, leaving four people dead and several others injured. The gun was dismantled after the war ended in 1945, but several traces of it remain more than 70 years later.|$|R
25|$|Suburban {{systems of}} the sprawl type are also quite inefficient for cyclists or pedestrians, as the direct route is usually not {{available}} for them either. This encourages car trips even for distances as low as <b>several</b> <b>hundreds</b> of <b>yards</b> or meters (which may have become up to several miles or kilometers due to the road network). Improved sprawl systems, though retaining the car detours, possess cycle paths and footpaths connecting across {{the arms of the}} sprawl system, allowing a more direct route while still keeping the cars out of the residential and side streets.|$|R
5000|$|On June 22, Con Edison used {{non-toxic}} green dye and divers in {{the river}} to find {{the source of the}} leak. As a result, a 4 in hole was plugged. The utility continued to believe that the bulk of the spill went into the ground around the substation, and excavated and removed <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> cubic <b>yards</b> of soil from the area.

5|$|The Washington Huskies had outscored {{their opponents}} 20337 {{during the regular}} season, {{excluding}} the games against New York and Mississippi. Washington's running backs, George Wilson and Elmer Tesreau, led their offense during the season, each gaining <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> rushing <b>yards.</b> However, Tesreau was suffering from boils on his knee, and his coaches urged him to not play in the Rose Bowl. The Washington defense was considered superior to that of Navy, being much larger on average. Washington's defense had been very effective during the regular season, holding five teams scoreless and allowing more than ten points to be scored against them only once. Washington's special teams {{were considered to be}} average.|$|R

25|$|Blumenson {{describes}} how during {{the launch of}} Operation Cobra, tanks with the 2nd Infantry Division, supported by artillery, advanced without infantry for twenty minutes, covering <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> and knocking holes in hedgerows before returning to their starting position. The tanks and infantry then advanced rapidly together before the Germans were able to re-establish their defensive positions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> to {{the south}} of the main {{building}} is the other contributing resource, the guest cottage. It is a clapboard-sided frame two-story house on a stone foundation built into a hillside so that only one story is exposed on the north (rear) facade. Its gabled roof has overhanging eaves. A two-tiered porch runs along the entire south facade.|$|E
5|$|At about 18:00, {{the prisoners}} were divided into groups. Each group of 10 to 20 was loaded onto a truck and transported <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> metres (<b>yards)</b> from the {{building}} towards a wooded ravine. When the prisoners reached the previously prepared execution site, they were shot and buried in a mass grave using a bulldozer. After 15–20 minutes, the truck would return empty {{to pick up the}} next group. The final group of prisoners was executed just outside the farm building itself. By 22:00 that evening, all of the prisoners had been killed. Most sources place the number of victims at around 260. This figure has been used by ICTY prosecutors. Some estimates of the death toll go as high as 264. The Croatian authorities believe that the total figure stands at 261. The massacre was the most severe individual war crime committed in Europe since World War II until that point.|$|R
6000|$|... "Another {{instance}} is {{the attack}} upon Nilt fort. The place {{was one of}} great natural strength; the fort, which was a large one, faced the junction of three precipitous cliffs, <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> feet high, where a great ravine runs into the Hunza river. Owing {{to the nature of}} the ground, the fort could not be seen till the force was within three <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> of it; and fire could not be properly opened upon it until within two <b>hundred</b> and fifty <b>yards.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The house {{consists}} of a central stuccoed block of three floors with a basement divided into five bays, with a flanking pavilion of two stories in four bays, to either side connected by low flanking quadrant walls. In {{the centre of the}} front is a large classical pedimented portico fronted by four [...] Ionic columns. The flanking walls screen the service wings behind. The rear elevation [...] has on either side full-height semi-circular bays. The interior contains much Adam style decorative plasterwork, apparently the work of a certain Mr Powell [...] referred to in the invoice from the builder Bellman, and ornamental fittings. Robert Adam did much work for the Parkers at Saltram House near Plymouth between 1768–72 and 1779–82. The Poles are likely to have been guests at their neighbours at this time, but in any case as they also spent much time in London at their house in Bedford Square, they would have been familiar with Adam's work in London and elsewhere. The north-east pavilion contains a [...] theatre of circa 1900. The top floor housed the servants' quarters. The kitchens were originally situated in the left hand pavilion, later converted into a theatre. A large Palladian style stables block is situated around a semi-circular courtyard, <b>several</b> [...] <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> from the house, now converted into several separate residences. It had stabling for twelve horses and accommodation for grooms.|$|R
25|$|Virginia Law {{receives}} no {{funding from}} the state; instead the school depends upon the generosity of private donors, its substantial endowment (US $ 495 million) and student tuition payments. In 1995-1997, the Law School used entirely donated funds to renovate and expand its buildings on the University's North Grounds to include the former facilities of the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration which built a new campus <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> away.|$|E
25|$|The {{group that}} landed at Hardelot {{penetrated}} <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> inland {{and returned to}} its boat without meeting any Germans.

It encountered a German patrol and in the short exchange of fire that followed, one man was slightly wounded.|$|E
25|$|Zug Island is {{a heavily}} industrialized island {{within the city}} of River Rouge at the {{southern}} city limits of Detroit in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is located where {{the mouth of the}} River Rouge spills into the Detroit River. Zug Island is not a natural island in the river; it was formed when a shipping canal was dug along the southwestern side of the island, allowing ships to bypass <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> of twisting waterway near the mouth of the natural course of the lowest portions of the River Rouge.|$|E
6000|$|Naturally, the land-revenue is {{the most}} {{interesting}} thing in Marwar from an administrative point of view. The basis of it is a tank {{about the size of a}} swimming-bath, with a catchment of <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> square <b>yards,</b> draining through leeped channels. When God sends the rain, the people of the village drink from the tank. When the rains fail, as they failed this year, they take to their wells, which are brackish and breed guinea-worm. For these reasons the revenue, like the Republic of San Domingo, is never alike for two years running. There are no canal questions to harry the authorities; but the fluctuations are enormous. Under the Aravalis the soil is good: further north they grow millet and pasture cattle, though, said a Revenue Officer cheerfully, [...] "God knows what the brutes find to eat." [...] Apropos of irrigation, the one canal deserves special mention, as showing how George Stephenson came to Jodhpur and astonished the inhabitants. Six miles from the city proper lies the Balsaman Sagar, a great tank. In the hot weather, when the city tanks ran out or stank, it was the pleasant duty of the women to tramp twelve miles at the end of the day's work to fill their lotahs. In the hot weather Jodhpur is--let a simile suffice. Sukkur in June would be Simla to Jodhpur.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} the river, from {{the outer edge of}} the cove, was about a <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> wide. The boys had {{frequently}} swum across, so Snap's proposal to go over was nothing unusual. Side by side the boys started out and took their time. They did not attempt to stem the current but allowed it to carry them down the river for <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> feet. They landed where there was an old orchard, backed up by a large strawberry patch.|$|R

By this time less than one half of the train had made it safely through the Pass. Jones promised reinforcements from the 6th Virginia Cavalry and Emack ordered his men to hold their ground and conserve their ammunition. Meanwhile, elements of Jones's cavalry attacked Huey's brigade in the rear of Kilpatrick's column.|$|E
25|$|On December 28, 1863, Dodd {{visited the}} Provost Marshal's office at St. John's College (<b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> {{southwest}} of the arsenal) and had no trouble obtaining a pass through Union lines to rejoin his family in Camden. Dodd left Little Rock the next day. As he left Union territory, the guard tore up Dodd's pass since {{he would no longer}} need it now that he was in Confederate land. He went to spend the night with his uncle, Washington Dodd, on the Middle Hot Springs Road southwest of Little Rock. The next day Dodd traveled through the woods and found himself back behind Union lines.|$|E
25|$|A {{stand-off}} {{began on}} 9 April between Bainbridge, Halyburton, and the pirates' lifeboat from Maersk Alabama, {{on which they}} held Phillips hostage. The lifeboat itself was covered and contained plenty {{of food and water}} but lacked basic comforts, including a toilet or ventilation. Bainbridge was equipped with a ScanEagle UAV and Rigid-hulled inflatable boats. Both vessels stayed <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> away, out of the pirates' range of fire. A P-3 Orion surveillance aircraft secured aerial footage and reconnaissance. Radio communication between the two ships was established. Four foreign vessels held by pirates headed towards the scene. A total of 54 hostages were on two of the ships, citizens of China, Germany, Russia, the Philippines, Tuvalu, Indonesia, and Taiwan.|$|E

40|$|Profile {{surveys were}} made across 80 {{selected}} Hawaiian beach and nearshore environments at quarterly intervals for one and one-half years during 1962 - 63. Also 70 additional beaches were measured at less frequent intervals. Using these profiles, supplemented by water-jet borings and measurements from aerial photographs, the total sand volume {{of each of}} the major Hawaiian beach systems was computed. The seasonal fluctuations of these volumes were also computed and related to the wave and littoral current regimes. The volume of littoral sand was found to be considerably less than the volume for many sandy continental areas. About 4. 0 X 10 ^ 7 cu yd of sand is held in beach reservoirs on the seven major island s of the Hawaiian group; most is concentrated on Kauai (1. 4 X 10 ^ 7 cu yd) and on Oahu (1. 0 X 10 ^ 7 cu yd). Individual beaches containing more than 1 X 10 ^ 6 cu yd are Keawanui on Niihau; Hanalei, Polihale-Barking Sands, and Kekaha-Nohili-Bonham on Kauai; Bellows-Waimanalo on Oahu; and Papohaku on Molokai. The beaches on the island of Hawaii hold the smallest volumes of sand. Seasonal rates of erosion and accretion of beach sand reservoirs were found to be generally on the order of a few tens of cubic yards of sand per linear yard of beach per month. The higher rates were on exposed north and west coasts, with a maximum rate of <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> cubic <b>yards</b> of sand per linear yard of beach per month recorded for Lumahai Beach, Kauai during 1962 - 63...|$|R
