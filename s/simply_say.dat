5|$|Several {{historians have}} {{attempted}} to establish the dates of Kanhopatra's life and death. One estimate places her life circa 1428 CE by relating her to a Bahamani king of Bidar who {{is often associated with}} the Kanhopatra story—although in most accounts, that king is never explicitly named. Pawar estimates that she died in 1480. Others suggest dates of 1448, 1468 or 1470, or <b>simply</b> <b>say</b> that she lived in the 15th century—or in rare instances, the 13th or 16th century. According to Zelliot, she was a contemporary of saint-poets Chokhamela (14th century) and Namadeva (c.1270-c.1350).|$|E

25|$|If X = Y then we <b>simply</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} binary {{relation}} is over X, {{or that it}} is an endorelation over X. In computer science, such a relation is also called a homogeneous (binary) relation. Some types of endorelations are widely studied in graph theory, where they are known as simple directed graphs permitting loops.|$|E

25|$|The {{nature of}} the {{individual}} nonempty sets in the collection may {{make it possible to}} avoid the axiom of choice even for certain infinite collections. For example, suppose that each member of the collection X is a nonempty subset of the natural numbers. Every such subset has a smallest element, so to specify our choice function we can <b>simply</b> <b>say</b> that it maps each set to the least element of that set. This gives us a definite choice of an element from each set, and makes it unnecessary to apply the axiom of choice.|$|E
25|$|Following {{decades of}} coming second in {{television}} ratings to Nine News Melbourne and Ten Eyewitness News Melbourne (previously Ten Evening News, Ten News: First at Five, Ten News at Five and Ten News at Six), Seven News Melbourne {{went into a}} tight contest to win the ratings battle in 2005. Seven News overtook the rival Nine bulletin in the ratings in 2007. This was subsequently followed {{by a series of}} advertisements and promos which have touted Seven News Melbourne as Melbourne's New #1 and Nine altering their promotions to <b>simply</b> <b>say</b> Melbourne's Best News - a throwback to the 1980s when National Nine News Melbourne was being beaten in the ratings by ATV-10's Ten Eyewitness News. As of 2011, Seven has lost its ratings lead at 6 pm to 9 pm.|$|E
25|$|Simply put, this {{legislation}} ensures that we respect our obligations under Geneva, recognizes the President's constitutional authority to interpret treaties, and brings accountability and transparency {{to the process}} of interpretation by ensuring that the executive's interpretation is made public. I would note that there has been opposition to {{this legislation}} from some quarters, including the New York Times editorial page. Without getting into a point-by-point rebuttal here on the floor, I would <b>simply</b> <b>say</b> that I have been reading the Congressional Record trying to find the bill that page so vociferously denounced. The hyperbolic attack is aimed not at any bill this body is today debating, nor even at the Administration's original position. I can only presume that some would prefer that Congress simply ignore the Hamdan decision, and pass no legislation at all. That, I suggest to my colleagues, would be a travesty.|$|E

In an interview, Farmer deplored the censorship, saying: [...] " [...] has shocked many people. I find it pretty stupid.

2500|$|Some Christians {{claim that}} there are many other {{passages}} that speak about the same New Covenant without using this exact wording.

2500|$|Incompleteness. Traditional logic {{requires}} additional axioms {{and constraints}} {{to deal with}} the real world as opposed to the world of mathematics. Also, it is often useful to associate degrees of confidence with a statement. I.e., not <b>simply</b> <b>say</b> [...] "Socrates is Human" [...] but rather [...] "Socrates is Human with confidence 50%". This was one of the early innovations from expert systems research which migrated to some commercial tools, the ability to associate certainty factors with rules and conclusions. Later research in this area is known as Fuzzy Logic.|$|E

[...] The only constant hobby is Harold's talent for preparing home-cooked meals for Clyde and Howard, particularly frittatas. The McBrides are foils to Lincoln Loud's parents, who are less worrisome and more sensible despite having eleven children instead of one.|$|E
