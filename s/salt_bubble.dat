40|$|The inﬂuence of gas {{velocity}} (3. 5, 10, and 18 mm/s), salt type (NaCl, NaF, NaBr, NaI and CsCl) and salt concentration (0. 001 – 3 M) on bubble coalescence {{in a small}} bubble column were studied. The bubble coalescence {{was determined by the}} relative change in the measured light intensities passing through the salt solutions and clean deionised water. It was shown that the transition <b>salt</b> concentration for <b>bubble</b> coalescence inhibition (determined at 50 % of bubble coalescence) of all investigated salts decreases with increasing superﬁcial {{gas velocity}}. The difference in the transition concentration between NaCl, NaF, NaBr and CsCl does not signiﬁcantly change with the gas velocity. However that difference between NaI and the other salts signiﬁcantly decreases with increasing the gas velocity. The gas holdup signiﬁcantly increases with NaCl, NaF, NaBr and CsCl concentrations but does not signiﬁcantly change with NaI concentration. These new results imply that the transition <b>salt</b> concentration for <b>bubble</b> coalescence and gas holdup depend not only on the salt properties (i. e. the ion type and their combination) as previously reported, but also on the hydrodynamic conditions...|$|R

A suspension consisting of millimeter-sized bubbles in water containing some dissolved <b>salt,</b> which prevents <b>bubbles</b> from coalescing, will be sheared in a Couette cylindrical cell. Rotation of the outer cylinder will produce centrifugal force which will tend to accumulate the bubbles near the inner wall. The shearing will enhance collisions among bubbles creating thereby bubble phase pressure that will resist the tendency of the bubbles to accumulate near the inner wall. The bubble volume fraction and velocity profiles will be measured and compared with the theoretical predictions.

40|$|In the {{chemical}} ZnO deposition on Pd-catalyzed glass from aqueous dimethylamineborane (DMAB) solutions, effects of counteranions (NO 3 -, Cl−, ClO 4 -, and SO 4 2 -) and dissolved oxygen (DO) on the hydrolysis behavior of Zn 2 + {{and the growth}} regime of ZnO were studied using sodium and zinc <b>salt</b> solutions <b>bubbled</b> with O 2, air, or Ar gas. The interaction of the counteranions with H+ and Pd as well as Zn 2 + was suggested as an important factor for {{the chemical}} ZnO deposition, and {{it was found that}} only NO 3 - can raise the pH of a DMAB solution without DO, affording the continuous ZnO growth. Dissolved oxygen accelerated the ZnO nucleation process on the Pd and had less influence comparable to NO 3 - on the subsequent growth on the ZnO surface. The ZnO films deposited from Zn(NO 3) 2 –DMAB solutions bubbled with O 2, air, or Ar gas were characterized with an X-ray diffractometer, field emission scanning electron microscope, UV-visible spectrophotometer, and Hall coefficient analyzer. The Ar-bubbled solution gave superior ZnO films in terms of crystallinity, growth orientation, surface morphology, and electrical conductivity due to the relatively moderate crystal nucleation compared to in the presence of DO...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the continued development of micro optical phase detection instrumentation capable of measuring void fraction, interfacial area density, interfacial velocity and bubble sizes and their application to measurements {{in a high}} speed boundary layer. The instrumentation consists of micro sized sapphire tipped probes tailored to measure in the two-phase flow of air bubbles in water. Probe tips with geometries intended to maximize field life while minimizing intrusiveness were designed, fabricated and characterized. The characterization revealed that the active region of a probe tip can go beyond the highly sensitive 45 degree tip. Controlling the active length of the tips can be achieved {{through a combination of}} taper angles and 45 degree tip size, with larger tips having shorter active lengths. The full scale bubbly flow measurements were performed on a 6 m flat bottom survey boat. The aforementioned quantities were measured on bubbles naturally entrained at the bow of the boat. Probes were positioned at the bow of the boat, near the entrainment region and at the stern where the bubbles exit after having interacted with the high shear turbulent boundary layer. Experiments were conducted in fresh water, at the Coralville Lake, IA, and salt water, at the St. Andrews Bay and Gulf Coast near Panama City, FL. The results indicate that the bubbles interact significantly with the boundary layer. At low speeds, in fresh water, bubble accumulation and coalescence is evident by the presence of large bubbles at the stern. At high speeds, in both fresh and <b>salt</b> water, <b>bubble</b> breakup dominates and very small bubbles are produced near the hull of the boat. It was observed that salt water inhibits coalescence, even at low boat speeds. Void fraction was seen to increase with boat speeds above 10 knots and peaks near the wall. Bubble velocities show slip with the wall at all speeds and exhibit large RMS fluctuations, increasing near the wall...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether maturation alters endothelium-dependent responses in porcine pulmonary arteries, rings, {{with and without}} endothelium, of small pulmonary arteries taken from piglets of 3, 10, and 30 d of age were suspended in organ chambers filled with buffered <b>salt</b> solution, <b>bubbled</b> with 95 % O 2 - 5 % CO 2, and maintained at 37 °C. These studies were performed {{in the presence of}} indomethacin (10 - 5 M) to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. In rings without endothelium, potassium chloride (10 - 2 to 8. 5 x 10 - 2 M) and histamine (10 - 9 to 10 - 5 M) caused concentration-dependent contractions. When normalized to maximal contractions achieved to each agonist, the concentration-effect curves to potassium chloride and histamine in rings without endothelium were similar at each age. Rings with endothelium showed a progressive shift {{to the right of the}} concentration-effect curve to histamine, possibly secondary to an increase in the basal release of, or responsiveness to, the endothelium-derived relaxing factor with maturation. Relaxations to sodium nitroprusside (10 - 9 to 10 - 5 M) were unaffected by age. In precontracted rings, acetylcholine (10 - 9 to 10 - 6 M), bradykinin (10 - 10 to 10 - 6 M), and the calcium ionophore A 23187 (10 - 9 to 10 - 6 M) caused relaxations in rings with endothelium, but not in those without endothelium, which were greater at 10 and 30 d compared to 3 d; further augmentation at 30 d compared to 10 d was not observed. In rings without endothelium, changes in the responsiveness to nitric oxide (10 - 9 to 10 - 5 M), one of the proposed endothelium-derived relaxing factors, with age were comparable to those observed with endothelium-dependent relaxing agents. These studies demonstrate that endothelium-dependent relaxations increase with age, possibly due to changes in sensitivity of the smooth muscle to the endothelium-derived relaxing factor. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Some <b>salts</b> can inhibit <b>bubble</b> {{coalescence}} above {{a critical}} concentration. The initial models for prediciting the critical salt concentrations were developed {{based on the}} effects of the Gibbs-Marangoni stress and either the London-van der Waals or Casimir-van der Waals attraction on the drainage and rupture of thin liquid films between bubbles. The later models considered only the Gibbs-Marangoni stress and discarded the van der Waals forces. Here, we present new experimental results of film drainage experiments using halide salts to show that both the Gibbs-Marangoni stress and colloidal forces are equally important. Specifically, our experimental results show that if only the Gibbs-Marangoni stress is considered, the predicted film rupture thickness can differ from the experimental results by as much as 92 – 156 %. The initial models also significantly under-predict the experimental results for the critical salt concentration and film rupture thickness. To examine these deficiencies we use a new mathematical model recently developed to obtain both the salt concentration and rupture thickness of film concurrently, thus removing the inherent ambiguity of the previous models that need the rupture thickness to calculate the salt concentration or vice versa. Indeed, the new modelling approach requires a nonDLVO attractive force together with the Casimir-van der Waals attraction and the Gibbs-Marangoni stress to predict the experimental results for both the salt concentration and rupture thickness of film, which are critical to understanding <b>bubble</b> coalescence in <b>salt</b> solutions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMolten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) {{is a new}} fast nuclear reactor, {{which is}} at present under memoranda and {{understanding}} (MOU) from Generation IV International Forum (GIF). In the MSFR concept, fissile material dissolved in molten fluoride salts serves as a liquid fuel in a primary loop. One {{of the issues that}} need to be addressed is the development of an extraction technique of fission products from the fuel [1]. The technique addressed here is based on the injection of helium bubbles in the molten salt in order to absorb fission products by liquid/gas mass transfer. Solid particles are expected to adsorb at bubble surfaces as well. Taking into account that molten salts, as a continuous phase, are electrically conductive, an externally applied magnetic field offers opportunities for a contactless flow control. In addition, the jump in electrical conductivities between molten <b>salts</b> and contaminated <b>bubbles</b> is expected to enhance electromagnetic separation of gaseous phase after ad/absorption processes. To address this online extraction, it is important to simulate the dynamics of bubbles flowing in a molten salt, taking into account magnetohydrodynamics of the liquid phase. Numerical simulations of the process are performed with a CFD code based on finite volume method (ANSYS FLUENT). Bubble surfaces are captured by Volume of Fluid (VOF) strategy while the electric current densities are calculated in the carrier phase by making use of the Magnetic Induction Method. In this way, we are able to describe bubble deformation due to the hydrodynamic forces and the Lorentz force, which makes the fluid to circulate mainly in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field. We investigate the transient regime required to get the terminal bubble velocity. The way the magnetic field is able to change the streamlines around a bubble is particularly investigated while varying the Hartmann number...|$|R

40|$|The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) is {{developing}} a novel process to produce titanium metal {{at a lower cost}} than the current Kroll process used commercially. The technology initiated by the CSIR will benefit South Africa in achieving the long-term goal of establishing a competitive titanium metal industry. A bubble column reactor is one of the suitable reactors that were considered for the production of titanium metal. This reactor will be operated with a molten <b>salt</b> medium. <b>Bubble</b> columns are widely used in various fields of process engineering, such as oxidation, hydrogenation, fermentation, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis and waste water treatment. The advantages of these reactors over other multiphase reactors are simple construction, good mass and heat transfer, absence of moving parts and low operating costs. High heat transfer is important in reactors when high thermal duties are required. An appropriate measurement of the heat transfer coefficient is of primary importance for designing reactors that are highly exothermic or endothermic. An experimental test facility to measure wall heat transfer coefficients was constructed and operated. The experimental setup was operated with tap water, heat transfer oil 32 and lithium chloride–potassium chloride (LiCl–KCl) eutectic by bubbling argon gas through the liquids. The column was operated at a temperature of 40 oC for the water experiments, at 75, 103 and 170 oC for the heat transfer oil experiments, and at 450 oC for the molten salt experiments. All the experiments were run at superficial gas velocities in the range of 0. 006 to 0. 05 m/s. Three heating tapes, each connected to a corresponding variable AC voltage controller, were used to heat the column media. Heat transfer coefficients were determined by inducing a known heat flux through the column wall and measuring the temperature difference between the wall and the reactor contents. In order to balance the system, heat was removed by cooling water flowing through a copper tube {{on the inside of the}} column. Temperature differences between the column wall and the liquid were measured at five axial locations. A mechanistic model for estimating the kinematic turbulent viscosity and dispersion coefficient was developed from a mechanism of momentum exchange between large circulation cells. By analogy between heat and momentum transfer, these circulation cells also transfer heat from the wall to the liquid. There were some challenges when operating the bubble column with molten salt due to leakages on the welds and aggressive corrosion of the column. The experimental results were obtained when operating the column with water and heat transfer oil. It was found that the heat transfer coefficient increases with superficial gas velocity. The values of the heat transfer coefficient for the argon–water system were higher than those for the argon–heat transfer oil system. The heat transfer coefficients were also found to increase with an increase in temperature. Gas holdup increased with the superficial gas velocity. It was found that the estimated axial dispersion coefficients are within the range of those reported in the literature and the ratios of dispersion coefficients are in agreement with those in the literature. The estimated kinematic turbulent viscosities were comparable with those in the literature. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015. tm 2015 Chemical EngineeringMEngUnrestricte...|$|R
60|$|It was my task {{each day}} to visit the various {{families}} assembled in our town, and when the weather permitted, I was glad to prolong my ride, and to muse in solitude over every changeful appearance of our destiny, endeavouring to gather lessons for the future {{from the experience of}} the past. The impatience with which, while in society, the ills that afflicted my species inspired me, were softened by loneliness, when individual suffering was merged in the general calamity, strange to say, less afflicting to contemplate. Thus often, pushing my way with difficulty through the narrow snow-blocked town, I crossed the bridge and passed through Eton. No youthful congregation of gallant-hearted boys thronged the portal of the college; sad silence pervaded the busy school-room and noisy playground. I extended my ride towards Salt Hill, on every side impeded by the snow. Were those the fertile fields I loved--was that the interchange of gentle upland and cultivated dale, once covered with waving corn, diversified by stately trees, watered by the meandering Thames? One sheet of white covered it, while bitter recollection told me that cold as the winter-clothed earth, were the hearts of the inhabitants. I met troops of horses, herds of cattle, flocks of sheep, wandering at will; here throwing down a hay-rick, and nestling from cold in its heart, which afforded them shelter and food--there having taken possession of a vacant cottage. Once on a frosty day, pushed on by restless unsatisfying reflections, I sought a favourite haunt, a little wood not far distant from <b>Salt</b> Hill. A <b>bubbling</b> spring prattles over stones on one side, and a plantation of a few elms and beeches, hardly deserve, and yet continue the name of wood. This spot had for me peculiar charms. It had been a favourite resort of Adrian; it was secluded; and he often said that in boyhood, his happiest hours were spent here; having escaped the stately bondage of his mother, he sat on the rough hewn steps that led to the spring, now reading a favourite book, now musing, with speculation beyond his years, on the still unravelled skein of morals or metaphysics. A melancholy foreboding assured me that I should never see this place more; so with careful thought, I noted each tree, every winding of the streamlet and irregularity of the soil, that I might better call up its idea in absence. A robin red-breast dropt from the frosty branches of the trees, upon the congealed rivulet; its panting breast and half-closed eyes shewed that it was dying: a hawk appeared in the air; sudden fear seized the little creature; it exerted its last strength, throwing itself on its back, raising its talons in impotent defence against its powerful enemy. I took it up and placed it in my breast. I fed it with a few crumbs from a biscuit; by degrees it revived; its warm fluttering heart beat against me; I cannot tell why I detail this trifling incident--but the scene is still before me; the snow-clad fields seen through the silvered trunks of the beeches,--the brook, in days of happiness alive with sparkling waters, now choked by ice--the leafless trees fantastically dressed in hoar frost--the shapes of summer leaves imaged by winter's frozen hand on the hard ground--the dusky sky, drear cold, and unbroken silence--while close in my bosom, my feathered nursling lay warm, and safe, speaking its content with a light chirp-- painful reflections thronged, stirring my brain with wild commotion--cold and death-like as the snowy fields was all earth--misery-stricken the life-tide of the inhabitants--why should I oppose the cataract of destruction that swept us away?--why string my nerves and renew my wearied efforts--ah, why? But that my firm courage and cheerful exertions might shelter the dear mate, whom I chose in the spring of my life; though the throbbings of my heart be replete with pain, though my hopes for the future are chill, still while your dear head, my gentlest love, can repose in peace on that heart, and while you derive from its fostering care, comfort, and hope, my struggles shall not cease,--I will not call myself altogether vanquished.|$|R
