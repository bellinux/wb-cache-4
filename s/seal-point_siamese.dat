50|$|Urban legend {{says that}} Bobtails {{are the result}} of a {{crossbreeding}} between a domestic tabby cat and a wild bobcat. The unusual tail is actually the result of a random spontaneous genetic mutation within the domestic cat population, and {{may be related to the}} Manx gene, which is also dominant. Yodie, a short-tailed brown tabby male, was mated with a <b>seal-point</b> <b>Siamese</b> female to create the American Bobtail's original bloodline. Most of the early bloodlines have died out.|$|E
5000|$|Tao: Tao is a slender, <b>seal-point,</b> old style <b>Siamese</b> {{cat with}} {{sapphire}} eyes. An element of {{humor in the}} book is that Tao, like Bodger, despises other cats, and the two once shared many adventures terrorizing the other felines in their neighborhood; when they encounter other domesticated cats in their travels, Tao often fights them, successfully. Tao is able to open most doors, a help to the dogs in several situations. Tao is a tireless, bold, and loyal animal. Tao is probably the best equipped of the three to survive in the wilderness, and has no difficulty surviving on his own when separated from the two dogs; despite this, he spends all his time seeking to rejoin them, a testament to the bond between the animals. The cat is an independent and natural hunter, catching small birds for the group. When Tao is separated from them, the dogs fare more poorly without Tao than Tao does without them. Therefore, Tao is crucial to the dogs' survival.|$|R
