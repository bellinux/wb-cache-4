2500|$|The {{half-life}} of glyphosate in soil ranges between 2 and 197 days; {{a typical}} field half-life of 47 days has been suggested. <b>Soil</b> <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> affect glyphosate's persistence in soil. The median half-life of glyphosate in water varies {{from a few}} to 91 days. At a site in Texas, half-life was as little as three days. A site in Iowa had a half-life of 141 days. The glyphosate metabolite AMPA {{has been found in}} Swedish forest soils up to two years after a glyphosate application. In this case, the persistence of AMPA was attributed to the soil being frozen for most of the year. Glyphosate adsorption to soil, and later release from soil, varies depending on the kind of soil. Glyphosate is generally less persistent in water than in soil, with 12- to 60-day persistence observed in Canadian ponds, although persistence of over a year has been recorded in the sediments of American ponds.

5000|$|The {{two general}} {{patterns}} {{for the growth}} of bamboo are [...] "clumping" [...] (sympodial) and [...] "running" [...] (monopodial).

[...] "Running" [...] bamboos, though, need to be controlled during cultivation because of their potential for aggressive behavior. They spread mainly through their roots and/or rhizomes, which can spread widely underground and send up new culms to break through the surface.

50|$|Coffee {{production}} in the country began in 1779 in the Meseta Central which had ideal <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> for coffee plantations. Coffea arabica first imported to Europe through Arabia, whence it takes its name, {{was introduced to the}} country directly from Ethiopia. In the nineteenth century, the Costa Rican government strongly encouraged coffee production, and the industry fundamentally transformed a colonial regime and village economy built on direct extraction by a city-based elite towards organized production for export on a larger scale. The government offered farmers plots of land for anybody who wanted to harvest the plants. The coffee plantation system in the country therefore developed in the nineteenth century largely as result of the government's open policy, although the problem with coffee barons did play a role in internal differentiation and inequality in growth. Soon coffee became a major source of revenue surpassing cacao, tobacco, and sugar production as early as 1829.Exports across the border to Panama were not interrupted when Costa Rica joined other Central American provinces in 1821 in a joint declaration of independence from Spain. In 1832, Costa Rica, at the time a state in the Federal Republic of Central America, began exporting coffee to Chile where it was re-bagged and shipped to England under the brand of “Café Chileno de Valparaíso”. In 1843, a shipment was sent directly to the United Kingdom by the Guernseyman William Le Lacheur, captain of the English ship, The Monarch, who had seen the potential of directly cooperating with the Costa Ricans. He sent several hundred-pound bags and following this the British developed an interest in the country. They invested heavily in the Costa Rican coffee industry, becoming the principal customer for exports until World War II. Growers and traders of the coffee industry transformed the Costa Rican economy, and contributed to modernization in the country, which provided funding for young aspiring academics to study in Europe. The revenue generated by the coffee industry in Costa Rica funded the first railroads linking the country to the Atlantic Coast in 1890, the “Ferrocarril al Atlántico”. The National Theater itself in San José {{is a product of the}} first coffee farmers in the country.|$|E
5000|$|Switchgrass {{has been}} {{researched}} as a renewable bioenergy crop since the mid-1980s, {{because it is a}} native perennial warm season grass with the ability to produce moderate to high yields on marginal farmlands. It is now being considered for use in several bioenergy conversion processes, including cellulosic ethanol production, biogas, and direct combustion for thermal energy applications. The main agronomic advantages of switchgrass as a bioenergy crop are its stand longevity, drought and flooding tolerance, relatively low herbicide and fertilizer input requirements, ease of management, hardiness in poor <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions,</b> and widespread adaptability in temperate climates. In some warm humid southern zones, such as Alabama, it has the ability to produce up to 25 oven-dry tonnes per hectare (ODT/ha). A summary of switchgrass yields across 13 research trial sites in the United States found the top two cultivars in each trial to yield 9.4 to 22.9 t/ha, with an average yield of 14.6 ODT/ha. However, these yields were recorded on small plot trials, and commercial field sites could be expected to be at least 20% lower than these results. In the United States, switchgrass yields appear to be highest in warm humid regions with long growing seasons such as the US Southeast and lowest in the dry short season areas of the Northern Great Plains. The energy inputs required to grow switchgrass are favorable when compared with annual seed bearing crops such as corn, soybean, or canola, which can require relatively high energy inputs for field operations, crop drying, and fertilization. Whole plant herbaceous perennial C4 grass feedstocks are desirable biomass energy feedstocks, as they require fewer fossil energy inputs to grow and effectively capture solar energy because of their C4 photosynthetic system and perennial nature. One study cites it takes from 0.97 to 1.34 GJ to produce 1 tonne of switchgrass, compared with 1.99 to 2.66 GJ to produce 1 tonne of corn. Another study found that switchgrass uses 0.8 GJ/ODT of fossil energy compared to grain corn's 2.9 GJ/ODT. [...] Given that switchgrass contains approximately 18.8 GJ/ODT of biomass, the energy output-to-input ratio for the crop can be up to 20:1. [...] This highly favorable ratio is attributable to its relatively high energy output per hectare and low energy inputs for production.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Bi˚Char soil {{amendment}} {{has been accepted}} as a low-risk soil carbon sequestration method. Some other agricultural benefits also reported in previous researches. Two kinds of bi˚Chars, produced from walnut shell and soft wood, with significantly different surface characteristics and a severe saline sandy loam soil was used in our research. Physical and chemical parameters of bi˚Char <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> were analyzed. The results pressure plate analysis indicated that high surface area bi˚Char can increase water retention and plant available water in severe saline agriculture soil, however, such effect wasn’t observed in all the low surface area bi˚Char treatments. Based on these results, a simulated soil water loss experiment was conducted under 3 different temperatures (from 25 ˚C to 40 ˚C), with 4 bi˚Char doses for 120 h. Our results shown that high dose of high surface area bi˚Char can reduce the rate of soil water loss under high temperature. Such effect indicated that high surface area bi˚Cahr can help soil hold more water under lab condition and simulated field condition. In bi˚Char soil application, the interaction between bi˚Char, <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> <b>condition</b> needs to be considered carefully to acheive optimum solution for both environmental and agricultural purposes...|$|R

Thus, there {{is the need for}} improved knowledge of the most appropriate irrigation scheduling practices to be adopted as well as the more adequate estimation of crop water requirements. With this objective, the simulation model SIMDualKc was adopted and calibrated. The model performs the calculation of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) with the methodology of the dual crop coefficient (Kc = Kcb + Ke), i. e., using a basal crop coefficient to estimate crop transpiration and an evaporation coefficient to estimation soil water evaporation. The research was conducted at the Experimental Station of Irrigation and Drainage, located in Alquízar, Havana, Cuba.
