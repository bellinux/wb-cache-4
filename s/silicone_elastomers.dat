40|$|The {{formation}} of biofilms on indwelling/implanted medical devices {{is a common}} problem. One of the approaches used to prevent biofilm formation on medical devices is to inhibit bacterial attachment by modification of the synthetic polymers used to fabricate the device. In this work, we assessed how micro-scale features (patterns) imprinted {{onto the surface of}} <b>silicone</b> <b>elastomer</b> similar to that used for medical applications influenced biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Patterns were transferred from a multi-patterned oxidized silicon-wafer master-template to <b>silicone</b> <b>elastomer.</b> Features consisted of bars, squares, and circles each extending 0. 51 µm above the surface. Feature sizes ranged between 1. 78 and 22. 25 µm. Distances separating features ranged between 0. 26 and 17. 35 µm. Bacterial biofilm formation on discs cut from imprinted <b>silicone</b> <b>elastomer</b> was assessed by direct microscopic observation and quantified as the surface area covered by biofilm. Unpatterned <b>silicone</b> <b>elastomer</b> served as a control. Several of the micro-scale patterns imprinted into the <b>silicone</b> <b>elastomer</b> significantly reduced biofilm formation by each bacterium and interrupted biofilm continuity.

50|$|The first <b>silicone</b> <b>elastomers</b> were {{developed}} {{in the search for}} better insulating materials for electric motors and generators. Resin-impregnated glass fibers were the state-of-the-art materials at the time.

50|$|Ionization {{processes}} require energy above 10 eV, while splitting {{covalent bonds}} in molecules and generating free radicals requires only 3-4 eV. The electrical discharges {{initiated by the}} ionization events by the particles result in plasma populated by large amount of free radicals. The highly reactive free radicals can recombine back to original molecules, or initiate a chain of free-radical polymerization reactions with other molecules, yielding compounds with increasing molecular weight. These high molecular weight compounds then precipitate from gaseous phase, forming conductive or non-conductive deposits on the electrodes and insulating surfaces of the detector and distorting its response. Gases containing hydrocarbon quenchers, e.g. argon-methane, are typically sensitive to aging by polymerization; addition of oxygen tends to lower the aging rates. Trace amounts of silicone oils, present from outgassing of <b>silicone</b> <b>elastomers</b> and especially from traces of silicone lubricants, tend to decompose and form deposits of silicon crystals on the surfaces. Gaseous mixtures of argon (or xenon) with carbon dioxide and optionally also with 2-3% of oxygen are highly tolerant to high radiation fluxes. The oxygen is added as noble gas with carbon dioxide has too high transparency for high-energy photons; ozone formed from the oxygen is a strong absorber of ultraviolet photons. Carbon tetrafluoride {{can be used as}} a component of the gas for high-rate detectors; the fluorine radicals produced during the operation however limit the choice of materials for the chambers and electrodes (e.g. gold electrodes are required, as the fluorine radicals attack metals, forming fluorides). Addition of carbon tetrafluoride can however eliminate the silicon deposits. Presence of hydrocarbons with carbon tetrafluoride leads to polymerization. A mixture of argon, carbon tetrafluoride, and carbon dioxide shows low aging in high hadron flux.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Dielectric {{elastomer}} (DE) pre-stretching {{is a key}} {{aspect of}} attaining better actuation performance, as it helps prevent electromechanical instability (EMI) and usually lowers the Young's modulus, thus leading to easier deformation. The pre-stretched {DE} is not only susceptible to {{a high risk of}} tearing and the formation of mechanical defects, but films with sustained and substantial strain may also experience mechanical degradation. In this study a long-term mechanical reliability study of {DE} is performed. Young's moduli, dielectric breakdown strengths and dielectric permittivities of commercial silica-reinforced <b>silicone</b> <b>elastomers,</b> with and without an additional 35 (35 phr) of titanium dioxide (TiO 2), were investigated after being subjected to pre-stretching for various timespans at pre-stretches to strains of 60 and 120, respectively. The study shows that mechanical stability when pre-stretching is difficult to achieve with highly filled elastomers. However, despite the negative outlook for metal oxide-filled <b>silicone</b> <b>elastomers,</b> the study paves the way for reliable dielectric elastomers by indicating that simply post-curing <b>silicone</b> <b>elastomers</b> before use may increase reliability...|$|E

In this study, several bulk and surface modifications of <b>silicone</b> <b>elastomers</b> using polyethylene glycol (PEG) were investigated.

40|$|<b>Silicone</b> <b>elastomers</b> are {{becoming}} more and more prevalent for Food Industry. This is because with the fact that the curing systems of organic elastomers often include amines and other additives leading to potential toxic contaminants, such as nitrosamines.
