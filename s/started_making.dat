5|$|An {{important}} {{development of}} vector spaces {{is due to}} the construction of function spaces by Lebesgue. This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert, around 1920. At that time, algebra and the new field of functional analysis began to interact, notably with key concepts such as spaces of p-integrable functions and Hilbert spaces. Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches <b>started</b> <b>making</b> use of this concept.|$|E

5|$|In London the Warren brothers, Thomas and Jonathan, <b>started</b> <b>making</b> {{blacking}} around 1795-1798, initially {{in partnership}} {{and then as}} competing companies. Jonathan Warren's Blacking company is notable as the first employer of the young Charles Dickens aged 12 in 1823. The competitor to the Warren companies in London is the Day & Martin company formed in 1801.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2010s, British public-service {{broadcaster}} Channel 4 resolved {{to improve the}} accuracy and depth of their representation of transgender people.

It was rebroadcast in the UK on More4 in 2012, and on ABC2 in Australia in 2013.

5|$|The {{rapprochement}} {{was not to}} last long, as on 13 April 1975 a coup d'état removed Tombalbaye {{and replaced}} him with General Félix Malloum. As the coup was partly motivated by opposition to Tombalbaye's appeasement of Libya, Gaddafi considered it a menace to his influence and resumed supplying the FROLINAT. In April 1976, there was a Gaddafi-backed attempted assassination of Malloum, {{and in the same}} year Libyan troops <b>started</b> <b>making</b> forays into central Chad in company of FROLINAT forces.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} {{to the arrival of}} the Crusaders, the regent of Damascus, Mu'in ad-Din Unur, <b>started</b> <b>making</b> feverish preparations for war, strengthening the fortifications of Damascus, ordering troops to his city and having the water sources along the road to Damascus destroyed or diverted. Anur sought help from the Zangid rulers of Aleppo and Mosul (who were normally his rivals), though forces from these states did not arrive in time to see combat outside of Damascus. It is almost certain that the Zangid rulers delayed sending troops to Damascus out of the hope that their rival Anur might lose his city to the Crusaders.|$|E
5|$|When Guggenheim {{closed her}} gallery in 1947 {{to move to}} Venice, artists like Pollock had to find new representation. The Betty Parsons Gallery, which opened the {{previous}} year, began representing Pollock, Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still. Parsons was already representing Adolph Gottlieb, Hedda Sterne and Theodoros Stamos. It was while Pollock showed at Parsons' gallery that he <b>started</b> <b>making</b> his iconic drip-paintings in 1947. It was also here that Barnett Newman exhibited his first breakthrough works in 1950. Rothko, who had arrived at his distinctive mural sized paintings in 1947, first exhibited them at the Parsons Gallery.|$|E

5|$|As Isma'il al-Azhari {{began to}} assert his power, both Sayyid Ali al-Mirghani and Sayyid Abd al-Rahman became {{concerned}} that they would lose their political influence. From October 1955 Sayyid Ali began to seek ways to oust Isma'il al-Azhari from power. A key issue was whether a plebiscite should be held to determine if Sudan was to be independent of Egypt, which Sayyid Ali supported and Isma'il al-Azhari opposed. To strengthen his position in parliament, Isma'il al-Azhari <b>started</b> <b>making</b> overtures to associates of Sayyid Abd al-Rahman to explore {{the idea of an}} NUP-Umma coalition. Sudan formally became independent on 1 January 1956. On 2 February 1956 Isma'il al-Azhari announced a new cabinet that included representatives of all political parties and factions.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{have been}} an {{important}} source of food for humans at least since Roman times and empty shells found in middens at archaeological sites are evidence of earlier consumption. Oysters, scallops, clams, ark clams, mussels and cockles are the most commonly consumed kinds of bivalve, and are eaten cooked or raw. In 1950, the year in which the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) <b>started</b> <b>making</b> such information available, world trade in bivalve molluscs was 1,007,419 tons. By 2010, world trade in bivalves had risen to 14,616,172 tons, up from 10,293,607 tons a decade earlier. The figures included 5,554,348 (3,152,826) tons of clams, cockles and ark shells, 1,901,314 (1,568,417) tons of mussels, 4,592,529 (3,858,911) tons of oysters and 2,567,981 (1,713,453) tons of scallops. China increased its consumption 400-fold during the period 1970 to 1997.|$|E
5|$|If a reborn {{is created}} from a kit {{as opposed to}} whole {{manufactured}} doll, it may be called newborning. Manufacturers have reacted to the growing trend of artists transforming dolls by hiring reborn artists to become doll sculptors and design doll molds and kits. When newborning from a kit, the first several steps of the process are completed by reborn sculpt artists and doll manufacturers. The kits come with an already disassembled baby and select supplies. Other supplies not provided in the kit can be purchased separately. The Secrist doll company <b>started</b> <b>making</b> Reborn Doll Kits in 2005. In 2009, they began producing supplies, tools, and tutorial videos specifically for reborning or newborning. JC Toys began selling kits in December 2007 Other suppliers offer product lines that give reborners a choice of body parts and skin tones to make a customized doll.|$|E

5|$|In April, Sakanaction {{had already}} <b>started</b> <b>making</b> songs for Shin-shiro, despite having just {{finished}} their tour in March for the band's second album Night Fishing, {{which had been}} released in January of the same year. The album's production took {{a different approach to}} how Go to the Future and Night Fishing were produced. In their previous albums Yamaguchi produced the song demos, then took them to the studio and explained his vision for each song; creating them in sessions with all of the band members. For Shin-shiro, Yamaguchi created the songs, and then assigned each member of the band to create a demo based on their two-person vision. This was a conscious move by Yamaguchi to create a new sound for the album, figuring that if all of members were concurrently working on the songs, it was inevitable that one person would take charge of each song.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg (1797–1871) <b>started</b> <b>making</b> pianos in 1835 {{from his}} house in Seesen {{at the edge of}} the Harz mountains; a source of fine beech and spruce wood for the instruments. Among the pianos that Steinweg {{produced}} in his first year was a square piano designed by and built for Friedrick Grotrian. (This instrument is now in the Braunschweig museum.) H.E. Steinweg entered three of his pianos in a state fair in 1839, two of them square pianos, but his grand piano brought wide notice. In 1850, H.E. Steinweg took most of his large family to New York City, leaving the piano factory to his eldest son C.F. Theodor Steinweg (1825–1889) who stayed behind to run it under his own name. Meanwhile, in New York City, the Steinweg family Americanized their surname to Steinway and in 1853 they founded the piano manufacturer Steinway & Sons.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} further enhance the appeal of its new {{flagship}} product, in 1993 the firm established a Communication Services division, designed {{to tap into the}} commercial market. The firm <b>started</b> <b>making</b> deals with major telecommunication companies, such as BellSouth and MCI Inc. in preparation for the services the firm was about to offer. In November of that year the division launched its Fax Broadcast service. The Fax Broadcast service allowed subscribers to upload a single fax and a recipient list to Delrina. Systems at Delrina would then send out the fax to the recipients on that list, to a maximum of 500 fax numbers. A subsequent Fax Mailbox feature—which enabled subscribers to remotely access both fax and voice messages from a single phone number—was initially held up following a dispute with AlphaNet Telecom for the rights to the technology. This dispute was resolved by June 1994, though with both sides publicly disputing the story of the other, and with AlphaNet receiving an undisclosed sum in compensation.|$|E

5|$|Other early leather {{preserving}} products {{included the}} Irish brand Punch, which was first made in 1851. In 1889, an English {{man by the}} name of William Edward Wren, <b>started</b> <b>making</b> shoe polishes and dubbin under the brand name Wren's. In just 3 years, he won the “First in the Field – First Award Leather Trades Exhibition 1892″ award which was awarded by the Leather Trades Exhibition held in Northampton, the centre of Britain’s boot making industry. This signified the importance and prestige of the exhibition in the trade and was a recognition of Wren's quality. In 1890 the Kroner Brothers established EOS, a shoe polish factory in Berlin, which serviced the Prussian military. It finally closed in 1934 when the Nazis forbade Jews to operate a business. The German brand, Erdal, went on sale in 1901.|$|E
5|$|The now {{recurring}} character Professor Frink {{makes his}} first appearance on the show in this episode. Frink was originally written as a mad scientist, but when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed a voice for Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's The Nutty Professor character, and the writing staff <b>started</b> <b>making</b> Frink more of a parody of Lewis. Frink was named after The Simpsons writer John Frink; however, that was {{before he became a}} writer for the show. The episode features a guest appearance from American actress Audrey Meadows as Bea. Al Jean, a writer on the show, said Meadows was perfect for the role because she was very sweet, and the staff {{had a lot of fun}} during the recording sessions with her. This is the only episode to date where the closing credits actually states which characters each actor voices. This was done because the staff often received questions from fans regarding what characters each voice actor provided the voice for.|$|E
