5|$|One day I chanced {{to see a}} {{performance}} of the Bunraku puppet theater and was very surprised by it. It was in the tone quality, the timbre, of the futazao shamisen, the wide-necked shamisen used in Bunraku, that I first recognized the <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> traditional Japanese music. I was very moved by it and I wondered why my attention had never been captured before by this Japanese music.|$|E

25|$|The cathedral is {{frequently}} the most imposing building, {{and one of}} the most ancient buildings in its town. The great size and <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> the cathedral may be out of all proportion to the town itself. The money and talents expended on the building are seen as honoring God, and may also demonstrate both the devotion and the status of the patrons.|$|E
25|$|The Adil Shahi Sultans {{who ruled}} for nearly 200 years in Bijapur had {{expended}} their utmost authority, almost exclusively, on architecture and the allied arts, each Sultan endeavored to excel his predecessor in the number, size, or <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> his building projects. As a result, the buildings seen {{in and around}} Bijapur Fort and the town have been rightly called as the Agra of South India.|$|E

25|$|Haninai's posthumous son Bostanai was {{the first}} of the exilarchs under Arabic rule. Bostanai was the {{ancestor}} of the exilarchs who were in office from the time when the Persian empire was conquered by the Arabs, in 642, down to the 11th century. Through him, the <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> the office was renewed and its political position made secure. His tomb in Pumbedita was a place of worship as late as the 12th century, according to Benjamin of Tudela.|$|E

The basic medical school program lasts seven years. There is also a second medical school in the country, it is private and located in Punta del Este, Maldonado.|$|E
25|$|The new dynasty {{moved the}} capital of Thonburi to Rattanakosin, today's Bangkok. Bangkok had {{previously}} been a small settlement with a fort, but it was strategically located on the eastern shores of the Chao Phraya river and was known among the foreign traders as the 'key to Siam'. New palaces and temples were built. The Emerald Buddha and Wat Phra Kaeo were founded. The king's goal was to transfer the old <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> Ayutthaya to the new capital. In his new capital, Rama I crowned himself in 1785 in a splendid ceremony.|$|E

25|$|Zemfira asks Aleko if {{he misses}} the <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> his homeland, but he {{responds}} that his only desire is {{to spend his}} life with her in voluntary exile. (ll.174–176). The Old Man warns that although Aleko loves the Gypsy life, this feeling may not last forever, and tells {{a story of a}} man that he knew who spent his entire life with the Gypsies but who eventually pined for his homeland and asked to be buried there. (ll.181–216). This is thought to be a reference to the Roman poet Ovid, who was banished to Tomis in 8AD.|$|E
25|$|This {{incident}} {{was a sign}} of Elizabeth's strong and distinctive personality. This difficult experience seems to have made her, {{for the first time in}} her young life, fully aware of the serious, even deadly, nature of her succession rights to the throne. When she made her first public appearance at court 18 months later, just turning 17, she dressed in a simple, somber manner with plain and unadorned hair. This contrasted sharply with the showy <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> the other ladies present, as if she was trying to live down the scandal of her association with Thomas.|$|E
25|$|Paul VI did {{away with}} much of the regal <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> the papacy. He was the last pope to date to be crowned; his {{successor}} Pope John Paul I replaced the Papal Coronation (which Paul had already substantially modified, but which he left mandatory in his 1975 apostolic constitution Romano Pontifici Eligendo) with a Papal Inauguration. Paul VI donated his own Papal Tiara, a gift from his former Archdiocese of Milan, to the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, DC (where it is on permanent display in the Crypt) as a gift to American Catholics.|$|E

25|$|The {{nature of}} the Emerald City is changed in the film. In the book, the city is not {{actually}} all green, but everyone is forced to wear green tinted spectacles (ostensibly to protect their eyes from the glory and <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> the luxurious city), thus making everything appear green. In the film, the city is actually all green. The architecture of the Emerald City in the movie uses a much more contemporary Art Deco style than Baum could have imagined. In the book, a giant green wall studded in glittering emeralds surrounds the entire city, whereas in the movie {{there is only a}} gate opening.|$|E
25|$|In {{many places}} {{throughout}} the Hebrew Scriptures – particularly the Book of Hosea – Israel is figured as Yahweh's wife or bride. Malachi's discussion of divorce {{may also be}} understood to conform to this metaphor. Malachi {{could very well be}} urging his audience not to break faith with Yahweh (the God of Israel) by adopting new gods or idols. It is quite likely that, since the people of Judah were questioning Yahweh's love and justice (1:2, 2:17), they might be tempted to adopt foreign gods. William LaSor suggests that, because the restoration to the land of Judah had not resulted in anything like the prophesied <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> the messianic age which had been prophesied, the people were becoming quite disillusioned with their religion.|$|E
25|$|In 640 BC, the Elamites were {{defeated}} by Ashurbanipal, coming {{under the rule}} of the Assyrians who brought destruction upon Susa and Chogha Zanbil. But in 538 BC, Cyrus the Great was able to re-conquer the Elamite lands after nearly 80 years of Median rule. The city of Susa was then proclaimed as one of the Achaemenid capitals. Darius the Great then erected a grand palace known as Apadana there in 521 BC. But this astonishing period of glory and <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> the Achaemenian dynasty came to an end by the conquests of Alexander of Macedon. The Susa weddings was arranged by Alexander in 324 BC in Susa, where mass weddings took place between the Persians and the Macedonians. After Alexander, the Seleucid dynasty came to rule the area.|$|E

25|$|Elsewhere {{within the}} Vatican, Bernini created {{systematic}} rearrangements and majestic embellishment of either empty or aesthetically undistinguished space that exist as he designed {{them to the}} present day and have become indelible icons of the <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> the papal precincts. Within the hitherto unadorned apse of the basilica, the Cathedra Petri, the symbolic throne of St Peter, was rearranged as a monumental gilded bronze extravagance that matched the Baldacchino created earlier in the century. Bernini's complete reconstruction of the Scala Regia, the stately papal stairway between St. Peters's and the Vatican Palace, was slightly less ostentatious in appearance but still taxed Bernini's creative powers (employing, for example, clever tricks of optical illusion) to create a seemingly uniform, totally functional, but nonetheless regally impressive stairway to connect two irregular buildings within an even more irregular space.|$|E
25|$|Penn {{returned}} {{home for the}} extraordinary <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> the King's restoration ceremony and was a guest of honor alongside his father, who received a highly unusual royal salute for his services to the Crown. Though undetermined at the time, the Admiral had great hopes for his son's career under the favour of the King. Back at Oxford, Penn considered a medical career and took some dissecting classes. Rational thought began to spread into science, politics and economics, which he took a liking to. When theologian John Owen was fired from his deanery, Penn and other open-minded students rallied to his side and attended seminars at the dean's house, where intellectual discussions covered the gamut of new thought. Penn learned the valuable skills of forming ideas into theory, discussing theory through reasoned debate, and testing the theories in the real world.|$|E
25|$|The hall {{contained}} valuable furniture, {{such as the}} Pentapyrgion ("Five Towers"), a cupboard {{built by}} Emperor Theophilos (r. 829–842) that displayed precious vases, crowns and other valuable objects. During imperial banquets, it featured a gilded principal table for thirty high-ranking dignitaries, {{as well as two}} to four additional tables for 18 persons each. On occasion, the emperor is described as having his own table, set apart from the rest. The full ceremonial <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> the hall was reserved for special occasions, such as the banquets for Arab envoys, described in the De Ceremoniis: additional lightning was provided by great chandeliers, imperial regalia, relics and other precious items were brought from various churches and displayed in the apses, while the meal was accompanied by music from two silver and two golden organs, placed in the porch, {{as well as by the}} choirs of the Hagia Sophia and the Holy Apostles.|$|E
