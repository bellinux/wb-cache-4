500|$|Originally named Netjer-isut-Menkauhor by the Ancient Egyptians, meaning [...] "The divine {{places of}} Menkauhor", the pyramid is {{known today as}} Lepsius XXIX after the number given to it by the {{archaeologist}} Karl Richard Lepsius who discovered the pyramid in 1843. Owing to the ruined <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure,</b> it is known in Arabic as the [...] "Headless Pyramid", a name that has been retained. The pyramid was lost under shifting sands in the early 20th century and its attribution to Menkauhor was consequently debated. Instead, it was proposed that the Headless Pyramid was that of Merikare, a structure dating to the First Intermediate Period and which {{has yet to be}} found. In 2008, the structure identified by Lepsius was rediscovered by a team of archaeologists under the direction of Zahi Hawass, and excavations at the site quickly established a Fifth Dynasty date as indicated by the construction techniques used in its making. Although the excavations failed to yield the name of the king who built the pyramid, Menkauhor was the last pharaoh of the dynasty whose pyramid remained undiscovered. Thus, proceeding by elimination, archeologists and egyptologists have formally recognized the Headless Pyramid as that of Menkauhor.|$|E
50|$|Another way {{to define}} an ADT, {{closer to the}} spirit of {{functional}} programming, is to consider each <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> as a separate entity.

Unlike the imperative operations, these functions have no side effects. Therefore, the order in which they are evaluated is immaterial, and the same operation applied to the same arguments (including the same input states) will always return the same results (and output states).|$|E

The <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> was documented prior to restoration, from about 2003 through 2004, including the production of three-dimensional photogrammetric models due to the gate's architectural complexity.

The scaffolding and cover were removed in late 2008 following the initial restoration phase.|$|E
50|$|On August 7, 1809, {{the monastic}} order {{in charge of}} the church was suppressed, and on January 12, 1809, the monastery was sold by the Minister of Finance to a private citizen Cosimo d'Orazio.

It was rebuilt to a design in the perpendicular style by David Laing (then architect to the Board of Customs) with assistance from William Tite. The foundation stone was laid in November 1817 and the church re-opened for worship in January 1821. Built of Portland stone, with a plaster lierne nave vault, it was 115 feet long and 65 feet wide and could accommodate between six and seven hundred people. The cost of the work was £36,000.

50|$|The {{portion of}} the SHM process that has {{received}} the least attention in the technical literature {{is the development of}} statistical models for discrimination between features from the undamaged and damaged structures. Statistical model development is concerned with the implementation of the algorithms that operate on the extracted features to quantify the damage <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure.</b> The algorithms used in statistical model development usually fall into three categories. When data are available from both the undamaged and damaged structure, the statistical pattern recognition algorithms fall into the general classification referred to as supervised learning. Group classification and regression analysis are categories of supervised learning algorithms. Unsupervised learning refers to algorithms that are applied to data not containing examples from the damaged structure. Outlier or novelty detection is the primary class of algorithms applied in unsupervised learning applications. All of the algorithms analyze statistical distributions of the measured or derived features to enhance the damage identification process.|$|E

The station of the settlement of Rentzschmühle, which is part of the Saxon municipality of Pöhl, lies in the valley of the White Elster on the edge of the Thuringian village of Cossengrün. The wooden entrance building is surrounded by several half-timbered houses. Barthmühle (...) Barthmühle station was opened on 15 July 1879 as a halt and it was reclassified as a station in 1905. The station is located in the district of Barthmühle of the municipality of Pöhl. The Leipzig-Hof railway crosses the Gera-Weischlitz railway south of the station on the Elster Viaduct. There is a halt on the latter railway in the town of Jocketa, which lies only a few kilometres to the east of Barthmühle station. The station has a timber-framed entrance building. Plauen (Vogtl) Chrieschwitz (...) Plauen (Vogtl) Chrieschwitz station was opened on 1 June 1923 with the commissioning of the Lottengrün-Plauen railway. This line from the east was subsequently extended from the station to provide two tracks to Plauen lower station. In 1946, the second track was dismantled to provide reparations. The line to Lottengrün was dismantled at the beginning of 1970. In the area that was released, a pallet yard was built during the building of the Plattenbau district of Plauen-Chrieschwitz. In addition, a number of factories were also connected to the station with sidings; only the siding to a steel construction company is currently operated.

The sensitivity {{is presented in the}} form of the probability distribution of the limit <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure.</b> The analysis is performed by the problem-oriented Monte Carlo simulation procedure. The procedure is based on the problem's definition of the elementary event, as a structural limit state. Thus the sample space consists of limit states of the structure. Defined on the sample space the one-dimensional random multiplier is introduced. This multiplier refers to the dominant basic variable (group of variables) of the problem. Numerical procedure results in the set of random numbers. Normalized relative histogram of this set is an estimator of the PDF of the limit <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure.</b> Estimators of reliability, or the probability of failure are statistical characteristics of this histogram.
