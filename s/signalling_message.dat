5000|$|Where a <b>signalling</b> <b>message</b> travels from North America to {{the rest}} of the world or from the rest of the world to North America, there must be a {{conversion}} done from E.212 based global title to E.214 based global title. This conversion is reasonably simple, well defined and fully reversible.|$|E
50|$|Once a <b>signalling</b> <b>message</b> with an E.214 number {{enters a}} mobile network {{in its own}} country, the routing is {{dependent}} on the operator of that mobile network.

50|$|The VRR {{protocol}} uses 3 <b>signalling</b> <b>message</b> types.

RREQ and RREP are situated inside the WRA field of WSA frame and on each hop the WSA frame is discarded and a new WSA frame created. Both messages are transmitted in the lowest Traffic Class (background).|$|E

30|$|Malicious RSs {{may try to}} replay {{the control}} {{messages}} in order to cause a DoS to their superordinate or to tamper {{with the results of}} the QoS estimation. The 3 TCACs will resist to the DoS because they are configured to not process more than n[*]signalling messages overall. Besides, each <b>signalling</b> <b>message</b> encompasses a timestamp value added by the issuing 3 TCAC and marking the instant of its generation. As all the 3 TCACs are synchronized, replayed messages are easily detected by the receiving 3 TCAC which has to verify its current timestamp value in order to decide whether the message is replayed. All replayed messages will be simply ignored. Malicious RSs may also try to usurp the identity of other RSs or modify the integrity of the <b>signalling</b> <b>message</b> in order to tamper with the results of QoS estimation. This attack is detected since all signalling messages are created by the 3 TCACs which also sign them.

30|$|In a real scenario, if a {{mobility}} management protocol {{has a high}} signalling cost, {{the control}} plane implemented in the mobility management protocol introduces a high amount of <b>signalling</b> <b>messages.</b> This cost is produced due to the <b>signalling</b> <b>messages</b> sent to the mobility anchor nodes during the handover or due to a frequent signalling to track the mobility of the MN.|$|R

30|$|The second relay {{selection}} strategy {{also increases}} the overhead, since the channel gains between any {{two pairs of}} users must be known by the BS. In the fixed relay strategy, only the channel gains between fixed source-relay pairs must be known. Once the BS has determined the values of P,a, and b, one <b>signalling</b> <b>message</b> must be sent to any user, indicating which RB it must use for its own data transmission, and if the user is a relay, which RB it should listen to perform decode and forward.

40|$|Control <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> in Mobile IPv 6 {{are mainly}} used {{to inform the}} home agent (HA) and the {{correspondent}} node (CN) about the mobile node’s (MN’s) new address when its network at-tachment point is changed. In order to prevent various security attacks, these messages must be protected. In the current standard, the control <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> between a HA and a MN are authenticated using IPSec, often with IKEv 2 and X. 509 certificates. Control <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> between a MN and a CN are currently protected by an effective but insecure protocol, known as Return Routability. Using IBE (Identity-Based Encryption) for authenticating control <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> requires more processing power but significant security enhancements are achieved. The current protocols for protecting control <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> are outlined in this paper. Pro-posed approaches for implementing IBE-authentication between a MN and a HA as well as be-tween a MN and a CN are presented. Environments where the MN and the CN use the same Pub-lic Key Generator (PKG) as well as environments where they use different PKGs are taken into account. Finally, the performance of some proposed signaling protocols is estimated.

40|$|For MIPv 6, once an MN {{changes its}} location, it sends binding update {{messages}} to its HA {{which results in}} significant overhead of the <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> if the handoff frequency increases. HMIPv 6, therefore, was proposed to reduce the <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> and handoff latency by using MAP. However, when {{a large number of}} MNs move in the same MAP domain, the limited capacity and resource of MAP will become the bottleneck of the transmission. This will increase the blocking probability of MNs or even cause the crash of MAP. In this paper, we propose an HMIPv 6 -based distributed architecture with integrated resource allocation mechanism to release the bottleneck problem and reduce the <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> overhead...|$|R
40|$|The Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv 6 (FMIPv 6) {{protocol}} was {{developed from the}} experience of MIPv 6 and the facilities provided by link layer triggers, allowing for a proactive approach to handover that minimises packet exchange delay and packet loss.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the jitter on the wireless edge links between the RS and the managed SSs, the RS- 3 TCAC sends a QoS-REQ <b>signalling</b> <b>message</b> to its payload entity and then triggers the trusted absolute timestamping service. The 3 TCAE entity forwards the received packet to the SS which should answer with a first QoS-RSP message. 3 TCAE receives the QoS-RSP and then forwards it to the RS- 3 TCAC which computes the edge delay between the RS and the SS. As the jitter computation requires a synchronization between the entity which will send {{the equivalent of the}} RTP packets each 20 ms and the entity which will receive them, the RS- 3 TCAC and the SS need to have the same clock values.|$|E
30|$|The DoS attacks may {{be caused}} by {{malicious}} RSs which refuse to forward the signalling messages carrying the QoS information or participating in evaluating this information. In order to tolerate the attacks targeting the QoS estimation, each 3 TCAC is configured to raise an exception if the periodic <b>signalling</b> <b>message</b> is not received within a pre-configured threshold time period. In this case, the 3 TCAC increments its own[*]p r o b a b l y-m a l i c i o u s-R S[*]variable and the[*]p r o b a b l y-m a l i c i o u s-R S[*]variable of the considered subordinate and an alert will bep sent to the managing MR-BS if the[*]p r o b a b l y-m a l i c i o u s-R S[*]variable reaches a threshold value.|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{malicious}} RSs may try various time-related and DoS attacks. Unfortunately, isolating such malicious actors will dramatically decrease {{the coverage area}} since the relay topology is a tree and the isolation of one RS may doom a whole branch. To address this issue, the MR-BS managing the malicious RS will calculate the delay and/or jitter induced by its presence {{and then it will}} compensate it according to the load of the involved links. The compensation is fulfilled through executing a new CAC with updated values of delay, jitter and throughput. Note that the MR-BS may send a different <b>signalling</b> <b>message</b> containing different delay, throughput or jitter values in order to individually perform admission control on the links forming the path to the destination as each link may have a different load condition. However, the MR-BS will choose the values for CAC so that the end-to-end QoS requirements are met even if each link on the path may provide a different QoS.|$|E
40|$|Distributed {{applications}} have wide ranging requirements. Message-based applications {{must now}} co-exist with multimedia-based applications that often require precise bounds on {{the delivery of}} data. A single best effort service is no longer sufficient. Attempts at supporting {{a wide variety of}} applications have come from different directions, and have inevitably led to a scenario where one is better at supporting a certain type of application than the other. What is clear is that different network services and different protocol stacks are required in order to satisfy the needs of the emerging variety of application types. This paper discusses an approach to providing seamless integration for different network control mechanisms, providing access to network services in a clear and consistent manner. We build on the previously defined Open Service Model and introduce the idea of meta-signalling, used to negotiate end-to-end network requirements. We employ the Internet Protocol as a means for signalling control information, and object technology as a mechanism for providing distributed resource management. We look at the requirements for a signalling protocol, notably reliability, low bit rate and low delay, and consider how {{in the context of an}} IP network we can provide a level of quality of service for <b>signalling</b> <b>message...</b>|$|E
