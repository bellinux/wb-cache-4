40|$|Birdsong is {{a widely}} used model for vocal {{learning}} and human speech, which exhibits high temporal and acoustic diversity. Rapid acoustic modulations are thought to arise from the vocal organ, the syrinx, by passive interactions between the two independent sound generators or intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of sound generating structures. Additionally, direct neuromuscular control could produce such rapid and precisely timed acoustic features if syringeal muscles exhibit rare superfast muscle contractile kinetics. However, no direct evidence exists that avian vocal muscles can produce modulations at such high rates. Here, we show that 1) syringeal muscles are active in phase with <b>sound</b> <b>modulations</b> during song over 200 Hz, 2) direct stimulation of the muscles in situ produces <b>sound</b> <b>modulations</b> at the frequency observed during singing, and that 3) syringeal muscles produce mechanical work at the required frequencies and up to 250 Hz in vitro. The twitch kinematics of these so-called superfast muscles are the fastest measured in any vertebrate muscle. Superfast vocal muscles enable birds to directly control the generation of many observed rapid acoustic changes and to actuate the millisecond precision of neural activity into precise temporal vocal control. Furthermore, birds now join the list of vertebrate classes in which superfast muscle kinetics evolved independently for acoustic communication...|$|R

50|$|The next {{development}} in stylus form came {{about by the}} attention to the CD-4 quadraphonic <b>sound</b> <b>modulation</b> process, which requires up to 50 kHz frequency response, with cartridges like Technics EPC-100CMK4 capable of playback on frequencies up to 100 kHz.

A narrow-profile elliptical stylus is {{able to read the}} higher frequencies (greater than 20 kHz), but at an increased wear, since the contact surface is narrower. For overcoming this problem, the Shibata stylus was invented around 1972 in Japan by Norio Shibata of JVC, fitted as standard on quadraphonic cartridges, and marketed as an extra on some high-end cartridges.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWhile musical {{gestures}} {{have been}} mapped to control synthesizers, tracked or recognized by machines {{to interact with}} sounds or musicians, one may wish to continue them automatically, in the same style {{as they have been}} initiated by a performer.

This gesture-based sound synthesis, as opposed to model-based synthesis, would open the way for performers to explore new means of expression and to define and play with even more <b>sound</b> <b>modulations</b> at the same time. We define this new task and address it by a baseline continuation system.

In this study, the linear period <b>modulation</b> <b>sounds,</b> mimicking the emitting pulse of big brown bats, were introduced as the emitted signals.

40|$|We characterised {{task-related}} top-down {{signals in}} monkey auditory cortex cells by comparing single-unit activity during passive sound exposure with neuronal activity during a predictable and unpredictable reaction-time task {{for a variety}} of spectral-temporally modulated broadband sounds. Although animals were not trained to attend to particular spectral or temporal <b>sound</b> <b>modulations,</b> their reaction times demonstrated clear acoustic spectral-temporal sensitivity for unpredictable modulation onsets. Interestingly, this sensitivity was absent for predictable trials with fast manual responses, but re-emerged for the slower reactions in these trials. Our analysis of neural activity patterns revealed a task-related dynamic modulation of auditory cortex neurons that was locked to the animal's reaction time, but invariant to the spectral and temporal acoustic modulations. This finding suggests dissociation between acoustic and behavioral signals at the single-unit level. We further demonstrated that single-unit activity during task execution can be described by a multiplicative gain modulation of acoustic-evoked activity and a task-related top-down signal, rather than by linear summation of these signals...|$|R

Such variations are linked to a morphological constraint. Also, the existent relationship between fish size and swimbladder size implies that the swimbladder might be involved in the sound production. Sound analyses in Amphiprion clarkii showed that the experimental filling of the swimbladder with physiological liquid (NaCl 9 â°) significantly modified the acoustic features.

40|$|Objective: <b>Sound</b> <b>modulation</b> is a {{critical}} temporal cue for the perception of speech and environmental sounds. To examine auditory cortical responses to <b>sound</b> <b>modulation,</b> we developed an acoustic change stimulus involving amplitude modulation (AM) of ongoing noise. The AM transitions in this stimulus evoked an acoustic change complex (ACC) that was examined parametrically in terms of rate and depth of modulation and hemispheric symmetry. Methods: Auditory cortical potentials were recorded from 64 scalp electrodes during passive listening in two conditions: (1) ACC from white noise to 4, 40, 300 Hz AM, with varying AM depths of 100, 50, 25 % lasting one second and (2) one second AM noise bursts at the same modulation rate. Behavioral measures included AM detection from an attend ACC condition and AM depth thresholds (i. e., a temporal modulation transfer function, TMTF). Results: The N 1 response of the ACC was large to 4 and 40 Hz and small to the 300 Hz AM. In contrast, the opposite pattern was observed with bursts of AM showing larger responses with increases in AM rate. Brain source modeling showed significant hemispheric asymmetry such that 4 and 40 Hz ACC responses were dominated by right and left hemispheres respectively. Conclusion: N 1 responses to the ACC resembled a low pass filter shape similar to a behavioral TMTF. In the ACC paradigm, the only stimulus parameter that changes is AM and therefore the N 1 response provides an index for this AM change. In contrast, an AM burst stimulus contains both AM and level changes and is likely dominated by the rise time of the stimulus. The hemispheric differences {{are consistent with the}} asymmetric sampling in time hypothesis suggesting that the different hemispheres preferentially sample acoustic time across different time windows. Significance: The ACC provides a novel approach to studying temporal processing at the level of cortex and provides further evidence of hemispheric specialization for fast and slow stimuli...|$|E

Our work aims at contributing to this research question adopting a comparative and philosophical approach to the origins of verbal language. In particular, we adopt three strands of analysis that are relevant {{in the context of}} comparative investigation on the the origins of verbal language: a) research on the evolutionary âhomologiesâ, which provides information on the phylogenetic traits that humans and other primates share with their common ancestor; b) investigations on âanalogousâ traits, aimed at finding the evolutionary pressures that guided the emergence of the same biological traits that evolved independently in phylogenetically distant species; the ontogenetic development of the ability to produce and understand verbal language in human infants. Within this comparative approach, we focus on three key apsects that we addressed bridging recent empiric evidence on language processing with philosophical investigations on verbal language: (i) pattern processing as a biologocal precursor of syntax and algebraic rule acquisition, (ii) <b>sound</b> <b>modulation</b> as a guide to pattern comprehension in speech, animal vocalization and music, (iii) social strategies for mutual understanding, survival and group cohesion.
