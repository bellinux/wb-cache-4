25|$|Using matrix matched {{calibration}} standards can compensate for ion suppression. Using this technique, {{calibration standards}} are prepared in identical <b>sample</b> <b>matrix</b> {{to that used}} for analysis (e.g. plasma) by spiking a normal sample with known concentrations of analyte. This is not always possible for biological samples, since the analyte of interest is often endogenously present in a clinically significant, albeit normal, quantity. For matrix matched calibration standards {{to be effective in}} compensating for ion suppression, the <b>sample</b> <b>matrix</b> must be free of the analyte of interest. Additionally, it is important that there is little variation in test sample composition since both the test sample and the prepared calibration sample must be affected in the same way by ion suppression. Again, in complex biological samples from different individuals, or even the same individual at a different time, there may be large fluctuations in the concentrations of ion suppressing species.|$|E
25|$|Put simply, ion {{suppression}} {{describes the}} {{adverse effect on}} detector response due to reduced ionisation efficiency for analyte(s) of interest, resulting from the presence of species in the <b>sample</b> <b>matrix</b> which compete for ionisation, or inhibit efficient ionisation in other ways. Use of MS/MS {{as a means of}} detection may give the impression that there are no interfering species present, since no chromatographic impurities are detected. However, species which are not isobaric may still have an adverse effect on the sensitivity, accuracy and precision of the assay owing to suppression of the ionisation of the analyte of interest.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a compressive sampling (CS) scheme for pulse stream images. We adopt a particular sparse <b>sampling</b> <b>matrix,</b> {{that we call}} Radon-like CS matrix. Whilst the Radon transform evaluates projections of a given image along different directions, the Radon-like CS matrix evaluates randomly weighted projections of the image along a few directions.

40|$|The most {{frequently}} used condition for <b>sampling</b> <b>matrices</b> employed in compressive sampling is the restricted isometry (RIP) property of the matrix when restricted to sparse signals. At the same time, imposing this condition {{makes it difficult to}} find explicit matrices that support recovery of signals from sketches of the optimal (smallest possible) dimension. A number of {{attempts have been made to}} relax or replace the RIP property in sparse recovery algorithms. We focus on the relaxation under which the near-isometry property holds for most rather than for all submatrices of the <b>sampling</b> <b>matrix,</b> known as statistical RIP or StRIP condition. We show that <b>sampling</b> <b>matrices</b> of dimensions $m\times N$ with maximum coherence $\mu=O((k\log^ 3 N) ^{- 1 / 4 }) $ and mean square coherence $\bar \mu^ 2 =O(1 /(k\log N)) $ support stable recovery of $k$-sparse signals using Basis Pursuit. These assumptions are satisfied in many examples. As a result, we are able to construct <b>sampling</b> <b>matrices</b> that support recovery with low error for sparsity $k$ higher than $\sqrt m,$ which exceeds the range of parameters of the known classes of RIP matrices...|$|R

The central limit theorems (CLT's) for linear spectral statistics of high-dimensional non-centered <b>sample</b> covariance <b>matrices</b> have received considerable attention in random matrix theory and have been applied to many high-dimensional statistical problems. However, known population mean vectors are assumed for non-centered <b>sample</b> covariance <b>matrices,</b> some of which even assume Gaussian-like moment conditions. In fact, there are still another two most frequently used sample covariance matrices: the MLE (by subtracting the sample mean vector from each sample vector) and the unbiased <b>sample</b> covariance <b>matrix</b> (by changing the denominator n as N=n- 1 in the MLE) without depending on unknown population mean vectors. In this paper, we not only establish new CLT's for non-centered <b>sample</b> covariance <b>matrices</b> without Gaussian-like moment conditions but also characterize the non-negligible differences among the CLT's for the three classes of high-dimensional <b>sample</b> covariance <b>matrices</b> by establishing a substitution principle: substitute the adjusted sample size N=n- 1 for the actual sample size n in the major centering term of the new CLT's so as to obtain the CLT of the unbiased <b>sample</b> covariance <b>matrices.</b> Moreover, {{it is found that}} the difference between the CLT's for the MLE and unbiased <b>sample</b> covariance <b>matrix</b> is non-negligible in the major centering term although the two <b>sample</b> covariance <b>matrices</b> only have differences n and n- 1 on the dominator.
