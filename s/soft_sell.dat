Frank Kardes and others have concluded that a <b>soft</b> <b>sell,</b> with an implied conclusion rather than an overt hard sell, can often be more persuasive. <b>Soft</b> <b>sell</b> is also less likely to be irritating to consumers.|$|E

50|$|When {{situations}} change, a <b>soft</b> <b>sell</b> {{is used to}} {{help promote}} a brand and make the product likable {{in the eyes of}} the consumer. Warmth and desire towards a brand induces a connection between the product and the consumer, rather than action on the product by the consumer. Immediacy and urgent buying is not involved in a <b>soft</b> <b>sell,</b> but long-term value and loyalty to a brand can be established.|$|E

50|$|A <b>soft</b> <b>sell</b> is {{much more}} emotionally focused when put in {{comparison}} to a hard sell. An advertisement or seller will attempt to trigger feelings in the buyer that will make them want to buy the product that is being advertised. This selling technique is also much more indirect in nature {{than that of a}} hard sell. The subtlety of a <b>soft</b> <b>sell</b> is very evident, and many buyers often do not realize that they are being purposely directed in such a way to buy a product how a seller predicts that they will. This type of sell's ultimate goal is to create a mood or image that will appeal to the buyer and make them want to invest their money in a product, all without the buyer realizing that this is occurring. Persistence is not as involved in a <b>soft</b> <b>sell</b> as it is in a hard sell.|$|E

50|$|Mascots or {{advertising}} {{characters are}} {{very common in}} the corporate world. Recognizable mascots include Chester Cheetah, Keebler Elf, the Fruit of the Loom Guys, Pizza Pizza Guy for Little Caesars, Rocky the Elf, the Coca-Cola Bear, the NBC Peacock, and the NRA's Eddie Eagle. These characters are typically known without even having {{to refer to the}} company or brand. This is an example of corporate branding, and <b>soft</b> <b>selling</b> a company. Mascots are able to act as brand ambassadors where advertising is not allowed. For example, many corporate mascots can attend non-profit events, or sports and promote their brand while entertaining the crowd. Some mascots are simply cartoons or virtual mascots, others are characters in commercials, and others are actually created as costumes and will appear in person in front of the public at tradeshows or events.|$|R

50|$|The {{frequency}} with which either a hard sell or a <b>soft</b> <b>sell</b> is used is dependent upon the intent of its use—the goal of advertising agencies or salespeople. There are times where hard sells are the more rational choice for a sale, and where soft sells are required.|$|E

50|$|A {{hard sell}} may {{alienate}} some customers, who find it off-putting. Sometimes the pressuring nature {{that comes along}} with hard sell tactics can overwhelm a consumer {{to the point where}} they dismiss the sales pitch or turn away from the advertisement altogether. Emotional appeal is more involved in a <b>soft</b> <b>sell</b> and with the absence of this in a hard sell, business can be lost if consumers do not respond well to the tactics, especially when times are hard. During the Great Depression, <b>soft</b> <b>sell</b> tactics, like brand relationship and humor, proved to be successful approaches when selling to consumers. People's inability to spend on luxuries required some wooing to be done in order for a sell to go through. More direct hard sell tactics pushed away already stressed, calloused minded consumers during this time period of economic hardship. There is also criticism of hard sell tactics in regards to lack of creativity on the part of advertisements and sellers, which causes the consumer to never acquire intrigue towards the product being sold.|$|E

50|$|Leo Burnett used {{dramatic}} realism in his advertising, the <b>Soft</b> <b>sell</b> {{approach to}} build brand equity. Burnett believed {{in finding the}} inherent drama of products and presenting it in advertising through warmth, shared emotions and experiences. His advertising drew from heartland-rooted values using simple, strong and instinctive imagery that talked to people. He was also known for using cultural archetypes in his copy, by creating mythical creatures that represented American values. This is evident on such campaigns as Jolly Green Giant, Tony the Tiger, Pillsbury Doughboy and more famously the Marlboro Man. Indeed these campaigns played on the 1950s attitudes towards masculinity that pervaded his campaigns.|$|E

His precise prophecy about the eradication of the dreaded ebola virus really generated an internet storm, especially with the discharge of the last known ebola patient from the hospital. Incidentally, the United Nations pronounced Nigeria ebola-free few days after that prophecy.Okafor also prophesied about the Dana air crash several months before the incident and a lot more air crashes especially those involving the Nigerian military.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of immediacy plays {{a large role}} in the concept of a hard sell and why so many advertisements and salespeople use this type of technique. Because this type of sell is so direct and blatant in nature, the consumer will most likely buy the product on the spot. A perfect example of this are mail order ads, where readers are urged to fill out a coupon right away. In opposition, a <b>soft</b> <b>sell</b> ad, because of its indirectness and subtlety, will allow for a person to have more time to make a decision {{as to whether or not}} they would like to invest their money in a product. A prime example of this type of sell would be life insurance ads where emotional appeals of family and security are mentioned. Consumers are put in a less pressured environment, allowing them to contemplate their decision on whether or not to buy a product. Immediacy is more evident in a hard sell.|$|E
