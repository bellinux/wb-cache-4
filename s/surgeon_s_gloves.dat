40|$|A new {{architecture}} for a haptic force-feedback master is proposed, {{inspired by}} the environmental constraints of motion in minimally invasive surgery. Its objective {{is to make the}} handling of the tool very intuitive for the surgeon by giving the feeling as if the <b>surgeon</b> <b>s</b> hand was inside the <b>surgeon</b> <b>s</b> body. The mechanical architecture of the master already reflects all environmental constraints in order to provide precise force-feedback. For the presented architecture the inverse and direct kinematics and the Jacobian are derived, a dexterity analysis is performed and the force transmission is computed. According to the results of the analysis, a set of geometrical parameters for the suggested architecture are proposed...|$|R

40|$|Background. The {{choice in}} between the laparoscopic lateral transabdominal (LTA) or the {{posterior}} retroperitoneoscopic (PRA) approach for adrenalectomy is usually based on <b>surgeon</b> <b>s</b> preference, rather than on objective arguments. We compared the intraoperative and postoperative outcomes of LTA and PRA {{to determine whether there}} is a preferable approach. Methods. Thirty-eight consecutive patients successfully underwent PRA for benign adrenal tumors # 6 cm. A case-control study including 38 patients who successfully underwent LTA was performed. Operative time, intraoperative ventilatory parameters (CO 2 production [VCO 2], whole body oxygen consumption, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide [PaCO 2], and arterial partial pressure of oxygen [PaO 2]), final histology, complications, postoperative stay, analgesic requirement, time to regain normal bowel function, and time to return to work were recorded and compared between the 2 groups. Results. The 2 groups did not differ in terms of operative time, analgesic requirement, time to first flatus, complication rate, duration of postoperative stay, or final histology. Patients in the LTA group showed significantly lower PaCO 2, PaO 2, and VCO 2 {{at the end of the}} operation. Patients in the PRA group experienced a significantly faster return to work. Conclusion. No procedure can be considered preferable overall. In cases of bilateral adrenalectomy and previous abdominal surgery, PRA may offer some advantages. <b>Surgeon</b> <b>s</b> preference and experience will continue to guide this choice...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{learning}} curve for robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) {{has not been}} extensively studied. We therefore evaluated the {{learning curve}} of RAPN for a fellowship-trained laparoscopic surgeon with extensive prior experience with laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN).

Patients and Methods: We prospectively evaluated 38 consecutive patients undergoing RAPN by a single <b>surgeon</b> (<b>S.</b> B. B.). Sixteen patients had tumors 2 cm. Warm ischemia times and overall operative times were recorded as indices of learning progression. Results: Average operative time for tumors 2 cm was 145. 8 minutes (131. 1 – 160. 5 minutes). The difference between the operative times for tumors 2 cm {{was not statistically significant}} (p 0. 23). Average warm ischemia time for tumors 2 cm was 24. 7 minutes (21. 3 – 28. 1 minutes).

40|$|Background: Hysterectomy is {{the most}} {{frequently}} surgery done with robotic assistance {{in the world and}} has been widely studied since its emergence. The surgical outcomes of the robotic hysterectomy are similar to those obtained with other minimally invasive hysterectomy techniques (laparoscopic and vaginal) and appear as a promising surgical technique in gynaecology surgery. The aim {{of this study was to}} observe the learning curve of robot-assisted hysterectomy in a French surgical center, and was to evaluate the impact of the surgical mentoring. Methods: We retrospectively collected the data from the files of the robot-assisted hysterectomies with the Da Vinci® Surgical System performed between March 2010 and June 2014 at the Foch hospital in Suresnes (France). We first studied the operative time according to the number of cases, independently of the surgeon to determine two periods: the initial learning phase (Phase 1) and the control of surgical skills phase (Phase 2). The phase was defined by mastering the basic surgical tasks. Secondarily we compared these two periods for operative time, blood losses, Body Mass Index (BMI), days of hospitalisations and uterine weight. We finally studied the difference of the learning curve between an experimented <b>surgeon</b> (<b>S</b> 1) who practised the first the robot-assisted hysterectomies and a less experimented <b>surgeon</b> (<b>S</b> 2) who first assisted S 1 and then operated on his own patients. Results: 154 robot-assisted hysterectomies were analysed. 20 procedures were necessary to access to the control of surgical skills phase. There was a significant decrease of the operative time between the learning phase (156. 8 minutes) compared to the control of surgical skills phase (125. 8 minutes, p= 0. 003). No difference between these two periods for blood losses, BMI, days of hospitalisations and uterine weight were demonstrated. The learning curve of S 1 showed 20 procedures to master the robot-assisted hysterectomies with a significant decrease of the operative time while the learning curve of S 2 showed no improvement in operative time with respect to case number. Conclusion: 20 robot-assisted hysterectomies are necessary to achieve control of surgical skills. The companionship to learn robotic surgery seems also promising, by improving the learning phase for this surgical technique...|$|R
