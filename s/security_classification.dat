25|$|An {{important}} aspect of information security and risk management is recognizing the value of information and defining appropriate procedures and protection requirements for the information. Not all information is equal and so not all information requires {{the same degree of}} protection. This requires information to be assigned a <b>security</b> <b>classification.</b>|$|E
25|$|The non-discretionary {{approach}} consolidates {{all access}} control under a centralized administration. The {{access to information}} and other resources is usually based on the individuals function (role) in the organization or the tasks the individual must perform. The discretionary approach gives the creator or owner of the information resource {{the ability to control}} access to those resources. In the Mandatory access control approach, access is granted or denied basing upon the <b>security</b> <b>classification</b> assigned to the information resource.|$|E

25|$|Improved {{techniques}} and facilities allowed the plant, which operated on a 48-hour week, {{with the occasional}} 51- and 54-hour week, to triple its output in 1947. By 1949, the pilot plant employed over 700 people. The lenses were initially shipped by rail, but this was inconvenient because their high <b>security</b> <b>classification</b> required armed guards. This was therefore replaced by an air transport route, with the lenses being flown in C-54 aircraft based at Fairfield-Suisun Army Air Base. On two occasions, C-54s loaded with explosives were struck by lightning, but no damage to the plane, the crew or the explosives resulted.|$|E
25|$|Generally, when {{an inmate}} {{arrives at a}} prison, they go through a <b>security</b> <b>classification</b> {{screening}} and risk assessment that determines {{where they will be}} placed within the prison system. Classifications are assigned by assessing the prisoner's personal history and criminal record, and through subjective determinations made by intake personnel (which include mental health workers, counselors, prison unit managers, and others). This process will {{have a major impact on}} the prisoner's experience, determining their security level, educational and work programs, mental health status (e.g. will they be placed in a mental health unit), and many other factors. This sorting of prisoners is one of the fundamental techniques through which the prison administration maintains control over the inmate population, and creates an orderly and secure prison environment. At most prisons, prisoners are made to wear prison uniform.|$|E

When former Vice President Dan Quayle suggested to Cheney that the office was largely ceremonial, Cheney reportedly replied, [...] "I have a different understanding with the president." [...] The articles described Cheney as having a secretive approach to the tools of government, indicated by the use of his own <b>security</b> <b>classification</b> and three man-sized safes in his offices.|$|E

2500|$|Although Israel has a {{majority}} of Jewish soldiers, all citizens including large numbers of Druze and Circassian men are subject to mandatory conscription. Originally, they served {{in the framework of}} a special unit called [...] "The Minorities' Unit", which operated until 2015 {{in the form of the}} independent Herev ("Sword") battalion. However, since the 1980s Druze soldiers have increasingly protested this practice, which they considered a means of segregating them and denying them access to elite units (like sayeret units). The army has increasingly admitted Druze soldiers to regular combat units and promoted them to higher ranks from which they had been previously excluded. In 2015 Rav Aluf Gadi Eizenkot ordered the unit's closure in order to assimilate the Druze soldiers no differently than Jewish soldiers, as part of an ongoing reorganization of the army. Several Druze officers reached ranks as high as Major General, and many received commendations for distinguished service. In proportion to their numbers, the Druze people achieve much higher—documented—levels in the Israeli army than other soldiers. Nevertheless, some Druze still charge that discrimination continues, such as exclusion from the Air Force, although the official low <b>security</b> <b>classification</b> for Druze has been abolished for some time. The first Druze aircraft navigator completed his training course in 2005; like all air force pilots, his identity is not disclosed. During the Israeli War of Independence, many Druze who had initially sided with the Arabs deserted their ranks to either return to their villages or side with Israel in various capacities.|$|E
