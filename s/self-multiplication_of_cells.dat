Based on an important property <b>of</b> <b>self-multiplication</b> <b>of</b> 0 - 1 matrix, we construct BBSM algorithm for matrix with non-overlapping biclusters and overlapping biclusters seperately, and prove that this algorithm can obtain the s most largest biclusters for both cases...|$|R

You will recall {{that the idea of}} heterogeneity (mixed-up-ness) comes in both statistical and clinical flavours. 1 This measure— (I 2) —assesses the statistical aspect. It is often to be found {{at the bottom of a}} forest plot, near some other numbers (τ 2 and χ 2). The principle of I 2 is straightforward. It gives you an idea of the ‘percentage of variation which is beyond that you’d expect by chance alone’. It can be interpreted, approximately, like this: ▸ 0 %– 25 %: just chance, really, ▸ 25 %– 50 %: bit more than just chance, but unless clinically odd, probably acceptable. With a grain of salt. ▸ 51 % plus: Woah! Really, quite different. Should you b...|$|R
40|$|Intrinsic, {{extrinsic}} (transition {{metals and}} hydroxyl), and induced (color centers) absorption of multicomponent silicate glasses in UV, visible and near JR spectral regions are described. Parasitic effects influencing absorption measurements are discussed. Excitation to the intrinsic absorption band results in intrinsic luminescence and ionization followed by color center generation and phosphorescence. The thresholds of electron and hole mobility in glass network {{are found in}} the far UV region. The hole-centers generation as a criterion of substance ionization is proposed. A number of nonlinear mechanisms of glass ionization are discussed. Two-photon ionization was detected in alkaline-silicate glasses exposed to high-power laser radiation in nano- and picosecond regimes [...] Three-photon ionization was detected in lead-silicate glasses. No reliable data on multiphoton ionization (with number of photons more than 3) of glasses are found. Two- and three-photon cooperative <b>self-multiplication</b> <b>of</b> color centers was found in CuC 1 -doped glasses. Glass matrix ionization by spectral broadening of femtosecond JR pulses is described. Thermal and surface ionization of glass under intense irradiation by pulsed lasers is described. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} Monte Carlo neutron {{calculations}} for a combined gamma/passive neutron coincidence counter has been performed. This type of detector, {{part of a}} suite of non-destructive assay instruments utilised for {{the enforcement of the}} Euratom nuclear safeguards within the European Union, is to be used for high accuracy measurements of the plutonium content of nuclear materials. The multi-purpose Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) code version 4 B has been used to model in detail the neutron coincidence detector and to investigate the leakage <b>self-multiplication</b> <b>of</b> PuO 2 and Mixed U-Pu Oxide (MOX) reference samples used to calibrate the instrument. The MCNP calculations have been used together with a neutron coincidence counting interpretative model to determine characteristic parameters of the detector. A comparative study to both experimental and previous numerical results has been performed. Sensitivity curves of the variation of the detector's efficiency, epsilon, to the (alpha,n), to spontaneous fission neutron emission rate ratio, alpha, and to the reals coincidence gate utilisation factor, fr, are presented. Once bias-corrected, the trends of the real coincidence counts rate as a function of sample mass for three types of sample could be matched within 0. 33 % of experimental results. This result confirms the possible use of MCNP to calculate response trends accurately {{for a wide variety of}} source materials, given a limited experimental calibration set. Sources of the inaccuracy in the calculations have not yet been fully investigated, because of the vast parameter space to be investigated, but values of the coincidence gate utilisation factor derived directly from the MCNP data have been found to be overestimated by about 8. 2 %.

For pH triggered release <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> from the composite microcapsules, the rate constant <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> release depends on the swelling/dissolution rate of the shellac matrix and varies with the pH of the aqueous media.
