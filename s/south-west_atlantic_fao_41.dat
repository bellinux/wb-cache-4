40|$|Aim Pelagic seabirds exploit {{large areas}} of ocean when acting as central-place foragers during the {{breeding}} season, and ranges are even more extensive outside the breeding period. Spatial niche partitioning is known to occur among species that breed sympatrically, but is less apparent during the non-breeding period when there is increased potential for overlap among closely related species from neighbouring island groups. This applies to several species of prion, Pachyptila spp., in the Southern Ocean; although extremely abundant, their at-sea distribution was virtually unknown because they are difficult to distinguish while at sea. To understand spatial niche partitioning at large scales, we investigated the year-round distribution of thin-billed prions (Pachyptila belcheri) from the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) and Antarctic prions (Pachyptila desolata) from South Georgia.

The distribution and relative abundance of I. argentinus in the Falkland Islands fishery was examined for the period 1989 – 96. Three consistent areas of high abundance were observed to the north-east (shelf-break region) and north-west (shelf region) of the islands, and close to the northern coast of East Falkland. Areas of high sea surface temperature gradients (thermal gradients) extracted from remotely sensed satellite images were used as an indicator of mesoscale oceanographic activity and compared with the location of the fishery. I. argentinus were found to be associated with areas of thermal gradients, commonly seen at the interface of Falkland Current and Patagonian shelf waters.

Here, we aimed to describe their spatio-temporal distribution and abundance in relation to wave exposure in the intertidal rocky shores of the <b>south-west</b> <b>Atlantic</b> to provide a basis for further understanding of ecological processes in this system. The abundance and composition of the functional groups of sessile organisms and sedentary consumers were taken by sampling the intertidal of sheltered and moderately exposed shores during a period of one year. The sublittoral fringe of sheltered areas was dominated by macroalgae, while the low midlittoral was dominated by bare rock and barnacles. In contrast, filter-feeding animals prevailed at exposed shores, probably explaining the higher abundance of the predator Stramonita haemastoma at these locations. Limpets were more abundant at the midlittoral zone of all shores while sea urchins were exclusively found at the sublittoral fringe of moderately exposed shores, therefore, adding grazing pressure on these areas. The results showed patterns of coexistence, distribution and abundance of those organisms in this subtropical area, presumably as a result of wave action, competition and prey availability.

40|$|Two {{mesoscale}} net sampling {{surveys were}} conducted in the <b>south-west</b> <b>Atlantic</b> between 34 ° and 55 °S. The first survey was in the austral spring of 1990 and used both an RMT 8 net which was trawled obliquely down to 200 or 300 m and caught mainly macrozooplankton and a Bongo net which was deployed at the surface and sampled mesozooplankton. The second survey was in the austral spring of 1991 and used a Bongo net which was deployed obliquely down to 50 m and sampled mesozooplankton. This thesis considers the species composition and abundance of these samples and {{represents one of the}} first insights into the mesoscale biogeography of zooplankton communities in the <b>south-west</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> 155 species from 9 taxonomic groups were considered including euphausiids, hyperiid amphipods, chaetognaths, salps, siphonophores, and nektonic/planktonic fish. Multivariate analyses were used to highlight species assemblage distribution patterns and determine strongly correlated environmental variables. In the 1990 RMT 8 samples, species assemblages showed a distribution pattern related to the location of water masses, which was reflected in a combination of water mass and latitude being the most strongly correlated environmental variables. In the 1990 Bongo samples, a combination of seasurface temperature and latitude were most strongly correlated environmental variables and different species assemblages showed a pattern of being located in exclusive temperature ranges. The two sample sets did exhibit some common distribution patterns especially in the warm, sub-tropical waters to the north and the Falkland Shelf to the south. However, there were fundamental differences in the mid-latitudes regions, possibly reflecting the reduced ability of larvae to counteract expatriating forces when compared with adults. Further comparisons made between the 1990 and 1991 Bongo sample sets highlighted some of the causal factors behind distribution patterns. For instance, the precise definition of the boundary between sub-tropical and sub-Antarctic assemblages by the 17. 3 °C isotherm despite the multitude of expatriating phenomena suggested that many organisms were at the edge of their physiological limits in this region. In polar waters, distribution patterns were consistent but temperatures variable suggesting that advection rather than temperature tolerance was more influential. Further data from Montu (1977) and the Discovery Investigations was examined to add a seasonal dimension to the above patterns as well as providing an insight into the importance of population ecology on community distribution. Studies were concentrated on euphausiid species from which it was apparent that size structure and species dominance changed considerably with season. Estimates of the productivity of these species showed that weight-specific rates were comparable with more sub-tropical regions despite biomass levels being proportionally low. The use of satellite thermal images for predicting faunal distribution patterns was assessed with respect to future biogeographic analysis of this region. Images were a good predictor at the sub-tropical boundary but a poor predictor in other regions highlighting the fact that in situ net sampling methods still appear to be the most effective and reliable investigative tools for biogeographic analysis...|$|R

Up to now, we have only cursory information about krill's genomic plasticity to cope with the ongoing environmental changes induced by anthropogenic CO 2 emission. The genome of krill is not yet available due to its large size (about 48 Gbp).

40|$|The {{population}} of wandering albatrosses Diomedea exulans at South Georgia is decreasing because of bycatch in longline fisheries. Until {{at least the}} early 1990 s, the survival rate of females was lower than males, consistent with the adult female-biased bycatch reported for fisheries operating around the Brazil-Falklands Confluence (BFC). Here we use extensive tracking data (1990 – 2012) from breeding birds at South Georgia to investigate overlap with longline fishing effort reported to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Using data from multiple years, we conclude that breeding females are at higher risk than males from all the main pelagic longline fleets in the <b>south-west</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> Our overlap index (based on fishing effort and bird distributions) correlated positively with numbers of ringed birds reported dead on longliners, indicating that the metric was a good proxy of bycatch risk. The consistent sex bias in overlap across years, and the likely resulting sex-biased mortality, could account for lower adult female survival rate at the colony. The risk from fisheries changed seasonally; both sexes overlapped with pelagic longline effort during incubation (January–March), and particularly during post-brood chick-rearing (May–December), whereas overlap was negligible during brooding (April). The highest percentage of overlap was with the Taiwanese fleet, then vessels flagged to Brazil, Uruguay, Spain, Japan and Portugal. Females were consistently at greatest risk in the BFC region, whereas males showed lower and more variable levels of overlap with fisheries from 35 to 45 °S.
