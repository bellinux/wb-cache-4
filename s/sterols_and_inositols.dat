40|$|SummaryAttachment of {{lipophilic}} {{groups is}} a widespread modification that occurs on nearly 1, 000 proteins of diverse structure and function. At least five different types of lipids can be covalently attached to proteins: fatty acids, isoprenoids, <b>sterols,</b> phospholipids, <b>and</b> glycosylphosphatidyl <b>inositol</b> (GPI) anchors. Proteins can contain more than one type of lipid, e. g. myristate + palmitate, palmitate + cholesterol, or farnesyl + palmitate. An important principle derived from studies of lipid-modified proteins is that not all fat is the same. Each type of lipid moiety is attached by a different lipid transferase and each modification confers distinct properties to the modified protein. The most common outcome of lipid modification is an increased affinity for membranes. However, attachment of myristoyl or prenyl groups can also promote intramolecular and intermolecular protein–protein interactions. Another key concept is reversibility. The covalent linkage between a protein and either thioester-linked palmitate or a GPI anchor can be broken {{by the actions of}} thioesterases and phospholipases, respectively. By contrast, neither myristate nor the isoprenoids farnesyl or geranylgeranyl are physically removed from a modified protein. Instead, Mother Nature has devised a clever means for some proteins to sequester these lipophilic groups within a hydrophobic cleft, effectively shielding them from the aqueous milieu. Here, I provide an overview of the structural and functional consequences for proteins containing each type of lipid modification (depicted in Figure 1) ...|$|R

The dose–response relationship for this effect has been evaluated in several meta-analyses by calculating averages for different dose ranges or by applying continuous dose–response functions. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. So far, the calculation of averages for different dose ranges has not been done for plant <b>sterols</b> <b>and</b> stanols separately. The objective of the present meta-analysis {{was to investigate the}} combined and separate effects of plant <b>sterols</b> <b>and</b> stanols when classified into different dose ranges. Studies were searched and selected based on predefined criteria. Relevant data were extracted. Average LDL-cholesterol effects were calculated when studies were categorised by dose, according to random-effects models while using the variance as weighing factor. This was done for plant <b>sterols</b> <b>and</b> stanols combined and separately. In total, 124 studies (201 strata) were included. Plant <b>sterols</b> <b>and</b> stanols were administered in 129 and fifty-nine strata, respect-ively; the remaining used a mix of both. The average PS dose was 2 · 1 (range 0 · 2 – 9 · 0) g/d.

Cells were labeled with [3 H]acetate, and plasma membrane fractions were isolated under conditions that minimize the nonspecific exchange of lipids between subcellular membrane fractions. <b>Sterols</b> <b>and</b> phospholipids were purified from both whole-cell homogenates and isolated plasma membrane. In whole cells, 3 H-labeled lipids were formed, with no apparent time lag, in a linear manner up to 1 hr. Labeled <b>sterol</b> <b>and</b> phospholipids appeared in the plasma membrane, after a 30 -min lag, at approximately the same rate. However, the ratio of newly synthesized sterol to phospholipid was significantly enriched in the plasma membrane relative to the whole cell, even at the earlier time points. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that <b>sterols</b> <b>and</b> phospholipids are turned over in the plasma membrane with similar, rather short half-lives. The results of these studies suggest that, although <b>sterols</b> <b>and</b> phospholipids are transported to the cell surface with similar kinetics, some sorting of the lipids must occur {{at an early stage}} in membrane biogenesis.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} {{to examine the effects of}} plant <b>sterols</b> <b>and</b> glucomannan on lipid profiles, plasma plant <b>sterol</b> levels <b>and</b> glycemic control in mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects. Thirteen type 2 diabetic and sixteen non-diabetic individuals participated in a randomized crossover trial consisting of 4 phases, of 21 days each. During the study period, subjects were supplemented with plant sterols and/or glucomannan. Overall reductions of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations were greater after consumption of plant <b>sterols</b> <b>and</b> glucomannan compared to plant sterol or glucomannan supplementation alone. Plasma lathosterol levels, indicators of cholesterol biosynthesis, were decreased after combination treatment. The results suggest that a combination of glucomannan <b>and</b> plant <b>sterols</b> substantially improve plasma lipids by reducing cholesterol absorption and synthesis simultaneously.

40|$|High serum LDL {{cholesterol}} {{concentration is}} a major risk factor for cardiovascular complications. This risk can be lowered by diet. In this respect foods containing plant sterol or stanol esters can be useful for mildly- and hypercholesteraemic subjects. Plant <b>sterols</b> <b>and</b> stanols, which are structurally related to cholesterol, decrease the incorporation of dietary and biliary cholesterol into micelles. This lowers cholesterol absorption. Furthermore, these components increase ABC-transporter expression, which may {{also contribute to the}} decreased cholesterol absorption. Consequently, cholesterol synthesis and LDL receptor activity increase, which ultimately leads to decreased serum LDL cholesterol concentrations. Animal studies have further shown that these dietary components may also lower atherosclerotic lesion development. Plant <b>sterols</b> <b>and</b> stanols also lower plasma lipid-standardized concentrations of the hydrocarbon carotenoids, but not those of the oxygenated cartenoids and tocopherols. Also, vitamin A and D concentrations are not affected. Although absorption of plant <b>sterols</b> <b>and</b> stanols (0. 02 - 3. 5 %) is low compared to cholesterol (35 - 70 %), small amounts are found in the circulation and may influence other physiological functions. However, there is no consistent evidence that plant sterols or stanols can change the risk of colon or prostate cancer, or immune status. In conclusion, plant <b>sterols</b> <b>and</b> stanols effectively reduce serum LDL cholesterol and atherosclerotic risk.

40|$|Dietary supplementation with plant <b>sterols,</b> stanols, <b>and</b> {{their esters}} reduces {{intestinal}} cholesterol absorption, thus lowering plasma LDL cholesterol concentration in humans.

Male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed a purified diet (control), diets containing cholesterol (0. 12 g/ 100 g) only, or in combination with either plant sterols or stanols (0. 5 g/ 100 g) for 4 wk. Plant <b>sterols</b> <b>and</b> stanols dramatically increased neutral fecal sterol excretion (2. 2 and 1. 4 -fold, respectively, compared with cholesterol-fed mice; P < 0. 05). Cholesterol and cholesterol ester concentrations were higher in livers of mice fed cholesterol compared with controls (+ 135 % and + 925 %; P < 0. 05).
