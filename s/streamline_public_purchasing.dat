It is a single case study and the municipality is studied through economic theories concerning regional growth in the period of 1997 - 2007. The aim is to analyse whether these theories, such as Åke E. Anderssons and Ulf Strömquists K-society, and other more or less microeconomic assumptions, also are applicable in smaller local contexts. The aim is fulfilled through a mix of text analyses, interviews with leading politicians, civil servants and executives, together with definitions of several quantitative characteristics of economic and social growth. Alternative theories in the thesis concern identity, trust and social capital. Seven independent variables are studied: infrastructure, economic and commercial policy, steering by goals, <b>streamlining,</b> <b>public</b> <b>purchase,</b> marketing and higher education. The results show that while Örnsköldsvik has experienced an extraordinary economic growth, the social growth lags behind. The conclusion is therefore, that economic theories are not enough to explain both economic and social growth at the municipality level. This strengthens the assumption that the explanation to municipal growth in reality lays in the local forces.

Indeed, the public sector can influence green procurement both by designing suitable policies and by driving “green” markets through the significant share of <b>public</b> <b>purchases</b> on GDP. The European Commission (EC) has {{emphasized the importance of}} cost-efficient GPP and, in compliance with the EU’s Integrated Product Policy (IPC), Member States have been encouraged to devise national action plans. As a result, many countries have already adopted steps in the direction of greening <b>public</b> <b>purchases.</b> The aim of our paper is twofold: first, we focus {{on the state of the}} art in terms of the EU and Italian Legislation; then, we highlight open questions related to crucial issues in GPP implementation, with a particular attention to the design of green tenders and awarding criteria to account for environmental quality in <b>public</b> <b>purchasing</b> procedures. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The paper studies {{capture and}} {{extortion}} in <b>public</b> <b>purchase.</b> It shows that capture yields a dead-weight loss while extortion does not. Based on the calibration {{of the model}} {{the total cost of}} capture is between 1. 2 and 2. 88 times the amount of the bribes. The theoretical analysis focuses on capture fight. The legal framework that emerges from the normative analysis involves open tender for larger purchases and no monitoring for the smaller ones. The rule is independent of a country’s characteristics. Large <b>public</b> <b>purchases</b> should hence be ruled by international legislation. For markets of medium range national legislation differs. When susceptibility to corruption rises, there is a shift from the capture to the extortion regime...|$|R
40|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{national}} public procurement policy, a plethora of rules and procedures govern <b>public</b> <b>purchase</b> practices of federal and sub-federal government entities including public sector enterprises (PSEs) in India. While these norms generally follow international best practices, their implementation falls short in providing transparency, accountability, efficiency and professionalism in the award of public contracts. With mandatory e-tendering of federal, sub-federal and PSE contracts already in place, enacting the lapsed Public Procurement Bill 2012, which inter alia provides for an independent dispute resolution mechanism and integrating states within a national procurement policy would complete the set of reforms needed to usher in transparency and efficiency in <b>public</b> <b>purchases</b> and internationalise the country’s government procurement regulation...|$|R
