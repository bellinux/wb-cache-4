5|$|Hurricane Kyle was the {{eleventh}} tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed from a strong tropical disturbance that tracked across the northeastern Caribbean Sea {{in the third}} week of September. As a low pressure area, it moved <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, dumping torrential rains across those islands.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane {{warnings}} {{were put}} in effect for six provinces in southeastern Cuba, where significant precipitation ranging up to 20inches (500mm) across the mountainous south was expected {{as the center of}} Ernesto tracked <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> Cuba. Cuban officials evacuated 300,000people and brought its fishing fleet into harbors. The Cuban state television broadcast extensive warnings about the storm, urging precautions. Cattle were moved to higher ground, tourists were evacuated from hotels in the southeastern province of Granma, and baseball games scheduled for the evening of August 27 in Havana were played earlier in the day. The threat of the storm caused domestic flights to be canceled.|$|E

5|$|A transit of Venus {{across the}} Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes {{directly}} between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence obscuring {{a small portion}} of) the solar disk. During a transit, Venus {{can be seen from}} Earth as a small black disk moving across the face of the Sun. The duration of such transits is usually several hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes). A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of Venus is more than 3 times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> the face of the Sun, because it is much farther away from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Betsy was {{the strongest}} and most devastating storm of the season. Extensive damage from Betsy was {{reported}} in the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana, particularly the New Orleans area. It was the first hurricane {{in the history of the}} United States to result in at least $1billion (1965USD) in losses. Hurricane Carol meandered in the eastern Atlantic for over two weeks from mid-September to very early October. Impact on land from Carol was minimal. In late September, Tropical Storm Debbie developed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea and moved <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> the region, before later reaching the Gulf of Mexico. The storm dissipated just offshore of Louisiana, which resulted in only minor impact along the Gulf Coast of the United States. The final tropical cyclone, Hurricane Elena, formed on October12. Elena remained at sea for nearly a week and caused no damage on land. Collectively, the storms of the 1965Atlantic hurricane season caused 76fatalities and $1.45billion in damage, almost entirely due to Hurricane Betsy.|$|E
5|$|Late on October29, Mitch {{weakened}} to {{tropical storm}} status. It moved <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> Honduras, {{turning to the}} west. The large circulation dropped heavy rainfall throughout Central America, particularly in Honduras and Nicaragua, causing widespread flooding. While over land, Mitch initially maintained an area of deep convection, which allowed it to maintain tropical storm force winds. On October31, the circulation became poorly defined while moving over increasingly mountainous terrain; however, the strongest convection persisted over the adjacent Pacific Ocean, and the NHC noted the potential for Mitch to become a Pacific tropical cyclone. Later that day, Mitch weakened into a tropical depression near the border of Guatemala and Honduras. An approaching trough weakened the ridge in the western Gulf of Mexico, allowing Mitch to make the long-intended turn to the northwest. Convection gradually diminished, and the surface circulation of Mitch dissipated on November1 near the border of Mexico and Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|Sand dunes are accumulations of {{windblown sand}} {{piled up in}} mounds or ridges. They form {{downwind}} of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle. As the wind blows, saltation and creep {{take place on the}} windward side of the dune and individual grains of sand move uphill. When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side. The upwind slope typically has a gradient of 10° to 20° while the lee slope is around 32°, the angle at which loose dry sand will slip. As this wind-induced movement of sand grains takes place, the dune moves <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> the surface of the ground. Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields. When these are extensive, they are known as sand seas or ergs.|$|E
5|$|The season's eighteenth {{tropical}} depression formed over the Turks and Caicos Islands on September 18. Later that day, {{it became the}} seventeenth tropical storm of the season. Rita slowly intensified to become a hurricane on September 20. It was at Category1 and later Category2 intensity as it moved south of the Florida Keys. Rapid intensification ensued as Rita moved into the Gulf of Mexico on September 20, and Rita became a Category5 hurricane on September 21, becoming {{at the time the}} third-most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Basin with a minimum central pressure of 895mbar, though it would later fall to fourth following Hurricane Wilma. However, as the storm moved <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> the Gulf of Mexico it gradually weakened until landfall. Rita made landfall as a strong Category3 hurricane in Cameron Parish, Louisiana near the Texas/Louisiana border on September 24, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Tracking <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> {{the center}} of the island, the intense inner rainbands dropped heavy {{rainfall}} which peaked at 650mm (25.61in) at the University of Guam. The precipitation led to record river flow on the Pago and Asan Rivers; overflown rivers caused damage to some roads and bridges. The rainfall also caused extensive flooding in several villages. Pongsona produced a storm surge of up to 6m (20ft) at some locations, with 3– 4m (9– 13ft) recorded near the eyewall. Considerable storm surge flooding occurred from Tumon southward to Piti, leaving some buildings on the west coast of the island flooded with 1m (4ft) of water. The combination of strong storm surge and rough waves caused considerable beach erosion and severe coastal damage.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} peak winds, Tropical Storm Chantal became disorganized {{while the}} center became ill-defined and situated to the west-southwest {{of the main}} area of convection; {{this was due to}} unfavorable upper-level winds, although computer models continued to forecast a more favorable upper-level environment. By early on August20, Hurricane Hunters reported several low-level circulations embedded within a large low pressure area. Later that day, wind shear decreased when the storm moved into the Gulf of Honduras. Chantal became much better organized, again reaching peak winds of 70miles per hour (110km/h) before making landfall early on August21 near the border of Mexico and Belize. Initially, the storm was forecast to cross the Yucatán Peninsula and Bay of Campeche and make a second landfall in the state of Veracruz. Chantal slowly weakened over land while moving <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> northern Belize. Convection decreased markedly late on August21, and early the next day Chantal weakened to tropical depression status. The upper- and middle-level circulations turned to the northeast while the low-level circulation turned to the west-southwest further inland. Weakening continued, and late on August22 Chantal dissipated over the Mexican state of Tabasco.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Iris was {{the ninth}} named storm and fifth {{hurricane}} of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. Iris {{was the first}} of three tropical cyclones to affect the Lesser Antilles in a three-week period, preceding the more destructive hurricanes Luis and Marilyn. It developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles on August22 and attained hurricane status within 30hours. The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm before crossing the islands of the eastern Caribbean from August26 through August28. During that time, Iris became one of four active tropical storms in the Atlantic basin. Earlier it had interacted with Hurricane Humberto, and beginning on August30, Iris interacted with Tropical Storm Karen. Iris re-intensified into a hurricane and attained peak sustained winds of 110mph (175km/h) while moving <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> the central Atlantic. The hurricane accelerated to the north and absorbed a dissipating Tropical Depression Karen on September3. Iris weakened to a tropical storm and became extratropical on September4, though its remnants reattained hurricane-force winds before affecting western Europe on September7.|$|E
5|$|Most polar {{molecules}} {{have low}} solubility in the hydrocarbon {{core of a}} lipid bilayer and, as a consequence, have low permeability coefficients across the bilayer. This effect is particularly pronounced for charged species, which have even lower permeability coefficients than neutral polar molecules. Anions typically have {{a higher rate of}} diffusion through bilayers than cations. Compared to ions, water molecules actually have a relatively large permeability through the bilayer, as evidenced by osmotic swelling. When a cell or vesicle with a high interior salt concentration is placed in a solution with a low salt concentration it will swell and eventually burst. Such a result would not be observed unless water was able to pass through the bilayer with relative ease. The anomalously large permeability of water through bilayers is still not completely understood and continues to be the subject of active debate. Small uncharged apolar molecules diffuse through lipid bilayers many orders of magnitude faster than ions or water. This applies both to fats and organic solvents like chloroform and ether. Regardless of their polar character larger molecules diffuse more <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> lipid bilayers than small molecules.|$|E

5|$|The {{geographical}} {{range of the}} quagga {{does not appear to}} extend to the northward of the river Vaal. The animal was formerly extremely common within the colony; but, vanishing before the strides of civilisation, is now to be found in very limited numbers and on the borders only. Beyond, on those sultry plains which are completely taken possession of by wild beasts, and may with strict propriety be termed the domains of savage nature, it occurs in interminable herds; and, although never intermixing with its more elegant congeners, it is almost invariably to be found ranging with the white-tailed gnu and with the ostrich, for the society of which bird especially it evinces the most singular predilection. Moving <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> the profile of the ocean-like horizon, uttering a shrill, barking neigh, of which its name forms a correct imitation, long files of quaggas continually remind the early traveller of a rival caravan on its march. Bands of many hundreds are thus frequently seen doing their migration from the dreary and desolate plains of some portion of the interior, which has formed their secluded abode, seeking for those more luxuriant pastures where, during the summer months, various herbs thrust forth their leaves and flowers to form a green carpet, spangled with hues the most brilliant and diversified.|$|E

25|$|With the {{development}} of the railways and better transportation links, the game of cricket began to spread <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> Wales and by the 1830s the first interclub fixtures were regularly played. On 5 May 1845, Cardiff Cricket Club was inaugurated, and after three years using the rented field at Longcross, now the location of the Cardiff Royal Infirmary, the team became associated with the Cardiff Arms Park. Both the Arms Park and St. Helen's, in Swansea were cricket venues before they became associated with rugby union. By 1850 cricket had become a popular activity in many schools, and this in turn helped cricket to be adopted as a working-class sport rather than one associated with the gentry as it occurred in England.|$|E

No siege guns were immediately available, but a large convoy with heavy artillery was plodding <b>slowly</b> <b>across</b> Spain. But Junot was too impatient to wait for it. Anxious to erase the stain of his defeat at Vimeiro, Junot obtained Spanish fortress guns from Burgos and Segovia to form his own siege train. On 15 March he directed his troops to march on Astorga. Clausel's division began the Siege of Astorga on 21 March while Saint-Croix's dragoons covered the siege from La Bañeza and Solignac supported the operation from León and Benavente. Because the guns had not arrived, Clausel's men occupied themselves by digging the first parallel and preparing artillery positions.|$|E
