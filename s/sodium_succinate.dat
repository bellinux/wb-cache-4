The task of research is to ascertain changes that take place in functional state of sportsmen during long physical loadings and optimization of the work of cardiovascular system (CVS) and prophylaxis of psychical strains with the help of <b>succinate</b> <b>sodium.</b> Methods and organization of research. There were examined 84 sportsmen to ascertain changes that take place in the functional state of sportsmen during the long physical loadings and optimization of the work of CVS with the help of <b>succinate</b> <b>sodium.</b> Examinations took place during the training sessions (TS) in January, February and July 2012 - 2013 years. Results of research and its discussion. There was studied an efficiency of the course use of <b>succinate</b> <b>sodium</b> in footballers 100 mg 3 times a day during 14 days. Energetic supply of processes of intracellular homeostasis in erythrocytes realizes by means of ATP that is created in the process of glycolysis. According to the results of research after course prescription of <b>succinate</b> <b>sodium</b> in sportsmen the content of ATP in erythrocytes increased and an amount of ADP and AMP decreased. An improvement of general metabolic situation under an influence of <b>succinate</b> <b>sodium</b> was proved by the decrease of products of reactions of peroxidation in blood plasma of footballers. These results indicated an essential antiacidotic effect of the course use of <b>succinate</b> <b>sodium</b> by footballers after loading in anaerobic and glycolytic zone of intensity. At the same time there was ascertain in our research that the use of <b>succinate</b> <b>sodium</b> had a positive effect on the dynamics of lactate content during the processes of renewal after training in aerobic-anaerobic (85 - 90 %intensity) and anaerobic (90 - 100 % intensity) zones of preparation. The results of analyses of sportsmen who took <b>succinate</b> <b>sodium</b> had essentially lower level of enzymes activity than indicators of sportsmen who did not take this preparation. Indicators of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alaninaminotransferata (АLТ) were lower than at the beginning of TS. The received results indicated the stabilization of membranes of the cells of liver that consequently proved hepatoprotective effect of succinate. As under an influence of <b>succinate</b> <b>sodium</b> the speed of utilization of lactate accelerates so its course prescription favors an increase of oxygen flow capacity of arterial blood and the rise of transport capacity of O 2 into tissues. The use of <b>succinate</b> <b>sodium</b> improves the work of adaptive mechanisms during the training and increases anti-stress effect. An assessment of the functional state of CVS on indicators of systolic and diastolic arterial pressure (AP syst, AP diast), pulse pressure (PP) and heart rate demonstrated that at the use of <b>succinate</b> <b>sodium</b> the aforesaid indicators of the footballers at the end of TS did not differ from the ones at the beginning of session. According to the results of research the course use of <b>succinate</b> <b>sodium</b> led to an essential growth of general force of cardiointervals spectrum. The spectral force increased in diapasons of the high (HF) and low frequencies (LF), and an indicator LF/HF decreased (84, 9 % versus 139 % indicators of footballers who did not take <b>succinate</b> <b>sodium)</b> and was even lower than at the beginning of TS. Footballers who underwent the course prescription of <b>succinate</b> <b>sodium</b> noticed: an absence of signs of overstrain or overtraining; the rise of desire to train; the rise of the level of physical and psychical capacity for work and sport effectiveness. Conclusions. Metabotropic preparations are an important reserve for improvement the functional state of organism of sportsmen during the training in different zones of intensity. There was ascertained that course use of <b>succinate</b> <b>sodium</b> had a positive effect for metabolism, cytoarchitecture and functional abilities of erythrocytes. Normalization of indicators of the mean size of aggregate, indicator of aggregation and percent of unaggregated erythrocytes indicated an improvement of the state aggregative activity of erythrocytes, and the changes of rigidity index of erythrocytes indicated an improvement of its ability to deformation. The decrease of erythrocytes aggregation and normalization of its ability to deformation {{have a positive effect on}} rheological properties of blood and therefore lead to an improvement of blood circulation in microvessels and normalization of tissue metabolism. High physical activity and low fatigability; normal sleep and appetite; absence of transient attacks of head ache, unmotivated changes of mood, irritation and so on indicated an improvement of the general state of sportsmen who underwent the course prescription of <b>succinate</b> <b>sodium</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the anion-controlled drug release mechanism through the cationic coating polymer Eudragit RS 30 D as a function of the anion attraction toward the polymer’s quarternary ammonium group (QAG), anion valence, and film composition.

The mechanism of drug release involved an immediate penetration of dissolution medium into the polymer followed by an instant exchange of chloride against the medium’s anion species at completely different rates compared with the drug release. Dependent on the attraction of the anion toward the QAGs, a water flux was induced by back and forth exchanging anions. Strong attraction (nitrate, sulfate) resulted in a low water flux while weak attraction resulted in a high flux (acetate, succinic acid). The water flux increased at increasing number of QAGs.

High levels of succinate transport occurred when cells were grown on succinate, fumarate, or malate, whereas low activity was found when cells were grown on glucose, sucrose, arabinose, or pyruvate {{as the sole}} carbon source. Because of the rapid metabolism of succinate after transport into the cells, a succinate dehydrogenase-deficient mutant was isolated in which intracellular succinate accumulated to over 400 times the external concentration. Succinate transport was completely abolished {{in the presence of}} metabolic uncouplers but was relatively insensitive to <b>sodium</b> arsenate. <b>Succinate</b> transport was a saturable function of the succinate concentration, and the apparent Km and Vmax values for transport were determined in both the parent and the succinate dehydrogenase mutant.

O M sodium nitrite solution saturated with crystalline sodium nitrate with sodium hydroxide concentrations ranging from 0. 1 M to 2. 0 M. The solubilities of sodium butyrate and trisodium N-(2 -hydroxyethyl) ethylene- diaminetriacetate in both types of HLW tank supernate solutions were high over the temperature and sodium hydroxide concentration ranges expected in the tanks. The solubilities of these compounds are similar (in terms of total organic carbon) to <b>sodium</b> glycolate, <b>succinate,</b> caproate, dibutylphosphate, citrate, formate, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, and nitrilotriacetate which were measured previously. High solubilities will prevent solid sodium salts of these organic acids from precipitating from tank supernate solutions. The total organic carbon concentrations (TOC) of actual tank supernates are generaly much lower than the TOC ranges for the simulated supernate solutions saturated (at the solubility limit) with the organic salts. This is true even if all the dissolved carbon in a given tank supernate is due to only one of these eight soluble compounds (an unlikely situation). Solubilities of all the organic salts decrease with increasing sodium hydoxide and sodium nitrate concentration because of the common ion effect of Na{sup +}. Increasing temperatures has little effect on the solubilities of sodium butyrate and trisodium N-(2 -hydroxyethyl) ethylenediaminetriacetate...|$|R
40|$|The {{catalytic}} {{wet oxidation}} (WO) mechanisms for the salts of organics, particularly carboxylic acids, in highly alkaline solution are of prime importance {{from the viewpoint}} of alumina producers because organic contaminants have adverse effects on the alumina refining process. Four organic compounds of interest, which are found in several worldwide alumina process liquors (Bayer liquor), are sodium acetate, oxalate, malonate, and succinate. CuO-catalyzed WO of the aforementioned organic salts was studied in an alumina process liquor (Bayer liquor) and synthetic Bayer liquor. CuO was found to catalyze the WO of only one of the organic salts, sodium malonate, in isolation in synthetic Bayer liquor at low temperature (165 degreesC). In Bayer liquor, however, both sodium malonate and <b>sodium</b> <b>succinate</b> underwent CuO-catalyzed WO at 165 degreesC. <b>Sodium</b> <b>succinate</b> was found to undergo CuO-catalyzed WO at 165 degreesC in Bayer liquor via a co-oxidation mechanism. Sodium malonate was identified as a compound capable of co-oxidizing <b>sodium</b> <b>succinate</b> under Bayer-like (highly alkaline) conditions. Sodium malonate was also found to be capable of co-oxidizing sodium acetate under Bayer-like conditions, indicating that highly reactive free-radical intermediates are formed during CuO-catalyzed WO of sodium malonate...|$|E
40|$|Effect of ATP and {{substrates}} on 2, 4 -dinitrophenol-induced adenosine triphcsphatase (E.

The oxidation of <b>sodium</b> <b>succinate</b> inhibited {{the action of}} 2, 4 -DNP on the induction of adenosine triphosphatase activity in the mitochondria. 2. A moderately large amount of <b>sodium</b> <b>succinate</b> restored the suppressed mitochondrial respiration due to 2, 4 -DNP. 3. Adenosine- 5 '-triphosphate (ATP) restored quantitatively the released and inhibited mitochondrial respiration due to 2, 4 -DNP, and its prior addition prevented also quantitatively the action of 2, 4 -DNP on the mitochondrial oxygen up-take. These ATP effects were oligomycin sensitive, and they were considered to manifest their actions through the phosphorylation system. </p...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{protective}} effects of nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSA-IDs) and steroids on seroma formation after mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection in rats. Methods: Mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection were applied to the rats. Thirty rats enrolled in the study were randomly divided into three groups of 10 each. Group I patients received physiological serum, whereas groups II and III received 30 mgr/kg methylprednisolone <b>sodium</b> <b>succinate</b> and 0. 2 mgr/kg meloxicam, respectively. All groups received the local drug applications into the potential space beneath axillary and pectoral flap before skin and subcutaneous tissue were closed. After 7 th day of mastectomy, the seroma volumes were measured in groups and the rats were sacrificed. Results: The seroma amount showed significant increase (p< 0. 05) in group 1 when compared to group 2 and 3. However no significant differences were observed between group 2 and group 3. The postoperative infection rate was 40 percent in group 2. Conclusion: It was concluded that methylprednisolone <b>sodium</b> <b>succinate</b> and meloxicam were effective on the seroma formed after radical mastectomy and axillary dissection. However, due to the high risk of wound infection of methyl prednisolone <b>sodium</b> <b>succinate,</b> this should not been preferred...|$|E

For combination of naproxen and esomeprazole a simple, economic and sensitive HPLC method was described for the concurrent determination of naproxen and esomeprazole in pharmaceutical formulations. Isocratic chromatography was performed with C- 18 column and mixture of phosphate buffer (pH 6. 1) and acetonitrile in ratio of (40 : 60, v/v) at 1. 5 mL min- 1. The eluents were monitored at 302 nm using UV detector. The method was isocratic in the range of 9. 38 to 300 Æ’ÃŠg mL- 1 for naproxen and 0. 5 to 16 Æ’ÃŠg mL- 1 for esomeprazole.
