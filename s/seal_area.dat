50|$|The {{elliptic}} chamber {{is called}} a 'cam ring' by the industry. As a vane moves into, say, a maximum extension, and then rotates into a minimum extension region of the cam ring, it passes through a gradual transition from maximum to minimum followed by a gradual transitionback to maximum and this happens twice per revolution. In order to prevent oil under pressure from bypassing the vanes, 4 sealing areasare created by means of 4 kidney shaped ports located in the transition areas between minimum and maximum. The spaces between the kidney ports are called the <b>sealing</b> <b>areas</b> and this port system is located at either, or both axial ends of the rotor and vanes. The configuration of the ports and <b>sealing</b> <b>areas</b> are such that the space between any two adjacent vanes is slightly less than the coverage ofthe <b>sealing</b> <b>area.</b> In other words, as the vanes rotate through the <b>sealing</b> <b>area,</b> for {{a small amount of}} rotation, both adjacent vanes arewithin the <b>sealing</b> <b>area.</b> As the rotation continues, the first vane in line leaves the <b>sealing</b> <b>area,</b> but not before the next vane in succession is firmly in the sealing region.|$|R
40|$|A fatal {{explosion}} in a <b>sealed</b> <b>area</b> at the Sago Mine in 2006 prompted researchers and regulators in the United States to re-examine {{the requirements for}} explosion-resistant mine seals. Seals are used in underground coal mines to isolate abandoned mining areas from active workings. Prior to the Sago disaster, mining regulations required seals to withstand a 140 kPa explosion pressure. Recent research at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Pittsburgh Research Laboratory showed that pressures from explosions can far exceed this pressure. U. S. mining regulations now require much stronger seals. Current research focuses on understanding the science, engineering and management of <b>sealed</b> <b>areas</b> of coal mines. Scientific efforts seek understanding of how explosive methane-air mixtures accumulate using measurements and models of the <b>sealed</b> <b>area</b> atmosphere. Additional scientific efforts aim to understand the explosion pressures that can develop {{using a combination of}} numerical modeling and experiments. Engineering efforts aim to produce design guidelines for seals that can resist the new higher pressure design criteria. NIOSH researchers are also developing guidance for monitoring of <b>sealed</b> <b>area</b> atmospheres and inertization of potentially explosive gas mixtures within <b>sealed</b> <b>areas.</b> This paper seeks to encourage scientific discussion among international peers since preventing explosions within <b>sealed</b> <b>areas</b> is of interest to underground coal operators and regulators...|$|R

40|$|The Seal Team {{is divided}} into four primary areas. These areas include turbine engine seal development, {{structural}} seal development, acoustic seal development, and adaptive seal development.

The ability of flat fold N 95 FFRs, at lower seal pressures, to obtain similar fit factors as cup-shaped N 95 FFR at higher seal pressures offers the possibility of enhanced facial comfort without a loss of protection. Stereophotogrammetry offers a relatively simple, non-invasive technology to evaluate various properties of N 95 FFR fit.

40|$|Two {{numerical}} {{approaches are}} used to model {{the interaction between the}} turbine main gas flow and the wheelspace cavity seal flow. The 3 -D, unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved with a CFD code based on a structured grid to study the interaction between the turbine main gas flow and the wheelspace cavity seal flow. A CFD code based on an unstructured grid is used to solve detailed flow feature in the cavity seal which has a complex geometry. The numerical results confirm various observations from earlier experimental studies under similar flow conditions. When the flow rate through the rim cavity seal is increased, the ingestion of the main turbine flow into the rim <b>seal</b> <b>area</b> decreases drastically.

The numerical investigation uses a structured grid method to study the overall {{interaction between the}} turbine stage components and the wheelspace seal flow, and an unstructured grid method to resolve the detailed flow features within the geometrically complex cavity seal. The numerical results agree with various observations from experimental studies under similar flow conditions.

40|$|AbstractIn {{underground}} coal mines, {{the energy}} difference from <b>sealed</b> fire <b>area</b> to general mine atmosphere and variations in atmospheric pressure cause leakage, which {{can affect the}} stable status of <b>sealed</b> fire <b>area</b> even lead to reburning.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} novel non-contact {{methods for}} detecting faults in heat seals of food packages. Two alternative imaging technologies are investigated; laser scatter imaging and polarised light stress images. After segmenting the <b>seal</b> <b>area</b> {{from the rest}} of the respective image, a classifier is trained to detect faults in different regions of the <b>seal</b> <b>area</b> using features extracted from the pixels in the respective region. A very large set of candidate features, based on statistical information relating to the colour and texture of each region, is first extracted. Then an adaptive boosting algorithm (AdaBoost) is used to automatically select the best features for discriminating faults from non-faults. With this approach, different features can be selected and optimised for the different imaging methods. In experiments we compare the performance of classifiers trained using features extracted from laser scatter images only, polarised light stress images only, and a combination of both image types. The results show that the polarised light and laser scatter classifiers achieved accuracies of 96 % and 90 %, respectively, while the combination of both sensors achieved an accuracy of 95 %. These figures suggest that both systems have potential for commercial development...|$|E
40|$|Flexible {{packaging}} is {{a growing}} successful market {{and the majority of}} flexible package applications are for the food industry. The demand for process optimization and reduced production costs, has led to an increase in flexible packaging. However, fast production lines can result in contamination in the <b>seal</b> <b>area.</b> For flexible food packaging, contamination is considered any food particle or substance trapped in the <b>seal</b> <b>area.</b> Current quality control processes can detect contamination in the <b>seal</b> <b>area,</b> but it is not determined if seal contamination affects seal quality. Oil-based and sodium based snack foods are two common categories that can be packaged on a horizontal form fill and seal (HFFS) flow-wrap machine. The study uses vegetable oil and a salt water solution to simulate the effect of liquid contamination along the T-point of flexible pouches made on an HFFS. The T-point refers to where the fin seal meets the end seal and requires the seal jaw to seal through four layers of film, which is the most difficult point to seal. The study tests a combination of different sealing temperatures and dwell time to determine the optimal sealing condition for a hermetic seal. A quality hermetic seal provides an enclosed seal with no leaks due to successful polymer chain entanglement between the two sealant layers. The different test categories of the study are non-contaminated (control), salt water solution for salt based foods, and vegetable oil for oil-based foods. Given the test parameters of the study, 140 ⁰C sealing temperature and 0. 3 seconds dwell time are considered to be the optimal sealing condition for all three test categories. For Phase 1 of the study, salt water had a lower Hermeticity pass rate compared to vegetable oil and non-contaminated seals. In addition, the effect of refrigerated storage temperature and ambient storage temperature did not show to be significant for any of the test categories. However, refrigerated conditions showed a higher Hermeticity pass rate, but it was not statistically different. The findings for seal strength indicated no test category had higher or lower seal strength over the 14 day test period. Overall, the study shows there is no effect of liquid contaminant on Hermeticity and seal strength for flexible film with LLDPE sealant layer...|$|E

40|$|Case StudyA 2500 HP {{integral}} gear compressor in an {{air separation}} plant experienced an impeller failure {{in the first stage}} of compression. The failure was extensive and took the dry air compressor off-line. Plant production was curtailed for several weeks. Initial investigation focused on the 1 st stage centrifugal compressor impeller and upstream dust filter. Most of the aluminum impeller was missing and portions of the air filter element had melted. With the sequence and cause unclear, a formal root cause analysis (RCA) was undertaken. The RCA process ultimately revealed that an unexpected thermite reaction occurred and consumed most of the aluminum impeller. During compressor shutdown, products of the intensely exothermic thermite reaction backflowed into the upstream dust filter causing the element to partially melt. The thermite reaction initiated in the impeller back disk <b>seal</b> <b>area</b> where metal oxides and fuel (debris) had collected. Viscous heating and temperatures greater than expected allowed the rotating labyrinth seal to creep. Contact with the babbitted stationary seal generated additional heat and further accelerated the creep process. Frictional heating in the impeller back disk seal initiated the reaction. Corrective actions to prevent reoccurrence included a creep resistant impeller back disk seal and a passive debris removal system to prevent debris particles from collecting in the impeller back disk <b>seal</b> <b>area.</b> This compressor and a twin have operating reliably since 2003.
