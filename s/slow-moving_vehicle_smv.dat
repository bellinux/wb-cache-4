This paper elaborates on a small-scale solution for these problems: the passing bay. It investigates the impacts of a passing bay on the total delay for other motorized vehicles, the number of passing manoeuvres and hindered vehicles, and the mean delay per hindered vehicle. The latter is also {{considered to be an}} indicator for traffic safety. The calculations are performed for two characteristic trips with a <b>slow-moving</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The passing bay is an effective solution to reducing delays on arterial highways when two-way hourly volumes exceed 600 ¿ 1000 vehicles. The effects depend on the trip length and speed of the <b>slow-moving</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and on the passing sight distance limitations of the road. A distance of 2 ¿ 4 ?km between the passing bays seems an acceptable compromise between the reduction of delay for other motorized vehicles and the extra discomfort and delay for drivers of <b>slow-moving</b> <b>vehicles.</b> This result also shows that passing bays are not effective in regions where <b>slow-moving</b> <b>vehicles</b> mainly make trips shorter than this distanc...|$|R

40|$|<b>Slow-moving</b> <b>vehicles</b> are {{commonly}} {{found on the}} rural roads of Iowa. Common <b>slow-moving</b> <b>vehicles</b> in Iowa were analyzed {{as a part of}} this thesis which includes farm, construction, maintenance, and all-terrain vehicles as well as mopeds. Though <b>slow-moving</b> <b>vehicle</b> crashes represent {{a very small percentage of}} crashes in Iowa, the high speed differential of these vehicles and other traffic can result in higher severity crashes. It is important to determine the crash characteristics that tend to result in higher severity crashes and develop safety standards to help reduce those high severity crashes. This thesis analyzes the commonalities of laws across the nation pertaining to <b>slow-moving</b> <b>vehicle</b> safety. It also contains a 3 -year analysis of crashes in Iowa involving <b>slow-moving</b> <b>vehicles</b> and a statistical modeling of farm vehicle crash severity to determine crash characteristics that make a crash more likely to result in a high or low crash severity. The SMV Emblem is the most common safety requirement from state to state, though many differences are observed across the nation amongst other safety features. The circumstances found to increase crash severity in the rural farm vehicle crash model were when the farm vehicle was over 29 years old, when dark conditions existed during the crash, and when the crash occurred during the months of June, July, and August. The animal pulling the buggy was a common cause of collision of the crashes involving horse-drawn buggies. The moped/all-terrain vehicle group had the highest fatality rate of all four groups analyzed. About 70 % of the rural multiple vehicle crashes involving moped/all-terrain vehicles resulted from an incorrect action by the moped/all-terrain vehicles. Also, 60 % of the crashes involved moped/all-terrain vehicles were driven by a driver under the age of 24. Construction and maintenance vehicles were found to be responsible for fewer than 35 % of the rural crashes in which they were involved. From these analyses, recommendations were made with the purpose of reducing the severity of crashes involving <b>slow-moving</b> <b>vehicles</b> in Iowa...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: When {{we measure}} travel speeds of road sections, {{wider range of}} travel speed would be obtained. Driving in slow-speed {{sometime}} increases the stress of other drivers who intend to travel in higher speed. This might lead to hazardous behavior {{on the part of}} impatient drivers, such as reckless passing. This study aims to clarify in what situation drivers develop stress and what psychological and behavioral characteristics are manifested under these conditions. A basic survey was conducted to gain an understanding of the driving behavior of drivers under stress and their focus of attention as well as changes in their stressed condition. A full-scale survey was then made to gain insight into the extent of effect the provision of information has on driver stress. From the result of these surveys, it is found that the reduction in the stress differs according to the kind of information supplied from <b>slow-moving</b> <b>vehicles</b> ahead...|$|R

40|$|The multi-criteria {{trajectory}} {{planning for}} Space Manoeuvre <b>Vehicle</b> (<b>SMV)</b> is recognised as a challenging problem. Because of the nonlinearity and {{uncertainty in the}} dynamic model and even the objectives, {{it is hard for}} decision makers to balance all of the preference indices without violating strict path and box constraints. In this paper, to provide the designer an effective method and solve the trajectory hopping problem, an Interactive Fuzzy Physical Programming (IFPP) algorithm is introduced. A new multi-objective SMV optimal control problem is formulated and parameterized using an adaptive technique. By using the density function, the oscillations of the trajectory can be captured effectively. In addition, an interactive decision-making strategy is applied to modify the current designer’s preferences during optimization process. Two realistic decision-making scenarios are conducted by using the proposed algorithm; Simulation results indicated that without driving objective functions out of the tolerable region, the proposed approach can have better performance in terms of the satisfactory degree compared with other approaches like traditional weighted-sum method, Goal Programming (GP) and fuzzy goal programming (FGP). Also, the results can satisfy the current preferences given by the decision makers. Therefore, The method is potentially feasible for solving multi-criteria SMV trajectory planning problems...|$|R
