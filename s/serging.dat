40|$|The present article, as {{the title}} shows, is {{a study of the}} {{grammatical}} gender in Spanish from the semantic startpoint, as have are of opinion that linguistic reference is bound up with grammatical motivation. It deals with the gender of nouns will bear the sign [+ animate], and in particular those presenting a high sememic level (common semantic level) and another oppositional sememic (distintive semantic level). We state that [± animate] is a semantic feature capable of <b>serging</b> to motivate grammatical gender. To give an example, it seems demonstrable that nouns in Spanish which are sensible to the features [+anim, -spec] and [+anim, ±spec] (for example: niño 1 / niñO 2 / niñA) have got a fixed gender in the first case (niño 1) and a variable gender in the second (niñ 02 / niñA), the second —but not the first— beening determined by reference to sex. We have also demonstrated the following points: a) Among the items which show an opposition of gender, the superordinate (niño 1) will always be non-arked; b) the frequency with which this appears is approximately double the specific term. This distinction explains heteronyms of the type macho / hembra, hombre / mujer, etc., as generative lexic-semantic opposites of grammatical gender of the type hombre 1 / hombre 2 / mujer. We also affirm with regard to Spanish linguistic and metalinguistic capacity, and, 2) Spanish shows a strong tendency to differenciate between the sexes by means of sometimes unusual lexical creations, such as culebrO or mushúA (a women of foreign origin in Venezuela) and at other times by quite acceptable creations, as we find in the political, technical or juridical terrains. When Spanish lacks a lexical of morphological form to distinguish gender, it does so by means of the article or the demonstrative. In the present article we have referred particularly to the semantic distinction «sex». Nevertheless, our theory is valid for other dimensions as well, {{as long as they are}} capable of being specified as [± generic]. Finally, we state that gender is manifested in concordance and is frequently redundant...|$|E

50|$|As Yvan nurses {{his ear and}} bemoans his friends' aggression, Marc {{points out}} that <b>Serge's</b> recent opinion of Paula, much like his opinion of Marc, is much more rooted in <b>Serge's</b> loathing of intolerance. When <b>Serge</b> asks why Marc resents his friend's {{personal}} preferences, Marc concludes that while <b>Serge</b> once valued his input and guidance, he eventually {{went out of his}} way to gradually replace him in influence and company, with the Antrios symbolizing minimalist popularity. Marc wistfully wishes that <b>Serge</b> would have become a mutually empowering friend after all this time, while <b>Serge</b> is bitter over musing that Marc essentially owned his character for the entirety of their friendship.|$|R

50|$|Several {{nights later}} back at <b>Serge's</b> apartment, Marc and <b>Serge</b> anxiously await Yvan's arrival. <b>Serge</b> re-attempts to warm Marc to the {{painting}} by justifying the prestige around it, but then dismally mentions his divorce from his wife and only recently approved visitations to his children. As Marc tries again to jest at <b>Serge's</b> extravagance, he also genuinely apologizes for appearing inconsiderate. <b>Serge</b> accepts, and the two momentary reach a level of mutual humility, but he relents when confessing he finds Marc to be humorless recently, stating that Yvan agreed with him. As Marc absorbs the implications, <b>Serge</b> becomes antsy at Marc's stoic concern, and the two internally express disgust towards the other over their attitudes: <b>Serge</b> {{at the notion of}} Marc dictating his tastes, and Marc at <b>Serge's</b> recent dismissal of his criticism. At this point, Yvan barges in and launches into a comically distraught frenzy over his mother and fiancee's demands towards family names on the wedding invitation.|$|R
5000|$|Protests against <b>Serge's</b> {{imprisonment}} {{took place}} at several international conferences, most notably the International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture in 1935 in Paris. Protests came from intellectuals of various political ideologies, including Georges Duhamel, Charles Vildrac, Boris Souvarine, André Gide and Romain Rolland. <b>Serge</b> was able to correspond with Gide, and had a strong influence on him, later telling Gide to [...] "keep his eyes wide open" [...] while visiting the Soviet Union in 1936. Rolland corresponded with Genrikh Yagoda about <b>Serge's</b> manuscripts, eventually visited the Soviet Union and had meetings with Stalin during which <b>Serge</b> was mentioned. The <b>Serge</b> case caused the Soviet government considerable embarrassment and in 1936 Joseph Stalin {{announced that he was}} considering releasing <b>Serge</b> from prison. Pierre Laval, the French prime minister, refused to grant <b>Serge</b> an entry permit, but Emile Vandervelde, a veteran socialist who by then {{was a member of the}} Belgian government, managed to obtain <b>Serge</b> a visa to live in Belgium.|$|R
