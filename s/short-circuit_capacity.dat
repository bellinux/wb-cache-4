50|$|Several {{methods of}} {{starting}} a polyphase motor are used. Where a large inrush current and high starting torque can be permitted, the motor can be started across the line, by applying full line voltage to the terminals (direct-on-line, DOL). Where {{it is necessary to}} limit the starting inrush current (where the motor is large compared with the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>capacity</b> of the supply), the motor is started at reduced voltage using either series inductors, an autotransformer, thyristors, or other devices. A technique sometimes used is star-delta (YΔ) starting, where the motor coils are initially connected in star configuration for acceleration of the load, then switched to delta configuration when the load is up to speed. This technique is more common in Europe than in North America. Transistorized drives can directly vary the applied voltage as required by the starting characteristics of the motor and load.|$|E

In this paper, a methodology (modified BPSO) is presented for network reconfiguration {{which is based on}} the hybrid approach of Tabu search and BPSO algorithms to prevent the local convergence and to decrease the calculation time using double fitness to consider the constraints. Moreover, an average load simulated method (ALS method) considering load variation is proposed such that the average load value is used instead of the actual load for calculation. Finally, from a case study, the results of simulation certify that the approaches will decrease drastically the losses and improve the voltage profiles obviously; at the same time, the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>capacity</b> is also decreased into smaller shut-off capacity of the circuit breaker.

40|$|The {{equivalent}} {{test circuit}} that can deliver both short-circuit current and recovery voltage {{is used to}} verify the performance of high-voltage circuit breakers. Most of the parameters in this circuit {{can be obtained by}} using a simple calculation or a simulation program. The ratings of the circuit breaker include rated short-circuit breaking current, rated short-circuit making current, rated operating sequence of the circuit breaker and rated short-time current. Among these ratings, the <b>short-circuit</b> making <b>capacity</b> of the circuit breaker is expressed in peak value and not in RMS value similar to breaking capacity. A series resistor or super-excitation is used to control the peak value of the short-circuit current in the equivalent test circuit. When using a series resistor, a higher rating of circuit breakers leads to a higher thermal capacity, thereby requiring additional space. Therefore, an effective, optimal design of the series resistor is essential.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a rapid rise in the {{political}} saliency of the ever growing volumes of municipal waste produced in the UK. In this paper, we examine how one particular part of the municipal waste stream – biodegradable waste – has come under the policy spotlight. As targets to divert biodegradable waste from landfill under the Landfill Directive come into force, the need to focus explicitly on recovering value from biodegradable materials has risen up national and local policy agendas, not least {{with the introduction of}} the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme. Accompanying this new rationality for managing waste has been a suite of different policy interventions. In this paper we examine the impact of the changing nature of municipal waste policy {{and the ways in which}} it has sought to rework the disposal and collection of biodegradable waste. We argue that the predominantly technical framing and instrumental rationality of these interventions does not sufficiently challenge entrenched understandings regarding the boundaries between public and private responsibility for waste, and thus <b>short-circuits</b> their <b>capacity</b> to engage with everyday community/individual waste practices.

40|$|The Thesis {{presents}} an in-depth study of arcing behaviour of H. B. C. Fuses {{for a range}} of fuse elements and fillers, under critical current conditions. The methodologies used were the standard breaking <b>capacity</b> <b>short-circuit</b> test plus the application of crow-bar, Xray studies, metallographic microscopic and optical fiber arc detection techniques. Due to the observation of some unknown and puzzling arc phenomena it was decided to pursue the arc investigation by an extensive test programme of single uniform wire fuse elements. From the investigation a basic arc mechanism for the pre-peak and post-peak arcs period was discovered. The new mechanism was applied to single wire, strip, long notched, medium notched and short notched fuse elements and to paralleled wires and strips immersed in three quartz filler types: standard sand, high quality granular quartz and bound quartz in two different sizes. The proposed arc mechanism was modelled by a computer program which was used to simulate the described fuse constructions. The results of over 800 tests and subsequent simulation undoubtedly confirm that the proposed arc mechanism is applicable for the described fuse types. The experimental and analytical results are close enough to justify the model application for fuse designers and fuse users. A critical comparison of the experimental and analytical results with previous findings published by other researchers is presented. A detailed arc mechanism and the key behaviour rules are proposed, they are: " Maximum column voltage can not exceed the arc-root voltage. " The arc-root voltage and the initial dv/dt values are influenced by filler characteristics and are able to precisely characterize the filler behaviour. " The dv/dt, and consequently the burn-back are instantaneous current density functions. The application of the above rules allows the fuse designer to tailor the fuse element in order to obtain specific current and arc voltage waveforms. It is believed that the proposed arc mechanism and computer model is able to explain some puzzling are phenomena and eventually could be applied to predicting other low overload H. B.

30|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{consistency}} evaluation of the current distributions obtained from short-circuit tests. It is clear that the consistency of current distribution can be evaluated by to what extent Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) is met in the AT feeding system. Therefore, the current deviations at each node are to be calculated. As the current deviations vary with the fault site and system <b>short-circuit</b> <b>capacity,</b> they are normalized by the short-circuit current. The maximum and mean of the normalized current deviations are selected as the evaluation indices. The short-circuit current is estimated with the generalized method of symmetrical components (GMSC). It is found that the short-circuit current varies greatly with the utilized equation, and its standard deviation may also be selected as an index. To obtain a unified index, the three indices are summed. The unified index is then used in two case studies, and the results show that it can clearly distinguish the consistency of the short-circuit test.|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to measure a number of key input parameters quantifying geochemical processes in the subsurface environment of the Savannah River Site's (SRS's) Saltstone Facility. For the first time, sorption (K{sub d}) values of numerous radionuclides were measured with Saltstone and Vault 2 concrete. Particular attention was directed at understanding how Tc adsorbs and desorbs from these cementitious materials with the intent to demonstrate that desorption occurs at a much slower rate than adsorption, thus permitting the use of kinetic terms instead of (or along with) the steady state K{sub d} term. Another very important parameter measured was the reduction capacity of these materials. This parameter is used to estimate the duration that the Saltstone facility remains in a reduced chemical state, a condition that maintains several otherwise mobile radionuclides in an immobile form. Key findings of this study follow. K{sub d} values for Am, Cd, Ce, Co, Cs, Hg, I, Np, Pa, Pu, Se, Sn, Tc, U, and Y for Saltstone and Vault 2 concrete were measured under oxidized and reduced conditions. Precipitation of several of the higher valence state radionuclides was observed. There was little evidence that the Vault 2 and Saltstone K{sub d} values differed from previous SRS K{sub d} values measured with reducing grout (Kaplan and Coates 2007). These values also supported a previous finding that K{sub d} values of slag-containing cementitious materials, tend to be greater for cations and about the same for anions, than regular cementitious materials without slag. Based on these new findings, it was suggested that all previous reducing concrete K{sub d} values be used in future PAs, except Np(V) and Pu(IV) K{sub d} values, which should be increased, and I values, which should be slightly decreased in all three stages of concrete aging. The reduction capacity of Saltstone, consisting of 23 wt-% blast furnace slag, was 821. 8 microequivalents per gram ({micro}eq/g). This value was approximately the same value as the one measured for 100 % blast furnace slag. The cause for this approximately four-fold greater reduction capacity than anticipated is not known, but may be the result of the higher pH of Saltstone (pH {approx} 11) compared to blast furnace slag (pH {approx} 8), the presence of reducing minerals in the fly ash used to make the Saltstone, or to the Saltstone possibly having semi-conductor properties. These reduction capacity values will result in a near four-fold increase in the estimated duration that the Saltstone facility will remain in a reduced chemical state. The implication of this result is that oxidation-state-sensitive contaminants, such as Pu, Np, and Tc, will remain for a longer duration in a much less mobile form than previously believed. The reduction capacity of vault concrete, which consisted of 10 wt-% blast furnace slag, was 240 {micro}eq/g. Essentially all Am, Cd, Ce, Co, Cs, Hg, Sr, and Y was (ad) sorbed within four hours, whereas 10 {sup 3 } fold slower than (ad) sorption (under reducing conditions). An important implication of this finding is that if groundwater by-passes or <b>short-circuits</b> the reduction <b>capacity</b> of the Saltstone by flowing along a crack, the ability of the oxygenated water to promote Tc desorption is appreciably less than that predicted based on the K{sub d} value. Relatively low Tc K{sub d} values, 6 to 91 mL/g, were measured in these studies indicating that little if any of the Tc(VII) introduced into the Saltstone or Vault 2 concrete suspensions was reduced to Tc(IV). Such a reduction results in apparent K{sub d} values on the order of 10 {sup 4 } mL/g. As such, these Tc sorption/desorption experiments need additional investigation to fully represent Saltstone environmental conditions. It is important to understand the limits of these data. They do not provide insight into how radionuclides cured and immobilized in Saltstone will leach from the Saltstone. However they do provide insight into how radionuclides once released into porewater will interact with Saltstone or vault concrete. The use of these site-specific data would greatly improve the pedigree of the input data for the Saltstone performance assessment. Additionally, these studies provided important guidance and technical justification for the conceptual geochemical model to be used in the Saltstone performance assessment...|$|R

40|$|A {{distribution}} system {{was designed and}} operated by considering unidirectional power flow from a utility source to end-use loads. The large penetrations of distributed generation (DG) into the existing {{distribution system}} causes a variety of technical problems, such as frequent tap changing problems of the on-load tap changer (OLTC) transformer, local voltage rise, protection coordination, exceeding <b>short-circuit</b> <b>capacity,</b> and harmonic distortion. In view of voltage regulation, the intermittent fluctuation of the DG output power results in frequent tap changing operations of the OLTC transformer. Thus, many utilities limit the penetration level of DG and are eager to find the reasonable penetration limits of DG in the distribution system. To overcome this technical problem, utilities have developed a new voltage regulation method in the distribution system with a large DG penetration level. In this paper, the impact of DG on the OLTC operations controlled by the line drop compensation (LDC) method is analyzed. In addition, a generalized determination methodology for the DG penetration limits in a distribution substation transformer is proposed. The proposed DG penetration limits could be adopted for a simplified interconnection process in DG interconnection guidelines...|$|E

To achieve high DG penetration levels, the system must be capable of operating in “DG-only” mode, i.e., with the upper level energy out of supplied. For this purpose, the BESS inverter should provide frequency and voltage regulation, while additional technical requirements may also exist, including the provision of sufficient <b>short-circuit</b> <b>capacity</b> for proper operation of the network overcurrent protection. For this purpose, additional devices, such as synchronous condensers, may be foreseen, while flywheels may also be used for primary frequency response, to reduce pressure on the BESS system. While such technical issues are fundamental for a real-world system, in the analysis presented in this paper emphasis is placed on the energy transactions between system components on relatively long time scales (hours and beyond), and hence, all dynamic phenomena and associated components have been ignored.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a coordinated voltage control scheme (CVCS) for {{a cluster of}} offshore wind power plants connected to a voltage-source converter-based high-voltage direct current system. The primary control point of the proposed voltage control scheme is the introduced Pilot bus, which is having the highest <b>short-circuit</b> <b>capacity</b> in the offshore AC grid. The developed CVCS comprehends an optimization algorithm, aiming for minimum active power losses in the offshore grid, to generate voltage reference to the Pilot bus. During the steady-state operation, the Pilot bus voltage is controlled by dispatching reactive power references to each wind turbine (WT) in the wind power plant cluster based on their available reactive power margin and network sensitivity-based participation factors, which are derived from the dV/dQ sensitivity of a WT bus w. r. t. the Pilot bus. This method leads to the minimization {{of the risk of}} undesired effects, particularly overvoltage at the terminals of the WT located far away from the AC collector substation, by dispatching lower reactive power references compared with the ones nearer to the substation.

40|$|Vector {{current control}} based on Phase-locked loop, {{regardless}} of its popularity in control of grid-connected converters, performs under the limitation of the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>capacity</b> of the connected ac system. A previously proposed method, power-synchronization control (PSC), by L. Zhang et al. has been demonstrated good performance in HVDC links especially in case of weak ac grid interconnection. This method utilizes the internal synchronization mechanism, analogous to the operation of a synchronous machine in ac grids. By using this technique, the voltage source converter (VSC) avoids the instability caused by a standard PLL in a weak ac-system connection. Moreover, a VSC terminal can give the weak ac system strong voltage support, just like a common synchronous machine does. In this paper, generalized voltage droop (GVD) strategy is developed based on PSC to provide more flexibility in control paradigm of MTDC grids and smoother transition among different operation modes of converter stations. GVD is implemented at the primary layer of a two-layer hierarchical control structure of MTDC grid, and brings about some new features such as fixed power control and fixed dc voltage control, additional to the conventional voltage droop characteristics. The mode transition can be achieved according to the set point given by the secondary layer of the control framework. Analytical justifications are given to demonstrate the effectiveness in each control mode and the capability in soft mode transition. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|E
40|$|For {{high-voltage}} direct-current (HVDC) transmission, {{the strength}} of the ac system is important for normal operation. An ac system can be considered as weak either because its impedance is high or its inertia is low. A typical high-impedance systemis when an HVDC link is terminated at a weak point of a large ac system where the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>capacity</b> of the ac system is low. Low-inertia systems are considered to have limited number of rotating machines, or no machines at all. Examples of such applications can be found when an HVDC link is powering an isand system, or if it is connected to a wind farm. One of the advantages of applying a voltage-source converter (VSC) based HVDC systemis its potential to be connected to very weak ac systems where the conventional linecommutated converter (LCC) based HVDC system has difficulties. In this thesis, the modeling and control issues for VSC-HVDC links connected to weak ac systems are investigated. In order to fully utilize the potential of the VSC-HVDC system for weak-ac-system connections, a novel control method, i. e., powersynchronization control, is proposed. By using power-synchronization control, the VSC resembles the dynamic behavior of a synchronous machine. Several additional functions, such as high-pass current control, current limitation, etc. are proposed to deal with  issues during operation. For modeling of ac/dc systems, the Jacobian transfer matrix is proposed as a unified modeling approach. With the ac Jacobian transfer matrix concept, a synchronous ac system is viewed upon as one multivariable feedback system. In the thesis, it is shown that the transmission zeros and poles of the Jacobian transfer matrix are closely related to several power-system stability phenomena. The similar modeling concept is extended to model a dc system with multiple VSCs. It is mathematically proven that the dc system is an inherently unstable process, which requires feedback controllers to be stabilized. For VSC-HVDC links using power-synchronization control, the short-circuit ratio (SCR) of the ac system is no longer a limiting factor, but rather the load angles. The righthalf plane (RHP) transmission zero of the ac Jacobian transfer matrix moves closer to the origin with larger load angles, which imposes a fundamental limitation on the achievable bandwidth of the VSC. As an example, it is shown that a VSC-HVDC link using powersynchronization control enables a power transmission of 0. 86 p. u. from a system with an SCR of 1. 2 to a system with an SCR of 1. 0. For low-inertia systemconnections, simulation studies show that power-synchronization control is flexible for various operation modes related to island operation and handles the mode shifts seamlessly.

40|$|This master thesis {{has looked}} upon the fault ride through {{capability}} assessment for small-scale hydro {{power plants in}} the distribution grid. In this report, {{the shape of the}} voltage dip has been studied, and the voltage angle impact on critical clearing time has been analyzed. A model of the Snåsa grid has been used to study faults with the simulation program SIMPOW. The SINTEF DipLab has been simulated, and the results from simulations have been compared to measurements made during experiments at Bruvollelva power plant. An in-house lab has been built to study the significance of the surrounding grid, as a weaker grid connection theoretically increases the voltage angle fluctuations, and hence decreases the critical clearing time of the generator. When studying the voltage dips caused by three phase symmetrical faults in the distribution grid, the location of the fault has proven to be important. One of the reasons is the difference in voltage angle. The voltage dips with origin in a fault in a parallel radial to the point of measurement gives a small fluctuation in voltage angle, while faults between the point of measurement and the swing bus creates larger changes in voltage angle. The reason is that the whole load flow changes when the swing bus is disconnected, and the DG units have to cover all the demand. The critical clearing time for the distributed generating unit Bruvollelva was simulated in this report for two different cases. A symmetrical fault was implemented, and the same voltage profile was then implemented without the same voltage angle response. The increase in critical clearing time was about 20 % for the voltage dips with origin between the DG unit and the swing bus, while the increase was much lower for the faults with origin in a parallel radial. A correlation can be seen, as the faults leading to the highest fluctuations in voltage angle was the same faults that gave the largest increases in clearing time. This indicates that the voltage angle has a considerable impact on the critical clearing times of the machine, and hence a considerable impact on the fault ride through capability assessment. The implementation guidelines for network codes amplifies the importance of the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>capacity</b> at the connection point in the pre-fault and post-fault condition. The robustness of the network has significant impact of the FRT performance, and a minimum requirement for short circuit capacity should be defined in the national FRT restrictions. An in-house lab was built to verify the results from the simulations. The outcome was surprising, as a weak grid connection lead to a clearing time of 600 ms when the generator was operating at 7 Nm, while the stronger grid connection made the generator trip at 500 ms. The experiments should however have been made with a longer cable, and should be repeated to increase the credibility of the results. Another verification of the simulation model was made when the measurements from the experiments made at Bruvollelva was compared to simulations. The results showed that the voltage dips were similar. Protection relays should also have been implemented to the simulations model, as they were a limiting factor {{when it came to the}} clearing time of the fault. Generally, the measured dips caused by the DipLab were more square shaped than the simulated dips. It has been showed that the voltage due to a three phase fault is less square shaped at the generator nodes than in the rest of the system due to a higher inductance in the short circuit impedance. This is especially the case for periods with high production...|$|E
