During the past decade, the {{market share of}} imported scallops has increased drastically. The scallop fishery in the U. S. is now facing potential competitions from imports. Continuing efforts to provide information {{on the effect of}} increasing imports on the U. S. scallop market is warranted. In addition, the impacts of supply increases on domestic scallop prices, either through wild stock enhancement programs or aquaculture operations, merit further investigation. An Annington model is developed in this study to assess the demand for scallops in the United States. Time series data for 1980 - 1998 are used in the estimation of the model. Results indicate that the demand for U. S. domestic scallops is less elastic in the short run than in the long run.

Poseban je naglasak stavljen na prikaz mogućnosti kontroliranog uzgoja školjkaša u bočatim vodama ušća. U ušću rijeke Krke utvrđeno je 56 svojti iz 27 porodica. Najrasprostranjenije su ove svojte: dagnja (Mytilus galloprovincialis), kamenica (Ostrea edulis), a česte su: jestiva srčanka (Cerastoderma glaucum), prnjavica (Venus verrucosa), kućica (Tapes decussatus), kunjka (Arca noae), mala kapica (Chlamys varia) i jakovska kapica (Pecten jacobaeus). Izlov prirodnih populacija školjkaša za prehranu tradicionalna je djelatnost i procjenjuje se na 100 tona u godini. Istraživanja mogućnosti kontroliranog uzgoja dagnje, kamenice, male kapice i jakovske kapice rezultirala su razvojem tehnologija konroliranog uzgoja dagnje i kamenice 1983., a jakovske kapice i male kapice godine 1989. Danas je proizvodnja organizirana na 25 lokaliteta, ukupne površine 87. 142 m 2, s mogućnošću proizvodnje oko 1. 500 tona dagnji i deset tisuća kamenica, a mogla bi se povećati iznad 10. 000 tona. Krka River {{spring is}} {{at the foot of}} Dinara mountain, {{starting}} from a 22 m high Topoljski waterfall. Its length is 72. 5 km, and total slope 242 m. The length of freshwater waterway is 49 km and brackish waterway, i. e. flooded river mouth, 23. 5 km long. Impact of seawater and depth of surface fresh water greatly vary depending on the river waterlevel, local precipitation, tides and wind directions. Owing to the extensive primary production in the river mouth shellfish are abundantly present with 56 species. The most abundant are Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprouincialis) and flat oyster (Ostrea edulis), and partly common cockle (Cerastoderma glaucum), Venus shell (Venus verucosa), calico clam (Tapes decussates), Noah 2 ̆ 7 s arc (Arca noae), variegated scallop (Chlamis uaria) and Pilgrim 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>scallop</b> (Pecten jacobaeus). Owing to very productive processes in the ecosystem of river mouth, fishing in the area is traditionally practice. The knowledge about natural populations of Mediterranean mussel fished out in quantities larger than 100 t/y have initiated the research on since 1979 shellfish in this area. Investigations on possibilities of commercial farming of Mediterranean mussel, flat oyster, variegated scallop and Pilgrim 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>scallop</b> (Pecten jacobaeus) resulted in defining the technological procedure for commercial farming of Mediterranean mussel and flat oyster (1983), and variegated scallop and Pilgrim 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>scallop</b> (1989).

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this Master s thesis was to study if organic waste particles released from cage fish farms could be assimilated by the great scallop (P. maximus) through a laboratory trial and a field trial. In the laboratory experiment, scallops were co-fed salmon feed or salmon feces with algae at two different concentrations for 25 days. In the field study, scallops were installed in the sea for 3 months at four experimental stations close to a fish farm at the coast of western Norway (Florø). The laboratory trial showed that phytoplankton {{was the most important}} part of the <b>scallop</b> <b>s</b> diet, resulting in better growth and condition. Scallops co-fed salmon feed or feces showed higher concentrations of 18 : 1 (n- 9) in the digestive gland tissues compared to scallops fed algae alone. This suggested that scallops have utilized salmon feed and feces, due to the high amounts of 18 : 1 (n- 9) in the supplemented feed. The scallops in the laboratory trial were found to incorporate phytoplankton over salmon feed and feces as long as algae were present in high amount. Less selectivity was observed when phytoplankton concentration was low. The field study showed that the fatty acid signature in scallop digestive gland tissues, and to some degree gonad tissues, had high fractions of specific fatty acids found in high concentrations in diatoms (16 : 0, 16 : 1 n- 7, EPA) and dinoflagellates (16 : 0, 18 : 4 n- 3, EPA, DHA). This suggested that phytoplankton was an important part of the <b>scallop</b> <b>s</b> diet. <b>Scallops</b> cultivated under the influence of waste particles from the fish farm incorporated a higher fraction of 18 : 1 (n- 9) compared to the Reference stations. The incorporation of 18 : 1 (n- 9) showed that scallops were able to exploit the fish farm waste at least 200 meters away from the fish farm at 5 meters depth. The scallops utilized the extra energy from the farm effluents for growth, resulting in a higher growth rate at the Farm station compared to the Reference station.

We show that Drosophila Mask forms a complex with Yki and its binding partner, <b>Scalloped</b> (<b>Sd),</b> on target-gene promoters and is essential for Yki to drive transcription of target genes and tissue growth. Furthermore, the stability and subcellular localization of both Mask and Yki is coregulated in response to various stimuli.

40|$|SummaryThe Hippo (Hpo) kinase cascade restricts {{tissue growth}} by inactivating the {{transcriptional}} coactivator Yorkie (Yki), which regulates {{the expression of}} target genes such as the cell death inhibitor diap 1 by unknown mechanisms.

The diap 1 (th) locus harbors a minimal Sd-binding Hpo Responsive Element (HRE) that mediates transcriptional regulation by the Hpo pathway. Sd binds directly to Yki, and a Yki missense mutation that abrogates Sd-Yki binding also inactivates Yki function in vivo. We further demonstrate that sd is required for yki-induced tissue overgrowth and target gene expression, and that sd activity is conserved in its mammalian homolog.

30|$|The context {{specificity}} of Ey-dependent growth {{suggests that there}} are different signaling pathways in the different disc regions that modulate the effect of Ey overexpression on tissue growth. <b>Scalloped</b> (<b>Sd),</b> a component of the Hippo signaling pathway, is highly expressed in the pouch of the wing disc and very weakly expressed in the notum region (Campbell et al., 1992). To determine whether Sd may contribute to the context-dependent growth of Ey in wing disc, we examined the effect of expressing Sd with Ey. Coexpression of Sd with Ey significantly inhibited the ability of Ey to promote cell growth in the notum region (Fig.  1 E). In addition, coexpression of Sd with Ey can also inhibit cell growth in the pouch and hinge regions as shown by decreased clone size (Fig.  1 E). Therefore Sd can antagonize the ability of Ey to promote cell growth and the high level of Sd in the wing pouch region potentially contributes to the inability of Ey to promote growth in the pouch.|$|R

50|$|Activated Wts {{can then}} go on to phosphorylate and {{inactivate}} the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki). Yki is unable to bind DNA by itself. In its active state, Yki binds to the transcription factor <b>Scalloped</b> (<b>Sd),</b> and the Yki-Sd complex becomes localized to the nucleus. This allows for the expression of several genes that promote organ growth, such as cyclin E, which promotes cell cycle progression, and diap1 (Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1), which, as its name suggests, prevents apoptosis. Yki also activates expression of the bantam microRNA, a positive growth regulator that specifically affects cell number. Thus, the inactivation of Yki by Wts inhibits growth through the transcriptional repression of these pro-growth regulators. By phosphorylating Yki at serine 168, Wts promotes the association of Yki with 14-3-3 proteins, which help to anchor Yki in the cytoplasm and prevent its transport to the nucleus. In mammals, the two Yki orthologs are Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). When activated, YAP and TAZ can bind to several transcription factors including p73, Runx2 and several TEADs.

In Drosophila, Hpo signaling regulates gene expression by inhibiting a transcription complex {{consisting of the}} transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki) and the TEAD/TEF family of transcription factor <b>Scalloped</b> (<b>Sd).</b> Here we provide genetic evidence that both isoforms of 14 - 3 - 3, 14 - 3 - 3 ɛ and 14 - 3 - 3 ζ, regulate Yki activity through modulating its subcellular localization. Inactivation of 14 - 3 - 3 by RNAi or genetic mutations enhanced whereas overexpression of 14 - 3 - 3 suppressed tissue overgrowth induced by Yki overexpression. Loss of 14 - 3 - 3 resulted in the accumulation of Yki in the nucleus. We found that regulation of Yki by 14 - 3 - 3 was mediated by phosphorylation of Yki at S 168. In addition, we found that Hpo signaling also inhibited Yki nuclear localization and activity by phosphorylating Yki at S 111 and S 250, and this inhibition appears to be independent of 14 - 3 - 3. Finally, we provided evidence that Hpo signaling restricted Yki nuclear localization depending on CRM 1 -mediated nuclear export...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe nanomechanical {{properties}} of the coiled-coils of myosin are fundamentally important in understanding muscle assembly and contraction. Force spectra of single molecules of double-headed myosin, single-headed myosin, and coiled-coil tail fragments were acquired with an atomic force microscope and displayed characteristic triphasic force-distance responses to stretch: a rise phase (R) and a plateau phase (P) and an exponential phase (E). The R and P phases arise mainly from the stretching of the coiled-coils, with the hinge region being the main contributor to the rise phase at low force. Only the E phase was analyzable by the worm-like chain model of polymer elasticity. Restrained molecular mechanics simulations on an existing x-ray structure of <b>scallop</b> <b>S</b> 2 yielded force spectra with either two or three phases, depending on the mode of stretch. It revealed that coiled-coil chains separate completely {{near the end of}} the P phase and the stretching of the unfolded chains gives rise to the E phase. Extensive conformational searching yielded a P phase force near 40 pN that agreed well with the experimental value. We suggest that the flexible and elastic S 2 region, particularly the hinge region, may undergo force-induced unfolding and extend reversibly during actomyosin powerstroke...|$|R
40|$|Cell proliferation, {{growth and}} {{survival}} are three different basic processes which converge at determining a fundamental property –the size of an organism. <b>Scalloped</b> (<b>Sd)</b> is the first characterised transcriptional partner to Yorkie (Yki), the downstream effector of the Hippo pathway which is a highly potential and evolutionarily conserved regulator of organ size. Here we have studied the hypomorphic effect of sd {{on the development of}} Mushroom Bodies (MBs) in Drosophila brain. We show that, sd non-function results in an increase in the size of MBs. We demonstrate that, sd regulation on MB size operates through multiple routes. Sd expressed in the differentiated MB neurons, imposes non-cell autonomous repression on the proliferation of MB precursor cells, and Sd expression in the MB neuroblasts (NB) cell autonomously represses mushroom body neuroblast (MBNB) proliferation. Further Sd in Kenyon cells (KCs) imparts a cell autonomous restriction on their growth. Our findings are distinctive because, while the classical sd loss of function phenotypes in eye, wing and lymph gland are reported as loss of tissue or reduced organ size, the present study shows that, Sd inactivation in the developing MB, promotes precursor cell proliferation and results in an increase in the organ size...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe Salvador-Warts-Hippo (SWH) pathway is an {{evolutionarily}} conserved regulator {{of tissue}} growth that is deregulated in human cancer [1 – 3]. Upstream SWH pathway components convey signals from neighboring cells via a core kinase cassette to the transcription coactivator Yorkie (Yki) [4]. Yki controls tissue growth by modulating activity of transcription factors including <b>Scalloped</b> (<b>Sd)</b> [1 – 3]. To date, five SWH pathway kinases have been identified, but large-scale phosphoproteome {{studies suggest that}} unidentified SWH pathway kinases exist [5, 6]. To identify such kinases, we performed an RNA interference screen and isolated homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (Hipk). Unlike previously identified SWH pathway kinases, Hipk is unique {{in its ability to}} promote, rather than repress, Yki activity and does so in parallel to the Yki-repressive kinase, Warts (Wts). Hipk is required for basal Yki activity and is likely to regulate Yki function by promoting its accumulation in the nucleus. Like many SWH pathway proteins, Hipk’s function is evolutionarily conserved as its closest human homolog, HIPK 2, promotes activity of the Yki ortholog YAP in a kinase-dependent fashion. Further, HIPK 2 promotes YAP abundance, suggesting that the mechanism by which HIPK 2 regulates YAP has diverged in mammals...|$|R

40|$|The Drosophila melanogaster <b>scalloped</b> (<b>sd)</b> gene is a homolog of {{the human}} TEF- 1 gene {{and is a member}} of the TEA/ATTS domain-containing family of {{transcription}} factors. In Drosophila, sd is involved in wing development as well as neural development. Herein, data are presented from a molecular analysis of five recessive lethal sd alleles. Only one of these alleles complements a viable allele associated with an sd mutant wing phenotype, suggesting that functions important for wing development are compromised by the noncomplementing alleles. Two of the wing noncomplementing alleles have mutations that help to define a VG-binding domain for the SD protein in vivo, and another noncomplementing allele has a lesion within the TEA DNA-binding domain. The VG-binding domain overlaps with a domain important for viability of the fly, since two of the sd lethal lesions are located there. The fifth lethal affects a yet undefined motif lying just outside the VG-binding domain in the C-terminal direction that affects both wing phenotype and viability. This is the first example linking mutations affecting specific amino acids in the SD protein with phenotypic consequences for the organism...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundCoordinated {{multicellular}} growth during {{development is}} achieved by the sensing of spatial and nutritional boundaries. The conserved Hippo (Hpo) signaling pathway has been proposed to restrict tissue growth by perceiving mechanical constraints through actin cytoskeleton networks. The actin-associated LIM proteins Zyxin (Zyx) and Ajuba (Jub) {{have been linked to}} the control of tissue growth via regulation of Hpo signaling, but the study of Zyx has been hampered by a lack of genetic tools. ResultsWe generated a zyx mutant in Drosophila using TALEN endonucleases and used this to show that Zyx antagonizes the FERM-domain protein Expanded (Ex) to control tissue growth, eye differentiation, and F-actin accumulation. Zyx membrane targeting promotes the interaction between the transcriptional co-activator Yorkie (Yki) and the transcription factor <b>Scalloped</b> (<b>Sd),</b> leading to activation of Yki target gene expression and promoting tissue growth. Finally, we show that Zyx’s growth-promoting function is dependent on its interaction with the actin-associated protein Enabled (Ena) via a conserved LPPPP motif and is antagonized by Capping Protein (CP). ConclusionsOur results show that Zyx is a functional antagonist of Ex in growth control and establish a link between actin filament polymerization and Yki activity...|$|R
