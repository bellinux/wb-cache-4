5|$|Tessa Newsom worked {{three jobs}} to support Gavin {{and his sister}} Hilary Newsom Callan, who is the {{president}} of the PlumpJack Group, named after the opera Plump Jack composed by family friend Gordon Getty. In an interview with The San Francisco Chronicle, his sister recalled Christmas holidays when their mother told them there wouldn't be any gifts. Tessa opened their home to foster children, instilling in Newsom the importance of public service. His father's finances were <b>strapped</b> <b>in</b> part because of his tendency to give away his earnings. Newsom worked several jobs in high school to help support his family.|$|E
5|$|Residents of Cove Neck {{immediately}} called emergency services. Jeff Race, a paramedic {{and member of}} New York City's Emergency Medical Service who lived {{half a mile from}} the crash site was the first rescuer on site. He reported that most passengers were still <b>strapped</b> <b>in</b> their seats and the survivors were crying out for help. Survivors later commented that it took about half an hour for rescue teams to arrive. Initial reports to emergency services reported that a much larger Boeing 747 had crashed. Fire Chief Thomas Reardon of Oyster Bay Fire Company No. 1 {{was in charge of the}} initial effort to remove people from the wreckage. In his first call to the Nassau County Fire Commission dispatch, he requested all the help available. Thirty-seven fire and ambulance companies, as well as more than seven hundred Nassau County police officers arrived to help. Other companies that were not called showed up voluntarily to assist. The swell of support created major problems for extricating survivors.|$|E
25|$|Stomp pads, {{which are}} placed between the {{bindings}} {{closer to the}} rear binding, allow the rider to better control the board with only one boot <b>strapped</b> <b>in,</b> such as when maneuvering onto a chair lift, riding a ski tow or performing a one footed trick. Whereas the upper surface of the board is smooth, the stomp pad has a textured pattern which provides grip to {{the underside of the}} boot. Stomp pads can be decorative and vary in their size, shape and the kind and number of small spikes or friction points they provide.|$|E

25|$|The {{passengers}} were left hanging upside-down in their seats. One mother {{was holding a}} baby that was not <b>strapped</b> <b>in.</b> All on board escaped from the aircraft, with three people needing to be treated in hospital suffering from shock. A number of {{passengers were}} also treated at Lympne. Thirty-six of the passengers continued their journey to London, some with fuel-soaked clothing. The aircraft, with a replacement cost of £250,000, was written off. This was the first Avro 748/HS 748 to be written off in an accident. Skyways Coach-Air leased an Avro 748 from LIAT {{for two years in}} 1968 to replace the aircraft lost.|$|E
25|$|In late January 1942, the {{squadron}} became operational {{and joined the}} remnants of several others {{that had been in}} Malaya, operating out of RAF Seletar and RAF Kallang. During one of his first sorties, Gorton was involved in a brief dogfight over the South China Sea, after which he suffered engine failure and was forced to land on Bintan island, 40km (25mi) south east of Singapore. As he landed, one of the Hurricane's wheels hit an embankment and flipped over. Gorton was not properly <b>strapped</b> <b>in</b> and his face hit the gun sight and windscreen, mutilating his nose and breaking both cheekbones. He also suffered severe lacerations to both arms. He made {{his way out of the}} wreck and was rescued by members of the Royal Dutch East Indies Army, who provided some medical treatment. Gorton later claimed that his face was so badly cut and bruised, that a member of the RAF sent to collect him assumed he was near death, collected his personal effects and returned to Singapore without him. By chance, one week later, Sgt Matt O'Mara of No. 453 Squadron RAAF also crash landed on Bintan, and arranged for them to be collected.|$|E

500|$|Entirely amateur, {{the team}} mostly {{comprised}} players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the Air Force of Zimbabwe. Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer Duncan Fletcher. Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee {{who had played}} for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor. The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital Lusaka and then to Luanda in Angola, from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. [...] "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. [...] "There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, <b>strapped</b> <b>in</b> and set off into the unknown.

2500|$|Late on the {{afternoon}} of July 21, the divers finally recovered both the bodies of Kennedy and the Bessette sisters. Divers found the Bessette sisters were near the fuselage, while Kennedy himself was still <b>strapped</b> <b>in</b> his seat. Coast Guard Admiral Richard M. Larrabee said that all three bodies were [...] "near and under" [...] the fuselage, still <b>strapped</b> <b>in.</b> The bodies were taken to the county medical examiner's office by motorcade. Autopsies on the evening of July 21 performed by the county medical examiner's office found that all three had died upon impact. At the same time, the Kennedy and Bessette families announced their plans for memorial services. After the autopsies were completed, the three bodies were taken from Hyannis to Duxbury, where they were cremated in the Mayflower Cemetery crematorium.|$|E

2500|$|The {{machine was}} {{completed}} in July 1913, and made its maiden flight as a landplane on 14 July 1913. It was fitted with its floats and carried out flotation tests on the Basingstoke Canal at Mytchett on 30 July. The floats were then removed and replaced again by skids and wheels for more flight trials. Early {{on the morning of}} 7 August Cody carried out a 70-mile (113km) test flight, with the plan of flying down to Calshot, Southampton, where the aircraft would be fitted with its floats to carry out test flights from water. [...] He agreed, however, to give a flight to the [...] Hampshire cricketer William Evans and took off at 10:30 am with Evans as a passenger. After about eight minutes the aircraft broke up in the air at a height of about 200ft (60m) with Cody and Evans, who were not <b>strapped</b> <b>in,</b> being thrown out of the aircraft. Both were killed. The Royal Aero Club accident investigation concluded that the accident was due to [...] "inherent structural weakness", and suggested that Cody and Evans might have survived the crash if <b>strapped</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The main use of {{the curb}} chain is to enhance and control the lever action of a curb bit. Additionally, it helps to keep the bit steady and in place within the mouth. On English Pelham and Double bridles the curb chin is {{attached}} by a ring ("fly link" [...] (UK)) to a lip strap, which helps keep the lip <b>strap</b> <b>in</b> place while the lip <b>strap</b> <b>in</b> turn prevents the curb chain from being lost if it becomes unhooked.|$|R

2500|$|Despite the loss, Haye {{was widely}} praised for his {{performance}} in fighting on whilst severely injured.

2500|$|Houdini's final {{buried alive}} was an {{elaborate}} stage escape that featured in his full evening show. Houdini would escape after being <b>strapped</b> <b>in</b> a straitjacket, sealed in a casket, and then {{buried in a}} large tank filled with sand. While posters advertising the escape exist (playing off the Bey challenge by boasting [...] "Egyptian Fakirs Outdone!"), {{it is unclear whether}} Houdini ever performed buried alive on stage. The stunt was to be the feature escape of his 1927 season, but Houdini died on October 31, 1926. The bronze casket Houdini created for buried alive was used to transport Houdini's body from Detroit to New York following his death on Halloween.|$|E
2500|$|A {{class of}} {{ultralight}} sailplanes, including some known as microlift gliders and some as 'airchairs', {{has been defined}} by the FAI based on a maximum weight. They are light enough to be transported easily, and can be flown without licensing in some countries. Ultralight gliders have performance similar to hang gliders, but offer some additional crash safety as the pilot can be <b>strapped</b> <b>in</b> an upright seat within a deformable structure. Landing is usually {{on one or two}} wheels which distinguishes these craft from hang gliders. Several commercial ultralight gliders have come and gone, but most current development is done by individual designers and home builders.|$|E
