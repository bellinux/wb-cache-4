2500|$|The {{government}} of the Netherlands contracts for air ambulance service, which is provided by four helicopters, {{all of which are}} in service around the clock.

[...] Air units may perform high-acuity inter-facility transfers, or may also respond to the location where an emergency is occurring, to assist with immediate care or facilitate rapid transport of high-acuity victims.. [...] All air ambulance helicopters are staffed by both nurse and physicians. [...] The primary role of the helicopters is the rapid delivery of the Mobile Medical Team, and transport of the patient by aircraft, while possible, is not the preferred outcome. [...] In some cases, particularly for response to offshore emergencies, the civilian air ambulance system is supplemented by the three helicopters of the <b>Search</b> <b>and</b> <b>Rescue</b> <b>service</b> of the Netherlands Coastguard; using assets provided by the Dutch Navy and Dutch Air Force services. [...] All of these helicopters are transport-capable.
