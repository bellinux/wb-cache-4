40|$|Eosinophilic fasciitis, {{also known}} as Shulman's syndrome, is a fibrosing <b>scleroderma-like</b> <b>syndrome,</b> which is a {{distinct}} entity. A 55 -year-old man, presented with progressive skin darkening, thickening, and tightening over the left lower limb since 6 months. Dermatological examination revealed a hyperpigmented indurated area on the left thigh, extending to the anterior aspect of the left leg. A well-defined hypopigmented indurated plaque was present over the left iliac region. Histopathology and imaging studies confirmed the diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis and lichen sclerosus. The indurated lesion on the left lower limb responded dramatically well to oral corticosteroids. This is a rare case of unilateral eosinophilic fasciitis associated with ipsilateral extragenital lichen sclerosus...|$|E
40|$|Eosinophilic {{fasciitis}} {{is a rare}} {{connective tissue}} disease with unclear etiology and pathogenesis. It is classified as a <b>scleroderma-like</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The disease is characterized by fibrosis of the skin and subcutaneous tissues with significant thickening of fascia. Visceral involvement is rare. Characteristic feature in laboratory tests is peripheral blood eosinophilia. Differential diagnosis should be performed, including ruling out systemic sclerosis, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, scleromyxedema, hypereosinophilic syndrome or Churg-Strauss syndrome. Final diagnosis is confirmed by histopathological examination. In treatment of the disease corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive drugs are used. Some other drugs showed activity in this disease e. g. dapsone, infiximab or rituximab. Prognosis is rather good but sometimes a long-term treatment is necessary. In this paper we summarized the current knowledge on eosinophilic fasciitis...|$|E
40|$|Systemic {{sclerosis}} (Ssc) is an autoimmune {{connective tissue}} disease of unknown origin, characterized by progressive fibrosis {{of the skin}} and internal organs. Immune reactions taking part in Ssc pathogenesis may contribute to cancer development; therefore patients with risk factors for this disease require observation for a neoplastic process. On the other hand, symptoms of Ssc may be a mask of various cancers. Differentiating between the idiopathic form of Ssc and scleroderma-like paraneoplastic syndrome often causes a lot of difficulties. The article presents two cases of Ssc {{at the beginning of}} the disease after 60 years of age. The first case was diagnosed as Ssc, whereas in the second case the defined diagnosis was <b>scleroderma-like</b> <b>syndrome</b> in the course of colorectal cancer. This paper presents an analysis of differential diagnostic procedures which were performed and led to the final diagnosis, mentions types of cancers co-occurring with Ssc and suggests a screening scheme for cancer development in patients with a diagnosis of Ssc...|$|E
40|$|<b>Scleroderma-like</b> <b>syndromes</b> are a {{group of}} {{disorders}} that mimic systemic sclerosis. Werner’s syndrome is a genetically inherited syndrome that can be misdiagnosed as systemic scleroderomia. The syndrome is charachterized by sclerosis or stiffening of the skin, progeris, bilatera l juvenile cataract, endocrinopathies, premature coronary artery disease, alopecia, nail plate changes, hyperpigmentation and susceptibility to malignant neoplasms. We describe a case of Werner’s syndrome who presented with chronic leg ulcer and was misdiagnosed as systemic sclerosis for many years. We stopped unnecessary treatments and chronic leg ulcer was biopsied to rule out of skin cancer and managed locally by antibiotics and daily car...|$|R
40|$|We have {{generated}} {{for the first}} time monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for topoisomerase I (topo I) from scleroderma patients, and tight skin mice which develop a <b>scleroderma-like</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The epitope specificity of these antibodies has been determined using a series of fusion proteins containing contiguous portions of topo I polypeptide. Western blot analysis demonstrated that both human and mouse mAbs bound strongly to fusion protein C encompassing the NH 2 -terminal portion of the enzyme, and weakly to fusion proteins F and G containing regions close to the COOH-terminal end of the molecule. This crossreactivity is related to a tripeptide sequence homology in F, G, and C fusion proteins. It is interesting that a pentapeptide sequence homologous to that in fusion protein C was identified in the UL 70 protein of cytomegalovirus, suggesting that activation of autoreactive B cell clones by molecular mimicry is possible. Both human and mouse mAbs exhibiting the same antigen specificity, also share an interspecies cross-reactive idiotope. These data suggest that B cell clones producing antitopo autoantibodies present in human and mouse repertoire are conserved during phylogeny, and are activated during the development of scleroderma disease...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. Stiff skin {{syndrome}} (SSS) {{is a rare}} <b>scleroderma-like</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{of unknown}} aetiology. A 16 -year-old boy presented with thoracic and abdominal asymmetry, and ‘orange peel ’ cutaneous lesions, with fibrotic stone-hard indurations at the buttocks, thighs and arms leading to secondary joint contractures of the extremities. Our aim was to analyse the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules and pro-fibrotic cytokines in the dermis and epidermis of SSS. Methods. The diagnosis of SSS was confirmed by clinical and histopathological examination. Collagen type 1 alpha- 2 chain (Col 1 A 2), fibronectin- 1, thrombospondin- 1, TGF-b, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), IL- 6,- 1 b, ET- 1, Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR- 3) and MCP- 1 expression was analysed in SSS and age- and sex-matched healthy control skin by real-time PCR. VEGF expression was also studied. Results. Histopathological examination showed flattened dermal papillae, a scarce presence of sub-epidermal microvessels and mild dermal fibrosis, but no inflammatory infiltrates. In the SSS dermis, the expression of IL- 1 b,- 6 and MCP- 1 was low, whereas VEGF was intensively expressed. No differences were observed for TGF-b, CTGF and ET- 1. In contrast, col 1 A 2, fibronectin- 1 and thrombospondin- 1 were overexpressed in the SSS dermis. Conclusion. In our SSS patient, an overexpression of ECM proteins was detected, whereas no inflammatory infiltrates or up-regulation of pro-fibrotic cytokines were found. The data suggest that fibrosis in SSS might be independent from inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-seven {{consecutive}} {{patients with}} Dupuytren’s Contra&me were investigated by tissue typing techniques to ascertain their HLA-A, B, C and DR antigen status. Whilst no definite HLA antigen {{was found in}} association with this disease, at least one possibly significant pattern of HLA DR antigens was found in these patients. This finding was also noted in patients with scleroderma, and the <b>scleroderma-like</b> <b>syndrome</b> induced by vinyl chloride exposure. Interest in Dupuytren’s Disease has increased in recent years. Research has shown (Bazin 1980) that the abnormal palmar fascia of the hand in Dupuytren’s Contracture contains increased amounts of Type III collagen. In addition, microanatomical studies by McGrouther (1982) have delineated further {{the structure of the}} palmar fascia. However, the primary cause of the condition is still not known. investigations. Twelve patients had a positive family history of Dupuytren’s Contracture and in three of these cases, a high alcohol intake was noted. Two patients suffered from diabetes mellitus, two from epilepsy and two from previous tuberculosis. A control group of normal Caucasian hospital workers was used. TABLE 1 Numbers of Dupuytren’s patients with associated conditions The disease has been related to a high alcohol intake and liver disease (Wolfe 1956), epilepsy (Hueston 1963), diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis, Peyronie’s Disease (Billig 1975) and manual work, especially that associated with polyvinyl chloride (Bennett 1982), and these relationships may indicate the possibility of an environmental origin. It has been also recognised for many years that the condition may be familial (Manson 193 1). Additional evidence of genetic implication {{stems from the fact that}} the disease is rare in certain racia...|$|E
