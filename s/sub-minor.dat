No/(Bm) no no/(D7) not a second time"/(Em). Pedler writes: [...] "We are expecting the D7 chord, the dominant in the key of G, to return to the G major tonic". However, in replacing it with an Em chord supporting an isolated E note on [...] "time", we have an interrupted cadence or dominant-to-relative <b>sub-minor</b> (V7 to vi) shift. The major key of the song is G, but it appears to resolve on the Em (vi) chord. As Allan Moore puts it, [...] "Mann would argue that it is not the same thing as a 'V-vi' Interrupted or Deceptive cadence because—at that precise point in the song—the role of the E minor as a 'vi' is being questioned and is veering towards tonic status." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Identification and {{characterization}} of germplasm {{is an important}} link between the conservation and utilization of plant genetic resources. The present investigation was undertaken for identification and genetic variation within eight high yielding varieties of ginger through RAPD markers. A total of 55 distinct DNA fragments ranging from 0. 5 - 2. 4 Kb were amplified by using twelve selected primers. The cluster analysis indicated that the eight varieties formed two major clusters. The first major cluster had only one variety ‘S- 558 ’ with 43 % similarity with other seven varieties. Second major cluster having seven varieties and divided into two minor clusters. One minor cluster had six varieties (IISR-Varada, Suprabha, Suruchi, Suravi, Himagiri, IISR Mahima, IISR Rejatha) and other having only one variety ‘Nadia’. The second minor cluster further divided into two <b>sub-minor</b> clusters. ‘IISR Mahima ’ and ‘Himagiri ’ had 78 % similarity among themselves and 70 % similarity with ‘Suprabha ’ and ‘IISR Rejatha’. ‘Suprabha ’ and ‘IISR Rejatha ’ were having 81 % similarity among themselves. However, ‘Suravi ’ had 64 % similarity with ‘Suprabha’, ‘IISR Rejatha’, ‘IISR Mahima ’ and ‘Himagiri’. The present study showed the distant variation within the varieties. This investigation will help to breeders for ginger improvement program. Key words: Zingiber officinale Genetic variation RAPD INTRODUCTION more effective than traditional morphological marker...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend earlier work on groups acting on Gaussian {{graphical}} models to Gaussian Bayesian networks and more general Gaussian models defined by chain graphs. We discuss the maximal group which leaves a given model invariant and provide basic statistical applications of this result. This includes equivariant estimation, maximal invariants and robustness. The computation {{of the group}} requires finding the essential graph. However, by applying Studeny's theory of imsets we show that computations for DAGs can be performed efficiently without building the essential graph. In our proof we derive simple necessary and sufficient conditions on vanishing <b>sub-minors</b> of the concentration matrix in the model...|$|R
40|$|This work {{reports the}} {{chemistry}} and mineralogy of mineral efflorescences associated with slag deposits at the historical Río Tinto smelter site, southwest Spain. The slags {{have been subject}} to weathering since dumping in the 19 th and 20 th century, and a series of evaporative mineral efflorescences has been observed. The efflorescences commonly occur as powdery or cemented salt precipitates at seepage points {{at the base of the}} slag dump and as solid aggregates in protected overhangs facing the Tinto river. The mineral salt types include Ca and Mg sulfates (gypsum, epsomite, hexahydrite, bloedite) as well as mixed Fe 2 + – Fe 3 + hydrated sulfates (copiapite, roemerite). The salt mixtures have variable metal concentrations, including major (> 1 wt %) concentrations of Zn, minor Cu (> 1000 ppm), <b>sub-minor</b> (100 – 1000 ppm) to traces (< 100 ppm) of As and Co as well as traces (< 100 ppm) of Ag, Bi, Cd, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, Tl and W. Copiapite-rich samples exhibit the highest As, Cd and Cu, epsomite–hexahydrite rich samples have the highest Zn, and the gypsum-rich samples show the lowest metal and metalloid concentrations. Dissolution experiments show that all salt mixtures are acid generating due to Fe and Al hydrolysis and resultant pH decrease in the solution. Thus, weathering and leaching of metalliferous smelting slags are accompanied by the mobilisation of metals, metalloids, alkali earth elements and sulfate into pore and seepage waters. Evaporation of seepage waters emanating from the slag dump causes the precipitation of mobilised elements and compounds and leads to their temporary fixation in secondary soluble minerals. Dissolution of the efflorescences during the next rainfall and flushing event and associated Al 3 + and Fe 3 + hydrolysis contribute to the acidification and metal and sulfate contamination of Río Tinto waters...|$|E
