I actually furled the mizen-royal with my own hands--the ship carrying standing royals--and it was said to be very respectably done; a little rag-baggish in the bunt, perhaps, but secured in a way that took the next fellow who touched the gasket five minutes to cast the sail loose. Then it rained, and sails were to be loosened to dry. I let everything fall forward with my own hands, and, when we came to roll up the canvass again, I actually managed all three of the royals alone; one at a time, of course. My father had taught me to make a flat-knot, a bowline, a clove-hitch, two half-hitches, and such sort of things; and I got through with both a long and a <b>short</b> <b>splice</b> tolerably well.

40|$|Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases {{catalyze}} the aminoacylation of tRNAs {{with their}} cognate amino acids. They are {{an essential part}} of each translation system and in eukaryotes are therefore found in both the cytosol and mitochondria. Thus, eukaryotes either have two distinct genes encoding the cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms of each of these enzymes or a single gene encoding dually localized products. Trypanosomes require trans-splicing of a cap containing leader sequence onto the 5 ′-untranslated region of every mRNA. Recently we speculated that alternative trans-splicing could lead to the expression of proteins having amino-termini of different lengths that derive from the same gene. We now demonstrate that alternative trans-splicing, creating a long and a <b>short</b> <b>spliced</b> variant, is the mechanism for dual localization of trypanosomal isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS). The protein product of the longer spliced variant possesses an amino-terminal presequence and is found exclusively in mitochondria. In contrast, the <b>shorter</b> <b>spliced</b> variant is translated to a cytosol-specific isoform lacking the presequence. Furthermore, we show that RNA stability is one mechanism determining the differential abundance of the two spliced isoform...|$|R

5000|$|... {{long splice}} - A splice used to join two rope ends forming one rope {{the length of}} the total of the two ropes. The long splice, unlike most splice types, results in a splice that is only very {{slightly}} thicker than the rope without the splice, but sacrifices some of the strength of the <b>short</b> <b>splice.</b> It does this by replacing two of the strands of each rope end with those from the other, and cutting off some of the extra strands that result. The long splice allows the spliced rope to still fit through the same pulleys, which is necessary in some applications.|$|E
50|$|In the Middle Ages ({{from the}} 13th to the 18th centuries), from the British Isles to Italy, ropes were {{constructed}} in ropewalks, very long buildings where strands {{the full length}} of the rope were spread out and then laid up or twisted together to form the rope. The cable length was thus set by the length of the available rope walk. This is related to the unit of length termed cable length. This allowed for long ropes of up to 300 yards long or longer to be made. These long ropes were necessary in shipping as short ropes would require splicing to make them long enough to use for sheets and halyards. The strongest form of splicing is the <b>short</b> <b>splice,</b> which doubles the cross-sectional area of the rope at the area of the splice, which would cause problems in running the line through pulleys. Any splices narrow enough to maintain smooth running would be less able to support the required weight.|$|E

If the mainbrace was shot away, it was usually necessary to repair it during the engagement; the ship was unmaneuverable without it and would have to stay on the same tack.

The CFLAR gene is expressed as long and <b>short</b> <b>splice</b> forms encoding the anti-apoptotic proteins c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS (CFLARL and CFLARS, respectively) that play important roles in drug resistance. In univariate analyses of CFLAR mRNA expression in adult AML patients, those individuals with higher than median mRNA expression of the long splice form CFLAR(L) (but not the <b>short</b> <b>splice</b> form) had significantly lower 3 year overall survival (P = 0. 04) compared to those with low expression. In cell line studies, simultaneous down-regulation of c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS proteins using siRNA induced apoptosis in U 937 and NB- 4 AML cells, but not K 562 or OCI-AML 3 cells. However, dual c-FLIPL/S downregulation sensitized all four cell lines to apoptosis induced by recombinant tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (rTRAIL). Moreover, specific downregulation of c-FLIPL was found to recapitulate the phenotypic effects of dual c-FLIPL/S downregulation. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 / 2 / 3 / 6 inhibitor Vorinostat was found to potently down-regulate c-FLIPL expression by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms and to sensitize AML cells to rTRAIL. Further analyses using more selective HDAC inhibitors revealed that HDAC 6 inhibition was not required for c-FLIPL down-regulation. These results suggest that c-FLIPL may have clinical relevance both as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for HDAC inhibitors in AML although this requires further study...|$|E

Retroviral-mediated transduction of Casper-S/c-FLIPs into Casper(−/−) EFs restored resistance to TRAIL.

The effect of confinement (no confinement, internal steel stirrups or external PTMS), bar diameter and concrete cover were examined. The results show that, whilst unconfined control beams failed prematurely due to cover splitting, the use of PTMS confinement enhanced the bond strength of the spliced bars by up to 58 % and resulted in a less brittle behaviour. Based on the test results, a new analytical model is proposed to predict the additional bond strength provided by PTMS confinement.

Investigation of human Fc alpha R (CD 89) transcripts in neutrophils, eosinophils and a monocyte-like cell line, THP- 1, {{with the use}} of reverse transcriptase PCR, Northern blotting and RNase protection analysis, has provided evidence in these cell types for at least two distinct transcripts generated by alternative splicing. The cDNAs derived from the two major transcripts of both neutrophils and eosinophils have been cloned and sequenced. For both cell types, the larger clone represents the previously described full-length receptor, whereas the second, <b>shorter,</b> <b>splice</b> variant lacks the entire second, membrane-proximal, Ig-like domain. Stable CHO-K 1 transfectants have been obtained for both full-length and truncated variant neutrophil receptors. Whereas the full-length receptor is recognized by a panel of five anti-Fc alpha R monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), the shorter variant is bound weakly by only two of the antibodies, suggesting that the epitopes recognized by the majority of the mAbs lie at least in part in the second Ig-like domain of Fc alpha R.

Phosphorylation experiments identified the shorter form as the CaMKII specific substrate. Both forms are shown to be stably integrated into the holoenzyme. Two splice variants of alphaKAP were found in rabbit fast-twitch muscle and only one in slow-twitch muscle, using RT-PCR. Mobilities on SDS-PAGE are those expected. The <b>shorter</b> <b>splice</b> variants lacks the 33 -nucleotide sequence inserted by alternative splicing present in full-length alphaKAP, akin to differences between variants A and B of brain alphaCaMKII.

Removal of these regulatory domains by alternative splicing generates Cav 1. 342 A channels that activate at a more negative voltage range and exhibit more pronounced Ca 2 +-dependent inactivation. Here we describe the discovery of a novel <b>short</b> <b>splice</b> variant (Cav 1. 343 S) that is expressed at high levels in the brain but not in the heart. It lacks the DCRD but, in contrast to Cav 1. 342 A, still contains PCRD. When expressed together with α 2 δ 1 and β 3 subunits in tsA- 201 cells, Cav 1. 343 S also activated at more negative voltages like Cav 1. 342 A but Ca 2 +-dependent inactivation was less pronounced. Single channel recordings revealed much higher channel open probabilities for both <b>short</b> <b>splice</b> variants as compared with Cav 1. 3 L. The presence of the proximal C terminus in Cav 1. 343 S channels preserved their modulation by distal C terminus-containing Cav 1. 3 - and Cav 1. 2 -derived C-terminal peptides. Removal of the C-terminal modulation by alternative splicing also induced a faster decay of Ca 2 + influx during electrical activities mimicking trains of neuronal action potentials. Our findings extend the spectrum of functionally diverse Cav 1. 3 L-type channels produced by tissue-specific alternative splicing. This diversity may help to fine tune Ca 2 + channel signaling and, in the case of short variants lacking a functional C-terminal modulation, prevent excessive Ca 2 + accumulation during burst firing in neurons. This may be especially important in neurons that are affected by Ca 2 +-induced neurodegenerative processes...|$|E

As a first step towards understanding the possible emergent properties arising from this assembly of ligand binding domains, we have used NMR methods to solve the first structure of a SAM domain tandem.

The basic nuclear import signal for AIDA- 1 is buried at the interface between the two SAM domains.

R-Ras is a Ras-family small GTPase that has essential roles in multiple phases of axonal development. We recently identified afadin, an F-actin-binding protein, as an effector of R-Ras mediating axon branching through F-actin reorganization. Afadin comprises two isoforms-l-afadin, having the F-actin-binding domain, and s-afadin, lacking the F-actin-binding domain. Compared with l-afadin, s-afadin, the <b>short</b> <b>splicing</b> variant of l-afadin, contains RA domains but lacks the F-actin-binding domain. Neurons express both isoforms; however, the function of s-afadin in brain remains unknown. Here we identify s-afadin as an endogenous inhibitor of cortical axon branching. In contrast to the abundant and constant expression of l-afadin throughout neuronal development, the expression of s-afadin is relatively low when cortical axons branch actively. Ectopic expression and knockdown of s-afadin suppress and promote branching, respectively. s-Afadin blocks the R-Ras-mediated membrane translocation of l-afadin and axon branching by inhibiting the binding of l-afadin to R-Ras. Thus s-afadin acts as a dominant-negative isoform in R-Ras-afadin-regulated axon branching...|$|R
