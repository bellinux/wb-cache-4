5000|$|As {{payment for}} the U.S. {{benefits}} realized by the Canadian <b>storage</b> <b>operation,</b> the Treaty required the U.S. to: 1) deliver to Canada one-half of the estimated increase in U.S. downstream power benefits, {{on an ongoing basis}} (the Canadian Entitlement), and 2) make a one-time monetary payment as each of the dams were completed for one-half {{of the value of the}} estimated future flood damages prevented in the U.S. The Canadian Entitlement is calculated five years in advance for each operating year using an agreed treaty calculation method, and the amount varies mainly as a function of forecasted power loads, thermal generating resources, and operating procedures. The method gives Canada a [...] "first-added" [...] storage benefit that ignores U.S. dams built after 1961 (e.g. Libby and Dworshak), limits sales of surplus power to California, and excludes modern fish related constraints at U.S. dams. Without the first two of these limits, the Canadian Entitlement would be slightly less than one-half current values. The Canadian Entitlement during the August 2012 through July 2013 operating year is 504.5 average annual megawatts of energy (reduced by 3.4% for transmission losses, net=~4,269 GWh), shaped hourly at peak rates up to 1321 MW (minus 1.9% for transmission losses, net = 1296 MW).

40|$|This report {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} the USDA stabilization program on corn year-end carryover stocks and corn utilization. It also presents data on the cost of the program to the USDA. The objectives of the program were to stabilize corn and other feed grain utilization and prices and to raise the long-run level of those prices. In pursuit of these objectives, a program of non-recourse loans to farmers on corn sealed in cribs on their farms was undertaken, supplemented later by provisions for purchase agreements and loans stored in commercial warehouses. This stabilization program was backed up in some years by acreage control programs designed to reduce corn production. The 2 ̆ 2 total realized cost 2 ̆ 2 of the corn price and production programs to the USDA from 1932 to 1955 was 1. 3 billion. Most of this consisted of payments under the acreage control program; the cost of the CCC price-support <b>storage</b> <b>operations</b> was only 227 million.
