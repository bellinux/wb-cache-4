25|$|Serial Attached SCSI (SAS). The SAS {{is a new}} {{generation}} <b>serial</b> <b>communication</b> protocol for devices designed to allow for much higher speed data transfers and is compatible with SATA. SAS uses a mechanically identical data and power connector to standard 3.5-inch SATA1/SATA2 HDDs, and many server-oriented SAS RAID controllers are also capable of addressing SATA HDDs. SAS uses <b>serial</b> <b>communication</b> instead of the parallel method found in traditional SCSI devices but still uses SCSI commands.|$|E
25|$|The Serial Peripheral Interface bus (SPI) is a {{synchronous}} <b>serial</b> <b>communication</b> {{interface specification}} used for short distance communication, primarily in embedded systems. The interface {{was developed by}} Motorola in the late 1980s {{and has become a}} de facto standard. Typical applications include Secure Digital cards and liquid crystal displays.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes SPI {{is called}} a {{four-wire}} serial bus, contrasting with three-, two-, and one-wire serial buses. The SPI may be accurately described as a synchronous serial interface, but it {{is different from the}} Synchronous Serial Interface (SSI) protocol, which is also a four-wire synchronous <b>serial</b> <b>communication</b> protocol. SSI Protocol employs differential signaling and provides only a single simplex communication channel.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the right}} side of the {{instrument}} panel is an ITT Cannon D-subminiature plug providing RS-232 <b>serial</b> <b>communication,</b> into which a computer can be plugged into to download engine monitoring information. The software to run this is included on a CD-ROM that comes with the plane. This has been upgraded to an EDI card (engine Data Information). This card is a memory card much like in a digital camera, and records all engine data from 0 hours, until the 2000 hour TBO and can be read with a card reader to diagnose problems and observe flight characteristics in real time.|$|E
25|$|Customization was {{required}} because hardware choices were not constrained by compatibility with any one popular standard. For example, some manufacturers used separate computer terminal, while others designed a built-in integrated video display system. Serial ports for printers and modems could use {{different types of}} UART chips, and port addresses were not fixed. Some machines used memory-mapped I/O instead of the 8080 I/O address space. All of these variations in the hardware were concealed from other modules of the system by use of the BIOS, which used standard entry points for the services required to run CP/M such as character I/O or accessing a disk block. Since support for <b>serial</b> <b>communication</b> to a modem was very rudimentary in the BIOS or may have been absent altogether, it was common practice for CP/M programs that used modems to have a user-installed overlay containing all the code required to access a particular machine's serial port.|$|E
