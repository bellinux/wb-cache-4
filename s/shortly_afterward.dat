5|$|<b>Shortly</b> <b>afterward,</b> {{the highway}} descends gently from the Berkshires to meet another major state road, NY7, and {{overlaps}} {{with it for}} a short distance. Two miles after that concurrency ends, NY22 follows the upper Hoosic River to Hoosick Falls, the first village it has passed through since Millerton. There are no other state routes here, but after another , at North Hoosick, NY67 comes in from {{the east and the}} two roads overlap as they leave Rensselaer County.|$|E
5|$|Accounts vary, but historians {{estimate}} that by spring 1903, between 700 and 1,000 men {{arrived in the}} Tanana Valley. This put an enormous strain on Barnette's stock of food, which rapidly rose in price with demand. Miners objected to Barnette charging $12 per bag of flour and requiring them to buy cases of canned food. They gathered outside his store and demanded he lower his prices or they would burn it down. He responded that he had riflemen inside the building, and both groups reached a compromise. <b>Shortly</b> <b>afterward,</b> Barnette headed south with his wife on a dog team, intending to gather investors to purchase more supplies.|$|E

A representative of East Mississippi attended a track and field meet where Akins won the 100 metres and offered him a scholarship to play college football <b>shortly</b> <b>afterward.</b>|$|E
5|$|As VT74 {{returns to}} the rural {{countryside}} it bends toward the northeast {{for most of the}} distance to Cornwall. Through this stretch the highway winds through forests and occasional farmland. VT74 straightens at an intersection with Bates Road. A connector road called North Palmer Road merges with VT74 <b>shortly</b> <b>afterward.</b> VT74 winds again for a stretch and straightens a second time near the intersection with Elmendorf Road as it continues toward Cornwall, intersecting with several township highways and approaching increasingly residential areas. At Clark Road in Cornwall, VT74 turns to the northeast once again, passing through more forests before terminating at VT30 in Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|As the {{conflict}} raged, other Arab governments attempted {{to negotiate a}} peaceful resolution. As part of this effort, Gamal Abdel Nasser led the first emergency Arab League summit in Cairo on 21 September. Arafat's speech drew sympathy from attending Arab leaders. Other heads of state took sides against Hussein, among them Muammar Gaddafi, who mocked him and his schizophrenic father King Talal. A ceasefire was agreed upon between the two sides, but Nasser died of a massive heart attack hours after the summit, and {{the conflict}} resumed <b>shortly</b> <b>afterward.</b>|$|E
5|$|But the Parthian Empire, {{weakened}} by internal strife and wars with Rome, {{was soon to}} be followed by the Sassanid Empire. Indeed, <b>shortly</b> <b>afterward,</b> Ardashir I, the local Iranian ruler of Persis (modern Fars Province, Iran) from Estakhr began subjugating the surrounding territories in defiance of Arsacid rule. He confronted Artabanus V at the Battle of Hormozdgān on 28 April 224AD, perhaps at a site near Isfahan, defeating him and establishing the Sassanid Empire. There is evidence, however, that suggests Vologases VI continued to mint coins at Seleucia as late as 228AD.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{very weak}} storm, forecasters were wary about Katrina, as Central America was devastated by Hurricane Mitch exactly one year earlier. There was {{considerable}} fear of additional flash flooding and mudslides across the mountainous region. Immediately after being declared a tropical depression, a tropical storm warning was issued for Nicaragua, and it was extended to the San Andrés islands of Colombia <b>shortly</b> <b>afterward.</b> Officials in Honduras evacuated 71 families from the district of Colón and another 17 families from other at-risk areas. Along the coastline of Honduras, a red alert was declared as torrential rains were anticipated to produce deadly mudslides in areas still recovering from Mitch nearly one year ago.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1819 Congress made {{a voyage}} {{under the command}} of Captain John D. Henley to China, {{becoming}} the first U.S. warship to visit that country.

5|$|Early on September 24, Karl {{continued}} its north-northeast track over the open north-central Atlantic {{and continued to}} gradually weaken. It started to {{come in contact with}} the baroclinic zone and began to lose tropical characteristics, while still a Category1 hurricane. Karl became extratropical <b>shortly</b> <b>afterward</b> over the northern Atlantic at about 47°N, with its winds dropping below hurricane strength shortly thereafter. The extratropical storm made landfall on the Faroe Islands with hurricane-force wind gusts. As an extratropical low, the cyclone moved northeastward and eastward across the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, eventually reaching Norway before it was absorbed into another extratropical low late on September 28.|$|E

5|$|However, Washington {{was running}} behind {{schedule}} {{as he had}} planned to attack and capture the British outposts before dawn and capture the garrison <b>shortly</b> <b>afterward.</b> By the time dawn broke he was still two miles from the town. Washington sent 350 men under the command of Brigadier General Hugh Mercer to destroy the bridge over Stony Creek in order to delay Cornwallis's army when he found out that Washington had escaped. Shortly before 8:00 AM, Washington wheeled the rest of the army to the right down the unused road. First in the column went General John Sullivan's division consisting of Arthur St. Clair's and Isaac Sherman's brigades. Following them were John Cadwalader's brigade and then Daniel Hitchcock's.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, editor Hugh Hefner began {{publishing}} Playboy and {{the magazine}} became popular {{because of its}} early Playmates, such as Mansfield, Marilyn Monroe, Bettie Page, and Anita Ekberg. Mansfield posed nude for the February 1955 issue of Playboy, modeling in pajamas raised so that the bottoms of her breasts showed. This increased the magazine's circulation and helped launch Mansfield's career. Beginning in February 1955, she formed a long-standing relationship with Playboy. <b>Shortly</b> <b>afterward,</b> she posed for the Playboy calendar, covering her breasts with her hands. Playboy featured Mansfield every February from 1955 to 1958, and again in 1960.|$|E
