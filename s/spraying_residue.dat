40|$|Budok {{caused by}} Synchytrium pogostemonis is the {{important}} and destructive disease on patchouli plant (Pogostemon cablin). Chemical control must be done in incidence with high disease intensity and prediction of outbreak. The experiment was done using benomyl (Benlate 50 WP) and cuprous oxide (Kocide 77 WP) 0. 1 %, 0. 2 % and mixture of both (1 g cuprous oxide and 1 g L- 1 benomyl). Patchouli plant was sprayed eight times with one week interval. Harvesting was done {{two weeks after the}} end of <b>spraying.</b> <b>Residue</b> analysis of Cu was done with AAS and benomyl residue with HPLC. The result showed that 0. 1 % benomyl significantly reduced the disease intensity. The other treatments showed lower result. Harvested patchouli plants treated with 0. 1 % benomyl showed higher yield compare with 0. 2 % benomyl and cuprous oxyde. Cu residue in dried leaves was between 460 ppm and 950 ppm. Residue of benomyl was 54 – 100 ppb. Diseased seedling still can be used after spraying by benomyl four times with 2 weeks interval. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Widespread use of postbloom zinc (Zn) {{nutritional}} sprays in {{tree fruit}} and nut orchards {{can lead to}} substantial surface contamination of apple leaf samples by Zn <b>spray</b> <b>residue,</b> which complicates diagnosis of tree Zn status and Zn nutritional requirements. Detergent washing alone substantially reduced the Zn, iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) concentrations of Zn-sprayed Golden Delicious apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) leaves compared to unwashed leaves. Adding a 0. 1 M HCl washing step further reduced leaf Zn concentration, but had no additional effect of leaf Fe and Al concentrations. There was evidence for nitrogen (N) and sodium (Na) contamination of the leaf samples, possibly from chemical components of the detergent washing solution. The {{results indicate that the}} detergent washing is critical for eliminating Fe or Al contamination introduced by dust or soil adhering to leaves collected from trees grown in dusty environments or impacted by soil splash. Adding the acid wash should improve the estimate of the physiologically meaningful Zn concentration in Zn-sprayed leaf tissue; however, the resulting leaf Zn concen-trations may still be biased by a small and possibly variable amount of Zn <b>spray</b> <b>residue...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Autumn leaf scars are an {{important}} pathogen infection site for European canker on apples. Trials were undertaken to evaluate the effects of adjuvants on spray coverage of new leaf scars, and determine if adjuvants could (1) impart any significant rainfastness to protectant captan sprays and (2) provide any redistribution of captan during a rain event post-leaf drop. Retention on fresh leaf scars was increased {{with the use of}} organosilicone-latex sticker adjuvants only. Rain had little effect on <b>spray</b> <b>residues</b> but these adjuvants could improve rainfastness of captan due to their effects on spray retention. Retention on stem wood and around leaf nodes was increased by up to seven-fold with the use of superspreader-type adjuvants, due to redistribution of spray runoff from leaves. High initial deposits resulted in post-rain residues on leaf scars three-fold higher than a captan spray alone. Redistribution of captan onto exposed leaf scars in rain appears likely with these adjuvants...|$|R

30|$|The {{effective}} use of fungi as bio-insecticides is largely dependent on the persistent activity of fungal <b>spray</b> <b>residues,</b> which can be influenced by some factors including the formulation, substrate, fungal isolate, UV radiation and the prevailing abiotic conditions (Acharya et al. 2015; Blanford 2012; Darbro and Thomas 2009; Jackson et al. 2010; Jaronski 2010; Jenkins and Thomas 1996; Morleydavies et al. 1996). A recent study stated that the persistence of B. bassiana products was reduced in the field compared with that observed in the laboratory; conidia remained viable for up to 3  months under laboratory conditions, but for only 1 – 2  weeks in the field (Acharya et al. 2015). An appropriate formulation is needed to ensure the even distribution of conidia throughout the treated area and to improve the persistent activity of conidia that were exposed to various environmental conditions.

40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} effect of 35 years of avocado grove culture on a sandy soil in Dade County. A second purpose was to learn more of the soil itself since no work has been published on its composition. There are many reasons to expect profound changes in the soil as a result of commercial production of avocados. Presumably the soil retains part of the fertilizer which is so liberally applied in this area. Some losses are probable {{as the result of the}} application of fertilizer. The leaching of bases is accelerated by acid-forming nitrogen sources such as sulfate of ammonia and ammonium nitrate. <b>Spray</b> <b>residues,</b> particularly copper, accumulate in the soil. The trees themselves contribute toward changes in the soil. Avocados produce and drop a relatively large quantity of organic matter. In addition to this they provide heavy shade which aids in the retention of the organic matter which reaches the ground. Trees contribute to losses from the soil as well as to the gains. The elements absorbed by the trees are lost, temporarily at least, from the soil. That portion which moves into the harvested crop is lost completely.

30|$|Depending on the {{availability}} of tobacco plant, representative amount of leaves, four leaves per plant staring from bottom to the tips by stalk position, from Billate and Shewa Robit were collected. The collected samples were washed with tap water and rinsed three times with deionized water to make them free of extraneous substances, including soil and dust particles, and foliar <b>spray</b> <b>residues</b> that may influence analytical results (Jones et al. 1991; Maier and Griepink 1995; Iyengar et al. 1998). Another three samples were, processed Virginia whose origin was Billate, Shewa Robit, and Nyala sample. These processed samples, which were ready for use after warping, were prepared in the laboratory of the cigarette factory in exactly the same procedure of Nyala manufacturing by an expert of laboratory in the factory. Both types of samples were sealed in washed, rinsed with distilled-deionized water and dried polyethylene bag and transported to the laboratory where further sample pre-treatments were made. Drying at temperatures under 80  °C may not remove all combined water and may result in poor homogenization and incorrect analytical results. Drying temperatures above 80  °C may result in thermal decomposition and reduction in dry weight (Jones et al. 1991). Accordingly, after chopping the samples with plastic knife, all the samples were dried in the oven for 24  h at 80  °C.

Despite label precautions not to apply them to blooming plants, neonicotinoids and other residual systemic insecticides may be applied for preventive control of lawn insect pests when spring-flowering weeds are present. Dietary exposure to neonicotinoids adversely affects bees, but the extent of hazard from field usage is controversial. We exposed colonies of the bumble bee Bombus impatiens to turf with blooming white clover that had been treated with clothianidin, a neonicotinoid, or with chlorantraniliprole, the first anthranilic diamide labeled for use on lawns. The sprays were applied at label rate and lightly irrigated. After residues had dried, colonies were confined to forage for six days, and then moved to a non-treated rural site to openly forage and develop. Colonies exposed to clothianidin-treated weedy turf had delayed weight gain and produced no new queens whereas those exposed to chlorantraniliprole-treated plots developed normally compared with controls. Neither bumble bees nor honey bees avoided foraging on treated white clover in open plots. Nectar from clover blooms directly contaminated by <b>spray</b> <b>residues</b> contained 171 ± 44 ppb clothianidin. Notably, neither insecticide adversely impacted bee colonies confined on the treated turf after it had been mown to remove clover blooms present {{at the time of}} treatment, and new blooms had formed. Our results validate EPA label precautionary statements not to apply neonicotinoids to blooming nectar-producing plants if bees may visit the treatment area. Whatever systemic hazard through lawn weeds they may pose appears transitory, however, and direct hazard can be mitigated by adhering to label precautions, or if blooms inadvertently are contaminated, by mowing to remove them. Chlorantraniliprole usage on lawns appears non-hazardous to bumble bees...|$|R

Therefore, {{here it was}} determined whether Ag nanoparticles with acaricidal activity could be synthesized using the Saponaria officinalis root extract. Size, shape and crystalline structure of the nanoparticles were described. Furthermore, the toxicity of S. officinalis extract vs. S. officinalis-fabricated Ag nanoparticles was studied, comparing their activity on eggs, larvae and adults of two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae. The impact of both treatments on T. urticae oviposition was investigated. Both the S. officinalis root extract and the nanoparticles showed a very good acaricidal efficacy. Ag nanoparticle LC 50 was 1. 2  g L− 1 (LC 90  =  2. 8  g L− 1), significantly less if compared with the root extract alone (LC 50 (90)  =  7. 8 (11. 9) g L− 1). Adults of T. urticae showed the lowest sensitivity, with LC 50 of 6. 1 and 19. 9  g L− 1 for nanoparticles and the aqueous root extract, respectively. Both treatments showed high ovicidal toxicity with LC 50 of 3. 1 and 13. 8  g L− 1 for the nanoparticles and aqueous root extract, respectively. Treatment <b>spray</b> <b>residues</b> also caused significant inhibition of oviposition in females of T. urticae with EC 50 estimated as 1. 4  g L− 1, a value significantly lower, if compared with the extract alone (EC 50  =  6. 1  g L− 1). No phytotoxicity of both treatments was observed in short-term tests.

40|$|AbstractAnopheles farauti is {{the primary}} malaria vector {{throughout}} the coastal regions of the Southwest Pacific. A shift in peak biting time from late to early in the night occurred following widespread indoor <b>residue</b> <b>spraying</b> of dichlorodiphenyltrichloro-ethane (DDT) and has persisted in some island populations despite the intervention ending decades ago. We used mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequence data and 12 newly developed microsatellite markers to assess the population genetic structure of this malaria vector in the Solomon Archipelago. With geographically distinct differences in peak A. farauti night biting time observed in the Solomon Archipelago, we tested the hypothesis that strong barriers to gene flow exist in this region. Significant and often large fixation index (FST) values were found between different island populations for the mitochondrial and nuclear markers, suggesting highly restricted gene flow between islands. Some discordance in the location and strength of genetic breaks was observed between the mitochondrial and microsatellite markers. Since early night biting A. farauti individuals occur naturally in all populations, the strong gene flow barriers that we have identified in the Solomon Archipelago lend weight to {{the hypothesis that the}} shifts in peak biting time from late to early night have appeared independently in these disconnected island populations. For this reason, we suggest that insecticide impregnated bed nets and indoor <b>residue</b> <b>spraying</b> are unlikely to be effective as control tools against A. farauti occurring elsewhere, and if used, will probably result in peak biting time behavioural shifts similar to that observed in the Solomon Islands...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the amount of external <b>spray</b> <b>residues</b> that accumulate on farm sprayers and tractors. Six different sprayers were examined, Airtec, conventional sprayer (three types of nozzles, TeeJet XR, Lurmark DriftBeta and Hardi Injet), Danfoil, Hardi Twin, Kyndestoft and Släpduk. The study does not include accidental spillage from supply tanks or leakage from pipes etc. that may occur in everyday practise. A tracer dye, Nigrosin WLF, was added to the spray liquid. After spraying the sprayer and tractor were washed over a catchment pool containing a fixed volume of water. A small centrifugal pump was used to re—circulate the water. The concentrations of Nigrosin in the rinse water and in the spray liquid were determined by using a spectrophotometer. By comparing these concentrations, the amount of Nigrosin immobilised on the tractor and sprayer was determined. The sprayer was divided into two areas that were rinsed separately, the booms and the tank (every part of the sprayer except for the booms). The tractor was also divided into two areas, the front (radiator, bonnet and engine) and the back (the rest). All wheels were excluded. An average of between 0, 01 % - 0, 60 % of the sprayed tracer dye (active substance) was found on the tractor and sprayer after spraying had been carried out. The largest accumulation, 50 - 98 % of the accumulated deposition, was observed on the booms. The largest deposition was observed on the air-assisted sprayers, Kyndestoft (0, 60 % of the sprayed amount) and Hardi Twin (0, 46 %). Släpduk received the third largest deposition (0, 36 %). 0, 06 % of the sprayed tracer dye was observed on Danfoil and Airtec. The deposition on the conventional sprayer with TeeJet XR nozzles was 0, 04 % and on the same sprayer with Lurmark DriftBeta 0, 02 %. Hardi lnjet nozzles mounted on the conventional sprayer gave a deposition of 0, 01 %. Residues on contaminated sprayers can be released by rain and may cause local doses that significantly exceed approved amounts. To avoid contamination of surface and ground waters, it is wise to practise decontamination not on the farmyard where the topsoil often has been replaced by gravel, but on the field.

In leaf samples from single <b>sprayed</b> plots, metalaxyl <b>residues</b> declined rapidly following the treatment and more than 50 % of the residues disappeared in the first two days, whereas in the leaf from single granule-applied plants, the residues increased during the first three weeks and then declined. Metalaxyl residues in cucumber sampled from single sprayed-plots were at a high level during the first three days after the spray and declined below the MRL (0. 5 mg/kg) on the 7 th day. In granule-applied plots, the residues increased during the first 7 days and the level below the limit was recorded 20 days after application. Residual values for plants sprayed with suspension showed a faster dissipation rate than granulated treatment. Metalaxyl recovered after three times of spraying and two times of granular application did not show any toxic accumulation of residues in fruit...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the transfer and metabolism of triadimefon residues from rape flowers to apicultural products. In the field trials, honeybee colonies were placed in four rape greenhouses treated with triadimefon on standard dosage. Apicultural products (pollen, honey, and royal jelly) were collected on a regular basis. Sample preparation and extraction procedure were established. HPLC/ESI-MS/MS method was validated. The respective residues of triadimefon and metabolite triadimenol were 0. 03 ± 0. 002 [*]mg/kg and 0. 13 ± 0. 02 [*]mg/kg in pollen on the 18 th day, and both had reached the limits of detection in honey on the 24 th day, while they were 0. 004 ± 0. 0005 [*]mg/kg and 0. 010 ± 0. 0002 [*]mg/kg in royal jelly on the 22 nd day. Mathematical curve fitting studies were further investigated. On the basis of recommended dosage, the degradation half-lives of triadimefon in pollen, honey, and royal jelly were about 0. 7, 12. 5, and 19. 5 days, respectively. Transfer of triadimefon residues from rape flowers to apicultural products diminished over <b>spraying</b> time. The <b>residues</b> of triadimefon and metabolite triadimenol in pollen were about 10 times higher than those in honey and jelly. Time to attain the maximum permissible limit of pollen in the European Union was 14. 9 days, predicted from the index function...|$|R
40|$|Urban Agriculture {{is crucial}} to the supply of food {{especially}} fresh vegetables in many urban areas including Accra. In addition to the supply of food, it serves as a source of employment and income for many urban dwellers. However, most urban farmers resort to the use of pesticides in controlling the pest pressures they face. The Dzorwulu Plant Pool Site in Accra was used as a case study to explore the attitudes of urban farmers towards the use of pesticide, assess the threats they face by using pesticide and together with them, identify alternative ways of controlling pest. By employing convenience and purposive sampling techniques, 15 farmers and 5 other stakeholders were selected for data collection through participant observation, interviews and focus group discussions. Secondary data was used in the study. The use of chemical pesticides was found to be the sole means by which the farmers controlled pest. The farmers feel spraying with chemicals is not only effective, it is also the only viable option available to them at the moment. Even though they are aware of other pest control strategies such as Integrated Pest Management (IPM), they lacked in-depth knowledge about the principles of IPM and hence employ it to control pests. The use of pesticides poses serious health hazards to both farmers and consumers of fresh vegetables, in addition to the serious environmental damage it causes. The Dzorwulu farmers reported health conditions such as dizziness, skin and nausea irritations after spraying. This is mainly due to the inappropriate handling and mixing of the chemicals as well as the non-use of personal protective clothing on the part of farmers during <b>spraying.</b> Pesticide <b>residues</b> on vegetables and other food products due to indiscriminate spraying also pose serious health threat to consumers and the environment. Even though the farmers rely only on pesticide as a way of controlling pest, they are willing to adopt sustainable pest control strategies such as IPM. However, they are calling for serious research and training on the part of government so that whatever alternative strategy introduced to them can be effective in controlling to pest to facilitate adoption...|$|R
40|$|GRAIN LEGUME ROTATIONS {{underpin}} {{the sustainability}} of the Australian sugarcane farming system, offering a number of soil health and environmental benefits. Recent studies have highlighted the potential for these breaks to exacerbate nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions. An experiment was implemented in 2012 to evaluate the impact of two fallow management options (bare fallow and soybean break crop) and different soybean residue management practices on N 2 O emissions and sugarcane productivity. The bare fallow plots were conventionally tilled, whereas the soybean treatments were either tilled, not tilled, <b>residue</b> <b>sprayed</b> with nitrification inhibitor (DMPP) prior to tillage or had a triticale ‘catch crop’ sown between the soybean and sugarcane crops. The fallow plots received either no nitrogen (N 0) or fully fertilised (N 145) whereas the soybean treatments received 25 kg N/ha at planting only. The Fallow N 145 treatment yielded 8 % more cane than the soybean tilled treatment. However there was no statistical difference in sugar productivity. Cane yield was correlated with stalk number that was correlated to soil mineral nitrogen status in January. There was only 30 % more N/ha in the above-ground biomass between the Fallow N 145 and the Fallow N 0 treatment; highlighting poor fertiliser nitrogen use efficiency. Supplying adequate nitrogen to meet productivity requirements without causing environmental harm remains a challenge for the Australian sugar industry. The soybean direct drill treatment significantly reduced N 2 O emissions and produced similar yields and profitability to the soybean tilled treatment (outlined in a companion paper by Wang et. al. in these proceedings). Furthermore, this study has highlighted that the soybean direct drill technique provides an opportunity to enable grain legume cropping in the sugarcane farming system to capture all of the soil health/environmental benefits without exacerbating N 2 O emissions from Australian sugarcane soils...|$|R
