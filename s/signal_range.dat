25|$|Fast scan amateur {{television}} has gained popularity as hobbyists adapt inexpensive consumer video electronics like camcorders and video cards in PCs.

These requirements also effectively limit the <b>signal</b> <b>range</b> to between 20 and 60miles (30–100km).|$|E
500|$|After Garza {{confessed to}} police {{in a written}} {{statement}} on March 31, 1993, he was not arrested immediately because he agreed to cooperate with them in their efforts to apprehend Martínez. Garza reached out to Martínez and told her that the assassins wanted more money. He met with her three times in April 1993 wearing a wire, and had Martínez agree to contact Cisneros to give Garza the money. Police arrested Martínez on April 6 and agreed to work with them to incriminate Cisneros. The next morning, she scheduled a meeting with Cisneros and told her that the assassins requested more money, and she needed to pay. They rode around Brownsville and Cisneros's voice was recorded. The police kept close to the car to stay within the transmitter's <b>signal</b> <b>range.</b> Only portions of the conversation were recorded because the police were unable to remain within range all the time. While in the car, Cisneros gave Martínez an envelope with US$500. Cisneros then asked Martínez if there was any evidence that she had orchestrated the murder. Cisneros mentioned Garza and a man known as [...] "El Cortado," [...] though investigators had no idea who he was. In the recorded conversation, there was no incriminating evidence against the gunmen. since {{there was no evidence that}} Cisneros employed them, or that the assassins murdered Fischer. The meeting concluded when police pulled the vehicle over and arrested Cisneros. She told a police officer that she owed Martínez some money, which Martínez later admitted was not the case.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSecreted TGFβ {{proteins}} of the Nodal family pattern the vertebrate body axes and induce mesoderm and endoderm [1]. Nodal proteins {{can act as}} morphogens [2], but {{the mechanisms}} regulating their activity and <b>signaling</b> <b>range</b> are poorly understood. In particular, it has been unclear how inefficient processing or rapid turnover of the Nodal protein influences autocrine and paracrine signaling properties [3, 4]. Here, we evaluate the role of Nodal processing and stability in tissue culture and zebrafish embryos. Removal of the pro domain potentiates autocrine signaling but reduces Nodal stability and <b>signaling</b> <b>range.</b> Insertion of an N-glycosylation site present in several related TGFβ proteins increases the stability of mature Nodal. The stabilized form of Nodal acts at a longer range than the wild-type form. These results suggest that increased proteolytic maturation of Nodal potentiates autocrine signaling, whereas increased Nodal stability extends paracrine signaling...|$|R
