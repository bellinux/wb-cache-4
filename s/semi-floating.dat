25|$|Tethered plug drawing, {{also known}} as <b>semi-{{floating}}</b> mandrel drawing, is a mix between floating plug drawing and fixed plug drawing. The mandrel is allowed to float, but it still anchored via a tether. This process gives similar results to the floating plug process, except that it is designed for straight tubes. It gives a better inner surface finish than rod drawing.|$|E
500|$|The sixth {{season of}} Degrassi: The Next Generation {{commenced}} airing in Canada on 28 November 2006, concluded on 14 May 2007 and contains nineteen episodes.

Unlike the previous seasons, which took place over the course of an entire school year, season six only covers the first semester of the school year, utilizing a <b>semi-floating</b> timeline. It also marks the first death of a main character in the series.|$|E
500|$|The Storm was {{primarily}} meant to satisfy Israeli military needs, but capable {{long and short}} versions are produced for the local civilian market. Like the Jeep, it has a conventional front-engine design with a driver and passenger seated behind the engine, and room for cargo or passengers behind them. It is powered by an AMC 3.983 litre 6-cylinder in-line petrol with fuel injection developing [...] at 4,700rpm, fitted with Vortox 2-stage air cleaner or a Volkswagen 2.5 litre 4-cylinder turbocharged diesel developing 88kilowatts (118hp) at 4,200rpm. The front axle is fully floating and the rear axle is <b>semi-floating,</b> while a reinforced frame and body as well as good angles of approach and departure (40° and 37° for short frame, 40° and 26.5° for long frame) add to the Storm's off-roading capability.|$|E
50|$|The Dana/Spicer Model 53 is an {{automotive}} {{rear axle}} produced by Dana-Spicer used in medium to {{heavy duty truck}} applications. The Dana/Spicer Model 53 (Dana 53) is a <b>semi-float</b> axle that was produced from 1947-1965, both with a 53 differential and wheel ends, and with a Dana 44 differential and Dana 53 wheel ends.|$|R
5000|$|The Dana 61 {{was made}} in <b>semi-float</b> and full-float axles for select 4×2 and 4x4 Ford -ton and 1 Ton Pickups and Vans from 1974 to 1987. A Dana 61 front axle was {{selectively}} used in Dodge 4×4 -ton and 1 Ton pickups from 1987 to 1993. Although 3.07:1 and 3.31:1 gear sets are common for a Dana 61, lower gear sets deeper than (4.10:1 on down) are not.|$|R

60|$|When the diver {{received}} the encouraging {{pat on the}} head, as already related, he descended the ladder to its lowest round. Here, being a few feet below the surface, the buoyancy of the water relieved him {{of much of the}} oppression caused by the great weights with which he was loaded. He was in a <b>semi-floating</b> condition, hence the ladder, being no longer necessary, was made to terminate at that point. He let go his hold of it and sank gently to the bottom, regulating his pace by a rope which descended from the foot of the ladder to the mud, on which in a few seconds his leaden soles softly rested. A continuous stream of air-bubbles from the safety-valve behind the helmet indicated to those above that the pumps were doing their duty, {{and at the same time}} hid the diver entirely from their sight.|$|E

5000|$|Suzhou Oriental Semiconductor Co., Ltd (...) , {{abbreviated}} as Oriental Semiconductor (...) , is a startup company {{located in}} SIP, Suzhou, China. It invented the world's first <b>semi-floating</b> gate transistor (SFGT) with Fudan University in Shanghai. The related research paper was published on Science on August 9, 2013.|$|E
50|$|The full-floating {{design is}} {{typically}} used in most 3/4- and 1-ton light trucks, medium duty trucks and heavy-duty trucks, {{as well as}} most agricultural applications, such as large tractors and self-propelled agricultural machinery. There are a few exceptions, such as many Land-Rover vehicles and in American stock car racing since the early 1960s. The overall assembly can carry more weight than a <b>semi-floating</b> or non-floating axle assembly, because the hubs have two bearings riding on a fixed spindle. A full-floating axle can be identified by a protruding hub to which the axle shaft flange is bolted. The <b>semi-floating</b> design is found under most 1/2-ton and lighter trucks and SUVs and rear-wheel-drive passenger cars, usually being smaller or less expensive models.|$|E
50|$|Fully Floating Linkage Design. This linkage design {{features}} on the Joyride and Europa-FS (<b>semi-floating).</b> This unique variation on the 4-bar linkage delivers progressive suspension whereby the ride becomes firmer as the shock is depressed. The shock is not attached directly to the static part of the frame at any point, hence 'floating'.|$|E
50|$|The Dana 44 {{rear axle}} first saw {{use in the}} 1940s and is still in use today. The Dana 44 has a GAWR up to 3500 lb and is a <b>semi-floating</b> type, having one bearing {{on the end of}} the axle shaft which carries the weight of the vehicle on the axle and also allows axle rotation.|$|E
50|$|The Ford 9 inch {{rear axle}} {{is known as}} one of the most popular axles in {{automotive}} history. Ford ended its production in 1986 when it was replaced by the Ford 8.8 inch axle. However, aftermarket companies still produce this axle. The Ford 9 inch is a <b>semi-floating,</b> drop-out axle. It had a GAWR up to 3600 lbs.|$|E
50|$|The {{front wheel}} mounts dual disc brakes with cross-drilled, <b>semi-floating</b> 320 mm steel discs and radial-mounted four-piston calipers.

50|$|Dodge {{offered the}} 2500 series in two {{different}} gross-vehicle-weight ratings {{for the first few}} years, but this was later dropped. The purpose of the difference between the light-duty and heavy-duty 2500 trucks was for the heavy-duty 2500 {{to take the place of}} the discontinued one-ton single-rear-wheel trucks. Rear axles for the light-duty 2500 trucks were <b>semi-floating,</b> while the heavy-duty 2500 rear axles were full-floating.|$|E
50|$|The entire {{engine air}} intake and the axle system was fully vented {{to allow for}} {{operation}} while submerged under water. Its full-floating front axle (Dana 25) {{was supported by the}} wheel hub, rather than the axle itself, and provided greater load capacity. The rear axle (Dana 44) was <b>semi-floating.</b> Its drivetrain was the L-head 134.2 cuin L with a T-90 transmission and the Dana 18 transfer case.|$|E
50|$|The front brakes of the GT1000 {{were derived}} from the other SportClassic models, and had two Brembo {{floating}} calipers with 30 and 32 mm diameter thermally insulated pistons. They were <b>semi-floating</b> discs with a diameter of 320 mm and a thickness of 4 mm. The rear brake system consisted of a floating single piston Brembo 34 mm caliper with high friction sintered pads and a 245 mm disc (bigger rear disc for two-up riders).|$|E
50|$|The {{most recent}} {{significant}} achievement was {{the completion of}} the Gumusut-Kakap <b>semi-floating</b> production system (FPS).

50|$|The bike {{remained}} relatively unchanged until 2000, when Ducati added fuel injection to the M900 model. Perhaps more importantly, in 2001 Ducati also introduced the S4, which added the liquid-cooled four-valve Superbike engine to the stable. Other technical changes that year included <b>semi-floating</b> front disc brakes with Brembo four-piston calipers, lighter Brembo wheels {{as well as}} 43 mm Showa inverted forks. 2002 saw {{the introduction of the}} limited, 300 edition, high-spec, S4,named after four time Ducati Superbike Champion, Carl 'Foggy' Fogarty.|$|E

50|$|The Jeep CJ-10 was a CJ-bodied {{pickup truck}} {{based on a}} heavily {{modified}} Jeep J10 pickup truck. Produced from 1981 to 1985, it was sold and designed for export markets; Australia in particular. They featured square headlights mounted in the fenders and a nine-slot grille, a homage to the Willys MB used in World War II; all other civilian Jeeps had a seven-slot grille. The CJ-10 could have either a hardtop or a softtop. The truck could be equipped to handle either a 5900 lb or 6700 lb GVW. Three engines were offered; an 198 cuin L six-cylinder Nissan built diesel engine, an 151 cuin L four cylinder AMC built engine or a 258 cuin L six cylinder AMC built engine. The driveline was largely from the larger J series pickups; consisting of either a four speed Tremec T177 manual transmission or a three speed TorqueFlite A727 automatic transmission, a New Process 208 transfer case, a <b>semi-floating</b> Dana 44 front differential, and either a <b>semi-floating</b> Dana 44 or Dana 60 rear differential, depending on GVW rating. Importation of the CJ-10 into Australia ended in 1985 with the drop of the Australian dollar's value causing the vehicle to be significantly more costly than its competitors.|$|E
50|$|In {{the fully}} {{floating}} configuration, {{a bearing surface}} is created both between the small end eye and gudgeon pin and the journal in the piston. The gudgeon pins are usually secured with circlips. No interference fit is used in any instance and the pin 'floats' entirely on bearing surfaces. The average rubbing speed {{of each of the}} three bearings is halved and the load is shared across a bearing that is usually about three times the length of the <b>semi-floating</b> design with an interference fit with the piston.|$|E
5000|$|The Remington Model 513 Matchmaster is a bolt-action rifle, {{manufactured}} from 1940 to 1968. Since {{the rifle}} {{was designed for}} target shooting, it came equipped with a sturdy half stock with sling swivels, a beavertail fore end, and a straight comb which rose at the heel. Matchmaster barrels were a 27" [...] heavy target <b>semi-floating</b> type. The patented Matchmaster trigger mechanism had an adjustable stop. The Matchmaster was made to fire only the [...]22-caliber Long Rifle cartridge from a detachable magazine. Civilian versions of the Matchmaster have a blued finish, while those made for U.S. Army and ROTC service can have either a blued or a parkerized finish.|$|E
50|$|Although {{only two}} school {{years have passed}} in the story {{timeline}} since season six, season ten {{is set in the}} first semester, and first half of the second semester, in which the years it aired. Writers have been able to use a <b>semi-floating</b> timeline, so that the issues depicted are modern for their viewers. This season depicts the lives of a group of high school sophomores, juniors, seniors, and graduates as they deal with some of the challenges and issues that teenagers face such as domestic violence, dysfunctional families, self image, bullying, sexual harassment, gender identity/transsexualism, teenage pregnancy, online predators, homophobia, school violence, divorce, religion, kidney failure, self-harm, alcoholism, sexual identity, financial difficulties, running away and relationships.|$|E
50|$|De Tomaso himself decreed a 16-inch {{front wheel}} and new Lario-styling for the Le Mans 1000 Instead of {{redesigning}} the frame to incorporate a smaller front wheel, Guzzi simply fitted the smaller wheel into the existing frame (which {{was designed for}} an 18-inch wheel) without reconfiguring the geometry. Sturdier forks were fitted, as were smaller (270 mm) <b>semi-floating</b> front discs. The new bike was now physically {{much larger than the}} lean and low earlier Le Mans bikes, and performance was scarcely better than the Mark III predecessor. An 18-inch option became available in 1987. The Series 2 bikes included uprated Bitubo dampers and updated geometry. Most 1988 models were factory-fitted with the 18-inch wheel.|$|E
50|$|Most 70 Series Land Cruisers (both petrol {{and diesel}} models) use inline six-cylinder engines. The {{exceptions}} are the V8 diesel 1VD-FTV engine introduced in some markets in 2007 and the V6 petrol 1GR-FE introduced in 2009, with the last straight-6 available being the diesel 1HZ for markets with less stringent emission rules such as Africa and Bolivia. Regardless of the engine, a 5-speed manual transmission delivers power to a part-time four-wheel-drive transfer case with high and low range. The solid front axles are a full-floating design with manual locking hubs. The solid rear axles are available in <b>semi-floating</b> and full-floating variations. Selectable locking differentials (front and rear) are factory options in some markets.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} age of globalization, governments largely chose {{to pursue a}} stable {{exchange}} rate while allowing freedom of movement for capital. The sacrifice was that their monetary policy was largely dictated by international conditions, not by {{the needs of the}} domestic economy. In the Bretton woods period, governments were free to have both generally stable exchange rates and independent monetary policies at the price of capital controls. The impossible trinity concept was especially influential during this era as a justification for capital controls. In the Washington consensus period, advanced economies generally chose to allow freedom of capital and to continue maintaining an independent monetary policy while accepting a floating or <b>semi-floating</b> exchange rate.|$|E
