40|$|The {{unsteady}} {{behavior of}} a tip leakage flow downstream of a simulated axial compressor rotor has been studied. The Virginia Tech low speed linear cascade wind tunnel was adapted to model the unsteady tip leakage flow produced by a rotor operating in the vortical wakes of a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>stator</b> <b>vanes.</b> The cascade, consisting of 8 GE rotor B blades, has adjustable tip gap, inlet angle of 65. 1 o, turning angle of 11. 8 ° and solidity of 1. 076. The cascade Reynolds number, based on blade chord, was 393, 000. A moving end wall was used to simulate the relative motion between rotor and casing, and vortex generators attached to the moving end wall were used to produce an idealized periodic unsteady vortical inflow similar to that shed by the junction of a row of inlet guide vanes. Measurements of the vortical inflow to the cascade produced by the generators and of the mean blade loading at the mid span are presented. The periodic and aperiodic behavior of the tip leakage flow downstream of the cascade, produced by this vortical disturbance, is also presented using phase and time averaged 3 -component turbulence and pressure fluctuation measurements. These measurements are made for tip gap from 0. 83 % to 3. 3 % chord and streamwise locations from 0. 772 % to 1. 117 % blade spacin...|$|E

40|$|Control of flow {{separation}} using impulsive surface injection is investigated within the multistage environment {{of a low}} speed axial-flow compressor. Measured wake profiles behind a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> embedded <b>stator</b> <b>vanes</b> treated with suction-surface injection indicate significant reduction in {{flow separation}} {{at a variety of}} injection-pulse repetition rates and durations. The corresponding total pressure losses across the vanes reveal a bank of repetition rates at each pulse duration where the separation control remains nearly complete. This persistence allows for demands on the injected-mass delivery system to be economized while still achieving effective flow control. The response of the stator-vane boundary layers to infrequently applied short injection pulses is described in terms of the periodic excitation of turbulent strips whose growth and propagation characteristics dictate the lower bound on the band of optimal pulse repetition rates. The eventual falloff in separation control at higher repetition rates is linked to a competition between the benefits of pulse-induced mixing and the aggravation caused by the periodic introduction of low-momentum fluid. Use of these observations for impulsive actuator design is discussed and their impact on modeling the time-average effect of impulsive surface injection for multistage steady-flow simulation is considered...|$|R

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{increase in}} already high specific performance of aero engines and growing optimization demands require further {{innovation in the}} fields of materials and design of structures to reach the primarily aerodynamic driven goals. In general, the improvement of materials on its own cannot guarantee success but rather the combination of different materials offers the potential for increased performance and additional functionality. For using different material properties, an adapted hybrid design is necessary. Within this design outstanding material characteristics should be addressed, whilst the lower performance properties must not be critical and provoke faults. By combining different materials within hybrid structures, the feasible increase in performance is accompanied with the challenges of handling a lot more parameters for optimization. Three examples are described in this paper, showing hybrid design approaches for aero engine structures. The design principles can be transferred to similar structures by using the shown basic mechanisms. The first example covers a hybrid ring structure used for simultaneous movement <b>of</b> <b>stator</b> <b>vanes</b> within an axial compressor. BLISK technology with high aerodynamic efficiency and low structural damping requires an accurate positioning <b>of</b> the <b>stator</b> <b>vanes</b> to avoid dynamic excitation in transient surroundings during a complete flight cycle.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2015 Havacılığın devamlı gelişmesi ve hava taşımacılığının artarak önem kazanmasıyla, günümüzde uçaklar en çok kullanılan ulaşım araçlarından biri haline gelmiştir. Yolcu ve kargo taşımacılığı yapan ticari havayolları da ekonomik nedenlerle genelde 9 - 12 km gibi yüksek irtifalarda uçuşlarını gerçekleştirmektedirler. Ancak bu yüksekliklerde hava sıcaklığı - 56, 5 °C’lere kadar düştüğünden bu irtifadaki uçuşların uçağın kontrol yüzeylerinde, kanatlarında ve turbo-jet, turbo-fan veya {{turbo-prop}} motorların ilk kademelerinde buzlanmaya neden olabildiği görülmektedir. Uçağın kontrol yüzeylerindeki ve kanatlarındaki buzlanmayı önlemek için uçuşlardan önce bu yüzeylere buz önleyici kimyasal sıvılar püskürtülmektedir. Ayrıca farklı uçaklarda kanatlarda buzlanmayı önleyici kapakçıklar gibi farklı sistemler de bulunmaktadır. Motorda oluşan buzlanma, eksenel kompresörün ilk kademesinde statör kanatçıklarında görülmekte ve motor performansını olumsuz yönde etkilemektedir. Bunu önlemek için statör kanatçıklarına kanallar açılmıştır ve motorun ileri kademelerinden alınan sıcak hava buralardan tahliye edilerek statör kanatçıklarının firar kenarlarındaki buzlanma önlenmektedir.   Ancak  kanal ağızlarındaki keskin kenarlarda oluşan gerilme yoğunluğu buralarda çatlak oluşumu ve ilerlemesi ihtimalini ortaya çıkarmaktadır. Bu noktalarda yapısal iyileştirme yaparak  mukavemeti artırmak için kanal ağızlarındaki keskin kenarlarda pah kırma işlemi yapılmaktadır. Uçak parçalarının üretiminin ve belirli küçük ölçülerde pah kırma işleminin çok hassas olmasından dolayı ufak hatalar bile büyük sorunlara veya performans farklılıklarına yol açmaktadır. Üretimdeki hatalar ve yetersizliklerden ötürü de pah kırma işleminde istenilen ölçü tam yakalanamamakta, hatta tolerans dışına çıkabilmektedir. Bu sebeple tasarlanacak, üretilecek veya tasarımında değişiklik yapılacak her parçanın çok dikkatli bir şekilde testlere tabi tutulması ve uçaklarda kullanılmadan önce, ilgili parçanın görevini doğru bir şekilde yerine getirdiğinden emin olmak gerekmektedir. Bu yüksek lisans tez çalışması kapsamında farklı pah yarıçaplarına sahip kanal ağızlarından tahliye olan havanın kanatçığın firar kenarı yüzeyine olan etkisi bilgisayar programlarıyla simule edilerek ve deneysel olarak araştırılmış ve karşılaştırılmıştır. Çalışmanın sonunda sayısal ve deneysel analizlerin genel olarak aynı sonuçta birleştiği, ancak birebir örtüşmediği görülmüştür. Farklılıkların sebebinin sayısal analizlerin kusursuz geometriler üzerinde, deneysel analizlerin ise üretimdeki hatalar ve yetersizlikler nedeniyle kusurlu modeller üzerinde yapılmış olduğu anlaşılmıştır. Sonuç olarak söz konusu deliklerde pah kırılmasının ve üretimdeki hataların deliklerden çıkan jetin kanatçık firar kenarı yüzeyine temasını olumsuz yönde etkilediği tespit edilmiştir. Due to {{continuous development}} of the aviation and increasing importance of the air transportation, nowadays, aircrafts have {{become one of the}} most widely used means of transportation. Passenger and cargo airlines perform their commercial flights at high altitudes around 9 - 12 km because of the economic reasons. However, since the air temperature decreases down to - 56, 5 °C at these altitudes, it is seen that flying at these altitudes can cause icing on the aircraft control surfaces, wings and early stages of the turbo-jet, turbo-fan or turbo-prop engines. To prevent the icing on the aircraft control surfaces and the wings, some anti-icing chemical liquids are sprayed to related surfaces before every flight. In addition, to prevent icing on the wings for several aircrafts, some alternative systems are available like anti-icing valves.   The icing formed in the engine is seen on the <b>stator</b> <b>vanes</b> <b>of</b> the first stage axial compressor and affects the engine performance in a negative way. To avoid this, holes are drilled on the <b>stator</b> <b>vanes</b> and hot air taken from forward engine stages is released from these holes to prevent icing on the trailing edges <b>of</b> the <b>stator</b> <b>vanes.</b> However, the stress intensity, which accumulates on the sharp edges of the holes,  increases the possibility of crack formation and propogation. In order to strenghten these points as a structural improvement, chamfering of the hole sharp edges is performed. Since the production of aircraft parts and edge chamfering process in certain small radius are very precise, even small errors can lead to big problems and performance differences. Also, the desired chamfer size cannot be reached and even sometimes it can be out of tolerance due to errors and inefficiencies during production. Therefore, parts to be designed, manufactured or modified must be subject to careful tests before installing on the aircraft and it is necessary to make sure that related parts fulfill their function properly. Within this thesis, investigation, computational and experimental simulations were done to see the effect of the air, which is released from the holes that have different chamfer radiuses, on the trailing edge surface <b>of</b> the <b>stator</b> <b>vanes.</b> After that results of computational and experimental analysis were compared. For computational analysis, geometries were prepared according to real <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> models and other experimental setup to have the oppurtunity to compare the results in similar conditions as much as possible. Then, meshing of the whole geometry was generated and analysis were performed with appropriate boundary conditions and solution methods by using commercial CFD programmes. For experimental analysis, experimental setup was made ready, calibrations of the required tools were done, room temperature made constant and setup was run for a determined same duration for every single case.   Computational analysis can be divided into two groups. The first one is the real analysis that considers the actual working conditions of the engine and the second one is the computational analyis of the experimental study based on similarity conditions. So, for  the computational analysis, two pre-determined different actual working conditions of the engine were selected and considering them, thermo-physical properties of the flows were calculated. Afterwards, based on the related references, three similarity paramaters were decided as velocity ratio, mass flux ratio and momentum  ratio and analysis were made for two groups, three different chamfer radiuses, three similarity parameters and two turbulence approach including k-ε and LES. As a result of computational analysis, mass flux ratio was selected as the similarity parameter to calculate flow properties which were used in experimental analysis since it gave the most similar results to the real cases.   For experimental analysis, success criteriaof the anti icing jet was determined as the wet area that anti icing flow contacted the trailing edge surface <b>of</b> the <b>stator</b> <b>vane.</b> To evaluate and make this are visible, at first, trailing edge <b>of</b> the <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> was painted and then paint thinner was atomized and sprayed from the holes drilled on <b>stator</b> <b>vane.</b> Consequently, following results were obtained as a result of both analysis: It is seen in the computational analysis results that the area jet flow contacted the surface <b>of</b> <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> decreases with the increase in the radius of the chamfer. The surface contact area of jet flow is bigger for the <b>stator</b> <b>vanes</b> that have holes with smaller chamfer radius. The chamfer radius does not affect much the surface contact of jet flow at the holes located in the upper part <b>of</b> the <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> due to the twisted aerofoil <b>of</b> <b>stator</b> <b>vane.</b> The effect <b>of</b> the jet velocity differences to the surface contact of jet flow increase with the increase in the chamfer radius and jet velocity is inversely proportional with the surface area jet flow contacted. As a result of experimental analysis, as expected, <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> that has the biggest chamfer radius had the least succesful performance in terms of surface contact area. However, the most succesful performance belongs to <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> that had  the medium sized chamfer radius instead of the smallest chamfer radius. The reasons behind this are the deficiencies in manufactaring of the holes and errors in dimensioning during chamfering process. Computational and  experimental analysis concurred on a final result in general, however it cannot be said that all results agreed one by one. The reasons behind this is that computational analysis were made using ideal <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> geometry with perfect holes, but experimental analysis were made using imperfect <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> geometry that has out of tolerance chamfer radiueses due to the errors and deficiencies during manufacturing process.   In final words, it was detected that chamfering of the hole edges and errors in production affects negatively the <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> contact surface area of jet flow.  To prevent this negative effect and to get the desired anti-icing efficiency, smaller chamfer radius must be preferred, manufacturing quality must be improved and chamfering process must be more precise. If it is desired to expand the research on this subject, <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> surface contact area of jet flow can be investigated  based on the flow properties inside the boundary layer. Additionally,  effect of aerofoil twist on contact surface area of jet flow and effect of the change of anti-icing holes’ coordinates on <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> can be investigated and opitmum hole positions can be detected.

In addition to high rotational speeds and temperatures, they are also subjected to dynamic forces from a non-uniform pressure field in the flow path. Dynamic forces even at a relatively small amplitude can cause failure by fatigue, which leads to fracture of blades and crash of the machine. These adverse conditions, called resonance, should be avoided already in the design stage when a suitable choice <b>of</b> <b>stator</b> <b>vanes</b> and the number of blades can move the critical speed of the blisk beyond the operating speed or at least reduce their influence. In the case of a small jet engine produced by the První brněnská strojírna (PBS) Velká Bíteš, the operating speed is of nearly half of the entire speed range of the machine. This makes the design of a proposed turbine wheel very complicated. A higher harmonic order of aerodynamic excitation is almost always present, its influence was therefore tested experimentally by vibration tests in the test station PBS Velká Bíteš...|$|R

The test bench {{presented in this paper}} was designed to independently excite the wheel sectors with one electromagnetic shaker each blade. Since a wide frequency range (1 - 10 kHz) is usually considered for bladed wheels, custom electromagnetic devices were designed, and then a closedloop control software was also implemented. The global mode shapes of the wheel were then reconstructed through subsequent accelerometer measurements on all sectors to evaluate the harmonic response. The main target of the test rig is the reproduction of any operational condition by experimentally simulating an arbitrary number <b>of</b> <b>stator</b> <b>vanes.</b> In this way the response levels of the differently excited modes are measured and the modal damping is optimally quantified by providing a selective excitation of any number of nodal diameters. Preliminary results showed how the test setup actually allows to excite those modes with a specific number of nodal diameters, however, also exposed some difficulties to avoid small load components with different numbers of nodal diameters...|$|R

The tools are modelled as deformable bodies, as tool deformation is the most important reason for the deviation of the vane dimensions from the required dimensions. 3 D FEM simulations have been carried out of the rolling of a test vane.
