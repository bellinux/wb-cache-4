25|$|Rebecca Caldwell (played by Sarah Wynter) — A child {{psychiatrist}} who met Johnny during his {{investigation of the}} murder of her sister Rachel. Rebecca became Johnny's girlfriend, and at one point in time, found out that Greg <b>Stillson</b> may have been responsible for her sister's murder and will be responsible for the upcoming apocalypse.

She left Johnny, seeking to sort things out for herself.|$|E
25|$|The pipe wrench, or <b>Stillson</b> wrench, is an {{adjustable}} wrench used for turning soft iron {{pipes and fittings}} with a rounded surface. The design of the adjustable jaw allows it to rock in the frame, such that any forward pressure on the handle tends to pull the jaws tighter together. Teeth angled {{in the direction of}} turn dig into the soft pipe. The pipe wrench was invented by Daniel C. <b>Stillson</b> in 1869.|$|E
25|$|Greg <b>Stillson</b> (played by Sean Patrick Flanery) — A mentally {{unstable}} {{politician who}} has taken many illegal steps to secure an election. Upon meeting with Johnny Smith, {{it became clear that}} <b>Stillson</b> would become responsible for an apocalyptic event that Johnny has seen in his visions and is trying to prevent. After the death of Malcolm Janus (see below), Johnny's visions of a Stillson-created apocalypse ceased, but after some further revelations, they returned {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

During her [...] "farewell show" [...] at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne, there were cameos by fellow Australian performers including Liz Stringer and Dallas Frasca who surprised the audience by interpreting their favorite McAvoy songs. During this concert, McAvoy performed a duet version of The Sailor with Wally de Backer (Gotye). This live concert collaboration {{has proven to be}} a fan favorite and has received over 33,000 views on YouTube. The band included Cat Canteri (The <b>Stillsons),</b> Suzanne Kinsella and Megan Bernard.|$|R

25|$|NY242 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY394 {{just north of}} <b>Stillson</b> Pond in Coldspring. NY242 proceeds northeast through Coldspring on a two-lane rural road that crosses from Coldspring {{to the town of}} Napoli. The route winds northeast, intersecting with Jamestown Road, where it turns eastward. At Manley Hill Road, NY242 bends northeast into a junction with County Route10 (Allegany Road). The surroundings along NY242 do not change much as it continues northeast, and after several miles and one large hill, residences become more sporadic. Just south of the intersection of Kyler Hill Road, the route leaves Napoli and crosses into the town of Little Valley.|$|E
25|$|Bruce Lewis (played by John L. Adams) — A {{physiotherapist}} {{who helps}} Johnny regain his strength after his coma. Bruce is an open-minded spiritual junkie {{as a result}} of a religious upbringing by his pastor father. He is Johnny's best friend and frequently his voice of reason, and may very well be the reason for the divergence in this series when compared to the novel or 1983 movie (Johnny never tried to kill Greg <b>Stillson</b> before the election). An episode in season 2 even featured a vision of an alternate reality where instead of being a physical therapist, Bruce was a reverend who never met Johnny after waking up from his coma. And thus, with the absence of his guidance, this version of Johnny became unstable, deranged, and driven mad by his abilities.|$|E

Lisa listens to This American Life, a public radio program voiced by Ira Glass. Also, Ethan and Kurt have a map of Middle Earth on the wall of their apartment.

Sarah {{was pregnant}} when Johnny had his accident, and she ultimately married Walt, who raised J.J. {{as his own}} son. As of the third season, Walt and Sarah have told J.J. that Johnny is his real father, and Johnny has taken on more fatherly duties. In the season six episode [...] "Big Top", Johnny starts to believe that J.J. has inherited his powers, but J.J. appears to be covering up his innate abilities. In the series finale, J.J. has his first actual vision when he sees Armageddon during a scuffle with Greg <b>Stillson.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Born Abhay Charan De in Calcutta, he {{was educated}} at the Scottish Church College in Calcutta. Before {{adopting}} {{the life of}} a pious renunciant (vanaprastha) in 1950, he was married with children and owned a small pharmaceutical business. In 1959 he took a vow of renunciation (sannyasa) and started writing commentaries on Vaishnava scriptures. In his later years, as a travelling Vaishnava monk, he became an influential communicator of Gaudiya Vaishnava theology to India and specifically to the West through his leadership of ISKCON, founded in 1966. As the founder of ISKCON, he [...] "emerged as a major figure of the Western counterculture, initiating thousands of young Americans." [...] He received criticism from anti-cult groups, as well as a favourable welcome from religious scholars such as J. <b>Stillson</b> Judah, Harvey Cox, Larry Shinn and Thomas Hopkins, who praised Bhaktivedanta Swami's translations and defended the group against distorted media images and misinterpretations. In respect to his achievements, religious leaders from other Gaudiya Vaishnava movements have also given him credit.|$|E
2500|$|Boam {{abandoned}} King's parallel story {{structure for}} The Dead Zones screenplay, turning the plot into separate episodes. Boam told writer Tim Lucas in 1983, [...] "King's book {{is longer than}} it needed to be. The novel sprawls and it's episodic. What I did was use that episodic quality, because I saw The Dead Zone as a triptych." [...] His script was revised and condensed four times by Cronenberg, who eliminated large portions of the novel's story, including plot points about Johnny Smith having a brain tumor. Cronenberg, Boam, and Hill had script meetings to revise the screenplay page by page. Boam's [...] "triptych" [...] in the screenplay surrounds three acts: the introduction of Johnny Smith before his car accident and after he awakes from a coma, a story about Smith assisting a sheriff track down the Castle Rock Killer, and finally Johnny deciding to confront the politician <b>Stillson.</b> Boam said that he enjoyed writing the character development for Smith, having him struggle with the responsibility of his psychic abilities, and ultimately give up his life for the greater good. [...] "It was this theme that made me like the book, and I particularly enjoyed discovering it in what was essentially a genre piece, a work of exploitation," [...] he said. In Boam's first draft of the screenplay, Johnny doesn't die at the end, but rather has a vision about the Castle Rock Killer, who is still alive and escaped from prison. Cronenberg insisted that this [...] "trick ending" [...] be revised. Boam submitted the final draft of the screenplay on November 8, 1982.|$|E
