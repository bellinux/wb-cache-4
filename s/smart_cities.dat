5|$|In 1804, Coimbatore was {{established}} {{as the capital}} of the newly formed Coimbatore district and in 1866 it was accorded municipality status with Robert Stanes as its Chairman. The city experienced a textile boom in the early 19th century due to the decline of the cotton industry in Mumbai. Post independence, Coimbatore has seen rapid growth due to industrialisation. Coimbatore was ranked the best emerging city in India by India Today in the 2014 annual Indian city survey. The city was ranked fourth among Indian cities in investment climate by Confederation of Indian Industry and 17th among the top global outsourcing cities by Tholons. Coimbatore has been selected as one of the hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship <b>Smart</b> <b>Cities</b> Mission. Coimbatore was rated as the safest city in India for women according to National Crime Records Bureau report in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In state {{legislative}} assembly elections in May 2016, the AIADMK {{was returned to}} power in Tamil Nadu, albeit with a reduced majority. The party lost eight seats to the opposing DMK in Chennai district and a further eight seats elsewhere; its losses were attributed to its perceived failure to properly address the flood crisis. On 16 June, K. Rosaiah, the governor of Tamil Nadu, announced the state government would soon develop comprehensive flood protection plans for Chennai and its surrounding coastal districts; he said the emphasis would be on providing better roads, storm water drains, solid waste management, sewerage management and street lights. The initiatives would be synergised with the <b>Smart</b> <b>Cities</b> Programme and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation scheme. Funding had also been obtained from the World Bank and from the Asian Development Bank for climate-change impact reduction initiatives, {{as well as for}} the restoration of water bodies and tanks. As of July 2016, however, local citizens' groups said no constructive work had been done to rejuvenate local water bodies and that the effects of a similar north-east monsoon would have an equally destructive impact.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — <b>Smart</b> <b>City</b> is {{a future}} city that heavily {{utilizes}} {{information and communication}} technology and allows the users to use the <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> services anytime, anywhere and with any accessing devices. In our <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> called UTOPIA, which has 3 tiers architecture, such as the <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> infra, the <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> middleware called SOUL and the <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> portal, administrators as well as citizens, can use smart phones, tablet personal computers, and other modern mobile devices to utilize <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> services through the <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> portal. Since big data are usually processed in real-time to provide <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> services, {{it is not easy}} at all to give the mobile cloud and grid web services in a <b>smart</b> <b>city.</b> In this paper, we introduce our mobile cloud and grid web services in a <b>smart</b> <b>city,</b> show some venues and explain the mechanisms of the cloud and grid web service in SOUL and UTOPIA...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an exploratory {{dimension to the}} current <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> discussion by regarding the <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> as a heterotopia space – a space of otherness. By adopting a Foucauldian approach, this paper briefly describes the ‘discursive formation’ of the <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> by analysing its ‘surfaces of emergence’, ‘authorities of delimitation’, and ‘grids of specification’, in order to capture the <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> discourse trajectory. It then focuses on analysing the <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> as a heterotopia space by applying Foucault’s six principles of heterotopias to the data gathered through twenty-seven ethnographic interviews with the <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> experts. In so doing, the paper intends to explore the possible implications for design – and ‘design’ in its widest sense – in the <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> context...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} and critiques {{the concept}} of a <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> from an ontological point of view, focusing on the technological imperative that drives <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> development.

This thesis uses critical Foucauldian discourse analysis as a method, and uses <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> politics in Amsterdam, Barcelona, and New York City as case studies.

25|$|The IoT allows {{objects to}} be sensed or {{controlled}} remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more direct {{integration of the}} physical world into computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit in addition to reduced human intervention.

30|$|Cloud {{computing}} is {{an important}} component of any <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> as it can provide scalable processing power and data storage for different <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> applications [34]. Cloud computing has powerful processing capabilities, large and scalable data storage, and advanced software services that can be utilized to build different support services to provision diverse <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> applications. Cloud computing can be used as the main control and management platform used to execute <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> applications. Different sensors and actuators of <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> applications can be connected to the city’s cloud computing services to collect, process, store the sensors’ data and perform management tasks for different <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> applications. As the collected data from a <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> can also become big data as huge amounts of data are collected throughout the city. Cloud computing can provide the necessary powerful platforms for storing and processing this big data to enhance operations and planning.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{sustainability}} of the <b>Smart</b> <b>City</b> from the acceptability perspective. Assuming {{that there is a}} possibility for end-users to reject some of the <b>Smart</b> <b>City</b> principles and, consequently, to jeopardize its perenniality, we argue that studying how citizens perceive some of the <b>Smart</b> <b>City</b> concepts is a prerequisite for the assessment of the <b>Smart</b> <b>City</b> sustainability scheme. In this paper, we test the acceptability of the <b>Smart</b> <b>City</b> by confronting the theoretical concepts generally mobilized in the literature with the people’s actual perceptions. To this end, a short survey was distributed on the occasion of three <b>Smart</b> <b>City</b> events.

It thus repositions chore concepts of the <b>Smart</b> <b>City</b> in regard of acceptability, and particularly in relation to the associated risks for its sustainability. Peer reviewe...|$|R

25|$|Various current {{movements}} in urban design seek to create sustainable urban environments with long-lasting structures, buildings {{and a great}} liveability for its inhabitants. The most clearly defined form of walkable urbanism {{is known as the}} Charter of New Urbanism. It is an approach for successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve <b>smart</b> <b>cities</b> that support sustainable transport. Residents in compact urban neighbourhoods drive fewer miles and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures compared with those living in sprawling suburbs. The concept of Circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land taken by urban sprawl.|$|E
