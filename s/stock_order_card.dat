50|$|Players {{command a}} variety of units: infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Each unit is {{composed}} of a varying number of plastic figures. During each turn, players alternate playing cards from their hands. There are Order and Special <b>Order</b> <b>cards</b> <b>Order</b> <b>cards</b> allow a player to activate a number of units on a specified section -left flank, center, or right flank. Special <b>Order</b> <b>cards</b> provide specific unique manipulations of game mechanics that are detailed on the card. Attacks are made by rolling a number of dice, depending on the attacking unit and any defensive terrain. Each six-sided die is labeled with each unit symbol; if the rolled symbol matches the target's unit type, a single figure is removed. A flag roll on the die forces the unit to retreat one square.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Detecting {{changes in}} stock prices {{is a well}} known problem in finance with {{important}} implications for monitoring and business intelligence. Forewarning of changes in stock price, {{can be made by}} the early detection of changes in the distributions of <b>stock</b> <b>order</b> numbers. In this paper, we address the change detection problem for streams of <b>stock</b> <b>order</b> numbers and propose a novel incremental detection algorithm. Our algorithm gains high accuracy and low delay by employing a natural Poisson distribution assumption about the nature of <b>stock</b> <b>order</b> streams. We establish that our algorithm is highly scalable and has linear complexity. We also experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness for detecting change points, via experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets. I...|$|R

40|$|Obesity in {{children}} is a nationwide problem. Physical activity {{is one way to}} help children stay fit and prevent obesity. Unfortunately, access to technology involving sedentary behavior is easier than ever. Fortunately, for this generation of students {{there is a way to}} combine physical activity and technology through exergaming. In order to encourage students to participate in exergaming, the students should be able to play games they prefer. The purpose of this study was to apply a paired choice preference assessment, rank <b>order</b> <b>card</b> sort, and social validity surveys to determine the preference order of six exergames for six elementary students and measure heart rates as the children played the six exergames. The results of this study show that children had different preferences as evident by the rank <b>order</b> <b>card</b> sort, social validity survey, and paired choice preference assessment. The pre-rank <b>order</b> <b>card</b> sort was significantly correlated with the paired choice assessment.

40|$|With a {{decreasing}} {{market for}} trucks and low volumes of sales, {{service and maintenance}} has come to constitute {{an important source of}} income for truck manufacturers. A further tendency in the business is that the general interest in service quality, for instance within sales warranties and maintenance, has increased considerable. Hence, it has become extremely important to focus on handling and improving service quality. Nowadays, when the customer perceives little technical difference between competing offers, manufacturing companies need to create differential advantages through added value. For Scania Deutschland GmbH, this implies focusing on the customers, as well as improving the section of service and maintenance. An important factor within service and maintenance is to secure supply of spare-parts to the retailers. It has further been shown essential to maintain a stable inventory management at the central warehouse {{as well as at the}} retailers. Hence, the order routines must function smoothly. This thesis work is a product of the endeavour for lowering costs and improving the order process, with focus on the order placement between the retailers and the central warehouse. The aim for Scania Deutschland GmbH is to increase the orders placed on a daily basis, i. e daily <b>stock</b> <b>orders,</b> implying an increased inventory planning at the retailers. Consequently, the purpose of this thesis is to identify factors that restrain an increased level of daily <b>stock</b> <b>orders.</b> I have explored and described the order process at Scania Deutschland GmbH, and as a result identified factors that restrain the level of daily <b>stock</b> <b>orders.</b> The findings show that an increased level of daily orders would lower the transportation costs for Scania Deutschland GmbH. It can also be concluded that placing daily <b>stock</b> <b>orders</b> involve lower costs for the retailers than for other types of orders. A strict inventory control including control of problem spare-parts, together with a higher safety stock, will secure the supply of spare-parts. Finally, it was found that increased feedback and improved information flow would have a positive impact on the usage of daily orders. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|NoThis paper {{presents}} a stochastic automaton approach to <b>stock</b> <b>ordering</b> for retailers of time-limited goods, {{in the modern}} supply chain network. The rationale applied is that by ordering in small quantities frequently, overstocking will be reduced, capital liquidity improved and wastage limited. A consequence for the complete supply chain is that such an approach could substantially minimise the reactive bullwhip effect, leading to more efficient utilisation, production and agility throughout the chain. Such agility and flexibility can only be achieved by full integration of stock inventory monitoring technologies (such as RFID) with enterprise integration systems (such as ERP) connected to suppliers, mediated by the internet. We undertake a comparative simulation study of <b>stock</b> <b>ordering</b> using a stochastic automaton and a naive traditional approach. This shows that stochastic ordering, prompted by a stochastic automaton, exhibits characteristic properties that are a prerequisite for reducing the bullwhip effect, thus enabling agile inventory management...|$|R

Commonality is much stronger for individual, rather than institutional (proprietary), order imbalances. Institutional (proprietary) investors favor large capitalization stocks, and co-movement in institutional (proprietary) order imbalances is stronger for these <b>stocks.</b> <b>Order</b> imbalance Commonality Individual Institutional Proprietary investors...|$|R
