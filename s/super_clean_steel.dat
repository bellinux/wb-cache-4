Refining processes that applied for low alloy and alloyed steel production include degassing via vacuum or ladle and ladle furnace units. This technique could help in producing homogeneous steel with low gas content and minimum internal defects. In certain grades of steel for tools and penetration and impact resistance uses, non-metallic inclusions (NMI) and sulphur content are the key factors for the steel performance and applications. ESR, Electro-salg refining (or remelting), is the technique that can efficiently produce <b>clean</b> <b>steel</b> with minimum content of NMI and sulphur due to the special nature and mechanism of this technique. In this study, the effect of initial chemical composition of steel and slag properties on the efficiency of ESR process in removal of NMI and sulphur from steel are evaluated.

The efficiency of ESR in modifying and enhancing NMI shape, size and counts as well as removal of sulphur in different steel grades was evaluated at different slag composition and physical properties.

This study {{is focused on the}} link between the characteristics of non-metallic inclusions in the steel and the machinability of the given steel grades. For this purpose, inclusion characteristics (such as composition, number, size, morphology etc.) in steel samples were determined by common two-dimensional (2 D) observations of inclusions on polished metal surface of samples as well as by three-dimensional (3 D) investigations of inclusions after electrolytic extraction from steel samples. The inclusion characteristics were investigated in the three types of 20 NiCrMo carburizing steel grades: Steel A ‑ reference steel (410 ppm S) having a common level of mechanical properties and machinability, Steel B ‑ steel grade (having 340 ppm S) with an improved machinability due to the Ca-treatment and modification of MnS inclusions and <b>Steel</b> C ‑ <b>clean</b> <b>steel</b> grade (40 ppm S) having a small amount of inclusions and a higher fatigue strength. It was found that the number of inclusions in Steel B is smaller than that in Steel A and that the inclusion composition is different.

However, the significant decrease of the number of inclusions in the <b>clean</b> <b>steel</b> (Steel C) resulted in a lower machinability in comparison to the reference steel grade.
