40|$|Brush seals are compliant, contact seals {{that have}} long-life, low-leakage {{characteristics}} desirable {{for use in}} rocket engine turbopumps. 50. 8 -mm (2. 0 inch) diameter brush seals with a nominal initial radial interference of 0. 127 -mm (0. 005 inch) were tested in liquid nitrogen at shaft speeds up to 35, 000 rpm and differential pressure loads up to 1. 21 MPa (175 psi) per brush. The measured leakage rate of a single brush was 2 - 3 times less than that measured for a 12 -tooth, 0. 127 -mm (0. 005 inch) radial clearance labyrinth seal used as a baseline. Stage effects were studied and {{it was found that}} two brush seals with a large separation distance leaked less than two brushes tightly packed together. The maximum measured groove depth on the Inconel 718 rotor was 25. 4 (mu) m (0. 001 inch) after 4. 31 hours of shaft rotation. The Haynes- 25 bristles wore approximately 25. 4 - 76. 2 (mu) m (0. 001 - 0. 003 inch) under the same conditions. Three <b>seal</b> <b>runner</b> coatings, chromium carbide, Teflon impregnated chromium, and zirconium oxide, were tested in liquid hydrogen at 35, 000 and 65, 000 rpm with separate 50. 8 mm diameter brush seals made of Haynes- 25 bristles and having a nominal initial radial interference of 129 rpm. Two bare Inconel- 718 rotors were also tested as a baseline. The test results revealed significant differences between the wear characteristics of the uncoated and coated seal runners. At both speeds the brush seal with the bare Inconel- 718 <b>seal</b> <b>runner</b> exhibited significant bristle wear with excessive material transferring to the runner surface. In contrast, the coated seal runners inhibited the transfer and deposit of bristle material. The chromium carbide coating showed only small quantities of bristle material transferring to its surface. The Teflon impregnated chromium coating also inhibited material transfer and provided some lubrication. This coating, however, is self-sacrificing. The Teflon remained present on the low speed runner, but it was completely removed from the high speed brush seal, which was tested considerably longer. The tests of the Teflon coating revealed the importance of using a lubricating and low friction coating for brush seals to reduce bristle and <b>seal</b> <b>runner</b> wear. The zirconium oxide coating exhibited the greatest amount of coating wear, while the brushes incurred only slight wear. Further testing of ceramics is recommended before making a final judgement on the viability of ceramic coatings for brush seals because of the contrast between the results reported by Carlile and the results presented herein. Strictly based on the results presented hereinabove, the chromium carbide and Teflon impregnated chromium coatings were considered preferable to the uncoated Inconel- 718 and zirconium oxide coatings because of their good wear resistance and characteristics to inhibit bristle material wear and transfer to the <b>seal</b> <b>runner...</b>|$|E

50|$|Former {{player and}} {{assistant}} manager Barry Wilson was appointed as manager on 28 January 2014 and announced {{his intention to}} have a squad of north-based players. Barry Wilson resigned as manager on 17 November 2014 {{and was replaced by}} Jim Weir 10 days later. On 30 April 2016, they <b>sealed</b> the <b>runners</b> up spot in Scottish League Two and entered the promotion Play-offs. However, they lost 5-1 on aggregate to Clyde and remained in League Two.|$|R
50|$|Troy Tulowitzki and Matt Holliday hit {{consecutive}} one-out {{home runs}} {{in the first inning}} off Phillies rookie starter Kyle Kendrick, but his team responded with Jimmy Rollins' lead-off home run {{in the bottom of the}} inning off of Rockies starter Franklin Morales, coming off his own rookie season. Rollins' two-run triple next inning gave the Phillies a 3-2 lead. That lead then vanished two innings later when Kaz Matsui hit a two-out grand slam off Phillies reliever Kyle Lohse. Jos√© Mesa walked two to lead off the sixth, then Yorvit Torrealba's two-run double put the Rockies up 8-3. After Josh Fogg bunted out, Clay Condrey relieved Mesa and allowed an RBI triple to Matsui. Tulowitzki struck out before Holliday's RBI single made it 10-3 Rockies. Ryan Howard hit a leadoff home run in the bottom of the inning off of Jeremy Affeldt. In the sevehth, Shane Victorino singled with one out off of Ryan Speier, advanced to third on a stole base attempt and Torrealba's throwing error, and scored on Rollins's groundout. Philadelphia loaded the bases in the eighth inning, but Manny Corpas earned a four-out save in stranding all three <b>runners,</b> <b>sealing</b> the Rockies' 10-5 victory. Matsui was a single short of hitting for the cycle.|$|R
40|$|Program {{objectives}} were to determine three advanced configurations of helium buffer seals {{capable of providing}} improved performance in a space shuttle main engine (SSME), high-pressure liquid oxygen (LOX) turbopump environment, and to provide NASA with the analytical tools to determine performance {{of a variety of}} seal configurations. The three seal designs included solid-ring fluid-film seals often referred to as floating ring seals, back-to-back fluid-film face seals, and a circumferential sectored seal that incorporated inherent clearance adjustment capabilities. Of the three seals designed, the sectored seal is favored because the self-adjusting clearance features accommodate the variations in clearance that will occur because of thermal and centrifugal distortions without compromising performance. Moreover, leakage can be contained well below the maximum target values; minimizing leakage is important on the SSME since helium is provided by an external tank. A reduction in tank size translates to an increase in payload that can be carried on board the shuttle. The computer codes supplied under this program included a code for analyzing a variety of gas-lubricated, floating ring, and sector seals; a code for analyzing gas-lubricated face seals; a code for optimizing and analyzing gas-lubricated spiral-groove face seals; and a code for determining fluid-film face <b>seal</b> response to <b>runner</b> excitations in as many as five degrees of freedom. These codes proved invaluable for optimizing designs and estimating final performance of the seals described...|$|R
