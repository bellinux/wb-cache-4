5|$|The lowest {{elevations}} of Pinkham Notch are {{occupied by}} a northern hardwood forest. This forest type is primarily deciduous and consists mostly of sugar maple, American beech, and yellow birch. There is also a proliferation of understory and forest floor plants; common examples include wild <b>sarsaparilla,</b> painted trillium, hobblebush, and Indian cucumber-root.|$|E
5|$|Nescopeck Mountain is one {{of several}} {{mountains}} in Columbia County to contain undisturbed oak/mixed hardwood forests. This forest is also an Appalachian Oak Forest. Specific tree species on the ridge in Columbia County include red oak, chestnut oak, scarlet oak, black birch, American chestnut, pitch pine, red maple, and serviceberry. Other plants on the ridge include black huckleberry, lowbush blueberry, mountain laurel, sheep's laurel, bracken fern, wild <b>sarsaparilla,</b> and Virginia creeper.|$|E

25|$|The term {{root crops}} refers to any edible {{underground}} plant structure, but many root crops are actually stems, such as potato tubers. Edible roots include cassava, sweet potato, beet, carrot, rutabaga, turnip, parsnip, radish, yam and horseradish. Spices obtained from roots include sassafras, angelica, <b>sarsaparilla</b> and licorice.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} the above factors is an {{extensive}} understory of vegetation in the aspen forest. Common shrubs and herbs are: saskatoon, red-osier dogwood, raspberry, wild rose, currants and bracted honeysuckle, wild <b>sarsaparilla,</b> hairy lungwort, asters, and peavine. Twinflower, strawberries, bunchberries, horsetails and wintergreen form an attractive grown cover.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} Lempira's revolt, the {{establishment}} of the bishopric (first at Trujillo, then at Comayagua after Pedraza's death), and the decline in fighting among rival Spanish factions all contributed to expanded settlement and increased economic activity in the 1540s. A variety of agricultural activities was developed, including cattle ranching and, for a time, the harvesting of large quantities of <b>sarsaparilla</b> root. But the key economic activity of 16th-century Honduras was mining gold and silver.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not long}} before {{flavoring}} was combined with carbonated water. The earliest reference to carbonated ginger beer is in a Practical Treatise on Brewing. published in 1809. The drinking of either natural or artificial mineral water was considered at the time to be a healthy practice, and was promoted by advocates of temperance. Pharmacists selling mineral waters began to add herbs and chemicals to unflavored mineral water. They used birch bark (see birch beer), dandelion, <b>sarsaparilla,</b> fruit extracts, and other substances. Flavorings were also added to improve the taste.|$|E
25|$|Lowell {{continued}} {{to be in the}} forefront of new industrial technology. In 1828, Paul Moody developed an early belt-driven power transfer system to supersede the unreliable gearwork that was utilized at the time. In 1830, Patrick Tracy Jackson commissioned work on the Boston and Lowell Railroad, one of the Oldest railroads in North America. It opened five years became independent in 1845, patent medicine factories like Hood's <b>Sarsaparilla</b> Laboratory later, making the Middlesex Canal obsolete. Soon, lines up the Merrimack to Nashua, downriver to Lawrence, and inland to Groton Junction, today known as Ayer (renamed after Lowell patent medicine tycoon Dr. James Cook Ayer), were constructed.|$|E
25|$|Favorite food plants include {{native and}} {{introduced}} species from {{all sorts of}} dicot families, such as Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Bignoniaceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, Myrtaceae or Solanaceae. Magnoliidae fruit, for example of Duguetia furfuracea (Annonaceae) or avocados (Persea americana, Lauraceae) can be seasonally important. They do not usually eat cereal grains, or monocots in general. However, the leaves of particular grass species like Brachiaria brizantha can be eaten in large quantities, and Liliaceae (e.g. the <b>sarsaparilla</b> Smilax brasiliensis) have also been recorded as foodplants. Even tough and spiny vegetable matter like tubers or thistles is eaten with relish. Like many birds which feed on tough plant matter, the greater rhea swallows pebbles which help grind down the food for easy digestion. It is much attracted to sparkling objects and sometimes accidentally swallows metallic or glossy objects.|$|E

In just ten days, Almeida made 16 captures and while he continued at the rate of the four-month campaign, those waters gave huge profits. Among the prizes were the brig San Antonio de Padua, captured on January 28, 1817 with a cargo of sugar, snuff, and silk scarves (burned); the schooner New Catalina; the brig San Antonio Abad (February 19), of Veracruz and in ballast, that was burned; the brig Paz on February 24 on a trip from Sisal to Havana; the brig San Jose from Campeche to Havana with cargo of brandy and wine; and the schooners Mary and Squirrel (with load of <b>sarsaparilla</b> and $2,000, burned).|$|E
25|$|One of the town's most {{well-known}} shops, the shoe store Tommy Ball's, closed in May 2008 after going into administration. The town's oldest store, Mercer & Sons, also closed after {{a decline in}} sales blamed on the credit crunch. It opened in 1840 and was originally an ironmonger but the public store converted to selling toys, household goods and hardware. However, in January 2009 {{the directors of the}} company announced that the shop would close following a 30-day statutory consultation, unless they change their mind or a buyer is found. The markets continue to offer a wide range of local produce—Lancashire cheeses, tripe, Bowland beef and lamb can all be found. Walsh's <b>Sarsaparilla</b> stall decided not to move into the new market development. The market moved into the Mall shopping centre in 2011, and now opens 6 days a week (closed on bank holidays).|$|E
25|$|As a varietal wine, Merlot {{can make}} soft, velvety wines with plum flavors. While Merlot wines tend to mature faster than Cabernet Sauvignon, some {{examples}} {{can continue to}} develop in the bottle for decades. There are three main styles of Merlot — a soft, fruity, smooth wine with very little tannins, a fruity wine with more tannic structure and, finally, a brawny, highly tannic style made in the profile of Cabernet Sauvignon. Some of the fruit notes commonly associated with Merlot include cassis, black and red cherries, blackberry, blueberry, boysenberry, mulberry, ollalieberry and plum. Vegetable and earthy notes include black and green olives, cola nut, bell pepper, fennel, humus, leather, mushrooms, rhubarb and tobacco. Floral and herbal notes commonly associated with Merlot include green and black tea, eucalyptus, laurel, mint, oregano, pine, rosemary, sage, <b>sarsaparilla</b> and thyme. When Merlot has spent significant time in oak, the wine may show notes of caramel, chocolate, coconut, coffee bean, dill weed, mocha, molasses, smoke, vanilla and walnut.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, Russell Marker, a {{professor}} of organic chemistry at Pennsylvania State University, developed a method of synthesizing progesterone from plant steroid sapogenins, initially using sarsapogenin from <b>sarsaparilla,</b> which proved too expensive. After three years of extensive botanical research, he discovered a much better starting material, the saponin from inedible Mexican yams (Dioscorea mexicana and Dioscorea composita) found in the rain forests of Veracruz near Orizaba. The saponin could be converted in the lab to its aglycone moiety diosgenin. Unable to interest his research sponsor Parke-Davis in the commercial potential of synthesizing progesterone from Mexican yams, Marker left Penn State and in 1944 co-founded Syntex with two partners in Mexico City. When he left Syntex a year later the trade of the barbasco yam had started and {{the period of the}} heyday of the Mexican steroid industry had been started. Syntex broke the monopoly of European pharmaceutical companies on steroid hormones, reducing the price of progesterone almost 200-fold over the next eight years.|$|E

2500|$|With , the North is the country's largest region, {{covering}} 45.3% of {{the national}} territory. The region's principal biome is the humid tropical forest, {{also known as the}} rain forest, home to some of the planet's richest biological diversity. The North has served as a source of forest products ranging from [...] "backlands drugs" [...] (such as <b>sarsaparilla,</b> cocoa, cinnamon, and turtle butter) in the colonial period to rubber and Brazil nuts in more recent times. In the mid-twentieth century, nonforest products from mining, farming, and livestock-raising became more important, and in the 1980s the lumber industry boomed. In 1990, 6.6% of the region's territory was considered altered by anthropic (man-made) action, with state levels varying from 0.9% in Amapá to 14.0% in Rondônia.|$|E
2500|$|Barrow {{was also}} the home of soft-drink company Marsh's, which {{produced}} a distinctive <b>sarsaparilla</b> flavoured fizzy drink known as Sass. Marsh's was purchased by Purity Soft Drinks of Birmingham in 1993, and the company stopped producing Sass in 1999. Remaining bottles have subsequently sold for high prices as a collector's item. A new product, labelled [...] "Barrow Sass", was launched in 2014 {{in a bid to}} replicate traditional Sass. The coasts around Barrow have rich cockle beds from which cockles have traditionally been gathered, although numbers have been low following intensive gathering during the early 2000s, in the run up to the 2004 Morecambe Bay cockling disaster. One of England's few remaining Oyster farms can also be found located in the Biggar area of Walney. Traditional Cumberland sausages are less associated with Barrow itself than the rest of Cumbria, but are readily available from the surrounding rural area. Cumbria has produced a number of famed dishes and is home to countless Michelin Guide restaurants, one of which is located in Dalton.|$|E
2500|$|The park bears three {{distinct}} upland forest types. [...] Pine forest grows on level areas, ridgetops, and lakeshores.

[...] The shrub layer varies inversely with the density of the canopy, and comprises beaked hazel, juneberry, blueberry, and bush honeysuckle. [...] Aspen–birch forest occurs as an early-succession cover type on the moraines, the last areas of the park to be logged. [...] Its canopy is dominated by trembling aspen and paper birch, with balsam fir and red and white pine. Beaked hazel dominates the dense shrub layer, while ground cover is characterized by bracken fern and forbs such as largeleaf aster and <b>sarsaparilla.</b> [...] Lastly the shallow upland till soils support aspen–birch–fir forest. [...] Trembling aspen, paper birch, and balsam fir are of course dominant, with some black and white spruce, red and white pine, and white cedar. [...] Beaked hazel and mountain maple comprise the modest shrub layer, while the ground cover is more litter and grasses than forbs.|$|E
