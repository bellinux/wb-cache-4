5|$|A {{number of}} folk tales about the Sumatran rhino were {{collected}} by colonial naturalists and hunters from the mid-19th century to early 20th century. In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that {{the best time to}} hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, it was said that the rhino's horn was hollow and {{could be used as a}} sort of hose for breathing air and <b>squirting</b> water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it under the ground. In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating in a stream, it would turn around and eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement.|$|E
5|$|Doc {{meets with}} Beynon, who {{attempts}} a double-cross before Carol shoots and kills him. Doc realizes that Carol {{had sex with}} Beynon to secure his release from prison. He angrily gathers up the money and, after a bitter quarrel, the couple flees for the border at El Paso. A bloodied Rudy forces rural veterinarian Harold and his young wife Fran to treat his injuries, then kidnaps them to pursue Doc and Carol. Beynon's brother Cully and his thugs also pursue the McCoys. At a train station, a con man swaps locker keys with Carol and steals their bag of money. Doc follows him onto a train and forcefully takes it back. The injured con man and a train passengera boy whom Doc had rebuked for <b>squirting</b> him with a water gunare taken to the police station, where they identify Doc's mug shot.|$|E
5|$|Freema Agyeman, {{who played}} Martha Jones in Doctor Who and Torchwood, {{introduced}} the episode, which was shown {{on a large}} screen above the stage and smaller screens {{around the edge of}} the Dress Circle in the Royal Albert Hall. As the Doctor addressed them, the Royal Albert Hall audience shouted back responses. Manuscript paper fell to the stage as the Doctor was seen to feed his sheet music to the orchestra. When the Graske sneaked through the portal, he appeared in the audience carrying the Doctor's water pistol and <b>squirting</b> members of the audience. A cellist had to defend himself from an attack by the Graske who promptly exited as, on screen, the Doctor pulled him back to the TARDIS. The Graske in the audience was Jimmy Vee in costume and prosthetics.|$|E

5|$|Redbacks usually prey on insects, but {{can capture}} larger animals that become {{entangled}} in the web, including trapdoor spiders, small lizards, and even on rare occasion snakes. One web was recorded as containing a dead mouse. The woodlouse (Porcellio scaber) is a particularly common food item. Developing spiderlings need size-appropriate prey, and laboratory studies {{show that they are}} willing to consume common fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor), muscoid flies and early nymphs of cockroaches. Food scraps and lighting attract insect prey to areas of human activity, which brings the redbacks. Once alerted to a creature becoming ensnared in a trap line, the redback advances to around a leg's length from its target, touching it and <b>squirting</b> a liquid glutinous silk over it to immobilise it. It then bites its victim repeatedly on the head, body and leg joints and wraps it in sticky and dry silk. Unlike other spiders, it does not rotate its prey while wrapping in silk, but like other spiders, it then injects a venom that liquefies its victim's innards. Once it has trussed the prey, the redback takes it to its retreat and begins sucking out the liquefied insides, generally 5 to 20 minutes after first attacking it. Redback spiders do not usually drink, except when starved.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, <b>squirting</b> the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E

25|$|Disgusting {{and terrifying}} {{parasitic}} alien species are widespread in science fiction, as {{for instance in}} Ridley Scott's 1979 film Alien. In one scene of that film, an alien bursts out of the chest of a dead man, with blood <b>squirting</b> out under high pressure assisted by explosive squibs. Animal viscera were used to reinforce the shock effect. The scene was filmed in a single take, and the startled reaction of the actors was genuine.|$|E

25|$|When {{it opened}} in 1994 (replacing the former Grimms Hollow children's area), Land of the Dragons was the main kiddie area at Busch Gardens. It is home to Dumpherey the Dragon, the area's mascot. Other major notes taken to Land of the Dragons include its dragon-themed 3-story tree house, a wet play area with waterfalls, <b>squirting</b> geysers, and a serpent inhabiting the area, and a dragon-egg Ferris wheel. There are also smaller play zones, slides, smaller wet play areas and (formerly) a gift shop called Dragon Digs.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of termite soldiers secrete a rubberlike and sticky chemical concoction that serves to entangle enemies, called a Fontanellar gun, {{and it is}} usually coupled with specialized mandibles. In nasute species of termites (contained within the subfamily Nasutitermitinae), the mandibles have receded. This makes way for an elongated, syringic nasus capable of <b>squirting</b> liquid glue. When this substance is released from the frontal gland reservoir and dries, it becomes sticky and is capable of immobilizing attackers. It is highly effective against other arthropods, including spiders, ants, and centipedes.|$|E
25|$|Many {{suppliers}} of insects for reptiles offer live bugs and worms. Monitor lizards are typically fed live insects {{and may not}} eat pre-killed ones. Amphibians typically require live insects—wild-caught, home-grown, or bought at a pet store—although some like axolotls can be fed chunks of meat. It's generally hard to convert reptiles and amphibians that eat insects to pre-killed prey, though some pet owners can feed dead insects by moving or dangling them. Bearded dragons can be fed dead crickets by hiding them in other food, dangling them with tongs, <b>squirting</b> them with water, or vibrating a bowl.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Squirt</b> boating {{incorporates}} {{the use of}} low-volume boats to perform special moves in whitewater features. <b>Squirt</b> boating predates, and was critical to the foundation of, playboating. <b>Squirt</b> boats are often fairly long and flat, with low volume throughout the design. Because <b>squirt</b> boats are custom built to the paddlers weight, inseam, and personal preference, they are constructed with composite materials instead of plastic. Many <b>squirt</b> moves are intended to submerge {{all or part of}} the craft and paddler, such as the [...] "mystery move," [...] in which both the boat and the paddler submerge completely into the river's flow for several seconds and up to half a minute.|$|R

25|$|In 1999, Moss {{had another}} {{impressive}} season, catching 80 passes for 1,413 yards and 11 touchdowns. He {{went on to}} record five receptions for 127 {{yards and a touchdown}} in the Vikings 27–10 NFC wildcard playoff win over the Dallas Cowboys. Minnesota lost in the divisional round to the St. Louis Rams 49–37, despite Moss catching nine passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns. Moss was fined $40,000, which was later reduced to $25,000, during that game due to <b>squirting</b> an NFL referee with a water bottle. There was a stipulation {{that he would have to}} pay the difference in addition to any other fine if he had another run-in with the league.|$|E
25|$|Australia thus gave India {{a target}} of 199 in 23 overs. The Indian openers however, started {{extremely}} badly, {{with both of them}} getting out in successive balls to Nathan Bracken, giving him a chance of bagging a hat-trick on his test debut. The match came alive after that and VVS Laxman the next batsman, avoided the hattrick by <b>squirting</b> the ball through gully. Thereafter, India had no problems absolutely, as Rahul Dravid and Laxman took the score to respectability with Dravid dominating the partnership, scoring 43 only off 47 balls, while Laxman charmed his way on to a breezy 24. Amazingly, for a match in which ten hours of play was lost, this match kept the spectators interested till the end.|$|E
25|$|While {{previous}} thought {{held that}} compounds {{were added to}} the blood from glands in the ocular sinus cavity, current research has shown that the chemical compounds that make up the defense are already in the circulating blood. It is possible that their diet of large quantities of venomous Harvester Ants could be a factor; however, the origin and structure of the chemicals responsible are still unknown. The blood-squirting mechanism increases survival after contact with canine predators; therefore, it is probable that, while unorthodox, the trait could have provided an evolutionary advantage. Ocular autohemorrhaging has also been documented in other lizards, which suggests blood-squirting could have evolved from a less extreme defense in the ancestral branch of the genus. Recent phylogenic research supports this claim, so it appears as though the species incapable of <b>squirting</b> blood have lost the adaptation for reasons yet unstudied.|$|E

25|$|Gudas was {{thrust into}} a top-4 role on defense for the season, with Eric Brewer being {{moved to a}} more {{manageable}} 3rd pair role. Gudas continued to play his physical game that he had become known for in his first full NHL season. His rough and tumble in-your-face game also landed Gudas in trouble at a few points during the season. The biggest incident involved Panthers forward Scottie Upshall <b>squirting</b> Gudas {{with a bottle of}} water from after he had fallen in front of the Panthers bench. Gudas would retaliate by smashing his stick on the Panthers in frustration. He would be ejected from the game for his actions, though the Lightning would still go onto to win the game despite being down a defensemen {{for the remainder of the}} game. Gudas also received a match penalty against the Dallas Stars on 5 March 2014. Though it was announced by Lightning General Manager Steve Yzerman that there would not be any additional discipline from the league. Gudas finished his first full NHL season by playing three games in the Stanley Cup playoffs for the Tampa Bay Lightning in a 4 sweep by the Montreal Canadiens.|$|E
25|$|Broadcast 11 January 1995, {{the first}} episode looks at how plants are able to move. The bramble is an {{aggressive}} example: it advances forcefully {{from side to side}} and, once settled on its course, there is little that can stand in its way. An altogether faster species is the birdcage plant, which inhabits Californian sand dunes. When its location becomes exposed, it shifts at great speed to another one with the assistance of wind — and it is this that allows many forms of vegetation to distribute their seeds. While not a plant, the spores of fungi are also spread in a similar fashion. One of the most successful (and intricate) flowers to use the wind is the dandelion, whose seeds travel with the aid of 'parachutes'. They are needed to travel miles away from their parents, who are too densely packed to allow any new arrivals. Trees have the advantage of height to send their seeds further, and the cottonwood is shown as a specialist in this regard. The humidity of the tropical rainforest creates transportation problems, and the liana-species Alsomitra macrocarpa is one plant whose seeds are aerodynamic 'gliders'. Some, such as those of the sycamore, take the form of 'helicopters', while others, such as the <b>squirting</b> cucumber release their seeds by 'exploding'. Water is also a widely used method of propulsion. The tropical sea bean Entada gigas has one of the biggest fruits of all plants and is dispersed by water streams. However, most plants use living couriers, whether they be dogs, humans and other primates, ants or birds, etc., and to that end, they use colour and smell to signify when they are ripe for picking.|$|E
