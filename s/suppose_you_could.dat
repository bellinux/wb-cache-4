25|$|Income {{taxation}} has {{the worst}} effect on {{division of labor}} {{in the form of}} barter. Suppose that the person doing job B is actually interested in having job A done for him. Now <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> amazingly do job A four times over, selling half your work on the market for cash just to pay your tax bill. The other half of the work you do for somebody who does job B twice over but he has to sell off half to pay his tax bill. You're left with one unit of job B, but only if you were 400% as productive doing job A! In this case of 50% tax on barter income, anything less than 400% productivity will cause the division of labor to fail.|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E
500|$|In 1973, FDR's son Elliott {{published}} An Untold Story: The Roosevelts of Hyde Park, {{in which}} he recalled seeing LeHand in his father's lap and alleged that she [...] "shared a familiar life in all its aspects with father". His eldest brother Jimmy disagreed, arguing that FDR's illness had made sexual function too {{difficult for him to}} have a physical affair. [...] "I <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say they came to love one another", he wrote, [...] "but it was not a physical love." [...] Kathryn Smith, the author of the only biography of LeHand, could come to no conclusion, but wrote, [...] "As far as evidence goes, {{there is not a single}} written account of anyone seeing them in a compromising position, despite the hundreds of Secret Service agents, staff members, political cronies, family members and friends who traipsed through FDR's bedrooms—which he used as an auxiliary office—during their twenty-one years together." [...] She quotes LeHand's great-niece, Jane Scarbrough, who said, [...] "We have no reason to believe they did , but we don't know." ...|$|E

500|$|In summer 2014, Allardyce signed midfielder Cheikhou Kouyaté, left-back Aaron Cresswell, {{attacker}} Enner Valencia, right-back (on {{loan from}} Arsenal) Carl Jenkinson, striker Diafra Sakho, defensive midfielder Alex Song (on loan from Barcelona), midfielder Morgan Amalfitano, and forward Mauro Zárate. In October 2014, pundits like BBC's Robbie Savage were commenting about the team's [...] "more attractive and attacking playing style" [...] or [...] "the statistics [...] show {{the progress that}} West Ham have {{made in the last}} few months." [...] Allardyce was awarded the Premier League Manager of the Month for October 2014 after three wins for West Ham out of four games played that month. Allardyce left West Ham on 24 May 2015, {{the final day of the}} season, after his contract was not renewed. Allardyce stated that [...] "I didn't want to stay. I <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say it was mutual if they didn't want me to stay either". His West Ham side had finished 12th in the 2014–15 season, one place higher than in the 2013–14 season.|$|E

2500|$|In {{summarizing}} the biographical works on Gandhi, Blema S. Steinberg concluded she was decidedly non-ideological. Only 7.4% (24) {{of the total}} 330 biographical extractions posit ideology {{as a reason for}} her policy choices. Steinberg noted Gandhi's association with socialism was superficial; only having a general and traditional commitment to the ideology, by way of her political and family ties. Gandhi personally had a fuzzy concept of socialism. In one of the early interviews she had given as Prime Minister, Gandhi had ruminated: [...] "I <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> call me a socialist, but you have understand what we mean by that term...we used the word [...] because it came closest to {{what we wanted to do}} here – which is to eradicate poverty. You can call it socialism; but if by using that word we arouse controversy, I don't see why we should use it. I don't believe in words at all." [...] Regardless of the debate over her ideology or lack of thereof, Gandhi remains a left-wing icon. She has been described by Hindustan Times columnist, Pankaj Vohra as [...] "arguably the greatest mass leader of the last century." [...] Her campaign slogan, Garibi Hatao (Eng: Remove Poverty), has become the iconic motto of the Indian National Congress. To the rural and urban poor, untouchables, minorities and women in India, Gandhi was [...] "Indira Amma or Mother Indira." ...|$|E
