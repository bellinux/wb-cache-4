40|$|Abstract Background Many conserved <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> {{have been}} {{identified}} within conserved elements in the human genome, but {{only a small fraction}} of them are known to be functional RNAs. The evolutionary variations of these conserved <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> in human populations and their biological functions have not been fully studied. Results We searched for polymorphisms within conserved <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> and identified a number of SNPs within these elements even though they are highly conserved among species. The density of SNPs in conserved <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> is about 65 % of that of their flanking, non-conserved, sequences. Classification of sites as stems or as loops/bulges revealed that the density of SNPs in stems is about 62 % of that found in loops/bulges. Analysis of derived allele frequency data indicates that sites in stems are under stronger evolutionary constraint than sites in loops/bulges. Intergenic conserved <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> tend to associate with transcription factor-encoding genes with genetic distance being the measure of regulator-gene associations. A substantial fraction of intergenic conserved <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> overlap characterized binding sites for multiple transcription factors. Conclusion Strong purifying selection implies that <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> are probably important carriers of biological functions for conserved sequences. The overlap between intergenic conserved <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> and transcription factor binding sites further suggests that intergenic conserved <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> have essential roles in directing gene expression in transcriptional regulation networks. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{similarity}} {{comparison of}} RNA <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> {{is important in}} studying the functions of RNAs. In recent years, most existing tools represent the <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> by tree-based presentation and calculate the similarity by tree alignment distance. Different to previous approaches, we propose a new method based on maximum clique detection algorithm to extract the maximum common structural elements in compared RNA <b>secondary</b> <b>structures.</b> A new graph-based similarity measurement and maximum common subgraph detection procedures for comparing purely RNA <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> is introduced. Given two RNA <b>secondary</b> <b>structures,</b> the proposed algorithm consists of a process to determine the score of the structural similarity, followed by comparing vertices labelling, the labelled edges and the exact degree of each vertex. The proposed algorithm also consists of a process to extract the common structural elements between compared <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> based on a proposed maximum clique detection of the problem. This graph-based model also can work with NC-IUB code to perform the pattern-based searching. Therefore, {{it can be used}} to identify functional RNA motifs from database or to extract common substructures between complex RNA <b>secondary</b> <b>structures.</b> We have proved the performance of this proposed algorithm by experimental results. It provides a new idea of comparing RNA <b>secondary</b> <b>structures.</b> This tool is helpful to those who are interested in structural bioinformatics.

5|$|A {{common and}} popular {{structural}} alignment method is the DALI, or distance alignment matrix method, which breaks the input structures into hexapeptide fragments and calculates a distance matrix by evaluating the contact patterns between successive fragments. <b>Secondary</b> <b>structure</b> features that involve residues that are contiguous in sequence {{appear on the}} matrix's main diagonal; other diagonals in the matrix reflect spatial contacts between residues that are not near {{each other in the}} sequence. When these diagonals are parallel to the main diagonal, the features they represent are parallel; when they are perpendicular, their features are antiparallel. This representation is memory-intensive because the features in the square matrix are symmetrical (and thus redundant) about the main diagonal.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{nanostructures}} must be rationally {{designed so}} that individual nucleic acid strands will assemble into the desired structures. This process usually begins with specification of a desired target structure or function. Then, the overall <b>secondary</b> <b>structure</b> of the target complex is determined, specifying the arrangement of nucleic acid strands within the structure, and which portions of those strands should be bound to each other. The last step is the primary structure design, which is the specification of the actual base sequences of each nucleic acid strand.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes are not rigid, static structures; {{instead they}} have complex {{internal}} dynamic motions – that is, {{movements of parts}} of the enzyme's structure such as individual amino acid residues, groups of residues forming a protein loop or unit of <b>secondary</b> <b>structure,</b> or even an entire protein domain. These motions {{give rise to a}} conformational ensemble of slightly different structures that interconvert with one another at equilibrium. Different states within this ensemble may be associated with different aspects of an enzyme's function. For example, different conformations of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase are associated with the substrate binding, catalysis, cofactor release, and product release steps of the catalytic cycle.|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis {{discusses}} graph grammars as a tool to generate RNA <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> from sequences. <b>Secondary</b> <b>structures</b> are viewed as graphs of relations and an experimental eNCE graph grammar is hand-coded based on stereochemical constraints. Then, given a sequence, all <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> represented by graphs of relations that are parsed by the grammar are returned, with a free energy measure that indicates the structure's stability. The second part of this thesis discusses searching for motifs in RNA <b>secondary</b> <b>structures.</b> A script language is defined to encode <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> as graphs of relations. These graphs allow for rapid identification of all occurences of a given pattern, also encoded as a graph of relations. Then, analysing the results obtained by running the search engine on all known RNA <b>secondary</b> <b>structures,</b> motifs might be identified...|$|R

The paper presents a technique for the classification of protein <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> based on protein "signal-plotting" and the use of the Fourier technique for digital signal processing.

5|$|In many bacteria, both mRNAs and non-coding RNAs can be polyadenylated. This poly(A) tail {{promotes}} degradation by the degradosome, {{which contains}} two RNA-degrading enzymes: polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase E. Polynucleotide phosphorylase binds to the 3' end of RNAs and the 3' extension {{provided by the}} poly(A) tail allows it to bind to the RNAs whose <b>secondary</b> <b>structure</b> would otherwise block the 3' end. Successive rounds of polyadenylation and degradation of the 3' end by polynucleotide phosphorylase allows the degradosome to overcome these secondary structures. The poly(A) tail can also recruit RNases that cut the RNA in two. These bacterial poly(A) tails are about 30 nucleotides long.|$|E
5|$|Serpins {{are also}} {{expressed}} by viruses {{as a way}} to evade the host's immune defense. In particular, serpins expressed by pox viruses, including cow pox (vaccinia) and rabbit pox (myxoma), are of interest because of their potential use as novel therapeutics for immune and inflammatory disorders as well as transplant therapy. Serp1 suppresses the TLR-mediated innate immune response and allows indefinite cardiac allograft survival in rats. Crma and Serp2 are both cross-class inhibitors and target both serine (granzyme B; albeit weakly) and cysteine proteases (caspase1 and caspase8). In comparison to their mammalian counterparts, viral serpins contain significant deletions of elements of <b>secondary</b> <b>structure.</b> Specifically, crmA lacks the D-helix as well as significant portions of the A- and E-helices.|$|E
30|$|The results above {{show that}} it is still a {{challenge}} to predict the topology of RNA <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> correctly and the identical topology consistency of predicted <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> with native ones is only about 38 % on average. Therefore, the RNA tertiary structure prediction based on pure predicted <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> is greatly limited. Even the similar topology consistency of the predicted <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> with the native ones can reach 60 %– 70 %, but in this case the predicted <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> usually introduce different or additional bulge and internal loops that may also decrease the accuracy of the RNA tertiary structure prediction based on them. Therefore, from a topological point of view, the success rate of RNA tertiary structure prediction based on pure predicted <b>secondary</b> <b>structures</b> can reach more than 38 % or 60 %– 70 % if wrong internal and bulge loops are ignored.|$|R

The Tower domain has {{an important role in the}} tumour suppressor function of BRCA2, and is essential for appropriate binding of BRCA2 to DNA.|$|E
5|$|After any of {{the above}} {{approaches}} are used to design the <b>secondary</b> <b>structure</b> of a target complex, an actual sequence of nucleotides that will form into the desired structure must be devised. Nucleic acid design is the process of assigning a specific nucleic acid base sequence to each of a structure's constituent strands so that they will associate into a desired conformation. Most methods have the goal of designing sequences so that the target structure has the lowest energy, and is thus the most thermodynamically favorable, while incorrectly assembled structures have higher energies and are thus disfavored. This is done either through simple, faster heuristic methods such as sequence symmetry minimization, or by using a full nearest-neighbor thermodynamic model, which is more accurate but slower and more computationally intensive. Geometric models are used to examine tertiary structure of the nanostructures and to ensure that the complexes are not overly strained.|$|E
5|$|Protein {{structures}} have to {{be represented}} in some coordinate-independent space to make them comparable. This is typically achieved by constructing a sequence-to-sequence matrix or series of matrices that encompass comparative metrics: rather than absolute distances relative to a fixed coordinate space. An intuitive representation is the distance matrix, which is a two-dimensional matrix containing all pairwise distances between some subset of the atoms in each structure (such as the alpha carbons). The matrix increases in dimensionality {{as the number of}} structures to be simultaneously aligned increases. Reducing the protein to a coarse metric such as <b>secondary</b> <b>structure</b> elements (SSEs) or structural fragments can also produce sensible alignments, despite the loss of information from discarding distances, as noise is also discarded. Choosing a representation to facilitate computation is critical to developing an efficient alignment mechanism.|$|E

5|$|The {{combinatorial}} extension (CE) {{method is}} similar to DALI in that it too breaks each structure in the query set {{into a series of}} fragments that it then attempts to reassemble into a complete alignment. A series of pairwise combinations of fragments called aligned fragment pairs, or AFPs, are used to define a similarity matrix through which an optimal path is generated to identify the final alignment. Only AFPs that meet given criteria for local similarity are included in the matrix as a means of reducing the necessary search space and thereby increasing efficiency. A number of similarity metrics are possible; the original definition of the CE method included only structural superpositions and inter-residue distances but has since been expanded to include local environmental properties such as <b>secondary</b> <b>structure,</b> solvent exposure, hydrogen-bonding patterns, and dihedral angles.|$|E
5|$|When two proteins' {{distance}} matrices {{share the}} same or similar features in approximately the same positions, they {{can be said to}} have similar folds with similar-length loops connecting their <b>secondary</b> <b>structure</b> elements. DALI's actual alignment process requires a similarity search after the two proteins' distance matrices are built; this is normally conducted via a series of overlapping submatrices of size 6x6. Submatrix matches are then reassembled into a final alignment via a standard score-maximization algorithm— the original version of DALI used a Monte Carlo simulation to maximize a structural similarity score that {{is a function of the}} distances between putative corresponding atoms. In particular, more distant atoms within corresponding features are exponentially downweighted to reduce the effects of noise introduced by loop mobility, helix torsions, and other minor structural variations. Because DALI relies on an all-to-all distance matrix, it can account for the possibility that structurally aligned features might appear in different orders within the two sequences being compared.|$|E
5|$|Because protein {{structures}} {{are composed of}} amino acids whose side chains are linked by a common protein backbone, {{a number of different}} possible subsets of the atoms that make up a protein macromolecule can be used in producing a structural alignment and calculating the corresponding RMSD values. When aligning structures with very different sequences, the side chain atoms generally are not taken into account because their identities differ between many aligned residues. For this reason it is common for structural alignment methods to use by default only the backbone atoms included in the peptide bond. For simplicity and efficiency, often only the alpha carbon positions are considered, since the peptide bond has a minimally variant planar conformation. Only when the structures to be aligned are highly similar or even identical is it meaningful to align side-chain atom positions, in which case the RMSD reflects not only the conformation of the protein backbone but also the rotameric states of the side chains. Other comparison criteria that reduce noise and bolster positive matches include <b>secondary</b> <b>structure</b> assignment, native contact maps or residue interaction patterns, measures of side chain packing, and measures of hydrogen bond retention.|$|E
