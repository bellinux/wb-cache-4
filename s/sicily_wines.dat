5000|$|Alcamo {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} centres in <b>Sicily</b> for <b>wine</b> production, especially Bianco Alcamo D.O.C., made from vineyards with espailer or [...] "tendone" [...] structures and using white common or bright catarratto vines, eventually associated with damaschino, grecanico and trebbiano.|$|R
25|$|In Italy, Syrah {{is grown}} in Tuscany (i.e. Cortona DOC), Lazio (Pontine Agro), and Apulia (Syrah Tarantino IGT). Also a DOC Sirah Piedmont exists. The region though {{which has made}} {{one of the best}} uses of Syrah, by {{blending}} it with Nero d'Avola grapes, is <b>Sicily.</b> The <b>wines</b> thus obtained are mellow with spicy accents and are in great demand on the international market.|$|R
50|$|The drink {{most often}} {{served with the}} main meal in <b>Sicily</b> is <b>wine.</b> The soil and climate in Sicily are ideal for growing grapes, mainly due to Mount Etna, and a wine-making {{tradition}} on the island has existed since the Greeks first set up colonies on the island. Today, all Sicilian provinces produce wine and Sicilian wine produced by modern methods has established itself on the European wine market.|$|R
50|$|Frappato di Vittoria or Frappato {{is a red}} Italian {{wine grape}} variety planted {{primarily}} in Sicily. As a varietal, Frappato produces light bodied wines with a distinct grapey aroma. It is most commonly seen {{as a component of}} <b>Sicily's</b> only DOCG <b>wine,</b> Cerasuolo di Vittoria, which consists of 30-50% Frappato and 50-70% Nero d'Avola.|$|R
5000|$|Nero d'Avola ( [...] ; [...] "Black of Avola" [...] in Italian) is [...] "the most {{important}} red wine grape in Sicily" [...] {{and is one}} of Italy's {{most important}} indigenous varieties. It is named after Avola in the far south of <b>Sicily</b> and its <b>wines</b> are compared to New World Shirazes, with sweet tannins and plum or peppery flavours. It also contributes to Marsala Rubino blends.|$|R
25|$|Sicily's sunny, dry climate, scenery, cuisine, {{history and}} {{architecture}} attract many tourists from mainland Italy and abroad. The tourist season {{peaks in the}} summer months, although people visit the island all year round. Mount Etna, the beaches, the archaeological sites, and major cities such as Palermo, Catania, Syracuse and Ragusa are the favourite tourist destinations, but the old town of Taormina and the neighbouring seaside resort of Giardini Naxos draw visitors {{from all over the}} world, as do the Aeolian Islands, Erice, Castellammare del Golfo, Cefalù, Agrigento, the Pelagie Islands and Capo d'Orlando. The last features some of the best-preserved temples of the ancient Greek period. Many Mediterranean cruise ships stop in <b>Sicily,</b> and many <b>wine</b> tourists also visit the island.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} defend varietal aromas from {{oxidation}} before alcoholic fermentation, two musts were prepared from white grapes pre-cooled and added with ascorbic acid and solid CO 2 (trial ACO 2) or SO 2 (trial BSO 2). Experiments were performed with grapes {{of a white}} grape variety indigenous to western <b>Sicily,</b> the <b>wines</b> from which, obtained by vinification of musts protected from oxidation and poor in copper, as previously proven, have aroma descriptors ascribed to passion fruit and grapefruit skin. The smaller content in flavanols in the ACO 2 trial, demonstrated {{that the use of}} solid CO 2, instead of SO 2, reduced the extraction of such polyphenols from grape solids. The higher content in hydroxycinnamoyl tartaric acids of the wine from ACO 2 trial with respect to BSO 2 was ascribed to the minor grape polyphenol-oxidase activity induced by the loss of oxygen stripped by CO 2 in ACO 2 or to the combination of caftaric acid quinone to the SO 2 in BSO 2. Although the grapes were very ripe (alcohol in wines ~ 14. 5 % vol), wines made with musts prepared by the two techniques were characterised by aroma descriptors like passion fruit and grapefruit skin not detected in wines prepared from musts not protected from enzymatic oxidations...|$|R
50|$|Chicken marsala is an Italian-American dish {{made from}} chicken cutlets, mushrooms, and Marsala wine. It is a {{variation}} of traditional Italian scaloppina dishes, {{of which there are}} many varieties throughout Italy. The dish dates to the 19th century, when it most likely originated with English families who lived in western <b>Sicily,</b> where Marsala <b>wine</b> is produced. The chicken is coated in flour, briefly sautéed, and then removed from the pan, which is then used to make a Marsala reduction sauce. The sauce is made by reducing the wine to nearly the consistency of a syrup while adding onions or shallots, as well as mushrooms, herbs and possibly other ingredients. The sauce is then poured over the chicken, which has been kept in a warming oven, and served immediately.|$|R
5000|$|Martino's {{text was}} {{included}} in a 1475 book by Bartolomeo Platina printed in Venice entitled De honesta voluptate et valetudine ("On Honest Pleasure and Good Health"). Platina puts Martino's [...] "Libro" [...] in regional context, writing about perch from Lake Maggiore, sardines from Lake Garda, grayling from Adda, hens from Padua, olives from Bologna and Piceno, turbot from Ravenna, rudd from Lake Trasimeno, carrots from Viterbo, bass from the Tiber, roviglioni and shad from Lake Albano, snails from Rieti, figs from Tuscolo, grapes from Narni, oil from Cassino, oranges from Naples and eels from Campania.

40|$|Inspired by a deep {{passion for}} wine, an Italian heritage, {{and a desire}} for a land {{somewhat}} wilder than his home in southern France, Robert V. Camuto set out to explore <b>Sicily’s</b> emerging <b>wine</b> scene. What he discovered during {{more than a year}} of traveling the region, however, was far more than a fascinating wine frontier. Chronicling his journey through Palermo to Marsala, and across the rugged interior of Sicily to the heights of Mount Etna, Camuto captures the personalities and flavors and the traditions and natural riches that have made Italy’s largest and oldest wine region the world traveler’s newest discovery. In the island’s vastly different wines he finds an expression of humanity and nature—and the space where the two merge into something more. Here, amid the wild landscapes, lavish markets, dramatic religious rituals, deliciously contrasting flavors, and astonishing natural warmth of its people, Camuto portrays Sicily at a shining moment in history. He takes readers into the anti-Mafia movement growing in the former mob vineyards around infamous Corleone; tells the stories of some of the island’s most prominent landowning families; and introduces us to film and music celebrities and other foreigners drawn to Sicily’s vineyards. His book takes wine as a powerful metaphor for the independent identity of this mythic land, which has thrown off its legacies of violence, corruption, and poverty to emerge, finally free, with its great soul intact...|$|R
25|$|Sicily is {{the third}} largest wine {{producer}} in Italy (the world's largest wine producer) after Veneto and Emilia Romagna. The region is known mainly for fortified Marsala wines. In recent decades the wine industry has improved, new winemakers are experimenting with less-known native varietals, and Sicilian wines have become better known. The best known local varietal is Nero d'Avola, named for a small town not far from Syracuse; the best wines made with these grapes come from Noto, a famous old city close to Avola. Other important native varietals are Nerello Mascalese {{used to make the}} Etna Rosso DOC wine, Frappato that is a component of the Cerasuolo di Vittoria DOCG wine, Moscato di Pantelleria (also known as Zibibbo) used to make different Pantelleria wines, Malvasia di Lipari used for the Malvasia di Lipari DOC wine and Catarratto mostly used to make the white wine Alcamo DOC. Furthermore, in <b>Sicily</b> high quality <b>wines</b> are also produced using non-native varietals like Syrah, Chardonnay and Merlot.|$|R
40|$|Sicilian {{territory}} vocation to {{the production}} of wines is a prerequisite needed to ensure a large variety of high quality products, very appreciated by national and international markets.

40|$|Sicilian {{territory}} vocation to {{the production}} of wines is a prerequisite needed to ensure a large variety of high quality products. Thanks to native cultivar and to non-native, with good adaptability, Sicilian wine firms diversified production, very appreciated by national and international markets, and expanded the supply of sparkling <b>wines.</b> Indeed, <b>Sicily</b> produces sparkling <b>wines</b> since the past century and now there are 21 Sicilian wineries that produce up to 33 different high quality sparkling wines with typical attributes of the territory and many denomination of origin (DOC). In 2008, Italy saw a significant drop in purchases for Champagne wine, which can definitely be seen as a great opportunity for Sicilian producers of sparkling wine to successfully enter in this market segment. Currently, Sicilian sparkling wines are sold in the local market; however, customer penetration is still low {{due to a lack of}} communication and advertising. This paper aims to investigate, through an experimental survey, consumer preferences on taste of Sicilian sparkling wines. We applied a Simple Correspondence Analysis (SCA) to data collected by a questionnaire, given to a sample of consumers participants to a blind tasting, in order to know, on the basis of their opinion on taste, the structure of dependence between types of sparkling wines tasted by consumers and their lever of satisfaction. So we were able to obtain information on some key factors to increase sales for this particular product...|$|R
