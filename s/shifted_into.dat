5|$|Erinys– The {{daughter}} of Thanatos. After {{the destruction of}} Atlantis, Erinys searched for Kratos, killing various Spartans as a warning for Kratos to stop his quest to find Deimos. Erinys eventually found Kratos in the Mounts of Aroania, and after a land battle, an aerial battle ensued as Erinys shape <b>shifted</b> <b>into</b> an enormous bird before being killed by Kratos, after which, Kratos took her power, the Scourge of Erinys. The character was overdub voiced by Jennifer Hale and Erin Torpey in Ghost of Sparta.|$|E
5|$|Models for a {{continuous}} formation throughout {{the age of}} the Solar System illustrate that at weak resonances within the Kuiper belt (such as 5:7 or 8:1), or at the boundaries of stronger resonances, objects can develop weak orbital instabilities over millions of years. The 4:7 resonance in particular has large instability. KBOs can also be <b>shifted</b> <b>into</b> unstable orbits by close passage of massive objects, or through collisions. Over time, the scattered disc would gradually form from these isolated events.|$|E
40|$|Good {{communication}} in English {{produced by the}} students {{is one of the}} goals of language learning. The students are required to have good pronunciation. Nevertheless, the teacher seldom explains pronunciation in details which makes it as obstacles for the students to produce good pronunciation in English. Mispronunciation that produced by the students will make the listeners get wrong idea about their statement. In this study, the writer attempted to find out the kinds of vowel sound shifts and the causes of the vowel sound shifts produced by the eighth grade students at SMP Darul Qur-an Singosari. In conducting the study, the writer used descriptive research with 32 students of eighth grade at SMP Darul Qur-an Singosari chosen randomly as the research subjects. The instruments used by the writer to collect the data were performance assessment and interview. The findings of this study revealed that the students shifted 19 sounds from 20 vowel sounds. The vowel sound of /ɒ/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ʊ/. The vowel sound of /ə/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ʌ/, /e/, and /ɒ/. The vowel sound of /ʌ/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ɒ/. The vowel sound of /ɜ:/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ɪ/, /i:/, and /e/. The vowel sound of /aʊ/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ɒ/ and /ʌ/. The vowel sound of /i:/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /e/. The vowel sound of /aɪ/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ə/, /ɪ/, /e/, and /eɪ/. The vowel sound of /Ã¦/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /aɪ/, /eɪ/, and /e/. The vowel sound of /u:/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /əʊ/, /Ã¦/, /ʊə/, /aʊ/, /ʊ/, and /e/. The vowel sound of /eə/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /e/ and /ʌ/. The vowel sound of /ɪ/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ʌ/, /ʊ/ and /aɪ/. The vowel sound of /əʊ/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ɒ/ and /ʊ/. The vowel sound of /eɪ/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ə/, /ʌ/, /e/, and /ɒ/. The vowel sound of /ɪə/ shifts into/e/, /ɪ/, and /ə/. The vowel sound of /ɔ:/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ɒ/, /aʊ/, /ʊ/ and /eɪ/. The vowel sound of /e/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ʌ/. The vowel sound of /ʊ/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ɒ/ and /ʌ/. The vowel sound of /ɑ:/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /e/ and /ə/. The vowel sound of /ʊə/ <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> /ɒ/. It was influenced by native language, age, exposure, innate phonetic ability, and motivation and concern or good pronunciation. To sum up, pronunciation is an important feature when the learners are speaking. A single word that shifts will make different meaning...|$|R

5|$|Solis had the {{opportunity}} to run for the California State Assembly when, after California's 1991 redistricting, the incumbent Dave Elder in Solis's 57th State Assembly district was <b>shifted</b> <b>into</b> another district, while her new representative retired. In the June 1992 Democratic primary to fill the open seat, Solis's opponents had the endorsement of powerful State Assemblyman Richard Polanco and the former incumbent. Solis had the support of Molina and U.S. Representative Barbara Boxer, in an effort that focused on door-to-door campaigning and featured Solis's mother making burritos for campaign volunteers. Solis came out on top of a three-way Democratic race, receiving 49percent of the vote and besting her nearest competitor, future Assemblyman Ed Chavez, who received 31percent. In the general election, Solis garnered 61percent of the vote against Republican Gary Woods' 34percent, and gained election to the Assembly. She was one of seven Latinos who won election to the Assembly {{in the wake of the}} redistricting and became collectively known as Los Siete. Solis was among the most liberal of this ideologically diverse group.|$|E

50|$|In {{standard}} mass-production automobiles today, {{the gear}} lever appears similar to manual shifts, {{except that the}} gear stick only moves forward and backward to <b>shift</b> <b>into</b> higher and lower gears, instead of the traditional H-pattern. The Bugatti Veyron uses this approach for its seven-speed transmission. In Formula One, the system is adapted to fit onto the steering wheel {{in the form of}} two paddles; depressing the right paddle <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> a higher gear, while depressing the left paddle <b>shifts</b> <b>into</b> a lower one. Numerous road cars have inherited the same mechanism.|$|R

50|$|Conversely, {{in order}} to shift down, engine RPM must be {{increased}} while the gearbox is in neutral and the clutch is engaged. This requires the driver to slow the vehicle sufficiently, <b>shift</b> <b>into</b> neutral, apply throttle to bring the RPM up to a suitable speed, and finally <b>shift</b> <b>into</b> gear. This operation can {{be very difficult to}} master, as it requires the driver to gauge the speed of the vehicle and throttle to the intended gear accurately; vehicle weight and road gradient are important factors as they influence the vehicle's acceleration or deceleration during the shift. Double clutching is when the clutch pedal is depressed while shifting to neutral to match engine speed to the intended gear and vehicle speed, and again depressed for <b>shifting</b> <b>into</b> gear.|$|R

25|$|On some models, {{cornering}} lamps provide white steady-intensity light for lateral illumination {{in the direction}} of an intended turn or lane change. They are generally actuated in conjunction with the turn signals, and they may be wired to also illuminate when the vehicle is <b>shifted</b> <b>into</b> reverse gear,. Some modern vehicles activate the cornering lamp on one or the other side when the steering wheel input reaches a predetermined angle in that direction, regardless of whether a turn signal has been activated.|$|E

Since the 20th-century realignment of political parties in the South following passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, which provided federal oversight and enforcement to protect voting, African-American residents here have consistently supported Democratic party candidates.

25|$|Transmissions {{normally}} involve two shift registers of some given word size, such {{as eight}} bits, {{one in the}} master {{and one in the}} slave; they are connected in a virtual ring topology. Data is usually shifted out with the most-significant bit first, while shifting a new least-significant bit into the same register. At the same time, Data from the counterpart is <b>shifted</b> <b>into</b> the least-significant bit register. After the register bits have been shifted out and in, the master and slave have exchanged register values. If more data needs to be exchanged, the shift registers are reloaded and the process repeats. Transmission may continue for any number of clock cycles. When complete, the master stops toggling the clock signal, and typically deselects the slave.|$|E
