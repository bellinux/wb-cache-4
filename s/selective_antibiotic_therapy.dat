40|$|The TEM- 1 and SHV- 1 beta-lactamases are {{important}} contributors to resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in gram-negative bacteria. These enzymes share 68 % {{amino acid sequence}} identity and their atomic structures are nearly superimposable. Extended-spectrum cephalosporins were introduced to avoid the action of these beta-lactamases. The widespread use of antibiotics {{has led to the}} evolution of variant TEM and SHV enzymes that can hydrolyze extended-spectrum antibiotics. Despite being highly similar in structure, the TEM and SHV enzymes have evolved differently in response to the <b>selective</b> pressure of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy.</b> Examples of this are at residues Arg 164 and Asp 179. Among TEM variants, substitutions are found only at position 164, while among SHV variants, substitutions are found only at position 179.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{widespread}} avian pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum to invade cultured human epithelial cells (HeLa- 229) and chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) was investigated by using the gentamicin invasion assay and a double immunofluorescence microscopic technique for accurate localization of cell-associated mycoplasmas. The presence of intracellular mycoplasmas in both cell lines was clearly demonstrated, with organisms entering the eukaryotic cells within 20 min. Internalized mycoplasmas {{have the ability to}} leave the cell, but also to survive within the intracellular space over a 48 -h period. Frequencies of invasion were shown to differ between the two cell lines, but were also considerably dependent on the mycoplasma input population. Of the prototype strain R, a low-passage population in artificial medium, Rlow, was capable of active cell invasion, while a high-passage population, Rhigh, showed adherence to but nearly no uptake into HeLa- 229 and CEF. By passaging Rlow and Rhigh multiple times through HeLa- 229 cells, the invasion frequency was signif-icantly increased.

Overall, 25 surgical specimens (15 adenoids, 10 tonsils) were examined from the upper respiratory tract, from 15 paediatric patients (mean age 6 years). All patients were affected by recurrent and/or chronic adenoiditis and adenotonsillitis unresponsive to selective antibiotic and anti-inflammatory therapy. Tissues were cultured using conventional methods and subjected to scanning electron microscopy for detection of biofilm. Haemophilus influenzae strains, were cultured on 96 -sterile well polystyrene microtitre plates (CELLSTAR-greiner bio-one) and stained with 1 % crystal violet to quantify biofilm production. Bacterial cocci attached to the tissue surface and organized in colonies, with a morphology consistent with bacterial coccoid biofilms, were observed in all adenoid (15 / 15) and in 6 / 10 tonsil samples. Haemophilus influenzae isolates from 12 / 25 (48 %) of our tissue samples scored a percent transmittance (%Tbloc) > 50, displaying a high capacity to form biofilms (level 4). In conclusion identification of bacterial biofilms in chronic and/or recurrent paediatric upper airway inflammatory processes and the capacity to produce biofilm in vitro, demonstrated by Haemophilus influenzae (the most frequently identified bacteria in our samples), could be related to the aetiopathogenic role of biofilms in chronic inflammatory mucosal reactions and to the resistance of these infections to <b>selective</b> <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Procalcitonin (PCT) is {{a marker}} for {{bacterial}} infection {{that can be}} used as a diagnostic tool to help distinguish viral from bacterial lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). LRTI is a leading cause of illness in pediatrics worldwide. Most LRTIs in pediatrics are due to viral causes, yet conservative clinical guidelines advise empiric <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy</b> because there is no reliable method to determine the etiology of the illness. With the increasing threat of antibiotic resistance, efforts are underway to decrease the use of <b>antibiotics.</b> PCT-guided <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy</b> has shown a reduction in the use of antibiotics for adult LRTI. Can PCT-guided antibiotic treatment of LRTIs in a pediatric population reduce the <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy</b> duration rate or prescription rate with comparable outcomes to current therapy guidelines? Method: An exhaustive search was conducted using Medline-OVID, CINAHL, and Web of Science using the keywords: procalcitonin, antibiotic, pediatrics, and lower respiratory tract infection. A search on the NIH clinical trials site revealed that there are no trials currently registered relating to the use of PCT-guided <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy</b> in pediatrics with lower respiratory tract infections. GRADE was used to assess the quality of relevant articles. Results: Included in this systematic review were two studies that met inclusion criteria. A randomized, multi-center clinical trial with 337 participants demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the duration of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy,</b> but an increase in the antibiotic prescription rate overall when applying PCT-guided <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy.</b> A randomized, single-center clinical trial with 310 participants demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the duration of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy</b> and <b>antibiotic</b> prescription rate when PCT-guided <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy</b> was applied.

40|$|One rabbit {{pathogenic}} Escherichia coli strain, {{belonging to}} serogroup 0103, harbors a self-transferable 117 -kb plasmid (pREC- 1) encoding resistance to several antibiotics. The role of this R plasmid in the colonization of {{the digestive tract}} in specific-pathogen-free (E. coli 0103 -free) rabbits was studied. Five-week-old rabbits were inoculated with the wild-type strain, with its variant cured of the plasmid, with an E. coli K- 12 strain, or with an untypeable E. coli strain from a healthy rabbit. No symptoms and no mortality were observed in animals inoculated with strains without the plasmid pREC- 1, but 87. 5 % of the rabbits infected by the wild strain died, generally with bloody diarrhea, between days 5 and 15 postinfection. The weight gain of animals was strongly reduced. Transfer of the plasmid to the cured strain or to nonvirulent strains led these strains to induce the same pathology but with a lower mortality. Colonization of the gut by the 0103 strain and symptoms of bloody diarrhea are thus related {{to the presence of}} the pREC- 1 plasmid.

Knowledge {{of the risk}} factors associated with S. maltophilia pneumonia may better guide the selection of empiric <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy.</b> Potential risk factors for S. maltophilia pneumonia were retrospectively analyzed for critically ill trauma patients with late-onset gram-negative pneu-monia. The effects of S. maltophilia infection and inadequate empiric <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy</b> on patient outcomes were also assessed. By multivariate analysis, S. maltophilia pneumonia {{was found to be}} associated with cefepime exposure and tracheostomy in patients with a single pneumonia episode and with higher Injury Severity Score and pulmonary contusion in patients with multiple pneumonia episodes. S. maltophilia pneumonia was associated with increased patient morbidity; only inadequate empiric <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy</b> was associated with a higher mortality rate. In critically ill trauma patients with late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia and these risk factors, empiric <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy</b> should include agents active against S. maltophilia. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is becoming a frequently seen pathogen in intensive care units (ICUs), particularly among respiratory tract isolates [1 â€“ 5]. In addition to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomona...|$|R
40|$|Whether the {{presence}} of Candida spp. in lower respiratory tract (LRT) secretions is a marker of underlying disease, intensive care unit (ICU) treatment and <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy</b> or contributes to poor clinical outcome is unclear. We investigated healthy controls, patients with proposed risk factors for Candida growth in LRT (<b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy,</b> ICU treatment with and without <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy),</b> ICU patients with pneumonia and <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy</b> and candidemic patients (for comparison of truly invasive and colonizing Candida spp.). Fungal patterns were determined by conventional culture based microbiology combined with molecular approaches (next generation sequencing, multilocus sequence typing) for description of fungal and concommitant bacterial microbiota in LRT, and host and fungal biomarkes were investigated. Admission to and treatment on ICUs shifted LRT fungal microbiota to Candida spp. dominated fungal profiles but <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy</b> did not. Compared to controls, Candida was part of fungal microbiota in LRT of ICU patients without pneumonia with and without <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy</b> (63 % and 50 % of total fungal genera) and of ICU patients with pneumonia with <b>antibiotic</b> <b>therapy</b> (73 %) (p< 0. 05). No case of invasive candidiasis originating from Candida in the LRT was detected. There was no common bacterial microbiota profile associated or dissociated with Candida spp. in LRT. Colonizing and invasive Candida strains (from candidemic patients) did not match to certain clades withdrawing {{the presence}} of a particular pathogenic and invasive clade. The presence of Candida spp. in the LRT rather reflected rapidly occurring LRT dysbiosis driven by ICU related factors than was associated with invasive candidiasis...|$|R
