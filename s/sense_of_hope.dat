5|$|Watts' {{performances}} in the championships saw him recruited by the Melbourne Football Club with the first overall selection in the 2008 AFL draft at seventeen years of age, a year younger than most of his fellow draftees. The hype surrounding Watts {{in his first season}} was profound until he made his debut in the Queen's Birthday clash against Collingwood in the 2009 season. The management of his debut has led to long-term criticism of the club because he was played despite being unready for senior football. Instead, Watts was used as a promotional tool to create a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> for long-suffering fans. Criticism has followed Watts closely throughout his career due to the expectations that were placed on him being the number one draft pick and many believing he was not living up to his potential.|$|E

25|$|Hoping to find {{a leader}} that could put the team back on track, New York hired Larry Brown to coach the team. Brown, who idolized the team during his childhood, was well {{regarded}} for his coaching abilities and his arrival brought a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> to the franchise. Hoping to find the next Patrick Ewing, the Knicks drafted center Channing Frye and signed centers Jerome James and Eddy Curry, the former prior to the season and the latter during the season. Curry, who reportedly had a worrying heart condition, refused to take a controversial DNA test, and fell out of favor with John Paxson, Chicago's general manager. The Bulls signed-and-traded him to the Knicks along with Antonio Davis for Tim Thomas, Michael Sweetney, the Knicks 2006 first round pick, {{and the right to}} swap first-round picks with the Knicks in 2007, as well as 2007 and 2009 second-round picks. Isiah Thomas did not lottery-protect the picks, and the Knicks forfeited the second pick in the 2006 draft, and the ninth in the 2007 draft. With a bloated payroll, the Knicks stumbled to the second worst record in the NBA that season, at 23–59. The season concluded with the firing and $18.5 million buy-out of head coach Larry Brown after one season.|$|E

500|$|The film {{switches}} the infertility from male {{to female}} but never explains its cause: environmental destruction and divine punishment are considered. This unanswered question (and {{others in the}} film) {{have been attributed to}} Cuarón's dislike for expository film: [...] "There's a kind of cinema I detest, which is a cinema that is about exposition and explanations... It's become now what I call a medium for lazy readers... Cinema is a hostage of narrative. [...] And I'm very good at narrative as a hostage of cinema." [...] Cuarón's disdain for back-story and exposition led him to use the concept of female infertility as a [...] "metaphor for the fading sense of hope". [...] The [...] "almost mythical" [...] Human Project is turned into a [...] "metaphor for the possibility of the evolution of the human spirit, the evolution of human understanding." [...] Without dictating how the audience should feel {{by the end of the}} film, Cuarón encourages viewers to come to their own conclusions about the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> depicted in the final scenes: [...] "We wanted the end to be a glimpse of a possibility of hope, for the audience to invest their own <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> into that ending. So if you're a hopeful person you'll see a lot of hope, and if you're a bleak person you'll see a complete hopelessness at the end." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the paper I {{consider}} the relative neglect <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> in the tradition of critical theory.

500|$|Generally, Joseph's music gets airplay in {{the adult}} contemporary, smooth jazz, easy listening, and {{beautiful}} music radio formats, and while some is classified in the new age genre, he considers contemporary instrumental to fit his style of playing the best. [...] In discussing Rapture, John Blake of The Atlanta Journal notes that often new age music sounds as if it should be played in a supermarket. The songs can sound like musical cotton candy — soft, airy and ultimately uninteresting. [...] "For the most part, Bradley's music doesn't make that mistake." [...] "The music is cinematic, filled with introspective piano solos, swelling violins, and a hypnotic song pacing that allows the listener to daydream." [...] Along the same line, Michael Debbage of Mainly Piano says that Rapture almost single-handedly gave a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> that {{there was much more}} that the New Age genre could offer.

500|$|In , hope is {{suppressed}} by the dictatorship. As the Judge Advocate {{states in the}} novel, [...] "the President's first rule of conduct is never to give grounds for hope, and everyone must be kicked and beaten until they realise the fact". It {{can be argued that}} Camila represents hope in the novel because both her father and husband were able to persevere under the dictatorship by thinking of her; however, the President destroys this <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> with false stories. When the thought of her loyalty is eliminated, both her father and husband die because they have lost the hope of returning to her. Furthermore, Camila's happiness with her child and their escape to the countryside {{can be seen as the}} one glimpse of hope in an otherwise dark and disturbing ending. For critic Jean Franco, it is love that offers what little hope there is in the novel: [...] "The system is undermined only by lovethe love of an idiot for his mother, a woman trying desperately to save her husband from death." ...|$|E

The songs explore topics and issues in contemporary society and culture, including gentrification, identity politics, and mass consumption, accompanied by a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> in Hunt's lyrics.

Michael Gipson of Creative Loafing notes David Bowie and Lenny Kravitz as references points for Hunt's songwriting, and writes that What Were You Hoping For? explores [...] "both sides of the political aisles" [...] with metaphorical songs such as [...] "North Hollywood", [...] "Designer Jeans", and the title track, as well as themes concerning an intimate relationship with the songs [...] "Moving Targets", [...] "Falls (Violet)", and [...] "Cross Dresser".|$|E
500|$|It took Watts {{three months}} into {{his first season}} before he made his debut with the club {{choosing}} their biggest match {{of the year to}} name him for his debut, the Queen's Birthday clash against Collingwood. The fanfare and expectation the club placed on him for his debut has led to long-term criticism of the club about how they mismanaged his first match; five years after his debut, Paul Roos said he was appalled at how the club handled him for his debut. His first touch of the football saw him [...] "gang tackled" [...] by three Collingwood players, with some suggesting the tackle [...] "ruined him"; teammate on the day, Russell Robertson, dispelled these thoughts and said the team did not do enough to protect him, with the Collingwood captain at the time, Nick Maxwell, admitting in 2016 that the hype surrounding Watts did lead them to purposely be rougher with him than a standard player to ensure they limited his impact. Despite then-senior coach, Dean Bailey, claiming he was ready to play and keeping him in the team for three weeks, the football industry disagreed and scrutinised the club for using him as a marketing tool to provide a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> for fans rather than doing what was best for Watts' development.|$|E

VanDerWerff wrote positively of [...] "most of the Scully scenes", noting that Anderson [...] "found some of the raw <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> and loss" [...] that the shots required. However, he was critical of the episode's plot, arguing that it only [...] "goes through the motions" [...] and [...] "is about everybody getting really worked up over a little girl we’ve just met." [...] He concluded that [...] "two-parter is strongest when it grabs hold of this notion. But it’s at its weakest when it turns into just another episode of The X-Files." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a 7 out of 10, and wrote [...] "Overall, this episode was not as strong as the previous installment, largely due to the shift from in-depth character exploration to a rehashing of earlier elements of the mythology. Emily is a good plot device in terms of personalizing the conspiracy’s depredations just a bit more, but at times, it seems like the writers are victimizing Scully a bit more than necessary. Unlike the later mythology episodes, however, this one manages to avoid any unnecessary new elements." ...|$|E
