Knowledge of genetic variants affecting risk of central obesity is {{largely based on}} genome-wide association studies of common SNPs in Europeans. To evaluate the contribution of DNA sequence variation to the higher levels of central obesity (defined as waist hip ratio adjusted for body mass index, WHR) among <b>South</b> <b>Asians</b> compared to Europeans we carried out: i) a genome-wide association analysis of > 6 M genetic variants in 10, 318 <b>South</b> <b>Asians</b> with focused analysis of population-specific SNPs; ii) an exome-wide association analysis of ~ 250 K SNPs in protein-coding regions in 2, 637 South Asians; iii) a comparison of risk allele frequencies and effect sizes of 48 known WHR SNPs in 12, 240 <b>South</b> <b>Asians</b> compared to Europeans. In genome-wide analyses, we found no novel associations between common genetic variants and WHR in <b>South</b> <b>Asians</b> at P< 5 x 10 - 8; variants showing equivocal association with WHR (P< 1 x 10 - 5) did not replicate at P< 0. 05 in an independent cohort of <b>South</b> <b>Asians</b> (N = 1, 922) or in published, predominantly European meta-analysis data. In the targeted analyses of 122, 391 population-specific SNPs we also found no associations with WHR in <b>South</b> <b>Asians</b> at P< 0. 05 after multiple testing correction. Exome-wide analyses showed no new associations between genetic variants and WHR in <b>South</b> <b>Asians,</b> either individually at P< 1. 5 x 10 - 6 or grouped by gene locus at P< 2. 5 x 10 - 6. At known WHR loci, risk allele frequencies were not higher in <b>South</b> <b>Asians</b> compared to Europeans (P = 0. 77), while effect sizes were unexpectedly smaller in <b>South</b> <b>Asians</b> than Europeans (P< 5. 0 x 10 - 8).

40|$|Aim To {{identify}} biochemical {{and genetic}} variation relating to {{increased risk of}} developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease in young, lean male and female adults of different ethnicities. Method Fasting blood and urine and non-fasting blood following oral glucose intake were analysed in 90 Caucasians, <b>South</b> <b>Asians</b> and <b>South</b> East/East <b>Asians.</b> Results There were no differences in age, birthweight, blood pressure, body mass index, percent body fat, total energy, percentage of macronutrient intake, microalbumin, leptin, cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, nitric oxide metabolites, C-reactive protein, homocysteine, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin- 6, von Willebrand factor, vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1, and tissue plasminogen activator. Fasting total cholesterol (P =. 000), triglycerides (P =. 050), low density lipoprotein (P =. 009) and non-fasting blood glucose (15 min) (P =. 024) were elevated in <b>South</b> <b>Asians</b> compared with Caucasians, {{but there was no}} significant difference in glucose area under curve (AUC). Non-fasting insulin in <b>South</b> <b>Asians</b> (15 – 120 min), in <b>South</b> East/East <b>Asians</b> (60 – 120 min), and insulin AUC in <b>South</b> <b>Asians</b> and <b>South</b> East/East <b>Asians,</b> were elevated compared with Caucasians (P≤ 0. 006). The molar ratio of C-peptide AUC/Insulin AUC (P =. 045) and adiponectin (P =. 037) were lower in <b>South</b> <b>Asians</b> compared with Caucasians. A significant difference in allele frequency distributions in Caucasians and <b>South</b> <b>Asians</b> was found for rs 2166706 (P = 0. 022) and rs 10830963 (P = 0. 009), which are both near the melatonin receptor MTNR 1 B. Conclusions Elevated non-fasting insulin exists in young <b>South</b> <b>Asians</b> of normal fasting glucose and insulin.

We hypothesized {{that it is}} the greater hyperglycaemia in <b>South</b> <b>Asians</b> that increases stroke risk, by adversely affecting cerebrovascular haemodynamics. Methods A population-based sample of 149 Europeans and 151 <b>South</b> <b>Asians</b> underwent metabolic profiling and concurrent measurement of finger BP using a Finapres and middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood flow velocity using transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Cerebrovascular autoregulation, cerebrovascular resistance [resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) ] were calculated. Means of cerebrovascular haemodynamic measures were compared by ethnicity, with the introduction of explanatory variables to a regression model to determine which variable could best account for ethnic differences.
