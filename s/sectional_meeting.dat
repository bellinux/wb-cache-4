40|$|Today's {{agricultural}} cooperatives {{management is}} tending {{to be led}} by executives and employees. It has produced many unconsous members in the organic whole system of an owner, a user, and a management person. In such a situation, the <b>sectional</b> <b>meeting</b> has maintained members' high concentration power as a business management organization decentralized within agricultural cooperatives. However, while the heterogeneity inside members is deepened, independence and autonomy in sectional meetings tend to fall. This paper takes up the apple <b>sectional</b> <b>meeting</b> in Kita Shishu Miyuki Agricultural Cooperative, and co-operation among members and collaboration betwween members and employees are considered, based on social capital theory. There were two apple sectional meetings, the initiative type of employees and the initiative type of <b>sectional</b> <b>meeting</b> officers, in a case agriculturral cooperative, and the concentration power of the latter was high. Based on the difference, we pointed out as following. In order to reconstruct co-operation among members, {{it is necessary to}} create a network from the activity which focused on the specific field, or nearness and to lead to positive feedback which encourages mutual co-oepration by making selfsacrifice of an officer into driving force. Moreover, in order to build collaboration between a <b>sectional</b> <b>meeting</b> member and an employee, the latter as the connecting person between the market and the members has to try hard continuously so that development of co-operation activity can match development of farm management. The co-operation as a horizontal network and the collaboration as a vertical network are built, and the soul of mutual support must be penetrated in these networks. Then, the member' social capital as resources will become abundant, and sectional meetings will develop stably. 今日の農協運営は，役職員主導の傾向が強い．それは，所有者・利用者・運営者の三位一体的性格に無自覚な組合員を多数生み出している．その中，農協内の分権的事業運営組織として，高い結集力を保ってきたのが部会である．ただ，部会員の異質化が進み，その自主性，主体性は低下している．そこで本論では，北信州みゆき農業協同組合管内のリンゴ部会を事例にとりあげ，生産者部会を具体的な場とする，部会員間の協同と，部会員と職員の協働の展望について，ソーシャル・キャピタル論に基づき考察した．事例農協管内には，職員主導型と部会役員主導型の二つのリンゴ部会があり，後者の結集力が高かった．その相違を踏まえて，協同の再構築には，特定の分野に焦点を当てた活動や近接性から部会員間のネットワークを創出し，さらに役員の献身性を駆動力として，部会員が相互に協力を促すポジティブフィードバックを導くべきことを指摘した．また，協働の構築には，職員が市場と部会員の連結を遂行し，協同活動の発展と農業経営の発展が一致するよう絶えず努力すべきことを指摘した．横のネットワークとしての協同，縦のネットワークとしての協働を構築し，それらネットワークにおいて，相互支援の考え方を貫けるならば，部会員のソーシャル・キャピタルは豊富なものとなり，部会は安定的に発展することとなろう...|$|E

40|$|In {{agricultural}} cooperatives, {{each member}} has three characters of an owner, a user, and a management person. But today, {{the character of}} the member as a management person is weak. In oeder for agricultural cooperatives to develop stably, a management sustem based on active participation of the members must be built up. This paper takes up the Hadanoshi Agricultural Cooperative (abbreviated to JA Hadano in the following) as a case. In JA Hadano, direct democracy is aimed for and each member's activity is performed actively. The {{purpose of this paper is}} considering the reform direction of JA management through a case analysis. The conclusions are as follows. Firstly, the basic direction of management reform was clarified. The consciousness “JA cannot be reformed” is deeply ingrained in the members with broadening of JA, diversification of its members, etc. We pointed out that the educational activity as OJT was important for changing such consciousness. Secondly, the characteristic of the organizational management in JA Hadano was clarified. In this JA, direct democracy, such as adoption of a system of general meeting, the discussion meeting in spring and autumn, is aimed at. As the result, the organizational climate, such as “speaking”, “listening”, are formed. We point out that democratic control is practiced under these organizational climates in JA Hadano. Thirdly, the characteristic of the organizational management in the strawberry <b>sectional</b> <b>meeting</b> was clarified. In this <b>sectional</b> <b>meeting,</b> a sustem is built to give its members wide management responsibility. And the member is not dependent on the employee thoufhtlessly. We pointed out that this <b>sectional</b> <b>meeting</b> is managed by member's condominium under the strong awareness of member as a management person. 農業協同組合における組合員は，所有者であり，利用者であり，運営者である，という三位一体的性格を持つ．しかし今日，運営者としての性格は弱い．農協の安定的な発展には，組合員の主体的な参画に基づいた，運営体制の確立が不可欠である．そこで本論では，直接民主主義を追求している秦野市農業協同組合を事例としてとりあげ，農協運営の改革方向について考察した．結論は，以下の通りである．第一に，運営改革の基本方向を明らかにした．農協の広域化，組合員の多様化などを背景として，「農協を変えることはできない」という意識が，組合員には深く刻まれている．その意識を変えるためには，OJTとしての教育活動が重要なことを指摘した．第二に，事例農協における組織運営の特質を明らかにした．事例農協では，総会方式の採用，春と秋の座談会など，直接民主主義が追求されている．その結果，組合員の「発言」する風土，役職員の「聴く」風土などに支えられ，民主的管理が実践されていることを明らかにした．第三に，事例農協のいちご部における組織運営の特質を明らかにした．事例部会では，運営責任を部員に広く持たせる体制が構築され，また，農協理事の経験者が所属している．それらの結果，部員の運営者としての強い自覚の下，共同統治によって運営されていることを明らかにした...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{problem of}} the study was to {{determine}} whether university students enrolled in a pre-service teacher training course and exposed to a group counseling procedure having as its major emphasis education in the affective domain could demonstrate a significant change in self-actualization when compared with similarly enrolled students who had not been exposed to the procedure. The investigation was designed to test the following hypotheses: 1. There will be a significant change in self-actualization in the group exposed to a group counseling procedure. The groups not exposed to a group counseling procedure will not evidence a change in self-actualization. 2. There will be a significant difference in growth toward self-actualization between the group exposed to a group counseling procedure and the groups not exposed to the procedure. 3. The posttest mean of the group exposed to a group counseling procedure will be similar to the mean of a clinically judged self-actualized sample. The groups not exposed to a group counseling procedure will not evidence posttest means similar to the mean of a clinically judged self-actualized sample. The sample {{of the study was}} selected from undergraduate and graduates in Oregon State University registered during the 1970 Winter Term for the nine class sections of Educational Psychology. The sample consisted of 103 students assigned to two class sections of the investigator and to one class section of another instructor. Student placement in the classes was determined by the computer assisted registration procedure. The investigator was the facilitator in the experimental group (Group I) of 30 students (12 male and 18 female) and one control group (Group 11) of 43 students (17 male and 26 female). Another instructor was the facilitator in the other control group (Group III) of 30 students (10 male and 20 female). All sections of Educational Psychology were coordinated under a special grant titled, "Student Centered Educational Psychology: An Experiential Approach. " The control groups received exposure to self-directed learning in and out of the class <b>sectional</b> <b>meetings.</b> The experimental group differed only in the class <b>sectional</b> <b>meetings</b> where they were exposed to experiential learning exercises. The class <b>sectional</b> <b>meetings</b> were two hours weekly for all three groups over a period of nine weeks. The experiential learning exercises were detailed for ease of replication. The Personal Orientation Inventory (POI) was the instrument utilized for the measurement of growth toward self-actualization or positive mental health. The instrument was administered under pre and posttest conditions to all three groups. The pre-posttest gains on the Inner Directed (I) Scale were utilized for the testing of the three major hypotheses by means of one-tailed and two-tailed t tests. The. 05 level of confidence was selected as the acceptable level of statistical significance. Findings for the three hypotheses revealed there was an increase in self-actualization for the experimental and two control groups which was significant at the. 001 level for all three groups; there was no significant difference in growth toward self-actualization between the experimental and two control groups; and the pre-test means were similar to a normal sample for all three groups while the experimental and one control group (Group II) showed posttest means similar to a clinically judged self-actualized sample. In the experimental group growth producing effects were chosen by a facilitator with the intent of providing experiences in the affective domain which would result in growth toward self-actualization for college students in a pre-service teacher training course. In the two control groups college students in a pre-service teacher training course were given the opportunity to direct their own learning and chose experiences which resulted in their growth toward self-actualization. The effectiveness in terms of growth toward self-actualization of the two methods seems to have been demonstrated. Although differential effects relative to the hypotheses were not generally indicated, some differences appeared which were related to sex, tutoring, and to growth toward a level of clinically judged self-actualized status in the case of the experimental group...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Approximately 400, 000 patients shall be enrolled in this multicentric, cross <b>sectional</b> study. Patients <b>meeting</b> eligibility criteria shall be screened for MAU through urine dipstick test using random daytime single spot urine specimen. Result shall be expressed either positive or negative based on {{the presence or absence}} of albumin in the urine and will be correlated with the corresponding random blood glucose. Height, weight, waist circumference and blood pressure shall be assessed. There will be three visits with a minimum interval of 28 days between two visits, to be completed within 180 days, and at least two of three urine tests measured in this period must show elevated albumin levels to diagnose MAU. Conclusion: Detection of MAU through the dipstick method is postulated to be a rapid, reliable test for early detection of diabetic nephropathy, which, in turn will help the physician to plan treatment strategy. Further, it will help to identify the disease burden on the individual and society, and may serve as an objective cue for improved health care seeking behavior, as well as a catalyst for health policy change...|$|R

The main research results are as follows. Firstly, the production district can be regarded as an organization, and it became clear that the double relationships which exist between principal and agent are established among farm households, shipment associations and the agricultural cooperative. Moreover, it became clear that Peach <b>sectional</b> <b>meeting</b> exists as an adjustmental organization between the shipment associstions and the agricultural cooperative. Secondly, We examined the process of talks and their rupture concerning the integration of pooling among shipment associations based on March=Simon organization conflict theory. Especially, organizational conflict was generated over the conditions for the integration of pooling, and it became clear that there were three confrontational axes which : between a functional organization and territorial organizations, between leaders of shipment associations and general farm households, and between large-scale and small-scale territorial organizations. Thirdly, the action which each shipment took after such organizational conflict had arisen, can be regarded as the adapational action to such conflicts, and the shipment associations were generally reorganized into three large groups. As for the direction of agricultural cooperative marketing in the future, we pointed out that it is important for integration of pooling not to be aimed at by these three groups, but that each group should raise functionality through movements at the individual level...|$|E

The analysis of such ballads, plot types and epic songs was carried out: 1) British №  10 : “The Twa Sisters” (21 variants); American “The Two Sisters”(5 variants) and Ukrainian plot type I – C- 5 : “the elder sister drowns the younger one because of envy and jealousy” (8 variants); 2) British №  26 : The Three Ravens” (2), “The Twa Corbies” (2); American “The Three Ravens” (1), “The Two Crows”(1) and Ukrainian epic songs with the motif of lonely death of a Cossack warrior on the steppe (4).
