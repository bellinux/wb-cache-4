6000|$|On the {{following}} day we marched to Yoksun: the weather was fair, though it was evidently snowing on the mountains above. I halted at the Ratong river, {{at the foot of}} Mon Lepcha, where I found its elevation to be 7,150 feet; its edges were frozen, and the temperature of the water 36 degrees; it is here a furious torrent flowing between gneiss rocks which dip south-south-east, and is flanked by flat-topped beds of boulders, gravel and sand, twelve to fourteen feet thick. Its vegetation resembles that of Dorjiling, but is more alpine, owing no doubt to the proximity of Kinchinjunga. The magnificent Rhododendron argenteum was growing on its banks. On the other hand, I was surprised to see a beautiful fern (a Trichomanes, very like the Irish one) which is not found at Dorjiling. The same day, at about the same elevation, I gathered sixty species of fern, many of very tropical forms.* [They consisted of the above-mentioned Trichomanes, three Hymenophyllae, Vittaria, Pleopeltis, and Marattia, together with several Selaginellas.] No doubt the range of such genera is extended in proportion to the extreme damp and equable climate, here, as about Dorjiling. Tree-ferns are however absent, and neither plantains, epiphytical Orchideae, nor palms, are so abundant, or ascend so high as on the outer ranges. About Yoksun itself, which occupies a very warm <b>sheltered</b> <b>flat,</b> many tropical genera occur, such as tall bamboos of two kinds, grasses allied to the sugar-cane, scarlet Erythrina, and various Araliaceae, amongst which was one species whose pith was of so curious a structure, that I had no hesitation in considering the then unknown Chinese substance called rice-paper to belong to a closely allied plant.* [The Chinese rice-paper has long been known to be cut from cylinders of pith which has always a central hollow chamber, divided into compartments by septa or excessively thin plates. It is only within the last few months that my supposition has been confirmed, by my father's receiving from China, after many years of correspondence, specimens of the rice-paper plant itself, which very closely resemble, in botanical characters, as well as in outward appearance of size and habit, the Sikkim plant.] ...|$|E
50|$|Acropora {{indonesia}} is {{a species of}} acroporid coral that was first described by Dr Carden Wallace in 1997. Found in marine, tropical, shallow reefs in <b>sheltered</b> <b>flat</b> locations or gentle slopes, it occurs at depths of 10 to 20 m. It is listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List, and it {{is thought to have}} a decreasing population. It is common and found over a large area, and is listed on CITES Appendix II.|$|E
50|$|His name also {{lives on}} in a block of <b>sheltered</b> <b>flats</b> for the elderly built by Southwark Council on Reedham Street in Peckham.|$|R
50|$|The Crewe Almshouses {{remain in}} use as <b>sheltered</b> <b>flats</b> for the elderly. They are now {{administered}} by a joint body of trustees {{for all the}} surviving Nantwich almshouses, together with the adjacent Wright's and Harriet Hope Almshouses.|$|R
50|$|By the 1960s, the Crewe Almshouses {{were in a}} poor condition, and the {{building}} was threatened with demolition. It was saved by a plan which involved moving the Wright's Almshouses from London Road to stand adjacent to the Crewe Almshouses, converting the Crewe Almshouses into flats for the elderly, and constructing modern facilities shared by both former almshouses. The new complex was completed in 1975, and Crewe Almshouses remain in use as <b>sheltered</b> <b>flats</b> for the elderly.|$|R

5000|$|The {{legal status}} of a Tyneside flat, and the {{responsibilities}} between their landlords, is complicated by their interdependency. The upper <b>flat</b> <b>shelters</b> the lower <b>flat,</b> the lower flat supports the upper flat. This has led to specific legal schemes, known as Tyneside flat, criss-cross, or crossover lease arrangements.|$|R
50|$|Gunter was re-elected in his Southwark {{constituency}} at the 1970 {{general election}} {{that saw the}} Labour government replaced by a Conservative one led by Edward Heath. He was by now a senior opposition backbencher and resigned from Parliament in 1972 and was succeeded by Harry Lamborn. Gunter died in 1977 and was buried at St. Mary's Old Church, St. Mary's on the Isles of Scilly. For many years he had {{a house on the}} Isles of Scilly, located in Launceston Close, Old Town, and called Y Bwythen Bach. His name lives on in a block of <b>sheltered</b> <b>flats</b> for the elderly built by Southwark Council in Walworth.|$|R
50|$|The {{floor of}} the <b>shelter</b> is <b>flat</b> and dry. The walls {{are made up of}} a coarse conglomerate, which {{weathered}} and eventually covered the floor with small waterworn pebbles. Floor deposits are full of small holes because of termites.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{many other}} pipefishes, male {{members of this}} genus carry their young in a brood pouch {{underneath}} the tail. These small, secretive fishes live in shallow algae or reef habitats, and in tidal pools and <b>sheltered</b> reef <b>flats.</b> Some species are known to venture into deeper waters.|$|R

40|$|In {{the next}} 20 years {{every country in}} Western Europe will see a rise in its total numbers of people aged over 60, and since old people are now living longer the {{proportion}} aged over 75 will also rise. Both physical and mental disorders become much more common between 60 and 75, so that if these old people are to be provided with accommodation and medical services at contemporary standards many more places will be needed in <b>sheltered</b> <b>flats,</b> nursing homes, and geriatric hospitals. Yet in the current economic recession most European countries are trying {{to cut back on}} public expenditure. How do politicians and administrators reconcile the conflict between the demands created by demographic change and the freeze on public spending? How will the care of the elderly change in response to this conflict? Tony Smith is examining the ways in which old people are looked after in several European countries and their plans for the future. This first article deals with Denmark...|$|R

5000|$|In January 2007, Torbay Council {{announced}} that it was considering selling the mansion as it had become too expensive to maintain. The suggestion was controversial, since local residents argued that the mansion was sold at a reduced price on the understanding that it would be open to the public. On 30 April 2012, plans for Oldway Mansion to be converted into a luxury hotel and <b>sheltered</b> retirement <b>flats</b> were approved by Torbay Council. The deal was finalised in September 2012.|$|R
50|$|The shelter was {{designed}} to hold 48 people and, according to the Environment Trust, was built in 1938 and extended in 1941. It has four rooms (two for men and two for women, separated by a central corridor) and a particularly well-preserved interior with some original fittings. According to Historic England, it has some similarities to W Braxton Sinclair's design of a sophisticated air raid <b>shelter</b> for <b>flats</b> at Queen's Gate, in South Kensington, London, {{which was published in}} The Builder in October 1938.|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} {{buildings}} on the lot. The main house is a two-story timber frame house on a stone foundation sided in clapboard with fish-scale shingle in {{the apex of the}} front cross-gable on the main hipped roof. The similarly cross-gabled west side projects slightly from just north of the main entrance, <b>sheltered</b> by a <b>flat</b> roof. There is a white picket fence at the street.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Cassia species, {{including}} Cassia obtusifolia, Cassia alata, Cassia bahamensis, Cassia fistula, Cassia javanica and Cassia siamea. Young larvae bore in {{the terminal}} shoots of the host plant. Later, they bind together several leaflets with silk to form a <b>flat</b> <b>shelter.</b> They feed on the inner epidermis and mesophyll of these leaflets from within their shelter. Several larvae {{may be found in}} a single shelter.|$|R
50|$|After {{the eggs}} {{have been laid}} by the female flounder, larvae take four to five days to hatch when reared in {{controlled}} conditions, at 15 Â°C, in the laboratory. The embryo has a small yolk which feeds the larva as it drifts with the tide from a pelagic environment, towards the shallow and <b>sheltered</b> mud/sand <b>flats</b> along the coastline. Because the yolk cannot sustain the larva for very long, adult flounder try to breed {{in areas that are}} as close to the coastline as possible, whilst maintaining the right conditions for spawning. This reduces {{the amount of time that}} the larva spends feeding itself when drifting with the tides and ensures that the maximum number of offspring reach the inshore waters.|$|R
50|$|The {{embankment}} is {{all that}} remains of the former Down platform. All of the station buildings have now been removed and replaced with a bus <b>shelter.</b> The <b>flats</b> in the background (known as The Kyles) are built in what was the station goods yard. There was also a coal yard located in this area. Inverkip also had its own signal box, located {{at the end of the}} down platform. In the 1950s and 1960s, an old railway carriage was located in the goods yard and used as a camping coach. At the further end of the yard area, where the housing development is located, are the parapets of a metal overbridge, presumably used to move goods across from the up platform.|$|R
50|$|Located on {{the east}} side of the town of Newton in a cemetery. The rock shelter is 8 meters long, 2 meters high and 2 meters deep. This shelter is in the Epler Dolomite. The rock wall is 6 meters high and is 186 meters above sea level. The area around the <b>shelter</b> is fairly <b>flat</b> to {{slightly}} rolling. There is a small creek located 1 kilometer way. This site is on religious property.|$|R
25|$|Tralee Bay Wetlands and Nature Reserve: Tralee Bay Nature Reserve is {{a site of}} {{considerable}} international importance. It covers some 2,500 ha (8,000 acres) and stretches from Tralee town westwards to Fenit Harbour and Cloghane, encompassing Tralee Bay, Brandon Bay and the Magharees Peninsula. It includes extensive mudflats at the eastern end, the beaches of Derrymore Island, the sand dunes and lagoons of the Magharees Peninsula. Both the River Lee and Brandon (Owenmore) estuaries feature wide expanses of <b>sheltered</b> intertidal <b>flats,</b> often fringed with saltmarsh vegetation. The Wetlands Centre which opened in 2012 is designed as {{a microcosm of the}} wild nature reserve where visitors are introduced to the fresh and saltwater habitats. Visitors can travel on a safari boat ride through the recreated reed and freshwater channels in the centre.|$|R

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} {{kindergarten}} on a particular building site in the village of Netin. The aim is to create a functional layout suitable for everyday use. It is a two-floor construction without a cellar which can accommodate 40 pre-school children. The building has been designed using the construction software system KM BETA and is <b>sheltered</b> with a <b>flat</b> roof on the one-floor part and with a shed roof on the two-floor part...|$|R
5000|$|Hastings, {{an ancient}} seaside {{town on the}} Sussex coast, was an {{important}} settlement by the 12th century: it had its own castle and mint, and was the main Cinque Port. With seven churches, {{it was also a}} religious centre. [...] To the west, an area of undeveloped landâpart of the Manor of Gensingâran down to the English Channel coast and offered excellent views. Consisting of a well-wooded valley leading to <b>flat,</b> <b>sheltered</b> land by a beach, it had the potential for residential development.|$|R
50|$|The lakes on {{the coastal}} plain were {{particularly}} important to the Aboriginal people, providing them with both spiritual and physical sustenance. The swamps {{to the north of}} the river provided food, meeting places, shelter, and familiar hunting grounds. Fish, turtles, oysters, crabs, birds and their eggs, frogs, edible roots, fungi, kangaroos and possums abounded. The waters were fringed with tea-tree, grass trees and paper bark, the last providing <b>shelter.</b> The large <b>flat</b> spaces of the swamp flood plains created natural amphitheatres for ceremonies and camping.|$|R
50|$|When she {{discovers that}} he has been cut off by his father without a penny, the gold-digging singer Cora Sutherland {{abandons}} her fiancÃ©e Guy Rogers.

Guy must persuade her straight-laced mother to allow them to marry while trying to fend off Cora who has heard about the relationship and sports an opportunity for blackmail.|$|R
50|$|Acropora lokani {{is found}} in colonies up to 30 cm wide and {{consisting}} of upright strong branches. It is brown, cream or blue in colour, and its branches have diameters of 5 to 7 mm and may grow to 20 mm long. The branches divide into branchlets, which contain axial, incipient axial, and radial corallites. The axial corallites are located {{on the end of}} the branchlets and are large and tube-shaped, with inner diameters of between 0.6 and 0.9 mm and outer diameters of 2.2 to 2.6 mm. The radial corallites are small and are both surrounded by and contain elaborate spinules. The species looks similar to Acropora caroliniana and Acropora granulosa. It {{is found in}} <b>sheltered</b> lagoons, <b>flats</b> of shallow reefs, patch reefs, and in other shallow marine environments. It occurs at depths of between 8 and 25 m. It is composed of aragonite (calcium carbonate).|$|R

50|$|Zostera muelleri is a {{perennial}} species, meaning populations of it endure year round. They are mostly found {{in places such}} as littoral or sublittoral sand <b>flats,</b> <b>sheltered</b> coastal embayments, soft, muddy, sandy areas near a reef, estuaries, shallow bays, and in intertidal shoals. They arenât common on reefs because there is little space and nutrients for them to grow there. Zostera muelleri is a marine species, but it can tolerate some freshwater inputs. It mostly occurs in mono-specific meadows, but it can grow alongside Ruppia, Halophila, and Lepilena. Zostera muelleri is widespread in Southern Australia, and its also found in New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.|$|R
