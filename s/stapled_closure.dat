40|$|Transanal total mesorectal {{excision}} (taTME) is {{an emerging}} technique in rectal cancer surgery. As with all novel techniques, new challenges arise, requiring small modifications. Transanal TME presents the surgeon with a challenge when forming a stapled anastomosis because a linear stapler {{is not used}} to transect the rectum during this procedure, instead the distal rectal wall is divided {{at the start of}} the transanal dissection. This leaves the distal rectal end open, requiring the use of a purse-string suture to close it before a stapled anastomosis can be fashioned. Accurate positioning of the stapler from the transanal side may be difficult without a <b>stapled</b> <b>closure</b> of the distal rectal stump because the shaft of the stapler must pass through the centre of the purse-string. To overcome this, some surgeons have used a long-shaft haemorrhoid stapler, but the functional impact of this stapler with its wider diameter and extra tissue bulk incorporated into the anastomosis is unknown. We present a simple technique that we have devised to facilitate a stapled anastomosis following a transanal TME using a standard circular stapler. This article is protected by copyright.

The dogs were sacrificed at 24 hours, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 days after pneumonectomy. Brochial stump leakage pressures and histological studies were performed on all specimens. Differences in the exudative reaction between silk and <b>staple</b> <b>closures</b> were significant on day 5 (238. 19 +/- 23. 28 SD PMN's/HPF in silk closures, 34. 95 +/- 20. 37 SD PMN's/HPF in <b>staple</b> <b>closures)</b> and therafter(P less than 0. 001). The reaction to nylon was intermediate between silk and staple. Collagen levels were highest at all periods for <b>staple</b> <b>closures.</b> <b>Staple</b> leakage pressures were greater than silk or nylon(day 5 : 145. 3 mm Hg +/- 64. 9 SD in <b>staple</b> <b>closures,</b> 40. 2 mm Hg +/- 15. 4 SD in silk closures).

40|$|Background. The {{appropriate}} {{management of}} the pancreatic remnant following distal pancreatic resection remains a clinically relevant problem. We carried out a retrospective analysis which focused on this issue and compared the two favored techniques of suture and <b>staple</b> <b>closure.</b> Patients and methods. Forty-six patients underwent distal pancreatectomy between October 1999 and January 2006. The patients were retrospectively analysed based on the {{management of the}} remaining pancreatic gland. Thirty-seven patients had suture and nine patients had <b>staple</b> <b>closure.</b> The morbidity, mortality, incidence of pancreatic fistula, necessity of secondary surgical intervention, and the duration of hospital stay for the two groups were compared. Pancreatic fistula was considered according to the novel international standard definition (ISGPF). In addition, subgroup analysis of patients receiving octreotide was carried out. Results. Overall, postoperative morbidity due to pancreatic fistula occurred in seven patients (19 %) after suture and in one patient (11 %) after <b>staple</b> <b>closure</b> (p =  0. 54), with no deaths. The number of patients with surgical revision related to pancreatic leakage was two (5 %) after suture closure vs no revision after <b>staple</b> <b>closure</b> (p =  0. 65).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the difference in}} wound complication and infection rates between suture and <b>staple</b> <b>closure</b> techniques applied to clean incisions in coronary bypass patients. BACKGROUND: The true incidence of postoperative wound complications, and their correlation with closure techniques, has been obscured by study designs incorporating small numbers, retrospective short follow-up, uncontrolled host factors, and narrowly defined complications. METHODS: Sternal and leg wounds were studied prospectively, each patient serving as {{his or her own}} control. Two hundred forty-two patients with sternal and saphenous vein harvest wounds had half of each wound closed with staples and the other half with intradermal sutures (484 sternal and 516 leg segments). Wound complications were defined as drainage, erythema, separation, necrosis, seroma, or infection. Infections were identified in the subset having purulent drainage, antibiotic therapy, or debridement. Wounds were examined at discharge, at 1 week after discharge, and at 3 to 4 weeks after operation. Patient preferences for closure type were assessed 3 to 4 weeks after operation. RESULTS: Neither leg nor sternal wounds had a statistically significant difference in infection rate according to closure method (leg sutured = 9. 3 % vs. leg stapled = 8. 9 %; p = 0. 99, and sternal sutured = 0. 4 % vs. sternal stapled = 2. 5 %; p = 0. 128). There was, however, a greater complication rate in stapled segments (leg stapled = 46. 9 % vs. leg sutured = 32. 6 %; p = 0. 001, and sternal stapled = 14. 9 % vs. sternal sutured = 3. 7 %; p = 0. 00005). Sutures were favored over staples among patients who expressed a preference (sternal = 75. 6 %, leg = 74. 6 %). CONCLUSIONS: With the host factors controlled by pairing staples and sutures in each patient, we demonstrated a similar incidence of infection but a significantly lower incidence of total wound complications with intradermal suture <b>closure</b> than with <b>staple</b> <b>closure...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{roles of}} {{inflammatory}} response and closure technique {{in the development}} of bronchopleural fistula were evaluated. Canine bronchial stumps closed with 3 - 0 silk and studied 14 days later were characterized by a dense inflammatory infiltrate. Stumps closed with 3 - 0 chromic catgut suture showed a moderate inflammatory response with disintegration of suture material. However, stumps closed with the automatic stapling device (TA- 30) showed the best healing and a minimal degree of inflammation. These findings correlated well with leakage pressures. The average leakage pressure for the silk closed stumps was 139. 44 mm Hg plus or minus 78. 9 SD. This was significantly lower (P less than 0. 02) than the average leakage pressure for staple closed stumps (251. 25 mm Hg plus or minus 82. 9 SD).

40|$|Sutureline {{blood flow}} was {{measured}} with laser Doppler velocimetry in colonic anastomoses created with the stapler, manual suturing, or a combination. Blood flow was always reduced in the sutureline compared with normal mucosa. Of all the anastomoses studied, tight stapling reduced sutureline blood flow the most, whereas the two-layered manual anastomosis or stapling reinforced with sutures were somewhat less ischemic. Stapling adjusted to bowel wall thickness impaired flow only moderately. It was possible with practice to outperform the stapler by single-layered manual anastomosis using fine sutures. In humans, stapled ileocolostomy had a higher sutureline blood flow than the two-layered manual anastomosis. In view of the existing clinical experience of safe stapling without adjustment for bowel wall thickness, a low sutureline blood flow is probably tolerated to a considerable degree in humans. However, this study clearly shows that tight stapling can reduce sutureline blood flow unduly, whereas superior blood supply can be attained by attention to <b>staple</b> <b>closure</b> height relative to bowel wall thickness...|$|R

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about the {{integrity}} of staple-closure of the bronchus and its tolerance to normal mechanical stresses (cough, sneezing, etc.) in the immediate early post-operative period. There are few studies which tested the mechanical strength of <b>stapled</b> bronchial <b>closure</b> compared with manually closed bronchi using the threshold for fluid leak across the bronchial suture line which differs from air. Material and methods: Intact cadaveric tracheobronchial tree (n = 40) were selected, age range from 55 to 70, of which 60 % were males. They were divided into two groups: group A, 20 left bronchi were closed with RLV 30 Ethicon Ò 4. 8 mm bronchial stapler; group B, 20 were closed with 4 0 Prolene Ò simple interrupted sutures. All specimens were intubated with endotracheal tube and submerged under water before testing the immediate air leak with the standard 40 mm Hg inflation pressure. Inflation pressure was increased until air leak was detected. The <b>stapled</b> <b>closures</b> were resected and subjected to radiological examination. Results: No air leak was detected in any bronchus at 40 mmHg regardless of the closure technique. The median leakage pressure was significantly higher in the hand sutured bronchi compared to the stapled group (200 vs. 105 mmHg, respectively) and 50 % (n = 10) leaked from multiple sites in the stapled group compared with leakage from one site only in group B, this difference was statistically significant P, 0. 001.

40|$|AbstractSurgical staples made of pure {{titanium}} and {{titanium alloys}} {{are widely used}} in gastrointestinal anastomosis.

40|$|Objective: To assess {{risk factors}} for {{celiotomy}} incisional infection in horses, especially the use of <b>staples</b> for skin <b>closure.</b> Study Design: Case series. Animals: Horses (n = 356) that had 1 exploratory celiotomy for colic and survived > 2 weeks after surgery between March 1, 2004 and December 31, 2007. Methods; Incisions were classified as “normal” (no complication, only edema, serous drainage lasting < 24 hours) or as “surgical site infection (SSI) ” (persistent serosanguinous drainage or purulent drainage with or without positive bacterial culture). All possible risk factors, including method of skin closure (monofilament sutures or staples), were statistically analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Of 356 horses, 303 (85 %) had normal wound healing and 53 (15 %) developed a SSI (purulent: 48 [14 %]; persistent serosanguinous: 5 [1 %]). Bacterial cultures were positive in 33 of 40 cases. Factors significantly associated with SSI in the multivariate analysis were: use of <b>staples</b> for skin <b>closure</b> (OR 3. 85, P <. 001) and surgical site closure by a 1 st or 2 nd year resident (OR 2. 20, P =. 016).

40|$|Staplers have {{improved}} {{the results of}} esophageal surgery, in our experience and in others experience, as esophago-enteric anastomoses have become safer and faster than when manual suturing is used. Probably {{one of the last}} problems in the stapler technique, especially in the thoracic area, is the performance of on adequate esophageal purse-string suture: an improper performance of this suture can cause a dangerous leak of the anastomosis. So, many surgeons, {{to reduce the risk of}} esophageal dehiscence connected with the esophageal purse-string, use either purse-string devices or alternative methods such as a second handsewn purse-string, U stitches of the esophagus, etc. We think that the risk of improper anastomoses after esophageal resection can be reduced if the need for the esophageal purse-string can be eliminated. This work shows our personal technique for performing esophagoenterostomy, especially in the thoracic area, using the new CEEA stapler (Autosuture) without esophageal purse-string sutures. According to the modified procedure the stapler anvil and the mini rod are introduced in the esophagectomy and a 2 - 0 thread is knotted around the CEEA mini rod. Then the esophageal mutilated part is closed by a linear stapler keeping a syringe needle, which contains the thread, through the linear suture. Then, using the thread as a pulling system, the surgeon makes the needle and the tip of the mini rod slide out of the esophageal suture. Now the surgeon can reassemble the CEEA and perform the anastomosis. There are many clinical reports that cite no leaks following circular stapled anastomoses across linear <b>stapled</b> <b>closures...</b>|$|R

In addition, negative pressure dressings can be used to safely and effectively treat a non-infected draining surgical wound.

40|$|Abstract Background Colorectal {{cancer is}} the second most common tumor in {{developed}} countries, with a lifetime prevalence of 5 %. About one third of these tumors are located in the rectum. Surgery in terms of low anterior resection with mesorectal excision is the central element in the treatment of rectal cancer being the only option for definite cure. Creating a protective diverting stoma prevents complications like anastomotic failure and meanwhile is the standard procedure. Bowel obstruction {{is one of the main}} and the clinically and economically most relevant complication following closure of loop ileostomy. The best surgical technique for closure of loop ileostomy has not been defined yet. Methods/Design A study protocol was developed on the basis of the only randomized controlled mono-center trial to solve clinical equipoise concerning the optimal surgical technique for closure of loop ileostomy after low anterior resection due to rectal cancer. The HASTA trial is a multi-center pragmatic randomized controlled surgical trial with two parallel groups to compare hand-suture versus <b>stapling</b> for <b>closure</b> of loop ileostomy. It will include 334 randomized patients undergoing closure of loop ileostomy after low anterior resection with protective ileostomy due to rectal cancer in approximately 20 centers consisting of German hospitals of all level of health care. The primary endpoint is the rate of bowel obstruction within 30 days after ileostomy closure. In addition, a set of surgical and general variables including quality of life will be analyzed with a follow-up of 12 months. An investigators meeting with a practical session will help to minimize performance bias and enforce protocol adherence. Centers are monitored centrally as well as on-site before and during recruitment phase to assure inclusion, treatment and follow up according to the protocol.

Therefore, metallic surgical implants were assessed at 3 -Tesla for magnetic field interactions, MRI-related heating, and artifacts. Methods A skin <b>closure</b> <b>staple</b> (Visistat Skin Stapler, staple, Polytetrafluoroethylene, PTFE, coated 316 L/ 316 LVM stainless steel; Teleflex Medical, Durham, NC) and a vessel ligation clip (Hemoclip Traditional, stainless steel; Teleflex Medical, Durham, NC) that represented the largest metallic sizes made from materials with the highest magnetic susceptibilities (i. e., based on material information) among 61 other surgical implants (52 metallic implants, 9 nonmetallic implants) underwent evaluation for magnetic field interactions, MRI-related heating, and artifacts using standardized techniques. MRI-related heating was assessed by placing each implant in a gelled-saline-filled phantom with MRI performed using a transmit/receive RF body coil at an MR system reported, whole body averaged SAR of 2. 9 -W/kg for 15 -min. Artifacts were characterized using T 1 -weighted, SE and GRE pulse sequences. Results Each surgical implant showed minor magnetic field interactions (20 - and 27 -degrees, which is acceptable from a safety consideration). Heating was not substantial (highest temperature change, ≤ 1. 6 °C). Artifacts may create issues if the area of interest is in the same area or close to the respective surgical implant. Conclusions The results demonstrated that it would be acceptable for patients with these metallic surgical implants to undergo MRI at 3 -Tesla or less. Because of the materials and dimensions of the surgical implants that underwent testing, these findings pertain to 61 additional similar implants. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background/Purpose. To {{determine}} the incidence, predictors, and outcomes of repair of gastrocutaneous fistulae (GCF) in pediatric patients. Methods. Patients were identified through a medical records search of all gastrostomy insertions performed from 1997 – 2007. Results. Of 1083 gastrostomies, 49 had GCF closure. Gastrostomy indications were reflux/aspiration (30 / 43 [70 %]) and feeding intolerance/failure to thrive (7 / 43 [16 %]). Gastrostomies were performed as open surgical procedures (84 %) with fundoplication (66 % of all cases) {{at an age}} of 0. 5 ± 0. 57 (median ± inter-quartile range) years. Gastrostomies were removed in outpatient settings when no longer used and were present for 2. 3 ± 2. 2 years, and GCF persisted for 2. 0 ± 3. 0 months. GCF were closed by laparotomy and <b>stapling.</b> GCF <b>closure</b> length of stay was 2. 0 ± 3. 3 days. Complications occurred in 6 / 49 patients and included infection/fever (4 / 6) and localized skin redness/breakdown (2 / 6). Conclusions. From our collected data, GCFs occur at a frequency of 4. 5 % and persist for 2. 0 ± 3. 0 months until closed. Given the complicated medical histories of patients and relatively high rate of postoperative infection/reaction (12. 2 %), GCF closure is not a benign, “uncomplicated” procedure. Further information describing factors determining which patients develop GCF requiring closure is needed...|$|R
40|$|In a {{prospective}} randomized study, 52 lacerations requiring closure {{in the emergency}} department were either stapled or sutured. Six participating emergency physicians closed the wounds and recorded data about the laceration and the treatment provided. Patients visited their own family physicians for removal of the closures. Forty family physicians removed closures from 44 lacerations and reported follow-up data on discomfort levels, ease of closure removal, and cosmetic results. Lacerations were closed 2. 7 times faster by the staple method (p< 0. 001), {{and there were no}} clinically {{significant differences between the two}} methods with respect to discomfort, infection rates, cosmetic result, or ease of removal. The staple device we used was more expensive than sutures. We concluded that the <b>staple</b> method of <b>closure</b> is safe, comfortable, and effective in the emergency department setting, and that the method's speed offsets its greater expense in some circumstances...|$|R

40|$|We {{undertook}} a {{randomised controlled trial}} to compare the outcomes of skin adhesive and <b>staples</b> for skin <b>closure</b> in total hip replacement. The primary outcome was the cosmetic appearance of the scar at three months using a surgeon-rated visual analogue scale. In all, 90 patients were randomised to skin closure using either skin adhesive (n = 45) or staples (n = 45). Data on demographics, surgical details, infection and oozing were collected during the in-patient stay. Further data on complications, patient satisfaction and evaluation of cosmesis were collected at three-month follow-up, and {{a photograph of the}} scar was taken. An orthopaedic and a plastic surgeon independently evaluated the cosmetic appearance of the scars from the photographs. No significant difference was found between groups in the cosmetic appearance of scars at three months (p = 0. 172), the occurrence of complications (p = 0. 3), or patient satisfaction (p = 0. 42). Staples were quicker and easier to use than skin adhesive and also less expensive. Skin adhesive and surgical staples are both effective skin closure methods in total hip replacement. When considering improvements in surgical techniques and faster rehabilitation followin...|$|R
