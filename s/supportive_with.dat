25|$|The onset {{and type}} of {{symptoms}} depends on the radiation exposure. Relatively smaller doses result in gastrointestinal effects, such as nausea and vomiting, and symptoms related to falling blood counts, and predisposition to infection and bleeding. Relatively larger doses can result in neurological effects, including {{but not limited to}} seizures, tremors, lethargy, and rapid death. Treatment of acute radiation syndrome is generally <b>supportive</b> <b>with</b> blood transfusions and antibiotics, with some more aggressive treatments, such as bone marrow transfusions, being required in extreme cases.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms and Treatment: There are few {{reports of}} ACE {{inhibitor}} overdose in the literature. The most likely manifestations are hypotension, {{which may be}} severe, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia and renal impairment with metabolic acidosis. Treatment should be mainly symptomatic and <b>supportive,</b> <b>with</b> volume expansion using normal saline to correct hypotension and improve renal function, and gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal and a cathartic to prevent further absorption of the drug. Captopril, enalapril, lisinopril and perindopril {{are known to be}} removable by hemodialysis.|$|E
40|$|Although {{impression}} management {{scholars have}} {{identified a number of}} tactics for influencing supervisor evaluations, most of those tactics represent supervisor-targeted behaviors. This study examines the degree to which employees form <b>supportive</b> relationships <b>with</b> peers for impression management purposes. In so doing, we explore this intriguing question: Will employees gain more from forming <b>supportive</b> relationships <b>with</b> “stars” (i. e., top performers who are “on the fast track” in the organization) or “projects” (i. e., “works in progress” who need help and refinement to perform well) ? We examined this question in 2 field studies. Study 1 included 4 sources and 2 time periods; Study 2 included 2 sources and 3 time periods. The results showed that <b>supportive</b> relationships <b>with</b> both stars and projects seemed to represent impression management opportunities, insofar as they predicted supervisor positive affect and perceptions of employee promotability. Impression management motives only predicted <b>supportive</b> relationships <b>with</b> stars, however, not projects. Relationships with projects were driven by prosocial motives not concerns about managing images. We discuss the practical and theoretical implications of our results for the managing of impressions and peer relationships...|$|R

2500|$|Wisden's {{verdict on}} Hutton's series {{was that he}} showed mastery of every bowler and stood apart from {{everyone}} else. He also displayed some excellent attacking shots. The correspondent wrote, [...] "From first to last no batsman compared with Hutton ... Considering {{the weight of his}} many responsibilities and worries, Hutton played magnificent cricket..." [...] Many England players later praised Hutton's captaincy and performances on the tour, while the press were generally <b>supportive</b> <b>with</b> a few reservations about his caution. Swanton later wrote that England's recovery to level the series was due to Hutton, who [...] " [...] himself to the furthest point of nervous and physical exhaustion ... If it was not a happy tour, much was redeemed by its ending." [...] In five Tests, he scored 677 runs, his highest in a series, at an average of 96.71, the highest on either side. Alan Gibson describes the tour as [...] "the bravest effort of his career", crediting him for England's recovery from two games down to level the series.|$|E
2500|$|Most fellow {{tennis players}} reacted {{negatively}} to her announcement, {{with almost no}} support or sympathy in general for Sharapova. John McEnroe and Pat Cash said they {{found it hard to}} believe her. Jennifer Capriati posted on Twitter that she should be stripped of her 35 professional titles. Chris Evert expressed her surprise at the lack of support in tennis for Sharapova, noting that she [...] " [...] always isolated herself {{from the rest of the}} tennis world, from the players". Serena Williams expressed surprise at Sharapova’s announcement but commended her for being [...] "upfront with what she had done". Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray all publicly condemned Sharapova and argued that she deserved to be punished on the basis that she failed the doping test, with Murray adding that [...] "Taking a drug you don't necessarily need because it's legal is wrong" [...] and Federer stating that [...] "Whether it's intentional or not, I don't see too much difference. You must be 100 percent about what you are taking". Sharapova's case prompted Federer to urge the tennis federation to conduct more anti-doping tests. Novak Djokovic said that he felt sorry for her, but that she must still be ready for punishment. Victoria Azarenka and Dominika Cibulkova were far less <b>supportive,</b> <b>with</b> Cibulkova adding that she didn't feel sorry at all for Sharapova and didn't miss having her on the tour, describing her as [...] "a totally unlikeable person; arrogant, conceited, and cold". The Russian Tennis Federation strongly defended Sharapova, describing the positive drug test as [...] "nonsense" [...] and adding that they expected Sharapova to be available for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
