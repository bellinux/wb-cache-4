40|$|Background: Feeding {{innovation}} {{occurs when}} individuals choose a novel, unknown type of food and/or acquire new feeding skills. Here we studied feeding innovation and social {{transmission of the}} new feeding habit in canaries. Adult canaries eat {{a wide variety of}} seeds but avoid larger ones such as those of sunflowers. We determined whether adults of both sexes are equally prone to innovate when confronted with sunflower seeds and whether free-interactions facilitate transmission of the new feeding habit in a sex-dependent manner. Methodology/Principal Findings: First we determined which sex was more innovative, i. e., was more successful at husking and eating the novel seeds. Males were clearly more innovative than females. Due to this, experienced males served as model for either male or female observers in three different conditions (<b>free</b> <b>interaction</b> with a demonstrator, visual interaction with a demonstrator placed behind a transparent wall and access to seeds {{in the presence of a}} nondemonstrating bird). During <b>free</b> <b>interactions,</b> the new feeding habit was only transmitted to females. In contrast, transmission of seed handling to male observers only occurred if demonstrator and observer were separated by the transparent wall. Indeed, aggressive behaviors between males prevented social transmission during <b>free</b> <b>interactions.</b> Finally, we studied the influence of the less innovative females in feeding-habit transmission. First, we obtained female demonstrators by making them freely interact with male demonstrators. Once they acquired innovative responses t...|$|R
