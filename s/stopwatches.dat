5|$|The {{finish of}} a race {{is marked by a}} white line 5cm wide. The {{finishing}} position of athletes is determined by the order in which any part of their torso (as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of the nearer edge of the finish line. Fully automatic timing systems (photo timing) {{are becoming more and more}} common at increasingly lower levels of track meets, improving the accuracy, while eliminating the need for eagle-eyed officials on the finish line. Fully automatic timing (FAT) is required for high level meets and any time a (sprint) record is set (though distance records can be accepted if timed by three independent <b>stopwatches).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} reasonably accurate {{estimate of}} the speed of sound in air was made by William Derham, and acknowledged by Isaac Newton. Derham had a telescope {{at the top of the}} tower of the Church of St Laurence in Upminster, England. On a calm day, a synchronized pocket watch would be given to an assistant who would fire a shotgun at a pre-determined time from a conspicuous point some miles away, across the countryside. This could be confirmed by telescope. He then measured the interval between seeing gunsmoke and arrival of the sound using a half-second pendulum. The distance from where the gun was fired was found by triangulation, and simple division (distance/time) provided velocity. Lastly, by making many observations, using a range of different distances, the inaccuracy of the half-second pendulum could be averaged out, giving his final {{estimate of the}} speed of sound. Modern <b>stopwatches</b> enable this method to be used today over distances as short as 200–400 meters, and not needing something as loud as a shotgun.|$|E
25|$|Six {{years of}} war service had never {{permitted}} the formal sea trials to take place so they were now finally undertaken. Under the command of Commodore Sir James Bisset the ship travelled to the Isle of Arran and her trials were carried out. On board was the ship's namesake, Queen Elizabeth, and her two daughters, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. During the trials, Queen Elizabeth took the wheel {{for a brief time}} and the two young princesses recorded the two measured runs with <b>stopwatches</b> that they had been given for the occasion. Bisset was under strict instructions from Sir Percy Bates, who was also aboard the trials, that all that was required from the ship was two measured runs of no more than thirty knots and that she was not permitted to attempt to attain a higher speed record than Queen Mary. Queen Elizabeths engines were capable of driving her to speeds of over 32 knots. After her trials Queen Elizabeth finally entered passenger service, allowing Cunard White Star to launch the long planned two ship weekly service to New York. Despite similar specifications to her older sister ship Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth never held the Blue Riband, for Cunard White Star chairman Sir Percy Bates requested for the two ships not to try to compete against each other.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} <b>stopwatch</b> automata are {{equivalent}} with timed shuffle expressions, {{an extension of}} timed regular expressions with the shuffle operation. Since the emptiness problem is undecidable for <b>stopwatch</b> automata, and hence also for timed shuffle expressions, we introduce a decidable subclass of <b>stopwatch</b> automata called partitioned <b>stopwatch</b> automata. We give for this class an equivalent subclass of timed shuffle expressions and investigate closure properties by showing that partitioned <b>stopwatch</b> automata are closed under union, concatenation, star, shuffle and renaming, but not under intersection. We also show that partitioned <b>stopwatch</b> automata are equivalent with distributed time-asynchronous automata, which are asynchronous compositions of timed automata in which time may evolve independently...|$|R

Although <b>stopwatch</b> method is very effective, this conventional method can only measure speed in a limited measurement point.

500|$|Camp {{was central}} to several more {{significant}} rule changes that came to define American football. In 1881, the field was reduced in size to its modern dimensions of 120 by 53 yards (109.7 by 48.8 meters). Several times in 1883, Camp tinkered with the scoring rules, finally arriving at four points for a touchdown, two points for kicks after touchdowns, two points for safeties, and five for field goals. [...] Camp's innovations {{in the area of}} point scoring influenced rugby union's move to point scoring in 1890. [...] In 1887, game time was set at two halves of 45 minutes each. Also in 1887, two paid officials—a referee and an umpire—were mandated for each game. A year later, the rules were changed to allow tackling below the waist, and in 1889, the officials were given whistles and <b>stopwatches.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Boros {{preferred}} {{to refer to}} himself an advocate of base running: [...] "I've always been a strong advocate of base running, not necessarily base stealing, but base running.

[...] Always {{a student of the}} game, Boros' attitude toward the stolen base had changed by 1986. In an interview that year, Boros said: [...] "The science against stealing has evolved radically in {{the last four or five}} years. That has made it tougher than ever to steal. Pitchers have quicker deliveries, step off and quick pitch, hold the ball. Catchers pitch out much more often. Now you've got pitching coaches with <b>stopwatches</b> timing pitchers' deliveries, while other coaches are timing catchers' throws to second base." ...|$|E
2500|$|The system {{involved}} carefully {{studying a}} target bank for many {{hours before the}} robbery, developing a detailed floor plan, noting the location of safes, taking meticulous notes and establishing escape routes. [...] He would occasionally have a man pose as a journalist {{to better understand the}} inner workings of the bank. [...] Lamm assigned each gang member a specific job, along with a specific zone of the bank they were charged with surveying and a strict timetable to complete their stage of the robbery. Among the jobs he assigned to his fellow robbers were the lookout, the getaway driver, the lobby man and the vault man. He also put his men through a series of rehearsals, some of which involved using a full-scale mock-up of the interior of the bank. Lamm stressed the importance of timing during these practice runs, and used <b>stopwatches</b> to ensure the proper results were achieved. He only allowed his gang members to stay in a bank for a specific period of time, regardless of how much money they could steal.|$|E
