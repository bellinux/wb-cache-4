500|$|On April 1, 1998, the EPB {{published}} {{a press release}} claiming responsibility for {{an attack on a}} facility housing machinery and equipment being used to build the Superaqueduct, one of the Roselló administration's flagship projects. The organization informed that two of its Special Military Units, identified by the names [...] "Manolo el Leñero" [...] and [...] "Francisco Pachín Marín", infiltrated the locale during the previous night. The EPB cited that the government had been working on the project during nighttime, despite the existence of a case in the Appellation Circuit emitted an opinion stating that it lacked proper permits from several agencies including the Department of Natural Resources and that it violated zoning and construction laws, as the justification for their actions. Referring to the Roselló administration as a [...] "political mafia", the organization stated that the government acted [...] "in a dictatorial manner" [...] by [...] "disrespecting the Puerto Rican courts, with no hesitance" [...] and [...] "ignoring the positive and economic alternatives proposed by legitimate defenders of the environment [...] to satisfy the economic interests of private developers." [...] The EPB further argued that the large investment in this and other projects [...] "would end in the pockets of corrupt" [...] individuals, predicting that a portion of it would be used to fund the PNP's political campaign and its lobbyists in Washington. The organization made argued that the environmental damage to the central region and Lago Dos Bocas would be irreparable, also criticizing that the water was only being redirected to the metropolitan area. The group cited local scientists opposed to the Superaqueduct by stating that the effect would also affect Río Grande estuary and the natural reserve of Caño Tiburones in Arecibo, besides offering a subpar quality of water that could endanger the public health. The EPB also expressed concern in the competentcy of those manning the machinery, claiming that it could endanger the safety of children, concluding that these actions formed part of an initiative of [...] "policy of National Salvation" [...] that intended to protect sectors of the general public and workers of entities that the Roselló administration intended to privatize, such as the Puerto Rico Telephone Company. Los Macheteros claimed responsibility for an explosion at a <b>small</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> in the San Juan metropolitan area. The explosion caused limited power outages.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{orthodox}} {{electric power}} distribution systems {{used to be}} generally radial and direction of flow of power was often from grid towards consumer. Sometimes, the transmission of power generated from newly set <b>small</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> by using transmission network is not feasible due to the transmission losses, service cost on transmission lines and other related issues. That is why, in many cases, <b>small</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> are connected directly to the local distribution network. These <b>small</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> inject active and reactive power to the existing network, badly disturbing the flow of power hence injecting harmonics in the system {{at the point of}} common coupling (PCC). This harmonic injection at PCC due to a direct grid-connection of <b>small</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> to the existing large electric power systems is identified. Also, the impact of harmonic incursion by these small generation units is analysed using a straightforward and an effortless method. This simulation based method uses power system components simplified to basic inductive and capacitive elements and can be very helpful for a fast assessment of harmonic incursion at PCC if extended to the practical large inter-connected electric power systems...|$|R

2500|$|The tunnellers {{named the}} {{individual}} quarries after their home towns (Auckland, Wellington, Nelson, Blenheim, Christchurch, Russell and Dunedin for the New Zealanders, and Glasgow, Edinburgh, Crewe and London for the Britons). Assault tunnels were also dug, stopping a few metres {{short of the}} German line, ready to be blown open by explosives {{on the first day}} of the battle. On 4 January 1917, the unit started putting in electricity in the Ronville quarries. Two weeks later, most of the work on the connection tunnels in the Ronville underground system was complete. On 24 January, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company began installing direction signs in the underground system. The next day, they started early works to organise a tramway line into the Ronville and Saint-Sauveur systems. By that time, the tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers had constructed 20kilometres of tunnels, graded as subways (foot traffic only), tramways (with rails for hand-drawn trolleys, for taking ammunition to the line and bringing casualties back from it) and railways (a light railway system). The tunnel system could accommodate 24,000 men and was equipped with running water, electric light, kitchens, latrines, a <b>small</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> and a medical centre with a fully equipped operating theatre. In addition to this, conventional mines were laid under the front lines, ready to be blown immediately before the assault. In the meantime, German sappers were actively conducting their own underground operations, seeking out Allied tunnels to assault and counter-mine. On 14–16 March 1917, the German withdrawal on the Hindenburg Line (Siegfried Stellung) made it impossible to attack from the Ronville system. Despite this setback, electricity was installed and tested in the whole system beneath Arras by 3 April 1917, ready for the start of the Battle of Arras on 9 April. On the first day of the battle, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company opened three tunnels located at the end of Saint-Sauveur system, allowing infantrymen to appear suddenly in the German trenches. Owing to the German withdrawal from their front line south-east of Arras, the unit also fired the only mine that was used on the Arras front on 9 April. It was located to the north-east at Blagny, and was a [...] charge, blown by the New Zealand Tunnelling Company at zero, 5.30 a.m. It destroyed two German dugouts, [...] of trench and a concrete pillbox. However, it also stunned and apparently buried some members of the 13th Royal Scots and impeded their assault temporarily.|$|E
