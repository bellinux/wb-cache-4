Sailing outside the normal shipping lanes to avoid notice, he arrived at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay on August 30, and disembarked the troops to assist in the land blockade of Cornwallis. Two British frigates that were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> patrol outside the bay were trapped inside the bay by de Grasse's arrival; this prevented the British in New York from learning the full strength of de Grasse's fleet until it was too late.|$|E

500|$|The {{second season}} {{begins with the}} {{introduction}} of two new cases: a bus accident that kills several of Veronica's classmates, and the death of PCH biker gang member Felix Toombs. A school bus carrying six Neptune High students and a teacher plunges off a cliff, killing all but one passenger. Veronica, who was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the bus, makes it her mission to discover why the bus crashed and who is responsible. Logan picks a fight with Weevil and the PCHers and ends up accused of killing Felix (a charge he denies). Partway through the season, Weevil becomes convinced of Logan's innocence and they team up to find the real killer. This season shows Veronica's life returning to much the way it had been before Lilly's death: having broken up with Logan during the summer, she reunites with Duncan and is somewhat accepted by the '09ers. However, her private-eye sideline and tough persona keep her from being truly assimilated back into the rich crowd. '09ers Dick Casablancas and Cassidy [...] "Beaver" [...] Casablancas deal with a gold-digging stepmother, Kendall Casablancas, with whom they are left when their father flees the country while under investigation for real estate fraud. Wallace discovers that his biological father is alive, and takes a romantic interest in Jackie Cook, the daughter of baseball legend Terrence Cook who is investigated for the bus accident. Veronica discovers that the town mayor, who years ago coached a little league baseball team, sexually molested several team members, including Cassidy [...] "Beaver" [...] Casablancas. In the finale, it is discovered that Beaver is responsible for the bus accident and Veronica's rape, as well as a plane crash that kills the mayor (Veronica's dad was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the plane, so she thinks he is dead). Veronica confronts Beaver {{on the roof of the}} Neptune Grand hotel, where he tries to kill her. Logan saves her, but Beaver commits suicide by jumping off the roof.|$|E
