40|$|This paper studies content caching in cloud-aided {{wireless}} networks where <b>small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> {{with limited}} storage {{are connected to}} the cloud via limited capacity fronthaul links. By formulating a utility (inverse of service delay) maximization problem, we propose a cache update algorithm based on spatio-temporal traffic demands. To account for the large number of contents, we propose a content clustering algorithm to group similar contents. Subsequently, with the aid of regret learning at <b>small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> and the cloud, each base station caches contents based on the learned content popularity subject to its storage constraints. The performance of the proposed caching algorithm is evaluated for sparse and dense environments while investigating the tradeoff between global and local class popularity.

30|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{explosive}} increase in mobile data traffic demand, heterogeneity {{is expected to}} be a key feature of future wireless networks [1 - 4]. Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) consist of a conventional cellular network overlaid with a diverse set of lower power <b>small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> (BSs), such as microcells, picocells, and femtocells, to improve spatial frequency reuse and coverage. This allows the network to achieve higher data rates while retaining seamless connectivity and mobility. However, the overall energy consumption and operating cost of networks are also increasing considerably by the deployment of these additional <b>small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> [5, 6]. As a result, green wireless communication has attracted the attention of both researchers and network operators, and energy efficiency has become one of the key network management parameters [2, 7]. Additionally, the future heterogeneous networks are also expected to operate in self-organizing manner to reduce operational expenditures (OPEX) due to the deployment of large numbers of BSs [8].|$|E
40|$|Small cells {{constitute}} a promising solution {{for managing the}} mobile data growth that has overwhelmed network operators. Local caching of popular content items at the <b>small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> has been proposed in order to decrease the capacity-and hence the cost- of the backhaul links that connect these base stations with the core network. However, deriving the optimal caching policy remains a challenging open problem especially if one considers realistic parameters such as the bandwidth limitation of the base stations. The latter constraint is particularly important for cases when users requests are massive. We consider such a scenario and formulate the joint caching and routing problem aiming to maximize the fraction of content requests served by the deployed <b>small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations.</b> This is an NP-hard problem and hence we cannot obtain an exact optimal solution. Thus, we present a novel approximation framework based on a reduction to a well known variant of the facility location problem. This allows us to exploit the rich literature in facility location problems, {{in order to establish}} bounded approximation algorithms for our problem. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{distributed}} {{power control}} paradigm is proposed for dense <b>small</b> <b>cell</b> networks co-existing {{with a traditional}} macrocellular network. The power control problem is first modeled as a stochastic game {{and the existence of}} the Nash Equilibrium is proven. Then we extend the formulated stochastic game to a mean field game (MFG) considering a highly dense network. An MFG is a special type of differential game which is ideal for modeling the interactions among a large number of entities. We analyze the performance of two different cost functions for the mean field game formulation. Both of these cost functions are designed using stochastic geometry analysis {{in such a way that}} the cost functions are valid for the MFG setting. A finite difference algorithm is then developed based on the LaxFriedrichs scheme and Lagrange relaxation to solve the corresponding MFG. Each <b>small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>base</b> <b>station</b> can independently execute the proposed algorithm offline, i. e., prior to data transmission. The output of the algorithm shows how each <b>small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>base</b> <b>station</b> should adjust its transmit power in order to minimize the cost over a predefined period of time. Moreover, sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the mean field equilibrium for a generic cost function are also given. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated via numerical results...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} the reassignment of User Equipments (UEs) between adjacent small cells to concurrently enable spatial multiplexing gains through Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) and reductions in energy consumption though switching emptied small cells to a sleep state. We consider {{a case where}} UEs can be reassigned between adjacent small cells provided that the targeted neighbouring cell contains a UE with which the reassigned UE can perform MU-MIMO without experiencing excessive multi-user interference, and whilst achieving a minimum expected gain in spectral efficiency over the previous original cell transmissions as a result. We formulate the selection decision of which UEs to reassign as a set covering problem {{with the objective of}} maximising the number of <b>small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> to switch to a sleep state. Our results show that, for both indoor and outdoor LTE small cell scenarios, the proposed MU-MIMO-based reassignments achieve significant reductions in the required number of active <b>small</b> <b>cell</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations,</b> whilst simultaneously achieving increases in spectral efficiency.

Using multiple antennas, such base stations can improve link reliability and increase spectral efficiency through diversity, beamforming and multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) spatial multiplexing.
