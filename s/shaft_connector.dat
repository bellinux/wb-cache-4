5000|$|On 8 September 1997 Flight 451, a Eurocopter AS 332L1 Super Puma, {{from the}} Norwegian {{helicopter}} operator Helikopter Service, {{crashed into the}} Norwegian Sea, [...] northwest of Brønnøysund, Norway. The aircraft was en route from Brønnøysund Airport, Brønnøy to Norne, an offshore Floating production storage and offloading vessel (FPSO). The accident {{was caused by a}} fatigue crack in a spline of a power transmission <b>shaft</b> <b>connector,</b> which ultimately caused the power transmission shaft to fail. All twelve people on board were killed in the crash.|$|E
40|$|A {{screen for}} protein {{tyrosine}} phosphatases (PTPs) {{expressed in the}} chick inner ear yielded {{a high proportion of}} clones encoding an avian ortholog of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor Q (Ptprq), a receptor-like PTP. Ptprq was first identified as a transcript upregulated in rat kidney in response to glomerular nephritis and has recently been shown to be active against inositol phospholipids. An antibody to the intracellular domain of Ptprq, anti-Ptprq, stains hair bundles in mice and chicks. In the chick ear, the distribution of Ptprq is almost identical to that of the 275 kDa hair-cell antigen (HCA), a component of hair-bundle <b>shaft</b> <b>connectors</b> recognized by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that stains inner-ear hair bundles and kidney glomeruli. Furthermore, anti-Ptprq immunoblots a 275 kDa polypeptide immunoprecipitated by the anti-HCA mAb from the avian inner ear, indicating that the HCA and Ptprq are likely to be the same molecule. In two transgenic mouse strains with different mutations in Ptprq, anti-Ptprq immunoreactivity cannot be detected in the ear. <b>Shaft</b> <b>connectors</b> are absent from mutant vestibular hair bundles, but the stereocilia forming the hair bundle are not splayed, indicating that <b>shaft</b> <b>connectors</b> are not necessary to hold the stereocilia together; however, the mice show rapid postnatal deterioration in cochlear hair-bundle structure, associated with smaller than normal transducer currents with otherwise normal adaptation properties, a progressive loss of basal-coil cochlear hair cells, and deafness. These results reveal that Ptprq is required for formation of the <b>shaft</b> <b>connectors</b> of the hair bundle, the normal maturation of cochlear hair bundles, and the long-term survival of high-frequency auditory hair cells...|$|R
40|$|Ptprq is a receptor-like {{inositol}} lipid phosphatase {{associated with}} the <b>shaft</b> <b>connectors</b> of hair bundles. Three lines of evidence suggest Ptprq is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan: (1) chondroitinase ABC treatment causes a loss of the ruthenium-red reactive, electron-dense particles associated with <b>shaft</b> <b>connectors,</b> (2) chondroitinase ABC causes {{an increase in the}} electrophoretic mobility of Ptprq, and (3) hair bundles in the developing inner ear of wild-type mice, but not those of Ptprq(-/-) mice, react with monoclonal antibody (mAb) 473 -HD, an IgM that recognizes the dermatan-sulfate-dependent epitope DSD 1. Two lines of evidence indicate that there may be multiple isoforms of Ptprq expressed in hair bundles. First, although Ptprq is expressed throughout the lifetime of most hair cells, hair bundles in the mouse and chick inner ear only express the DSD 1 epitope transiently during development. Second, mAb H 10, a novel mAb that recognizes an epitope common to several avian inner-ear proteins including Ptprq, only stains mature hair bundles in the extrastriolar regions of the vestibular maculae. MAb H 10 does not stain mature hair bundles in the striolar regions of the maculae or in the basilar papilla, nor does it stain immature hair bundles in any organ. Three distinct, developmentally regulated isoforms of Ptprq may therefore be expressed on hair bundles of the chick inner ear. Hair bundles in the mature chick ear that do not express the H 10 epitope have longer <b>shaft</b> <b>connectors</b> than those that do, indicating {{the presence or absence of}} the H 10 epitope on Ptprq may modulate the spacing of stereocilia...|$|R
40|$|Up to four link {{types are}} {{found between the}} stereocilia of chick {{vestibular}} hair bundles: tip links, horizontal top <b>connectors,</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>connectors</b> and ankle links. A fifth type, the kinocilial link, couples the hair bundle to the kinocilium. Brownian-motion microinterferometry was used to study the mechanical properties of the hair bundle and investigate changes caused by removing different links with the calcium chelator BAPTA or the protease subtilisin. Immunofluorescence with an antibody to the hair-cell antigen (HCA) and electron microscopy were used to verify destruction of the links. The root mean square displacement and the corresponding absolute stiffness of untreated hair bundles were 4. 3 nm and 0. 9 mN m- 1, respectively. The ratio of Brownian-motion spectra before and after treatment was calculated and processed using a single oscillator model to obtain relative stiffness. Treatment with BAPTA, which cleaves tip, kinocilial and ankle links, reduces hair-bundle stiffness by 43 %, whilst subtilisin treatment, which breaks ankle links and <b>shaft</b> <b>connectors,</b> reduces stiffness by 48 %. No changes were detected in viscous damping following either treatment. The time course of the subtilisin-induced stiffness change was close to that of HCA loss, {{but not to the}} disappearance of the ankle links, suggesting that <b>shaft</b> <b>connectors</b> make a more significant contribution to hair-bundle stiffness. Sequential treatments of the hair bundles with BAPTA and subtilisin show that the effects are additive. The implication of complete additivity is that structures resistant to both agents (e. g. top connectors and stereocilia pivots) are responsible for approximately 9 % of the overall bundle stiffness...|$|R
40|$|Ptprq, a receptor-like {{phosphatase}} {{known to}} be associated with the <b>shaft</b> <b>connectors</b> of stereocilia, is a protein required for the maintenance of the hair-bundle structure. The extracellular domain of Ptprq has numerous potential sites for N-glycosylation and the cytoplasmic domain has phosphatidyl inositol phosphatase activity in vitro. The current project was aimed at determining whether Ptprq regulates inositol phosphate levels in the hair bundle, identifying the intracellular binding partners of Ptprq, understanding what targets Ptprq to the apical membrane, and finally, elucidating whether Ptprq is a proteoglycan. The results show that EHD 3, a protein involved in endocytosis, interacts with the intracellular domain of Ptprq and that a major part of the apical targeting signal in Ptprq lies in the N-glycosylated moieties of the extracellular domain. Also, evidence was found indicating that Ptprq is a chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan and that there may be a developmentally-regulated isoform carrying the DSD- 1 epitope. Glycosylation variants of Ptprq may be responsible for the regional variation in the appearance of the <b>shaft</b> <b>connectors.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The hair {{bundle of}} the {{receptor}} {{cells in the}} paratympanic organ of the chicken was studied by TEM, after fixation in aldehydes/osmium tetroxide or in aldehydes/osmium tetroxide/tannic acid. The bundles are formed by a kinocilium and by 40 - 70 stereocilia. The stereocilia are linked to each other by an extensive network of filaments. Three types of these connectors are present: basal, shaft and apical; the latter consist of side-to-side and tip-to-side connectors. We observed that the <b>shaft</b> <b>connectors</b> are well-highlighted only when tannic acid was used, while the other connectors {{are to be found}} in the conventionally fixed specimens also. The tip-to-side connector consists of a filament which joins the tip of a stereocilium with the side of an adjacent taller stereocilium; we suggest that the distortion of this filament would give rise to the mechanosensory transduction. The other connectors probably serve to maintain the regular spatial arrangement of the hair bundle and the mechanical coupling of the stereocilia. Our study shows that the general conformation of the hair bundle and the stereociliary links of the hair cells in the paratympanic organ of chicken are similar to those previously described in the hair cells of the acoustico lateralis system...|$|R
40|$|Sensory hair bundles in {{the inner}} ear are {{composed}} of stereocilia that can be interconnected {{by a variety of}} different link types, including tip links, horizontal top <b>connectors,</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>connectors,</b> and ankle links. The ankle link antigen is an epitope specifically associated with ankle links and the calycal processes of photoreceptors in chicks. Mass spectrometry and immunoblotting were used to identify this antigen as the avian ortholog of the very large G-protein-coupled receptor VLGR 1, the product of the Usher syndrome USH 2 C (Mass 1) locus. Like ankle links, Vlgr 1 is expressed transiently around the base of developing hair bundles in mice. Ankle links fail to form in the cochleae of mice carrying a targeted mutation in Vlgr 1 (Vlgr 1 /del 7 TM), and the bundles become disorganized just after birth. FM 1 - 43 [N-(3 -triethylammonium) propyl) - 4 -(4 -(dibutylamino) styryl) pyridinium dibromide] dye loading and whole-cell recordings indicate mechanotransduction is impaired in cochlear, but not vestibular, hair cells of early postnatal Vlgr 1 /del 7 TM mutant mice. Auditory brainstem recordings and distortion product measurements indicate that these mice are severely deaf by the third week of life. Hair cells from the basal half of the cochlea are lost in 2 -month-old Vlgr 1 /del 7 TM mice, and retinal function is mildly abnormal in aged mutants. Our results indicate that Vlgr 1 is required for formation of the ankle link complex and the normal development of cochlear hair bundles...|$|R
40|$|An {{automatic}} bone traction device {{includes a}} main body, a distractor (18), a flexible <b>shaft</b> (13) and <b>connectors</b> (9, 11). The main body {{consists of a}} high torque movement mechanism (2) which contains a step motor, a series of transmission gears, a PCB (3) and a button battery (6). The flexible shaft is used to connect the transmission gear assembly and the bone distractor (18) with the connectors (9, 11). And then the generated driving torque is transmitted to the distractor (18) through the flexible shaft (13).

40|$|The {{incidence}} of fractures of the humerus has increased exponentially in recent years. The most used classifications for humerus fracture are morphological (Neer), biological (AO/ASIF) and descriptive (Hertel). The types of surgical treatment for humerus fracture include prosthetic replacement and synthesis using different devices, including the Tension Guide Fixator (TGF), Gex-Fix. External fixation for displaced proximal humeral fractures avoids dissection and soft tissue stripping {{and has been}} reported by some authors {{to be associated with}} higher union rates, a lower {{incidence of}} avascular necrosis, less scarring of the scapulohumeral interface, and faster rehabilitation compared with open reduction and internal fixation. Other authors have reported that external fixation does not ensure acceptable reduction and fracture stability, particularly in patients with osteoporosis. The external fixation technique involves the introduction of Steinmann's pin to keep manual reduction, the introduction of two K-wires in the humeral head, the removal of the Steinmann's pin, and the introduction of two fiches on the humeral <b>shaft.</b> Hub <b>connectors</b> are mounted on the wires and on the chips to connect the outer bar and tensioning system. A total of 84 patients aged 42 - 84 years with proximal end humeral fractures (66 % had two-part fractures) were treated with Fixator TGF in this study from December 2007 to June 2012. The postoperative recovery was earlier and the active-assisted motion was less painful than has been reported with other surgical techniques. The TGF was removed without anaesthesia at the outpatient clinic at a mean of 7 weeks (range 5 - 8 weeks) after surgery, and there was no loss of reduction or secondary displacement after removal. These results, after five years of experience, confirm that the best indication for this fixator is two- or three-part fractures because the device enables early active mobilisation. The limitations of this fixator are evident in fractures in which closed reduction is not possible and in three-part fractures with varus displacement because the TGF has less stability than other systems, such as the plate or cage. The short learning curve, reduced surgical time and risk, and low cost encourage the use of this technique...|$|R
