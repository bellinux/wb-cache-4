25|$|At the Rally d'Italia Sardegna, Loeb had a {{puncture}} {{after going}} {{off the road}} and dropped from third to fourth. Although he passed Petter Solberg for the final podium spot, he still finished fourth due to a time penalty for a <b>safety</b> <b>rule</b> violation; co-driver Daniel Elena had unfastened his safety belts before the crew stopped the car for a tyre change. At the Acropolis Rally, Loeb crashed out from third place. On Rally Poland's return to the WRC, Loeb had another crash but he continued in the event under superally rules. After team orders issued for the Citroën Junior Team drivers and a late mistake by Ford's Jari-Matti Latvala, Loeb found himself seventh but had lost the championship lead to Hirvonen by one point.|$|E
25|$|The current {{process for}} {{evaluating}} the seismic hazard for a nuclear plant is set out in Règle Fondamentale de Sûreté (Fundamental <b>Safety</b> <b>Rule)</b> RFS 2001-01, published by the Institute for Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety, which uses more detailed seismotectonic zones. RFS 2001-01 replaced RFS I.2.c, published in 1981, however it has been criticised for continuing to require a deterministic assessment (rather than a probabilistic approach) that relies primarily on the strongest 'historically known' earthquake near a site. This leads {{to a number of}} problems including the short period (in geological timescales) for which there are records, the difficulty of assessing the characteristics of earthquakes that occurred prior to the use of seismometers, the difficulty of identifying the existence of all earthquakes that pre-date the historic record, and ultimately the reliance on one single earthquake scenario. Other criticisms include the use of intensity in the evaluation method, rather than spectral acceleration, which is commonly used elsewhere.|$|E

We {{extend the}} <b>safety</b> <b>rules</b> {{used for the}} Statistical Disclosure Control of {{magnitude}} tables to include an intruder who models the ignorance about an unknown confidential quantity with a Uniform distribution. By applying this extension to the generalised p-rule we obtain the <b>safety</b> <b>rules</b> useful also {{in the presence of}} groups of respondents. The corresponding disclosure rules for different prior knowledge of the intruder. The different <b>safety</b> <b>rules</b> are then compared to each other by considering some real Structural Business Statistics. ...|$|R

We generalize these rules and show {{how they can}} all be expressed as bounds on the relative error of estimation for partial sums. Thus we relate the Dominance rule to the p-rule and (p, q) -rule. Then we consider <b>safety</b> <b>rules</b> based on a different estimating procedure, showing that these are {{of the same kind}} of the previous ones. These different <b>safety</b> <b>rules</b> are then compared {{to each other and to}} the previous ones...|$|R

2500|$|On 26 July 1930, Bader was {{commissioned}} {{as a pilot}} officer into No. 23 Squadron RAF based at Kenley, Surrey. Flying Gloster Gamecocks and soon after, Bristol Bulldogs, Bader became a daredevil while training there, often flying illegal and dangerous stunts. While very fast for its time, the Bulldog had directional stability problems at low speeds, which made such stunts exceptionally dangerous. Strict orders were issued forbidding unauthorised aerobatics below [...] Douglas took this as an unnecessary <b>safety</b> <b>rule</b> rather than an order to be obeyed. After one training flight at the gunnery range, Bader achieved only a 38 percent hit rate on a target. Receiving jibes from a rival squadron (No. 25 Squadron RAF), Bader took off to perform aerobatics and show off his skill. It was against regulations, and seven out of 23 accidents caused by ignoring regulations had proven fatal. The CO of No. 25 Squadron remarked that he would order Bader to face a court-martial if Bader was in his unit. The COs of Bader's unit, Harry Day and Henry Wollett, gave the pilots more latitude, although Day encouraged them to recognise their own limits.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2010, the European {{railway network}} was opened to a {{liberalisation}} intended to allow greater competition. Both Air France-KLM and Deutsche Bahn have indicated {{their desire to}} take advantage of the new laws to run new services via the Channel Tunnel and the High Speed 1 route that terminates at London St Pancras. [...] A test run of an ICE train through the Channel Tunnel took place on 19 October 2010. Passenger-carrying ICE trains, however, will have to meet safety requirements in order to transit the Channel Tunnel. Although the requirement for splittable trains was lifted, concerns remain over the shorter length of ICE trainsets, fire safety, and the ICE's distributed power arrangements. There have been suggestions that French interests have advocated stringent enforcement to delay a competitor on the route. Eurostar also recently chose Siemens Velaro-based rolling stock; there were concerns that Alstom (builders of the passenger trains that already use the Tunnel) and the French Government would take the matter to court. In October 2010, the French transport minister suggested that the European Railway Agency (based in France) should arbitrate. After <b>safety</b> <b>rule</b> changes which might permit the use of Siemens Velaro rolling stock, the French government dismissed their delegate to the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority, and brought in a replacement.|$|E
2500|$|Outside {{of these}} requirements, teams may design {{the car and}} place sponsor logos in NASCAR-approved locations, and must submit all paint and {{graphics}} schemes and all sponsor identity to NASCAR in advance for approval. One paint scheme requirement for example is that both the driver and passenger {{side of the car}} must share the same color pattern, though the front and rear may be different colors. This <b>safety</b> <b>rule,</b> to avoid confusion for spotters, NASCAR officials, and other drivers, was brought into light in October 2014 at Talladega, when Terry Labonte's Go FAS Racing team painted his [...] 32 car in two different color schemes as a tribute to the two-time champion, but prior to NASCAR approval. NASCAR allowed the team to retain the scheme for knock-out qualifying, but forced them to match the two sides for the race. However, by 2016, it seems that NASCAR has either quietly removed this rule or allowed teams to race with a split-side scheme as long as they got the permission to do so, as seen with John Hunter Nemechek's [...] 8 truck in the 2016 American Ethanol E15 225 and both the [...] 3 and [...] 31 cars of RDV Compétition during the 2016 NASCAR Whelen Euro Series.|$|E
