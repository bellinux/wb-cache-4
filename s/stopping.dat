One of these came from Rickmansworth and another from Harrow, the rest started at Willesden Green. There was also a train every two hours from Verney Junction, which stopped at all {{stations}} to Harrow, then Willesden Green and Baker Street. The timetable was arranged so that the fast train would leave Willesden Green just before a <b>stopping</b> service and arrived at Baker Street just behind the previous service.|$|E

5|$|At its widest aperture, the {{sharpness}} {{does not}} meet the 1800 threshold at either 8mm (1572, f/4.5) or 12mm (1356, f/5), but at 16mm (f/5.6) it achieves over 2000 lines per picture height. However, <b>stopping</b> down improves the sharpness at all focal lengths, according to PC Magazine. At 8mm, 1800 is reached at f/8, while at 12mm it is still only at 1509 by f/8. The image quality is asymmetric with better performance on the right side. At 8mm and f/4.5, it has 1 blur unit in the center and 1.5 in the corners. Although the images are slightly sharper at f/5.6, SLR Gear claims sharpness declines significantly at f/11 to almost 2 blur units with further <b>stopping</b> down increasing blur to 3.5 at f/22. At the longer focal lengths for this lens, <b>stopping</b> down to f/29 yields a 5 blur unit result.|$|E

After arriving in Mexico in March 1908, the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice.

40|$|Trajectory <b>stops</b> imply {{important}} semantic information, and {{the extraction}} of trajectory <b>stops</b> is the premise to carry out advanced Stop/Move analysis. This paper, {{based on the idea}} of kernel density, firstly introduces the concept of <b>stop</b> index, which is derived by cumulating spatio-temporal contribution of neighboring points, and further designs <b>stop</b> index graph to intuitively visualize the evolution of spatio-clustering degree during a trajectory. Importantly, <b>stops</b> index and its graph are related to spatial scale through neighboring radius, which then can be exploited to analyze trajectory <b>stops</b> under multiple scales. In addition, this paper introduces <b>stop</b> sequence rooted from <b>stop</b> index, and proposes an algorithm for the automatic extraction of trajectory <b>stops</b> by progressively merging <b>stop</b> sequences. According to the algorithm, a <b>stop</b> under strong GPS signal exactly corresponds to a <b>stop</b> sequence, while a <b>stop</b> under weak GPS signal could be derived by merging multiple <b>stop</b> sequences. Experiments based on own-acquired and GeoLife trajectories show that the algorithm has achieves the balance between the completeness and accuracy of <b>stop</b> extraction, and could effectively discover and extract complex and diverse trajectory <b>stops.</b> Even facing trajectories with serious drift noises, the algorithm still achieves a high rate of accuracy on <b>stop</b> extraction...|$|R
