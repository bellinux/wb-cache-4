50|$|The {{foundation}} of Schauman's paper-and-pulp operations was laid {{with the construction}} of a sulfite pulp mill in Jakobstad in 1934. In the early 1960s, a <b>sulfate</b> <b>pulp</b> mill, a paper mill, and a paper sack plant were added. During {{the first half of the}} 1970s, major investments were made in pulp manufacturing, and this made Schauman the largest producer of market pulp in Finland. The paper sack plant in Jakobstad soon became the largest of its kind in Finland, and in 1969 Schauman purchased the Craf'Sac plant in Rouen, France. Schauman had already become a world leader in plywood product development by the beginning of the 1960s, grabbing additional market share through the use of new and innovative production methods for gluing, coating and processing of plywood, as well as through the use of spruce as raw material.|$|E
50|$|Hällefors {{used to be}} {{the seat}} of Hellefors Bruks AB, which in the early 20th century was one of the largest {{manufacturing}} companies in central Sweden. It produced iron and steel, mechanical wood pulp, sulfite and <b>sulfate</b> <b>pulp,</b> sawn timber, joinery and box boards. It mined, for its own requirements and for sale, ore from its own iron ore fields. At a large number of its own power stations, situated on Svartälven and its tributaries, the company produced electrical energy which was widely distributed to its own works and outside customers. The company also grew timber on a large scale, and an extensive private railway system runs right through the company's forests which cover several hundred thousand acres in Hällefors and surrounding municipalities. The general management of the company was at Hällefors, where the company operated ironworks, a wood-grinding mill, a sawmill, a box factory and joinery works.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{chemical}} pulping {{is used to}} chemically disband the lignin found in the cell walls of the material undergoing the process. After the cellulose fibers are separated from the lignin, a pulp is created which can then be treated to create durable paper, boxes, and corrugated cardboard. Chemical pulping can be characterized by two main methods: <b>sulfate</b> (Kraft process) <b>pulping</b> and sulfite pulping, and these two methods have different benefits. <b>Sulfate</b> <b>pulping</b> can be performed {{on a wide range}} of tree varieties and results in the creation of a strong type of paper. Conversely, sulfite pulping results in a higher volume of pulp which is easier to bleach and process. However, <b>sulfate</b> <b>pulping</b> is more widely used since the product is more durable and the chemicals used in the process can be recovered, thus resulting in minimal environmental pollution.|$|R

40|$|Pulping is {{the term}} used for the process which {{separates}} wood fibers. Chemical pulping, dissolving the lignin in the wood to create a pulp, is {{the most commonly used}} pulping process. Chemical pulping creates higher sheet strength than mechanical pulping; however, yields 40 to 50 percent pulp, where mechanical pulping yields 95 percent pulp. The two main types of chemical pulping are the more common <b>sulfate</b> <b>pulping</b> (most commonly known as Kraft pulping) and sulfite pulping. Kraft pulping accommodates a variety of tree species, recovers and reuses all pulping chemicals, and creates a paper with a higher sheet strength. Sulfite pulp, however, is easier to bleach, yields more bleached pulp, and is easier to refine for papermaking. The major difference between the two types of chemical pulping is the types of chemicals used to dissolve the lignin. This report will focus mainly on these two types of chemical pulping and bleach plants. Pulp mills are one of the largest emission sources in Washington and a large toxic pollutant emission producer. There are eight pulp mills in Washington: six Kraft (sulfate) mills and two sulfite mills (one sulfite mill has recently closed). EPA formally adopted MACT in April 1998 for certain pulping processes. Sources will have between 3 and 8 years to come into compliance with the provisions of the MACT. Emissions estimations made after MACT has become effective should be sure to take emissions limitations due to MACT into account. The MACT provisions are found in Part 63, Subpart S, sections 63. 440 - 63. 459 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

Three different pulp samples were investigated: • Pulp sample 1 – unbleached sulphate pulp after cooking: • Pulp sample 2 – sulphate pulp after the first bleaching stage (hydrogen peroxide in acid medium as a bleaching agent) : • Pulp sample 3 – sulphate pulp after the second bleaching stage (hydrogen peroxide in alkali medium as a bleaching agent). Sample 1 came directly from “Mondi Syktyvkar”, samples 2 and 3 were produced in the laboratory of Chemical Department, Syktyvkar Forest Institute. The pulp samples were further analyzed by different methods: extractive substances content were determined, aldehyde groups content was found by a photocolorimetric method, Kappa number was determined by permanganate index, and finally electron microscopy of the three samples was done. Further, residual lignin extraction from sulphate pulp was conducted, and the lignin samples obtained were conducted by ÑÍ 3 ÑÎÎÍ-Í 2 Î – ZnCl 2 blend. Extracted residual lignin was estimated by Komarov’s method, the amount of carboxyl groups in lignin was determined by potentiometry method, lignin molecular weight was calculated by cryoscopy method. Finally, infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy methods were used to analyze extracted lignin spectrum. During the bleaching process, the lignin content of the pulp decreased from 16 to 9 Kappa units. Also, {{a reduction in the}} amount of aldehyde group was observed after the second bleaching stage compared to the first stage. Komarov’s method showed that residual lignin content decreased from 6 to 4 % for unbleached and bleached pulp (after I bleaching stage) respectively. The molecular weight of residual lignin, extracted from unbleached sulphate pulp, is higher than the one from bleached pulp. Spectroscopy methods showed that the residual lignin is composed of guaiacyl and syringal structures, typical for hardwood pulp lignin. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

At the same time the waste liquor is divided into two layers: the upper organic solvent layer and the lower aqueous layer to which has moved the bulk of soluble minerals and organic substances from plant raw material (lignin, hemicelluloses, and extractives). The use of potassium and nitrogen compounds in the cooking liquor allows the use of waste liquor in the manufacture of fertilizers. Previously, we have also obtained nanofibrillated cellulose (CNF) from the air-dry-bleached softwood <b>sulfate</b> <b>pulp</b> with the use of mechanochemical treatment [28]. Mechanochemical treatment was performed {{with the use of a}} milling equipment common for pulp and paper industry. In this research, to reduce energy consumption for preparation of nanocellulose, we used organosolv straw pulp (OSP) which was never dried after cooking and bleaching. Never-dried cellulose is better than once-dried samples because the latter are known to irreversibly lose surface accessibility as a result of drying. Using of never-dried cellulose does not require consumption of energy for drying and grinding since dried cellulose fibers lose the ability to swell and percolate due to irreversible cornification. The application of wet cellulose enables better percolation of acid into cellulose fibers.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, I explore two {{questions}} related to revisionist views of environmental regulations and trade. First, I explore the implications of more stringent standards when these standards both benefit and cost producers and consumers. Second, I empirically explore the impact of one major US environmental policy change in the {{pulp and paper industry}} on productivity and trade. ^ In Part One, I discuss how a stricter labeling standard affects consumer welfare when the labeled goods markets in two countries are integrated, and how a bilateral tariff rate reduction affects consumer welfare. I discuss each issue under two different international trade models: a national product differentiation model and a monopolistic competition model. Different trade models do yield different results. ^ The second question is related to the promulgation of the 2 ̆ 2 cluster rule 2 ̆ 2 for the US pulp and paper industry, implemented by the US Environmental Protection Agency in 1998. This stricter environmental regulation required US pulp and paper producers to invest large amounts of capital to bring themselves into compliance. ^ I use data from five major categories of the US pulp and paper industry [...] -newsprint, paperboard, printing and writing paper, <b>sulfate</b> <b>pulp,</b> and Kraft paper [...] -to investigate if the change induced by the cluster rule improved the productivity of producers and impacted trade flows between the US and Canada. ^ The empirical results show that the impact of the cluster rule on the US domestic sales price and the export price to Canada is negative and significant for the paperboard, printing and writing paper, and Kraft paper industries. ^ The US cluster rule increased Canadian imports of US paperboard, printing and writing paper, and Kraft paper products. However, the value of Canadian imports from the US increased only for paperboard and Kraft paper products, while the value decreased for printing and writing paper products because the own-price elasticity of import demand from the US to Canada is less than one for that industry. For US imports from Canada, the cluster rule decreased the value of trade flows in printing and writing paper and Kraft paper products. ...|$|E
40|$|Displacement washing is an {{operation}} {{in which it}} is possible to wash solid-phase particles with a minimum of water. In a <b>sulfate</b> <b>pulp</b> mill, the main application is the pulp washing, but lime mud washing also occurs in the chemical recovery. The washing consumes a great deal of water. For environmental reasons there is an interest in increasing closure of the liquor systems. This means that excess water is a ballast which has to be pumped around or evaporated, and the water consumption should be kept as low as possible. It also means that non-process elements (NPE), will accumulate in the system and reach levels which may be harmful, e. g. in the bleaching operation. In order to handle the NPE problem, one important factor is the knowledge of how to make an effective separation in the pulp washing operation. Another crucial washing operation is that of lime mud, since it also influences the lime kiln operation and, later on, the quality of the white liquor produced. Hence, a knowledge of the phenomena that govern the displacement washing operation is crucial for the pulping industry to be able to meet the demands in an economically feasible way. Better knowledge of the phenomena also means more accurate models. The pulp fibre and the lime mud are examples of completely different solids, which lead to different conditions in the displacement washing operation. They are therefore suitable both to illustrate aspects of the displacement washing, and for examining conditions in general. In this thesis, studies on both lime mud and pulp are presented. Due to the great differences between the two solid phases studied, there are different phenomena that dominate the displacement washing operation. While lime mud particles form relatively homogeneous beds having small to moderate interactions with the stationary phase, the pulp fibres form more heterogeneous beds having complex stationary phase interactions, regarding both stagnant liquor and the actual fibre. In the lime mud study the dispersion model was found to give good agreement with experimental data, except for a small tailing {{at the end of the}} breakthrough curve. This could be improved by adding a disturbance term to the inlet boundary condition. No effect of pore diffusion could be seen, due to the small size of the particles, whereas there was a noticeable sorption effect. The dispersion coefficient was higher than for more ideally formed particles, and it depended on the type of salt in the solution. This is probably due to pH variations causing changes in the bed structure. The linear adsorption coefficient results were not quite satisfactory, but still showed some dependence on lime mud type and salt type. For pulp fibres, the study of the sorption of metal ions showed that the general sorption behaviour for mono- and divalent ions can be described with a Langmuir isotherm. The Langmuir isotherm could also be used for multi-ion solutions, when adding the influence of the charges on the fibre and the second power of the charges in the solution. The sorption was found to be slightly temperature-dependent. The sorption of ion pairs could be described by separation factors, showing a preference for divalent ions over monovalent ions on the fibre. The separation factors showed that the Mn 2 + ions, which are harmful in modern bleaching, were more strongly bound than Mg 2 +, which is more preferable for the bleaching operation. This study of lignin diffusion out of the fibre wall showed that it could be divided into a short time diffusion and a long time diffusion. The difference is probably due to that the outer layers of the fibre wall have a more open structure than the inner layers, yielding a higher diffusivity during the time these layers are emptied. The short time diffusion is the dominant part for the times used in pulp washing. The increase in diffusivity due to temperature is more rapid above 80 - 90 °C...|$|E

When deionized water was used in the handsheet-making process, aluminum contents in the handsheets had a plateau level of 0.7 mg/g in the range of 1 %– 8 % Al 2 (SO 4) 3 addition levels on dry weight of pulp. On the other hand, when tap water was used aluminum contents increased up to 5.6 mg/g, increasing the Al 2 (SO 4) 3 addition levels to 8 %. The high aluminum contents in the handsheets are explained in terms of pH and the presence of calcium ions from the tap water used. Cationic aluminum species, which are formed from aluminum <b>sulfate</b> added to <b>pulp</b> suspensions, are primarily adsorbed on pulp fibers by electrostatic interactions with carboxyl groups in the pulp, competing with OH− ions in water. These aluminum components, once adsorbed on pulp fibers by ionic interactions, are not removed from the fibers by extending the stirring time of the pulp suspensions.|$|R

The increasing complexity of work affects the proportion of physical to mental effort which workers spend {{in the performance of}} their jobs. Traditional work measurement techniques which are primarily designed to measure the individual's physical load have to be complemented with other techniques to evaluate his mental load. This study is aimed at developing a methodology which {{can be applied to the}} analysis and measurement of the mental contribution of workers and its associated effects. Information Theory and the Theory of Communication are used to provide a conceptual framework in which information processes employed in the performance of industrial tasks are identified and evaluated. Depending on their complexity, the various information processes called mental therbligs, are classified according to four levels of integrative behavior. Information processing rates are calculated on the basis of the amount of information transmitted in the performance of these therbligs. Average and, where possible, peak rates are obtained for typical jobs representing two or more technological levels in four different segments of the forest products industry: a. Lumber Sorting b.

40|$|One of {{the mining}} industry’s main {{concerns}} is {{the management of}} waste rock and tailings generated by sulfide ore extraction. Upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen, iron sulfides oxidize producing acidity. In the absence of alkaline minerals to neutralize this acidity, elements including harmful heavy metals may be transported with percolated water, forming acid mine drainage (AMD). A common solution to prevent oxygen and water entering sulfide-bearing mine waste, thereby minimizing the formation of AMD, is to construct a dry cover comprised of soil. In Sweden, clayey till is often used. Due to a shortage of fine-grained till close to mines, other sealant materials must be considered.

The objective was to evaluate the suitability of GLD for use in sealing layers for sulfidic mine waste. This was carried out by analyzing samples both in the laboratory and in the field in a pilot-scale study. GLD was characterized physically, mineralogically and chemically to determine variations in the properties of the material. Based on the characterization results, the difference between batches was small both mineralogically and physically. In addition, it had favorable qualities with respect to reducing water percolation and oxygen diffusion, as it exhibited low hydraulic conductivity and high water retention potential. However, the shear strength was insufficient for cover applications. In an attempt to improve shear strength, but also {{to reduce the amount of}} GLD to save transportation costs, fly ash, tailings and till were blended with GLD. All of these additives increased the shear strength. Humidity cell tests were used to study the effect of GLD on the mobility of elements found in the tailings that are considered to cause major environmental issues. They showed that the alkaline capacity of the GLD raised the pH, thereby stabilizing the tailings and reducing the leaching of Zn, Cd, Cu, Ni, Co and Cr. The amount of leached elements could be directly related to pH. Mo and As leaching increased as a result of the application of GLD. This is explained by the chemical behavior of these elements and their tendency to become mobile at high pH. Because covers on mine waste should be efficient over the long-term, the aging of GLD was studied with material ranging from 0 - 13 years old. Aged GLD showed a hydraulic conductivity of 10 - 8 m/s. This is not expected to affect the function of the sealing layer to minimize oxidation because older GLD exhibited a high water retention capacity and a degree of water saturation of > 91 %, which would effectively limit oxygen diffusion. Leaching, mainly of S and K, was observed but had no major effect on the hydraulic properties of the material. The effects of aging are largely related to the quantity of water passing through the GLD, thereby changing its chemical composition and, in the long term, its pH. An implementation study using GLD as an additive to improve the hydraulic properties of till in the construction of sealing layers in a cover system design was carried out. The results showed that the quality of till, i. e., hydraulic conductivity and water retention capacity, could be improved by the addition of GLD. Addition of 10 % GLD was found to be sufficient to take full advantage of its hydraulic properties and sufficient compaction could be achieved. Based on the results, GLD is expected to be a viable alternative to traditional cover materials. The pilot-scale study, as well as a full-scale trial that is currently in progress, will be used to evaluate further the function of a GLD-based sealing layer.

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} the clinical, radiographic and histologic healing response of experimentally induced furcal perforations in dogs' teeth contaminated with saliva and repaired with MTA {{with or without}} artificial f 1 oor (calcium sulfate). Results were compared to amalgam. Methodology: Seventy-two mandibular and maxillary premolar teeth of 9 beagle's dogs were used. The pulp extirpation was done, the root canals were cleaned and filled with gutta-percha and AH 26 under aseptic condition. Furcal perforations were created in 66 teeth using round bur # 4. The perforations were left open to salivary contamination for 4 weeks. The teeth were randomly divided into 6 experimental groups. Group 1 (6 teeth) without perforations served as negative controls, group 2 (6 teeth) with perforation served as positive control, group 3 (15 teeth) the perforations were repaired with MTA alone, and group 4 (15 teeth) with calcium sulfate under MTA, group 5 (15 teeth) the perforations were repaired with amalgam alone, and group 6 (15 teeth) with calcium <b>sulfate</b> under amalgam. <b>Pulp</b> chambers of all experimental teeth were filled with same material used to repair the perforation. Clinical and radiographic examinations were done before and after repair. Animals were sacrificed after 4 months. The teeth and the surrounding structure were processed for light microscopic examination. Results: The clinical, radiographic, and histological findings showed that the MTA alone has better success rate {{compared to the other}} groups. Conclusions: The use of calcium sulfate as an internal matrix under MTA or amalgam for repair of delayed furcal perforation did prevent material extrusion but did not enhance the healing process.
