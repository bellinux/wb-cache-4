The energy absorbing system has frusto-conical diaphragm elements frictionally engaging the shaft and are opposed by a force regulating set of disc springs. In principle, this force feedback mechanism serves to keep the stroking load at a reasonable level even if the friction coefficient increases greatly. This force feedback device also serves to desensitize the singular and combined effects of manufacturing tolerances, sliding surface wear, temperature changes, dynamic effects, and lubricity...|$|E

40|$|Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is {{a system}} that {{maintains}} driver-selected speed and headway to a preceding vehicle. The system presents some limitations that are, in part or totally, unknown to the users. Hence, many drivers exhibit a rudimentary mental model of the system and place excessive trust in the device. As a consequence, negative effects on road safety can easily occur. However, to date, many studies conducted on ACC have comprised participants who had never used ACC previously. Therefore, there is limited knowledge of how ACC affects the driving performance of experienced users of the system. To shed light on this point, twenty-six participants, divided into two groups (ACC users and non-users) drove twice in the simulated environment (once with the ACC and once manually). During both drives, the participants experienced a critical situation (<b>stationary</b> vehicle <b>stopped</b> in the cruising lane of the highway). The results show that negative behavioural adaptations to the ACC resulted from the usage of the system with regard to the critical situation: the risk of collision during the driving with ACC was increased compared with the manual driving for both groups of drivers. Besides, the research stresses the negative large correlation between the driver’s mental model of ACC operation in the critical situation and the safety margins maintained by the ACC users during the same situation. Finally, {{it was found that the}} drivers’ trust in the system does not have an influence on the drivers’ behaviour during the trial with the ACC...|$|R

In 1982-1995 there were 10 fatalities of the pedestrians, mostly when a pedestrian stepped into the street without noticing the approaching tram, very often against red traffic light. Another common accident was a pedestrian crossing the street {{so close to the}} front of a stationary tram that he was not observed by the driver. 30% of collisions with cars happened with <b>stationary</b> cars <b>stopped</b> or parked too close to the tram tracks. 10% of collisions happened between trams and buses, and remaining 60% of collisions happened mostly with moving cars. This report analyzed 200 accident reports. It was recognized {{that more than half of}} the collisions between tram and car were caused by errors by the car driver only. 25% of the accidents were caused due to an error by tram driver. 25% of the accidents were caused by more complex causal patterns. About 2/3 of pedestrian accidents were caused by errors of the pedestrian only, tram driver error was very seldom the main cause. For passengers falling in the tram, errors by other road users were an important causal factor, necessitating the heavy braking of the tram. In addition, fewer accidents seemed to happen with older tram drivers and on tracks segregated from other traffic.|$|R

The proposed iterative approach is a stochastic extension of the kNN density-based clustering (KNNCLUST) method which randomly assigns objects to clusters by sampling a posterior class label distribution. In our approach, contextual class-conditional distributions are estimated based on a k nearestneighbors graph, and are iteratively modiﬁed to account for current cluster labeling. Posterior probabilities are also slightly reinforced to accelerate convergence to a <b>stationary</b> labeling. A <b>stopping</b> criterion based on the measure of clustering entropy is deﬁned thanks to the Kozachenko-Leonenko differential entropy estimator, computed from current class-conditional entropies. One major advantage of our approach relies in its ability to provide an estimate of the number of clusters present in the data set. The application of our approach to the clustering of real hyperspectral image data is considered.

Grandfather Libero and Enrica are now <b>stationary</b> in Rome, <b>stop</b> {{traveling}} between the capital and the farmhouse in Puglia, and with the helpof Ave manage family affairs. New characters are ready to animate the villa of Poggio Fiorito: this is Lorenzo Martini, granddaughter of Grandfather Libero (son of the Italian-American brother of Libero Achille as well as Lele's cousin) arriving from New York and Sara Levi, sister of Marco and Sister-in-law of Mary. The first is a famous surgeon, returning to Rome to recover the relationship with former wife Veronica and teenage teenager Tommy of 15 years. The second is a famous athlete, coming also from the United States (where he had gone for an important race) to marry in Rome. Fate has it that the two boys meet on the plane and who, for various vicissitudes that much innervosiranno the young Martini, are found to travel in the same car to Rome, where both are headed. Precisely thanks to that encounter, Sara understands that she is not really in love with the man he is about to marry, leaving him on the altar. The two later discovered they were roommates and with time they began to become confident, until the arrival of the passion. In the life of Sarah, however, Stefano, a fascinating boyfriend who helps her in the management of the open bar replacing the Pittaluga chocolate, comes in, and Veronica continues to undermine the happiness of her ex-husband. Sara also suffers from a congenital malformation of the heart and it is Lorenzo operate on her for saving her life, after putting aside his fear of work (he had a shock in the days when he worked in America). Sara and Lorenzo eventually get married. With the arrival of Lorenzo at home Martini also comes his son Tommy that triggers quite a few jealousies between Elena Martini (now fifteen) and Giada, fifteen Albanian girl who lived on the street and that Mary decides to help and entertain at home Martini. Giada arrived in Italy to find her mother and her brother, whom she had no news for a year. It ends up in the clutches of two baldness that force her to steal while having information about her family. With the help of Martini, the young man succeeds in getting out of this situation, but discovers that the mother is dead and that her brother has been adopted. Jade, in spite of the love that binds him to Tommy, prefers to move to Udine along with the family of the rediscovered brother. Anna, and Emiliano are in crisis: the girl in fact met in London with Kevin for which she lost her head, and Emiliano after being left, begins to have drug problems. After several wrongs and misunderstandings, love returns between this two. Meantime, Maria, after discovering with such joy that she is pregnant with two twins, decides with her husband Marco, to move to Turin where both have found important business opportunities. His sons Palù and Jonathan initially live with grandmother Ave and grandfathers in Rome, then move to Turin with their parents.|$|R
40|$|Road {{accidents}} {{have and}} will remain a major concern as cities around the world continue to grow. The safety problem is likely to worsen as population growth is accompanied by increased travel. For many cities, these trends {{have led to a}} greater provision of public transport as private vehicles become a less viable mode of transport. With the rise in public transport travel, {{it comes as no surprise}} that road management agencies are turning to an increased application of priority measures to improve the travel experience for commuters. For buses, the provision of priority measures has typically been justified based on travel time savings and operational benefits. Although recent years have seen the advances in research valuing the wider ridership, mode shift and environmental benefits of bus priority schemes, including the network wide benefits, a major issue that has yet to be considered in bus priority planning is the road safety impacts of providing priority schemes. This thesis therefore aims to develop an in-depth understanding of the road safety implications of implementing bus priority through an investigation of accident records and conflicts in Metropolitan Melbourne. It is structured around six approaches that had been established to fill the knowledge in the area of bus priority safety effects. Each approach is the focus of a thesis chapter where the research context is discussed before the research methodology is presented. Results and key findings that emerged from subsequent analyses were used as a basis to understand the implications of implementing bus priority in the context of bus priority planning and research. The first approach concerns an exploration of the safety effects of bus priority at the aggregate level. Here, a before-after safety evaluation of both “space based” and “time based” bus priority was carried out to understand its effects at the network and bus route levels. A before-after accident type analysis was done to examine whether accident counts or nature of accidents had changed following the implementation of bus priority. Results of the safety evaluation based on the Empirical Bayes approach showed that the implementation of bus priority treatments led to a 14 % reduction in accidents. “Space based” treatments (mainly bus lanes) yielded a stronger positive safety effect (18. 2 %) compared to “time based” ones (11. 1 %). In terms of fatal and serious injury accidents, a drop of 42 to 29 per annum was recorded. Given that different design types are available in before-after safety evaluation, the second approach focuses on understanding how the choice of comparison group type affected the bus priority safety estimate. Using the Empirical Bayes (EB) and Comparison Group (CG) approaches, it was found that the effect of using different comparison group types led to discrepancies in the final safety estimates. It is likely that these differences were due to the (necessary) omission of sites with zero accident history and effect of matching treatment sites with similar sites in the CG approach. A new approach that combined both EB and CG results showed promise as a more precise safety estimate was obtained. The third approach relates to an investigation of bus accidents at the route level. Using two mainstream modelling methodologies (MENB - Mixed Effects Negative Binomial and BPNN – Back Propagation Neural Network modelling), risks factors in bus accidents were explored with particular attention paid to the safety effect of bus priority. Results showed that bus priority led to lower occurrence for certain accidents types. The MENB and BPNN model results showed that bus priority had the effect of reducing route section level accident frequency by about 53. 5 %. The MENB model recorded better performance which pointed to benefits in adopting the MENB approach to account for time- and location-specific effects in accident count modelling. The fourth approach concerns the analysis of bus accidents in terms of vehicle, driver, roadway and environmental factors. This was done to identify the significant risk factors in a bus company database of accidents where bus drivers were deemed to be at-fault. Similar to the third approach, the aim was to understand the effect of bus priority on drivers’ at-fault probability in bus-involved accidents. Results from mixed logit modelling showed that bus length / age, driver’s gender / age / experience / accident record, road type, speed limit, traffic / daylight conditions, and the presence of bus priority affect the likelihood of bus drivers being at-fault in bus-involved accidents. For bus priority, the effect was found to be random as bus priority only reduced the at-fault likelihood for some 57. 8 % of drivers. The fifth approach centres on an investigation of the bus priority effect (bus lanes) at a corridor-level through micro-simulation. The focus was on conflicts at intersections and bus stops as the introduction of bus lanes was expected to have most impact on traffic movements at these locations. Results showed that the provision of bus lanes, regardless of whether they are created through space reallocation or creation, lead to a reduction in conflicts at intersections and bus stop locations. These pointed to lower rear-end and lane change accident risks for vehicles when bus lanes are in place. The sixth approach concerns an estimation of crash risk for vehicles that are behind a slowing or stationary bus at a bus stop in a mixed traffic configuration. This was done to quantify the safety benefit delivered by bus priority schemes that segregate buses from mainstream traffic. Using recorded travel behaviour and accident history of a representative road corridor, the average crash risk of vehicles that were in conflict with buses was found to be 0. 0154 % (with a standard error of 0. 0063 %). Based on the assumption of an average of thirty such conflicts occurring daily, it works out that there is an approximate 80 % chance of one or more accidents taking place annually as a result of buses slowing down or being <b>stationary</b> at bus <b>stops.</b> Overall the thesis presents a range of advances in knowledge in the area of bus priority. Through the six approaches, new light has been shed on the safety effects of bus priority. The thesis concludes with a synthesis of the findings, in which its implications in the context of bus priority research and planning as well as opportunities for future research are presented...|$|R
