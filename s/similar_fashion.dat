The magnetic field detected around Ganymede is likely to be caused by compositional convection in the core, if the magnetic field is the product of dynamo action, or magnetoconvection.|$|E

5|$|BZP {{has been}} shown to have a mixed {{mechanism}} of action, acting on the serotonergic and dopaminergic receptor systems in a <b>similar</b> <b>fashion</b> to MDMA. BZP has amphetamine-like actions on the serotonin reuptake transporter, which increase serotonin concentrations in the extracellular fluids surrounding the cell and thereby increasing activation of the surrounding serotonin receptors. BZP has a lower potency effect on the noradrenaline reuptake transporter and the dopamine reuptake transporter. BZP has a high affinity action at the alpha2-adrenoreceptor, it is an antagonist at the receptor, like yohimbine, which inhibits negative feedback, causing an increase in released noradrenaline.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, the {{construction}} of war cemeteries, graves and their associated memorials were typically placed {{under the control of}} a central state authority. The Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) took on this role for Britain and her empire. The Commissione nazionale per la onoranze ai caduti di guerra in Italy coordinated the military repatriation of bodies and {{the construction}} of cemeteries. The German war graves commission, the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge (VDK), was established in 1919, and took strict control over the creation and style of German war cemeteries. The American Battle Monuments Commission oversaw US military graves in a <b>similar</b> <b>fashion.</b>|$|E

We find survival to be determined by ownership advantages, size and growth strategies, the internal organization of firms, and by industry characteristics such as economies of scale, and industry entry and growth. After controlling for these characteristics, we find that domestic and foreign firms do not exhibit different chances of survival, that they respond in <b>similar</b> <b>fashions</b> to the determinants of survival and display identical time patterns of exit. ...|$|R

5|$|The Moravian {{cultural}} influence {{played a}} significant role in the spread of Christianity onto the Polish lands and the subsequent adoption of that religion. In the opinion of Davies, the Christianisation of Poland through the Czech–Polish alliance represented a conscious choice on the part of Polish rulers to ally themselves with the Czech state rather than the German one. In a <b>similar</b> <b>fashion,</b> some of the later political struggles involved the Polish Church refusing to subordinate itself to the German hierarchy and instead being directly subordinate to the Vatican.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the campaigns fought by the Romans in this legendary account are the wars with various Latin cities and the Sabines. According to Livy, the Latin village of Caenina responded to the event of the {{abduction}} of the Sabine women by invading Roman territory, but were routed and their village captured. The Latins of Antemnae and those of Crustumerium were defeated next in a <b>similar</b> <b>fashion.</b> The remaining {{main body of the}} Sabines attacked Rome and briefly captured the citadel, but were then convinced to conclude a treaty with the Romans under which the Sabines became Roman citizens.|$|E

50|$|The genes {{presumed to}} be {{regulated}} by pfl RNAs relate to one-carbon metabolism. Most obviously, for example, formate-tetrahydrofolate ligase synthesizes 10-formyltetrahydrofolate. The glyA and folD convert between other one-carbon adducts of tetrahydrofolate. Another gene commonly associated with pfl RNAs is purH, which catalyzes the formylation of the intermediate AICAR in de novo synthesis of purines. The formyl group is taken from formyltetrahydrofolate, and purine biosynthesis is often the dominant user of formyltetrahydrofolate. In <b>similar</b> <b>fashions,</b> if less directly, most pfl RNAs are associated with genes that are directly or indirectly involved in one-carbon metabolism. It appears that the ZTP/ZMP purine derivatives {{can be used to}} regulate one-carbon metabolism by indirectly sensing a shortage of 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate.|$|R
5|$|The {{fortification}} of Castle Rising {{was constructed}} in a carefully designed landscape. In front of the castle was the town of Castle Rising, moved to its new site when the castle was built. The settlement {{appears to have been}} laid out to a grid-plan design, possibly bounded by ditches; with the castle positioned just behind it, in a <b>similar</b> <b>fashion</b> to that at New Buckenham and Malton Castle. A dovecot and a religious house were founded nearby; both of these were important symbols of lordship at the time, and were considered essential parts of a properly established castle.|$|E
5|$|A {{feature of}} the wing, which contributed greatly to its success, was an {{innovative}} spar boom design, made up of five square tubes that fitted into each other. As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut away in a <b>similar</b> <b>fashion</b> to a leaf spring; two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web, creating a lightweight and very strong main spar. The undercarriage legs were attached to pivot points built into the inner, rear section of the main spar and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure. The resultant narrow undercarriage track {{was considered to be}} an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing.|$|E
5|$|Although the F-35B {{is fully}} capable of {{performing}} vertical landing, in a <b>similar</b> <b>fashion</b> {{to the way}} that the Harrier and Sea Harrier operated, this method of operation places limitations on the loads that the aircraft is capable of returning to the ship with. As a consequence, to avoid the costly disposal at sea of both fuel and munitions, the Royal Navy is developing the Shipborne rolling vertical landing (SRVL) technique for its operation of the Lightning II. SRVL is a hybrid landing technique that uses the Lightning's vectored thrust capability to slow its forward speed to around 70 knots to allow it to make a rolling landing, using its disc brakes, without the need of an arrestor wire. A special type of metallic 'thermal paint' is being developed to withstand temperatures of up to 1,500C in the vicinity of jet nozzles.|$|E

Gandhi's environmental thought parallels his social thoughts in that environmental sustainability and social inequalities should be managed in <b>similar</b> <b>fashions.</b> His non-violent teachings left a lasting impact, even agriculturally.
