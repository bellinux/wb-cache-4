30|$|In the conduit magma {{convection}} model, degassing occurs under {{low pressure}} {{conditions at the}} top of the convecting magma column and the dense degassed magma descends through the magma column where a volatile-rich less dense magma ascends from a magma chamber to compensate the descending magma (Kazahaya et al., 1994; Shinohara, 2008). The low pressure degassing is consistent with the efficient H 2 O discharge from the H 2 O-poor magma at Shinmoedake. In contrast, the S-poor composition of the volcanic gas and the variation of the SO 2 /H 2 S ratio suggests that the degassing pressure of the Shinmoedake volcanic gases is higher than that at other persistently degassing volcanoes and changed with time (Figs. 7 and 8). However, quantitative evaluation of the degassing pressure for the S-poor composition is not possible due to the lack of the <b>sulfur</b> <b>partition</b> coefficient data.|$|E

The testing was divided into three parts. The first part involved a series of DM 10 melter tests with four different organic feed additives: sugar, polyethylene glycol (PEG), starch, and urea. The second part involved two confirmatory 50 -hour melter tests on the DM 100 using the best combination of reductants and conditions based on the DM 10 results.

The ionic liquid 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium octylsulfate was {{proven to be}} a suitable solvent through screening experiments with model diesel, giving the highest <b>sulfur</b> <b>partition</b> coefficient out of the five studied ILs [3]. The cross solubility of real fuel and BMIMOcSO 4 ionic liquid (IL) was also assessed because it may be a key factor in evaluating the extraction efficiency as BMIMOcSO 4 solubility in liquid fuel may give rise to extractant loss and liquid fuel contamination i.e., if 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium octylsulfate ionic liquid in diesel have noticeable solubility, it may contaminate the fuel and further lead to a NOx pollution, as well as increase the cost of the ionic liquid recycling. By analyzing the BMIMOcSO 4 -saturated diesel sample using HPLC, no IL peak was found. Therefore, it may be concluded that BMIMOcSO 4 has negligible solubility in the real diesel. However, the solubility of real diesel in BMIMOcSO 4 IL was measured using a gravimetric method by weighing the mass difference of a given amount of ILs and the ILs saturated with diesel and {{it was found that the}} Light Cycle Oil (LCO) has a solubility (wt%) of 0.84 in BMIMOcSO 4 IL while the Heavy Cycle Oil (LCO) has a solubility of 1.09 (wt%).|$|E
40|$|Sulfur {{compounds}} (H 2 S and SO 2) {{constitute a}} major fraction of volcanic emissions, with abundance next only to H 2 O and CO 2. Explosive eruptions can inject {{large amounts of}} sulfur into the stratosphere, inducing atmospheric perturbations that may eventually result in changes of the Earth’s average temperature [1]. Before being released during volcanic eruptions, sulfur {{can be stored in}} the silicate melt or in a separate fluid phase [2]. Sulfur contained in sulfur-bearing minerals is usually not released during eruptions because the decomposition reactions are not efficient at the eruptive timescale. The solubility of these minerals in the silicate melt is, however, important because it directly controls the concentration of sulfur in the melt and, indirectly, the amount of sulfur that partitions in the fluid phase. <b>Sulfur</b> <b>partition</b> coefficients for most of the differentiated arc magmas at oxidizing conditions are poorly constrained and large uncertainties exist because of the experimental difficulty to get reliable results. Here we present new experimental data on anhydrite solubility [3] and fluid-melt partition coefficients of sulfur in differentiated arc magma compositions. Melt polymerization, temperature and water content strongly influence the distribution of sulfur among minerals, fluid and melt, by controlling both the anhydrite solubility and the fluid-melt partitioning. Sulfur in less polymerized melts is preferentially accumulated in the melt, because of the high anhydrite solubility and low partion coefficient. At increasing melt polymerization, the solubility of anhydrite decreases and sulfur is preferentially partitioned into the fluid phase or locked up in anhydrite. The interplay between anhydrite solubility and sulfur partitioning yields a maximum distribution of sulfur in the fluid phase at intermediate nbo/t (between 0. 10 and 0. 15) ...|$|E

40|$|The high {{atmospheric}} {{concentrations of}} toxic gases, particulate matter, and acids {{in the areas}} immediately surrounding volcanoes can have negative impacts on human and ecological health. To better understand the atmospheric fate of volcanogenic emissions in the near field (in the first few hours after emission), we have carried out real-time measurements of key chemical components of the volcanic plume from Kılauea on the Island of Hawai‘i. Measurements were made at two locations, one ∼ 3 km north-northeast of the vent and the other 31 km to the southwest, with sampling at each site spanning a range of meteorological conditions and volcanic influence. Instrumentation included a sulfur dioxide monitor and an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor, allowing for a measurement of the partitioning between the two major sulfur species (gas-phase SO[subscript 2] and particulate sulfate) every 5 min. During trade wind conditions, which sent the plume toward the southwest site, <b>sulfur</b> <b>partitioning</b> exhibited a clear diurnal pattern, indicating photochemical oxidation of SO[subscript 2] to sulfate; this enabled the quantitative determination of plume age (5 h) and instantaneous SO[subscript 2] oxidation rate (2. 4 × 10 [superscript – 6] s[superscript – 1] at solar noon). Under stagnant conditions near the crater, the extent of SO[subscript 2] oxidation was substantially higher, suggesting faster oxidation. The particles within the plume were extremely acidic, with pH values (controlled largely by ambient relative humidity) as low as − 0. 8 and strong acidity (controlled largely by absolute sulfate levels) up to 2200 nmol/m[superscript 3].

40|$|Sulfur {{constitutes}} several wt% of chondrite meteorites, the accretion {{material of}} terrestrial planets. Although {{classified as a}} volatile element, sulfur has a significant solubility at high temperature in both molten Fe-metal and silicates, which dominantly depends on the prevailing redox conditions. Redox conditions of planetary bodies during accretion seem extremely heterogeneous as revealed by variable proportions of iron in the metal (Fe) and oxidized (FeO) forms preserved in meteorites and terrestrial planets. Meteorites collections display completely metallic to completely oxidized samples, which probably make of the redox potential, expressed hereafter as oxygen fugacity, the most variable chemical parameter in the primitive solar system (6 log units of variation in fO 2). We have calculated the sulfur distribution between molten silicate and metal {{as a function of}} oxygen fugacity based on available thermodynamic models. We fixed the initial composition of the system in terms of major elements including constant Fe and S contents. We simply allow changes in the ratio of metal over silicate, by simulating variable fO 2 conditions. Increasing fO 2 decreases sulfur solubility in molten silicate because sulfur and oxygen anions compete for a single anionic site in the melt structure. However, at metal-Fe saturation, increasing fO 2 increases FeO content in the silicate, which increases the sulfur solubility in the silicate. This results in rather complex and non-monotonic trends in <b>sulfur</b> <b>partitioning</b> between metal and silicate as fO 2 changes. At very reducing fO 2, typically prevailing in Enstatite chondrite and probably during Mercury's accretion, nearly all <b>sulfur</b> <b>partitions</b> into the silicate portion. Sulfur content in the range 0. 1 - 2 wt% dissolves in the silicate magma ocean. Under relatively oxidized conditions of accretion, probably prevailing in carbonaceous chondrites and on Vesta and Mars, <b>sulfur</b> also strongly <b>partitions</b> in the silicate with concentration in the range 0. 08 - 0. 1 wt%. In contrast, at intermediate fO 2 conditions of accretion such as on Earth, sulfur content in the silicate portion shows a minimum vs. a maximum in S content in the metal. Therefore, accretion of materials homogeneous in S content but differing in their redox state reproduce the high sulfur content in Mars mantle, which exceed the S content in Earth mantle by a factor of 3 - 4. The volcanic gases therefore emitted on Mars were much more sulfur-rich than on Earth, which must have played a critical role on the development of life on Mars...|$|R
30|$|The {{long-term}} stable degassing {{with a large}} {{emission rate}} is characteristic of persistent degassing, which is caused by conduit magma convection (Shinohara, 2008). Considering the large magma degassing rate, the conduit magma convection is the likely mechanism of the degassing at Shin-moedake after the lava effusion. The Shinmoedake volcanic gas composition, however, is quite S-poor compared with other persistently degassing volcanoes at subduction zones (Fig. 8). Melt inclusion analyses suggests that the H 2 O and S contents of the bulk magma are about 2 wt.% and 500 ppm (Saito et al., 2011), implying that the H 2 O/S mol ratio of the bulk magma is 70, {{which is similar to}} other persistently degassing volcanoes, such as the Satsuma-Iwojima and Miyakejima volcanoes (Saito et al., 2001, 2010). The S-poor volcanic gas composition of the Shinmoedake can be due to high-pressure degassing. Based on empirically estimated gas solubility, Giggenbach (1996) modeled the evolution of the gas composition with degassing. The model suggests that a shallow degassing results in a S-rich gas and the composition becomes S-poor with increasing pressure, then becomes also H 2 O-poor with further pressure increase (Fig. 8). This degassing trend qualitatively agrees with the results of recent experimental work by Lense et al. (2011) for basaltic magmas. This degassing trend suggests that the composition difference between the volcanic gases of the Shinmoedake and other persistently degassing volcanoes can be caused by higher pressure degassing at the Shinmoedake than at other volcanoes. The quantitative modeling of the gas composition evolution, however, is still not possible {{because of the lack of}} the experimental <b>sulfur</b> <b>partitioning</b> coefficient; in particular, with silicic magmas at low pressure ranges (Webster and Botcharnikov, 2011). The H 2 O-rich composition of the Shimoedake gases can also be due to the incorporation of meteoric water heated by the lavas in the crater.|$|R
40|$|Severe forcing of Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) on the {{environment}} through massive outpours of volcanic gases such as SO 2 and CO 2 (Self et al., 2008) is suggested by their synchrony with major Phanerozoic mass extinctions, but gas contents of the basalts and gas emission rates are poorly constrained. Here we deal with three LIPs that are synchronous with, and may have triggered, major biotic crises, namely Siberian Traps (end-Permian, c. 250 Ma), CAMP (Central Atlantic magmatic province; end-Triassic, c. 201 Ma) and Deccan Traps (end-Cretaceous, c. 66 Ma) and two LIPs whose emplacement only had a minor impact on the biosphere, i. e. Early Jurassic Karoo-Ferrar (c. 181 Ma) and Early Cretaceous Paranà-Etendeka (PE, c. 134 Ma). Classically, the gas load of a continental flood basalt (CFB) is estimated through analyses of melt-inclusions from early crystallized olivines in degassed flows (Self et al., 2008), but these investigations may be hindered by the paucity of fresh olivine phenocrysts, as for CAMP or PE. Hence, here we illustrate an alternative approach in which the pyroxene/melt <b>sulfur</b> <b>partition</b> coefficient (KD) was appraised on experimentally crystallized clinopyroxenes (augites) from sulphide-saturated basalts (at 525 MPa and 1200 ° or 1175 °C in a piston-cylinder apparatus). S (and Cl) contents were then measured by in-situ micro-XRF (Diamond synchrotron, UK) in augite phenocrysts from rocks chemically representative of the above mentioned LIPs. The magmatic S burden was thus calculated through the experimentally determined KD, starting from the analyzed S in clinopyroxenes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses discarded any presence of sulphide or fluid inclusions in (CAMP) clinopyroxenes, thus justifying {{the use of the}} KD approach, which hinges on the concept of S being distributed at equilibrium between the magma and the crystal lattice. Data are presently available only for CAMP, PE and Deccan, but will shortly be completed with those from the remaining provinces. So far, S contents for Deccan basalts (0. 04 - 0. 14 wt. %) are consistent with those obtained by Self et al. (2008) on melt inclusions. No paramount differences are highlighted between CFB provinces, but, surprisingly, PE high-Ti and CAMP low-Ti samples show the highest and lowest S values, respectively. Rationales for the decoupling between volcanic gas burden and severity of biotic crisis may either be due to PE magmas being emplaced during weaker magmatic pulses at lower eruption rates or S not being the primary cause of environmental perturbations (in favor of CO 2 or other gases). Another hypothesis though hinges on the oxidation state of magmas influencing S solubility (Moretti and Baker, 2008). In this sense, strongly oxidized PE high-Ti basaltic magmas would have retained more S, with consequent reduced gas emissions and minor environmental impact...|$|E

Transgenic plants were produced in which the expression of a yeast SMM transporter, S-Methylmethionine Permease 1 (MMP 1, YLL 061 W), was targeted to the phloem and seeds. Phloem exudate analysis showed that concentrations of SMM are elevated in MMP 1 plants, suggesting increased phloem loading. Furthermore, expression studies of genes involved in S transport and metabolism in source organs, as well as xylem sap analyses, support that S uptake and assimilation are positively affected in MMP 1 roots. Concomitantly, nitrogen (N) assimilation in root and leaf and xylem amino acid profiles were changed, resulting in increased phloem loading of amino acids. When investigating the effects of increased S and N phloem transport on seed metabolism, we found that protein levels were improved in MMP 1 seeds. In addition, changes in SMM phloem loading affected plant growth and seed number, leading to an overall increase in seed S, N, and protein content in MMP 1 plants.

40|$|We {{show that}} the sulfur isotopic {{composition}} of sedimentary and hydrothermal pyrite is a good approximation of the average sulfur isotopic composition of the dissolved sulfide sources from which the pyrite formed. Consequently, pyrite sulfur isotope systematics normally provide little evidence of the pyrite-forming mechanism in most natural systems. Stable <b>sulfur</b> isotope <b>partitioning</b> during pyrite (FeS 2) synthesis via the polysulfide and H 2 S pathways was investigated between 80 and 120 °C. Iron monosulfide (FeS) was reacted with hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) or tetrasulfide (S 42 −) in aqueous solution under strictly anoxic conditions. The results provide independent confirmation of the hydrogen sulfide and polysulfide mechanisms. The measured isotopic composition of the synthesized pyrite is compared with (1) isotopic mixing models of the reactant reservoirs and (2) predictions based on the suggested mechanisms for the hydrogen sulfide and polysulfide pathways for pyrite formation. The isotopic composition of the pyrite product {{is consistent with the}} result predicted from the reaction mechanisms. Pyrite produced via the H 2 S pathway has a composition reflecting isotopic contributions from both FeS and H 2 S reservoirs. Pyrite formed via the polysulfide pathway inherits an isotopic composition dominated by the polysulfide reservoir. In both cases, solubility driven isotope exchange between FeS and aqueous S species contribute to the final pyrite composition. We show that published experimental sulfur isotope data for pyrite formation which apparently support conflicting pyrite-forming pathways, are consistent with pyritization via the polysulfide and H 2 S pathways. Formation rates of natural pyrite, however, may be too slow compared to solubility exchange for the influence of the reaction pathway on the isotopic composition to be significant...|$|R

Our study aimed to investigate the dynamics and distribution of soil S fractions in an 8 -year-old signal grass (Brachiaria decumbens Stapf.) pasture fertilized with nitrogen (N) and S. A factorial combination of two N rates (0 and 600 ?kg N ha 1 y 1, as NH 4 NO 3) and two S rates (0 and 60 ?kg S ha 1 y 1, as gypsum) were applied to signal grass pastures during 2 y. Cattle grazing was controlled during the experimental period. Organic S was the major S pool found in the tropical pasture soil, and represented 97 % to 99 % of total S content. Among the organic S fractions, residual S was the most abundant (42 % to 67 % of total S), followed by ester-bonded S (19 % to 42 %), and C-bonded S (11 % to 19 %). Plant-available inorganic SO 4 -S concentrations were very low, even for the treatments receiving S fertilizers.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} studies related to the incorporation of sulfate in high level waste (HLW) borosilicate glass produced at the Savannah River Site (SRS) Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). A group of simulated HLW glasses produced for earlier sulfate retention studies was selected for full chemical composition measurements {{to determine whether there}} is any clear link between composition and sulfate retention over the compositional region evaluated. In addition, the viscosity of several glasses was measured to support future efforts in modeling sulfate solubility as a function of predicted viscosity. The intent of these studies was to develop a better understanding of sulfate retention in borosilicate HLW glass to allow for higher loadings of sulfate containing waste. Based on the results of these and other studies, the ability to improve sulfate solubility in DWPF borosilicate glasses lies in reducing the connectivity of the glass network structure. This can be achieved, as an example, by increasing the concentration of alkali species in the glass. However, this must be balanced with other effects of reduced network connectivity, such as reduced viscosity, potentially lower chemical durability, {{and in the case of}} higher sodium and aluminum concentrations, the propensity for nepheline crystallization. Future DWPF processing is likely to target higher waste loadings and higher sludge sodium concentrations, meaning that alkali concentrations in the glass will already be relatively high. It is therefore unlikely that there will be the ability to target significantly higher total alkali concentrations in the glass solely to support increased sulfate solubility without the increased alkali concentration causing failure of other Product Composition Control System (PCCS) constraints, such as low viscosity and durability. No individual components were found to provide a significant improvement in sulfate retention (i. e., an increase of the magnitude necessary to have a dramatic impact on blending, washing, or waste loading strategies for DWPF) for the glasses studied here. In general, the concentrations of those species that significantly improve sulfate solubility in a borosilicate glass must be added in relatively large concentrations (e. g., 13 to 38 wt % or more of the frit) in order to have a substantial impact. For DWPF, these concentrations would constitute too large of a portion of the frit to be practical. Therefore, it is unlikely that specific additives may be introduced into the DWPF glass via the frit to significantly improve sulfate solubility. The results presented here continue to show that sulfate solubility or retention is a function of individual glass compositions, rather than a property of a broad glass composition region. It would therefore be inappropriate to set a single sulfate concentration limit for a range of DWPF glass compositions. Sulfate concentration limits should continue to be identified and implemented for each sludge batch. The current PCCS limit is 0. 4 wt % SO{sub 4 }{sup 2 -} in glass, although frit development efforts have led to an increased limit of 0. 6 wt % for recent sludge batches. Slightly higher limits (perhaps 0. 7 - 0. 8 wt %) may be possible for future sludge batches. An opportunity for allowing a higher sulfate concentration limit at DWPF may lay lie in improving the laboratory experiments used to set this limit. That is, there are several differences between the crucible-scale testing currently used to define a limit for DWPF operation and the actual conditions within the DWPF melter. In particular, no allowance is currently made for <b>sulfur</b> <b>partitioning</b> (volatility versus retention) during melter processing as the sulfate limit is set for a specific sludge batch. A better understanding of the <b>partitioning</b> of <b>sulfur</b> in a bubbled melter operating with a cold cap as well as the impacts of sulfur on the off-gas system may allow a higher sulfate concentration limit to be established for the melter feed.

The determination of dissolved and particulate Fe of channels and small rivers close to the study area revealed a 50 -fold higher Fe content of the freshwater environment when compared with North Sea water. Pyrite enrichments are explained by two scenarios: (i) pyrite formation coincides with fen reed peat growth (basal and intercalated) under the influence of a brackish water zone (salinity app. 5 - 15) and (ii) pyrite was formed after peat growth in the lowest limnic basal peat intervals. Maximum pyrite accumulation (TS 28 %) occurs in latter peats that contain thin clastic layers as a result of tidal channel activities after peat formation. The occurrence of clastic layers may have favoured the inflow of saline groundwater. The peat layers are also characterized by enrichments in redox-sensitive trace metals (As, Mo, Re, U) and Cd, whereas Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Tl, and Zn reflect the geogenic background. Leaching experiments have shown that As, Co, Cu, Mo, Re, and Tl are predominantly fixed as sulfides and/or incorporated into pyrite. The remaining trace metals show no distinct trends, only Cr reveals a strong relation to the lithogenic detritus. Seawater is the dominating source for As, Cd, Mo, Re, and U. The remaining trace elements seem to have a freshwater source similar to Fe, In contrast to the distribution of pyrite, highest amounts of redox-sensitive trace metals are seen in fen reed pears (basal and intercalated) that were formed under a direct influence of seawater and brackish water, respectively. Therefore, we suggest that saline groundwater entering the basal peats was probably depleted in redox-sensitive trace metals, e. g. owing to microbially induced reduction of trace metals and subsequent precipitation as sulfides or fixation by organic matter.

Experiments were performed at 1 atm pressure, 1350 °C, with the fugacities of oxygen and sulfur controlled by mixing CO 2, CO, and SO 2 gases. Starting compositions consisted of a CaO-MgO-A 1203 -SiO 2 -FeO-Na 20 analog for a barred olivine chondrule from an ordinary chondrite and a synthetic komatiite. The fo 2 /fs 2 conditions ranged from log fo 2 =- 7. 9 to- 10. 6, with log fs 2 values ranging from- 1. 0 to- 2. 5. Our experimental results demonstrate that the fo 21 fs ~ dependencies of sulfide melt/silicate melt partition coefficients for the first series transition metals are proportional to their valence states. The fo:/fs 2 dependencies for the partitioning of Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu are weaker than predicted {{on the basis of}} their valence states. Variations in fo~/fs 2 conditions have no significant effect on olivine/melt partitioning other than those resulting from fo:induced changes in the valence state of a given element. The strong foJfs 2 dependence for the olivine/silicate melt partitioning of V is attributable to a change of valence state, from 4 + to 3 +, with decreasing fo 2.

40|$|The {{solubility}} of anhydrite in differentiated arc magmas was experimentally {{studied at}} 200 MPa and 800 - 1000 °C over {{a range of}} oxygen fugacities, from 0. 5 log units above the Ni-NiO buffer to the hematite-magnetite buffer. Anhydrite is stable only at oxidizing conditions (fO 2 ≥Re-ReO 2), whereas sulfides only form under reducing conditions. The solubility of anhydrite in the melt ultimately regulates the amount of <b>sulfur</b> available to <b>partition</b> between melt and fluid phase during the eruption. At oxidizing conditions, the solubility product of anhydrite increases with temperature, nbo/t and melt water content. We provide a new calibration of the anhydrite solubility product (KSP=XCaO*XSO 3), which reproduces all available experimental data with greatly improved accuracy:lnKSPAnhydrite= 8. 95 - 146. 5 nbot- 2. 696104 T(K) + 19. 72 nbot 104 T(K) + 0. 409 ·H 2 O(wt. %) In this equation, the molar fractions XCaO and XSO 3 in the melt {{as well as the}} number of non-bridging oxygen atoms per tetrahedron (nbo/t) are calculated on an anhydrous basis (H 2 O refers to the melt water content, T is temperature in Kelvin). We apply our model to estimate the sulfur yield of some recent volcanic eruptions and we show that the sulfur yield of the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo dacite eruption was unusually large, because {{only a small fraction of}} the sulfur was locked up in anhydrite. In general, high sulfur yields are expected when anhydrite solubility in the melt is high, i. e. for somewhat depolymerized melts. For rhyolitic systems, most of the available sulfur will be locked up in anhydrite, so that even very large eruptions may only have a small effect on global surface temperatures. Our model therefore allows improved predictions of the environmental impact of explosive volcanic eruptions...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the terrestrial planets involved a range of complex processes, including accretion, core formation, post-core formation accretion, mantle differentiation and volatile depletion. The earliest processes of accretion and core formation have largely been overprinted on Earth and Mars, but can be investigated using geochemical measurements of extraterrestrial materials. Highly siderophile elements (HSE; Os, Ir, Ru, Rh, Pt, Pd, Re, Au) preferentially partition into metal phases and are therefore powerful tracers for examining mechanisms of core formation on partially differentiated bodies, and differentiation and post-core formation late accretion on fully differentiated planetesimals. Chapter 2 examines the partially-melted, primitive acapulcoite and lodranite meteorites for insight into metal segregation and metal-sulfide partitioning. This work examines the effects of <b>sulfur</b> on HSE <b>partitioning</b> during the earliest stages of core formation, and allows identification of samples that may have derived near the nascent core of the acapulcoite-lodranite parent body. Chapter 3 consists of detailed measurements of the HSE and Os isotopes in eucrite meteorites, revealing new insight into metal-silicate and differentiation of the Asteroid- 4 Vesta. These data are used to identify pristine eucrite samples that may represent the first natural examples of metal-silicate signatures of primary planetary differentiation in the Solar System. The fourth chapter transitions to volatile depletion, and investigates the potential for volatile loss using a model of magma ocean differentiation and constraints from zinc abundance and isotope data in lunar samples. The models constructed demonstrate that the lunar zinc signature, which reflects wholesale volatile depletion from the Moon, {{can be explained by}} surface volatile depletion and subsequent homogenization in a magma ocean. The continuum from core formation, to metal-silicate differentiation and late accretion, to volatile loss provides an overview of planet formation through detailed measurements and analysis of these fundamental mechanisms that occurred during terrestrial planet evolution in the Solar System...|$|R

Our experimentally determined partition coefficients are used to develop models for the segregation of sulfide and metal from the silicate portion of the early Earth and the Shergottite parent body (Mars). We find that the influence of S is not sufficient to explain the overabundance of siderophile and chalcophile elements that remained in the mantle of the Earth following core formation. Important constraints on core formation in Mars are provided by our experimental determination of the partitioning of Cu between silicate and sulfide melts. When combined with existing estimates for siderophile element abundances in the Martian mantle and a mass balance constraint from Fe, the experiments allow a determination of the mass of the Martian core (approx. 17 to 22 wt% of the planet) and its S content (approx. 0. 4 wt%). These modeling results indicate that Mars is depleted in S, and that its core is solid...|$|R
40|$|Gasification {{of black}} liquor (BLG) has {{distinct}} advantages over direct combustion in Tomlinson recovery boilers. In this project {{we seek to}} resolve causticizing issues {{in order to make}} pressurized BLG even more efficient and cost-effective. One advantage of BLG is that the inherent partial separation of sulfur and sodium during gasification lends itself to the use of proven high yield variants to conventional kraft pulping which require just such a separation. Processes such as polysulfide, split sulfidity, ASAQ, and MSSAQ can increase pulp yield from 1 % to 10 % over conventional kraft but require varying degrees of sulfur/sodium separation, which requires additional [and costly] processing in a conventional Tomlinson recovery process. However during gasification, the <b>sulfur</b> is <b>partitioned</b> between the gas and smelt phases, while the sodium all leaves in the smelt; thus creating the opportunity to produce sulfur-rich and sulfur-lean white liquors for specialty pulping processes. A second major incentive of BLG is the production of a combustible product gas, rich in H 2 and CO. This product gas (a. k. a. “syngas”) can be used in gas turbines for combined cycle power generation (which is twice as efficient as the steam cycle alone), or it {{can be used as a}} precursor to form liquid fuels, such as dimethyl ether or Fischer Tropsh diesel. There is drawback to BLG, which has the potential to become a third major incentive if this work is successful. The causticizing load is greater for gasification of black liquor than for combustion in a Tomlinson boiler. So implementing BLG in an existing mill would require costly increases to the causticizing capacity. In situ causticizing [within the gasifier] would handle the entire causticizing load and therefore eliminate the lime cycle entirely. Previous work by the author and others has shown that titanate direct causticizing (i. e. in situ) works quite well for high-temperature BLG (950 °C), but was limited to pressures below about 5 bar. It is desirable however to operate BLG at 20 - 30 bar for efficiency reasons related to either firing the syngas in a turbine, or catalytically forming liquid fuels. This work focused on achieving high direct causticizing yields at 20 bars pressure. The titanate direct causticizing reactions are inhibited by CO 2. Previous work has shown that the partial pressure of CO 2 should be kept below about 0. 5 bar in order for the process to work. This translates to a total reactor pressure limit of about 5 bar for airblown BLG, and only 2 bar for O 2 -blown BLG. In this work a process was developed in which the CO 2 partial pressure could be manipulated to a level under 0. 5 bar with the total system pressure at 10 bar during O 2 -blown BLG. This fell short of our 20 bar goal but still represents a substantial increase in the pressure limit. A material and energy balance was performed, as well as first-pass economics based on capital and utilities costs. Compared to a reference case of using BLG with a conventional lime cycle [Larson, 2003], the IRR and NVP were estimated for further replacing the lime kiln with direct causticizing. The economics are strongly dependent on the price of lime kiln fuel. At $ 6 /mmBTU the lime cycle is the clear choice. At $ 8 /mmBTU the NPV is $ 10 M with IRR of 17 %. At $ 12 /mmBTU the NPV is $ 45 M with IRR of 36 %. To further increase the total allowable pressure, the CO 2 could be further decreased by further decreasing the temperature. Testing should be done at 750 C. Also a small pilot should be built...|$|R
