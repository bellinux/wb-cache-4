Opioid receptors are abundant in multiple regions of {{the central nervous system}} and the peripheral nervous system including enteric neurons. Opioid-related adverse effects such as constipation, nausea, and vomiting pose challenges for compliance and continuation of the therapy for chronic pain management. In the post-operative setting opioid-induced depression of respiration can be fatal. These critical limitations warrant a better understanding of their underpinning cellular and molecular mechanisms to inform the design of novel opioid analgesic molecules that are devoid of these unwanted side-effects. Research efforts on opioid receptor signalling in the past decade suggest that differential signalling pathways and downstream molecules preferentially mediate distinct pharmacological effects. Additionally, interaction among opioid receptors and, between opioid receptor and non-opioid receptors to form signalling complexes shows that opioid-induced receptor signalling is potentially more complicated than previously thought. This complexity provides an opportunity to identify and probe relationships between <b>selective</b> <b>signalling</b> pathway specificity and in vivo production of opioid-related adverse effects.

Edwards, Nature (London) 349 : 747 - 749, 1991]. Here, we characterize further its action as a potent, <b>selective</b> <b>signalling</b> agonist. In-gel kinase assays show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) transiently activates five kinases: the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases ERK- 1 and - 2, and three others, p 45, p 55, and p 80. Anisomycin, at inhibitory and subinhibitory concentrations, does not activate ERK- 1 and - 2 but elicits strong sustained activation of p 45 and p 55, which are unique in being serine kinases whose detection is enhanced with poly-Glu/Tyr or poly-Glu/Phe copolymerized in these gels. Translational arrest using emetine or puromycin does not activate p 45 and p 55 but does prolong EGF-stimulated ERK- 1 and - 2 activation. Rapamycin, which blocks anisomycin-stimulated p 70 / 85 S 6 k activation without affecting nuclear responses, has no effect on p 45 or p 55 kinase. p 45 and p 55 are activable by okadaic acid or UV irradiation, and both kinases phosphorylate the c-Jun NH 2 -terminal peptide 1 - 79, putatively placing them within c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) subfamily of MAP kinases.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 179 - 202). The pituitary gonadotrophin {{releasing hormone}} (GnRH) receptor regulates reproduction by activation of Gq/ 11 proteins. In contrast, GnRH receptors at extrapituitary sites induce anti-proliferative effects {{that do not}} correlate with Gq/ 11 activation. We propose that the two endogenous ligands, GnRH I and GnRH II, and certain antagonists selectively activate distinct signalling pathways by stabilisation of distinct active conformations of the GnRH receptor, a concept termed ligand-induced <b>selective</b> <b>signalling</b> (LiSS). This dissertation has investigated LiSS at the GnRH receptor using several approaches. The sequences of GnRH I and II differ in positions 5, 7 and 8. I investigated the interaction of position 5 of GnRH I and GnRH II with Tyr 6. 58 of the receptor. Compared with the Leu and Ala mutants, the Tyr 6. 58 Phe mutant had higher affinity for native GnRHs, but not Ala 5 -substituted GnRHs, suggesting that Tyr 5 of GnRH I and His 5 of GnRH II interact with Tyr 6. 58 by aromatic interactions. Our molecular models show that GnRHs interact with distinct rotamer conformations of Tyr 6. 58. This {{is supported by the}} Tyr 6. 58 Leu receptor, which makes compensatory interactions that improve binding affinity and receptor activation for GnRH II, but not GnRH I, compared with the Tyr 6. 58 Ala receptor. Together these results suggest that GnRHs stabilise distinct receptor active conformations. To identify the most proximal signalling proteins that mediate GnRH receptordependent anti-proliferative effects, I established a range of [35 S]GTPS binding assays. I confirmed that the GnRH receptor activates Gq/ 11, but in contrast to previous proposals, my results show that the GnRH receptor cannot directly activate Gi. I subsequently identified a novel GnRH receptor signalling partner, the SH 2 domaincontaining phosphatase 2 (SHP- 2). I propose that SHP- 2 mediates the antiproliferative effects of the receptor. I show that the SHP- 2 pathway is activated independently of Gq/ 11 and suggest that signalling occurs by a direct interaction of SHP- 2 and src with the GnRH receptor. Furthermore, this pathway is activated by a classical Gq/ 11 antagonist or by Gq/ 11 -uncoupled GnRH receptor mutants. My results provide convincing evidence supporting LiSS at the GnRH receptor and may facilitate development of therapeutics with increased signalling specificity at this receptor...|$|E

Selective {{agonists}} and antagonists of gonadotropin receptors would be of great interest for the treatment of infertility or as non steroidal contraceptive. However, to date, only native hormones are being used in assisted reproduction technologies as there is no pharmacological agent available to manipulate gonadotropin receptors. Over the last decade, there has been a growing perception of the complexity associated with gonadotropin receptors’ cellular signaling. It is now clear that the Gs/cAMP/PKA pathway is not the sole mechanism that must be taken into account in order to understand these hormones’ biological actions. In parallel, consistent with the emerging paradigm of biased agonism, several examples of ligand-mediated <b>selective</b> <b>signaling</b> pathway activation by gonadotropin receptors have been reported.

40|$|Hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) (GnRH I) is {{the central}} {{regulator}} of the mammalian reproductive system. Most vertebrates studied also possess a second form of GnRH, GnRH II. GnRH I acts on its cognate G proteincoupled receptor (GPCR) on pituitary gonadotropes and activates Gq/ 11 -mediated signalling pathways to stimulate the biosynthesis {{and the release of}} luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Both GnRHs have also been suggested to inhibit cellular proliferation, an action which has largely been proposed to be mediated by the coupling of the receptor to Gi/o. However, the range of G proteins activated by the GnRH receptor and the signalling cascades involved in inducing antiproliferation remain controversial. To delineate the G protein coupling selectivity of the mammalian GnRH receptor and to identify the signalling pathways involved in GnRH I-mediated cell growth inhibition, I examined the ability of the receptor to interact with Gq/ 11, Gi/o and Gs in Gαq/ 11 knockout MEF cells. My results indicate that the receptor is unable to interact with Gi/o but can signal through Gq/ 11. Additionally, my data do not support the suggestion of GnRH receptor-Gs interaction. Furthermore, I show that the GnRH Iinduced inhibition of cell growth is dependent on Gq/ 11, src and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) but is independent of the activity of protein kinase C (PKC), Ca 2 +, jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) or P 38. Based on these findings and previous research within our group, I propose a mechanism whereby GnRH I may induce antiproliferation. Previous studies from our laboratory suggest that the GnRH receptor can adopt distinct active conformations in response to the binding of GnRH I and GnRH II. These data thus account for our hypothesis of ligand-induced <b>selective</b> <b>signalling</b> (LiSS). Given my previous results, I examined the ability of the GnRH receptor to couple to G 12 / 13. My work indicates that the receptor can directly activate G 12 / 13 and the downstream signalling cascades associated with this G protein family. Indeed, I provide evidence, in several cellular backgrounds, to suggest that GnRH receptor- G 12 / 13 -mediated signalling is involved in the regulation of GnRH-induced MAPK activity, SRE-driven gene transcription and cytoskeletal reorganisation. Furthermore, I propose a role for these G proteins in the transcriptional regulation of LHβ and FSHβ. Finally, I confirm previous results from our laboratory indicating that the GnRH receptor may interact with src Tyr kinase and show that GnRH I but not GnRH II may, independently of Gq/ 11, stimulate the Tyr phosphorylation and thus the activation of this protein. I propose that this differential signalling accounts for the distinct effects of GnRH I and GnRH II on cellular morphology and SREpromoted transcriptional activity. The research presented within this thesis provides evidence to refute published conclusions based on largely circumstantial experimental data, describes novel GnRH receptor signalling pathways and offers support for the concept of LiSS. It may assist in the development of new therapeutic compounds which selectively target one GnRH-mediated signalling pathway while bypassing others.

40|$|G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate a {{multitude}} of responses serving hormonal, neurotransmitter, and sensory functions. These receptors are important drug targets; in fact, about 27 % of prescribed drugs are GPCR ligands. The dopamine D 2 receptor is prominently expressed within the CNS as two distinct isoforms; D 2 L (long isoform) and D 2 S (short isoform). The former is mainly expressed postsynaptically, whereas the latter functions primarily as an inhibitory auto- and heteroreceptor. The D 2 receptor is of considerable pharmacological interest, as it constitutes the main target for most antiparkinsonian and antipsychotic drugs in clinical use. While many ion channels have long been known to be voltage sensitive, this property has not been attributed to GPCRs until quite recently. As a notable example, the muscarinic M 2 receptor was shown to display depolarization-induced decreases in agonist binding and functional potency. M 2 receptor voltage sensitivity has been implicated in the autoreceptor function of this GPCR, by permitting rapid control of neurotransmitter release kinetics by membrane voltage. The present work investigated the voltage sensitivities of the three D 2 -like dopamine receptors; D 2, D 3, and D 4. The bulk of the experiments were carried out in Xenopus oocytes heterologously expressing D 2 -like receptors with G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channel (GIRK) subunits. GIRK channels are activated by Gβγ subunits from inhibitory G proteins and were used as readout of receptor activation. It was found that dopamine potency was reduced by depolarization to a similar extent at both isoforms of the D 2 receptor. However, at the dopamine D 3 receptor dopamine potency was not significantly affected, while a weak, albeit significant potency decrease was observed at the dopamine D 4 receptor. Moreover, in mammalian cells expressing fluorescent G protein subunits, changes in inter-subunit Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) were used as readout of D 2 S receptor activation. Determination of dopamine concentration-response relationships in single cells under simultaneous patch clamp revealed similar depolarization-induced potency shifts as when studying GIRK channel activation in oocytes. Furthermore, radioligand binding experiments carried out on oocytes in hyperpolarizing vs. depolarizing buffer established that dopamine binding is reduced by depolarization. Interestingly, the effect of voltage was different for different agonists at the D 2 S receptor, including efficacious, high-affinity antiparkinsonian agonists. This agonist-specificity did not reflect <b>selective</b> <b>signalling</b> via distinct G protein subtypes. However, contacts between agonist hydroxyl groups and receptor serine residues, {{as well as between}} the agonist amine group and a conserved aspartate residue, were found to be important for the voltage induced potency shift of phenethylamine agonists, such as dopamine. In conclusion, the findings presented in this thesis suggest that the dopamine D 2 -like receptors are differentially affected by voltage. At the D 2 S receptor, specific agonistreceptor interactions determine the effect of the receptor’s voltage sensitivity on agonist potency and efficacy. This information demonstrates the relevance of GPCR voltage sensitivity to dopaminergic signalling, reveals new details about the mechanism of voltage sensitive agonism, and points to the possibility of using differentially voltagemodulated agonists to investigate the relevance of this phenomenon in native tissue...|$|E
40|$|The CB₁ {{cannabinoid}} receptor (CB₁R) {{is a potential}} target {{for the treatment of}} numerous central nervous system disorders. Although a large number of CB₁R ligands exist, their therapeutic applications are limited due to adverse on-target effects. Selective activation of the receptor signalling events that mediate desired therapeutic effects at the expense of those that mediate adverse effects may overcome adverse on-target effects. This could be achieved via a phenomenon referred to as ligand-biased signalling. There is growing evidence that CB₁R ligands may activate <b>selective</b> <b>signalling</b> pathways and engender biased signalling (Bosier et al., 2008 b). More strikingly, CB₁R allosteric modulators, such as Org 27569 may also display pathway selective modulation or biased allosterism (Ahn et al., 2012). Several endogenous allosteric modulators at CB 1 Rs have also been suggested, including pregnenolone (Vallee et al., 2014), lipoxin A 4 (Pamplona et al., 2012) and CRIP 1 a (Niehaus et al., 2007). The current investigation aimed to detect and quantify ligand-biased signalling and allosterism at CB₁Rs using sophisticated analytical methods, in order to establish potential CB₁R biased “fingerprints” that may guide structure-activity and drug discovery studies. Our results showed that 2 -AG and WIN 55, 212 - 2 had little preference for cAMP inhibition and pERK 1 / 2 activation (bias factor not dissimilar from 1). However, anandamide, Δ 9 -THC, CP 55940 and in particular HU- 210 and methanandamide with bias factors of over 20 and 15, respectively were biased towards cAMP inhibition. We also demonstrated that Org 27569 reduced the CB₁R inverse agonist [ᶟH]SR 141716 A binding, indicated by a binding cooperativity (α) value close to 0. However, it had little effect on the binding of cannabinoid agonists (α close to 1). Org 27569 completely abolished inhibition of cAMP by all the cannabinoids tested, indicated by functional cooperativity (β) values approaching 0. Interestingly, however, in pERK 1 / 2 assays, Org 27569 abolished the response to HU- 210 and CP 55940, had no significant effect on pERK 1 / 2 activation by anandamide, methanandamide and Δ 9 -THC, and only partially inhibited 2 -AG and WIN 55, 212 - 2 -induced pERK 1 / 2 activation, as indicated by β values ranging from 0 to 1. This clearly indicates strong probe-dependence and biased allosterism by Org 27569. Furthermore, our results showed no inhibitory effects on Δ 9 -THC-induced pERK 1 / 2 activation by pregnenolone, and no enhancing effects on anandamide-mediated inhibition of cAMP by lipoxin A 4, in contrast to previous findings (Pamplona et al., 2012; Vallee et al., 2014). Our results also demonstrated that CRIP 1 a knockdown in NG 108 - 15 cells abolished WIN 55, 212 - 2 -induced cAMP inhibition and reduced KCl-induced Ca²⁺ influx. However, it had no effects on cannabinoid-mediated Ca²⁺ mobilisation. In recombinant HEK-CB 1 -TREx CRIP 1 a cells, cannabinoid-mediated cAMP and pERK 1 / 2 signalling was unchanged in the absence or presence of CRIP 1 a. Therefore, further research is required to verify the allosteric nature of these endogenous ligands. In conclusion, this study quantifies, for the first time, ligand-biased signalling from CB 1 Rs, provides quantitative insights into biased allosterism and probe-dependence by the small molecule Org 27569 at CB 1 Rs, provides evidence against the reported allosteric effects of the endogenous ligands lipoxin A 4 and pregnenolone, and demonstrates the cell line-dependent effects of CRIP 1 a.

40|$|Protease-activated {{receptor}}- 1 (PAR 1) is a G-protein–coupled receptor uniquely {{activated by}} proteolysis. Thrombin, a coagulant protease, induces inflammatory responses and endothelial barrier permeability through the activation of PAR 1. Activated protein C (APC), an anti-coagulant protease, also activates PAR 1. However, unlike thrombin, APC elicits anti-inflammatory responses and protects against endothelial barrier dysfunction induced by thrombin. We found that thrombin and APC signaling {{were lost in}} PAR 1 -deficient endothelial cells, indicating that PAR 1 is the major effector of protease signaling. To delineate the mechanism responsible for protease-selective signaling by PAR 1, we examined the effect of APC and thrombin on the activation of RhoA and Rac 1, small GTPases that differentially regulate endothelial barrier permeability. Thrombin caused robust RhoA signaling but not Rac 1 activation, whereas APC stimulated a marked increase in Rac 1 activation but not RhoA signaling, consistent with the opposing functions of these proteases on endothelial barrier integrity. Strikingly, APC signaling and endothelial barrier protection effects were abolished in cells lacking caveolin- 1, whereas thrombin signaling remained intact. These findings suggest that compartmentalization of PAR 1 in caveolae is critical for APC <b>selective</b> <b>signaling</b> to Rac 1 activation and endothelial barrier protection. We further report that APC induces PAR 1 phosphorylation and desensitizes endothelial cells to thrombin signaling but promotes limited receptor cleavage and negligible internalization and degradation even after prolonged APC exposure.

The concept of Raman suppression {{can be used to}} achieve sub-diffraction-limited resolution in label-free microscopy by exploiting spatially <b>selective</b> <b>signal</b> suppression when imaging a sample with a combination of Gaussian- and donut-shaped beams and reconstructing a resolution-enhanced image from this data. Using a nanosecond pulsed laser source with an emission wavelength of 355 nm, the ground state of tris(bipyridine) ruthenium(II) molecules solved in acetonitrile was depleted and the spontaneous Raman scattering at 355 nm suppressed by nearly 50 %. Based on spectroscopic data retrieved from our experiment, we modeled the Raman image of a scattering center in order to demonstrate the applicability of this effect for superresolution Raman microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Proper protein {{localization}} {{is essential}} for all cells. However, the precise mechanism by which high fidelity is achieved is not well understood for any protein-targeting pathway. To address this fundamental question, we investigated the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway in Escherichia coli, which delivers proteins to the bacterial inner membrane through recognition of signal sequences on cargo proteins. Fidelity was thought to arise from the inability of SRP to bind strongly to incorrect cargos. Using biophysical assays, we found that incorrect cargos were also rejected {{through a series of}} checkpoints during subsequent steps of targeting. Thus, high fidelity of substrate selection is achieved through the cumulative effect of multiple checkpoints; this principle may be generally applicable to other pathways involving <b>selective</b> <b>signal</b> recognition...|$|R
40|$|Protein kinase C (PKC) {{activation}} {{plays an}} important role in morphine-induced m-opioid receptor (OPRM 1) desensitization and tolerance development. It was recently shown that receptor phosphorylation by G protein–coupled receptor kinase regu-lates agonist-dependent <b>selective</b> <b>signaling</b> and that inefficient phosphorylation of OPRM 1 leads to PKC « activation and sub-sequent responses. Here, we demonstrate that such receptor phosphorylation and PKC « activation can be modulated by FK 506 -binding protein 12 (FKBP 12). Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, FKBP 12 was identified as specifically interacting with OPRM 1 at the Pro 353 residue. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing OPRM 1, the association of FKBP 12 with OPRM 1 decreased the agonist-induced receptor phosphoryla-tion at Ser 375. The morphine-induced PKC « activation and th...|$|R
40|$|AbstractClonal {{selection}} theories postulate that lymphocyte fate {{is regulated}} by antigen receptor specificity. However, lymphocyte apoptosis is induced through non-antigen-specific receptors such as Fas (CD 95 /APO- 1) or TNFR. We define a selective TCR that controls apoptosis by Fas or TNFR stimulation. Variant ligands can deliver this “competence to die” signal without the full TCR signals necessary for cytokine synthesis. These partial agonists regulate T cell deletion in vivo even when Fas or TNF {{is provided by}} T cells of unrelated specificity, {{but they do not}} cause the liver necrosis that is associated with T cell elimination by the full agonist. Thus, <b>selective</b> <b>signaling</b> ligands regulate T cell deletion and immune damage in vivo and may be important for peripheral T cell tolerance...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{selection}} often favors {{brighter and}} exaggerated traits, which {{also increase the}} risk of detection by predators. Signals that are preferentially conspicuous to conspecifics would reduce the predation cost of signaling and, therefore, might facilitate the evolution of stronger sexual and social <b>signals.</b> This <b>selective</b> <b>signaling</b> is possible if predators and prey have differently tuned sensory systems. By using a retinal model to compare reflectance from the plumages of Swedish songbirds to the reflectance of their natural backgrounds, we found their color badges to be significantly more conspicuous to other songbirds (which have a UV-tuned visual system) than to raptors and corvids (which have a violet-tuned system) in both coniferous and deciduous forests, consistent with an adaptive private communication system...|$|R
40|$|Some protein kinases {{operate in}} more than one mitogen-activated protein-kinase (MAPK) cascade. We here address the {{question}} whether specificity of the cascades necessitates physical sequestration of these "promiscuous" kinases (e. g. by binding to scaffolds). A model is constructed, in which two MAPK cascades depend on a single MAP-kinase kinase that is not sequestered in two subpopulations. We show that in this model <b>selective</b> <b>signal</b> transduction is possible provided that there is an additional interaction at the MAP-kinase level, there is no simultaneous activation of more than one response by either signal. We discuss a number of additional interactions that can generate the selectivity, as well as some kinetic features by which this mechanism may be recognized experimentally. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|AbstractErythroid {{differentiation}} of normal human hematopoietic progenitor cells was drastically inhibited by phorbol ester, 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA), an agent known {{to activate the}} class of serine-threonine kinases, protein kinase C (PKC). This inhibition was accompanied by augmented megakaryocytic differentiation as demonstrated by expression of megakaryocyte-specific mRNAs and proteins. These effects of PMA were reversed by two specific antagonists of PKC. Analysis of single colonies transferred from cultures not containing PMA to PMA-containing cultures indicated that, in this system, PMA exerts megakaryocytic differentiating activity directly on cells which may have already initiated a progression toward the erythroid pathway of differentiation. These results suggest that modulation of PKC activity {{plays a role in}} erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation, and may constitute an important <b>selective</b> <b>signal</b> between these pathways during normal blood cell development...|$|R
