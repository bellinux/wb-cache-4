5|$|Hugh {{afterwards}} became archdeacon of York and {{treasurer of}} York, sometime around 1143, probably through the patronage of William FitzHerbert {{while he was}} serving his first term as Archbishop of York. While treasurer, {{he was a member}} of the party at York that wanted to elect Hilary as archbishop after William FitzHerbert's deposition in 1147. The <b>successful</b> <b>candidate</b> was Henry Murdac, the Abbot of Fountains, who was supported by the bishops of Durham and Carlisle, William of St. Barbara and Æthelwold respectively. Murdac excommunicated Hugh, who returned the gesture.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, {{media reports}} linked Brown {{with the role}} as the next {{managing}} director of the International Monetary Fund following the scheduled retirement of Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Brown's successor and Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband, supported Brown for the role while the Prime Minister, David Cameron, voiced opposition to this. Following the arrest of Strauss-Kahn for alleged sexual assault in May 2011, and his subsequent resignation, these reports re-surfaced. Support for Brown among economists was mixed but British Government backing for his candidature was not forthcoming and instead supported Christine Lagarde – the eventual <b>successful</b> <b>candidate</b> – for the post.|$|E
5|$|Tillman {{spoke at}} the opening of Clemson College on July 6, 1893. He {{fulfilled}} his campaign promise to start a women's college. In 1891, the legislature passed a bill creating the South Carolina Industrial and Winthrop Normal College (today Winthrop University). He took a personal interest in the bidding by various towns around the state for the new school, and supported the <b>successful</b> <b>candidate,</b> the progressive town of Rock Hill, on the state's northern border. Rock Hill officials had offered land, cash, and building materials. The school, then admitting only white women, opened in October 1895, after Tillman had become a senator.|$|E
50|$|The Commonwealth Electoral Act was {{amended to}} provide for a recount using the half Senate quota, limited to the <b>successful</b> <b>candidates.</b> The {{rationale}} for limiting the recount to the <b>successful</b> <b>candidates</b> was to eliminate the chance of an unsuccessful candidate being in the recount {{as a result of}} the complex preference flows. It is not apparent what, if any, impact this limitation would have on the order of <b>successful</b> <b>candidates.</b>|$|R

5|$|McGovern {{grew up in}} Mitchell, South Dakota, {{where he}} was a renowned debater. He volunteered for the U.S.Army Air Forces upon the country's entry into World WarII and as a B-24 Liberator pilot flew 35frequently {{dangerous}} missions over German-occupied Europe. Among the medals bestowed upon him was a Distinguished Flying Cross for making a hazardous emergency landing of his damaged plane and saving his crew. After the war he gained degrees from Dakota Wesleyan University and Northwestern University, culminating in a PhD, and was a history professor. He was elected to the U.S.House of Representatives in 1956 and re-elected in 1958. After a failed bid for the U.S.Senate in 1960, he was a <b>successful</b> <b>candidate</b> in 1962.|$|E
5|$|While {{awaiting}} {{the final decision}} in his case, William took up residence {{with one of his}} friends, Roger II, King of Sicily. Hearing of his suspension, some of William's supporters in York launched a damaging attack upon Fountains Abbey which destroyed many of the buildings. William was formally deposed as archbishop by Eugene in early 1147 and the deposition was confirmed at the Council of Reims on 21 March 1148. Another election to York was held, and the candidates included Hilary of Chichester, who was the king's candidate, and Henry Murdac, the Cistercian abbot of Fountains Abbey. Murdac's supporters included the Cistercians and most of the clergy of the diocese, including William's former ally, William of St. Barbara. Both sides appealed to the pope, and the pope confirmed Murdac as the <b>successful</b> <b>candidate.</b> William then returned to Winchester, the city he had left forty years earlier to begin his career in York.|$|E

25|$|First, a maximum-likelihood principle, {{based on}} the idea to {{increase}} the probability of <b>successful</b> <b>candidate</b> solutions and search steps. The mean of the distribution is updated such that the likelihood of previously <b>successful</b> <b>candidate</b> solutions is maximized. The covariance matrix of the distribution is updated (incrementally) such that the likelihood of previously successful search steps is increased. Both updates can be interpreted as a natural gradient descent. Also, in consequence, the CMA conducts an iterated principal components analysis of successful search steps while retaining all principal axes. Estimation of distribution algorithms and the Cross-Entropy Method are based on very similar ideas, but estimate (non-incrementally) the covariance matrix by maximizing the likelihood of successful solution points instead of successful search steps.|$|E
