Tyndall {{stood in the}} East London {{constituency}} of Poplar and Canning Town, where he received 7.26% of the vote. Tyndall claimed that following the election, the party received between 2,500 and 3,000 enquiries—roughly {{the same as they}} had received after the 1983 general election—although far fewer of these enquirers became members.|$|E
5|$|When in 1415 Sir Piers Legh II {{was wounded}} in the Battle of Agincourt, his mastiff <b>stood</b> <b>over</b> and {{protected}} him for many hours through the battle. The mastiff was later returned to Legh's home and was the foundation of the Lyme Hall Mastiffs. They were bred at the hall and kept separate from other strains, figuring prominently in founding the modern breed. The strain died out around the beginning of the 20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|A {{statue of}} Mercury <b>stood</b> <b>over</b> the {{entrance}} to the Dominion Theatre in London's West End from May 2002 to May 2014 for Queen and Ben Elton's musical We Will Rock You. A tribute to Queen was on display at the Fremont Street Experience in downtown Las Vegas throughout 2009 on its video canopy. In December 2009 a large model of Mercury wearing tartan was put on display in Edinburgh as publicity for the run of We Will Rock You at the Playhouse Theatre.|$|E

5|$|Coastal {{scenes were}} filmed at Bass Rock and near Trancas, while other scenes were filmed near Signal Hill. The film's climax was filmed {{around the area}} of the Union Station train depot. The large gas tank, which <b>stood</b> <b>over</b> 300 feet tall, was made {{available}} to the cast and crew by the Southern California Gas Company. Filming at this location proved to be a challenge, as the cast and crew had trouble communicating with each other, with Clarke attempting to direct the film crew while on top of the large structure.|$|E
5|$|Father McCue (Arnie Walters) {{contacts}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and asks}} for her help in the case. Scully visits the Kernofs, and learns that Dara was adopted six years earlier. Due to her severe spinal deformities, there is no explanation as to how Dara {{walked out of the}} house. Lance is convinced that it was the Devil that <b>stood</b> <b>over</b> her in the street. Scully examines Dara's body with a pathologist Vicki Belon (Lorraine Landry), who notes her surgically removed extra fingers. Belon reluctantly proposes that the girl was struck down by God, as if she was a mistake.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{plans for}} both his {{marriage}} to Mary and his appointment as Viceroy of Ireland were under discussion, Albert Victor fell ill with influenza in the pandemic of 1889–92. He developed pneumonia and died at Sandringham House in Norfolk on 14 January 1892, {{less than a week}} after his 28th birthday. The Prince and Princess of Wales, Princesses Maud and Victoria, Prince George, Princess Mary, the Duke and Duchess of Teck, three physicians (Alan Reeve Manby, Francis Laking and William Broadbent) and three nurses were present.

5|$|Temple 26 (Structure 5D-26) is {{the central}} {{building}} in the North Acropolis, located centrally {{on the south side}} of the basal platform overlooking the terrace; the earliest version of this structure dates to approximately AD 250. Temple 26 has been fully excavated and restored. A tomb in the structure was looted at some time during the Postclassic period. The northern portion of the structure <b>stood</b> <b>over</b> a Late Preclassic tomb (Burial 85) dated to around AD 100, which has been tentatively identified as that of dynastic founder Yax Ehb' Xook.|$|E
5|$|The pre-credits {{sequence}} used {{a church}} in Stoke Poges as a cemetery, while the helicopter scenes were filmed at the abandoned Beckton Gas Works in London. The gas works were also the location for some of Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film, Full Metal Jacket. Director John Glen {{got the idea for}} the remote-controlled helicopter after seeing a child playing with an RC car. Since flying a helicopter through a warehouse was thought to be too dangerous, the scene was shot using forced perspective. A smaller mock-up was built by Derek Meddings' team closer to the camera that the stunt pilot Marc Wolff flew behind and this made it seem as if the helicopter was entering the warehouse. The footage inside the building was shot on location, though with a life-sized helicopter model which <b>stood</b> <b>over</b> a rail. Stuntman Martin Grace stood as Bond when the agent is dangling outside the flying helicopter, while Roger Moore himself was used in the scenes inside the model.|$|E
25|$|The {{interchange}} at {{the beginning}} of I-280 and I-680 was constructed years before its completion.

In 2010, the interchange was named the Joe Colla Interchange.|$|E

While an officer was executing the order, a group of women gathered to prevent the operation, and one of them, a nun named Theodosia, let him fall from the ladder.

25|$|After Eric Cantona's {{unexpected}} retirement, Keane {{took over}} as club captain, although he missed most of the 1997–98 season because of a cruciate ligament injury caused by an attempt to tackle Leeds United player Alf-Inge Håland in the ninth Premier League game of the season. As Keane lay prone on the ground, Håland <b>stood</b> <b>over</b> Keane, accusing the injured United captain of having tried to hurt him and of feigning injury to escape punishment, an allegation which would lead to an infamous incident between the two players four years later.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, an {{elementary}} school in Camberwell known as the Greencoat School was closed after a 250-year history and part of its assets passed to Wilson's Grammar School. The funds were used to provide a new science facility, the Greencoat Building, which was constructed opposite the main school site in Wilson Road. Two carved figures of {{a boy and a}} girl which are believed to have <b>stood</b> <b>over</b> the boys' and girls' entrances to the school were installed first in the Greencoat Building, and later in the Greencoat Courtyard in the new school at Wallington.|$|E

Karl Boro made it up on to the roof but then made the mistake of coming back into the building, where he was treated to heavy {{bruising}} to his arms and legs, a fractured skull, and bleeding in his chest cavity. Jaroslaw Engel, from Poland, managed to use builders' scaffolding {{to get out of the}} school, but he was caught in the street by some police drivers who smashed him over the head, laid him on the ground and <b>stood</b> <b>over</b> him smoking while his blood ran out across the tarmac.|$|E
25|$|The lecture circuit {{business}} proved lucrative {{enough for}} Lowe {{to seek out}} the education he so lacked as a child. He tried studying medicine to fulfill his grandmother's wish, but the boredom redirected him to his first interest, aviation with the use of lighter-than-air gases. American balloonists used coke gas to inflate limp silk bags, as opposed to the original French balloons which were cotton weave over rigid frameworks that were <b>stood</b> <b>over</b> fires to collect hot smoke (hot air). By the late 1850s Lowe had become a foremost balloon builder and continued his lucrative business as a showman giving balloon rides to passersby and funfair attendees.|$|E
25|$|Patterson first played club cricket in Philadelphia for the Germantown Cricket Club. He <b>stood</b> <b>over</b> {{six feet}} tall and was of slim build, batted in good style and bowled right-arm medium-pace. His first {{international}} tour occurred in 1889 {{when he came to}} England with the Gentlemen of Philadelphia. Patterson scored 529 runs, average 40.69, and headed the batting figures for the visitors. He also took 42 wickets at 23 runs each. On this tour, the Philadelphians also stopped in Ireland for a draw against that side. Patterson only scored 38 runs in the match but took 10 wickets. They then proceeded to beat Scotland by ten wickets and the Gentlemen of Hampshire by two runs.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea of an}} {{architectural}} competition to determine {{the design of the}} memorial was favored at the JNEMA's inaugural meeting. They planned to award cash for the best design. In January 1945, the JNEMA officially announced a two-stage design competition that would cost $225,000 to organize. Smith and the JNEMA struggled to raise the funds, garnering only a third of the required total by June 1945. Then mayor Aloys Kaufmann feared that the lack of public support would lead officials to abandon hope in the project. The passage of a year brought little success, and Smith frantically underwrote the remaining $40,000 in May 1946. By June, Smith found others to assume portions of his underwriting, with $17,000 remaining under his sponsorship. In February 1947, the underwriters were compensated, and the fund <b>stood</b> <b>over</b> $231,199.|$|E
25|$|Balanguingui was a {{small island}} with an area of 6 square miles, covered with {{mangroves}} and jungle. The ground was so flat and swampy that when the tide rose, just a few sandbanks remained dry. Four forts <b>stood</b> <b>over</b> these sandbanks, surrounded by some houses built on stilts. A shallow channel divided the island in two portions, also spreading into several branches which penetrated inside the ground, making Balanguingui a swampy maze. The forts were known by the names of Sipac, Balanguingui, Sungap and Bocutingol. The first two were the biggest, and were located {{at the tip of}} the largest estuary. Their walls were built with tree trunks ranging from 2 to 3 feet in diameter and from 18 to 20 in height, and were reinforced by fences and stone embankments.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of Friday, August 24, Rolling broke into the {{apartment}} shared by 17-year-old university freshmen Sonja Larson and Christina Powell. Finding Powell asleep on the downstairs couch, he <b>stood</b> <b>over</b> her briefly but did not wake her up, choosing instead to explore the upstairs bedroom where he found Larson also asleep. Rolling murdered Larson, first taping her mouth shut to stifle her screams and then stabbing her to death. She died while trying to fend him off. Rolling then went back downstairs, taped Powell's mouth shut, bound her wrists together behind her back and threatened her with a knife as he cut her clothes off of her. He then raped her and forced her face-down onto the floor, where he stabbed her five times in the back. Rolling posed the bodies in sexually provocative positions and left the apartment.|$|E
