5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde Spears sitting and {{laughing}} in a bar with two female friends, but stops {{to look at a}} brunette Spears calling out to her on a small stage in front of them, wearing a leather vest, a studded belt, panties and fishnet stockings while sporting a tattoo on her biceps. She dances erotically around a pole and up against a mirror. Throughout the video, she continues to dance and flip her hair while special effects lights flash around her as the camera moves slightly in and out of focus to the beat of the song. The video's light systems change from black and white with aura-like blue and pink hues to full blown color. Around the middle of the video, she is joined by two alter egos of her female friends, who also dance around the pole. The blonde Spears and her friends, while watching the dancing, later draw their attention to an attractive man <b>sitting</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> friends at a table across the bar.|$|E
25|$|Kenneth Ray Carllile (April 2, 1931July 31, 1987), {{better known}} as Thumbs Carllile (Carlisle in some collections), was an {{innovative}} American country music guitarist and songwriter known for his zither-style fingerstyle playing, <b>sitting</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> guitar in his lap while fretting, picking and strumming with his fingers and thumbs. He performed with Little Jimmy Dickens at the Grand Ole Opry in the early 1950s, {{and was a member}} of Roger Miller's band from 1964 to 1972.|$|E
25|$|So-on soon {{sent his}} {{students}} to train with a Rinzai master for a while. Here Shunryu studied {{a very different kind}} of Zen, one that promoted the attainment of satori through the concentration on koans through zazen. Suzuki had problems <b>sitting</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> koan. Meanwhile, all the other boys passed theirs, and he felt isolated. Just before the ceremony marking their departure Suzuki went to the Rinzai teacher and blurted out his answer. The master passed Suzuki; later Shunryu believed he had done it simply to be kind.|$|E

25|$|Peanuts had {{its origin}} in Li'l Folks, a weekly panel comic that {{appeared}} in Schulz's hometown paper, the St. Paul Pioneer Press, from 1947 to 1950. He first used the name Charlie Brown for a character there, although he applied the name in four gags to three different boys and one buried in sand. The series also had a dog that looked much like the early 1950s version of Snoopy. In 1948, Schulz sold a cartoon to The Saturday Evening Post which published 17 single-panel cartoons by Schulz. The first of these was of a boy <b>sitting</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> feet on an ottoman.|$|E
25|$|As Aragorn {{searches}} for Frodo, he suddenly hears Boromir's horn. Aragorn finds Boromir mortally wounded by arrows, <b>sitting</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> {{back against a}} great tree, surrounded by many slain orcs. Before Boromir dies, Aragorn learns that Saruman's Uruk-hai soldiers have kidnapped some of the hobbits, {{in spite of his}} efforts to defend them, that Frodo had vanished after Boromir had attempted to take the Ring from him and that he truly regretted his actions. In his last moments, Boromir charges Aragorn with defending Minas Tirith from Sauron. With Legolas and Gimli, who had been fighting Orcs by themselves, Aragorn pays his last tributes to Boromir and sends him down the Great River Anduin on a funeral boat, the usual methods of burial being impractical. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli later resolve to follow the Uruk-hai captors and save Merry and Pippin.|$|E

[...] Ament said that [...] "Pilate" [...] concerned a question he was asking himself, dealing with a recurring dream Ament had with being old <b>sitting</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> dog on the porch, while [...] "Low Light" [...] was the answer, and that it deals with [...] "a kind of gratefulness at finding that place of calm and peace at my center and getting a glimpse of the person I could choose to be." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the visual}} arts, this fashionable {{intellectual}} melancholy occurs frequently in portraiture of the era, with sitters posed {{in the form}} of [...] "the lover, with his crossed arms and floppy hat over his eyes, and the scholar, <b>sitting</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> head resting on his hand"—descriptions drawn from the frontispiece to the 1638 edition of Burton's Anatomy, which shows just such by-then stock characters. These portraits were often set out of doors where Nature provides [...] "the most suitable background for spiritual contemplation" [...] or in a gloomy interior.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the band}} did not {{originally}} plan {{to release a}} single, EMI issued a radio edit of [...] "I Believe In You" [...] in September 1988 (the previously unreleased [...] "John Cope" [...] was included as the B-side). The single failed to breach the UK Singles Chart Top 75. Around November, Tim Pope directed a music video for [...] "I Believe in You", featuring Hollis <b>sitting</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> guitar, singing the lyrics. [...] "That was a massive mistake," [...] said Hollis. [...] "I thought just by sitting there and listening and really thinking {{about what it was}} about, I could get that in my eyes.

2500|$|During {{his stay}} at Green Bay, Lombardi once {{emerged from his}} office and {{appeared}} before his secretary, Ruth McKloskey, wearing [...] "...all these priest robes on, {{and he had a}} miter with a tassel, everything."

2500|$|The F.B.24C {{was similar}} to the Hispano-Suiza powered aircraft, but was {{slightly}} larger and heavier, and was powered by a 275hp (205kW) Lorraine-Dietrich 8Bd water-cooled V8, with the cylinder blocks being enclosed in bulky fairings that protruded from the upper corners of the cowling, further restricting the pilot's view. The type was tested by the French, and although Vickers claimed good performance, the French found the aircraft's climb performance not as claimed by Vickers, and the type was not adopted. [...] The F.B.24E was an attempt to improve the poor view for the pilot, with the fuselage being raised so that the top was level with the upper wing, and the pilot <b>sitting</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> head protuding through the gap between the two wing spars.|$|E
2500|$|In all {{the three}} scenes where he appears Christ is a youthful, beardless figure with shortish hair (though {{longer than that}} of other figures), which is typical of Christian art at this period. [...] The angel {{standing}} behind Abraham in the Sacrifice of Isaac is depicted similarly, and without wings. [...] Christ appears in the centre of both rows; in the top row as a law-giver or teacher between his chief followers, Peter and Paul (the Traditio Legis), and on the bottom entering Jerusalem. Both scenes borrow from pagan Roman iconography: in [...] the top one Jesus is <b>sitting</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> feet on a billowing cloak representing the sky, carried by Caelus, the classical personification of the heavens. [...] Christ hands Peter a scroll, probably representing the Gospels, as emperors were often shown doing to their heirs, ministers or generals.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{reference}} to the numerical [...] "12th Man" [...] term occurred at the 1922 Dixie Classic, featuring Centre College and The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (later known as Texas A). During the game, A coach Dana X. Bible realized that one more injury would leave him without another backfield player to send into the game. [...] Coach Bible remembered that E. King Gill, an individual who had tried out for the squad but who [...] "lacked the experience and ability {{to play for the}} varsity" [...] had made the trip {{as a member of the}} school's Corps of Cadets and was <b>sitting</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> friends in the stands. [...] Bible sent for Gill and asked for him to suit up and be ready if needed. Gill later said, [...] "I wish I could say that I went in and ran for the winning touchdown, but I did not. I simply stood by in case my team needed me." [...] Although he did not actually play in the game, his readiness to play was noted.|$|E

2500|$|On September 22, 1827, Joseph and Emma took a {{horse and}} {{carriage}} belonging to Joseph Knight, Sr., {{and went to a}} hill now known as the Hill Cumorah where Joseph said he received a set of golden plates. This created a great deal of excitement in the area. In December 1827, the couple decided to move to Harmony, where they reconciled—to some extent—with Isaac and Elizabeth Hale. Emma's parents helped her and Joseph obtain a house and a small farm. Once they settled in, Joseph began work on the Book of Mormon with Emma acting as a scribe. She became a physical witness of the plates, reporting that she felt them through a cloth, traced the pages through the cloth with her fingers, heard the metallic sound they made as she moved them, and felt their weight. She later wrote in an interview with her son, Joseph Smith III: [...] "In writing for your father I frequently wrote day after day, often sitting at the table close by him, he <b>sitting</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> face buried in his hat, with the stone in it, and dictating hour after hour with nothing between us." [...] In Harmony on June 15, 1828, Emma gave birth to her first child—a son named Alvin—who lived only a few hours.|$|E
