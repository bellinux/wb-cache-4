5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} anxiety disorders, especially of panic disorder, but also in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or <b>social</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder.</b> It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E

40|$|International audienceFew {{studies have}} {{examined}} the stability of major psychiatric disorders in pediatric psychiatric clinical populations. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the long-term stability of anxiety diagnoses starting with pre-school age children through adolescence evaluated at multiple time points. Prospective cohort study was conducted of all children and adolescents receiving psychiatric care at all pediatric psychiatric clinics belonging to two catchment areas in Madrid, Spain, between 1 January, 1992 and 30 April, 2006. Patients were selected from among 24, 163 children and adolescents who received psychiatric care. Patients had to have a diagnosis of an ICD- 10 <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> during at least one of the consultations and had to have received psychiatric care for the <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder.</b> We grouped <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> diagnoses according to the following categories: phobic <b>disorders,</b> <b>social</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), stress-related <b>disorders,</b> and “other” <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> which, among others, included generalized <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder,</b> and panic disorder. Complementary indices of diagnostic stability were calculated. As much as 1, 869 subjects were included and had 27, 945 psychiatric/psychological consultations. The stability of all ICD- 10 <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> categories studied was high regardless of the measure of diagnostic stability used. Phobic and <b>social</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> showed the highest diagnostic stability, whereas OCD and “other” <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> showed the lowest diagnostic stability. No significant sex differences were observed on the diagnostic stability of the <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> categories studied. Diagnostic stability measures for phobic, <b>social</b> <b>anxiety,</b> and “other” <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> diagnoses varied depending on the age at first evaluation. In this clinical pediatric outpatient sample it appears that phobic, <b>social</b> <b>anxiety,</b> and stress-related <b>disorder</b> diagnoses in children and adolescents treated in community outpatient services may have high diagnostic stability...|$|R

25|$|To try {{to reduce}} their anxiety and {{alleviate}} depression, people with social phobia may use alcohol or other drugs, {{which can lead to}} substance abuse.

30|$|Moreover, SL {{has been}} used for clinicians or counselors to conduct {{treatments}} or therapies or as a supplement to in-person sessions, with more than 100 groups and institutes offering mental health services through SL in the USA.

Also, with its capability of creating and modifying the intensity of experienced stimuli in a virtually simulated world for clients with different psychological problems (e.g., phobias, <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> eating disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorders) (Gorini and Riva 2008; Parsons and Rizzo 2008; Riva et al. 2007), SL has been reported to be successful in treating some patients.

40|$|Recent {{work has}} linked deficits in reward {{processing}} {{as a potential}} endophenotype for major depressive disorder. Neural and behavioral evidence demonstrated that reduced reward sensitivity is more characteristic of depression than other internalizing psychopathologies such as <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders.</b> However, emerging evidence indicates the presence of reward processing abnormalities across different <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> including generalized and <b>social</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders.</b> Differences across studies may in part {{be due to the}} heterogeneity within <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders.</b> We sought to explore differences in patterns of reward sensitivity across distinct internalizing symptoms dimensions on two laboratory paradigms: social and monetary reward. ERPs were recorded to isolate distinct neural indicators of anticipatory and consummatory reward processing. The results showed that depressive and anhedonic symptomatology were unique predictors of attenuated neural indicators of anticipatory reward sensitivity to uncertain social outcomes (i. e., Stimulus Preceding Negativity) and the early evaluation of social rewards (i. e., Reward Positivity). We also found that neural sensitivity of monetary and social reward was predicted by multiple interrelationships of distinct internalizing symptom dimensions. The results are discussed in the context of previous work on reward processing and psychiatric conditions. The findings underlines the significance of attending to the heterogeneity of reward and symptom dimensions. ...|$|R
