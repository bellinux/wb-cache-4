5000|$|Mikhaylovsky {{regarded}} the historical {{process as a}} progression of social environment differentiation, eventually leading {{to the emergence of}} individuality. The struggle for individuality was seen as a matter of environment adapting to personality, in contrast to the Darwinist notion of struggle for existence, in which an individual adapts to the environment. Criticizing Darwinists for the transference of biological laws onto societal development, Mikhailovsky thought it necessary to expand Darwinism with 1) Karl Ernst von Baer’s law, in compliance with which organisms develop from the simple to the complex, and 2) the <b>solidarity</b> <b>principle,</b> at the base of which lies simple cooperation. Mikhaylovsky saw the utmost criterion of social progress in obtaining the ideal of a perfect, harmoniously developed person. If simple cooperation is a social union of equals with similar interests and functions and [...] "solidarity" [...] as the main attribute of the society in question, in the case of complex cooperation there exists a highly developed division of labor whose major attribute is the [...] "struggle" [...] of interrelated groups. In his view, a society might reach an advanced stage of development and yet belong to the lower type of organization, as, for instance, was the case with European capitalism based on division of labor and complex cooperation. Hence Mikhaylovsky concluded that peasant Russia lagged behind the capitalist West according to the stage of development, but surpassed it if judged by the type of organization. Furthermore, like the majority of nineteenth-century Russian thinkers, he attached particular significance to the obshchina (traditional peasant community), a unique trait distinguishing Russia from other countries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Climate {{change is}} putting {{pressure}} on water systems, and its effects transcend man-made boundaries, making cooperation across territorial borders essential. The governance of transboundary flood risk management calls for solidarity among riparians, as climate change will make river basins more prone to flooding. ‘Solidarity’ means that individuals act to support members of a particular community to which they belong. Recently, the <b>solidarity</b> <b>principle</b> has become institutionalized due to its formalization in the EU Floods Directive. However, {{it is not clear}} what solidarity means in the upstream–downstream practices of transboundary flood risk management. Understanding the meaning of solidarity is important for the development of cross-border climate adaptation governance. This article discusses the conceptualization of the <b>solidarity</b> <b>principle</b> and explores its meaning for international cooperation in the Dutch North Rhine–Westphalian border region. Our critical case study reveals that although all actors understand the importance of solidarity, they interpret it differently, often based on self-interest related to their position in the catchment. The formal inclusion of the <b>solidarity</b> <b>principle</b> in the Floods Directive can best be seen as a step in the continuous development of transboundary flood risk governance, as no striking changes in practice have been identified after its formalization...|$|E

We use data from a factorial survey to test whether the <b>solidarity</b> <b>principles</b> embedded in the recently in Parliament accepted Dutch Compulsory Health Insurance Act match the views of the public as reported in a public opinion survey we held. Each respondent was asked to judge 12 vignettes of fictitious patients. Because of the multilevel structure of the data (1, 597 respondents and 19, 164 fictitious patients) we use an ordinal analysis with a cluster correction for the nesting of the vignette judgements within respondents. The findings show that the public's solidarity with patients appears to be quite high in the Netherlands today. In accordance with the principles as incorporated in the new Act respondents are of the opinion that solidarity should not be a one-way process but based on reciprocity. Respondents are prepared to act solidarly towards patients, but expect in turn that patients are prepared to give a financial contribution to the costs of their treatment.

In particular, ideas of agency, conflict, emancipation and solidarity, which are closely connected with fundamental rights theory and the development of constitutionalism may lose importance. The vulnerability paradigm, rather than eclipsing the language of rights, could then be used to interpret these rights, to define them with increasing accuracy and reinforce their effectiveness.

The present article put forward a qualified differentiation of the ‘term’ solidarity, followed by bringing into question some types of solidarity, as for instance those of the ethic-social, ethic-individual and legal-juridical areas. Debates go on from the points of view of the delicate balance between individual welfare and collective welfare, the moral-social responsibility of social actors, the human dignity, our social (in) competence as well as the time-space dimension.

The extent of non-contributory periods considered in the pension system represents one of the theoretical possibilities of parametric changes to the pension insurance system. The amount of non-contributory periods or the proportion between non-contributory periods and years worked, or the proportion between paid insurance and non-contributory periods (potential loss of insurance contributions) has, to date, merely been estimated in the Czech Republic. The study presents the first accurate figures, based on unique individual data on insured persons.

The “sovereign equality of states” underlying the “international law of coexistence” as well as the “international law of intergovernmental cooperation” must be interpreted in conformity with the universal recognition of human dignity as a source of inalienable human rights. The universal recognition of economic and social human rights further requires taking into account <b>solidarity</b> <b>principles,</b> as proposed also by the sociological approach to international law. The constitutional structures and citizen-oriented functions of the law of international economic organizations liberalizing and regulating mutually beneficial market transactions among citizens require judges to engage in a careful balancing of state-centered and citizen-oriented principles of international law, including respect for the emerging human right to democratic decision-making. This modern “international integration law” and the increasing number of “international constitutional rules” promote the reconciliation of the various state-centered approaches, human rights approaches, sociological approaches and policy-approaches to international law as a system not only of international rules and “legal pluralism” but also of constitutionally limited decision-making processes and struggles for human rights...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} Horace Bushnell (1802 - 1876) rejected the prevalent utilitarian moral philosophy {{of his day}} and developed an alternative moral theory based upon Christian theology and experience. Bushnell claimed that human nature is inherently social, moral experience is interrelated with estrangement and restoration, and Christian piety is a transforming power in the world. Only Christian ethics, not moral philosophy, can be correlated with the mystery of human experience. The study of ethics does not begin with rational principles, norms, or rules elaborated by 2 ̆ 2 moral science, 2 ̆ 2 rather with the human realities of estrangement, moral ambiguity, and innate desire for moral renovation. At the basis of Bushnell 2 ̆ 7 s moral thought is his organic view of human interdependence and the transforming power of moral character. Individuals are social beings, dependent upon God and interdependent in the human community, and their moral development arises from their dependencies. Christian morality {{is a way of}} life or a 2 ̆ 2 life process 2 ̆ 2 that matures through experience. Moral development occurs through one 2 ̆ 7 s dialectical experiences of estrangement and redemption, failure and success, discipline and freedom, reason and inspiration, and work and play. Christian ethics is not a science but an experience; ethics as an activity is a living response to God, others, and the world. Moreover, just as the individual experiences moral tension and estrangement, so does society, through its 2 ̆ 2 organic connection 2 ̆ 2 of sin, encounter social estrangement. Bushnell 2 ̆ 7 s social and political thought is reciprocal to his thought on human nature; both are an ethic of tension. Just as individuals are estranged and incapable of self-redemption, so too society, without religion, is estranged and incapable of moral restoration. Although sin, through its 2 ̆ 2 organic connection, 2 ̆ 2 passes from one generation to the next, this 2 ̆ 2 <b>solidarity</b> <b>principle</b> 2 ̆ 2 can be turned to good by God 2 ̆ 7 s redemption through Jesus Christ. The redemptive power of salvation results in a 2 ̆ 2 moral power, 2 ̆ 2 that coupled with the 2 ̆ 2 <b>solidarity</b> <b>principle,</b> 2 ̆ 2 results in a transformative impulse in society.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: One reason {{given by}} the South African {{government}} for establishing a physician training agreement with Cuba is that the ethical, humanistic and <b>solidarity</b> <b>principles</b> promoted in Cuban medical education are difficult to acquire in other settings. However, Cuba's general medical training program does not provide all skills needed by a general practitioner in South Africa: other competencies are required, such as management of general and gynecological or obstetrical surgical emergencies, administration of anesthesia and nursing procedures. As long as the desired humanistic values were assured, South African authorities have preferred to complement these competencies. Thus, since 2003, the Medical University of Villa Clara has applied a curricular strategy of 12 complementary courses to develop the requested additional skills, but results have not met expectations. OBJECTIVE: Determine why the complementary curricular strategy has not been entirely successful and identify {{possible courses of action}} for improvement. METHODS: A document review was conducted of the curricular strategy applied and of minutes of meetings between Cuban and South African counterparts to identify correspondence between requested professional skills and actions to develop them. In addition, South African students were surveyed and Cuban professors were interviewed in depth. Senior university administrators and key informants were also interviewed. Variables assessed were course quality and satisfaction of students and professors. RESULTS: Some actions originally included in the curricular strategy were not implemented and there were structural weaknesses in complementary courses, primarily in objectives, teaching strategy and evaluation. Students reported insufficient practical activities and lack of relationship between content and the health situation in South Africa. Professors were dissatisfied with student levels of motivation and ability to manage their own learning. Other influencing factors were insufficient academic management and professors' lack of knowledge about the context where these future professionals would eventually practice. CONCLUSIONS: Curricular strategy deficiencies detected are primarily in academic management; overcoming them could facilitate action in specific directions identified to improve the requested skill levels...|$|R

The executive allocates these membership benefits to otherwise removable immigrants who have nonfrivolous labor claims against unscrupulous employers. Why do this?

I argue that screening for migrants who engage in acts of solidarity improves the member-selection process. Allocating membership benefits on this basis helps to identify those migrants {{who are most likely}} to integrate into the mainstream. Central to my claim is the notion that immigration rules tend to favor potential members who possess social and economic bonds with current members. Granting relief to unauthorized workers who are willing to stand in solidarity with their coworkers (especially citizen coworkers) is consistent with this vision of membership. Although the scope of my claim is limited, the <b>solidarity</b> <b>principle</b> can and should inform any efforts to redesign the rules surrounding labor migration...|$|E

Varietal innovation platforms aim to overcome this problem by ensuring that the viewpoints of people involved in assessments are representative of broad interest groups and that assessment results will be validated and disseminated by an organization. Each platform is designed as a sociotechnical scheme consisting of a five-member steering committee (SC), a club with a membership of 25 local users and experts (CLUE), a common varietal test plot and a network of around 15 - 20 on-farm plots. The aim is to describe, evaluate and disseminate improved varieties to target groups of stakeholders faced with the same environmental, agricultural and socioeconomic constraints. Partnerships between all of these stakeholders are set up, organized and managed according to six principles outlined in a charter—legitimacy, competence, efficiency, democracy, solidarity and transparency. Two experimental platforms were set up in the villages of Zé and Tori-Bossito, in southern Benin, to assess plantain varieties released by the Centre africain de recherche sur le bananier et le plantain (CARBAP). These platforms were monitored 20 months following their creation. The survey showed that the two platforms had successfully carried out all of their initially planned activities. The CLUEs identified four interesting varieties. The survey focused on the future plans made by SC and CLUE members to tap the benefits of knowledge acquired during 18 months. It showed that: (i) their plans provided conditions favorable for varietal dissemination and scaling, (ii) SC plans were based on transfer of the platform scheme whereas the CLUE plans were based on varietal dissemination, and (iii) the Tori plan was collective while the Zé plan was more individually focused.
