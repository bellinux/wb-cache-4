As the lake shrank {{numerous}} smaller lakes formed with progressively smaller <b>shorelines.</b> The relict <b>shorelines</b> at elevations of 3100 feet and 3018 feet can be seen mostly easily on Gidikwe Ridge, west of the Boteti River.|$|R
5|$|North of {{downtown}} Port Huron, US25 followed Pine Grove Avenue {{to the eastern}} terminus of M-136 and then followed 24th Avenue out of town. South of Lakeport, the highway changed names to Lakeshore Road and ran along the Lake Huron <b>shoreline</b> in The Thumb region of the state. US25 stayed close to the <b>shoreline</b> and passed Lakeport State Park {{in the town of}} the same name. North of the park, the highway crossed into southern Sanilac County and followed the <b>shoreline</b> to the community of Lexington where it intersected the eastern end of M-90. Further north, the highway intersected the eastern end of M-46 in Port Sanilac.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} ecological zones, {{with their}} progression from <b>shoreline</b> to climax forest, are a classic {{illustration of the}} concept of ecological succession. Much of this progression is due to the changing nature of Presque Isle and its shifting <b>shoreline</b> and dunes. The <b>shoreline,</b> the second zone, is formed by wave action and is in equilibrium between erosion and deposition, with the initial plants stabilizing the sand of the new <b>shoreline.</b> The newly formed sandy plain and the ponds formed in it are the third zone. The ponds start as trapped pockets of lake water and can erode away or be filled by wind-blown sand or drifting dunes. The new ponds provide habitat for plants and animals: for example, the state park is home to 89 species of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and Lepidoptera, including 35 different butterflies, as well as 84 different sorts of spiders.|$|E
5|$|The <b>shoreline</b> of Harveys Lake {{is entirely}} {{surrounded}} by a paved road, which is atypical for a lake <b>shoreline.</b> Homes and cottages are situated on the road opposite the lake, and significant development {{has occurred in the}} vicinity of the lake. A ditch and outlet drainage structure made of concrete at Wardens Place drains into the lake; its purpose is to control small-scale local road flooding.|$|E

These <b>shorelines,</b> however, seem to lack the typical features of <b>shorelines</b> associated with wave and current transport and erosion, such as crescentic embayments, spits, barrier islands, and wave-cut cliffs. Rather, the lakefacing platform edges are commonly rounded and cumulate in planform, often evenly encircling presumed islands. We interpret these <b>shorelines</b> to have been formed by outward growth in a quiescent environment, possibly in ice-covered bodies of water and possibly, in part, as chemical precipitates...|$|R
50|$|Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, and Sevier Lake are {{the largest}} {{remnants}} of the original Lake Bonneville. Several levels of the old <b>shorelines</b> are still visible above Salt Lake City, along the Wasatch Front and elsewhere. The appearance of the <b>shorelines</b> {{is that of a}} shelf or bench protruding from the mountainside, well above the valley floor. Four main <b>shorelines</b> are associated with the fluctuating levels of the ancient lake. The Stansbury, Bonneville, Provo and Gilbert <b>shorelines</b> each mark a time when lake level remained constant long enough to deposit massive accumulations of sand and gravel.|$|R

5|$|At Main Street, Niles Avenue ends, and M-63 joins Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) on Main Street {{into and}} through the {{downtown}} business district. The two highways continue together running concurrently to Ship and Port streets. These two streets form a one-way pair running east to carry BLI-94 to and from a separate bridge over the St. Joseph River. M-63 continues along Main Street across the river into Benton Harbor, Michigan where it follows the Lake Michigan <b>shoreline</b> along a short expressway segment. The trunkline exits Benton Harbor near {{the headquarters of the}} Whirlpool Corporation. North of town, the highway provides access to many lakeshore properties north of Benton Harbor at it continues northeasterly along the <b>shoreline</b> to the community of Lake Michigan Beach. When the highway meets Hagar Shore Road, M-63 turns east along that roadway to an interchange with I-196/US31. The <b>shoreline</b> roadway continues northeast as A-2 (Blue Star Highway) while M-63 terminates at an interchange with I-196/US31. This northernmost segment of the highway had the lowest AADT measurement in 2009 when calculated by MDOT at 2,855vehicles.|$|E

50|$|Concrete seawalls, {{bulkheads}} and revetments {{are examples}} of hardened structures traditionally used to stabilize <b>shorelines</b> that ironically increase erosion rates, reduce the <b>shoreline’s</b> capacity to undergo natural processes and minimize estuarine habitats. NCCF feels that the best approach to battle erosion issues is to plan for erosion to occur and build as distant from the water’s edge as possible. However, when this isn’t possible NCCF supports utilizing stabilization techniques that induce {{the least amount of}} damage to natural ecosystems and uphold the natural structure of the marsh areas. One such approach NCCF takes is advocating for the construction of “living shorelines” when necessary. Living <b>shorelines</b> are new alternatives to stabilize <b>shorelines</b> that utilize organic materials such as oyster reefs, coir fiber logs, wetland plants, stones, sand fill, and submerged aquatic vegetation. Living <b>shorelines</b> protect surrounding intertidal and riparian environments, improve water quality by filtration of runoff, decrease erosion rates and create terrestrial and aquatic habitats.|$|R
50|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{was first}} {{described in the}} late 19th century to explain the <b>shorelines</b> uplifted in Scandinavia due to the removal of large ice massed during the last glaciation. G. K. Gilbert used it to explain the uplifted <b>shorelines</b> of Lake Bonneville.|$|R
500|$|<b>Shorelines</b> lie at altitudes of [...] {{above sea}} level; the {{variation}} is probably caused by slumping, measurement problems, different wave cut and beach deposit thicknesses. The most recent highstand lasted {{long enough to}} allow the formation of well developed <b>shorelines.</b> Fish fossils found off the coastline suggest that lagoons connected to the lake formed there. Fluctuations of the lake level caused the deposition of beach berms. Based on recessional <b>shorelines</b> with distances of slightly over [...] from each other, [...] of depth would have evaporated in about 70 years.|$|R

5000|$|Several {{explanations}} of how Buffalo Knoll, {{and the nearby}} Buffalo Ridges formed. [...] Lake Erie, and the other North American Great Lakes, are products of the geologically recent Laurentian glaciation. The <b>shorelines</b> of the lakes, and the proglacial lakes that preceded them, have fluctuated wildly. The Earth's crust is still slowly rebounding from the extra weight of being covered by kilometers of ice, and this has altered the locations of <b>shorelines.</b> As lobes of the glacier retreated it dammed river valleys that now drain the lakes, which also altered the locations of their <b>shorelines.</b>|$|R
