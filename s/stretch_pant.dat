40|$|The {{effects of}} linings on comfort were {{investigated}} for pleasantness in texture and movement performance in <b>stretch</b> <b>pants.</b> We conducted wearing tests {{in two different}} patterns. At first, comfort of six same <b>stretch</b> <b>pants,</b> five with different lining fabrics and one with no lining, was compared, Then, another waring test was conducted to compare comfort {{in order to obtain}} data on appropriate selection of linings for closer and looser fitting designs, The results were as follows: 1) <b>Stretch</b> <b>pants</b> with linings gained higher evaluation than pants without linings, in terms of pleasantness in texture, slipperiness on the skin and easiness of body movement. The results revealed that the use of lining fabrics improved the comfort of <b>stretch</b> <b>pants.</b> 2) For pants with relatively sufficient ease, it was revealed that the use of supple and smoothsurfaced linings produced more pleasantness to the skin. It was also revealed that easier vertical slipperiness of the lining towards the body deformation improved mobility. Since human body stretches vertically when in action, less vertical friction with the lining yields easier slippage and mobility. 3) For the linings of closer-fitting <b>pants</b> such as <b>stretch</b> <b>pants,</b> we found that elasticity was more effective than slippage on the skin for maintaining mobility...|$|R

50|$|A fabric made of or {{containing}} a polyurethane fiber with elastic properties form-fitting, high-waist <b>stretch</b> <b>pants</b> {{made from a}} heavyweight stretchy material such as spandex, polyester and Lycra were the fabrics of choice during the disco era. Because these fabrics could fit tightly and cling to the body, clothing made of such material {{was very much in}} demand. Bold, dramatic colors and wild, geometric patterns were all the rage. Shiny, light-reflecting fabrics such as satin's and silks as well as gold lamé or sequin-encrusted garments could make the perfect disco statement.|$|R

50|$|They are form-fitting, high-waist unisex <b>stretch</b> <b>pants</b> {{made from}} a heavyweight Nylon/Elastane blend that creates a {{flattering}} slimming effect. They were made famous by Olivia Newton John in 1970s movie Grease but could be seen worn by {{both males and females}} during the period of the late 1970s through the mid 1980s. Male music artists such as Leif Garrett, Shaun Cassidy, the Brothers Johnson, Menudo (band) and John Waite among others wore disco pants during performances. Female music artists including Dottie West, The Nolans, Tina Turner, Kate Bush, The Mandrell Sisters, Sheena Easton, Yuri (Mexican singer), Christie Allen, Crystal Gayle and many others could be seen sporting the pants. Additionally, during this period many actors and actresses could be seen wearing these pants in movies and television shows. Solid Gold (TV series), a weekly American television show about hit music, regularly featured both male and female dancers in disco pants.|$|R
60|$|Whilst the archers were chatting, {{the leaders}} of the army were in solemn {{conclave}} just behind them. Two divisions of the French had been repulsed, and yet there was many an anxious face as the older knights looked across the plain at the unbroken array of the French King moving slowly toward them. The line of the archers was much thinned and shredded. Many knights and squires had been disabled in the long and fierce combat at the hedge. Others, exhausted by want of food, had no strength left and were <b>stretched</b> <b>panting</b> upon the ground. Some were engaged in carrying the wounded to the rear and laying them under the shelter of the trees, whilst others were replacing their broken swords or lances from the weapons of the slain. The Captal de Buch, brave and experienced as he was, frowned darkly and whispered his misgivings to Chandos.|$|R

50|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known of these {{stretchy}} latex pants were introduced by Playtex. Playtex baby <b>pants</b> <b>stretched</b> over the diaper much like rubber gloves are stretched over a hand. Undersized leg holes and waist opening allowed the stretchy latex rubber to seal against the skin to contain diaper wetness and therefore protect what ever the baby was placed upon. Ventilation was supposedly provided by two slots (holes) {{in the front of the}} pants up near the waist but they did little more than allow leakage onto the bed when baby slept on its stomach.|$|R

As part of promotion for [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy"s release as a single, Spears performed it at the 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards and at the 1999 Billboard Music Awards. It was also performed on five concert tours, the first being the ...Baby One More Time Tour (1999). The show began with a dance introduction by Spears' dancers among smoke effects. She appeared shortly after at the top of the staircase wearing a hot pink vinyl tube top and white vinyl pants with pink knee patches. During the 2000 leg of the tour, entitled Crazy 2k Tour, Spears changed the opening sequence of the show; the show started with a skit in which the dancers came out of lockers and stayed in the stage until a bell rang. They all sat until a female teacher voice started calling their names. After the teacher called Spears, she emerged at the top of the staircase in a cloud of smoke, wearing a top and white <b>stretch</b> <b>pants,</b> to perform a short dance mix of [...] "...Baby One More Time". She then entered one of the lockers and appeared in another one on the opposite side of the stage to perform [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy", which included a chair dance sequence referencing Janet Jackson's [...] "Miss You Much" [...] music video that ended with Spears saying [...] "Is that the end?", quoting Jackson's phrase from the video.

40|$|Human {{sensitivity}} to 3 D gross shape changes was measured {{for the visual}} and haptic sensory channels. Three volume-invariant affine transformations were defined: compressing, shearing and <b>stretching.</b> Partici- <b>pants</b> discriminated a reference 3 D object (cube or sphere) from its deformed shape under three experimental conditions: visual only (on a computer monitor), haptic only (through a point-contact force-feedback device) and visuohaptic simulations. The results indicate that vision is more sensitive to gross shape changes than point-based touch, and that vision dominated in the visuohaptic condition. In the haptic alone condition, thresholds were higher for shearing and stretching than for compressing. Thresholds were otherwise sim- ilar for the three transformations in the vision only or visuohaptic conditions. These trends were similar for the two shapes tested. A second experiment, conducted under similar conditions but preventing partic- ipants from manipulating object orientations, verified that the main conclusion of our research still holds when visual inspection can rely only on a single perspective view of the object. Our earlier studies on 3 D visuohaptic watermarking showed that the haptic channel is more sensitive to surface texture and rough- ness changes than vision. The thresholds from the present and our earlier studies can potentially {{be used as the}} upper limits for selecting watermark strengths in order to ensure watermark imperceptibility in a 3 D visuohaptic watermarking system...|$|R
50|$|Daisy's {{clothes were}} {{designed}} by Mary Quant and {{there are hundreds of}} different models. The doll and its accessories were sold in ordinary local shops and children had easy access for their fashination to grow on her.The clothes were cutting edge 70s design, which would be expected of Mary Quant, one of Britains leading fashion designers and inventor of the mini skirt and hot pants. Materials included satin, for long evening gowns and flared <b>pants,</b> <b>stretch</b> jersey nylon/polyester for T-shirts, Fake 'Fun Fur' for jackets and matching hats, and denim for jeans, waiscoats, hats, skirts and even a 'boiler suit' which was very fashionable at the time. Cotton was used extensively for all manner of outfits, long gypsy style dresses, again highly fashionable, blouses, tabbards, mini dresses, etc. And patterns, again, were cutting edge fashion with great use of flowers, stripes and polka dots. Footwear was just as fashionable with platform clogs and sandals in every colour, and Go-Go Boots with the Quant daisy on the side.|$|R
