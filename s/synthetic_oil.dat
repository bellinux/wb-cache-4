5|$|Trough systems {{convert the}} heat from the sun into electricity. Because of their {{parabolic}} shape, trough collectors can focus the sun at 30-60 times its normal intensity on a receiver pipe located along the focal line of the trough. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>oil</b> circulates through the pipe and captures this heat, reaching temperatures of 390°C (735°F). The hot oil is pumped to a generating station and routed through a heat exchanger to produce steam. Finally, electricity is produced in a conventional steam turbine. The SEGS plants operate on natural gas on cloudy days or after dark, and natural gas provides 25% of the total output.|$|E
5|$|Very heavy {{strategic}} bombing by the Allies targeted refineries producing <b>synthetic</b> <b>oil</b> {{and gasoline}} {{as well as}} the German transportation system, especially rail yards and canals. The armaments industry began to break down by September 1944. By November, fuel coal was no longer reaching its destinations and the production of new armaments was no longer possible. Overy argues that the bombing strained the German war economy and forced it to divert up to one-fourth of its manpower and industry into anti-aircraft resources, which very likely shortened the war.|$|E
5|$|An {{elaborate}} bureaucracy {{was created}} to regulate German imports of raw materials and finished goods {{with the intention of}} eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation's balance of payments. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles. As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their <b>synthetic</b> <b>oil</b> plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would {{be turned over to the}} Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.|$|E

5|$|Germany's {{foreign policy}} {{during the war}} {{involved}} the creation of allied governments under direct or indirect control from Berlin. A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies such as Italy and Hungary and millions of workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as Vichy France. By the fall of 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary. When a country was no longer dependable, Germany assumed full control as it did with France in 1942, Italy in 1943 and Hungary in 1944. Although Japan was an official powerful ally, the relationship was distant and there was little co-ordination or co-operation. For example, Germany refused to share their formula for <b>synthetic</b> <b>oil</b> from coal {{until late in the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The oil {{campaign}} over Romania {{and against}} the <b>synthetic</b> <b>oil</b> plants in the Ruhr—in which most oilfields had been destroyed, captured or damaged by 1945—triggered a critical fuel shortage from the autumn of 1944 onwards which denied the Luftwaffe the resources to capitalise on its numerical strength. Paradoxically, production was able to replace the relatively small losses and operational serviceability reached an all-time high since ground crews had more opportunity to work on machines. The Luftwaffe was still capable of taking a toll on Bomber Command on occasion, but unless more powerful radars and communications could be introduced in time it was doubtful British air superiority at night could be challenged. The impotence of the night fighter force as an organisation was demonstrated during the attack on Dresden when the second wave of Allied bombers was hardly opposed. Operation Clarion, launched later that month, was not adequately opposed either.|$|E

A laboratory evaluation has been conducted to quantify the performance advantages of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>oils</b> over mineral oils in hydrodynamic lubrication. The power loss, maximum pad temperature, and oil film thickness in a tilting pad thrust bearing were measured for an ISO VG 32 mineral oil and ISO VG 32 and VG 10 diester based <b>synthetic</b> <b>oils.</b> Results of the tests revealed that the comparable grade mineral and <b>synthetic</b> <b>oils</b> yielded similar bearing power losses and pad temperatures, while the synthetic product developed significantly thicker films. Relative to the VG 32 mineral oil, the VG 10 synthetic lubricant yielded lower bearing power losses and cooler operation, while developing a slightly thicker film. These laboratory test results confirm the field experience that replacement of mineral oil with a suitable grade synthetic lubricant can yield significant economic and technical benefits, including reduction in bearing power losses, without sacrificing machine protection...|$|R
5|$|In September 1941 Japan {{began its}} southward {{expansion}} by expanding its {{military presence in}} Indochina ("securing 'points d'appui'") and decisively {{increased the number of}} stationed personnel and planes. This provoked the United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western governments to freeze Japanese assets, while the US (which supplied 80 percent of Japan's oil) responded by placing a complete oil embargo on the Japanese Empire. As a result, Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in South-East Asia and its prosecution of the war against China, or seizing the natural resources it needed by force. The Japanese military did not consider the former an option as attacking Soviet Russia instead of expanding into South Asia had become a more and more unpopular choice since Japan's humiliating defeat at the Battle of Khalkin Gol in 1939 and the final rejection of any near-term action in Siberia shortly after Germany began its invasion of the USSR. Moreover, many officers considered America's oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war. With the harsh oil sanctions imposed by the United States, the Japanese leadership was now even more determined to remain in China. Germany had refused to sell Japan the blueprints to make <b>synthetic</b> <b>oil,</b> so Japan's only hope for oil was to invade the Dutch East Indies, which would result in war with the United States and Britain. To succeed the Japanese had to neutralize the powerful United States Pacific Fleet, so they could prevent it from interfering with future Japanese movements in South-East Asia and negotiate peace terms from a strong hand.|$|E

25|$|As {{the amount}} of {{territory}} controlled by German forces decreased, the task of Bomber Command became somewhat easier, as more friendly territory was overflown during missions.

This organisation, which drew membership from United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe (USSTAF), the British Air Ministry, and the Ministry of Economic Warfare, evaluated methods of attack and checked data from the continent concerning German oil difficulties.
