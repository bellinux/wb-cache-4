25|$|The Blackhawks {{were eager}} to make a splash in the free-agent market, and offered big money {{to many of the}} top free agents. They were, however, denied, only being able to acquire two backup goaltenders in Patrick Lalime and Sebastien Caron. Chicago {{was one of the biggest}} buyers in the trade market, though, {{acquiring}} a future franchise player in left-winger Martin Havlat, as well as center Bryan Smolinski from the Ottawa Senators in a three-way deal that also involved the San Jose Sharks. The 'Hawks dealt forward Mark Bell to the Sharks, Michal Barinka and a 2008 second-round draft pick to the Senators, while Ottawa also received defenseman Tom Preissing and center Josh Hennessy from San Jose. Havlat gave the Blackhawks the talented, first-line caliber gamebreaker they <b>so</b> <b>desperately</b> needed. The Havlat trade was soon followed by another major trade – winger and key Blackhawk player Kyle Calder was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for grinding defensive center Michal Handzus. The move caused a stir in Chicago; Calder had won an increase in his contract through arbitration, which was accepted by the Hawks, but rather than ink their leading scorer, the Blackhawks decided to address their need for a proven center by acquiring Handzus. Injuries to both Havlat and Handzus hurt the Blackhawks, and Smolinski was eventually traded at the trade deadline to the Vancouver Canucks. On November 26, 2006, Blackhawks General Manager Dale Tallon fired head coach Trent Yawney and appointed assistant coach Denis Savard as the head coach. Savard had been the assistant coach of the Blackhawks since 1997, the year after he retired as one of the most popular and successful Blackhawks players of all time. The Blackhawks continued to struggle, and finished last in the Central Division, 12 points out of the playoffs.|$|E

They too killed their cattle and destroyed their crops. The cult grew and built up momentum, sweeping across the eastern Cape.

500|$|Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy {{gave the}} episode five stars out of five. In his review, {{he states that}} [...] "'The Stolen Earth' does a fine job in weaving {{components}} from the current series, former companions, and Davros together." [...] He wrote that he admires Graeme Harper's direction of the scene where Sarah and Jack receive the continuous [...] "Exterminate!" [...] transmission from the Daleks and stated that [...] "Harper's work ... is worthy of the big screen {{in terms of its}} breathtaking visual elements." [...] He complimented the casting of Michael Brandon as General Sanchez, and expressed hope that Sanchez had survived the Dalek attack because he had the potential to be [...] "the new Brigadier figure that UNIT <b>so</b> <b>desperately</b> needs". Rawson-Jones thought Briggs, as the voice of the Daleks, did a [...] "superb job with Dalek Caan's crazy dialect, stemming from a very inventive and bold move by writer Russell T Davies to make this Dalek go doolally". He praised Bleach's performance as Davros, for his [...] "controlled, sinister vocals" [...] that [...] "wonderfully evoke the brilliant but deranged mindset of the Dalek creator". Upon closing, he commended Davies for being [...] "an expert at delivering jaw-dropping finales that give each season a sense of cohesion and up the stakes to almost unbearable levels", and thought that matching the episode's quality would be a [...] "tough task".|$|E

500|$|Dave Anderson of TV Guide {{called the}} episode first-rate, while praising the comedic Bree storyline and declaring the set-up for the Orson mystery storyline ingenious. He commended Marcia Cross' {{performance}} but opined that Longoria provided the best comedic relief. He also complimented Teri Hatcher's acting, commenting that she [...] "was awesome in the poignant scene where she asks the comatose Mike {{permission to go}} on the (almost) date with Ian." [...] Anderson identified the Scavo storyline as [...] "the weakest link" [...] in the episode and hoped that the Nora and Kayla characters would not remain on the show for too long. TV Guide writer Matt Roush shared similar sentiments regarding the Scavo storyline, stating that while the premiere overall was good, [...] "Lynette is trapped in a story line <b>so</b> <b>desperately</b> unamusing, one that makes her and everyone around her act so idiotic, that you have to pray that we'll soon see the last of the obnoxious Nora, mother of Tom's surprise daughter." [...] He described the storyline as [...] "painfully unpleasant and unfunny." [...] However, Roush praised the performances of Metcalf and Valerie Mahaffey, while concluding that Desperate Housewives [...] "shows encouraging signs of getting its act together." [...] In a separate review, Roush unfavorably compared the Orson character to Bree's former love interest, George Williams (Roger Bart), while also admitting to being [...] "a bit weary" [...] of the Gabrielle storyline.|$|E
500|$|Having just {{repelled}} the Serbian incursion into Bosnia, the Austro-Hungarian Army regrouped {{and positioned}} itself for one final invasion before winter set in. Potiorek was again placed {{in charge of}} Austro-Hungarian forces and was given command of the Austro-Hungarian 6th Army. The Austro-Hungarian 5th Army was commanded by Liborius Ritter von Frank. In total, the Austro-Hungarians had 450,000 troops at their disposal. The Serbian Army had 400,000 soldiers ready to face the Austro-Hungarian advance. In mid-October, the Austro-Hungarians launched another thrust into northwestern Serbia; Potiorek appeared confident. [...] "Soldiers of the 5th and 6th armies," [...] he said. [...] "The goal of this war is nearly attained—the complete destruction of the enemy. The three-month campaign is almost over; we must only break the enemy's last resistance {{before the onset of}} winter." [...] The Serbs were exhausted and demoralized. In a telegram to Putnik dated 27 October 1914, Stepanović complained that the 2nd Army did not have enough shells to resist the Austro-Hungarians effectively and requested that he be removed from his command; Putnik denied the request, but ordered all units to resist the Austro-Hungarian advance {{for as long as possible}} before retreating. This strategy had worked in Putnik's favour during the summer months, but heavy rainfall in September and early October had reduced all of Serbia's roads to [...] "muddy quagmires" [...] that made movement of troops, guns and wagons extremely difficult. Potiorek recognized that the Serbian Army was in a difficult situation; he was certain that a third invasion would bring him the decisive victory that he <b>so</b> <b>desperately</b> wanted. In Vienna and Sarajevo, Austro-Hungarian officials began planning for the occupation and dismantling of Serbia. The country was to be plundered and its territory used to bribe the neutral Balkan states into joining the Central Powers, with the Romanians getting the region of Timočka Krajina and the Bulgarians getting Macedonia and southeastern Serbia. The Austro-Hungarians intended to annex everything west of the Morava River, as well as the cities of Scutari (Shkodër) and Durazzo (Durrës) in northern Albania. The Serbs living west of the Morava—or [...] "the compact masses of the Serbian element", as the Austro-Hungarians called them—were to be expelled and replaced with Austrian settlers (colonisten), who would [...] "change the psychology , making Serbia more Habsburg [...] less Serbian in outlook." [...] Ludwig Thallóczy, section chief of the Austro-Hungarian Finance Ministry, wrote Potiorek in October, recommending [...] "the West Europeanization of the Serbs with a strong hand" [...] as soon as Serbia was occupied.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the source}} of the {{critique}} against jazz was the modernity it implied; in fact, many of the Jazz critics were those who were against any form of modernity.
