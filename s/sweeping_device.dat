Prior to the late sixties, Scottish curling brushes were used primarily {{by some of the}} Scots, as well as by recreational and elderly curlers as a substitute for corn brooms, since the technique was easier to learn. In the late sixties, competitive curlers from Calgary, Alberta, such as John Mayer, Bruce Stewart, and, later, the world junior championship teams skipped by Paul Gowsell, proved that the curling brush could be just as (or more) effective without all the blisters common to corn broom use. During that time period, there was much debate in competitive curling circles as to which <b>sweeping</b> <b>device</b> was more effective: brush or broom. Eventually, the brush won out with the majority of curlers making the switch to the less costly and more efficient brush. Today, brushes have replaced traditional corn brooms at every level of curling; it is rare now to see a curler using a corn broom on a regular basis.|$|E

40|$|TiO 2 {{thin films}} have drawn {{a lot of}} {{attention}} for their application in emerging memory devices, such as resistive random access memory (ReRAM). However, TiO 2 ReRAM still faces reliability issues, including poor endurance, large device-to-device and cycle-to-cycle variability of switching parameters and low yields. Moreover, high electroforming voltages have been often associated with irreversible damage to devices. Doping of TiO 2 has been employed as a strategy for overcoming these issues. Therefore in this work, we used Al as a dopant in TiO 2 thin films to investigate its effect on electroforming and switching voltages of ReRAM devices. Conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) measurements on these thin films, suggested that Al doping decreased the switching voltages compared to the undoped thin films. This result was confirmed by pulse voltage <b>sweeping</b> of ReRAM <b>devices</b> employing the same doped thin films. The Al-doped devices were on average electroforming at - 5. 7 V, compared to - 6. 4 V for the undoped ones, and they were switching with potentials as low as ± 0. 9 V. These findings suggest a potential pathway for implementing low-power ReRAM systems<br/...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{prerequisite}} of accessing white {{spectrum is}} to find and locate it. Our work deals with spectrum detection and recognition {{under the umbrella of}} cognitive radio. In the procedure of spectrum recognition, a frequency <b>sweeping</b> <b>device</b> sweeps the wideband spectrum and the samples of the wideband power spectrum density (PSD) are fed into different Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) sequentially. The core idea of sequential detection or quickest detection is borrowed and utilized here from the classical detection theory. In our proposed approach, forward variables from different HMMs are sequentially exploited to generate the decision statistics. The decision can be made any time as long as the condition is met. The motivation of our work is to detect the availability of spectra and recognize the spectra as quickly as possible and thus shorten the time delay of detection so as to improve the spectrum utilization. The PSDs of Wi-Fi signal, CDMA signal and GSM signal are measured using a Spectrum Analyzer (SA). These acquired data are used to train HMMs beforehand. Meanwhile, a fourth HMM is trained by the PSD of blank spectrum. Experimental results shows this proposed approach is effective. I...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the two stream e-p instability issue in the LANSCE Proton Storage Ring (PSR), a new diagnostic instrument has been developed to measure the electron cloud formation and trapping in a quadrupole magnet at the LANSCE PSR. The device called the Electron Cloud Detector (ECD) was fabricated and has successfully been installed in the PSR. Along with the Electron Cloud Detector, an additional device was developed to manipulate electrons ejected from the quadrupole and allow additional information to be obtained from ECD measurements. This paper will discuss the mechanical design and fabrication issues encountered during the course of developing both devices. ELECTRON CLOUD DETECTOR A diagnostic has been developed to study the electron cloud generation and trapping in a PSR quadrupole [1]. The concept is to measure the electron flux that strikes the beam pipe wall during beam induced multipactoring. The device also features an electrode that can be pulsed after the beam pulse has left the magnet to sweep out any electrons that are trapped in the quadrupole. This is a second generation of an electron <b>sweeping</b> <b>device</b> [2] that had been used in drift spaces in the PSR. This new device will reside within a quadrupole in sector four of the PSR.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the Gilbert damping and the magnetization switching of perpendicularly magnetized FeCoB-based free layers embedded in tunnel junctions adequate for spin-torque operated memories. We study {{the influence of}} the boron content in MgO / FeCoB /Ta systems alloys on their Gilbert damping after crystallization annealing. Increasing the boron content from 20 to 30 % increases the crystallization temperature, thereby postponing the onset of elemental diffusion within the free layer. This reduction of the interdiffusion of the Ta atoms helps maintaining the Gilbert damping at a low level of 0. 009 without any penalty on the anisotropy and the magneto-transport properties up to the 400 ^∘C annealing required in CMOS back-end of line processing. In addition, we show that dual MgO free layers of composition MgO/FeCoB/Ta/FeCoB/MgO have a substantially lower damping than their MgO/FeCoB/Ta counterparts, reaching damping parameters as low as 0. 0039 for a 3 Å thick Tantalum spacer. This confirms that the dominant channel of damping is the presence of Ta impurities within the FeCoB alloy. On optimized tunnel junctions, we then study the duration of the switching events induced by spin-transfer-torque. We focus on the sub-threshold thermally activated switching in optimal applied field conditions. From the electrical signatures of the switching, we infer that once the nucleation has occurred, the reversal proceeds by a domain wall <b>sweeping</b> though the <b>device</b> at a few 10 m/s. The smaller the device, the faster its switching. We present an analytical model to account for our findings. The domain wall velocity is predicted to scale linearly with the current for devices much larger than the wall width. The wall velocity depends on the Bloch domain wall width, such that the devices with the lowest exchange stiffness will be the ones that host the domain walls with the slowest mobilities.

30|$|Semiconductor {{nanowires}} (NWs) and NW-based heterostructures {{are currently}} under extensive research, {{due to the}} unique properties and prominent quantum phenomena emerging from them. For instance, there are numerous reports of NW structures containing quantum dots, which can act as efficient sources of single photons or entangled photon pairs [1 – 5]. Another application area where NW arrays attract wide interest is in next-generation cost-effective and high-efficiency photovoltaic (PV) devices, based on two main reasons: first, their relaxed lattice-matching requirements, due to easy strain accommodation at the NW free surface, providing flexibility in substrate selection and band-gap engineering. Second, the possibility for lesser material utilization, due to enhanced light absorption in NW arrays, based on their inherent anti-reflecting properties [6], increased light trapping within the array [7], and resonant wave-guiding properties [8]. Recently, a single-junction solar cell based on InP NWs [9] with an efficiency η[*]≈[*] 13.8  % and a single GaAs NW PV device [10] with η[*]≈[*] 40  % have been reported, showing the real potential of NW solar cells to compete directly with other thin-film solar cell technologies. Another direction worth exploring for NW solar cells is the possibility to utilize piezoelectric (PZ) fields present in strained NW heterostructures, {{in order to obtain}} enhanced NW-based PV devices. As first estimated by Boxberg et al. [11], a significant axial PZ field of 60 – 80  kV/cm can develop in InAs/InP core-shell NWs, which can be used for efficient carrier <b>sweeping</b> towards the <b>device</b> electrodes. As we have recently shown in [12], axial PZ fields of the order of 7 – 8  kV/cm may even exist in core-shell GaAs/AlGaAs NWs, having a very small lattice mismatch of 0.05  %. Such fields are already significant for the operation of a PV device and should be taken into account in any related device work. In this work, we report on the preliminary results of the growth and characterization of strained core-shell GaAs/InGaAs NWs, a NW heterostructure which is expected to exhibit pronounced PZ effects.|$|R
