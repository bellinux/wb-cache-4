40|$|The {{functionalization}} of carbon-hydrogen {{bonds in}} non-nucleophilic substrates using α-carbonyl <b>sulfoxonium</b> <b>ylides</b> {{has not been}} so far investigated, despite the potential safety advantages that those reagents would provide over diazo compounds or their in situ precursors. We describe the cross-coupling reactions of <b>sulfoxonium</b> <b>ylides</b> with C(sp 2) -H bond of arenes and heteroarenes {{in the presence of}} a rhodium catalyst. The reaction proceeds by a succession of C-H activation, migratory insertion of the ylide into the carbon-metal bond and protonation, the last step being turnover-limiting. The method is applied to the synthesis of benz[c]acridines when allied to an iridium-catalyzed dehydrative cyclization...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} new results {{obtained}} in our investigations of Rh-catalyzed C 1 (co) polymerization reactions using carbene units as monomers. We demonstrate here, {{for the first}} time, the use of transition metal catalysts in carbene polymerization using sulfur ylides as the carbene monomer precursors. Furthermore, we show {{that it is possible}} to generate unique diblock copolymers from <b>sulfoxonium</b> <b>ylides</b> and diazoesters as the respective carbene monomer precursors. This constitutes an entirely new approach to the synthesis of functional copolymers. The copolymerization reactions were successful, and high-Mw poly(methylene) -poly(ester carbene) copolymers were obtained with a diblock-syndiotactic microstructure in decent yields. These copolymers can be used as blending agents to mix polyethylene or polymethylene with poly(ethyl 2 -ylidene-acetate). The copolymer properties are highly dependent on the functional-group content. Model studies and investigations on the influence of the catalyst structure on the obtained polymer yields provide insights into the catalyst activation and deactivation processes operative under the applied reaction conditions...|$|E
40|$|My {{dissertation}} includes five {{research projects}} on the polyhomologation reaction for synthesis of carbon backbone polymers. In chapter 1, an overview is provided on the polyhomologation reaction. The reaction builds linear sp 3 carbon chains one carbon {{at a time}} using an organoborane catalyst. The traditional method is a living polymerization using <b>sulfoxonium</b> <b>ylides</b> under anhydrous conditions. The newly developed aqueous method is a polymerization of sulfoxonium salts in an aqueous base. Chapter 2 develops the synthesis of telechelic polymers including ω-hydroxyacid esters, α,ω-diols and α,ω-diacids using the aqueous polyhomologation reaction with control of chain length and PDI. These polymers were used as macromonomers to produce long-chain aliphatic polyesters. The obtained polyesters have thermal and mechanical properties indistinguishable compared to related materials derived from biomass. Chapter 3 reports the synthesis of a gradient ersatz ethylene–propylene copolymer using the traditional polyhomologation reaction. A new and convenient source of the ethylide monomer was developed for the introduction of methyl branch on the polymer backbone. The gradient copolymer contains a gradual change of methyl branch content along the polymer chain. Chapter 4 focuses on the precise monomer insertion on a carbon chain using a sulfonium benzylide. The polymerization and validation protocols were established to demonstrate the precise insertion. A thermally more stable benzylide needs to be developed to complete this study. In chapter 5, three 9 -borafluorene derivatives are designed and evaluated {{in search of a}} single-site catalyst for the polyhomologation reaction. The catalyst is being developed for the synthesis of the yet unknown polyethylidene. Computational studies indicated a preferred 1, 2 -migration of the sp 3 over sp 2 carbon when an electron-withdrawing group is installed on the aromatic rings at the ortho position to boron. Experimental studies revealed the presence of competing sp 2 carbon migration due to the required high reaction temperature from the high activation energy of 1, 2 -migration. A side reaction produced ethylidene–methylidene copolymers rather than polyethylidene due to the competing decomposition of ethylide. In chapter 6, an air-stable borane initiator was provided for convenient use in the polyhomologation reaction. Polymer molecular weight and polydispersity are well controlled using the amine–borane complex...|$|E
