Broadheath's industrial area, covering about , was founded in 1885 by Harry Grey, 8th Earl of Stamford, to attract businesses. By 1900 Broadheath had its own docks, warehouses and electricity generating station. The site's proximity to rail, canal and road links proved attractive to companies making machine tools, cameras and grinding machines.

The percentage change in the grain sizes was quantified and correlation to the microhardness values was established. The Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) of the materials was also quantified using the obtained hardness values. The investigations revealed that the <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> causes an increase in the Vickers microhardness values of all the materials which also led to an increase in the UTS.

40|$|Exposure data on {{biocides}} {{are relatively}} rare in published literature, especially for secondary exposure. This {{is also the}} case for antifouling exposure. Therefore, a field study was carried out measuring exposure to antifouling paints. Both primary exposure (rolling and spraying) and secondary exposure (during <b>sand</b> <b>blasting)</b> were studied. Exposure during rolling was measured in boatyards where paints containing dichlofluanid (DCF) were applied. Spraying was measured in dockyards (larger than boatyards) where paints containing copper were applied. Furthermore, during <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> the removal of old paint layers containing copper was measured. A total of 54 datasets was collected, both for inhalation and dermal exposure data. For paint and stripped paint bulk analyses were performed. The following values are all arithmetic means of the datasets. Inhalation of copper amounted to 3 mg m- 3 during spraying and to 0. 8 mg m- 3 during <b>sand</b> <b>blasting.</b> Potential body exposure loading amounted to 272 mg h- 1 copper during spraying and 33 mg h- 1 during <b>sand</b> <b>blasting.</b> For dichlofluanid the inhalation exposure loading was 0. 14 mg m- 3 during rolling, whereas the potential body exposure loading was 267 mg h- 1 and potential hand exposure loading 277 mg h- 1. The results for primary exposure compare well to the very few public data available. For the secondary exposure (<b>sand</b> <b>blasting)</b> no comparable data were available. The present study shows that the exposure loading should be considered more extensively, including applicable protective gear. In this light the findings for the potmen during <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> suggest that personal protective equipment should be (re) considered carefully. © The Author 2006.

40|$|AbstractThe aim {{of present}} {{research}} was to study the effect of some surface modification processes on wettability of Ti 6 Al 4 V surfaces for medical implants quantified by using the measurement of contact angle. The surface modification procedures of several disc samples were performed by <b>sand</b> <b>blasting,</b> acid etching, passivation, and their combinations. <b>Sand</b> <b>blasting</b> was done with 250 [...] . 300 μm SiO 2 large grits. The acid etching process was performed in a dual bath of H 2 SO 4 1 n and HCl 1 n (1 : 1) at different elevated temperatures (60 °C, 80 °C, and 100 °C) using different process durations (1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h). Passivation was done in 30 % HNO 3 at room temperature. On modified surfaces we evaluated topography, by measuring roughness, and analyzing scanning electron micrographs. Contact angle was measured using static method and direct measurement of the tangent angle at the three-phase contact point on a sessile drop proﬁle. We found that the influence of <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> prior to acid etching at low temperature (60 °C) on contact angle is beneficial when using long acid etching times (12 h and 24 h). Increasing the process time for acid etching leads to a decrease in contact angle which is a desired result. Increasing the temperature of acid etching bath leads {{to an increase in}} contact angle, thus decreasing the wettability. The passivation treatment leads to an increase of contact angle on <b>sand</b> <b>blasted</b> surfaces, lowering the hydrophilic properties of surfaces, and does not influence significantly the contact angle on surface without <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> treatment. The best preparation procedure, in terms of wettability measured by contact angle, was found to be <b>sand</b> <b>blasting,</b> followed by acid etching in above mentioned dual acid bath at 60 °C for 24 hours. In this case we measured a contact angle of 46 ° showing good hydrophilic properties...|$|R

40|$|The present work {{is based}} on a {{simulation}} in laboratory of the erosion of a soda lime glass caused by <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> during sandstorms. It deals with the effects of <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> duration (from 0 to 60 min) and impact angle (from 0 to 90 °) on the material and its properties. The principal erosion characteristics and properties of the material studied are the mass loss, the erosion rate, the surface roughness, the optical transmission and the mechanical strength. The influence of the optical transmission degradation on the relative efficiency of solar panels protected by eroded glass was also examined. The sand used has mostly a rounded shape and presents a grain size distribution between 300 and 500 µm and hardness greater than that of the glass tested. The evolution of the roughness and the optical transmission with variable duration present an important variation at the beginning and tends towards a constant level after about 20 minutes. The mass loss is function of the <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> duration and the impact angle. It is maximal for an impact angle of 90 °. Fracture strength (up to 300 min) indicates that there is an important drop in strength values (about 13 %) after 30 minutes with a significant dispersion. The strength values tend then to level out with a reduced dispersion after 60 minutes. Weibull distribution function was used to characterize statistically the variation of the mechanical strength by comparing samples in the as received state and eroded by <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> during 30 and 60 minutes. The as received glass Weibull plot shows a large dispersion expressed by a low Weibull modulus (m = 5. 41) and a relatively higher average strength value (smoy = 76 MPa). A lesser dispersion and a lower average strength value were obtained for the glass eroded during 30 minutes (m = 8. 2 and smoy = 66 MPa). The average strength remains almost constant while the dispersion becomes much reduced for the glass <b>sand</b> <b>blasted</b> during 60 minutes (m = 10. 4 and smoy = 64 MPa). The variation of the relative efficiency of glass protected solar panels versus <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> duration (seen up to 300 min) shows a slow regular decrease until 0. 91 for a 90 ° impact angle and until 0. 95 for 30 °.

40|$|Recently, wet <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> on coated {{cutting tool}} inserts has drawn {{interest}} to the tooling industry due to its positive effects on cutting performance and tool life. This performance boost has partly been attributed to the buildup of compressive residual stresses in the coating during the blasting process. However, the mechanism of forming residual stresses in ceramic coatings during <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> is not fully understood. This work utilize x-ray diffraction as the main tool to study the formation and relaxation of residual stresses after wet <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> and annealing on 001, 012 and 110 textured α-Al 2 O 3 coatings. To minimize the influence of stress gradients in the samples, all stress measurements were set up with a fixed analysis depth of 2 µm. <b>Sand</b> <b>blasting</b> was made with an alumina based slurry at 2, 3. 2 and 4 bar pressure and the anneal was done at temperatures from 400 to 1000 °C for 2 hours or more. The coating hardness was evaluated by nanoindentation. Finally, the activation energy for the relaxation of residual stresses was estimated using the Zener-Wert-Avrami function. The results reveal the highest compressive residual stress with up to - 5. 3 GPa for the 012 texture while the stresses for the 001 and 110 textures peaked at - 3. 1 and - 2. 0 GPa, respectively. Further, a hardness gradient was present after blasting of the 001 and 012 textured samples indicating a higher stress at {{the surface of the}} coating. The 110 textured sample is the most brittle resulting in flaking of the coating during <b>sand</b> <b>blasting.</b> The different deformation mechanisms are related to difference in active slip planes between coatings with different textures. Both the stress and hardness decreased after heat treatment and the activation energy for stress relaxation was found to be as 1. 1 ± 0. 3 eV, 1. 9 ± 0. 2 eV and 1. 2 ± 0. 1 eV for the 001, 012 and 110 textures, respectively...|$|R
