25|$|As {{the deal}} {{worked its way}} through state and federal {{regulatory}} approval, Dynegy took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced its debt. The company obtained $1.3 billion in term loan B facilities and $500 million in revolving credit. The company used this income to retire an $800 million, seven-year line of credit and a $500 million, two-year line of credit. Dynegy agreed that the revolving credit line would be paid off and terminate within five years. Two <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> made up the $1.3 billion loan package. The $800 million loan and the $500 million loan were both due in 2020. This left Dynegy with $1.28 billion in lines of credit and $500 million in outstanding bonds.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{management}} involves {{analyzing the}} market and credit risk that an investment bank or its clients take onto their balance sheet during transactions or trades. Credit risk focuses around capital markets activities, such as <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans,</b> bond issuance, restructuring, and leveraged finance. Market risk conducts review of sales and trading activities utilizing the VaR model and provide hedge-fund solutions to portfolio managers. Other risk groups include country risk, operational risk, and counterparty risks {{which may or may}} not exist on a bank to bank basis. Credit risk solutions are key part of capital market transactions, involving debt structuring, exit financing, loan amendment, project finance, leveraged buy-outs, and sometimes portfolio hedging. Front office market risk activities provide service to investors via derivative solutions, portfolio management, portfolio consulting, and risk advisory. Well-known risk groups in JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Barclays engage in revenue-generating activities involving debt structuring, restructuring, <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans,</b> and securitization for clients such as corporates, governments, and hedge funds. J.P. Morgan IB Risk works with investment banking to execute transactions and advise investors, although its Finance & Operation risk groups focus on middle office functions involving internal, non-revenue generating, operational risk controls. Credit default swap, for instance, is a famous credit risk hedging solution for clients invented by J.P. Morgan's Blythe Masters during the 1990s. The Loan Risk Solutions group within Barclays' investment banking division and Risk Management and Financing group housed in Goldman Sach's securities division are client-driven franchises. However, risk management groups such as operational risk, internal risk control, and legal risk are restrained to internal business functions including firm balance-sheet risk analysis and assigning trading cap that are independent of client needs, even though these groups may be responsible for deal approval that directly affects capital market activities. Risk management is a broad area, and like research, its roles can be client-facing or internal.|$|E

40|$|In this study, I {{examine the}} {{characteristics}} of U. S. corporate borrowers (public debt, private placement, and <b>syndicated</b> <b>loan</b> firms) in HOT versus COLD equity markets. My main objective is to see {{the characteristics of}} firms that choose debt financing even when the equity market is HOT. HOT equity markets are defined as the top {{twenty percent of the}} months in terms of the de-trended number of equity offerings. I find that the HOT equity market borrowers generally have higher market-to-book ratios compared to the COLD market borrowers. Also, in HOT equity markets, the public debt firms (i. e. the corporate bond issuers) tend to have fewer tangible assets, the private placement firms tend to be smaller and highly levered, and the <b>syndicated</b> <b>loan</b> firms tend to be smaller, more profitable, and less levered compared to the COLD market firms. When I {{look at the number of}} transactions in each market, I find that when the equity market is active (i. e. HOT), the <b>syndicated</b> <b>loan</b> market is even more active. During these periods, the public debt market is also active (although not as much as the equity or the <b>syndicated</b> <b>loan</b> markets). When I look at the sizes of the transactions in each market, I find that the private placements tend to be significantly larger in HOT markets compared to COLD markets. I conclude that while the equity, the public debt, and the <b>syndicated</b> <b>loan</b> markets move together in terms of market activity, the equity market and the private placement markets move together in terms of the size of the transaction. ...|$|R
