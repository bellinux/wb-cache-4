5|$|Lawless {{struggled}} with multiple injuries during the 2014–15 season, making 15 league appearances (only six {{of which were}} <b>starts)</b> <b>and</b> scoring three goals.

5|$|Baroš {{scored in}} Lyon's opening {{game of the}} 2007–08 season as his club won 2–0 against Auxerre. However, he played {{significantly}} less under new manager Alain Perrin, making just six <b>starts</b> <b>and</b> scoring {{a total of three}} league goals. In mid-November, Baroš revealed a break down in his relationship with Perrin and hinted at a move to another club.|$|E
5|$|Borislow's most {{successful}} horse was Toccet, who won four graded stakes, including the Champagne and Hollywood Futurity in 2002. Toccet's {{name is a}} misspelled tribute to former National Hockey League (NHL) player Rick Tocchet. The horse was named runner-up to Vindication for the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt in 2002, {{a part of the}} Eclipse Award. Once a favorite to enter the 2003 Kentucky Derby, Toccet was derailed by ankle injuries early in the year. He won one listed stakes after his juvenile season out of 15 <b>starts</b> <b>and</b> now stands at Castleton Lyons.|$|E
5|$|Boyd spent 30 months {{writing the}} novel. The journal style, with its gaps, false <b>starts</b> <b>and</b> contradictions, {{reinforces}} {{the theme of}} the changing self in the novel. Many plot points simply fade away. The novel received mixed reviews from critics on publication, but has sold well. A television adaptation was made with the screenplay written by Boyd, first broadcast in 2010.|$|E

5|$|In {{the absence}} of the resting Bradman, Hassett won the toss and elected to bat. Attendance was 17,000 {{on the first day of}} this two-day non-first-class match. Rain {{prevented}} any play on the second day. After a poor start that saw them fall to 22/3, McCool (64) and Miller (55) made half-centuries for the Australians. Many of the Australians made <b>starts</b> <b>and</b> six scores passed 20, but none went on. Paceman Keith Jackson took 5/76 for the hosts. Five Australian bowlers each took one wicket and Jackson top-scored with 23 before rain ended the match.|$|E

They must plan a food drop, camp away from checkpoints, and carry much of the same equipment as mushers in the Yukon Quest and Yukon Quest 300.|$|E
5|$|The first Giro d'Italia {{was a great}} success, {{prompting}} organizers {{to arrange}} a second one for 1910.
