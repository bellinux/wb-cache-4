Overall heating load reduction due to the <b>storm</b> <b>windows</b> was 13 percent with the clear glass and 21 percent with the low-e windows.

When Captain Picard asks for suggestions on how to locate Geordi, Wesley Crusher offers the idea of launching a probe onto the planet's surface that would send a neutrino signal that could be detected by La Forge's VISOR, lead him to the probe, and allow him to use it to signal he is all right and able to return to the ship during the next <b>storm</b> <b>window.</b> As they launch and monitor the probe, the Enterprise detects a communication from Romulan Commander Tomalak. When they hail him to inform him that the Romulans violated the treaty by entering Federation space, he brushes it off as a misunderstanding and explains that the craft went off course due to a malfunction. Picard informs him that they found a survivor, and after getting assurances that the crashed craft only had the one occupant, agrees to meet Tomalak at the Neutral Zone to deliver the survivor. Several crew members suggested a more aggressive response, but Picard warns his crew that they must handle the situation delicately to avoid setting off another war between the Federation and Romulan Empire.|$|E

40|$|During {{rehabilitation}} of historic buildings, {{the question of}} how to treat the windows is inevitably raised. The desire to retain the historic character of the windows and the actual historic material of which the windows are made is seen as competing with the desire to improve energy performance and decrease long term window maintenance costs. Replacement of window sash, the use of windows inserted inside existing jambs or whole window replacement is often advocated in the name of energy efficiency, long term maintenance cost reduction, ease of operation, and better assurance of window longevity. Other approaches to improve the energy efficiency of historic windows retain all or part of the existing sash and balance system and typically include exterior triple-track <b>storm</b> <b>window</b> rehabilitation or replacement. Some building renovations only include <b>storm</b> <b>window</b> repair or replacement and prime window maintenance. To date there is little data quantifying the impact on annual heating costs of these varied upgrade options or comparing estimated first year energy savings to installed costs. This study was undertaken to test the assumption that historic windows can be retained and upgraded to approach the thermal efficiency of replacement sash or window inserts...|$|E

Prime/low-E <b>storm</b> <b>window</b> combinations performed very similarly to the replacement window. Interestingly, solar heat gain was not negligible, even in north-facing orientation...|$|E
