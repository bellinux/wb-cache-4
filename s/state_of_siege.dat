5|$|On January 3, 1894, Crispi {{declared}} a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>siege</b> throughout Sicily. Army reservists were recalled and General Roberto Morra di Lavriano was dispatched with 40,000 troops. The old order was restored {{through the use}} of extreme force, including summary executions. The Fasci were outlawed, the army and the police killed scores of protesters, and wounded hundreds. Thousands of militants, including all the leaders, were put in jail or sent into internal exile. Some 1,000 persons were deported to the penal islands without trial. All working-class societies and cooperatives were dissolved and the freedom of the press, meeting and association were suspended. A solidarity revolt of anarchists and republicans in the Lunigiana was crushed as well. The government also seized the opportunity to 'revise' the electoral registers. In Catania 5,000 of the 9,000 electors were struck off.|$|E
5|$|These {{rapid changes}} raised {{tensions}} between officers and their charges, and over thirty sailors {{were arrested in}} early December and accused of planning a new rebellion—which led to that feared second rebellion. On 9 December, crewmen onboard Rio Grande do Sul, {{the only one of}} Brazil's major new warships to not take part in the Revolt of the Lash, mutinied but did not gain enough traction to take the ship. Shortly after, the marine infantry battalion at the naval facilities on Ilha das Cobras revolted. The government acted quickly and put down both rebellions, but they caused the Brazilian Congress to declare that Rio de Janeiro was in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>siege,</b> thereby giving President Fonseca a suite of tools to combat the unrest. The vote was nearly unanimous; the only vote against came from Rui Barbosa.|$|E
5|$|Jerusalem {{had been}} well-fortified after Heraclius recaptured {{it from the}} Persians. After the Byzantine defeat at Yarmouk, the Patriarch of Jerusalem Sophronius {{repaired}} its defenses. The Muslims had so far not attempted any siege of the city. However, since 634, Saracen forces {{had the potential to}} threaten all routes to the city. Although it was not encircled, it had been in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>siege</b> since the Muslims captured the neighboring forts of Pella and Bosra. After the Battle of Yarmouk, the city was severed from the rest of Syria, and was presumably being prepared for a siege that seemed inevitable. When the Muslim army reached Jericho, Sophronius collected all the holy relics including the True Cross, and secretly sent them to the coast, to be taken to Constantinople. The Muslim troops besieged the city some time in November 636. Instead of relentless assaults on the city, they decided to press on with the siege until the Byzantines ran short of supplies and a bloodless surrender could be negotiated.|$|E

However, the following period was to prove a highly problematic one for the country at large, marked by violent incidents and a succession <b>of</b> decreed <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>siege.</b> The first truly representative Parliament was split over the question of land reform, with the PȚ advocating more profound changes than the one promised in 1917.

60|$|The year rolled on, an {{agitated}} year {{of general}} revolution.

And sometimes he brought a companion, generally Mr. Wilton, and sometimes they met Lady Montfort or Adriana, now ennobled as the daughter of Lord Hainault. There was much to talk about, even if they did not talk about themselves and their friends, for every day brought great events, fresh insurrections, new constitutions, changes of dynasties, assassinations <b>of</b> ministers, <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>siege,</b> evanescent empires, and premature republics.|$|R

40|$|This {{transnational}} {{collection of}} essays, interviews, and creative {{pieces on the}} 1982 <b>Siege</b> <b>of</b> Beirut explores literary representations <b>of</b> the <b>siege</b> by a diverse set of writers alongside journalism and other media including film and art. The book investigates and promotes an awareness of an ethics of representation on questions of extreme emotional investment, comparing representations <b>of</b> the <b>siege</b> to representations <b>of</b> other traumatic events, visiting responses from those of different cultural backgrounds to the same event and considering implications with respect to comparative approaches. Chapters explore how literature, journalism and art contribute to overcoming the dangers of forgetting and denial, memorial excess and fundamentalism, the radicalization of violence, and the complete breakdown of trust on international levels, asking how they challenge geopolitical, intellectual, and psychological <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>siege</b> and instead promote awareness, acknowledgement, mourning, and justice across divided communities. The book extends the use of postcolonial methodologies affiliated with history, international relations, and psychoanalysis (memory, trauma) to Middle-Eastern studies, and visits the siege’s effect on different forms of memory and memorialization: selective memory, trauma, gaps and fissures in historical accounts, recording of eyewitness reports, and artistic re-imaginings and realizations of alternative archives...|$|R
60|$|These {{aspects of}} aerial {{fighting}} took {{the world by}} surprise. There had been no foresight to deduce these consequences. If there had been, the world would have arranged for a Universal Peace Conference in 1900. But mechanical invention had gone faster than intellectual and social organisation, and the world, with its silly old flags, its silly unmeaning tradition of nationality, its cheap newspapers and cheaper passions and imperialisms, its base commercial motives and habitual insincerities and vulgarities, its race lies and conflicts, was taken by surprise. Once the war began there was no stopping it. The flimsy fabric of credit that had grown with no man foreseeing, and that had held those hundreds of millions in an economic interdependence that no man clearly understood, dissolved in panic. Everywhere went the airships dropping bombs, destroying any hope of a rally, and everywhere below were economic catastrophe, starving workless people, rioting, and social disorder. Whatever constructive guiding intelligence there had been among the nations vanished in the passionate stresses of the time. Such newspapers and documents and histories as survive from this period all tell one universal story of towns and cities with the food supply interrupted and their streets congested with starving unemployed; of crises in administration and <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>siege,</b> <b>of</b> provisional Governments and Councils of Defence, and, {{in the cases of}} India and Egypt, insurrectionary committees taking charge of the re-arming of the population, of the making of batteries and gun-pits, of the vehement manufacture of airships and flying-machines.|$|R

40|$|We examine two complex {{aspects of}} the {{problematic}} intrusion of political and ideological imperatives upon the world of libraries and books: 1) Materials selection, freedom to read, and censorship. We suggest that choices of library materials are linked to policies of lay and religious leaders who tend to prohibit, on one hand, works which are considered hostile to the government and, on the other, items deemed contrary to church religious ideology. 2) Elimination, destruction, and out-and-out <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>siege,</b> in which acts of suppression (of books) and annihilation (of books and of libraries themselves) arise from policies that endanger the public order. Thus through a theoretical-historical analysis, we discern the ideological role of such instruments and cultural systems, and the ideological power they exert within {{the structure of the}} society and the state. We explain that under certain social and political circumstances, these cultural assets are subject to varying degrees of systematic repression that range from comparatively tenuous measures of circumscription, to destructive mechanisms that operate on a grand scale. We conclude that the phenomenon of elimination and destruction of library collections and libraries, whether through violent sieges or by means of civil repression, should be regarded from a perspective that calls for justice and reprisal, because these devastating events constitute crimes against culture...|$|R

25|$|However, {{there was}} still the thorny problem of {{deciding}} {{whether or not to}} move the provincial capital. The dilemma was caused by events related to the Philippine–American War. First, Nueva Ecija had been a hotbed of resistance against the American Occupation, and was therefore in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>siege.</b> Four of its towns, Balungao, Rosales, San Quentin and Umingan, which were further away from the capital and already considered pacified by US forces, had been annexed to the province of Pangasinan.|$|E

25|$|The revolt {{started when}} on January 13, 1894, with a {{demonstration}} {{against the government}} crackdown of the Fasci Siciliani a popular movement of democratic and socialist inspiration in 1891–1894 on Sicily, who had risen up against the ever-increasing taxes on the prices of basic commodities, such as bread, and for land reform.

25|$|By the {{following}} morning the city of Carrara was surrounded by soldiers {{under the command of}} General Nicola Heusch.

Instead of going to work, they came down from the mountains and gathered around the military barracks where hundreds of prisoners had already been detained. Troops were then ordered to amass and, as soon as the crowd came near enough, they fired. Eleven deaths resulted, as well as numerous other casualties. (Other sources mention 8 people killed and 13 wounded). Armed bands dispersed into the mountains pursued by troops.|$|E

40|$|The Painter of Bridges is {{a hybrid}} siege-exile {{novel about a}} {{landscape}} painter, Zora Buka, who loses her life’s work in a fire during the <b>siege</b> <b>of</b> Sarajevo. Part One, presented in the creative paper, is set in Sarajevo and depicts Zora’s experience of the first ten months <b>of</b> the <b>siege.</b> Part Two is set in England: Zora recollects her escape from Sarajevo, and waits for her asylum claim to be accepted. The novel is therefore concerned with portraying the exceptional <b>states</b> <b>of</b> life under <b>siege</b> and <b>of</b> being a refugee. The critical paper shares these concerns and follows {{the movement of the}} novel from siege to exile. Beginning with a discussion <b>of</b> the <b>siege</b> in post-war literature, the critical section then looks at the double figure <b>of</b> the <b>siege</b> in Camus’s The Plague, before turning to themes <b>of</b> <b>siege</b> and exile in Susan Sontag’s 1993 Sarajevo production of Beckett’s Waiting for Godot. It finally examines Slavenka Drakulić’s representation of the refugee in her Bosnian war novel, As If I Am Not There. The critical paper thus offers close readings of two war novels and a wartime theatrical production. These texts are seen as ‘works of exception’ which illuminate the liminal spaces that Giorgio Agamben terms ‘zones of indistinction’. The readings of The Plague and Waiting for Godot draw on Agamben's theory of modern life to analyse their depictions of the refugee and the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> exception. Postcolonial questions about the representation of others, meanwhile, are addressed in the second reading of The Plague, where, going against much postcolonial criticism, it is argued a hidden allegory of anticolonial uprising is at work, and again in As If I Am Not There, where the uprooted, violated protagonist is found to have an ethically and artistically flawed doubled consciousness...|$|R
