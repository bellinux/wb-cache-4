40|$|Abstract. The brittleness, plasticity, super-plasticity and {{the removal}} {{mechanisms}} of critical {{fragmentation of the}} nano ZrO 2 ceramics were investigated. The formula of critical ductile grinding depth of the common engineering ceramics was inapplicable to the nano-ZrO 2 ceramics. A new formula of critical ductile grinding depth of the nano ceramics was established. The ultrasonic vibration grinding experiments showed that the critical ductile grinding depth of the ceramics was 15 µm by conventional grinding, but the increment of the critical ductile grinding depth was 60 percent by ultrasonic grinding. The critical ductile grinding depth increased to 25 µm. Analyzed by means of SEM, it was transgranular cracking during its cracking process. The nano-ZrO 2 ceramics have high toughness so the critical ductile grinding depth increased.

In this report, this problem is posed within a statistical framework based on principal component analysis. 1 Introduction Statistical pattern recognition begins with units, such as image regions or projected segments, on which a variety of measurements have been made. Each unit has an associated measurement vector. The purpose of statistical pattern recognition is to classify each unit on the basis of its measurement vector. The classification matches the unit with its feature vector to the "closest" category. It does so by means of a decision rule. The decision rule is designed optimally to assign each unit to a class or category on the basis of its measurement vector. Optimally can mean, for example, with the smallest classification error for a given set of measurements and [...] ...|$|E

Empirical {{studies have shown}} that the territory owner wins the majority of fights with challenging males. Several physical and physiological traits have been found to correlate with resource holding potential.

However, this possibility has not yet been thoroughly evaluated using the modern technique of geometric morphometrics to analyze shape. Therefore, this study examined whether wing shape affects the outcome of male-male contests in the territorial damselfly, Calopteryx virgo (L.) (Odonata: Calopterygidae).

Methods: A set of impellers were designed and built with identical bladeshapes, but with differing heights. Flow domains were extracted fromthe CAD drawings and meshed. ANSYS CFX was used to calculate theblood flow. A discretization study was performed, and the effects ofpressure-pressure vs pressure-flow boundary conditions, steady vs transient,time step and residuals sizes have been analysed. Flow fields werethen calculated at points along the HQ curve and the estimated pressureheads were compared with those measured in an experimental flowloop. The validated numerical model was then used to implement a seriesof design improvements on the blade (<b>shape,</b> <b>length,</b> <b>width,</b> outlet/inlet angle and number) and on the rotor geometry, volute, outlet pipe andsecondary flow. Results: As the height of the blades on the initial impellers increased from 1. 5 to 4. 5 mm the speed to reach the design point (100 mmHg and 5 l/min) decreased from 5, 900 to 5, 000 rpm. Characteristics at 10 l/min were:H< 35 mmHg and η< 12 %. After the changes the design speed was reduced(4150 rpm) and the HQ curve was significantly flatter: at 10 l/min, H = 70 mmHgand η = 32 %.

40|$|PURPOSE: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether a biopsy specimen of a fixed size can be harvested reliably and consistently by arthroscopy at the posteromedial rim of the talar dome. METHODS: A cartilage biopsy specimen was taken post mortem arthroscopically from the posteromedial rim of the talar dome in 20 ankles. We aimed to take a full-thickness biopsy specimen of 10 x 5 mm in size. The <b>shape,</b> <b>length,</b> <b>width,</b> position, and depth of the created defect were determined. Subsequently, 2 observers analyzed the biopsy sites twice. The same set of parameters and the surface area of the lesion were determined. Differences between aimed and observed sizes were studied. RESULTS: In all ankles the aimed biopsy site could be seen and reached. The observed mean size of the biopsy specimens, when compared with the aimed size, was only significantly different for the mediolateral size. A wide variation of surface area was found. Nearly all biopsy specimens started exactly at the posterior border of the dome, but they were somewhat more lateral than intended. In only half of the biopsy specimens was the shape linear or oval, the others being rounded or irregular. In case a pre-existing posteromedial cartilage lesion was present, its position did not coincide with that of the biopsy specimen. CONCLUSIONS: A limited cartilage biopsy specimen could be harvested reliably and consistently by arthroscopy at the posteromedial rim of the talar dome, although the size tended to be somewhat larger than we intended. Containment of a pre-existing posteromedial lesion was never jeopardized.

40|$|Background: Craniovertebral {{surgeries}} {{require the}} anatomical knowledge of craniovertebral junction. The human occipital condyle (OC) is unique bony structure connecting the cranium and the vertebral column. A lateral approach like transcondylar approach (TA) requires {{understanding of the}} relationships between the OC, jugular tubercle, and hypoglossal canal. Hence, the aim {{of the present study was}} to analyze the morphological variations in OCs of dry adult human skull. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out on 142 OC of 71 adult human dry skulls (55 males and 16 females). Morphometric parameters such as length, width, thickness, intercondylar distances, and the distances from the OC to the foramen magnum, hypoglossal canal and jugular foramen were measured. In addition, the different locations of the hypoglossal canal orifices in relation to the OC and different shapes of the OC were also noted. Results: The average length, width and height of the OC were found to be 2. 2, 1. 1 and 0. 9 cm. The anterior and posterior intercondylar distances were 2. 1 and 3. 9 cm, respectively. Maximum and minimum bicondylar distances were 4. 5 and 2. 6 cm, respectively. The intra-cranial orifice of the hypoglossal canal was found to be present in middle 1 / 3 rd in all skulls (100 %), and extra-cranial orifice of the hypoglossal canal was found to be in anterior 1 / 3 rd (98 %) in relation to OC. The oval shaped OC (22. 5 %) was the most predominant type of OC observed in these skulls.

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{significant}} volumes of freely available, global scale, remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data has revolutionized {{the study of}} modern depositional systems, especially with reference to their application as analogues for hydrocarbon reservoirs. While {{it is possible to}} browse Google Earth (or similar packages) and identify modern analogues, to date there have been no systematic studies which have mapped and categorized depositional systems on a global scale. Furthermore the application of data from modern systems in reservoir studies has commonly been undertaken in a qualitative way. Where measurements of geobodies are made it is often manually and prone to user error and bias. The work presented in this study details a systematic approach to the challenge of utilizing modern data as reservoir analogues from the global mapping of sedimentary basins, through the global classification of shallow marine shorelines to the automated description of sediment body geometries to their implementation in reservoir models. In addition to improved reservoir analogue studies, many aspects of this work, such as the mapping of basins and the quantification of shoreline types, have implications for broader understanding of modern systems and their preservation in the stratigraphic record. Given that the rock record is wholly comprised of deposits that were laid down in sedimentary basins, it is appropriate to only select analogous for the rock record from modern systems that sit within basins. To this end it was necessary to map the distribution of modern sedimentary basins. This was achieved using GIS algorithms that combine data on surface gradient, geology, climate and tectonics. The key result is the first known map of the World’s current terrestrial basins. Analysis of the results suggest that only about 16 % of the Earth land surface lies within a basin, the rest is in upland areas that are in long tern net erosion. Within that 16 %, 60 % is within an arid climate which is significantly more than 27 % of the total land proportion. Analysis of tectonic setting suggests that intracratonic and foreland basins are the greatest proportion by area. Paralic systems are major reservoirs. Clastic coastlines are classified on the relative importance of wave, tide and fluvial processes in transporting and depositing sediments. While this classification has existed for over 40 years, there have been no previous attempts to classify the entire coastline of the World. Using a series of GIS datasets describing factors such as mean wave height, tidal range, fluvial discharge and shoreline shape it has been possible to produce a map within which the coastline is subdivided into 927, 577 5 km segments, each of which is categorized on the primary and secondary controlling mechanism. This dataset shows that the World’s depositional coastlines are primarily wave dominated (62 %) with a significant component being tide dominated (35 %) and only 3 % being dominated by fluvial deltas. Further analysis suggests that shoreline type is heavily influenced by complex interplay between climate, latitude, shelf width, tectonic setting, ocean basin morphology and plate tectonics. The data have been analyzed by two parameters which are easily definable in the ancient (palaeo-climate and tectonic setting) to produce a probability matrix for a given shoreline type. The last two articles explore methodologies for the extraction of geometric information from modern depositional environments and outcrop data in a quantitative, objective and automated workflow. This shows a methodology for describing spatial polygons by a centerline and a series of deviations from that centerline. The method described in the third article is applied to two modern systems (the Mitchell Delta in the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Congo River in the Democratic Republic of the Congo) to show significant improvements in comparison to standard GIS routines. A linear regression line comparing a method based on the minimum bounding box (MBB) of a shape with the method developed here shows that MBB width was exaggerated up to 4. 5 times and MBB length underestimated by as much as 0. 31 times between the two datasets. As width and length of features are important parameters in object-based reservoir modeling, the potential skewed relationship of width to length ratio could reflect in associated reservoir models. By expanding on the method proposed in Paper III, the fourth paper shows that mapped 2. 5 D geobodies from virtual outcrops can automatically describe <b>shape,</b> <b>length,</b> <b>width</b> and centerline deviation. Those attributes are used to define complex shapes for object based modelling. The potential of this approach is illustrated on the non-marine portion of the Cretaceous Blackhawk Formation of the Book Cliffs in eastern Utah where data were extracted and a reservoir model was built. The results of the study are a step towards the more systematic use of modern systems as reservoir analogues and also shed light on the fundamental controls on the stratigraphic record. </p...|$|E

The experimental data showed that the mass transfer coefficients were functions of air velocity and relative humidity as well as the position of the sample relative to the inlet of the tunnel. The experimental results were compared to convective mass transfer correlations from the literature...|$|R

A 5 -point linear scoring scheme (with 0. 5 -point accuracy) was subsequently generated based on five mammary traits (udder, depth and floor inclination, teats, <b>shape,</b> <b>length,</b> and <b>width).</b> Results showed that Arabian dairy camels had voluminous udders with large-sized teats. Most common udder shape was globular (47. 3 %), followed by the pear (34. 3 %) and pendulous (18. 4 %) shapes. Conical- or funnel-shaped teats (60. 9 %) were the most frequent, followed by cylindrical- (29. 5 %) and blew-up (9. 6 %) -shaped teats. The observed variation in the udder and teat measurements, as well as in typology, attested that dromedary camels need especially large milking clusters to improve their machine milkability. Assessment of the previously indicated digital images according to the proposed linear scoring scheme, performed by 3 independent operators showed that the overall means were close to 3. 00 points (values between 2. 45 and 3. 62), and the standard deviations were close to 0. 76 points (values between 0. 58 and 0. 94). Moderate repeatability between operators (r >[*] 0. 69) was obtained for udder depth and floor inclination, indicating that training of operators, as well as improvements in the definition of traits should be considered in future studies. Further research is needed to validate the proposed linear scoring system in different stages of lactation and parities using a large number of camels. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

She asserted that the tour was a [...] "pop-electro opera" [...] because the theatrics and the story elements interwoven in it were played like an opera. According to her, the design of the show was innovative and forward in terms of creativeness. Gaga wanted to change the shape of the stage and designed one with Haus of Gaga that was [...] "essentially a frame with forced perspective, and the frame is put inside the stage." [...] The stage had a triangular inset, like a diamond, and everywhere the show took place, the dimensions were measured {{in such a way that}} the box fit any stage. [...] "So no matter where I go, my fans get the same experience. So often you go into theaters and there's ambient light flying in from all sorts of places, and the audience is in different spots, and the stage is in different <b>shapes</b> and <b>lengths</b> and <b>widths</b> and depths, so this is a way for me to control all the light and all of the different elements of the show", she added.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Many trypanosomatid {{protozoa}} {{are important}} human or animal pathogens. The well defined morphology and precisely choreographed division of trypanosomatid cells makes morphological analysis {{a powerful tool}} for analyzing the effect of mutations, chemical insults and changes between lifecycle stages. High-throughput image analysis of micrographs has the potential to accelerate collection of quantitative morphological data. Trypanosomatid cells have two large DNA-containing organelles, the kinetoplast (mitochondrial DNA) and nucleus, which provide useful markers for morphometric analysis; however they need to be accurately identified and often lie in close proximity. This presents a technical challenge. Accurate identification and quantitation of the DNA content of these organelles is a central requirement of any automated analysis method. Results We have developed a technique based on double staining of the DNA with a minor groove binding (4 '', 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI)) and a base pair intercalating (propidium iodide (PI) or SYBR green) fluorescent stain and color deconvolution. This allows the identification of kinetoplast and nuclear DNA in the micrograph based on whether the organelle has DNA with a more A-T or G-C rich composition. Following unambiguous identification of the kinetoplasts and nuclei the resulting images are amenable to quantitative automated analysis of kinetoplast and nucleus number and DNA content. On this foundation we have developed a demonstrative analysis tool capable of measuring kinetoplast and nucleus DNA content, size and position and cell body <b>shape,</b> <b>length</b> and <b>width</b> automatically. Conclusions Our approach to DNA staining and automated quantitative analysis of trypanosomatid morphology accelerated analysis of trypanosomatid protozoa. We have validated this approach using Leishmania mexicana, Crithidia fasciculata and wild-type and mutant Trypanosoma brucei. Automated analysis of T. brucei morphology was of comparable quality to manual analysis while being faster and less susceptible to experimentalist bias.

40|$|We present {{here one}} of the first high {{resolution}} spectroscopic observations of coronal rain, performed with the CRISP instrument at the Swedish Solar Telescope. This work constitutes the first attempt to assess the importance of coronal rain in the understanding of the coronal magnetic field in active regions. A large statistical set is obtained in which dynamics (total velocities and accelerations), <b>shapes</b> (<b>lengths</b> and <b>widths),</b> trajectories (angles of fall) and thermodynamic properties (temperatures) of the condensations are derived. Specifically, we find that coronal rain is composed of small and dense chromospheric cores with average <b>widths</b> and <b>lengths</b> of 310 km and 710 km respectively, average temperatures below 7000 K, displaying a broad distribution of falling speeds with an average of 70 km/s and accelerations largely below the effective gravity along loops. Through estimates of the ion-neutral coupling in the blobs we show that coronal rain acts as a tracer of the coronal magnetic field, thus supporting the multi-strand loop scenario, and acts as a probe of the local thermodynamic conditions in loops. We further find that the cooling in neighboring strands occurs simultaneously in general suggesting a similar thermodynamic evolution among strands, which can be explained by a common footpoint heating process. Constraints for coronal heating models of loops are thus provided. Estimates of the fraction of coronal volume with coronal rain give values between 7 % and 30 %. Estimates of the occurrence time of the phenomenon in loops set times between 5 and 20 hours, implying that coronal rain may be a common phenomenon, in agreement with the frequent observations of cool downflows in EUV lines. The coronal mass drain rate in the form of coronal rain is estimated to be on the order of 5 x 10 ^ 9 g/s, a significant quantity compared to the estimate of mass flux into the corona from spicules.
