500|$|In 2004, {{the company}} was {{acquired}} by Ajay Singh and the airline planned to restart operations as SpiceJet following the low-cost model. SpiceJet leased two Boeing 737-800 aircraft in 2005 and planned to order 10 new aircraft for expansion. SpiceJet opened bookings on 18 May 2005 and the first flight was operated between Delhi and Mumbai on 24 May 2005. By July 2008, it was India's third-largest low-cost carrier in terms of market share after Air Deccan and IndiGo.

40|$|With {{an overall}} goal of {{defining}} {{the needs and}} requirements for <b>short-haul</b> transport <b>aircraft</b> research and development, {{the objective of this}} paper is to determine the performance and noise impact of <b>short-haul</b> transport <b>aircraft</b> designed with an advanced turboprop propulsion system. This propulsion system features high-speed propellers that have more blades and reduced diameters. Aircraft are designed for short and medium field lengths; mission block fuel and direct operating costs (DOC) are used as performance measures. The propeller diameter was optimized to minimize DOC. Two methods are employed to estimate the weight of the acoustic treatment needed to reduce interior noise to an acceptable level. Results show decreasing gross weight, block fuel, DOC, engine size, and optimum propfan diameter with increasing field length. The choice of acoustic treatment method has a significant effect on the aircraft design...|$|R

40|$|The aerial {{relay system}} concept, which was {{developed}} {{as a means of}} exploiting inflight transfer, utilizing large 'cruise liner' aircraft that fly continuously along their routes and dock periodically with <b>short-haul</b> 'feeder' <b>aircraft</b> for payload exchanges, is discussed. The system employs two distinctly different kinds of aircraft, one for takeoff and landing and one for cruising, with provisions for the routine inflight transfer of passengers, baggage, fuel, etc. The liner design consists of a module of 320 ft span and 80 ft chord with an 800 seat capacity and capable of cruising at 0. 75 M, while the feeder is a relatively conventional <b>short-haul</b> transport <b>aircraft</b> with a modified fuselage to accommodate special docking and transportation operations.
