At each survey cycle, participants complete self-report questionnaires in their classroom under the supervision of trained data collectors. A sub-sample of 24 physically active students is interviewed annually using a semi-structured interview protocol. Parents (or guardians) complete telephone administered questionnaires every two years, and a health and wellness school audit is completed for each school. Discussion: MATCH will provide a description of the patterns of participation in <b>specific</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> in youth, and enable identification of the determinants of maintenance, decline, and uptake of participation in each activity.

30|$|In conclusion, {{physical}} activity {{was found to}} be associated with the components of metabolic syndrome and with the prevalence of metabolic syndrome. It was found that the effects of {{physical activity}} varied significantly depending on the type and frequency of the physical activity participation. Regular physical activity and the avoidance of physical inactivity are key principles for the prevention of metabolic syndrome. When patients are diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, it is important to check the underlying risk components related to metabolic syndrome. From that information, better recommendations can be made that address <b>specific</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> types and frequencies that could benefit the patient in their efforts to reverse the condition of metabolic syndrome.|$|E

Some of these concerns related to judgment in swimsuits resulted in participants not participating in the activity.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} favorable physical activities, by intensity, type, and frequency that would serve to minimize the prevalence of metabolic syndrome. A total of 24, 178 individuals participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey that investigated the risk factors for metabolic syndrome and physical activity including the physical activity type (vigorous and moderate activity, walking, strength, and flexibility) and the frequency (numbers of days per weeks where physical activity lasted at least 10  min per session). Complex-samples analysis, descriptive statistics, Pearson’s Chi-square test, and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to analyze the data. The results confirmed that physical activity had a favorable effect on reducing the occurrence of metabolic syndrome. The lowest prevalence of metabolic syndrome was observed when vigorous physical activity was conducted six times per week (OR 0.65, 95 % CI 0.45 – 0.94). The associated beneficial effects included improvements in the risk factors of metabolic syndrome, depending on the <b>specific</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> type and frequency.

Background: This systematic review synthesises the results of studies examining naturally occurring <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> in women before they become pregnant and the magnitude and type of changes during pregnancy and the postnatal period. Methods: Electronic databases were searched for relevant articles and PRISMA guidelines for selection of articles were used. Only studies examining naturally occurring, non-intervention changes in regular activity levels were included. The quality assessment was based on protocols of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Of the initial 720 titles, 24 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final review. Results: Compared to pre-pregnancy, the magnitude of <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> decreased over the course of pregnancy and postnatally and the types of activities tended to be of lesser intensity than pre-pregnancy.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{subgroups of}} Australian adults {{likely to receive}} physical activity advice from their general practitioner and to evaluate {{the content of the}} advice provided. METHODS: Participants (n= 1, 799), recruited from the Australian Health and Social Science panel, completed an online survey. Signal Detection Analysis was used to identify subgroups that were more/less likely to have received physical activity recommendations. RESULTS: Overall, 18 % of participants received a physical activity recommendation from their general practitioner in the past 12 months and eight unique subgroups were identified. The subgroup with the highest proportion (54 %) of participants reporting that they received a physical activity recommendation was those with poor physical and mental health-related quality of life and an average daily sitting time of < 11 hours. Other subgroups with high proportions of individuals receiving recommendations were characterised by higher weight and/or the presence of co-morbidities. The most commonly prescribed physical activity type was aerobic activity. Few participants received <b>specific</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> advice.
