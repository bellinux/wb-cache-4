Cristina and Owen reconcile in episode 9 before Bailey's wedding.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn was a {{fine and}} {{enthusiastic}} artist in pencil and watercolour, a skill which he used throughout his life for his own amusement {{and that of his}} friends. His enormous correspondence <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could also be a witty writer in German and English– sometimes accompanied by humorous sketches and cartoons in the text.|$|E
5|$|Statistical {{rating systems}} give Steinitz a rather low ranking among world champions, mainly because he took several long breaks from {{competitive}} play. However, an analysis {{based on one}} of these rating systems <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was one of the most}} dominant players in the history of the game. Steinitz was unbeaten in match play for 32 years, from 1862 to 1894.|$|E
50|$|Berthelet {{probably}} {{began his}} first successful business ventures in the fur trade. Records <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was successful as a wheat merchant. Real estate transaction records <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was the largest}} property owner in Montreal by 1820.|$|R
60|$|Larry, whose {{back was}} nearly {{turned to the}} chair where the {{attorney}} was sitting, said nothing; but he gave an ominous look round, which <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had heard what had passed.

5|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that Lithuanians began combining their forces {{at the dawn of}} the 13th century. For example, in 1207, soldiers were recruited across Lithuania to fight the German religious orders, and in 1212, Daugirutis' treaty with Novgorod <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> exerted some degree of influence over a vast area. During the first twenty years of the 13th century, Lithuanians organized some thirty military expeditions to Livonia, Russia, and Poland. Historian Tomas Baranauskas argues that a Lithuanian state could be said to exist as early as 1183.|$|E
5|$|The {{inscriptions}} {{are in the}} Urnes style (Pr4), {{and they}} were commissioned by a former captain of the Varangian Guard named Ragnvaldr in memory of his mother {{as well as in}} his own honour. Very few could boast of returning home with the honour of having been the captain of the Varangian Guard. Moreover, the name Ragnvaldr <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> belonged to the higher echelons of Old Norse society, and that he may have been a relative of the ruling dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{realizes he}} needs to make amends with Lisa, but she is too hurt to even talk with him. Homer briefly cheers her up, but <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> still only wants to win a bet. She agrees to tell Homer who she thinks the winner will be, but she fears that she may be so distraught that she subconsciously wants Homer to lose his bet, leading her to a cryptic prediction: if she still loves Homer, Washington will win; if she does not, Buffalo. As a nervous Homer watches the game at Moe's Tavern, Washington scores {{at the last second}} to win the game. Homer becomes happy and Bart tells Lisa that she still loves Homer, in which she agrees. Homer cancels his bowling date with Barney and—on the Sunday after the Super Bowl—makes good on his promise to go hiking with Lisa.|$|E

5|$|In Brood War, Fenix and Raynor remain {{behind as}} a rear guard when the Protoss {{evacuate}} the now Zerg-overrun Aiur through a warp gate. They hold it until attacked by United Earth Directorate forces pursuing Arcturus Mengsk, upon which they escape through the gate, disabling {{it as they}} depart. With Raynor and Mengsk, Fenix enters into an alliance with Sarah Kerrigan against the UED, even leading the Zerg forces on a raiding mission for resources on Moria. However, after the UED is routed from their position on the Dominion capital world of Korhal, Kerrigan turns on her allies. Though unfazed by Kerrigan's betrayal, Fenix is slain when Kerrigan's Zerg launch a surprise attack against his base camp on Korhal. In StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, Raynor <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> still harbors a grudge against Kerrigan for Fenix's death after seeing her willingly become infested again after all his hard work in returning her to human form.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} months of 1894, Robey {{returned}} to London to honour {{a contract for}} Augustus Harris at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, the details of which are unknown. In September he starred {{in a series of}} stand-up comedy <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would perform every September between 1894 and 1899. These short performances, in English seaside resorts including Scarborough and Bournemouth, were designed chiefly to enhance his name among provincial audiences. For the 1895 and 1896 Christmas pantomimes, he appeared in Manchester and Birmingham, respectively, in the title role of Dick Whittington, for which he received favourable reviews and praise from audiences. Despite the show's success, Robey and his co-stars disliked the experience. The actress Ada Reeve felt that the production had a bad back-stage atmosphere and was thankful when the season ended, while the comedian Barry Lupino was dismayed at having his role, Muffins, considerably reduced.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{judge is}} empowered to exempt {{from being an}} illegal practice any particular act or omission by a candidate, his or her election agents or any other agent or person in paying a sum, incurring an expense or entering into a contract if {{it was done in}} good faith and was due to inadvertence, accidental miscalculation or the like. Similarly, the judge may make an order allowing an authorized excuse for a failure to file a proper return or declaration relating to election expenses if the candidate or his or her principal election agent <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> or she acted in good faith {{and that there is a}} reasonable explanation for the shortcoming such as inadvertence or illness, or the absence, death, illness or misconduct of some other agent, clerk or officer. In particular, the judge may relieve a candidate from the consequences of an act or omission by his or her principal election agent if he or she did not sanction or connive in it and took all reasonable means to prevent it.|$|E

5|$|The first {{definite}} {{record of}} his employment is dated 19 April 1477, and it <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a singer at the chapel of René, Duke of Anjou, in Aix-en-Provence. He remained there at least until 1478. No certain records of his movements exist for the period from March 1478 until 1483, but if he remained in the employ of René he would have transferred to Paris in 1481 {{along with the rest}} of the chapel. One of Josquin's early motets, Misericordias Domini in aeternum cantabo, suggests a direct connection with Louis XI, who was king during this time. In 1483 Josquin returned to Condé to claim his inheritance from his aunt and uncle, who may have been killed by the army of Louis XI in May 1478, when they besieged the town, locked the population into the church, and burned them alive.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, LaBonge finds a {{man named}} Cissy Alvarez whom Maleeni owed money. LaBonge admits that he caused Maleeni's head to fall off, and says that he will give Alvarez the money he is owed if he helps him with his magic. Mulder and Scully learn that Maleeni has an {{identical}} twin brother, Albert. Albert, interestingly enough is even wearing a neckbrace, which he says he got {{in a car accident}} in Mexico. Mulder tells him he thinks he did the magic act, but the man <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has no legs, which he also lost in Mexico in the car accident. Back at work, Alvarez threatens Pinchbeck that he will kill him if he does not get his money. LaBonge then frames Alvarez for a robbery by attacking a security truck disguised as Alvarez. Mulder soon finds out that Pinchbeck is the real Maleeni and that he faked having no legs. After confronting Pinchbeck, he admits that he faked his own death in order to get out of Alvarez's debt. Pinchbeck admits that he found his brother dead of a heart attack at home and used his body as a double. Pinchbeck is promptly arrested, as is LaBonge, who brings a gun to a bar, in an attempt to purposely get arrested. In addition, Alvarez is arrested because of the attempted robbery LaBonge did earlier.|$|E

25|$|Payment {{records for}} Morton end in 1476, {{and it was}} long assumed that he died then; however more recent {{evidence}} from the Vatican archive <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was alive as late as 1479, since he resigned a Dutch parish then.|$|E
