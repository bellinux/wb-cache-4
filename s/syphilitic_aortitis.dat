50|$|<b>Syphilitic</b> <b>aortitis</b> (SA) is {{inflammation}} of the aorta associated with the tertiary stage of syphilis infection. SA begins as {{inflammation of}} the outermost layer of the blood vessel, including the blood vessels that supply the aorta itself with blood, the vasa vasorum. As SA worsens, the vasa vasorum undergo hyperplastic thickening of their walls thereby restricting blood flow and causing ischemia of the outer two-thirds of the aortic wall. Starved for oxygen and nutrients, elastic fibers become patchy and smooth muscle cells die. If the disease progresses, <b>syphilitic</b> <b>aortitis</b> leads to an aortic aneurysm. Unlike atherosclerosis, which typically manifests in older people, <b>syphilitic</b> <b>aortitis</b> typically affects those {{under the age of}} 50. It has become rare in the developed world with the advent of penicillin treatments after World War II.|$|E

5000|$|Underlying cause. For example, {{the cause}} of <b>syphilitic</b> <b>aortitis</b> is {{infectious}} (aortitis simply refers to inflammation of the aorta, which is an artery.)

In these cases, the antibody found is sometimes used in classification, as in ANCA-associated vasculitides.|$|E
5000|$|Due to <b>Syphilitic</b> <b>aortitis</b> (a {{complication}} of tertiary syphilis) the aortic valve ring becomes dilated. The free margins of valve cusps no longer approximate leading to aortic valve insufficiency.

30|$|Cardiovascular {{syphilis}} generally manifests about 15 – 30  years {{after the}} initial infection (Beppu et al. 2014). In particular, aortic aneurysm {{is the most common}} complication of <b>syphilitic</b> <b>aortitis,</b> and the ascending aorta is the segment most commonly affected (50  %), followed by the arch (35  %) and the descending aorta (15  %) (Sato et al. 2014). In Roberts et al. study (Roberts et al. 2015), they emphasized that syphilis remains a major cause of ascending aortic aneurysm. From January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014, they studied 23 patients who had resection of an ascending aortic aneurysm that again histologically had classic features of <b>syphilitic</b> <b>aortitis.</b> All 23 patients were found to have <b>syphilitic</b> <b>aortitis</b> grossly and histologically.|$|E

40|$|Context: <b>Syphilitic</b> <b>aortitis</b> {{has been}} relegated to the {{category}} of rare cardiovascular disease or a "medical curiosity" in the west. The same situation may not exist in developing countries due to the stigmata that continue to remain attached to sexually-transmitted diseases in general. Aims: To study the prevalence of <b>syphilitic</b> <b>aortitis</b> among autopsied non-atherosclerotic aortic diseases encountered in a span of 15 years. Settings and Design: Retrospective, autopsy-based study. Materials and Methods: Among 187 cases of non-atherosclerotic diseases of the aorta, 44 had been diagnosed as <b>syphilitic</b> <b>aortitis</b> {{on the basis of}} the pathological features and serology. The demographic details and modes of clinical presentation were retrieved from the health records. Depending on the presence of complicating lesions, the cases were classified as uncomplicated or complicated aortitis. Results: The 44 cases of <b>syphilitic</b> <b>aortitis</b> formed 23. 5 &#x 0025; of the non-atherosclerotic aortic diseases. They were predominantly seen in males in the fifth decade, who often presented with valvular regurgitation, aneurysmal disease or myocardial ischemia; 13. 6 &#x 0025; of patients were asymptomatic. Blood VDRL results were available in 19 patients; 84. 2 &#x 0025; were positive. Concomitant involvement of the ascending, transverse and descending thoracic was seen in 45. 5 &#x 0025; of cases. None had uncomplicated aortitis. Complications in the form of aortic regurgitation (72. 7 &#x 0025;), coronary ostial stenosis (59 &#x 0025;) and aneurysms (59 &#x 0025;) frequently coexisted. Thirty-five aneurysms were present in 59 &#x 0025;, chiefly involving the aorta. Conclusions: We found <b>syphilitic</b> <b>aortitis</b> to be a common cause of aortitis at autopsy. Diagnosis should be made with the help of characteristic pathological features correlated to the clinical context and appropriate serological tests...|$|E

30|$|Syphilitic aortic {{aneurysm}} (SAA) {{is caused by}} tertiary stage of syphilis infection. As the wide application of penicillin, this complication is becoming rarer than before. However, <b>syphilitic</b> <b>aortitis</b> (SA) dose still exist in developed and developing country (Vaideeswar 2010; Roberts et al. 2009). At the beginning, inflammation starts from outermost layer of the blood vessel, including the vasa vasorum that supply the aorta itself with blood. As the situation worsens, the vasa vasorum undergo hyperplastic thickening of their walls thereby restricting blood flow and causing ischemia of the outer two-thirds of the aortic wall. If it continues progressing, <b>syphilitic</b> <b>aortitis</b> leads to an {{aortic aneurysm}}. Recognition of cardiovascular syphilis is important because {{in addition to the}} broader management of aneurysmal disease, it warrants antibiotic therapy for which penicillin is preferred (Mohamed Sarjun Basha et al. 2016; Beppu et al. 2014). Pulmonary lesions in patients with tertiary syphilis are considered to be of syphilitic origin if other causes can be excluded and particularly if the lesion disappears after antisyphilitic treatment (de Almeida Feitosa et al. 2015). However, the SAA with lung cancer is a very rare disease in patient. Herein, we report a very rare case of SAA with a neoplasm located in the left lower lobe in a 55 -year-old man.|$|E
