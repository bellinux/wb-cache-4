5|$|A legend links Szczerbiec with King Bolesław I the Brave who {{was said}} to have chipped the sword by hitting it against the Golden Gate, Kiev (now in Ukraine) during his {{intervention}} in the Kievan succession crisis in 1018. However, the Golden Gate was only constructed in 1037 and the sword is actually dated to the late 12th or 13th century. It was first used as a coronation sword by Władysław I the Elbow-high in 1320. Looted by Prussian troops in 1795, it changed hands <b>several</b> <b>times</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 19th century until it was purchased in 1884 for the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The Soviet Union returned it to Poland in 1928. During World War II, Szczerbiec was evacuated to Canada and did not return to Kraków until 1959.

5|$|During the English Civil War in the 1640s the old medieval {{walls were}} {{reinforced}} with modern earthwork bastions and an outlying fort, called a sconce. Worcester changed hands <b>several</b> <b>times</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> conflict, {{and after the}} war ended the newer fortifications were dismantled. During the 18th century the older medieval stone walls and gatehouses were sold and mostly destroyed: by the 20th century, few parts survived. Post-war archaeology in the 1950s and 1960s and construction work in the 1970s revealed previously hidden stretches of the wall, and in the 21st century plans have been drawn up to improve the conservation and maintenance of this historic monument.|$|E
5|$|Mengele's {{name was}} {{mentioned}} <b>several</b> <b>times</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Nuremberg trials, but Allied forces {{were convinced that}} he was dead.

Working in West Germany, Nazi hunters Simon Wiesenthal and Hermann Langbein collected information from witnesses as to Mengele's wartime activities. In a search of the public records, Langbein found Mengele's divorce papers listing an address in Buenos Aires. He and Wiesenthal pressured West German authorities into drawing up an arrest warrant on 5 June 1959, and starting extradition proceedings. Initially Argentina turned down the request, because the fugitive was no longer living at the address given on the documents. By the time extradition was approved on 30 June 1960, Mengele had already fled to Paraguay, where he was living on a farm near the Argentine border.|$|E

The regiment reached Shellal at 03:00, where they stopped to water their horses. At dawn hostile aircraft appeared overhead, which were engaged by the 11th Squadron, forcing them to fly at a higher altitude. By 09:00 the regiment was positioned overlooking Hareira, Sheria, and the Gaza-Beersheba rail line. <b>Several</b> <b>times</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> day they were machine gunned by hostile aircraft, but no casualties were sustained.
