The community units were cheaper than the <b>small</b> <b>houses</b> and the hospitals, despite serving people with more severe handicaps. The <b>small</b> <b>houses</b> were slightly more expensive than the hospitals but, under certain assumptions, could be viewed as incurring equivalent costs. Clear evidence of economies of scale was not found except in the comparison between the community units and the <b>small</b> <b>houses.</b> However, other research has shown that <b>small</b> <b>houses</b> can provide a superior quality of care...|$|R

5|$|More {{recently}} still, Trollope {{scholars have}} looked upon it with increasing favour, describing it {{as a powerful}} work that has suffered undeserved neglect. Present-day critics have focussed increasingly on the Carry Brattle subplot; it has been suggested, {{supported in part by}} the similarity of passages from The Vicar, from the Autobiography, and from The <b>Small</b> <b>House</b> at Allington referring to Johnny Eames, that some aspects of her portrayal are based on the novelist's own early adulthood in London.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 17, Mercury and {{his family}} fled from Zanzibar for safety reasons due to the 1964 Zanzibar Revolution, in which {{thousands}} of Arabs and Indians were killed. The family moved into a <b>small</b> <b>house</b> at 22 Gladstone Avenue, Feltham, Middlesex, England. Mercury enrolled at Isleworth Polytechnic (now West Thames College) in West London where he studied art. He ultimately earned a diploma in Art and Graphic Design at Ealing Art College (now the Ealing campus of University of West London), later using these skills to design the Queen heraldic arms. A British citizen at birth, Mercury remained so {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
40|$|The prehistoric {{cultural}} landscape of Chaco Canyon {{is made up}} of monumental great <b>houses</b> and <b>small</b> <b>houses.</b> The Chaco Canyon architectural record has been extensively studied, yet the relationship between great and <b>small</b> <b>houses</b> remains a fundamental problem of Southwest archaeology. By using space syntax access analyses, I examine in this research the spatial organisation of great and <b>small</b> <b>houses</b> and compare the two structures in terms of form and function. Space syntax is used to analyse twenty <b>small</b> <b>houses</b> and eleven discrete room blocks from three great houses. Access graphs are constructed and used to generate syntactic data. These data are examined by: (1) exploratory data analyses to identify temporal patterning in spatial integration and control; (2) difference factor analyses; (3) the identification of spatial phenotypes; and (4) analyses of inequality or functional genotypes. Statistically significant differences among integration values for both <b>small</b> and great <b>houses</b> over time are demonstrated. Difference factor analyses identify a robust spatial structure for <b>small</b> <b>houses.</b> This strong structure is a result of differences in spatial integration between built space and built form, and between spatial functions. Great houses are found to have a much weaker spatial structure. The results of this research are used to evaluate the spatial implications of the currently proposed Chaco great house models. Syntactical analyses suggest that it is unlikely that any one model fits all the great <b>houses.</b> The <b>small</b> <b>houses</b> appear domestic in nature and organisation. However, there is also evidence that not all <b>small</b> <b>houses</b> are equal: functional specialisation may be present. Examining the social and spatial relationships of kivas and mealing bin rooms at both great and <b>small</b> <b>houses</b> seems a promising avenue for future inquiry. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1764 the {{population}} of the island was 52. Later census records show that there were 113residents in 1841, 150 in 1881, 142 in 1891 (occupying 28houses, compared to the 1841 total of 19), and 135 in 1901. Families were often large, and ten or more children was not uncommon, with three generations sometimes sharing a single <b>small</b> <b>house.</b> Life was co-operative with fishing, waulking, peat cutting and landing the boats all being communal activities. The island is remote but was by no means cut off. In the 19th century fishermen sold fish in Glasgow and Ireland, both men and women worked on the east coast herring fishing industry, and food was brought in from mainland Scotland on a regular basis.|$|E

Under the subsequent Lord Wardens, the politicians Robert Darcy, the Earl of Holderness, and Francis North, the Earl of Guildford, the castle continued to house artillery but it became increasingly less military in character.|$|E

5|$|The Selfe family {{landed at}} Sydney's Semi-circular Quay in January 1855, when Norman was 15 years old. One {{of the reasons}} they emigrated to the colony of New South Wales was to enable him and his brother Harry to {{undertake}} engineering apprenticeships without having to pay the heavy premium required by large firms in London. They initially resided in the nearby Rocks district in a <b>small</b> <b>house</b> that had previously been the first Sydney home of Mary Reibey, a former convict who became Australia's first businesswoman. Selfe's parents had high expectations of their children, particularly of Norman, whose ability in mathematics and draughtsmanship was apparent from a young age. The brothers earned a reputation for innovation during their youth, and were the first to construct a velocipede in the country.|$|E
5|$|Whale {{returned}} to California in November 1952 and advised David Lewis {{that he planned}} to bring Foegel over early the following year. Appalled, Lewis moved out of their home. While this ended their 23-year romantic relationship, the two men remained friends. Lewis bought a <b>small</b> <b>house</b> and dug a swimming pool, prompting Whale to have his own pool dug, although he did not himself swim in it. He began throwing all-male swim parties and would watch the young men cavort in and around the pool. Foegel moved in with Whale in early 1953 and remained there for several months before returning to France. He returned in 1954 permanently, and Whale installed him as manager of a gas station that he owned.|$|E
5|$|While {{attempting}} to establish {{himself as a}} composer, Gustav Holst worked first as an orchestral trombonist, and later as a teacher. In 1907 he held teaching posts at James Allen's Girls' School in Dulwich, and St Paul's Girls' School (SPGS) in Hammersmith, where he was director of music. He also taught evening classes at Morley College, an adult education centre in the Waterloo district of London. Shortly after Imogen's birth the family moved from Richmond to a <b>small</b> <b>house</b> by the river in nearby Barnes, which they rented from a relative.

5|$|By seven-thirty, {{the town}} was firmly {{in the hands of}} Major-General Hunter's force. Almost the {{entirety}} of the Mahdist garrison, excepting the cavalry, had been slain in desperate combats throughout the settlement. However, a few isolated pockets of Mahdist resistance remained in fortified houses, violently refusing to give up the fight. Six men sent to capture a Mahdist sniper's position in a <b>small</b> <b>house</b> near the river were each killed, forcing Hunter to invoke his artillery. The building was shelled to ruins, but the sniper survived, evidenced by the shooting of another soldier sent to locate his body. Finally, a second barrage of artillery blasted what remained of the structure and the rubble fell silent, though the sniper's body was never found. The local inhabitants had armed themselves with clubs and spears to defend themselves during the battle, but played little role in its outcome.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Sihanouk built a {{personal}} residence at Chamkarmon District {{where he lived}} {{over the next ten}} years as the Head of State. Following his overthrow in 1970, Sihanouk took up residence in Beijing, where he lived at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in the first year of his stay. In 1971 Sihanouk moved to a larger residence in the city that once housed the French embassy. The residence was equipped with a temperature-adjustable swimming pool, cinema and seven chefs to cook his meals. In 1974 North Korean leader Kim Il-sung built Changsuwon, a 40-room mansion, for Sihanouk. Changsuwon was built near an artificial lake, and Sihanouk spent time taking boat trips there and also shot a few films within the compound. In August 2008 Sihanouk declared his assets on his website, which according to him consisted of a <b>small</b> <b>house</b> in Siem Reap and 30,000 Euros of cash savings stored in a French bank. He also stated that his residences in Beijing and Pyongyang were guesthouses owned by the governments of China and North Korea, respectively, and that they did not belong to him.|$|E
