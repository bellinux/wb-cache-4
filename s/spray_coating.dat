40|$|The test {{specimens}} of NiCrBSi coating were prepared using the high velocity oxy-fuel spraying technique with a post-thermal treatment. Their high-speed slurry erosion characteristics have been systematically studied. SUS {{304 stainless steel}} {{was selected as the}} comparison material. Experimental results show that the NiCrBSi <b>sprayed</b> <b>coating</b> exhibits a much better slurry erosion resistance than the SUS 304 stainless steel. The erosion rate for the NiCrBSi <b>sprayed</b> <b>coating</b> slightly increases with the impinged angle. However, a maximum erosion rate appears at an impinged angle of around 30 degrees for SUS 304 stainless steel. Both NiCrBSi <b>sprayed</b> <b>coating</b> and SUS 304 stainless steel exhibit impinged surfaces with lots of furrows at an impinged angle of 30 degrees. At a high impinged angle of 90 degrees, the SUS 304 stainless steel exhibits an impinged surface with lots of overlapping and irregular concavities, while, these features are less obvious for NiCrBSi <b>sprayed</b> <b>coating.</b> The hardness of SUS 304 stainless steel increases significantly with increasing impinged angle during the high-speed slurry erosion. But, there is no obvious work hardening for the NiCrBSi <b>sprayed</b> <b>coating</b> due to its extra-high hardness and less plastic deformation, even at a high impinged angle of 90 degrees.

A thermal <b>sprayed</b> <b>coating</b> produced by using a compound fluorine-carbon cored wire exhibits excellent water-repellency. However, the contact angles of water of the coating surface show remarkable scatters since the fluorine is usually difficult to be distributed uniformly on the coating surface. To improve the homogeneity of the water-repellency of the thermal <b>sprayed</b> <b>coating,</b> a surface modification using silane solution was further processed. Optimal processing conditions were investigated.

40|$|In this study, we {{demonstrate}} the microstructure dependency of erosion behaviour of laser clad, detonation sprayed and atmospheric plasma sprayed chromium carbide based coatings. The final chromium carbide content {{in all the}} coatings was a strong function of rapid solidification rate associated with the processes. In the laser clad coating majority of the chromium carbides re-solidified while in the thermally sprayed coatings chromium carbide re-solidification was hindered to a large extent. Hence, the final chromium carbide content in the thermally <b>sprayed</b> <b>coating</b> decreased with increased extent of particle melting during spraying. Decarburisation and oxidation during thermal spraying lead {{to the formation of}} chromium carbides with lower carbon content and chromium oxide(s). Laser clad and detonation sprayed coatings, with higher chromium carbide content, showed lower erosion rates and exhibited fewer brittle erosion events. Embrittlement due to excessive dissolution of chromium carbides into the matrix and poor splat bonding were found to be the reasons for higher erosion rate of the plasma <b>sprayed</b> <b>coating.</b> Scanning electron microscopy and quantification of single erodent impact events clearly established ductile material removal in the laser clad and detonation <b>sprayed</b> <b>coating</b> and brittle material removal in the plasma <b>sprayed</b> <b>coating</b> as the dominant mechanism(s). A good agreement was found between solid particle erosion testing and nano impact testing results...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effects of}} imposed displacement and initial coating thickness on fretting wear behaviour of a thermally <b>sprayed</b> <b>coating.</b> Initial coating thickness and imposed displacement between two mating components are important parameters affecting durability of a thermally <b>sprayed</b> <b>coating</b> under fretting conditions. Nevertheless, the effects of imposed displacement and coating thickness at flat-and-rounded frictional contacts of aerospace dovetail connections are not sufficiently investigated. In this paper, fretting wear experiments with a double-layer thermally <b>sprayed</b> <b>coating</b> are performed under different displacement and coating thickness conditions. The effects of the parameters are then identified by directly comparing the ratio of maximum tangential force to normal force. Experimental {{results show that the}} ratio evolutions are similar on the ratio versus accumulated reciprocal sliding distance chart within the displacement range of 0. 4 - 0. 6. mm. In addition, it is demonstrated that durability of the coating is increased with increasing the initial thickness of the coating. Finally, the effect of the initial coating thickness is described with exponential evolution law of fretting damage. © 2011 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

40|$|Abrasive wear {{behaviour}} {{of materials}} {{can be assessed}} using {{a wide variety of}} testing methods, and the relative performance of materials will tend to depend upon the testing procedure employed. In this work, two cermet type coatings have been examined, namely (i) a conventional tungsten carbide-cobalt thermally <b>sprayed</b> <b>coating</b> with a carbide size of between ∼ 0. 3 – 5 μm and (ii) a tungsten carbide-nickel alloy weld overlay with large spherical carbides of the order of ∼ 50 – 140 μm in diameter (DuraStell). The wear behaviour of these two materials has been examined by the use of two abrasion tests, namely the micro-scale abrasion test using both silica and alumina abrasives (typically 2 - 10 μm in size), and the dry sand-rubber wheel test (ASTM G 65), again with both silica and alumina abrasives (typically 180 – 300 μm in size). It was found that when the abrasive particles were of the same scale or larger than the mean free path between the hard phase particles, then the matrix phase was well protected by the hard phases. Testing (in both test types) with alumina abrasives resulted in wear of both the hard carbide phases and the matrix phases in both the thermally <b>sprayed</b> <b>coating</b> and the weld overlay, with the thermally <b>sprayed</b> <b>coating</b> exhibiting lower wear rates. The wear behaviour of the materials with the more industrially relevant silica abrasive was more complex; the thermally <b>sprayed</b> <b>coating</b> exhibited a lower wear rate than the weld overlay with the fine abrasive in the micro-scale abrasion test due to effective shielding of the matrix from abrasive action due to the fine reinforcement particle size. In contrast, with the coarser silica abrasive in the dry sand-rubber wheel test, the weld overlay with the large carbides was able to provide matrix protection with low rates of wear, whereas the thermally <b>sprayed</b> <b>coating</b> wore by fracture of the more brittle microstructure. These findings demonstrate the importance of selection of appropriate laboratory test procedures and abrasives to simulate behaviour of materials in service environments...|$|R

So {{it is important to understand}} the mechanism of hot corrosion in metals/alloys at high temperatures and to provide the protective coating for their economic, reliable and safe operation.

The present investigation is an attempt to compare the resistance offered against hot corrosion by Nickel based <b>coating</b> <b>sprayed</b> by two different thermal <b>spray</b> techniques. <b>Coating</b> powder containing 80 %Ni 20 %Cr was deposited on SA- 213 (T 22) using two thermal spray techniques, HVOF and Plasma spray.
