5|$|The raid {{was carried}} out by {{approximately}} two dozen heliborne U.S. Navy SEALs from DEVGRU's Red Squadron. For legal reasons (namely that the U.S. was not at war with Pakistan), the military personnel assigned to the mission were temporarily transferred to the control of the civilian Central Intelligence Agency. The SEALs operated in multiple teams, and were equipped with a variety of gear and weaponry. The weapons were fitted with a variety of accessories, including sound <b>suppressors,</b> which were used to avoid alerting residents of Bin Laden's compound and neighboring properties.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal {{therapy is}} only {{beneficial}} in {{certain types of}} endometrial cancer. It was {{once thought to be}} beneficial in most cases. If a tumor is well-differentiated and known to have progesterone and estrogen receptors, progestins may be used in treatment. About 25% of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins. Also, endometrial stromal sarcomas can be treated with hormonal agents, including tamoxifen, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, letrozole, megestrol acetate, and medroxyprogesterone. This treatment is effective in endometrial stromal sarcomas because they typically have estrogen and/or progestin receptors. Progestin receptors function as tumor <b>suppressors</b> in endometrial cancer cells. Preliminary research and clinical trials have shown these treatments to have a high rate of response even in metastatic disease.|$|E
40|$|A {{bacterial}} strain was constructed which permitted positive selection for ochre <b>suppressor</b> mutations {{as well as}} for the loss of <b>suppressor</b> function. A derivative bearing an ochre <b>suppressor</b> mutation was selected following mutagenesis with N-methyl-N-nitroso-N'-nitroguanidine. The suppressor-bearing strain was treated with nitrous acid to eliminate <b>suppressor</b> function by mutation, and a strain lacking <b>suppressor</b> activity was selected. The selected strain which had lost <b>suppressor</b> function was then subjected to mutagenesis to induce a second <b>suppressor</b> mutation. The alternating sequence (induction of an ochre <b>suppressor</b> mutation â†’ induction of a mutation eliminating ochre <b>suppressor</b> activity) was repeated 29 and one-half times in a single strain. Some of the <b>suppressor</b> mutations were tentatively mapped at four locations on the chromosome. The first <b>suppressor</b> mutation selected maps at about minute 30 on the chromosome. The second <b>suppressor</b> selected maps at approximately minute 60, while the third <b>suppressor</b> maps nearby, possibly as far as minute 72. Among the subsequently selected <b>suppressor</b> mutations, all eleven which were mapped were cotransducible with the gal and nic loci near minute 36 on the chromosome and may represent more than one <b>suppressor</b> gene. Deletions were selected which inactivate two of the ochre <b>suppressor</b> alleles mapping near the gal-nic region, suggesting that one or more such genes are dispensable. Some evidence also suggests that the occurrence of either deletion mutations or transduction-mediated recombination events in the gal-nic region can cause instability of nearby <b>suppressor</b> alleles...|$|R

The {{present study was}} undertaken to determine the duration of <b>suppressor</b> activity of the different components of the <b>suppressor</b> pathway on adoptive transfer in recipient mice. It was observed that the <b>suppressor</b> activity of TS 1 cells lasts for 21 days, of TS 2 for 15 days, of SF for 7 to 10 days and of SF 2 for 7 days.

From experiments in four different models of generation of effector cells the following conclusions are drawn: (1) impulses activating {{the formation of}} effector cells also activate <b>suppressor</b> cells; (2) under conditions of conventional immunization, <b>suppressor</b> cells are activated later than effector cells; (3) elimination of <b>suppressor</b> cells results {{in an increase in}} the intensity and duration of specific skin reactions...|$|R
5|$|The {{demand for}} {{selenium}} by the electronics industry is declining, despite {{a number of}} continuing applications. Its photovoltaic and photoconductive properties are still useful in photocopying, photocells, light meters and solar cells. Its use as a photoconductor in plain-paper copiers once was a leading application, but in the 1980s, the photoconductor application declined (although {{it was still a}} large end-use) as more and more copiers switched to organic photoconductors. Though once widely used, selenium rectifiers have mostly been replaced (or are being replaced) by silicon-based devices. The most notable exception is in power DC surge protection, where the superior energy capabilities of selenium <b>suppressors</b> make them more desirable than metal oxide varistors.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{tuberous}} sclerosis (TSC) research spans less than 200 years. TSC is a rare, multi-system genetic disease {{that can cause}} benign tumours to grow on the brain or other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, and skin. A combination of symptoms may include seizures, developmental delay, behavioural problems and skin abnormalities, as well as lung and kidney disease. TSC is caused by mutations on either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which encode for the proteins hamartin and tuberin respectively. These proteins act as tumour growth <b>suppressors</b> and regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. Originally regarded as a rare pathological curiosity, it is now an important focus of research into tumour formation and suppression.|$|E
5|$|FLCN {{creates a}} protein called folliculin that has two isoforms. It appears {{to act as}} a tumor {{suppressor}} and is expressed strongly in the skin, distal nephrons, and type I pneumocytes. It has also been found in the parotid gland, brain, breast, pancreas, prostate, and ovaries. Tumor <b>suppressors</b> normally prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in the FLCN gene may interfere with the ability of folliculin to restrain cell growth and division, leading to the formation of noncancerous and cancerous tumors. Recent studies suggest that folliculin accomplishes this function through its involvement with cellular metabolism, possibly through modulation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway and/or oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Folliculin interacts with FNIP1 and FNIP2 (FLCN-interacting protein) to form a complex with AMP-activated protein kinase. Folliculin's participation in the mTOR pathway may explain the similarity in phenotype between BHD syndrome, Cowden syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} investigation supported by basic modeling {{in to the}} performance of an integral <b>suppressor</b> on a low power firearm. A model was developed to determine the pressure within a <b>suppressor</b> chamber using iterative empirical calculations of the gas properties and flow within the system. The design of a reconfigurable <b>suppressor</b> chamber has been undertaken allowing <b>suppressor</b> chamber volume to be varied through the use of baffles. Pressure transducers were used to determine the pressure within the <b>suppressor</b> chamber for a series of firings. The results of the firings with different configurations within the <b>suppressor</b> are presented allowing trends to be established. The modeling and experimental results show an increase in <b>suppressor</b> chamber volume results in a reduction of recorded pressure within the <b>suppressor</b> chamber...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} both the cells and the <b>suppressor</b> factors of the dengue virus-induced <b>suppressor</b> pathway for the {{presence}} of I-region gene products. The <b>suppressor</b> activity of Ts 1, Ts 2 and Ts 3 cells was abrogated by treatment with anti I-Jk or I-Ak anti-sera and complement. Both the <b>suppressor</b> factors were absorbed out by anti I-Jk and I-Ak immunosorbent columns. The activity of the <b>suppressor</b> factor was abolished by treatment with anti I-Jk antisera. Macrophage presentation of <b>suppressor</b> factor to precursors of Ts 2 cells was abolished by treatment with anti I-Ak antisera and complement but not by anti I-Jk antisera. Thus I-region gene products were found throughout the dengue virus induced <b>suppressor</b> pathway...|$|R

5|$|Regulating ER {{release of}} Ca2+ at the MAM is {{especially}} critical because only a certain window of Ca2+ uptake sustains the mitochondria, and consequently the cell, at homeostasis. Sufficient intraorganelle Ca2+ signaling {{is required to}} stimulate metabolism by activating dehydrogenase enzymes critical to flux through the citric acid cycle. However, once Ca2+ signaling in the mitochondria passes a certain threshold, it stimulates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in part by collapsing the mitochondrial membrane potential required for metabolism. Studies examining the role of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors support this model; for example, the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 {{has been shown to}} interact with IP3Rs to reduce Ca2+ filling of the ER, leading to reduced efflux at the MAM and preventing collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential post-apoptotic stimuli. Given the need for such fine regulation of Ca2+ signaling, it is perhaps unsurprising that dysregulated mitochondrial Ca2+ has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, while the catalogue of tumor <b>suppressors</b> includes a few that are enriched at the MAM.|$|E
5|$|The Il-40 first flew on 7 March 1953, {{and flight}} tests {{revealed}} no serious shortcomings in the air. The operational CG {{was too far}} aft, but this was only a minor problem when landing, taking off and taxiing, especially when coupled with the rather short wheelbase. The biggest problem {{proved to be the}} guns and their effect on the engines. During the first aerial test of the cannons at the end of March 1953 the muzzle flash temporarily blinded the pilot and both engines flamed out. The pilot was able to restart the engines and returned safely, but Sergey Ilyushin immediately started an investigation into the cause of the engine problems. Ground tests with high-speed cameras revealed that none of the muzzle brakes or blast <b>suppressors</b> tested made any difference; the engines would hiccup even if only a single gun fired just five to ten rounds.|$|E
5|$|The P90 has {{provisions}} for mounting {{a number of}} different types of accessories, including tactical lights and laser aiming devices. A sling can be attached to the P90 for greater ease of carry, or it can be fitted with various sound <b>suppressors</b> such as the Gemtech SP90, which was designed specifically for the weapon in cooperation with FN Herstal. This stainless steel suppressor with a black oxide finish is built according to MIL-SPECs, including saltwater corrosion resistance. It has a length of 184mm (7.2in), a diameter of 35mm (1.4in) and a weight of 680 g (1.5lb). When subsonic ammunition is used in conjunction with the suppressor, it reduces the sound signature of the P90 by 33dB. A small case collector pouch for the P90 is available which fits over the ejection port and collects spent cases as they are ejected downward; the pouch will collect up to one hundred cases before filling.|$|E

40|$|Specific {{tolerance}} to phosphorylcholine (PC) can be induced in BALB/c mice by neonatal injection with either pneumococcal C-polysaccharide (PnC) or anti-TEPC 15 idiotype (T 15 Id) antibody specific {{for the major}} idiotype (Id) of anti-PC antibody. Spleen cells from these tolerant mice exhibited T cell-mediated active suppression of anti-PC response when they were co-cultured with normal spleen cells. <b>Suppressor</b> cells from the PnC-injected mice appeared to bear either Lyt- 1 or Lyt- 2 antigens, whereas <b>suppressor</b> cells from anti-Id-treated mice expressed Lyt- 2 antigens. Analyses of the specific receptors of these <b>suppressor</b> T cells, based on either adherence to PC and T 15 -coated petri dishes or cytolysis by rabbit anti-T 15 Id and monoclonal IgM anti-PC antibody with complement, revealed that receptors of PnC-induced <b>suppressor</b> T cells recognize PC, whereas receptors of anti-Id-induced <b>suppressor</b> T cells react with the T 15 Id. The possible interaction of the {{two different types of}} <b>suppressor</b> T cells was examined by co-culturing normal spleen cells with mixtures of the different <b>suppressor</b> cell types in various cell ratios {{in the presence of the}} T-independent PC-antigen, R 36 a. A brief incubation of anti-Id-induced, T 15 Id-specific <b>suppressor</b> T cells with PnC-induced, hapten-specific, and T 15 Id-bearing <b>suppressor</b> T cells resulted in complete cancellation of their <b>suppressor</b> function.

40|$|Japanese {{encephalitis}} virus (JEV) infection induces <b>suppressor</b> T-cells (Ts 1) which suppress {{both the}} humoral (Ts-PFC) and cell mediated (Ts-DTH) immune response by producing soluble <b>suppressor</b> factors.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the ease of cloning and characterizing, at the molecular level, helper and cytotoxic T cells, <b>suppressor</b> T cells remain an enigma, and their existence as discrete entities is being increasingly challenged. Here we review evidence that CD 4 + regulatory clones, capable of expressing both helper and <b>suppressor</b> functions, may account {{for much of the}} <b>suppressor</b> function. It is suggested that a single T cell clone, depending on the signals it receives from its environment, may release either helper or <b>suppressor</b> cytokines.
