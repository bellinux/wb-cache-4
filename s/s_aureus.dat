40|$|Patients {{with the}} {{blistering}} disease, epidermolysis bullosa (EB), frequently suffer from chronic wounds that become colonized by pathogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus <b>aureus.</b> To determine <b>S.</b> similar to <b>aureus</b> colonization rates {{in patients with}} EB, swabs were collected from the anterior nares, throats and wounds of 52 Dutch patients with EB. Swabs were also collected from nares and throats of 13 healthcare workers who occasionally meet the sampled patients with EB. All EB patients with chronic wounds and 75 % of the patients without chronic wounds were colonized with <b>S.</b> similar to <b>aureus.</b> In contrast, 39 % of the sampled healthcare workers were colonized with <b>S.</b> similar to <b>aureus.</b> Typing revealed {{a high degree of}} genetic diversity of 184 collected <b>S.</b> similar to <b>aureus</b> isolates. Autoinoculation of <b>S.</b> similar to <b>aureus</b> in individual patients with EB was shown to occur frequently, whereas transmission of <b>S.</b> similar to <b>aureus</b> between patients with EB is apparently rare.

25|$|While <b>S.</b> <b>aureus</b> usually {{acts as a}} {{commensal}} bacterium, asymptomatically colonizing about 30% of {{the human}} population, it can sometimes cause disease.

25|$|Staphylococcus aureus (also {{known as}} golden staph) is a gram-positive, round-shaped {{bacterium}} {{that is a}} member of the Firmicutes, and it {{is a member of}} the normal flora of the body, frequently found in the nose, respiratory tract, and on the skin. It is often positive for catalase and nitrate reduction and is a facultative anaerobe that can grow without the need for oxygen. Although <b>S.</b> <b>aureus</b> is not always pathogenic (and can commonly be found existing as a commensal), it is a common cause of skin infections including abscesses, respiratory infections such as sinusitis, and food poisoning. Pathogenic strains often promote infections by producing virulence factors such as potent protein toxins, and the expression of a cell-surface protein that binds and inactivates antibodies. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of <b>S.</b> <b>aureus</b> such as methicillin-resistant <b>S.</b> <b>aureus</b> (MRSA) is a worldwide problem in clinical medicine.

To guide the antibiotic prophylaxis and vaccinations in children with SCA in Gabon, we characterized Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae from children with and without SCA. We performed a cross-sectional study and compared nasal and pharyngeal <b>S.</b> pneumoniae, Staph. <b>aureus</b> and H. influenzae isolates from SCA children (n = 73) with comparators matched for age, residence and sex (n = 143) in a matched-comparison analysis. The resistance pattern and capsular type were identified for each isolate. The total carriage rate for <b>S.</b> pneumoniae, Staph. <b>aureus</b> and H. influenzae was 13. 8 %, 46. 7 % and 12. 5 %, respectively, and did not differ between groups (p > 0. 05). The mean number of days under antibiotic treatment in the past year was higher in children with SCA than in controls (penicillin: 70. 1 vs 0. 1 days, p 0. 00002). The total non-susceptibility rate was 30 % for oral and parenteral (meningitis) penicillin in S. pneumoniae, resistance rates were 1. 6 % for oxacillin in Staph. aureus and 14. 8 % for ampicillin in H. influenzae. Susceptibility to antibiotic agents and distribution of capsular types did not differ significantly between both groups.
