The influence rules of two factors including the cross <b>sectional</b> area of <b>steel</b> strips and vertical compression were investigated. The results show that, as for unreinforced masonry wall, {{the relationship of the}} shear capacity of unreinforced masonry wall and the vertical compressive strain is linear under lateral load; the speed of stiffness degeneration is accelerated after the peak point of the curves, but decrease with the increasing of lateral displacement. As for masonry wall strengthened with steel strips, the shear capacity increases significantly, and shows nonlinear relationship with the cross section area of the steel strips and vertical compression; ductility is improved. Finally, a computational formula of shear capacity based on a lot of parametric analysis is proposed to calculate the <b>sectional</b> dimension of <b>steel</b> strips, and it provides theoretical foundation for establishing thorough design method of masonry wall strengthened with steel strips...|$|R

Calculations for bending stiffness and flexural stress based on the distribution rate of high-flowability SFRC are recommended.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} {{is widely}} used for bridge piers in Taiwan. Due {{to the requirements of}} strength and ductility for seismic design of RC bridge pier, a large number of reinforcement is usually required. This tight arrangement of reinforcement not only complicates the construction works, it also increases the risk of construction during the erection of the large number of reinforcements. In order to reduce the construction risk due to the collapse of the large reinforcement cage, an innovative steel and reinforced concrete composite bridge pier, which replaces partial vertical reinforcement of the conventional RC pier by the H-shaped <b>sectional</b> <b>steel,</b> was proposed. For the newly developed composite pier, the <b>sectional</b> <b>steel</b> can not only provide the support for the stirrup cage and hold the longitudinal bars during construction, it can also enhance the confinement effect of the inner core concrete.

A promising approach to reduce manufacturing costs, decrease vehicle weight, and {{improve the quality of}} automotive body components is through the use of tailor-welded blanks.

30|$|The use of LIDAR {{elevation}} {{data were}} first reported by Poulter et al. (2006) {{as a method}} to determine the severity of wildfire organic soil combustion. In their study, LIDAR elevation data was used to constrain the estimates of organic soil combustion {{in the absence of}} historical burn depth data for the wildfire. The authors estimated that the vertical accuracy of the LIDAR elevation data was ± 0.15 m, and the horizontal resolution was 6 m, resulting in detectable burn depths of 0.15 m to 0.30 m. The Poulter et al. (2006) study illustrates the difficulty in estimating wildfire C emissions from organic soil combustion. Histosol soils present challenges to the establishment of permanent survey markers because of the deep deposits of mainly organic materials (> 12 % to 18 % C by weight) formed during the Holocene epoch, under conditions of saturation and flooding, that persist today. Stainless <b>steel</b> <b>sectional</b> rod monuments are one method to mark elevations in histosols, but the metal rods themselves introduce survey point bias through the additional heat conduction and resulting soil combustion during a wildfire. In the absence of permanent survey points within the perimeter of the Evans Road Fire, we developed a novel method and approach to estimate C wildfire emissions from organic soil combustion utilizing existing pre-burn LIDAR ground point elevations (vertical accuracy ± 0.10 m to 0.15 m) and co-located post-burn field points using static survey-grade GPS equipment (horizontal and vertical accuracy ± 5 mm). Additional studies are needed to address the detectable burn depths from wildfires using technologies with differing horizontal and vertical elevation accuracies.|$|R
40|$|Steel fiber {{reinforced}} concrete (SFRC) is a multiple-composite material {{developed during the}} early 1970 s. In SFRC, short steel fibers are randomly distributed in concrete. Steel fibers can prevent the development of micro-cracks inside the concrete and reduce the expansion {{and development of the}} macro-cracks, thus enhance mechanical performance of SFRC. However, there is lack of studies on the influence of flowability of fresh SFRC on the steel fiber distribution patterns and mechanical properties of hardened SFRC. In this research, steel fibers made by the thin-plate shearing method are used. Standard specimens are cast in which steel fibers are added to the concrete mix. The slumps ranging from 80 mm to 200 mm are employed as the parameter to reflect the flowability of SFRC. The main research work is as follows: (1) By cutting the specimens in three directions (transverse, horizontal and vertical sections) and quantizing the steel fibers in each section, effects of flowability on steel fiber distribution patterns are assessed. Distribution rate, distribution coefficient and orientation coefficient are the three factors used for describing steel fiber distribution patterns in this research. Calculated results of these factors of different flowability SFRC are summarized and compared. (2) Basic mechanical properties tests including compressive strength, splitting tensile strength and flexural strength tests are conducted for different flowability SFRC. The splitting tensile tests along three directions of specimens of SFRC are carried out in view of the different orientation of steel IV fibers in these directions. Load-deflection curve of flexural toughness test is plotted and analyzed. (3) Two commonly used methods, i. e., ASTM C 1018 (Standard Test Methods for Flexural Toughness and First Crack Strength of Fiber Reinforced Concrete) method and the Chinese Standard JG/T 472 - 2015 (Steel Fiber Reinforced Concrete), are used to access flexural toughness of SFRC. Fracture energy is also calculated. (4) Formulas for calculating moment of inertia and flexural stress of flowable SFRC are proposed. The results show that an increase of flowability has no influence on the orientation of steel fibers and leads to a decrease of <b>sectional</b> uniformity. <b>Steel</b> fibers orientated in a longitudinal direction of higher flowability SFRC tend to precipitate towards the bottom layer of the specimens. This resulted in much better flexural performance including flexural toughness and fracture energy. This would indicate that, instead of studying the entire cross section, the distribution rate and distribution coefficient of steel fibers in tensile zone of specimen should be considered as the main factor determining flexural performance of SFRC. Calculations for bending stiffness and flexural stress based on the distribution rate of high flowability SFRC are recommended. Moreover, due to the layering effect of steel fibers, traditional test methods are not suitable for determining basic mechanical properties such as compressive strength, splitting tensile strength and flexural strength of SFRC, which require further investigations...|$|R
