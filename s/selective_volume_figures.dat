Donati summed up his artistic intentions in this manner: “I am {{trying to use the}} experience of abstract art, superimposing a drawing in the round, and then adding to it points of light to give added volume. What I try to do is to use the system of the Renaissance with modern touches.” This is the interesting point: that Donati imposed his subjects on and out of abstractionism.|$|R

Prior to running causality tests, the time series properties of the data are carefully investigated and special attention {{is given to the}} choice of optimal lag order. Granger causality tests, based on the Toda-Yamamoto (1995) procedure, reveal that there is no causal relationship between the variables in the Czech Republic. In Hungary, there is a bidirectional causality irrespective of volume or market turnover tested. In Poland, while there is bidirectional causality between stock prices and volume, there exists a unidirectional causality running from market turnover to stock prices. The stock prices unidirectionally cause both volume and market turnover without any feedback in the case of Russia and Turkey. These results have important implications regarding market efficiency and the effects of different market characteristics on the stock price/volume relation.

40|$|Purpose: To use a volume-selective 3 D turbo {{spin echo}} (TSE) {{technique}} to image the carotid artery wall and mea-sure distensibility. Materials and Methods: A high-resolution volume-selec-tive 3 D TSE sequence has been developed. Volume selec-tion is accomplished by orthogonal gradients for the 90 ° and 180 ° excitations and allows a 3 D volume of vessel wall to be imaged {{in a relatively short}} time. The technique has been developed to allow imaging at any defined phase of the cardiac cycle so that the vascular function and distensibil-ity can be studied. Results: Scan efficiency is increased by the reduced phase encode field of view (FOV) (ky steps) by the use of <b>selective</b> <b>volume</b> excitation. Significantly more slices (kz phase en-code steps) for vessel coverage can be acquired with the same scan time as that of the conventional sequence while maintaining signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. The practical value of the technique was demonstrated on 10 normal subjects with high-resolution vessel distensibility mea-surements of the carotid arteries. Conclusion: A volume-selective TSE method has been used for carotid artery wall imaging and measurement of disten-sibility in normal subjects. Larger coverage of the vessel, and therefore more information for clinical diagnostics, was achieved with the same overall scan time with an SNR comparable to that of 2 D full FOV images...|$|R

The dynamics of the resulting cosmological model, growing neutrino quintessence, include an attractive force between neutrinos substantially stronger than gravity. We present a comprehensive approach towards an understanding of the full cosmological evolution including the formation of large-scale neutrino structures. Important effects we account for are local variations in the dark energy and the backreaction on the background evolution, as well as relativistic neutrino velocities. For this aim, we develop a relativistic N-body treatment of the neutrinos combined with an explicit computation of the local quintessence field. At its current stage, the simulation method is successful until z ~ 1 and reveals a rich phenomenology. We obtain a detailed picture of the formation of large-scale neutrino structures and their influence on the evolution of matter, dark energy, and the late-time expansion of the universe.
