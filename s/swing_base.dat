40|$|Abstract [...] Remedial action schemes are {{designed}} to avoid wide spread outages after a severe contingency. In practice, these schemes are primarily static. That is, the action is pre-determined for a particular situation based on extensive off-line studies. This paper presents a method for an adaptive scheme based on transient energy analysis suitable for on-line calculations. The approach assumes the system separates into two groups in the first swing after a severe contingency along a key path and that generation tripping and/or load shedding is needed to survive the <b>swing.</b> <b>Based</b> on off-line studies and simple on-line calculations of {{the ability of the}} system to absorb the excess kinetic energy, the amount and location of the generation tripping is determined. This method provides a way to implement an adaptive RAS for different faults and operating points in real-time operation. The IEEE 39 -bus system is used to illustrate the proposed method...|$|R

25|$|Firstly, a batsman needs {{good eye}} {{reflexes}} which {{are considered to}} be a key skill when facing swing bowling. Secondly a batsman often needs to anticipate beforehand what the ball will do and adjust accordingly to play swing bowling. This can be done by observing the bowler's grip and action (which may have a marked difference depending on which type of swinger is to be delivered), by observing the field set, which may depend on the types of deliveries expected (as a rule outswingers will have more slips assigned) or by means of prior knowledge of the bowler; many can bowl or are proficient in only one type of swing. Traditional methods include the batsmen playing the ball as late as possible, and not playing away from the body. Other effective measures for combating swing bowling include standing well outside the crease, thus giving the ball less time to swing; and guessing the direction of <b>swing</b> <b>based</b> on the seam position observed in the ball's flight.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a low-voltage low-power differential linear transconductor with near rail-to-rail input <b>swing.</b> <b>Based</b> on the current-mirror OTA topology, the proposed transconductor combines the Flipped Voltage Follower (FVF) technique to linearize the transconductor behavior {{that leads to}} class-AB linear operation and the virtual transistor technique to lower the effective threshold voltages of the transistors which offers an advantage in terms of low supply requirement. Design of the OTA has been discussed. It operates at supply voltages of about ± 0. 8 V. Simulation results for 0. 18 µm TSMC CMOS technology show a good input range of 1 Vpp with a high DC gain of 81. 53 dB and a total harmonic distortion of- 40 dB at 1 MHz for an input of 1 Vpp. The main aim {{of this paper is}} to present and compare new OTA design with high transconductance, which has a potential to be used in low voltage applications.

50|$|Ceili dances when {{performed}} socially {{are often}} {{performed in a}} progressive style.

When there is a large social gathering, there will often be a caller for the dance, though it is a very different style from square dancing caller. A ceili caller is usually the teacher or most experienced dancer of the group who has the dance memorized. They then call the movements out in a non-stylized way, intended to remind those who are non-dancers when and where to move. Social ceili dances are often the easiest dances and very easy to shuffle through as a non-dancer. A caller makes sure that everyone at a social dance can participate.

30|$|The {{main purpose}} of power swing {{blocking}} is to distinguish faults from power swings. However, the faults occur during a power swing should be detected and cleared promptly. This paper proposes an adaptive concentric power swing blocker (PSB) to overcome incapability of traditional concentric PSB in detecting symmetrical fault during power <b>swing.</b> <b>Based</b> on proposed method, two pairs of concentric characteristics are anticipated which {{the first one is}} placed in a stationary position (outer of zone 3) but the position of the second pair is adjustable. In order to find the position of the second pair of characteristic, Static Phasor Estimation Error (SPEE) of current signal is utilized in this paper. The proposed method detects the abrupt change in SPEE and puts the second pair of characteristic in location of impedance trajectory correspondingly. Second concentric characteristic records travelling time of impedance trajectory between outer and inner zones and compares to threshold value to detect symmetrical fault during power swing. If recorded time is lower than threshold, three-phase fault is detected during power swing. Intensive studies have been performed and the merit of the method is demonstrated by some test signals simulations.|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{data for}} the {{adsorption}} and desorption of CO 2 on potassium promoted hydrotalcite adsorbent were measured under conditions depicting the separation enhanced steam-methane reforming process. Adsorption saturation capacities of 0. 58 and 0. 65 mol/kg were measured at 753 and 673 K, respectively, under wet feed conditions. An ~ 10 % reduction of the saturation capacity was observed under dry feed conditions. In both cases, a Langmuir model adequately described the adsorption isotherm. Experimental data revealed the rapid degradation of the adsorbent under dry feed conditions, and higher losses at higher temperatures. Adsorbent regeneration was possible {{by means of a}} steam purge, but some irreversible loss in capacity was indicated for very long times-on-stream. A dynamic model accounting for semi-technical scale operation was developed to describe the key operating steps of the pressure <b>swing</b> <b>based</b> adsorptive process.
