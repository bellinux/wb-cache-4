50|$|In 1952, in Sacramento, California a {{group of}} Stanford University {{engineering}} and geology graduates founded Exploration Logging Company (EXLOG) to provide geologic mud logging services from mobile logging units using technical innovations in hot-wire gas detection. Vern Jones was the company's first president. EXLOG would become a world leader in <b>surface</b> <b>logging,</b> rig instrumentation and data acquisition. Baker International acquired EXLOG in 1972, and invested in its expansion. By 1982, the company had more than 200 logging units and 1,000 geologists on staff. Its broad expertise in geological services would eventually become the <b>Surface</b> <b>Logging</b> Service product line of Baker Hughes INTEQ.|$|E

This division was called 'INTEQ drilling fluids' which provided the premier brands in oil and gas well drilling muds and wellbore cleaning fluids. In 2003, these product lines were spun off to form the separate entity of Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids (BHDF), with INTEQ continuing as the Drilling and Evaluation (D&E) company. INTEQ provides directional Drilling, MWD/LWD, <b>surface</b> <b>logging</b> (Mudlogging) and coring services.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This is an {{introductory}} article {{of the study}} of smoothable stable <b>log</b> <b>surfaces.</b> First we briefly introduce the projectivity of the moduli functor of smoothable stable <b>log</b> <b>surfaces</b> with given Hilbert function. The positivity of the second Chern class of stable <b>log</b> <b>surfaces</b> and its relation of boundedness are discussed. Also the study of limits of plane curves by using smoothable stable <b>log</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and the construction of surfaces by using smoothable stable surfaces are shortly discussed. It has been {{known for a long time}} that the set of all curves of a fixed genus g nat-urally corresponds to the points on a certain variety with dimension 3 g− 3, which is denoted by Mg. The moduli space Mg is not projective, and there has been consid-erable work in finding a natural compactification. What kind of curves correspon...|$|R

40|$|Social {{interactions}} among animals can influence {{their response to}} disturbance. We investigated responses of long-finned pilot whales to killer whale sound playbacks and two anthropogenic sources of disturbance: Tagging effort and naval sonar exposure. The acoustic scene and diving behaviour of tagged individuals were recorded along with the social behaviour of their groups. All three disturbance types resulted in larger group sizes, increasing social cohesion during disturbance. However, the nature and magnitude of other responses differed between disturbance types. Tagging effort resulted in a clear increase in synchrony and a tendency to reduce <b>surface</b> <b>logging</b> and to become silent (21 % of cases), whereas pilot whales increased surface resting during sonar exposure. Killer whale sounds elicited increased calling rates and the aggregation of multiple groups, which approached the sound source together. This behaviour appears to represent a mobbing response, a likely adaptive social defence against predators or competitors. All observed response-Tactics would reduce risk of loss of group coordination, suggesting that, in social pilot whales, this could drive behavioural responses to disturbance. However, the behavioural means used to achieve social coordination depends upon other considerations, which are disturbance-specific...|$|E

40|$|This {{work was}} {{initially}} motivated by Miranda's work on elliptic Weierstrass threefolds. Miranda [Mi] describes a smooth equidimensional (flat) model for any elliptic Weierstrass threefold; such models occur naturally {{in the study}} of moduli spaces. In this paper we use minimal model theory to link birational maps of <b>log</b> <b>surfaces</b> (<b>log</b> contractions) to equidimensional fibrations of elliptic threefolds. As a corollary we show that an elliptic fibration of positive Kodaira dimension has a minimal model with an equidimensional birationally equivalent elliptic fibration satisfying certain good properties that naturally generalize the case of elliptic fibrations of surfaces. We apply the results to the case of Weierstrass models and give a global explanation of Miranda's algorithm. Comment: 21 pages, AmS-Te...|$|R

50|$|Lalande 21185 is {{a typical}} type-M main-sequence star (red dwarf) with about 46% {{of the mass of}} the Sun and is much cooler than the Sun at 3,828 K. It is {{intrinsically}} dim with an absolute magnitude of 10.48, emitting most of its energy in the infrared. Lalande 21185 is a high-proper-motion star moving at about 5 arc seconds a year in an orbit perpendicular to the plane of the Milky Way. The proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium is estimated based on the ratio of iron to hydrogen in the star when compared to the Sun. The logarithm of this ratio is −0.20, indicating that the proportion of iron is about 10−0.20, or 63% of the Sun. The surface gravity of this relatively compact star is approximately 65 times greater than the gravity at Earth's <b>surface</b> (<b>log</b> g = 4.8 cgs), which is more than twice the surface gravity of our Sun.|$|R

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the moisture content, wood density of corresponding moisture content and modulus of elasticity in standing trees using vibrational spectra. For the preliminary tests, fixed length and diameter logs were used for the following experiments. The logs were impregnated with water at normal pressure and the vibration tests were carried out at fixed intervals while the logs were left to dry under room conditions. The statistical models for the prediction of the wood properties were built using the vibration spectra generated from three excitation methods, namely, excitation of longitudinal vibration by hitting the transverse <b>surface</b> of <b>logs,</b> and excitation of lateral vibration or longitudinal vibration by hitting the <b>log’s</b> lateral <b>surface.</b> The Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and PLS (partial least squares) models could predict the moisture content and density independently of the excitation, with the exception of the modulus of elasticity. The vibrational spectra obtained by hitting the lateral <b>surface</b> of <b>logs</b> could give good prediction models, indicating that the techniques suggested in this study have high potential for application to standing trees.|$|R
40|$|Varieties with log {{terminal}} and log canonical singularities are {{considered in the}} Minimal Model Program, see [...] . for introduction. In shokurov:hyp it was conjectured {{that many of the}} interesting sets, associated with these varieties have something in common: they satisfy the ascending chain condition, which means that every increasing chain of elements terminates. Philosophically, this is the reason why two main hypotheses in the Minimal Model Program: existence and termination of flips should be true and are possible to prove. In this paper we prove that the following two sets satisfy the ascending chain condition: 1. The set of minimal log discrepancies for K_X+B where X is a <b>surface</b> with <b>log</b> canonical singularities. 2. The set of groups (b_ 1, [...] . b_s) such that there is a <b>surface</b> X with <b>log</b> canonical and numerically trivial K_X+∑ b_jB_j. The order on such groups is defined in a natural way.
