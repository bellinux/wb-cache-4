5|$|In {{colonial times}} Mayan {{languages}} {{came to be}} written in a script derived from the Latin alphabet; orthographies were developed mostly by missionary grammarians. Not all modern Mayan languages have <b>standardized</b> orthographies, but the Mayan languages of Guatemala use a <b>standardized,</b> Latin-based phonemic spelling system developed by the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala (ALMG). Orthographies for the languages of Mexico are currently being developed by the Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas (INALI).|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{important}} for time to be <b>standardized</b> across time zones so that {{the information on the}} map should accurately represent the weather at a given time. A <b>standardized</b> time system was first used to coordinate the British railway network in 1847, with the inauguration of Greenwich Mean Time.|$|E

40|$|Standards {{have become}} {{critical}} to {{information and communication}} technologies (ICTs) as they become complex and pervasive. We propose a process theory framework to explain anticipatory <b>standardizing</b> outcomes post hoc when the <b>standardizing</b> process is viewed as networks of events. Anticipatory standards define future capabilities for ICT ex ante in contrast to ex post <b>standardizing</b> existing practices or capabilities through de facto standardization in the market. The theoretical framework offers the following: a) a lexicon {{in the form of the}} ontology and typology of <b>standardizing</b> events; b) a grammar, or a set of combination rules, for <b>standardizing</b> events to build process representations; c) an analysis and appreciation of contexts in which <b>standardizing</b> unfolds; and d) logic yielding theoretical explanations of <b>standardizing</b> outcomes based on the analysis of process representations. We show how the framework can help analyze standardization data as networks of events as well as explain <b>standardizing</b> outcomes. We illustrate the plausibility of the approach by applying it to wireless standardization to explain <b>standardizing</b> outcomes...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to <b>standardizing</b> pipeline description, {{there is a}} move to <b>standardize</b> and enable completely reproducible execution environments through software containers such as Docker. Although not yet widely adopted, containerized bioinformatics tools simplify deployment, sharing, and reusing of tools between research groups. We believe that <b>standardizing</b> the execution environment, together with <b>standardizing</b> the pipeline descriptions, is a key feature for reproducible research in bioinformatics.|$|R

5|$|HDMI 1.0 and 1.1 are {{restricted}} to transmitting only certain video formats, defined in EIA/CEA-861-B and in the HDMI Specification itself. HDMI 1.2 and all later versions allow any arbitrary resolution and frame rate (within the bandwidth limit); any formats that are {{not supported by the}} HDMI Specification (i.e. no <b>standardized</b> timings defined) may be implemented as a vendor-specific format. Although successive versions of the HDMI Specification continue to add support for additional formats (such as 4K resolutions), the added support is to establish <b>standardized</b> timings to ensure interoperability between products, not to establish what formats are and aren't permitted, and video formats do not require explicit support from the HDMI Specification in order to be displayed.|$|E

50|$|However, by {{introducing}} airframer defined ACARS messages (e.g. by the A380) {{and because of}} the increasing need to connect airline handling partners like fuel suppliers or de-icing companies, a need to <b>standardize</b> appeared.

50|$|If {{both of the}} {{independent}} variables are continuous, it is helpful for interpretation to either center or <b>standardize</b> {{the independent}} variables, X and Z. (Centering involves subtracting the overall sample mean score from the original score; <b>standardizing</b> does the same followed by dividing by the overall sample standard deviation.) By centering or <b>standardizing</b> the independent variables, the coefficient of X or Z can be interpreted as the effect of that variable on Y at the mean level of the other independent variable.|$|R
