40|$|Unrestricted or {{so-called}} trimmed mopeds and speeding {{are experienced}} as an increasing traffic safety problem. There {{is a risk}} of an increased number of seriously injured and casualties among adolescents {{as a consequence of}} the increased number of mopeds found in traffic today and the higher speeds they are driven at. One common police action to reduce trimming is to follow the moped riders who are suspected of altering their vehicles. This can lead to "chase situations" which increase the risk to both moped riders and fellow road-users. One purpose of this report is to study the effects of an alternative way of working with the moped problems by the police in four different towns and by interviews, observations and a questionnaire study broaden our knowledge about attitudes to moped riding and trimming among youths. The results showed that the efforts of the police in the experiment towns had not had any effect on the attitudes and the points of view of the youths towards traffic safety. One possible reason for this is that the method used is too new and that it was not extensive enough. Parents have an effect on the attitude of the youths towards trimming. The parents of those who trim seem to have a more tolerant attitude towards trimming. The results from the questionnaire study show that those that had driven but do not a moped but did not have av moped of their own, as well as those who have a trimmed moped of their own were more positive towards taking risks in traffic, would consider driving at faster speeds and had more experience of traffic offenses. In addition, they are of the opinion that parents, friends and fellow roadusers find it acceptable to exceed the speed limits. Furthermore, these two groups were not as involved in organised leisure activities as the other two groups, their parents were not as strict, grades were not considered as important and they indicated to a greater degree that attending school is difficult or boring. Based on this study, it can be concluded that trimming is not an isolated behaviour but related to a certain lifestyle. In order to reduce trimming an increased understanding of those mechanisms which determine the behaviour of the target groups are needed as well as improved methods to detect trimming. Qualitative studies could be used to discuss the problem with parents, youths and those living in <b>special</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> where the problem is experienced as being widespread. It might also be interesting to analyse incoming calls/complaints to police communication centres and evaluate the effects police work has on the number of trimmed mopeds over a period of time...|$|R

Similarly, when {{the population}} in urban areas assume {{that the city is}} no longer comfortable to their live, so the only possible choice for them is moving to suburb.

40|$|This report {{gives an}} {{overview}} {{of knowledge about the}} relationship between traffic signs, carriageway markings and road safety. Traffic signs and carriageway markings are intended to convey their messages as effectively as possible. The road environment has a major influence on whether or not road users are able to quickly register traffic signs. The following measures can be applied to improve the contribution of traffic signs to road safety: (1) making a distinction between important and less important traffic signs; (2) improving the design of these signs to make them more noticeable, recognisable and understandable; (3) placing speed limit signs everywhere at the entrance to a carriageway or to an area, and repeating them where necessary; (4) reinforcing the message on the sign by means of other, more natural indicators; and (5) replacing some of the road signs by road markings whose message is intended to be read at different times of the day or night. Road markings can also contribute to road safety, provided that they are restricted to special situations and are integrated into a package of various local measures. `Special situations' can include warnings of <b>special</b> restrictions in <b>residential</b> <b>areas,</b> entry into a lower speed limit area, the approach to sharp bends on a road with an 80 km/h speed limit, or temporary road works...|$|R
