40|$|A sealed, low {{maintenance}} battery (10, 100) is formed of a casing (14, 102) having a sealed lid (12, 104) enclosing cell compartments (22, 110) formed by walls (24, 132). The cells comprise a stack (26) of horizontally disposed negative active plates (30) and positive active plates (28) interspersed with porous, resilient separator sheets (30). Each plate has {{a set of}} evenly spaced tigs (40, 41) disposed on one side thereof; like polarity tigs being disposed {{on one side and}} opposite polarity tigs on the other. Columns of tigs are electrically and mechanically joined by vertical bus bars (46). The bus bars contain outwardly projecting arms (56) of opposite polarity which are electrically joined at each partition wall (24) to electrically connect the cells in series. The stack is compressed by biasing means such as resilient pad (58) attached to the lid or by joining the tigs (52) to the post (48) at a distance less than the thickness of the mat (124). The end bus bars (46) are joined to straps (60, 62) which connect to the terminals (16, 18). The negative plates contain more capacity than the positive plates and the starved electrolyte imbibed in the separator sheets permits pressurized operation during which oxygen diffuses through the <b>separator</b> <b>sheet</b> to the negative plate where it recombines. Excess pressure is relieved through the vent and pressure relief valve (20) ...|$|E
50|$|To allow {{efficient}} stacking {{of product}} in the furnace during sintering and prevent parts sticking together, many manufacturers separate ware using ceramic powder <b>separator</b> <b>sheets.</b> These sheets are available in various materials such as alumina, zirconia and magnesia. They are additionally categorized by fine, medium and coarse particle sizes. By matching the material and particle size to the ware being sintered, surface damage and contamination can be reduced while maximizing furnace loading.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{heat and}} fluid flow {{in a small}} cabinet is {{simulated}} using Computational Fluid Dynamics software FLUENT. Various cabinet designs are proposed by positioning the different type of exhaust fans, air <b>separator</b> <b>sheets</b> and cabinet air inlet in various sizes. Aerothermal analysis is performed for the proposed cabinets to reach desired flow conditions at the inlet of the devices placed in the cabinet. Promising cabinet design results obtained {{at the end of}} these analyses are given with a sample results for comparison in this article.

40|$|Aims. Photospheric motions {{acting on}} the coronal {{magnetic}} field {{have the potential to}} build up huge amounts of magnetic energy. The energy may be released through magnetic reconnection, and so a detailed understanding of the 3 D process is crucial if its implications for coronal heating are to be fully addressed. Methods. A 3 D MHD experiment is described in which misaligned magnetic flux tubes are subjected to simple spinning boundary motions. Results. The resulting shear between adjacent flux systems generates a twisted central <b>separator</b> current <b>sheet</b> that extends vertically throughout the domain. Current density is amplified to a sufficient extent that reconnection begins, and occurs everywhere along the <b>separator</b> current <b>sheet,</b> while the separatrix current sheets that exist {{in the early stages of}} the experiment are found to be unimportant in the systems dynamical evolution. In 2 D cross-sections, the reconnection process exhibits many similarities to the regime of flux pile-up reconnection...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{initiated}} to develop alternative separator materials to the previously used asbestos matrices which {{were removed from}} the market for health and environmental reasons. The objective of the research was to find a material or combination of materials that had the following characteristics: (1) resistant to the severe conditions encountered in Ni-H 2 cells; (2) satisfactory electrical, electrolyte management, and thermal management properties to function properly; (3) environmentally benign; and (4) capable of being manufactured into a separator matrix. During the course of the research it was discovered that separators prepared from wettable polyethylene fibers along and in combination with potassium titanate pigment performed satisfactory in preliminary characterization tests. Further studies lead to the optimization of the separator composition and manufacturing process. Single ply <b>separator</b> <b>sheets</b> were manufactured with 100 percent polyethylene fibers and also with a combination of polyethylene fibers and potassium titanate pigment (PKT) in the ratio of 60 percent PKT and 40 percent fibers. A pilot paper machine was used to produce the experimental separator material by a continuous, wet laid process. Both types of matrices were produced at several different area densities (grams/sq m) ...|$|R

30|$|MFC used in {{the present}} study was a cassette-electrode (CE) reactor (approximately 1.5  L in water content; panels b and c in Fig.  1) that were {{equipped}} with 6 CEs prepared as described elsewhere (Shimoyama et al. 2008; Miyahara et al. 2013). As indicated with arrows in Fig.  1 c, water flowed up and down between CEs and partition boards in CE-MFC. A CE had two anode/separator/cathode sets on both sides, between which air was filled (5  mm in thickness). An anode (126  cm 2 in area) was made of a graphite-felt sheet (3  mm in thickness; Sohgoh Carbon, Yokohama, Japan), while a cathode (126  cm 2) was an air cathode produced as described previously (Cheng et al. 2006). A <b>separator</b> (punctured polypropylene <b>sheets,</b> 1  mm in thickness) was used to separate between an anode and cathode. The water surface in CE-MFC was covered with floating boards to reduce the exposure to oxygen (Miyahara et al. 2015).|$|R
