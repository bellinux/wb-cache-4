These two groups, contrary to the original Puntarenas Pact were controlled by the Sandinistas and trained by personnel from Cuba, Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union. Opposition to the overwhelming FSLN influence in the security forces did not surface until 1980.|$|E

It was used by the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution (AGIR) and the militia Basij of Iran against the Army and the Republican Guard of Iraq in the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88). In Nicaragua the <b>Sandinista</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Army</b> (SPA in English {{language}} and EPS in the Spanish language) used Type 58 weapons against the Contras in the Sandinista Revolution (1980-90).|$|E

5000|$|Humberto Ortega and his brother, current President of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, {{founded the}} Tercerista {{tendency}} of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) in 1975. He, among others leaders, crafted the urban insurrection strategy that ignited civil war in Nicaragua in October 1977 {{which led to the}} fall of the Somoza dynastic dictatorship in July 1979. As Minister of Defense during the decade of Sandinista rule, Ortega oversaw the buildup of the <b>Sandinista</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Army</b> (EPS) and the prosecution of the war against the [...] "contra" [...] resistance factions and their peasant support base.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Sandinista</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Army</b> (or People's Army; , EPS) was the {{military}} established in 1979 {{by the new}} Sandinista government to replace the National Guard, following the overthow of Anastasio Somoza Debayle. In post-Sandinista Nicaragua, it has been remolded into the National Army of Nicaragua. Joaquín Cuadra was chief of staff, serving Defense Minister Humberto Ortega. A draft, called the Patriotic Military Service (...) , (SMP) was instituted in 1983. It later became Obligatory Military Service (Servicio Militar Obligatorio) (SMO). The special forces Tropas Pablo Ubeda initially came under the Ministry of Interior and then the BLI'S were Created.|$|E
50|$|Under an {{agreement}} between President-elect Chamorro of the National Opposition Union (Unión Nacional Oppositora—UNO) and the defeated FSLN party, General Humberto Ortega, former defense minister and {{commander in chief of}} the EPS under the Sandinistas, remained at the head of the armed forces. By a law that took effect in April 1990, the EPS became subordinate to President Chamorro as commander in chief. Chamorro also retained the Ministry of Defense portfolio. Chamorro's authority over the EPS was, however, very limited. There were no Ministry of Defense offices and no vice ministers to shape national defense policies or exercise civilian control over the armed forces.

50|$|In 1979 {{after the}} victory of the <b>Sandinista</b> <b>Popular</b> Revolution, begins in higher {{education}} a profound transformation of the entire system. The most significant elements of this transformation are as follows:- Creation of the National Council for Higher Education (CNES, by its initials in Spanish) with the purpose of regulating and controlling the academic, financial and administrative activities of higher education institutions in the country.- Separation of UNAN in two campus: UNAN-León and UNAN-Managua with the intention that both campuses would be autonomous.- Return to annual regime and blocks system removing the semester regime and the credit system.- Conformation of new curricula and programs of subjects from defining the areas of occupation of each of the specialties.- Relocation of careers and training courses to non-university centers involved.|$|R

50|$|At {{the height}} of the {{conflict}} with the <b>Sandinista</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Army</b> (Ejército Popular Sandinista, EPS), in the mid-1980s Contra forces reportedly totaled between 12,000 and 17,000 (depending on the source of the estimate); this level rivaled that of the entire Honduran armed forces. This fact — and the continued close ties between Honduras and the United States — made it doubtful that the armed forces would expel the Nicaraguan rebels from Honduran territory by force. However, the prospect of an EPS victory over the Contras (which most observers considered inevitable) raised the disturbing prospect of a foreign armed force trapped on Honduran soil. Most Hondurans believed that, under such circumstances, the Nicaraguans would fail to assimilate well into the Honduran population and would resort to banditry in order to survive. Honduran politicians had little faith in the willingness of the United States to assist them, should events take such a negative turn. Most believed that following a Contra defeat, Washington would cut its losses and withdraw all support from the group.|$|E
5000|$|El Pueblo {{was shut}} down briefly by the {{government}} on July 23, 1979. On January 21, 1980 the Sandinista government banned the newspaper, on the ground of having incited economic sabotage. Frente Obrero had defied government orders for restraint by organizing strikes at the San Antonio sugar mills and Monterrosa plantations. MAP-ML were accused {{by the government of}} being 'ultra-leftists and financed by the Communist Party of China'. On January 23, 1980 the office of El Pueblo in Managua was raided and its printing presses and office equipment were confiscated by soldiers from the <b>Sandinista</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Army.</b> Two journalists and one office assistant were arrested in the army raid. Various persons linked to El Pueblo were charged with counter-revolutionary activities. Wallace, Cuadra and two Frente Obrero leaders (Isidro Téllez and Juan Alberto Enríquez) were charged by the Masaya Court of Appeals, on the ground of articles published in El Pueblo issue no. 159 published on January 5, 1980 (which had argued that the price of coffee had been reduced by the Sandinista Front as retaliation of the plantation workers' militancy, and that the government was not fulfilling its promises of land redistribution) and in issue no. 179 published on January 19, 1980 (which criticized the discourse of the national literacy campaign, arguing in favour slogans calling for the end of latifundio). The court considered the articles as having a 'potentially destabilizing effect on the Government'.|$|E

2500|$|On 12 January 1981, the Ejército Popular Boricua (Boricua <b>Popular</b> <b>Army),</b> a Puerto Rican separatist organization, {{carried out}} {{multiple}} bombings at the Muniz Air National Guard Base. [...] At the time, {{it was the}} largest attack on U.S. military forces since the Vietnam War. The attack was timed to coincide with the birthday of the Puerto Rican independence advocate Eugenio María de Hostos. [...] The attack incurred approximately $45,000,000 damage to ten A-7D aircraft and a single F-104 by eleven commandos of the <b>Popular</b> <b>Army</b> of Puerto Rico, also known as [...] "The Macheteros." [...] The unit was equipped with eighteen A-7D and one F-104 aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Because the machete {{is common}} in many {{tropical}} countries, it is often the weapon of choice for uprisings. For example, the Boricua <b>Popular</b> <b>Army</b> are unofficially called macheteros because of the machete-wielding laborers of sugar cane fields of past Puerto Rico.|$|R
