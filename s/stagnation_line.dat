50|$|Sailboats {{often have}} a jib that {{overlaps}} the mainsail—called a genoa. Arvel Gentry demonstrated in 1981 that the genoa and the mainsail interact in a symbiotic manner, owing to the circulation of air between them slowing down in {{the gap between the}} two sails (contrary to traditional explanations), which prevents separation of flow along the mainsail. The presence of a jib causes the <b>stagnation</b> <b>line</b> on the mainsail to move forward, which reduces the suction velocities on the main and reduces the potential for boundary layer separation and stalling. This allows higher angles of attack. Likewise, the presence of the mainsail causes the <b>stagnation</b> <b>line</b> on the jib to be shifted forward and allows the boat to point closer to the wind, owing to higher leeward velocities of the air over both sails.|$|E

A heat transfer model with a cylindrical leading edge was tested in a low speed wind tunnel at Reynolds numbers ranging from 67, 750 to 142, 250 based on leading edge diameter of the model. Grids of parallel rods with diameters 2. 86 cm, 1. 59 cm and 0. 95 cm were used to generate the freestream turbulence with well-defined primary vortex lines. The grids were placed at several locations upstream of the heat transfer model in orientations where the rods were perpendicular and parallel to the <b>stagnation</b> <b>line.</b> Hot-wire anemometry {{was used to measure}} the turbulence characteristics of the freestream turbulence. The freestream turbulence was characterized using the turbulence intensity, integral length scale, lateral velocity and vorticity fluctuating component. The turbulence intensity and the ratio of integral length scale to leading edge diameter were in the range of 3. 93 to 11. 78 % and 0. 07 to 0. 7, respectively. Characteristics of coherent vortical structures downstream of the grids were examined by analyzing the isotropy of turbulence, lateral velocity and vorticity fluctuating components and the wavelet energy spectra of the lateral fluctuating velocity components downstream of the turbulence grids. Heat transfer coefficients were estimated by measuring the temperature distribution and the heat flux. The grids with rods perpendicular to the <b>stagnation</b> <b>line,</b> where the primary vortical structures are expected to be perpendicular to the <b>stagnation</b> <b>line,</b> result in higher heat transfer than those with rods parallel to the <b>stagnation</b> <b>line.</b> The difference between the two grid orientations was more pronounced for the bigger rod-grids.

40|$|When {{a closed}} body or a duct {{envelope}} {{moves through the}} atmosphere, air pressure and temperature rises occur ahead of the body or, under ram conditions, within the duct. If cloud water droplets are encountered, droplet evaporation will result because of the air-temperature rise and the relative velocity between the droplet and stagnating air. It is shown that {{the solution of the}} steady-state psychrometric equation provides evaporation rates which are the maximum possible when droplets are entrained in air moving along <b>stagnation</b> <b>lines</b> under such conditions. Calculations are made {{for a wide variety of}} water droplet diameters, ambient conditions, and flight Mach numbers. Droplet diameter, body size, and Mach number effects are found to predominate, whereas wide variation in ambient conditions are of relatively small significance in the determination of evaporation rates. The results are essentially exact for the case of movement of droplets having diameters smaller than about 30 microns along relatively long ducts (length at least several feet) or toward large obstacles (wings), since disequilibrium effects are then of little significance. Mass losses in the case of movement within ducts will often be significant fractions (one-fifth to one-half) of original droplet masses, while very small droplets within ducts will often disappear even though the entraining air is not fully stagnated. Wing-approach evaporation losses will usually be of the order of several percent of original droplet masses. Two numerical examples are given of the determination of local evaporation rates and total mass losses in cases involving cloud droplets approaching circular cylinders along <b>stagnation</b> <b>lines.</b> The cylinders chosen were of 3. 95 -inch (10. 0 + cm) diameter and 39. 5 -inch 100 + cm) diameter. The smaller is representative of icing-rate measurement cylinders, while with the larger will be associated an air-flow field similar to that ahead of an airfoil having a leading-edge radius comparable with that of the cylinder. It is found that the losses are less than 5 percent. It is concluded that such losses are, in general, very small (less than 1 percent) in the case of smaller obstacles (of icing-rate measurement- cylinder size); the motional dynamics are such, however, that exceptions will occur by reason of failure of very small droplets (moving along <b>stagnation</b> <b>lines)</b> to impinge upon obstacle surfaces. In such cases, the droplets will evaporate completely...|$|R

40|$|Convective cooling through {{liquid jet}} {{impingement}} {{is the preferred}} method for achieving high rates of heat transfer in many practical applications. This study focuses {{on some of the}} fundamental issues that most influence impingement heat transfer to a free-surface jet, both in the absence and presense of phase change. ^ For single-phase convection, primary emphasis is on the relationship between jet turbulence and local impingement heat transfer for a free-surface, planar jet of water. Employing a thermal anemometer system, measurements of the mean velocity and turbulence intensity are reported at different streamwise and spanwise locations throughout the jet. The flow conditions at the nozzle discharge were controlled by using different nozzle designs (parallel-plate and converging) and flow manipulators (wire and and screens). Flows involving turbulence manipulators (wires and screens), although exhibiting very high initial turbulence levels (as high as 12 %), experience large rates of turbulent decay such that, within about 5 to 10 nozzle widths, the turbulence intensity declined to approximately 2 %. Despite streamwise turbulence intensities within the jet that differed by as much as 345 %, the influence on the <b>stagnation</b> <b>line</b> convection coefficient is limited to enhancements of less than 44 %. Correlation of the results yielded approximately a one-quarter power dependence of the <b>stagnation</b> <b>line</b> convection coefficient on turbulence intensity. ^ For two-phase convection, local boiling curves are presented at several streamwise distances from the <b>stagnation</b> <b>line</b> and are complemented by distributions of the surface temperature and convection coefficient along the surface at several heat fluxes. The position downstream of the <b>stagnation</b> <b>line</b> influenced heat transfer predominantly in the single-phase convection regime and had no appreciable effect on fully-developed nucleate boiling. Surface location was shown to influence the extent of the partial boiling regime. The effect of jet velocity on heat transfer was most pronounced in the single-phase and partial boiling regimes, where convective transport is dominated by the hydrodynamics of the bulk flow and not bubble motion. Within the fully-developed boiling regime, heat transfer was insensitive to jet velocity because the convective transport was dominated by intense mixing induced by bubbles leaving the surface. ...|$|E

The emission signatures of H, NH, and OH are characteristic for pyrolysis gases and consequently were only observed {{in front of the}} PICA samples. CN and C were found in front of both materials and are mainly due to interactions of the carbon fibers with the plasma. In all tests with instrumented samples, the emission of Mn, Cr, and Ni was observed when the thermocouple temperatures reached or exceeded ~ 1, 500 K, strongly indicating erosion of the molten thermocouple tips. Temperatures in the post-shock layer were estimated from comparing the CN band emission to spectral simulation.

40|$|Important {{features}} {{associated with}} the segregation of particles in turbulent flow are investigated by considering the statistical distribution (phase-space number density) of particles subject to the combined effects of straining flow and stochastic forcing. A Fokker-Planck model is used to obtain results for the phase-space distributions of particles that are entrained into straining flow fields. The analysis shows that, {{in marked contrast to}} the zero strain case, nonsingular steady-state distributions are generated, and also confirms that the diffusional effect resulting from the stochastic forcing is sufficient to offset the otherwise singular distributions that would result from the indefinite accumulation of particles along <b>stagnation</b> <b>lines.</b> The influence of particle inertia (Stokes number) on the form of the resulting distributions is considered and several significant results are observed. The influence of the strain rate on the attenuation of particle kinetic stresses is quantified and explained. The development of large third-order velocity moments is observed for Stokes numbers above a critical value. The mechanism underlying the phenomenon is seen to be a generic feature of particle transport in flows where vortex structures induce local counterflows of particles.

40|$|DNS {{studies of}} {{dispersed}} particle motion in isotropic homogeneous turbulence [1] have revealed {{the existence of}} a component of random uncorrelated motion (RUM) dependent on the particle inertia τp(normalised particle response time or Stoke number). This paper reports the presence of RUM in a simple linear random smoothly varying flow field of counter rotating vortices where the two-particle velocity correlation was measured as a function of spatial separation. Values of the correlation less than one for zero separation indicated the presence of RUM. In terms of Stokes number, the motion of the particles in one direction corresponds to either a heavily damped (τp 0. 25) harmonic oscillator. In the lightly damped case the particles overshoot the <b>stagnation</b> <b>lines</b> of the flow and are projected from one vortex to another (the so-called sling-shot effect). It is shown that RUM occurs only when τp > 0. 25, increasing monotonically with increasing Stokes number. Calculations of the particle pair separation distribution function show that equilibrium of the particle concentration field is never reached, the concentration at zero separation increasing monotonically with time. This is consistent with the calculated negative values of the average Liapounov exponent (finite compressibility) of the particle velocity field.

A simple superposition of a planar Couette flow and Moffatt's [J. Fluid Mech. 18, 1 [...] 18 (1964) ] streamfunction for the decay of a disturbance between infinite stationary parallel plates shows that in general the <b>stagnation</b> <b>line</b> is replaced by a chain of alternating elliptic and hyperbolic stagnation points with a separation equal to 2. 78 times the half-gap between the plates. The flow structure associated with each saddle point consists of a homoclinic separatrix and two other separatrices which locally diverge but become parallel far from the disturbance. This basic structure repeats to give a sequence of nested separatrices permitting the streamfunction to approach that of simple shear flow far from the disturbance. Using the finite element method, the specific disturbance caused by a stationary cylinder placed on the <b>stagnation</b> <b>line</b> is considered, and results confirm the existence of the stagnation point chain, with computed separations and velocity damping ratios in very good agreement with those obtained from the Couette-Moffatt superposition. Numerical solutions also illustrate that while Reynolds number greatly affects the stagnation point separation and velocity damping ratio, these two quantities are the same for any pair of adjacent stagnation points in a given chain. Insight gained from the analysis of planar shear flows is applied to the flow in a half-filled horizontal annulus between rotating coaxial cylinders, and is used to explain why only certain flow patterns from the range of mathematically possible structures arise in previous numerical solutions. By way of contrast, the concentric annulus solution is then perturbed to allow for a small eccentricity.

This method {{can be considered as}} being a special development of particle image velocimetry (PIV). Instead of having a light sheet illuminating a cross section {{in the center of the}} flow, here, we illuminate the particles near to the wall. Using a fluid, which permits the light to penetrate only the fluid close to the wall, makes this selection. Water is mixed with black Indian ink allowing the light to penetrate only about 0, 5 mm. A transparent flow model is illuminated from the outside by a diffuse light source. The light illuminates only the wall region, so that only the particles moving close to the wall are seen. Reflecting particles are used. The size of the particles is of the same order as the depth of light penetration. The flow is recorded with a digital video camera. The resulting images are processed using the Particle Image Velocimetry. A vector field of the flow close to the wall is the result. Comparison between standard flow visualization and the new method in a laminar pipe flow. The flow direction is perpendicular to the plane of this figure. The results of experiments in different flows show the viability of the method. The direction of the flow at the wall can be assessed very well, as well as the detection of the <b>stagnation</b> <b>lines</b> and flow separation zones. Since such zones are linked to lesions of the wall, this new method can serve as a tool to investigate the flow related causes for alterations of the wall...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to evaluate the heat-transfer rates {{at the apex of}} two 60 degree sweptback delta wings (panel semi-apex angle of 30 degrees) having cylindrical leading edges and 0 degrees and 45 degree positive dihedral. The models tested might correspond to the first several feet of a hypersonic reentry vehicle. The tests were conducted at a Mach number of 4. 95 and a stagnation temperature of 400 F. nominal test-section unit Reynolds numbers varied from 2 x 10 (exp 6) to 12 x 10 (exp 6) per foot. The results of the investigation indicated that the laminar heat-transfer distributions (ratio of local to stagnation-line heating rate) about the models normal to the leading edges were in close agreement with two-dimensional blunt-body theory. The three-dimensional stagnation point heat-transfer rate on the 0 degree dihedral model was in excellent agreement with theory and the stagnation-line heat transfer on the straight portion of the leading edge of both models approached a constant level 12 percent above the theoretical stagnation-line level on an isolated swept infinite cylinder. When the heating rates on the 45 degree dihedral model (planform sweep of 69. 3 degree) were compared with those on the 0 degree dihedral model (planform sweep of 60 degrees) at equal angles of attack and equal lifts greater than zero, the stagnation-line heating rates on the 45 degrees dihedral model were, in general, considerably lower {{as a result of the}} difference in effective sweeps of the leading edges. On the wing panels inboard from the <b>stagnation</b> <b>lines,</b> the differences in heating were very small. The stagnation-line heat-transfer variation with angle of attack, the shift in stagnation-line location, and the reduction in stagnation-line heat transfer resulting from the increase in effective sweep when positive dihedral is incorporated into a constant-panel 0 degree dihedral wing, all agreed with the results of a theoretical study made of highly swept delta wings with large positive dihedral...|$|R

Rational fractions are employed for series summation and analytic continuation. Angles of incidence up to 30 deg and Mach numbers as low as 2 have been considered. The maximum-entropy streamline will not wet the body surface in asymmetric flow. It may pass either above or below the <b>stagnation</b> streamline.

The probe is formed from a single crystal of aluminum oxide having a 14 deg half-wedge shaped portion. The tip of the half-wedge is rounded and has a thin-film sensor attached along the <b>stagnation</b> <b>line.</b> The bottom surface of the half-wedge is tilted upward to relieve shock induced disturbances created by the curved tip of the half-wedge.

40|$|Coupled ablator shock layer {{solutions}} for the stagnation point are presented for typical hyperbolic entry atmospheric flight conditions. These solutions were obtained by numerically solving the <b>stagnation</b> <b>line</b> shock layer equations and quasi-steady ablator equations. These equations included ablation and radiation coupling within the viscous shock layer, line and continuum radiation for both air and phenolic-nylon ablation species and local thermodynamic equilibrium throughout. The results presented provide a sound basis for understanding many of the processes characteristic of hypersonic shock layer heating. ...|$|E
40|$|A new {{numerical}} approach {{based on}} the Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) for {{the solution of the}} hydrodynamic performances of cambered hulls in steady planing is formulated and validated. Due to its fully 3 D formulation, the method can be applied to both cambered and un-cambered dihedral planing surfaces of any shape without any further approximation. The exact three-dimensional wetted surface of the hull is where the body boundary condition is fulfilled. The sprays region detaching both in front of the <b>stagnation</b> root <b>line</b> and from the wet portion of the chine are modeled in the numerical scheme by means of additional vortex lattice regions. The dynamic boundary condition at the stern of the hull is non-linear with respect to the perturbation potential. Results show the dynamic pressure consistently accounts for the 3 D features of the flow {{especially in the case of}} cambered planing surfaces. The numerical method is verified by a systematic analysis against semi-empirical methods and it is finally validated with experimental results on prismatic as well as cambered dihedral planing surfaces. Excellent correlations are found for both types of planing surfaces that range in the same confidence interval of higher fidelity numerical models, such as RANSE solvers...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} and state relationships of laminar soot-free (permanently blue) ethylene-fueled diffusion flames at various strain rates were studied both experimentally and computationally using an opposed-jet configuration. Measurements of gas velocities, temperatures, and compositions {{were carried out}} along the <b>stagnation</b> stream <b>line.</b> Corresponding predictions of flame structure were obtained, based on numerical simulations using several contemporary reaction mechanisms for methane oxidation. Flame conditions studied included ethylene-fueled opposed-jet diffusion flames having stoichiometric mixture fractions of 0. 7 with measurements involving strain rates of 60 - 240 /s and predictions involving strain rates of 0 - 1140 /s at normal temperature and pressure. It was found that measured major gas species concentrations and temperature distributions were in reasonably good agreement with predictions using mechanisms due to GRI-Mech and Peters and that effects of preferential diffusion significantly influence flame structure even when reactant mass diffusivities are similar. Oxygen leakage to fuel-rich conditions and carbon monoxide leakage to fuel-lean conditions both increased as strain rates increased. Furthermore, increased strain rates caused increased fuel concentrations near the flame sheet, decreased peak gas temperatures, and decreased concentrations {{of carbon dioxide and}} water vapor throughout the flames. State relationships for major gas species and gas temperatures were found to exist over a broad range of strain rates, providing potential for significant computational simplifications for modeling purposes in some instances...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of fine water droplets {{was investigated in}} a methane-air counterflow diffusion flame, specifically when the water droplets {{were added to the}} inlet air feed and used to extinguish the diffusion flame. The water droplets studied had a relatively broad size distribution (from 1 to 60 m), with the number mean diameter of 15 m and Sauter mean diameter of 25 m. With an increase in the velocity gradient, the flame approaches towards the stagnation plane and flame thickness decreases. The flame properties, such as flame location and flame thickness are insensitive to the water mass loading. Along the <b>stagnation</b> stream <b>line,</b> the velocity decreases towards a local minimum just before the flame front. In contrast, the velocity increases in the flame zone due to the thermal expansion, and then decreases towards the stagnation point. In the decelerating zone, the droplet mass flux decreases on approach to the flame zone due to a non-equilibrium in velocity of large droplets between liquid and gas phases. Furthermore, as the droplet-laden air approaches the flame front, the flow stream begins to diverge in the counterflow field. Since the small droplets move away from the burner axis, the divergence of the air flow acts to reduce the water droplet mass flux along the stagnation streamline. Large droplets moving faster than the air flow „catch up ‟ to slower ones just before the flame front, and the mass flux of the droplets tends to increase...|$|R
