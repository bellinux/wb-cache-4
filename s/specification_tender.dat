40|$|Innovative, {{low carbon}} {{technologies}} are already {{available for use}} in the construction of buildings, but the impact of their specification on construction projects is unclear. This exploratory research identifies issues which arise following the specification of BIPV in non-residential construction projects. Rather than treating the inclusion of a new technology as a technical problem, the research explores the issue from a socio-technical perspective to understand the accommodations which the project team makes and their effect on the building and the technology. The paper {{is part of a larger}} research project which uses a Social Construction of Technology Approach (SCOT) to explore the accommodations made to working practices and design when Building Integrated PhotoVoltaic (BIPV) technology is introduced. The approach explores how the requirements of the technology from different groups of actors (Relevant Social Groups or RSG's) give rise to problems and create solutions. As such it rejects the notion of a rational linear view of innovation diffusion; instead it suggests that the variety and composition of the Relevant Social Groups set the agenda for problem solving and solutions as the project progresses. The research explores the experiences of three people who have extensive histories of involvement with BIPV in construction, looks at how SCOT can inform our understanding of the issues involved and identifies themes and issues in the specification of BIPV on construction projects. A key finding concerns the alignment of inflection points at which interviewees have found themselves changing from one RSG to another as new problems and solutions are identified. The points at which they change RSG often occurred at points which mirror conventional construction categories (in terms of project <b>specification,</b> <b>tender,</b> design and construction) ...|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 63). Public Procurement always tries to achieve value for money and assure best service in right time through transparency, accountability and efficiency. Spending of public fund provided by Government or other Development partners are regulated by Public Procurement Act (PPA 2006), Public Procurement Regulation (PPR 2008) and Development partners specific procurement guideline. In a procurement cycle, there are many end to end steps. A step requires time to reach next step. The summation of time consumption for end to end steps is the total time of the procurement cycle. It is required to complete a procurement cycle from its inception to completion. It includes time required for identifying the need, preparing proper <b>specification,</b> <b>tendering</b> process, evaluation process, approval process, contract signing process, supply of goods by supplier and finally tests & received the goods as per specification by the purchaser. Through the process, Govt. organizations face some unexpected delays in receiving the goods in time. This {{study was conducted to}} identify the areas of delay for receiving goods in Directorate of Primary Education and to suggest recommendations for reducing the required time to ensure goods in right time.

40|$|When {{government}} entities procure {{goods or}} services, they generally consider and award contracts only to bidders who {{complied with the}} specifications and conditions of tender as laid down in the tender invitation. Tenders received must in other words be conforming, compliant or responsive. This enables procuring entities to compare tenders {{on an equal footing}} and ensures equal treatment amongst bidders. In South Africa the extent to which bidders must comply with <b>tender</b> <b>specifications</b> and conditions is a thorny issue in practice. In 2008 the Supreme Court of Appeal in Millennium Waste Management (Pty) Ltd v Chairperson, Tender Board: Limpopo Province confirmed the views of the courts in South Africa regarding compliance with tender conditions and the amendment of tenders before award. The recent 2013 decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal in Dr JS Moroka Municipality v The Chairperson of the Tender Evaluation Committee of the Dr JS Moroka Municipality, however, has moved public procurement regulation in South Africa to a point where procuring entities have very limited discretionary powers when evaluating compliance with <b>tender</b> <b>specifications</b> and conditions. This paper argues for an approach that allows procuring entities in South Africa more discretion when evaluating compliance with <b>tender</b> <b>specifications</b> and conditions. In doing so, reliance is placed on the treatment of "responsiveness" in international instruments as well as the views of the South African courts since first they were confronted with the issue. ...|$|R

40|$|Sri Lanka {{has made}} a {{significant}} development in the telecommunications sector {{since the inception of}} sector reforms in 1991, resulting in a competitive market environment. The results of liberalization have been impressive, with the telecommunications sector growing at one of the fastest paces in Asia. Along with above rapid growth of telecommunication industry, the numbers of antenna towers also have been increased from about 400 (in 1990) up to nearly 5100 towers during the last two decades. During the above boom period of development, some aspects of safety and reliability seem to have been overlooked. This report provides detailed discussion on the technical aspects of steel lattice antenna tower designs, codes of practice and different factors of safety. Postcollapse assessments of four incidences of recently collapsed tall antenna towers in Sri Lanka are also included in this report. Several shortcomings existing in currently available technical <b>specifications,</b> <b>tender</b> bidding processes and construction were also highlighted. The possible solutions and methods for eliminating above mentioned shortcomings are also discussed in detail. The void that exists in telecommunication industry due to the absence of properly qualified structural engineering experts are also highlighted. Further to that, the resulting negative effects such as neglecting public safety, lower reliability of telecommunication network, high possibility of accidents occurring, etc. are discussed in detail. The cost of construction vs safety of antenna towers is discussed with a desk study. Effectiveness of some common practices and beliefs which are influencing current antenna tower constructions are also discussed. Concluding remarks along with several basic recommendations are supplied for correcting the present mistakes while making more reliable telecommunication networks as well as ensuring public safety...|$|R
40|$|The design, {{construction}} and commissioning {{of a modern}} third-generation synchrotron light source facility is a major project, costing {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars. The delivery of these new facilities, usually on a fixed budget and schedule, requires an effective working relationship with all suppliers providing equipment and services to the project. This paper will examine some of the key issues in developing and maintaining such a relationship with industry during the construction of a third-generation synchrotron light facility. These issues include project planning, the contract <b>specification,</b> the <b>tendering</b> process, communication techniques over the contract term, and other aspects of contract control. Examples, primarily from our experience constructing the Canadian Light Source but also from other new facilities planned or under construction, will be used to examine the effectiveness of various approaches to working with industry...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a survey of}} the Government Land Sales (GLS) {{programme}} in Singapore as a mechanism through which design aspects of private developments are regulated by the state. By comparing <b>specifications</b> in <b>tender</b> documents with what was eventually built, and tracing how much design weighed in the awarding of tenders, the survey shows how design regulations moved from an experimental phase in the 1960 s when controls were sparse and discretionary, to being institutionalised by the 1980 s, when controls became comprehensive, precise, and technical. Still, this did not translate planning visions directly into reality, as developers and architects successfully made counterproposals during and after the tender process. By examining the Integrated Resort development at Marina Bay against shifts in political culture and economic conditions in the 1990 s, this paper concludes by arguing that the state deployed the GLS programme to procure ‘iconic’ buildings while excluding public involvement from actual design-review processes. ...|$|R

40|$|Short {{delivery}} times {{are considered a}} competitive advantage in the engineer-to-order (ETO) sector. Design-related tasks contribute to {{a substantial amount of}} {{delivery times}} and costs since ETO products have to be either fully developed or adapted to customer <b>specifications</b> within <b>tendering</b> or order fulfillment. Approaches aiming at a computerised automation of tasks related to the design process, often termed design automation or knowledge-based engineering, are generally regarded as an effective means to achieve lead time and cost reductions while maintaining, or even improving product quality. In this study we propose a maturity model as a framework for analyzing and improving such activities in ETO companies. We contribute to the literature in being the first to investigate design automation in the ETO sector from a maturity perspective. Beyond that, we extend the extant literature on design automation, which is of a highly technical nature, by providing a framework considering organizational and managerial aspects. The findings indicate that five different levels of maturity can be achieved across the dimensions strategies, processes, systems, and people. Empirical cases give insight into these different levels. Our investigation draws from extant literature and a comparative case study involving four companies over two years...|$|R

5000|$|Eriksson and Westerberg also {{reported}} that traditional procurement focused on competition is suitable for simple and standardised projects with low uncertainty. However, most projects are not like that. There is a trend towards increased complexity, uncertainty, and time pressure in projects, which has rendered traditional procurement procedures obsolete. Chen and Manley emphasized that projects focused on collaborative schemes, {{in which it is}} expected that relationships between project participants will be encouraged, can potentially maximize project outcomes. Cooperative procurement procedures entail among other things, joint <b>specification,</b> selected <b>tendering,</b> soft parameters in bid evaluation, joint subcontractor selection, incentive-based payment, collaborative tools, and contractor self-control. Collaborative approaches to project delivery are believed to be especially appropriate for projects of high complexity and uncertainty. Cardenas, Voordijk, and Dewulf have recently shown that some elements of the collaborative approach to procurement and delivery are beneficial in complex projects. The data on which this finding is originated consist of records on 58 European infrastructure projects. The records were obtained from a review of the pre- and post-contract transactions and were complemented with personalized semi-structured interviews held with the management of the projects.

40|$|Experience with {{existing}} multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) shows that trade measures agreed to within the MEAs themselves {{may not necessarily}} lead to a dispute between parties. On the contrary, {{there is a great}} chance that disputes may arise from national measures undertaken to fulfil those obligations under the MEAs. This possibility of conflict with their WTO obligations may well arise in implementing the Kyoto Protocol, given that Article 2 of the Protocol gives Annex 1 countries considerable flexibility in the choice of domestic policies to meet their greenhouse gas emissions commitments.
