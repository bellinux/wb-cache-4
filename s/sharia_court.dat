His grandfather had been a leading sheikh of the Qadariyya order and moved to Jableh from Iraq. Al-Qassam also followed the Hanafi fiqh (school of jurisprudence) of Sunni Islam and studied at the local Istambuli Mosque under the teaching of well-known ′alim (scholar) Sheikh Salim Tayarah.|$|E

There are also extra-Sharia government tribunals which handle disputes relating to specific royal decrees and since 2008, specialist courts, including the Board of Grievances and the Specialized Criminal Court. Final appeal from both Sharia courts and government tribunals is to the King and , all courts and tribunals followed Sharia rules of evidence and procedure.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 he was {{appointed}} the marriage registrar at the <b>sharia</b> <b>court</b> in Haifa by the Waqf authorities in Jerusalem, a role {{that allowed him to}} tour the northern villages, whose inhabitants he encouraged to set up agricultural cooperatives. According to the American historian Edmund Burke, al-Qassam was:An individual deeply imbued with the Islamic social gospel and who was struck by the plight of Palestinian peasants and migrants. Al-Qassam's pastoral concern was linked to his moral outrage as a Muslim at {{the ways in which the}} old implicit social compact was being violated in the circumstances of British mandatory Palestine. This anger fueled a political radicalism that drove him eventually to take up arms and marks him off from the Palestinian notable politicians.|$|E

50|$|The {{constitution}} is self-contradictory on the judiciary, {{on the one}} hand providing for its independence {{and on the other hand}} limiting that independence. Malaysia's constitution provides for a dual justice system, under which secular law and sharia (syariah) law are both recognised, and secular criminal and civil <b>courts</b> coexist with <b>sharia</b> <b>courts.</b> <b>Sharia</b> law applies only to, and <b>sharia</b> <b>courts</b> have jurisdiction over, only Muslims. In some states <b>sharia</b> <b>courts</b> solely or principally adjudicate family and personal law, while in other states they are empowered to pass judgment on criminal matters.|$|R
40|$|The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia Constitution (FDRE constitution) {{has taken}} a bold step in {{recognizing}} and promoting ethno-linguistic and religious divert in the country. To this effect, it has specifically granted mandate to customary and religious system in settlement of disputes on matters affecting personal status of individuals. The legal pluralism recognized by the constitution gives rise to plurality of sources of normative ordering that could potentially conflict with state laws, and especially with the supremacy clause of the constitution and human rights provisions enshrined under the constitution. This {{is the case with}} matters falling within the competence of <b>sharia</b> <b>courts</b> that are to be resolved by the application of Islamic law, which has a different conception and approach towards the rights of women in general and gender equality in divorce, inheritance, sharing of estate upon divorce, etc. The decisions rendered by <b>sharia</b> <b>courts</b> using Islamic rules could conflict with rules human rights norms in general and rules on gender equality, protection of against discrimination on any ground, etc that are enunciated under the Constitution. This paper examines mechanisms, if any, adopted by the FDRE Constitution to manage the potential clash between state laws {{on the one hand and}} religious laws and decisions on the other as related to the jurisdiction of <b>sharia</b> <b>courts.</b> Whether or not final judgments pronounced by <b>sharia</b> <b>courts</b> are supposed to be compatible with the constitutional standards (such as the supremacy clause and human rights provisions) are examined. Before doing so, some important issues that serve as a framework to put things in context that are related to <b>sharia</b> <b>courts</b> such as their brief history in the country, their jurisdiction,, structure, administration, and place in the legal system will be discussed. In addition, few cases decided by <b>sharia</b> <b>courts</b> that shed light on practice of exercising their jurisdiction and relationships with courts of law and an organ in charge with the task of interpreting the Constitution are reviewed. The discussions on issues raised in the paper are based on the analysis of the relevant provisions of the FDRE constitution and laws related to the jurisdiction of <b>sharia</b> <b>courts,</b> such as the <b>Sharia</b> <b>Courts</b> Establishment Proclamation, the Civil Code, the Federal Courts Establishment Proclamation, etc, and review of few cases decided on by <b>sharia</b> <b>courts</b> along with consultation of relevant literature. <b>Sharia</b> <b>courts</b> are set up both the Federal and each nine units of the Ethiopian federation and the focus here is on the Federal <b>sharia</b> <b>courts</b> and not the Regional ones...|$|R
5|$|In 1945 Deir al-Balah had a {{population}} of 2,560, all Arabs, with 14,735 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 327 dunams were for citrus and bananas, 472 plantations and irrigable land, 14,438 used for cereals, while 39 dunams were built-up land. In the lead-up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, residents of Deir al-Balah participated in a local attack against the nearby kibbutz of Kfar Darom, despite being discouraged by Egyptian Army officers, but they were repelled and suffered casualties. During the war, Egypt captured the town along with other towns {{in an area that}} became known as the Gaza Strip. The Egyptians later established a <b>sharia</b> <b>court</b> system that held jurisdiction over personal affairs. Egyptian rule introduced relative prosperity to Deir al-Balah. The town witnessed a booming citrus industry made possible by the discovery of a substantial reservoir of ground water in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of centralized government, much {{of the legal system}} and most of the educational institutions and social services fell under the control of religious institutions, which often received significant funding and support from international charities. In 2005, some of these clerical organizations united to form the Islamic Courts Union, after the secular rebel leaders began to challenge the sharia-based judicial institutions. Wary of Islamist paramilitaries {{in the age of the}} War on Terror, the CIA funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to secular rebel leaders inside Somalia in 2006, intending thereby to neutralize the threat of suspected members of Al Qaeda they believed to be sheltered by the ICU. This was cited by experts as a factor in the resurgence of Islamic militias in the country, prompting the latter to engage in pre-emptive strikes which routed the rebel leaders and led to the seizure of Ford by the ICU. The ICU gained control of Mogadishu and its surrounding districts in June 2006, after the Second Battle of Mogadishu. The ICU was later overthrown by the Ethiopian military with the support of the United Nations, African Union, and the United States government. After the ICU forces were chased from Mogadishu, the leaders of the Transitional Federal Parliament entered Somalia declaring themselves the rightful governors of Somalia. As of October 2007, there was still widespread opposition within Somalia to the TFG, and the TFG's leaders and their allies were still attempting to suppress a strong insurgency. In January 2009 politician Abdirahman Ahmed was executed for alleged apostasy by a <b>Sharia</b> <b>court.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{rules of}} {{evidence}} in sharia courts also maintain a distinctive custom of prioritizing oral testimony. Witnesses, in a <b>sharia</b> <b>court</b> system, must be faithful, that is Muslim. Male Muslim witnesses are deemed more reliable than female Muslim witnesses, and non-Muslim witnesses considered unreliable and receive no priority in a <b>sharia</b> <b>court.</b> In civil cases in some countries, a Muslim woman witness is considered half the worth and reliability than a Muslim man witness. In criminal cases, women witnesses are unacceptable in stricter, traditional interpretations of sharia, such as those found in Hanbali madhhab.|$|E

50|$|Libya {{maintained}} a dual system of courts during this period: sharia law, of the Maliki school, was applied by <b>sharia</b> <b>courts</b> {{in matters of}} personal status. However, the establishment of this system of dual courts in practise meant power was taken away from the traditional <b>sharia</b> <b>courts,</b> leading to a backlash {{and the growth of}} Islamic opposition movements.|$|R
25|$|National laws of Malaysia require Muslim apostates {{who seek}} to convert from Islam to another {{religion}} to first obtain approval from a <b>sharia</b> <b>court.</b> The procedure demands that anyone born to a Muslim parent, or who previously converted to Islam, must declare himself apostate of Islam before a <b>Sharia</b> <b>court</b> {{if he or she}} wants to convert. The Sharia courts have the power to impose penalties such as jail, caning and enforced “rehabilitation” on apostates – which is the typical practice. In the states of Perak, Malacca, Sabah, and Pahang, apostates of Islam face jail term; in Pahang, caning; others, confinement with rehabilitation process.|$|E

25|$|Malaysia's {{legal system}} {{is based on}} English Common Law, {{alongside}} a <b>Sharia</b> <b>court</b> system for Malaysian Muslims.

Peninsular Malaysia and the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak each has a high court.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the judge}} is {{empowered}} to disregard previous judgments (either his own or of other judges) and may apply his personal interpretation of Sharia to any particular case, divergent judgements arise even in apparently identical cases, making predictability of legal interpretation difficult. The <b>Sharia</b> <b>court</b> system constitutes the basic judiciary of Saudi Arabia and its judges (qadi) and lawyers form part of the ulema, the country's Islamic scholars.|$|E
25|$|Marriage is solemnized as {{a written}} {{financial}} contract, {{in the presence}} of two Muslim male witnesses, and it includes a brideprice (Mahr) payable from a Muslim man to a Muslim woman.

Written contracts are paramount in sharia courts in the matters of dispute that are debt-related, which includes marriage contracts. Written contracts in debt-related cases, when notarized by a judge, is deemed more reliable.|$|E

Such laws have been criticized by Human Rights Watch and Equality Now as being discriminatory towards women.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sharia</b> <b>courts</b> in the UAE have a {{significant}} amount of authority. Flogging is a punishment for criminal offences such as adultery, premarital sex and alcohol consumption. Due to <b>Sharia</b> <b>courts,</b> flogging is legal with sentences ranging from 80 to 200 lashes. Between 2007 and 2013, many people in the UAE were sentenced to 100 lashes. In Abu Dhabi, people have been sentenced to 80 lashes for kissing in public. Several Muslims in Abu Dhabi and Ajman were sentenced to 80 lashes for alcohol consumption. An Estonian soldier in 2006 was sentenced to 40 lashes for being drunk. Several people have been sentenced to 60 lashes for illicit sex. <b>Sharia</b> <b>courts</b> have penalized domestic workers with floggings. Under UAE law, premarital sex is punishable by 100 lashes.|$|R

The ambassador informed the <b>Sharia</b> <b>court</b> {{that he had been}} deliberately deceived by the bride's mother, who had shown him photographs of the bride's sister. He only discovered this when he lifted the niqab to kiss his bride. The court annulled the marriage, but refused a claim for compensation.|$|E

25|$|Although Malaysia is a multi-religious society, and the Malaysian {{constitution}} theoretically guarantees {{freedom of}} religion, Islam {{is the official}} religion of the federation, {{as well as the}} legally-presumed faith of all ethnic Malays. No ethnic Malay is allowed to leave Islam, while non-Malay Muslims seeking to apostacise require permission from a <b>sharia</b> <b>court,</b> which is rarely granted. Religious beliefs follow ethnic lines. Holidays have been declared for holy days in numerous religions, although only Islam has more than one national holiday. Whether a religion obtains approval of the government is determined by the Registrar of Societies, part of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Only upon approval do they qualify for government benefits. However, unrecognised groups such as the Falun Gong can practise by registering themselves under the Companies Act, although this means that technical violations of the act can result in a fine.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{historical}} debate regarding Muhammad Ali reflects the simultaneous political struggles which occurred in Egypt during the 20th century. Fuad I of Egypt in the 1930s sponsored the collection, arrangement, and translation of the available historical documents relating to his predecessors, which became the Royal Archives of Egypt. These Royal Archives represented the primary and, {{in the case of}} some important works, the only source of information for Egyptian history until the <b>sharia</b> <b>court</b> records became available in the 1970s. Fuad's portrayal of Muhammad Ali as a nationalist and benevolent monarch therefore heavily influenced {{the historical}} debate. Later, Nasser and his revolutionary republican regime promoted an alternative narrative which portrayed Muhammad Ali as the nationalist founder of modern Egypt but also an ambitious monarch with little regard for his people whose policies ultimately benefited himself and his dynasty at the expense of Egypt.|$|E
25|$|In Islam, {{marriage}} is a contract between {{the bride and groom}} (or their proxies) known as a nikah. Some Islamic couples only go through a nikah ceremony and do not register the marriage with the civil authorities or go through a civil ceremony. When such a relationship breaks down, the wife is left without state protection that would normally be available if the marriage had been registered according to civil law. The situation is exacerbated if the husband refuses to grant a talaq and also refuses to make any provision. In states where there is no <b>Sharia</b> <b>Court,</b> the affected individuals' only recourse would be to the local civil courts, but jurisdiction would be difficult to invoke except under the parens patriae provisions to protect the best interests of any children. As to transnational marriages, there is no reason in principle why religious ceremonies effective under the lex loci celebrationis should not create marriages recognized as valid everywhere.|$|E

40|$|Courts of law play an {{important}} role in actualizing the need for justice. A host of problems and challenges to meet justice means that no single state institution or process can shoulder the quest for justice alone, both substantive and procedural, and safeguard rights, privileges, entitlements, and expectation of both the individuals and the public. Litigation is only one of the options amongst the available routes for seeking justice. Thus, the search for justice and ways to resolve disputes outside the formal justice system is a universal phenomenon (ICHRP, 2009 : 43). This is especially more evident in multicultural societies where there are different sources of norms. Settlement of disputes can be realized through alternative dispute resolution schemes or mechanisms based on customary or religious systems. Many studies suggest that non-formal systems handle a very large share of cases, especially in developing countries (ICHRP, 2009 : 43). This is ascribed, among others, to the fact that they have an inherent nature that appeal to the would-be parties that rely on them (cultural and physical proximity, expediency, and procedures that suit the need of the users, making them closer to the users than the formal state institutions). The state needs to adopt policies to reckon with such system. The state’s approach to non- state dispute settlement means varies and ranges from a degree of tolerance to suppression. In Ethiopia, <b>sharia</b> <b>courts</b> have been in operation for long, although their de jure recognition materialized in early 1940 s, which was cast into doubt in 1960 s and revived in 1990 s. In this chapter, attempt will be made to discuss about <b>sharia</b> <b>courts</b> and their role in the settlement of disputes involving the concern of Muslims. Background information on Islam and <b>sharia</b> <b>courts</b> is offered before delving into details regarding the jurisdiction, administration and interaction of <b>sharia</b> <b>courts</b> with formal state justice system. Finally, the practice of some <b>sharia</b> <b>courts</b> (that of the Federal, Afar and Oromiya) and challenges facing them are reviewed. Discussion in this chapter is based on the relevant literature and interview with some personnel of <b>sharia</b> <b>courts,</b> especially judges thereto. The interview is used for the purpose of highlighting the practice of <b>sharia</b> <b>courts</b> in the settlement of disputes and to identify challenges they encounter. It is suggested that <b>Sharia</b> <b>Courts</b> play {{an important}} role in addressing the concern of Muslims to have family and personal issues controlled and resolved by Islamic law, and in relieving the burden of regular courts...|$|R
