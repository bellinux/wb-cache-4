The {{head and neck}} are bald, with the <b>skin</b> <b>color</b> varying, including yellow, orange, blue, purple, and red. The king vulture has a very noticeable orange fleshy caruncle on its beak. This vulture is a scavenger and it often makes the initial cut into a fresh carcass. It also displaces smaller New World vulture species from a carcass.

5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Nine is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} primarily {{set in a}} cyberspace version of 1990s Tokyo, with players {{taking control of the}} silent main protagonist to explore various environments within Tokyo's districts, along with switching between different districts with a dedicated fast-travel menu. The player can adjust the protagonist's name, gender, hair and <b>skin</b> <b>color.</b> Navigation through environments is presented through a third-person perspective, with the player character being followed by one assigned demon. While navigating safe areas, players can enter shops to buy new equipment and items such as healing potions, and change their character's clothing and hairstyle.|$|E

5|$|The {{skin of a}} larva is mottled with black, brown, {{and yellow}} pigmentation. <b>Skin</b> <b>color</b> changes as the larvae develop and pigment cells migrate and {{concentrate}} in {{different regions of the}} body. The pigment cells, called chromatophores, are derived from the neural crest. The three types of pigment chromatophores in salamanders include yellow xanthophores, black melanophores, and silvery iridiophores (or guanophores). As the larvae mature, the melanophores concentrate along the body and provide the darker background. The yellow xanthophores arrange along the spine and on top of the limbs. The rest of the body is flecked with reflective iridiophores along the sides and underneath.|$|E
5|$|In Batesian mimicry, a palatable, {{harmless}} prey species {{mimics the}} appearance of another species that is noxious to predators, thus reducing the mimic's risk of attack. This form of mimicry is seen in many insects. The idea behind Batesian mimicry is that predators that have tried to eat the unpalatable species learn to associate its colors and markings with an unpleasant taste. This results in the predator learning to avoid species displaying similar colors and markings, including Batesian mimics. Some species of octopus can mimic a selection of other animals by changing their <b>skin</b> <b>color,</b> skin pattern and body motion. When a damselfish attacks an octopus, the octopus mimics a banded sea-snake. The model chosen varies with the octopus's predator and habitat. Most of these octopuses use Batesian mimicry, selecting an organism repulsive to predators as a model.|$|E
5|$|Pitman was a hapa-haole, of part Hawaiian {{and part}} Caucasian descent. His father {{was white and}} his {{native-born}} mother was also part Caucasian from her own mother, who {{was the daughter of}} Captain Cox and a Hawaiian chiefess. Despite his mixed-race ancestry, Pitman avoided the racial segregation imposed on other Native Hawaiian volunteers in this period. Most Native Hawaiians who participated in the war were assigned to colored regiments, but Pitman's fair <b>skin</b> <b>color</b> meant he was able to serve in a white unit, indicating that unit assignment may have been influenced by how dark Hawaiians appeared. Historians Bob Dye, James L. Haley and others claimed Pitman was placed in the colored regiments because of his mixed race, but regiment records indicate otherwise.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{selection}} {{may have}} played a role in the diversification of <b>skin</b> <b>color</b> and pattern in poison frogs. With female preferences in play, male coloration could evolve rapidly. Sexual selection is influenced by many things. The parental investment may shed some light on the evolution of coloration in relation to female choice. In Oophaga pumilio, the female provides care for the offspring for several weeks whereas the males provides care for a few days, implying a strong female preference. Sexual selection increases phenotypic variation drastically. In populations of O. pumilio that participated in sexual selection, the phenotypic polymorphism was evident. The lack of sexual dimorphism in some dendrobatid populations however suggests that sexual selection is not a valid explanation.|$|E
25|$|The actual <b>skin</b> <b>color</b> of {{different}} humans {{is affected by}} many substances, although {{the single most important}} substance determining human <b>skin</b> <b>color</b> is the pigment melanin. Melanin is produced within the skin in cells called melanocytes and it is the main determinant of the <b>skin</b> <b>color</b> of darker-skinned humans. The <b>skin</b> <b>color</b> of people with light skin is determined mainly by the bluish-white connective tissue under the dermis and by the hemoglobin circulating in the veins of the dermis. The red color underlying the skin becomes more visible, especially in the face, when, as consequence of physical exercise or the stimulation of the nervous system (anger, fear), arterioles dilate.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 10% of the {{variance}} in <b>skin</b> <b>color</b> occurs within regions, and approximately 90% occurs between regions. Because <b>skin</b> <b>color</b> has been under strong selective pressure, similar skin colors can result from convergent adaptation rather than from genetic relatedness; populations with similar pigmentation may be genetically no more similar than other widely separated groups. Furthermore, {{in some parts of the}} world where people from different regions have mixed extensively, the connection between <b>skin</b> <b>color</b> and ancestry has substantially weakened. In Brazil, for example, <b>skin</b> <b>color</b> is not closely associated with the percentage of recent African ancestors a person has, as estimated from an analysis of genetic variants differing in frequency among continent groups.|$|E

25|$|Writers in {{the medieval}} Middle East also {{produced}} theories of environmental determinism.

25|$|The {{understanding}} of the genetic mechanisms underlying human <b>skin</b> <b>color</b> variation is still incomplete, however genetic studies have discovered a number of genes that affect human <b>skin</b> <b>color</b> in specific populations, and have shown that this happens independently of other physical features such as eye and hair color. Different populations have different allele frequencies of these genes, {{and it is the}} combination of these allele variations that bring about the complex, continuous variation in skin coloration we can observe today in modern humans. Population and admixture studies suggest a 3-way model for the evolution of human <b>skin</b> <b>color,</b> with dark skin evolving in early hominids in sub-Saharan Africa and light skin evolving independently in Europe and East Asia after modern humans had expanded out of Africa.|$|E
