40|$|Homothallic {{strains of}} Saccharomyes cerevisiae {{are able to}} switch {{efficiently}} from one mating genotype to another. From a single haploid spore arise both a and α mating type cells, which then self-mate to produce a colony consisting almost exclusively of nonmating a/α diploid cells. We have isolated a mutant homothallic strain that gives rise to colonies that show bisexual mating behavior. The mating reaction is always asymmetric, that is, in some colonies a mating is much stronger than α mating, while others show greater α than a mating. —This mating phenotype arises from the presence of three cell types in a colony: some a/α nonmating diploids and an unequal number of a and α haploid cells. The predominant haploid type {{is that of the}} original cell that gives rise to the colony. This mixture of cell types arises from a very reduced efficiency of homothallic mating-type interconversions in the mutant strain. —The mutation, designated switch (swi 1 – 1), behaves as a single genetic locus. The mutation is centromere linked, but not linked to the mating type locus or to any of the homothallism genes: HO, HMa and HMα. The <b>switch</b> <b>mutation</b> does not affect the efficiency of self-mating, but rather directly affects the frequency of interconversion of mating types...|$|E

RELA knockout mice is embryonic lethal due to liver apoptosis. Lymphocyte activation failure is also observed, suggesting that RELA is indispensable in the proper development of the immune system. In comparison, deletion of other REL-related genes will not cause embryonic development failure, though different levels of defects are also noted. The fact that cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1 can stimulate the activation of RELA also supports its participation in immune response. In general, RELA participates in adaptive immunity and responses to invading pathogens via NF-κB activation. Mice without individual NF-κB proteins are deficient in B- and T-cell activation and proliferation, cytoline production and isotype <b>switching.</b> <b>Mutations</b> in RELA is found responsible for inflammatory bowel disease as well.|$|R

A conserved glutamic residue in the alpha subunit of G proteins has been hypothesized to serve as a general base, thereby activating a water molecule for nucleophilic attack on GTP. The results of mutagenesis of this residue (Glu- 207) in Gi alpha 1 refute this hypothesis. Based on the structure of the complex of Gi alpha 1 with GDP, Mg 2 +, and AlF- 4, which appears to resemble the transition state for GTP hydrolysis, we believe that Gln- 204 of Gi alpha 1, rather than Glu- 207, supports catalysis of GTP hydrolysis by stabilization of the transition state...|$|R

Analysis of metabolite concentrations during the transition revealed that the Csr system has a major effect on the energy levels of the cells after glucose exhaustion.

To examine the function of the switch complex, we isolated from 10 cheY mutants 500 pseudorevertants with a suppressor mutation in one of the three genes (fliG, fliM, and fliN) encoding the switch complex. Detailed mapping revealed that these suppressor mutations were localized to several segments of each switch gene, suggesting localization of functional sites on the switch complex. These <b>switch</b> <b>mutations</b> were introduced into the wild-type background and into a chemotaxis deletion background. Behavior of the pseudorevertants and their derivatives (1, 500 strains in all) was observed by light microscopy. In the chemotaxis deletion background, about 70 % of the switch mutants showed smooth swimming and the rest showed more or less tumbly swimming. There was some correlation between the mutational sites and the swimming patterns in the chemotaxis deletion background, suggesting that there is segregation of functional sites on the switch complex. The interaction of the switch complex with the chemotaxis protein, CheY, and the stochastic nature of switching in the absence of CheY are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Cotranscriptional R-loops {{are formed}} in yeast mutants of the THO complex, which {{functions}} at {{the interface between}} transcription and mRNA export. Despite the relevance of R-loops in transcription-associated recom-bination, the mechanisms by which they trigger recombination are still elusive. In order to understand how R-loops compromise genome stability, we have analyzed the genetic interaction of THO with 26 genes involved in replication, S-phase checkpoint, DNA repair, and chromatin remodeling. We found a synthetic growth defect in double null mutants of THO and S-phase checkpoint factors, such as the replication factor C- and PCNA-like complexes. Under replicative stress, R-loop-forming THO null mutants require functional S-phase checkpoint functions but not double-strand-break repair functions for survival. Furthermore, R-loop-forming hpr 1 mutants display replication fork progression impairment at actively transcribed chromosomal regions and trigger Rad 53 phosphorylation. We conclude that R-loop-mediated DNA damage activates the S-phase checkpoint, which {{is required for the}} cell survival of THO mutants under replicative stress. In light of these results, we propose a model in which R-loop-mediated recombination is explained by template <b>switching.</b> <b>Mutation</b> and recombination are increased by transcription in bacteria, yeasts, and humans, phenomena referred to as transcription-associated mutation (TAM) and transcription...|$|R
40|$|The swi 8 (+) gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe {{appears to}} be {{involved}} in the termination step of copy synthesis during mating-type (MT) <b>switching.</b> <b>Mutations</b> in swi 8 confer a general mutator phenotype and, in particular, generate specific mutations in the MT region. Sequencing of the MT cassettes of the h(90) swi 8 - 137 mutant revealed three altered sites. One is situated at the switching (smt) signal adjacent to the H 1 homology box of the expression locus mat 1 : 1. It reduces the rate of MT switching. The alteration at the smt signal arose frequently in other h(90) swi 8 strains and is probably caused by gene conversion in which the sequence adjacent to the H 1 box of mat 2 : 2 is used as template. This change might be generated during the process of MT switching when hybrid DNA formation is anomalously extended into the more heterologous region flanking the H 1 homology box. In addition to the gene conversion at mat 1 : 1, two mutations were found in the H 3 homology boxes of the silent cassettes mat 2 : 2 and mat 3 : 3...|$|R
40|$|Phase {{variation}} of type 1 fimbriation in Escherichia coli {{is associated with}} the site-specific recombination of a 314 -bp DNA invertible element. The fim switch directs transcription of fimA, the major fimbrial subunit gene, in one orientation (on) but not the other (off). Switching requires either fimB (on-to-off or off-to-on inversion) or fimE (on-to-off inversion only) and is reduced sharply in strains containing lrp::Tn 10 <b>mutations.</b> Both fimE-promoted <b>switching</b> and fimB-promoted switching are stimulated by the amino acids alanine, isoleucine, leucine, and valine, and this regulation requires lrp. Here it is shown that the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) binds in and adjacent to the fim <b>switch.</b> <b>Mutations</b> in fim that lower Lrp binding in vitro have corresponding effects on both fimB-promoted switching and fimE-promoted switching in vivo. Lrp initiates binding at one of two sites within the fim switch. Additional cooperative binding results in an extensive region of protection from both DNase I and 1, 10 -phenanthroline-copper complex-activated DNA cleavage. The region of protection can extend to within 12 bp of the right inverted repeat (switch off) and occupies over one-third of the switch. It is proposed that wrapping of fim DNA around an Lrp complex is required to form a recombination-proficient structure...|$|R

Here, we use hydroxyl radical cleavage pattern as a measure of local DNA structure. We compared the conservation between DNA sequence and structure in terms of information content and attempted to assess the functional implications of DNA structures in regulatory motifs. We used statistical methods to evaluate the structural divergence of substituting a single position within a binding site and applied them to a collection of putative regulatory motifs. The following are our major observations: (i) we observed more information in structural alignment than in the corresponding sequence alignment for most of the transcriptional factors; (ii) for each TF, majority of positions have more information in the structural alignment as compared to the sequence alignment; (iii) we further defined a DNA structural divergence score (SD score) for each wild-type and mutant pair that is distinguished by single-base mutation. The SD score for benign mutations is significantly lower than that of <b>switch</b> <b>mutations.</b> This indicates structural conservation is also important for TFBS to be functional and DNA structures will provide previously unappreciated information for TF to realize the binding specificity...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{introduce}} a computationally-driven enzyme redesign workflow for altering cofactor specificity from NADPH to NADH. By compiling and comparing data from previous studies involving cofactor <b>switching</b> <b>mutations,</b> we show that their effect cannot be explained as straightforward changes in volume, hydrophobicity, charge, or BLOSUM 62 scores of the residues populating the cofactor binding site. Instead, {{we find that the}} use of a detailed cofactor binding energy approximation is needed to adequately capture the relative affinity towards different cofactors. The implicit solvation models Generalized Born with molecular volume integration and Generalized Born with simple switching were integrated in the iterative protein redesign and optimization (IPRO) framework to drive the redesign of Candida boidinii xylose reductase (CbXR) to function using the non-native cofactor NADH. We identified 10 variants, out of the 8, 000 possible combinations of mutations, that improve the computationally assessed binding affinity for NADH by introducing mutations in the CbXR binding pocket. Experimental testing revealed that seven out of ten possessed significant xylose reductase activity utilizing NADH, with the best experimental design (CbXR-GGD) being 27 -fold more active on NADH. The NADPH-dependent activity for eight out of ten predicted designs was either completely abolished or significantly diminished by at least 90 %, yielding a greater than 104 -fold change in specificity to NADH (CbXR-REG).

GTP hydrolysis causes conformational changes in three regions of Gα, including Switch I and <b>Switch</b> II. <b>Mutation</b> of G 202 →A in Switch II of Gαi 1 accelerates the rates of both GTP hydrolysis and conformational change, which {{is measured by the}} loss of fluorescence from Trp- 211 in <b>Switch</b> II. <b>Mutation</b> of K 180 →P in Switch I increases the rate of conformational change but decreases the GTPase rate, which causes transient but substantial accumulation of a low-fluorescence Gαi 1 ·GTP species. Isothermal titration calorimetric analysis of the binding of (G 202 A) Gαi 1 and (K 180 P) Gαi 1 to the GTPase-activating protein RGS 4 indicates that the G 202 A mutation stabilizes the pretransition state-like conformation of Gαi 1 that is mimicked by the complex of Gαi 1 with GDP and magnesium fluoroaluminate, whereas the K 180 P mutation destabilizes this state. The crystal structures of (K 180 P) Gαi 1 bound to a slowly hydrolyzable GTP analog, and the GDP·magnesium fluoroaluminate complex provide evidence that the Mg 2 + binding site is destabilized and that Switch I is torsionally restrained by the K 180 P mutation. The data are consistent with a catalytic mechanism for Gα in which major conformational transitions in Switch I and Switch II are obligate events that precede the bond-breaking step in GTP hydrolysis. In (K 180 P) Gαi 1, the two events are decoupled kinetically, whereas in the native protein they are concerted...|$|R

Vaccination against potential pandemic strains is one strategy in planning for future influenza pandemics; however {{the success of}} live attenuated vaccines for H 5 N 1 has been limited, due to poor replication in the human upper respiratory tract (URT). Mutations that increase the ability of H 5 N 1 viruses to replicate in the URT will aid immunogenicity of these vaccines and provide information about humanising adaptations in H 5 N 1 strains that may signal transmissibility. As well as mediating receptor interactions, the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of influenza facilitates fusion of the viral membrane and genome entry into the host cell, this process is pH dependent.

Interphase MPF is inhibited through phosphorylation of Cdk 1 by Wee 1 -related kinases. Because Cdc 25 phosphatases remove this phosphate, Cdc 25 activity {{is an essential part}} of the switch that drives cells into mitosis. The generation of a critical “trigger” of active MPF promotes a positive feedback loop that employs Polo kinase to boost Cdc 25 activity and inhibit Wee 1, thereby ensuring that mitotic commitment is a bistable <b>switch.</b> <b>Mutations</b> in the spindle pole body (SPB) component Cut 12 suppress otherwise lethal deficiencies in Cdc 25. ResultsCut 12 harbors a bipartite protein phosphatase 1 (PP 1) docking domain. Mutation of either element alone suppressed the temperature-dependent lethality of cdc 25. 22, whereas simultaneous ablation of both allowed cells to divide in the complete absence of Cdc 25. Late G 2 phase phosphorylation between the two elements by MPF and the NIMA kinase Fin 1 blocked PP 1 Dis 2 recruitment, thereby promoting recruitment of Polo to Cut 12 and the SPB and elevating global Polo kinase activity throughout the cell. ConclusionsPP 1 recruitment to Cut 12 sets a threshold for Polo’s feedback-loop activity that locks the cell in interphase until Cdc 25 pushes MPF activity through this barrier to initiate mitosis. We propose that events on the SPB (and, by inference, the centrosome) integrate inputs from diverse signaling networks to generate a coherent decision to divide that is appropriate for the particular environmental context of each cell.

Mutation in glycogen metabolism was also demonstrated to hinder metabolic adaptation after glucose exhaustion because of insufficient energy. This work explains how the Csr system influences E. coli fitness during the glycolysis-gluconeogenesis switch and demonstrates the role of glycogen in maintenance of the energy charge during metabolic adaptation. IMPORTANCE Glycogen is a polysaccharide and the main storage form of glucose from bacteria such as Escherichia coli to yeasts and mammals. Although its function as a sugar reserve in mammals is well documented, the role of glycogen in bacteria is not as clear. By studying the role of posttranscriptional regulation during metabolic adaptation, for the first time, we demonstrate the role of sugar reserve played by glycogen in E. coli. Indeed, glycogen not only makes it possible to maintain sufficient energy during metabolic transitions but is also the key component in the capacity of cells to resume growth. Since the essential posttranscriptional regulatory system Csr is a major regulator of glycogen accumulation, this work also sheds light on the central role of posttranscriptional regulation in metabolic adaptation...|$|R

40|$|Understanding how protein sequence, {{structure}} and function coevolve {{is at the core}} of functional genome annotation and protein engineering. The fundamental problem is to determine whether sequence variation contributes to functional differences or if it is a consequence of evolutionary divergence that is unrelated to functional specificity. To address this problem, we cannot merely analyze sequence variation between homologous proteins that have different functions. For comparison, we need to understand the factors that determine sequence variation in proteins that have the same function, such as a set of orthologous enzymes. Here, we address this problem by analyzing the evolution of functionally important residues in the o-succinylbenzoate synthase (OSBS) family. The OSBS family consists of several hundred enzymes that catalyze a step in menaquinone (Vit. K 2) synthesis. Based on phylogeny, the OSBS family can be divided into eight major subfamilies. We assayed wild-type OSBS enzyme activities. The results show that the enzymes from ?-Proteobacteria subfamily 1 and Bacteroidetes have relatively low values, the enzyme from Cyanobacteria subfamily 1 is intermediate, and the values for the proteins from the Actinobacteria and Firmicutes subfamilies are relatively high. We are using computational and experimental methods to identify functionally important amino acids in each subfamily. Our data suggest that each subfamily has a different set of functionally important residues, even though the enzymes catalyze the same reaction. These differences may have accumulated because different mutations were required in each subfamily to compensate for deleterious mutations or to adapt to changing environments. We assessed the roles of these amino acids in enzyme {{structure and}} function. Our method achieved 70 % successful rate to identify positions that play important roles in one family but not another.

Consistently, we found that mutation of this Gly in the Switch II element of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 B (eIF 5 B) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae impaired cell growth and the guanine nucleotide-binding, GTPase, and ribosomal subunit joining activities of eIF 5 B. In a screen for mutations that bypassed the critical requirement for this Switch II Gly in eIF 5 B, intragenic suppressors were identified in the Switch I element and at a residue in domain II of eIF 5 B that interacts with Switch II.

A survey of single amino acid substitutions near the polymerase active site or deoxynucleoside triphosphate-binding site of HIV- 1 RT indicated that several substitutions increased the rate of RT template <b>switching.</b> Several <b>mutations</b> associated with resistance to antiviral nucleoside analogs (K 65 R, L 74 V, E 89 G, Q 151 N, and M 184 I) dramatically increased RT template-switching frequencies by two- to sixfold in a single replication cycle. In contrast, substitutions in the RNase H domain (H 539 N, D 549 N) decreased the frequency of RT template switching by twofold. Depletion of intracellular nucleotide pools by hydroxyurea treatment of cells used as targets for infection resulted in a 1. 8 -fold increase {{in the frequency of}} RT template switching. These results indicate that the dynamic steady state between polymerase and RNase H activities is an important determinant of HIV- 1 RT template switching and establish that HIV- 1 recombination occurs by the previously described dynamic copy choice mechanism. These results also indicate that mutations conferrin...|$|R
40|$|Somatic {{hypermutation}} {{and class}} switch recombination (CSR) {{contribute to the}} somatic diversification of antibodies. It {{has been shown that}} MutS homologue (Msh) 6 (in conjunction with Msh 2) but not Msh 3 is involved in generating A/T base substitutions in somatic hypermutation. However, their roles in CSR have not yet been reported. Here we show that Msh 6 �/� mice have a decrease in CSR, whereas Msh 3 �/ � mice do not. When switch regions were analyzed for mutations, deficiency in Msh 6 was associated with an increase in transition mutations at G/C basepairs, mutations at RGYW/WRCY hotspots, and a small increase in the targeting of G/C bases. In addition, Msh 6 �/ � mice exhibited an increase in the targeting of recombination sites to GAGCT/GGGGT consensus repeats and hotspots in S� 3 but not in S�. In contrast to Msh 2 �/ � mice, deficiency in Msh 6 surprisingly did not change the characteristics of S�-S� 3 switch junctions. However, Msh 6 �/ � mice exhibited a change in the positioning of S � and S� 3 junctions. Although none of these changes were seen in Msh 3 �/ � mice, they had a higher percentage of large inserts in their switch junctions. Together, our data suggest that MutS homologues Msh 2, Msh 3, and Msh 6 play overlapping and distinct roles during antibody diversification processes.

40|$|Neurexins are {{synaptic}} {{plasma membrane}} proteins encoded by three genes (NRXN 1, - 2, - 3) with alternative promoters. Mutations in neurexin genes {{have been identified}} in different neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism. Recently, two point mutations altering the translation initiation site of NRXN 1 β (c. - 3 G>T and c. 3 G>T) have been described in patients with autism and mental retardation. In this study, we analyzed the NRXN 1 β gene in a sample of 153 patients with autism. We report the identification of a novel mutation, c. 3 G>A (p. Met 1), affecting the translation initiation site. Expression analysis showed that the c. 3 G>A <b>mutation</b> <b>switches</b> the translation start site of NRXN 1 β to an in-frame downstream methionine and decreases synaptic levels of the mutant protein in cultured neurons. These data reinforce a role for synaptic defects of NRXN 1 β in neurodevelopmental disorders. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Although H 5 N 1 {{influenza}} viruses {{have been}} responsible for hundreds of human infections, these avian influenza viruses have not fully adapted to the human host. The lack of sustained transmission in humans may be due, in part, to their avian-like receptor preference. Here, we have introduced receptor binding domain mutations within the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of two H 5 N 1 viruses and evaluated changes in receptor binding specificity by glycan microarray analysis. The impact of these mutations on replication efficiency was assessed in vitro and in vivo. Although certain <b>mutations</b> <b>switched</b> the receptor binding preference of the H 5 HA, the rescued mutant viruses displayed reduced replication in vitro and delayed peak virus shedding in ferrets. An improvement in transmission efficiency was not observed with any of the mutants compared to the parental viruses, indicating that alternative molecular changes are required for H 5 N 1 viruses to fully adapt to humans and to acquire pandemic capability.

40|$|Evolution of {{tumor cell}} phenotypes {{promotes}} heterogeneity and therapy resistance. Here {{we found that}} induction of CD 73, the enzyme that generates immunosuppressive adenosine, is linked to melanoma phenotype <b>switching.</b> Activating MAPK <b>mutations</b> and growth factors drove CD 73 expression, which marked both nascent and full activation of a mesenchymal-like melanoma cell state program. Proinflammatory cytokines like TNF alpha cooperated with MAPK signaling through the c-Jun/AP- 1 transcription factor complex to activate CD 73 transcription by binding to an intronic enhancer. In a mouse model of T-cell immunotherapy, CD 73 was induced in relapse melanomas, which acquired a mesenchymal-like phenotype. We also detected CD 73 upregulation in melanoma patients progressing under adoptive T-cell transfer or immune checkpoint blockade, arguing for an adaptive resistance mechanism. Our work substantiates CD 73 as a target to combine with current immunotherapies, but its dynamic regulation suggests limited value of CD 73 pretreatment expression as a biomarker to stratify melanoma patients.

40|$|Discrete {{tomography}} {{deals with}} the reconstruction of images from very few projections, which is, in the general case, an NP-hard problem. This paper describes a new memetic reconstruction algorithm. It generates a set of initial images by network flows, related {{to two of the}} input projections, and lets them evolve towards a possible solution, by using crossover and <b>mutation.</b> <b>Switch</b> and compactness operators improve the quality of the reconstructed images during each generation, while the selection of the best images addresses the evolution to an optimal result. One of the most important issues in discrete tomography is known as the stability problem and it is tackled here, in the case of noisy projections, along four directions. Extensive experiments have been carried out to evaluate the robustness of the new methodology. A comparison with the output of two other evolutionary algorithms and a generalized version of a deterministic method shows the effectiveness of our new algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) {{channels}} play {{a critical}} role in olfactory and visual transduction. Site-directed mutagenesis and inside-out patch-clamp recordings were used to investigate ion permeation and selectivity in two mutant homomeric rat olfactory CNGA 2 channels expressed in HEK 293 cells. A single point mutation of the negatively charged pore loop (P-loop) glutamate (E 342) to either a positively charged lysine or arginine resulted in functional channels, which consistently responded to cGMP, although the currents were generally extremely small. The concentration–response curve of the lysine mutant channel was very similar to that of wild-type (WT) channels, suggesting no major structural alteration to the mutant channels. Reversal potential measurements, during cytoplasmic NaCl dilutions, showed that the lysine and the arginine <b>mutations</b> <b>switched</b> the selectivity of the channel from cations (P Cl/P Na = 0. 07 [WT]) to anions (P Cl/P Na = 14 [Lys] or 10 [Arg]). Relative anion permeability sequences for the two mutant channels, measured with bi-ionic substitutions, were NO...|$|R
