Significant wave height of Windwaves- 05 model output was used to obtain such information, with surface level wind data for 11 years period (2000 to 2010) from NCEP-NOAA as the input. The model output data was then validated using multimission satellite altimeter data obtained from Aviso. Further, the data were used to identify areas of high waves based on the high wave’s classification by WMO. From all of the processing results, the wave characteristics in Indonesian waters were identified, especially on ALKI (Indonesian Archipelagic Sea Lanes).

40|$|The {{three most}} common crash types for drivers under age 18 are run-off-the-road crashes, left turn at {{intersection}} crashes, and rear end crashes. Previous literature points to novice drivers being {{less likely to}} anticipate hazards or maintain attention to the forward roadway {{and as a result}} failing to mitigate hazards by slowing adequately. ^ In two experiments using a fixed-based high fidelity driving simulator, two groups of drivers were evaluated in potential hazard scenarios. Anticipatory glances, slowing behaviors, and lane position of experienced drivers with exemplary records and newly licensed 16 – 18 year old drivers were compared at the two curves, two intersections, and two straight segments that were most heterogeneous relative to tasks and risk of all those negotiated. ^ In Experiment 1, experienced drivers {{were significantly more likely to}} make anticipatory (glance), and mitigation (slowing and lane keeping) responses when approaching locations of greatest risk. Experienced drivers crashed nine times and novice drivers crashed 23 times. Overall, experienced drivers began to slow approximately eight seconds before the incidents, slowed to target speed when within three seconds of the incident and selected <b>safer</b> <b>lane</b> positions than did novice drivers. ^ In Experiment 2, the ACT (Anticipate, Control, and Terminate) computer program was developed and utilized to train one group of novice drivers. The other group received placebo training. The ACT Program was designed to teach novice drivers to slow for HRECCS (pronounced wrecks). HRECCS is an acronym that explains the reasons a driver should slow (hidden obstacles, roadside hazards, no escape route, closing with no option to pass, curves, and traffic signals). Each participant completed a pre-test, training, saw the responses made by the experienced drivers, was offered mediated training (shown their mistakes and correct responses), and finally, completed a posttest. Placebo trained drivers had the same routine but rather than rules training and mediation, they received training related to street signs. ACT trained drivers made many more anticipatory glances, slowed to target speed more often and selected <b>safer</b> <b>lane</b> positions than did the placebo trained drivers.

An Extended Kalman Filter for estimating these parameters is used and the performance is improved by introducing a non-linear model which uses a road aligned, curved coordinate system.

Each lane-change maneuver was composed of 1) a preparatory period, 2) the actual steering initiative from the right lane to the left lane, and 3) a post-lane change period and was to be accomplished while maintaining a specified highway velocity. Lane deviation data showed that novice drivers had significantly more variance in lane position during the preparatory and post-lane change periods than experienced drivers. Novice drivers also spend significantly less time looking at the vehicle’s speedometer and mirrors.

40|$|International audienceMost {{survey methods}} {{developed}} to estimate abundance of killed animals on motorways may be biased {{due to the}} unequal detectability of carcasses, their persistence time on the lanes, and scavengers activities. Unbiased surveys are needed to evaluate the relationships between bird casualties (mortality), motorways characteristics, and the neighbouring avifauna. The present study conducted on four motorways in France, aimed to evaluate factors affecting persistence and encounter probabilities and variations in scavenging activity to obtain unbiased estimates of bird traffic casualties. Each motorway was surveyed once per season during multiple years and we used capture-recapture methods to estimate detection and carcass persistence rates. Results showed that surveys by car were as efficient as surveys by foot in detecting carcasses on the pavement, but less efficient for carcasses on verges. Passeriformes represented the most numerous casualties, and the Barn Owl (Tyto alba) was the most frequently killed species. Encounter probabilities were constant and high (0. 957 ± 0. 007). Average daily persistence probability was 0. 976 ± 0. 003. Persistence probabilities were higher for large and old carcasses, during summer, and differed between seasons, but were relatively similar between years. Scavenging activities, estimated using experimental carcasses disposed on the <b>safe</b> <b>lanes</b> of motorways, varied between years, seasons, and differed between diurnal and nocturnal periods.

40|$|Lane change (LC) is a {{maneuver}} {{that allows}} drivers {{to enter into}} a lane that suits their requirements and comfort. The LC process requires the driver to assess its neighborhood traffic in its original and target lanes before undertaking the maneuver.

The LC trajectory is determined by the accuracy of these subjective assessments as well as the state of traffic. An erroneous assessment by LC vehicle or neighboring vehicles or an incorrect maneuver can cause collision. The collision can be prevented if the LC trajectory can be predicted and the feasibility of LC can be communicated to different vehicles involved in this process [...] In the present paper, neural network is used for long term forecast of the lane change trajectory and for short term near future positions of the LC vehicle. The neural network is trained using past LC trajectories of different vehicles. The trained network is then used for long and short term forecast of the vehicle’s positions during LC.

40|$|Annually over 60. 000 {{people die}} and another 3. 7 million get injured in car {{accidents}} in the United States and Europe combined. Automation of vehicles {{can reduce the}} number of accidents by 90 %. Therefore, it is of great interest in academia and industry. For the automated vehicles that are being presented in industry however, proofs of safe performance are generally not found. Therefore, this thesis investigates approaches to automatically assess automated vehicle controller performance such as deviation overshoot and obtained lateral speeds. More specifically, this thesis studies so-called formal verification of the performance of a highway lane change controller. Because of its robustness properties, a Sliding Mode Control (SMC) strategy is selected and in this research several variations are designed. The availability of a lower level controller was assumed to generate the required steering torque, which results in a third order linear vehicle model. Nonlinear vehicle models with higher order dynamics were considered as well but showed to be too complex for the verification approach. Due to the switching nature of SMC, the closed loop system is modelled as a Hybrid System and as such verified using multiple verification packages. The abstraction based environment HSolver can provide full formal guarantees that account for intervals of parameter uncertainty, in this case initial deviation and lateral speed. However, in comparison with simulations using the Matlab Toolbox Breach–which only propagates distinct values and cannot provide formal guarantees for entire intervals–it suffers from a large over-approximation. Still, for a limited initial interval, HSolver analyses show that a SMC variant called Quasi Sliding Mode Control (QSMC) results in a <b>safe</b> <b>lane</b> change in terms of deviation overshoot. More advanced controllers show promising performance in Breach simulations. This suggests that techniques to reduce the over-approximation in HSolver, or developments in similar tools, can be very interesting to verify safety for more general situations in future research.

40|$|Toll plazas {{are one of}} the {{critical}} components of a roadway system for capital financing, infrastructure maintenance revenue, or traffic maintenance and congestion control strategies. At the same time, they are among the most complex road structures, as drivers are exposed to a large amount of information and have {{a short amount of time}} to make a decision. Since the advent of electronic toll collection (ETC) technology, the complexity of toll plazas has greatly increased. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of toll plaza design and traffic conditions on drivers’ behavior and level of safety. This study contains two approaches: (1) a microsimulation study using VISSIM and the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM); and (2) a driving simulation study. The microsimulation model was calibrated and validated using traffic data from recorded video at the West Springfield toll plaza, Massachusetts, connecting Interstate 90 to Interstate 91 and State Route 5. Distribution of traffic volumes, stop delays at cash lanes, and reduced speed distribution at electronic toll collection (ETC) lanes were used as vii calibration variables, and the number of conflicts was used as a validation parameter. Results identified that the <b>safest</b> <b>lane</b> configuration was the one consisting of only ETC lanes, and the second-safest configurations were the ones that grouped ETC lanes and separated them from cash lanes. In the second part of the study, a simulation model of the same toll plaza was created to be used in a fixed-base driving simulator with a 150 degree field of view. The objective of this part of the study was to investigate drivers’ behavior when they are exposed to different lane configurations and traffic conditions at toll plazas. Independent variables of this study were lane configuration (i. e., which lanes were signed as “E-ZPass” and “Cash”), origin-destination of the subject vehicle (i. e., right or left origin ramp, right or left destination ramp), traffic queue (i. e., having a queue or not), traffic composition (i. e., having a leading heavy vehicle or not), and customer type (i. e., cash or E-ZPass).

As part of the [...] "Rur Front", anti-tank ditches were dug two kilometres (2 km) west of the town in a semi-circular arc, minefields were sewn and infantry positions were constructed with extensively branched trenches {{in order to create a}} strong hedgehog defence. The first major carpet bombing air raid took place on 8 October 1944 over the town. During the second air raid on 6 December 1944 44 people died. Between the major carpet bomb attacks, non-stop fighter bomber raids went on from dawn to dusk and often into the night, continuing the work of destruction by strafing and bombing. From December 1944 the town also came within the range of allied artillery. During a further bombing raid on 16 January 1945, 31 people were killed, including 16 in one bunker on Anton Raky Allee. Amongst the SS combat troops, the command was issued from the top to the lowest level to pull out and they did so, as did the local party functionaries, who had been burning their records for days. The fourth and heaviest air raid on the now abandoned town took place on 23 February 1945. About 90 four-engined bombers flew over in two waves. Everything that had survived the war to that point now lay in ashes: the churches, the community hall, the courthouse, the swimming baths, the hospital, the schools and the kindergarten; only the tower of the Roman Catholic parish church remained standing, albeit badly damaged.
