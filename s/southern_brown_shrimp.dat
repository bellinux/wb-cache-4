40|$|Abstract The spatial {{distribution}} of the <b>southern</b> <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> Farfantepenaeus subtilis (Pérez-Farfante, 1967) was studied based on industrial fishing fleet activities and is associated with geological and oceanographic characteristics of the benthonic environments on the Amazon continental shelf. Using a geographical information system (GIS) this paper sought to calculate the relative abundance of brown shrimp based on catch per unit effort (CPUE) and compare it with bathymetry, type of sedimentary structure, sedimentation rate and bottom salinity. As a result, we {{have concluded that the}} relative abundance (in terms of CPUE) is not uniformly distributed in space. Spatial analysis indicates that commercial trawling efforts were made in the (foreset) region of the subaqueous Amazon delta at depths of 40 to 60 m. In this region, prawn are responsible for the bioturbation of the sediments {{and the creation of a}} sedimentary structure called mottled mud. In the foreset region, sedimentation rates progressively increased up to 10 cm. yr- 1; re-suspension was reduced and bottom salinity was high (~ 36). It appears that all of these factors define a stable muddy area with intense bioturbation. This notable biological activity is to be explained by the occurrence of a high F. subtilis abundance that appears to originate in a microbial loop. We concluded that by combining fishery information with environmental data from a GIS, it was possible to identify abundance distribution patterns for <b>southern</b> <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> and other economically important fishery resources and to understand how they change on a large spatial-scale...|$|E

Charybdis hellerii is also able to cause impacts on the local fisheries as the species can decrease the populations of native portunid crabs which are commercialized in the studied region. Macrobrachium rosenbergii may be sharing natural resources with the Amazon River prawn Macrobrachium amazonicum. Omobranchus punctatus shares habit with the native redlip blenny Ophioblennius atlanticus and other fishes, such as the frillfin goby Bathigobius soporator. Some immediate remedial measures to prevent further introductions from ballast water and shrimp farm ponds should be: (i) to prevent the release of ballast water by ship/vessels in the region; (ii) to reroute all effluent waters from shrimp rearing facilities through an underground or above-ground dry well; (iii) to install adequate sand and gravel filter which will allow passage of water but not livestock; (iv) outdoor shrimp pounds located on floodable land should be diked, and; (v) to promote environmental awareness of those directly involved with ballast water (crews of ship/vessels) and shrimp farms in the region.

The lowest survival at 14 d (57. 3 %) occurred in the Sole cramp pulse treatment, and this was significantly lower than in the group with the highest survival, the procedural control (70. 3 %). No effect of electrical stimulation on the severity of IBV infection was found. The lowest percentage of molts occurred in the repetitive mechanical stimulation treatment (14. 0 %), and this was significantly lower than in the group with the highest percentage of molts, the procedural control (21. 7 %). Additionally, the mechanically stimulated <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> that died during the experiment had a significantly larger size than the surviving individuals.

To find ways of reducing this by-catch, experiments were carried out with a Nordmøre type sorting grid during two trips on a research vessel and three trips on a commercial vessel. The results depended strongly on the catch composition in the <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery. If the catch composition did not cause clogging problems with the sorting grid, it met the objectives it was designed for. The reduction of fish (> 70 %) and benthos (65 %) in the catch was quite high. The commercial <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> catch was reduced by 15 %.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{developed}} and utilized a complex model approach to investigate the impact of stage-specific transport processes on the development and spatial distribution of <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Crangon crangon) post-larvae and juveniles in the German Bight. First, we focused on drift processes during the pelagic larval stage by coupling an individual-based model for egg and larval development 'off-line' to a 3 D hydrodynamic model utilizing the Lagrangian method. Secondly, we investigated tidal-induced transport processes after juvenile settlement. To determine the tidal cycle, the model coupling was accomplished 'on-line' by resolving the individual-based model and hydrodynamic model with the same time step. The vertical migration of juveniles, a prerequisite for the selective tidal stream transport (STST), was modelled as a sub-grid scale physical process (balance of forces: gravitation, buoyancy, Stoke's friction and dynamic uplift) and considered complex particle dynamics. We applied the model to test temperature and salinity cues as possible tidal indicators utilized by juvenile <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp.</b> Our results indicated that transport processes could significantly change the timing and spatial distribution of post-larval abundance. We also showed that the small-scale hydrodynamic forcing acting on the bodies of juvenile <b>brown</b> <b>shrimps</b> was sufficient {{to account for the}} vertical migration required to use STST. For both investigated tidal cues STST performing juvenile <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> were transported on-shore.

40|$|Winter fishery“ on <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> {{does not}} imply a special type of fishery.

During 1990 to 1999 mean European wide landings in January and February summedup to 854 tonnes making up to only 4 % of the mean annual landings (21 805 t). While German vessels landed 0. 7 % (68. 7 t) of their mean annual landings during that period, the other countries caught about 7 % of their individual, mean annual landings at the same time. The Netherlands and Denmark contributed highest tonnages of 580 and 110 tonnes, respectively, to the total European landings, making up 81 % of them. As about 70 % of <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> may carry eggs in January, the winter fishery took a mean total of about 2. 15 x 1012 <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> eggs out of the stocks in that period annually.

The governments of the North Sea <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> fisheries (Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, United Kingdom) have shown little interest in management of the shrimp fisheries, {{which leads to a}} consequent lack of action to establish a management system for shrimp, as well as little resources for research and monitoring. Initiatives in the Netherlands of the industry to self-manage their fisheries, in terms of effort limitation and/or landing, were not accepted by the Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM). Due to a lack of research, no ecological arguments for effort limitation were available and therefore any proposals by the industry to limit fishing effort and/or landings were deemed illegal price manipulations.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} Louisiana {{estuaries}} have indicated {{a central role}} of Spartina alterniflora marshes in supporting production of the commercially important <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Farfantepenaeus aztecus. <b>Brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> are an estuarine-dependent species and spend one to three springtime months in estuaries as small juveniles, with highest shrimp densities found at marsh edges. Later estuarine and offshore production of <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> is correlated both with marsh area and with abundance of smaller juveniles found in unvegetated open bays near marshes. This paper investigates the idea that open bays are an additional important nursery habitat for Louisiana <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp,</b> with bays possibly supporting the bulk of shrimp populations even while shrimp densities expressed on a square meter basis are lower in the bays. To assay possible differences in shrimp abundances and residency in marsh ponds vs. adjacent open bays, springtime field work was conducted in 2004 - 2006 near the Louisiana University Marine Consortium Laboratory at Cocodrie, Louisiana. Seine surveys showed similar-sized shrimp were present in marsh ponds (< 20 m in diameter) and an adjacent open bay (< 1 m deep, 2 km in diameter) and that shrimp were twice as dense in the marsh ponds. Natural C, N, and S isotope tags provided distinctive labeling of shrimp from marsh ponds versus bays; shrimp residency appeared high in both areas with < 10 % of shrimp present as immigrants from other areas. Widely spaced collections from several Louisiana bay systems and also Galveston Bay, Texas showed that the S isotope tags provided the most general tags for marsh origins, with low S isotope values of 1 - 9 頩n shrimp muscle tissue consistently indicating marsh origins.

40|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Crangon crangon) {{fishery is}} {{economically}} {{one of the}} most important fisheries in the North Sea. Fishing is unregulated, apart from the number of licenses and technical measures. The fishery has long been considered sustainable in terms of the effect on the target species, even though annual stocks are not regularly assessed. Average landings constantly increased annually and since 2000 have been 40 % higher than in the 1980 s and 1990 s. Because <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> lack a clear age structure and reproduce almost year-round, an agebased stock assessment is not possible. In the absence of a formal estimate of stock size, it is difficult to judge whether current fishing practices can still be considered sustainable. Here, we use annual survey data collected during peak occurrence in late summer to obtain a depth- and area-stratified, swept-area estimate for the period 1970 – 2015. The resulting estimate of the total commercial-size shrimp biomass varied between 4000 and 21 000 tonnes over the years. Both parametric and non-parametric methods arrived at very similar results. In combination with length-based mortality estimates (as a proxy for production/biomass ratio), knowledge on the seasonal occurrence, catchability, gear efficiency, and their variation, total adult annual biomass production was estimated. Values ranged between 38 000 and 216 000 tonnes and overlapped at the lower end with total annual commercial landings, which varied between 8000 and 38 500 tonnes, indicating that in some years (1977, 1998, 2007), the larger part of the total <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> production was harvested.

Furthermore, moderate levels of hypoxia have been associated with reduced metabolism and growth rates in <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp.</b> This research estimates the economic effect of hypoxia induced habitat degradation on the North Carolina <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery through econometric modeling of supply and demand. Based on this analysis, the demand for NC <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> appears perfectly elastic and determined mostly by the world market, and that the supply is inelastic, determined by environmental factors. Furthermore, a hypothetical 30 % reduction in hypoxic days would increase producer surplus by almost $ 2. 5 million annually. This suggests that in this overcapitalized fishery, reductions in hypoxia could be a valuable mechanism to increase rents to fishers, assuming further entry is prohibited. These results also highlight the need for a continued focus on whole ecosystem based management regarding North Carolina fisheries, and greater alignment of land use policy and fishery habitat conservation goals in the Neuse River estuary...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} climate {{variability}} on the shrimp fishery {{in the upper}} Gulf of California and {{the west coast of}} southern Baja California was investigated using artisanal and industrial catches of blue shrimp (Litopenaeus stylirostris) and <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Farfantepenaeus califor-niensis). Catch data were compared with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and remotely sensed environmental parameters, includ-ing sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a, coloured dissolved organic matter, and particulate organic carbon (Rrs 412 and Rrs 490). Overall, temperature was the best environmental indicator of commercial shrimp catches. Catches of blue shrimp varied directly and of <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> indirectly with the SOI in their dominant areas, suggesting that the two species are influenced by El Niño con-ditions in different ways...|$|R
40|$|The fishery for <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Crangon crangon) in the North Sea {{is carried}} out by more than 600 vessels, with total annual <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> {{landings}} of around 20, 000 t. Due to the small mesh size used, the catches also contain large amounts of unwanted by-catch. To find ways of reducing this by-catch, experiments were carried out during a one-year period with a sieve net rigged in a <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> beam trawl. It was tested for its selective properties and an evaluation was made of its operational characteristics. The loss of commercial shrimp catch when using a sieve net was 15 % or less in favourable conditions. Certain components of the catch can. however, lead to a distortion of the outlet with a reduction of the commercial catch of over 30 %. It is likely that technical alterations to the outlet can prevent this. The sieve net showed very poor selective properties for commercial fish species with a length below 10 cm. Above 10 cm the selection improved with increasing length. Especially for Age 1 and older fish, this selective device serves its purpose. A significant reduction of non-commercial fish and invertebrates was also observed...|$|R
40|$|Among {{other tasks}} the “Working Group on Crangon Fisheries and Life Cycle” of the “International Council for the Exploration of the Sea” {{collects}} data on landings and {{effort in the}} North Sea <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> fisheries by country. Landings per unit effort data are calculated and all are compared on basis of long-term series {{as well as on}} seasonal basis. The development for each country is described and compared for the year 2001 to the ten-year average from 1992 to 2001 were possible, as some data are missing especially for the Netherlands. While the Dutch and British fleets increased their landings substantially in 2001 compared to the previous years, Danish,German and Belgian fishermen had reduced landings. There are regional differences in fishing pattern between the countries, especially Denmark versus the rest of Europe. Effort measures remain incomparable between the countries, and fluctuations in landings per unit effort data seem to be in a normal biological range, giving no reason for concern at present for the situation of <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> stocks in the North Sea. An improvement of the data basis is required and possibly achievable by the EU logbook system being in force for <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> fisheries as well...|$|R
40|$|The Ministry of Agriculture, Conservation and Food quality, Producer organisations of the Dutch shrimp {{fisheries}} and NGO’s (Stichting de Noordzee and Waddenvereniging) have underlined {{the importance of}} sustainable harvesting of <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> in the North Sea and Wadden Sea. Also they would like the <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery to meet the conditions of an MSC (Marine Stewardship Council) certificate. The first principle that the shrimp fishery needs to fulfil in order to acquire an MSC-label states that the stock should not be overfished. The biomass dynamic model has been investigated. This model does not need demographic data and was used successfully in Northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis). The model only needs {{the total amount of}} shrimp landings and an index of catches per unit of effort (CPUE) to assess the stock. The main assumptions of the model are (1) the stock under study is a single stock and (2) the available index (CPUE, catch per unit of effort series) describes the trends in the population well. The main conclusion from the study is that the applicability of the biomass model for a reliable stock assessment of <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> needs considerably more study and data collection...|$|R
40|$|Simulations {{based on}} a yield-per-recruit model were {{performed}} to analyze the impact ofg rowth overfishing on <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Penaeus aztecus, and to assess {{the effects of a}} closed season inshore and offshore of the Mexican States of Tamaulipas and Veracruz. Closure of both the inshore and offshore fisheries could enhance cohort yield by more than 300 %. Cohon yield enhancement would be only about 60 - 80 % if only the offshore season were closed. The closed season of 1993 gave better results as it covered a larger part of the <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> peak recruitment period. Catch per unit of effort (CPUE) after closure in 1993, compared with 1994, was 2. 4 times higher than the mean CPUE of the month. Total annual offshore yield increased 72 % in 1993 (3, 800 metric tons (t)) and 10 % in 1994 (506 t) with respect to the mean annual offshore catch during the 10 -year period prior to the 1993 closure. Simulation results could help identify alternatives that permit the coexistence of the inshore and offshore fisheries while maintaining high profitability of the <b>brown</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery...|$|R
