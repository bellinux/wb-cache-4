40|$|The {{application}} {{of an active}} control force on a thin-walled acoustic boundary can modify the motional dynamics, and so influence the impedance presented to incident waves. This impedance determines transmission of acoustic energy, reflection of acoustic waves from the boundary and absorption of incident energy. This thesis studies control systems that generate control forces for the active control of surface acoustic impedance. The proposed systems rely on measurement of the acoustic pressure and surface velocity of the boundary. The systems can use adaptive digital signal processing, which offers significant advantages over non-adaptive techniques. The active control of the <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> impedance of a loudspeaker that terminates a waveguide for axially propagating plane waves provides a motivating problem. Theoretical analysis establishes the control of <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> impedance of a simple compliantly-suspended piston by a control force. Operational constraints of a physical piston define theoretical operating limits for controlled <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> impedances. The control systems use either feedback or feed-forward techniques for which theoretical treatment reveals restrictions on the range of controlled <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> impedance. A novel result is that conventional implementations of the control systems can be unstable for certain desired impedances unless feedback cancellation is used. Digital feedback techniques are less effective for broader frequency bandwidth where feed-forward techniques may work. Theoretical analysis produces solutions that confirm the feasibility of these control techniques for the active control of <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> impedance. Potential errors {{in the implementation of}} the systems have predictable effects on the controlled <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> impedance. Experimental results support the theoretical work presented in this thesis, demonstrating active control of <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> impedance for normally incident acoustic plane waves.

40|$|Abstract—Measurements {{of middle}} ear (ME) {{acoustic}} power flow (power reflectance, power absorption, and transmittance) and normalized impedance (<b>acoustic</b> resistance, <b>acoustic</b> <b>reactance,</b> and impedance magnitude) were compared for their utility in clin-ical applications. Transmittance, {{a measure of}} the acoustic power absorbed by the ME, was found to have several important advan-tages over other measures of acoustic power flow. In addition to its simple and audiologically relevant physical interpretation (absorbed power), the normal transmittance curve has a simple shape that is visually similar to the ME transfer function. The acoustic impedance measures (resistance and reactance) provided important additional information about ME status and supple-mented transmittance measurements. Together these measure-ments can help identify unusual conditions such as eardrum perforations. While this article is largely a review of the develop...|$|R

50|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>reactance</b> represents, as well, the {{pressure}} {{that is out of}} phase with the motion and causes no average energy transfer. For example, a closed bulb connected to an organ pipe will have air moving into it and pressure, but they are out of phase so no net energy is transmitted into it. While {{the pressure}} rises, air moves in, and while it falls, it moves out, but the average pressure when the air moves in is the same as that when it moves out, so the power flows back and forth but with no time averaged energy transfer. The electrical analogy for this is a capacitor connected across a power line. Current flows through the capacitor but it is out of phase with the voltage, so no net power is transmitted into it.|$|R

The equation for the velocity distribution between the planes is developed and several typical profiles are presented graphically. The equation for the acoustic impedance per unit area of plane is obtained.

30|$|This paper studies a novel audio segmentation-by-classification {{approach}} {{based on}} factor analysis. The proposed technique compensates the within-class variability by using class-dependent factor loading matrices and obtains the scores by computing the log-likelihood ratio {{for the class}} model to a non-class model over fixed-length windows. Afterwards, these scores are smoothed to yield longer contiguous segments of the same class by means of different back-end systems. Unlike previous solutions, our proposal does not make use of <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> features and does not need a hierarchical structure. The proposed method is applied to segment and classify audios coming from TV shows into five different acoustic classes: speech, music, speech with music, speech with noise, and others. The technique is compared to a hierarchical system with <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> features achieving a significant error reduction.|$|R
30|$|In the BN domain, where {{speech is}} {{typically}} interspersed with music, background noise and other <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> events, audio segmentation is primarily required for indexing, subtitling, and retrieval. However, speech technologies that work on such {{type of data}} can also benefit from the acoustic segmentation output in terms of overall performance. In particular, the acoustic models used in automatic speech recognition (ASR) or speaker diarization can be trained for <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> conditions, such as clean studio versus noisy outdoor speech, or high-quality wide-bandwidth studio versus low-quality narrow-bandwidth telephone speech. Also, audio segmentation may improve the efficiency of low bit-rate audio coders, as it allows for merging the traditionally separated speech and the music codec designs into a universal coding scheme, which keeps the reproduction quality of both speech and music [14].|$|R

This can happen only when the effective particle velocity increases, this turn means that dispersion forces should be active in mixtures, a result anticipated {{in the absence of}} any specific interactions such as hydrogen bonding. On the contrary, the Z values in 1 -propanol are lower indicating hydrogen bonding. The values of <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> impedance (Z) decreased with increase in percentage of 1 -propanol and 2 -propanol at different temperatures (Figs.  13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18).
