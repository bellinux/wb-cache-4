5|$|Multiple-tube seed drill: The wooden <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> {{existed in}} China by the 3rd century BC, while the multiple-tube iron <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> was first invented in China by the 2nd century BC, during the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD). The <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> allowed for greater speed and {{regulation}} of distributing seeds in lined rows of crops instead of casting them {{out onto the}} farm field.|$|E
5|$|The Han-era Chinese used {{bronze and}} iron {{to make a}} range of weapons, culinary tools, carpenters' tools and {{domestic}} wares. A significant product of these improved iron-smelting techniques was the manufacture of new agricultural tools. The three-legged iron <b>seed</b> <b>drill,</b> invented by the 2nd century BC, enabled farmers to carefully plant crops in rows instead of casting seeds out by hand. The heavy moldboard iron plow, also invented during the Han dynasty, required only one man to control it, two oxen to pull it. It had three plowshares, a seed box for the drills, a tool which turned down the soil and could sow roughly 45,730 m2 (11.3 acres) of land in a single day.|$|E
5|$|Louche: The louche (耬車) was {{a mobile}} animal-drawn {{agricultural}} <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> invented by the Chinese agronomist Zhao Guo, a Han official {{in charge of}} agricultural production {{during the reign of}} Han Wudi in the Han dynasty. According to the records of Political Commentator by the Eastern Han dynasty writer Cui Shi, the Louche consisted of three feet and thus was called three-legged Lou. The three legs had three ditch diggers under it used for sowing. The Louche was animal powered and was pulled by an ox and the leg of the Louche directly dug a ditch in the flattened soil, sowed the seeds, covered the seeds, and pressed the land flat at the same time. The machine was known for its utility and efficiency for serving several agricultural uses at the same time, while saving time and effort.|$|E

30|$|Direct-seeding {{cultivation}} by deep-seeding of <b>seeds</b> (<b>drill</b> <b>seeding)</b> {{is becoming}} {{popular due to}} the scarcity of land and labor. However, poor emergence and inadequate seedling establishment can lead to yield loss in direct-seeding cultivation by deep-sowing. In rice, mesocotyl and coleoptile are primarily responsible for seedling emergence from deeper levels of soil.|$|R
40|$|In this research, sowing {{rate and}} seed {{distribution}} of furrow openers of pneumatic <b>seed</b> <b>drills</b> were determined. In addition, sowing rates {{given in the}} machine catalogue were compared with test results. Coefficient of variation of the seed distribution of the furrow openers were less than that 4 % given in the literature as maximum value for evaluating of <b>seed</b> <b>drills.</b> Amount of distributed seed from the furrow openers varied between 3 % and 12 %. Test results of sowing rates were less than that the catalogue value of sowing machine but differences were not significant statistically...|$|R
5|$|Modern {{archaeologists have}} {{unearthed}} Han iron farming tools throughout China, from Inner Mongolia {{in the north}} to Yunnan in the south. The spade, shovel, pick, and plow were used for tillage, the hoe for weeding, the rake for loosening the soil, and the sickle for harvesting crops. Depending on their size, Han plows were driven by either one ox or two oxen. Oxen were also used to pull the three-legged iron <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> (invented in Han China by the 2nd century BCE), which enabled farmers to plant seeds in precise rows instead of casting them out by hand. While artwork of the Wei (220–265 CE) and Jin (265–420 CE) periods show use of the harrow for breaking up chunks of soil after plowing, it perhaps first appeared in China during the Eastern Han (25–220 CE). Irrigation works for agriculture included the use of water wells, artificial ponds and embankments, dams, canals, and sluice gates.|$|E
5|$|Wrought iron: During the Han dynasty, new iron {{smelting}} processes led to {{the manufacture}} of new wrought iron implements for use in agriculture, such as the multi-tube <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> and iron plough. In addition to accidental lumps of low-carbon wrought iron produced by excessive injected air in ancient Chinese cupola furnaces. The ancient Chinese created wrought iron by using the finery forge at least by the 2nd century BC, the earliest specimens of cast and pig iron fined into wrought iron and steel found at the early Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) site at Tieshengguo. Pigott speculates that the finery forge existed in the previous Warring States period (403–221 BC), {{due to the fact}} that there are wrought iron items from China dating to that period and there is no documented evidence of the bloomery ever being used in China. The fining process involved liquifying cast iron in a fining hearth and removing carbon from the molten cast iron through oxidation. Wagner writes that in addition to the Han Dynasty hearths believed to be fining hearths, there is also pictoral evidence of the fining hearth from a Shandong tomb mural dated 1st to 2nd century AD, as well as a hint of written evidence in the 4th century AD Daoist text Taiping Jing.|$|E

25|$|Due to China's {{status as}} a {{developing}} country and its severe shortage of arable land, farming in China has always been very labor-intensive. However, throughout its history, various methods have been developed or imported that enabled greater farming production and efficiency. They also utilized the <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> to help improve on row farming.|$|E
25|$|The <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> {{was also}} {{developed}} during this period, allowing farmers to drill seeds in precise rows, instead of casting them out randomly. During {{the reign of}} Emperor Wu of Han, The 'Dai Tian Fa', an early form of crop rotation was introduced. Farmers divided their land into two portions, one {{of which would be}} planted, the other being left fallow.|$|E
25|$|The Indian {{economy was}} large and prosperous under the Mughal Empire, up until the 18th century. Sean Harkin {{estimates}} China and India may have accounted for 60 to 70 percent of world GDP in the 17th century. The Mughal economy functioned on an elaborate system of coined currency, land revenue and trade. Gold, silver and copper coins were issued by the royal mints which functioned {{on the basis of}} free coinage. The political stability and uniform revenue policy resulting from a centralised administration under the Mughals, coupled with a well-developed internal trade network, ensured that India–before the arrival of the British–was to a large extent economically unified, despite having a traditional agrarian economy characterised by a predominance of subsistence agriculture, with 64% of the workforce in the primary sector (including agriculture), but with 36% of the workforce also in the secondary and tertiary sectors, higher than in Europe, where 65–90% of its workforce were in agriculture in 1700 and 65–75% were in agriculture in 1750. Agricultural production increased under Mughal agrarian reforms, with Indian agriculture being advanced compared to Europe at the time, such as the widespread use of the <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> among Indian peasants before its adoption in European agriculture, and higher per-capita agricultural output and standards of consumption.|$|E

500|$|Horse-powered {{agricultural}} implements were improved during this period. By 1600, a lighter plough {{which could be}} drawn by two horses, the [...] "Dutch plough", was used in eastern England; this was followed in 1730 by the lightweight Rotherham plough, an unwheeled, or [...] "swing" [...] plough. It was advertised as reducing ploughing times by a third, or using a third less horsepower for the same ploughing time. The improved <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> and horse-hoe were invented by Jethro Tull in 1731; but {{it took more than}} 100 years for these designs to come into common use. The earliest horse-powered threshing machines, which were installed permanently in barns, were developed {{towards the end of the}} 18th century.|$|E
500|$|Inventions and {{discoveries of}} the English include: the jet engine, the first {{industrial}} spinning machine, the first {{computer and the}} first modern computer, the World Wide Web along with HTML, the first successful human blood transfusion, the motorised vacuum cleaner, the lawn mower, the seat belt, the hovercraft, the electric motor, steam engines, and theories such as the Darwinian theory of evolution and atomic theory. Newton developed the ideas of universal gravitation, Newtonian mechanics, and calculus, and Robert Hooke his eponymously named law of elasticity. Other inventions include the iron plate railway, the thermosiphon, tarmac, the rubber band, the mousetrap, [...] "cat's eye" [...] road marker, joint development of the light bulb, steam locomotives, the modern <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> and many modern techniques and technologies used in precision engineering.|$|E
500|$|The {{mechanisation}} and rationalisation {{of agriculture}} was another important factor. Robert Bakewell and Thomas Coke introduced selective breeding, and initiated {{a process of}} inbreeding to maximise desirable traits from the mid 18th century, such as the New Leicester sheep. Machines were invented to improve the efficiency of various agricultural operation, such as Jethro Tull's <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> of 1701 that mechanised seeding at the correct depth and spacing and Andrew Meikle's threshing machine of 1784. Ploughs were steadily improved, from Joseph Foljambe's Rotherham iron plough in 1730 to James Small's improved [...] "Scots Plough" [...] metal in 1763. In 1789 Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies was producing 86 plough models for different soils. Powered farm machinery began with Richard Trevithick's stationary steam engine, used to drive a threshing machine, in 1812. Mechanisation spread to other farm uses through the 19th century. The first petrol-driven tractor was built in America by John Froelich in 1892.|$|E
40|$|Agricultural Engineering Department, College of Agriculture, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi ArabiaThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the mechanization provisions as well as the uniformity of level of mechanization among the modern farms in Saudi Arabia. Field data of 56 farms was studied on the basis of tractor power and implement size available per unit area. The average tractor power per hectare was found to be 1. 84 kw. The width of machines and implements such as combines, chisels, moldboards, <b>seed</b> <b>drills</b> and bailers were 0. 051, 0. 052, 0. 026, 0. 047 and 0. 025 m. /ha. The average number of tractors per farm was 2. 32 and that for combines, chisels, moldboards, <b>seed</b> <b>drills</b> and bailers were 1. 21, 1. 43, 1. 43, 1. 26 and 1. 20, respectively. On the basis of width of machine or implement per unit area, the acquirement of farmers for tractors, chisels and moldboards was inconsistent. However, the acquirement of the combine and <b>seed</b> <b>drills</b> on the basis of the machine width per unit area was more con-sistent. Improper selection of tractors and/or implements was attributed to lack of technical data and farm-ing experience among the farmers...|$|R

500|$|The {{contemporaneous}} Peiligang and Pengtoushan cultures {{represent the}} oldest Neolithic cultures of China and were formed around 7000 BC. Some {{of the first}} inventions of Neolithic China include semilunar and rectangular stone knives, stone hoes and spades, the cultivation of millet, rice, and the soybean, the refinement of sericulture, the building of rammed earth structures with lime-plastered house floors, the creation of pottery with cord-mat-basket designs, the creation of pottery tripods and pottery steamers {{and the development of}} ceremonial vessels and scapulimancy for purposes of divination. The British sinologist Francesca Bray argues that the domestication of the ox and buffalo during the Longshan culture (c. 3000–c. 2000 BC) period, the absence of Longshan-era irrigation or high-yield crops, full evidence of Longshan cultivation of dry-land cereal crops which gave high yields [...] "only when the soil was carefully cultivated," [...] suggest that the plough was known at least by the Longshan culture period and explains the high agricultural production yields which allowed the rise of Chinese civilization during the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600–c. 1050 BC). With later inventions such as the multiple-tube <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> and heavy moldboard iron plough, China's agricultural output could sustain a much larger population.|$|E
500|$|There {{were great}} {{innovations}} in metallurgy. In addition to Zhou-dynasty China's (c. 1050 BCE– 256 BCE) previous inventions {{of the blast}} furnace and cupola furnace to make [...] pig iron and cast iron, respectively, the Han period saw the development of steel and wrought iron by use of the finery forge and puddling process. With the drilling of deep boreholes into the earth, the Chinese used not only derricks to lift brine {{up to the surface}} to be boiled into salt, but also set up bamboo-crafted pipeline transport systems which brought natural gas as fuel to the furnaces. Smelting techniques were enhanced with inventions such as the waterwheel-powered bellows; the resulting widespread distribution of iron tools facilitated the growth of agriculture. For tilling the soil and planting straight rows of crops, the improved heavy-moldboard plough with three iron plowshares and sturdy multiple-tube iron <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> were invented in the Han, which greatly enhanced production yields and thus sustained population growth. The method of supplying irrigation ditches with water was improved with the invention of the mechanical chain pump powered by the rotation of a waterwheel or draft animals, which could transport irrigation water up elevated terrains. The waterwheel was also used for operating trip hammers in pounding grain and in rotating the metal rings of the mechanical-driven astronomical armillary sphere representing the celestial sphere around the Earth.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> is a {{mechanical}} device for spacing and planting seed {{at the appropriate}} depth. [...] It originated in ancient China before the 1st century BC.

[...] The <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> also saved planting labor. [...] Most importantly, the <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> meant crops were grown in rows, which reduced competition of plants and increase yields. [...] It was reinvented in 16th century Europe based on verbal descriptions and crude drawings brought back from China. [...] Jethro Tull patented a version in 1700; however, it was expensive and unreliable. [...] Reliable seed drills appeared in the mid 19th century.|$|E
30|$|Many of {{the early}} <b>seed</b> <b>drills,</b> used for grains and other {{agricultural}} crops, were used for seeding reclaimed ground.

2500|$|Jethro Tull invented an {{improved}} <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> in 1701.
