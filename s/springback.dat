50|$|<b>Springback</b> is a {{particularly}} critical aspect of sheet metal forming. Even relatively small amounts of <b>springback</b> in structures that are formed to a significant depth may cause the blank to distort {{to the point that}} tolerances cannot be held. New materials such as high strength steel, aluminum and magnesium are particularly prone to <b>springback.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cold worked items {{suffer from}} a {{phenomenon}} known as <b>springback,</b> or elastic <b>springback.</b> After the deforming force {{is removed from the}} workpiece, the workpiece springs back slightly. The amount a material springs back is equal to the yield strain (the strain at the yield point) for the material.|$|E
50|$|Chaboche type {{material}} {{models are}} sometimes used to simulate <b>springback</b> effects in sheet metal forming. These and other advanced plasticity models require the experimental determination of cyclic stress-strain curves. Test rigs {{have been used}} to measure material properties that when used in simuilations provide excellent correlation between measured and calculated <b>springback.</b>|$|E
50|$|Close {{tolerances}} {{are possible}} as <b>springback</b> can be significantly reduced.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{material}} properties, the sheet may be overbent {{to compensate for}} <b>springback.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Springback</b> - It is {{the ability}} of a wire to go through large {{deflections}} without being permanently deformed.|$|E

50|$|Hollow, {{metallic}} Wills Rings {{are used}} as they have better <b>springback</b> than yielding soft metal seals and higher temperature limits than elastomer O rings.|$|E
50|$|While <b>springback</b> {{has long}} been a topic of {{discussion}} for sheet metal forming operations it has been far less of a topic of research for tube hydroforming. This may in part be a result of the relatively low levels of <b>springback</b> naturally occurring when deforming the tubes into their closed section geometries. Tube Hydroformed sections by the nature of their closed sections are very rigid and do not display high degrees of elastic deformation under load. For this reason it is likely that negative residual stress induced during tube hydroforming might be insufficient to deform the part elastically after the completion of forming. However, as more and more tubular parts are being manufactured using high strength steel and advanced high strength steel parts, <b>springback</b> must be accounted for in the design and manufacture of closed section tube hydroformed parts.|$|E
50|$|In the GDR, a <b>springback</b> binder in A5 format {{was part}} of a first grader's typical equipment.During the school year, it was filled with {{exercise}} sheets that were distributed one by one.|$|E
5000|$|This method will {{typically}} bottom or coin {{the material}} to set the edge to help overcome <b>springback.</b> In this bending method, the radius of the bottom die determines the final bending radius.Manual setup ...|$|E
5000|$|Niti wires {{are known}} to have another unique {{property}} known as Superelasticity. It is the [...] "rubber-like" [...] behavior present in the Niti shape memory alloy. Superelastic Niti wires have excellent <b>springback</b> compared to other niti wires. They can also deliver constant forces over large wire-deflection.|$|E
50|$|Incorrect setups can be non-intuitive. For example, {{due to the}} <b>springback</b> effect, a seam {{can appear}} loose, when in reality it was closed too tight and has opened up like a spring. For this reason, {{experienced}} operators and good seamer setup are critical to ensure that double seams are properly closed.|$|E
50|$|Higher {{strength}} steels {{may help}} reducing the weight by downgaging (i.e., use of thinner sheets), while increasing the crashworthiness. However, {{one problem with}} many high strength steels is that their formability is generally lower than milder grades. In addition, <b>springback</b> and die wear also cause problems as the forming stresses and contact pressures are higher.|$|E
50|$|After {{almost three}} months, {{the band was}} back at United Kingdom for their second tour. They {{performed}} at Cavern Club (Liverpool, England) on August 31, at Ten Foundation (Belfast, Northern Ireland) on November 2, at Benwell & <b>Springback</b> Club (Newcastle upon Tyne) on November 7 and at The Dome (London) on November 9, 2014.|$|E
50|$|Air bending's angle {{accuracy}} is approximately Â±0.5 deg. Angle {{accuracy is}} ensured by applying a {{value to the}} width of the V opening, ranging from 6 T (six times material thickness) for sheets to 3 mm thick to 12 T for sheets more than 10 mm thick. <b>Springback</b> depends on material properties, influencing the resulting bend angle.|$|E
50|$|The list {{of factors}} may be continued. <b>Springback</b> {{assessment}} of final formed products {{is a difficult}} problem and {{is affected by the}} complexity of the formed shape. The NUMISHEET 93 conference benchmark problem involves the draw bending of a U-channel using three measured parameters. Parameterless approaches have been proposed for more complex geometries but need validation.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{the older}} AA-1350 alloy {{previously}} used, these AA-8000 series alloys also retain their tensile strength after the standard current cycle test or the Current Cycle Submersion Test (CCST), {{as described in}} ANSI C119.4:2004. Depending on the annealing grade, AA-8176 may elongate up to 30% with less <b>springback</b> effect and possesses a higher yield strength (19.8 KSI for a coldworked AA-8076 wire).|$|E
50|$|Sheet {{metal forming}} {{simulation}} is {{a technology that}} calculates the process of sheet metal stamping, predicting common defects such as splits, wrinkles, <b>springback</b> and material thinning. Also known as forming simulation, the technology is a specific application of non-linear finite element analysis. The technology has many benefits in the manufacturing industry, especially the automotive industry, where lead time to market, cost and lean manufacturing are {{critical to the success}} of a company.|$|E
50|$|For other {{sheet metal}} forming {{operations}} like drawing it entails deforming the sheet metal past the planned net shape of the part, so that when <b>springback</b> is released from the part, the plastic deformation in that part delivers the desired shape of the part. In the case of complex tools the spring back has to be already considered in the engineering and construction phases. Therefore complex software simulations are used.Frequently {{this is not enough}} to deliver the desired results. In such cases practical experiments are done, using the trial-and-error plus experience method to correct the tool.However the results (workpieces) are only stable, if all influencing factors are the same.|$|E
50|$|The <b>springback</b> binder {{resembles the}} outer {{parts of a}} {{hardcover}} book, with a spine, a front cover, and a back cover.The spine however includes a steel spring, whose job it is, to hold together the inner book, {{as soon as it}} is inserted.When the front and back covers are pushed apart by more than 270 degrees, the spring will open, and the inner book can be inserted, removed or supplemented by individual leaves.The process takes only a few seconds, and the finished bound book is like a book with hard cover.Typical paper sizes are A4 and A5, or their equivalent, the maximum stack height is usually 2 cm.|$|E
50|$|The major {{advantage}} {{of this process is}} that it can form large and complex workpieces in one operation. The finished product has excellent precision and a fine surface finish. It also does not suffer from <b>springback</b> or residual stresses. Products can also be made larger to eliminate assemblies or reduce weight, which is critical in aerospace applications. Lower strength required and less tooling costs. McDonnell Douglas utilized SPF design and production technology into the F-15 in the 1980s. They developed the production equipment and tooling technology in St. Louis using both heated platen presses and quartz lamp tooling technology through the leadership of Engineers Ray Kittelson, Vern Mueller, and David Rohe.|$|E
50|$|Conferences are {{normally}} scheduled for May or June in Europe, North America or Asia. However, most conferences {{are held in}} Europe {{because the majority of}} the current membership resides in Europe. Conferences start with an informal reception on Sunday evening followed by two and a half days of technical sessions. Ample time is allowed for technical discussion, and various social events are scheduled in association with the conference. Typical topics include machinery and press tools, new processes, new materials, experimental methods for evaluating formability and studying press operations, <b>springback,</b> constitutive equations, plasticity criteria, and friction and wear with attention to interface behavior as characterized by topography and surface chemistry, lubrication, speed, and temperature.|$|E
50|$|In bottoming, {{the sheet}} is forced against the V {{opening in the}} bottom tool. U-shaped {{openings}} cannot be used. Space is left between the sheet and {{the bottom of the}} V opening. The optimum width of the V opening is 6 T (T stands for material thickness) for sheets about 3 mm thick, up to about 12 T for 12 mm thick sheets. The bending radius must be at least 0.8 T to 2 T for sheet steel. Larger bend radius require about the same force as larger radii in air bending, however, smaller radii require greater forceâup to five times as muchâthan air bending. Advantages of bottoming include greater accuracy and less <b>springback.</b> A disadvantage is that a different tool set is needed for each bend angle, sheet thickness, and material. In general, air bending is the preferred technique.|$|E
50|$|NiTi alloy was {{developed}} in 1960 by William F. Buehler {{who worked at the}} Naval Ordinance Laboratory in Silver Springs, Maryland. The name Nitinol came from Nickel (Ni), Titanium (Ti), Naval Ordinance Laboratory (nol). The first Nickel titanium (NiTi) orthodontic alloy, introduced by Andraeson. This alloy was based on the research done by Buehler. Since their introduction, the wires made out of Niti alloys have become an important part of orthodontic treatment. The composition of the wire has 55% Nickel and 45% Titanium. The first nickel-titanium orthodontic wire alloy was marketed by the Unitek Corporation who are now known as 3M Unitek. These alloys have low stiffness, superelasticity, high <b>springback,</b> large elastic range and were brittle. The initial niti wires did not have shape-memory effect due to the cold-working of the wire. Thus these wires were passive and were considered as an Martensitic-Stabilized alloy.|$|E
50|$|Although a {{clean and}} unoiled valve of a well {{maintained}} instrument should move without unusual force, {{the inside of a}} musical instrument is a very inhospitable environment for a delicate valve mechanism. The musician constantly blows warm moist air through the valve. To make matters worse, impurities may be blown from the musician's mouth into the instrument. Even if nothing grows in the valve, the condensation and changing temperature of the metal can cause an untreated valve to bind, possibly resulting in a stuck valve. Even a minor binding of a valve affects the playability of the instrument and is at least very annoying. Also, woodwind musicians use valve oil (called key oil for woodwinds since they do not have valves, they have keys) to lubricate the mechanism of the keys to improve the <b>springback</b> action. However, woodwinds usually oil their keys only every few months, whereas some brass players lubricate their valves several times a week.|$|E
50|$|Pure {{titanium}} {{can exist}} in two phases: Alpha and Beta. Alpha phase represents low temperature (below 885 Â°C) and beta phase represents high temperature (above 885 Â°C). Charles J. Burstone and Dr. Goldberg developed the Î²-Titanium when they combined Molybdenum with pure titanium. They devised this alloy to allow these wires to produce lower biomechanical forces {{compared to the}} stainless steel and cobalt-chromium-nickel wires. They have better formability and <b>springback</b> then the stainless steel wires. Thus this alloy {{came to be known}} as Beta-Titanium alloy. It consists of Titatnium (80%), Molybdenum (11%), Zirconium (7%) and Tin (4%). This alloy is known commercially by the name TMA or Titanium-Molybdenum alloy. This alloy does not involve nickel and can be used in patients who have allergy to nickel. TMA wires have rough surfaces and produce most friction out of all the wires used in orthodontics which was found in a study done by Kusy et al. in 1989.|$|E

40|$|The <b>springback</b> {{phenomenon}} of tube bending occurs consequentially after unloading, which {{will affect the}} manufacturing accuracy and processing efficiency of the tubular products. In this article, the bending and <b>springback</b> processes of minor-diameter thick-walled tube are simulated by ABAQUS to reveal the <b>springback</b> laws. The <b>springback</b> prediction of three-dimensional variable curvature bent tube is projected on each discrete osculating and rectifying plane, and then the three-dimensional problem can be transformed into two dimensions. The mathematic relationship of the radius before and after <b>springback</b> in the plane is built by approximate pure bending <b>springback</b> experiments.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Springback</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{problems}} in sheet metal forming processes. It causes improper fit, which creates serious problems during assembly of the parts. Based on material strength, a considerable amount of elastic recovery during unloading can be observed. In this study, <b>springback</b> behaviour of a hardened 5083 -H 111 aluminium-magnesium (AlâMg) alloy with a thickness of 3 mm using a 60 angle V-shape die bending process at various temperatures ranging from 50 to 300 C was investigated. The effects of temperature on <b>springback</b> behaviour were identified. Results indicate that <b>springback</b> increased with decreasing temperature. The same amount of <b>springback</b> was measured at 0, 25, and 100 C. It was observed that the amount of <b>springback</b> increased between 100 and 200 C and then started to decrease beyond 200 C.

40|$|Finite element {{evaluation}} {{is one of}} the methods in predicting the <b>springback</b> angle in sheet metal bending. Predicting the <b>springback</b> is important since to produce the accuracy part geometry, the design of the die and bending tool must be accurate. This thesis aims to evaluate the reliability of finite element method by comparing the results with experimental results. The effect of parameters such as anisotropy in <b>springback</b> also has been studied. Abaqus software has been used to simulate the bending process and the mechanical properties provided from tensile test will be used to run the simulation. In the U-bending experiment, the die were clamped on stamping machine and the Galvanized Iron sheets then have been bent before the <b>springback</b> being measured with SolidWorks software. The results from the experiment and simulation is slightly different for the <b>springback</b> angle Æ 1, which the simulation shows increasing the orientation will increase the <b>springback,</b> and for the experimental, the <b>springback</b> higher at 0 degree orientation angle, and lower at 45 degree. For the <b>springback</b> angle Æ 2, the simulation and experimental result show that increasing the orientation angle will increase the amount of <b>springback.</b> Finite element method can be used to predict the <b>springback</b> since the results are nearly the same and percentages of error are below 10 %. It can be comprehended that the finite element method are suitable method to predict the <b>springback</b> angle of sheet metal bending. The finite element method is important in the future...|$|E
