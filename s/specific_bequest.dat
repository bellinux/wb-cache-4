2500|$|Stephen Greenblatt {{argues that}} Shakespeare {{probably}} initially loved Hathaway, supporting this {{by referring to}} the theory that a passage {{in one of his}} sonnets (Sonnet 145) plays off Anne Hathaway's name, saying she saved his life (writing [...] "I hate from hate away she threw/And saved my life, saying 'not you.'"). Nevertheless, after only three years of marriage Shakespeare left his family and moved to London. Greenblatt suggests that this may imply that he felt trapped by Hathaway. Other evidence to support this belief is that he and Anne were buried in separate (but adjoining) graves and, as has often been noted, Shakespeare's will makes no <b>specific</b> <b>bequest</b> to his wife aside from [...] "the second best bed with the furniture". This may seem like a slight, but many historians contend that the second best bed was typically the marital bed, while the best bed was reserved for guests. The poem [...] "Anne Hathaway" [...] by Carol Ann Duffy endorses this view of the second best bed, having Anne say: [...] "The bed we loved in was a spinning world of forests, castles, torchlight, clifftops, seas where we would dive for pearls." [...] On the other hand, [...] "In the other bed, the best, our guests dozed on, dribbling their prose". A bed missing from an inventory of Anne's brother's possessions (removed in contravention of their father's will) allows the explanation that the item was an heirloom from the Hathaway family, that had to be returned. The law at the time also stated that the widow of a man was automatically entitled to a third of his estate, so Shakespeare did not need to mention specific bequests in the will.|$|E

50|$|A will {{contract}} {{is a term}} used in the law of wills describing a contract to exchange a current performance for a future bequest. In such an agreement, one party (the promisee) will provide some performance {{in exchange for a}} promise by the other party (the testator, because they must draft a will) to make a <b>specific</b> <b>bequest</b> to the promisee party in the testator's will. Most jurisdictions recognize such contracts as valid, although a few hold them as void against public policy. Some jurisdictions will not recognize an oral contract for such a purpose, requiring instead that the contract be executed in writing and signed by both parties. Some jurisdictions require full compliance with the Statute of Wills to be effective, i.e., in writing and signed in the presence of two witnesses.|$|E
5|$|In {{his last}} will, which he signed January 22, 1868, Pierce left {{a large number}} of <b>specific</b> <b>bequests</b> such as paintings, swords, horses, and other items to friends, family, and neighbors. Much of his $72,000 estate (equal to $ today) went to his brother Henry's family, and to Hawthorne's {{children}} and Pierce's landlady. Henry's son Frank Pierce received the largest share.|$|R

50|$|On 15 May 1651, John Sanderson {{made his}} final will. It {{does not mention}} his wife Cecily, so she had almost {{certainly}} died by that stage. It is evident {{that by the end}} of his life John was a wealthy man; <b>specific</b> <b>bequests</b> included his farm, land and other property at Moulton and over £500 in cash. The will was proved at the Court of Civil Commission on 13 June 1653.|$|R
50|$|Joan (who died {{four days}} after Alphonse) had {{attempted}} to dispose of some of her inherited lands in her will. Joan was the only surviving child and heiress of Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse, Duke of Narbonne, and Marquis of Provence, so under Provençal and French law, the lands {{should have gone to}} her nearest male relative; however, in this case the closest relative was a female, Philippa de Lomagne (daughter of Marie d'Anduze, in turn eldest daughter of Pierre Bermond VI d'Anduze, eldest son of Constance of Toulouse, eldest half-sister of Raymond VII). In her will dated 23 June 1270, Joan declared Philippa as her universal heiress. However, her will was invalidated by the Parlement in 1274. One <b>specific</b> <b>bequest</b> in Alphonse's will, giving his wife's lands in the Comtat Venaissin to the Holy See, was allowed, and it became a Papal territory, a status that it retained until 1791.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{property}} {{lies in a}} [...] "gray" [...] area, {{in which}} the testator's specific intent must be determined. For example, where the testator bequeathes [...] "500 shares of stock" [...] in a company, this may {{be read as a}} general bequest (that the estate should purchase and convey the particular stocks to the beneficiary), or it may be read as a <b>specific</b> <b>bequest,</b> particularly if the testator used a possessive ("my 500 shares"). Such a gift is deemed to be a demonstrative gift. Such demonstrative gifts are deemed to be a hybrid of both specific and general gifts. If one were to bequeath [...] "500 shares of stock," [...] most states would deem that to be a demonstrative gift. The resultant gift to the heir receiving [...] "500 shares," [...] would be the date of death value of 500 shares of that particular stock.|$|E
50|$|Alphonse's death without heirs {{raised some}} {{questions}} as to the succession to his lands. One possibility was that they should revert to the crown, another {{that they should be}} redistributed to his family. The latter was claimed by Charles of Anjou, but in 1283 Parlement decided that the County of Toulouse should revert to the crown, if there were no male heirs. Alphonse's wife Joan (who died four days after Alphonse) had attempted to dispose of some of her inherited lands in her will. Joan was the only surviving child and heiress of Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse, Duke of Narbonne, and Marquis of Provence, so under Provençal and French law, the lands should have gone to her nearest male relative. But, her will was invalidated by Parlement in 1274.

50|$|He {{acquired}} a substantial collection of art, and was generally {{recognized as one}} of the country's foremost art collectors. He left most of his collection, valued at $3 million, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, to pass into the museum's hands after the death of his stepson, Archer. His last will directed that if his stepson should die childless (which he did), Huntington's Fifth Avenue mansion or the proceeds from the sale of the property would go to Yale University. He also made <b>specific</b> <b>bequests</b> totaling $125,000 to Hampton University (then Hampton Institute) and to the Chapin Home for the Aged.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the total}} value of his {{personal}} estate was valued at only £50 13s.6d, his extensive land holdings were [...] "conservatively estimated at £140,000." [...] Except for some <b>specific</b> <b>bequests,</b> his June 12, 1782 will left his entire estate to his daughter Susannah. Susannah Croghan Prevost died in 1790, survived by six of her twelve children. For decades, they pursued their claims to Croghan's often clouded deeds in numerous lawsuits. [...] "For some years, the hopeless involvements of his estate kept courtrooms abuzz, and, when that ceased and his contemporaries died off, the man's name and fame faded away into the obscurity from which he had emerged." ...|$|R

40|$|This study uses a lineal-extinction-probability-minimization {{approach}} {{proposed by}} Chu (1991) {{to study the}} relation between bequest division and population growth. Using a Markov branching process and "first-degree stochastic dominance" technique, our model's results imply that any <b>specific</b> <b>bequest</b> division, primogeniture or equal divisions, does not necessarily increase or reduce the population growth by itself. Whether the population does grow, or by how much, {{will be determined by}} the concurrent social-economic conditions. We find that if all family heads faced an increasing MRTS technology and/or a relatively unfair market chance, then they would tend to choose an unequal division as their optimal bequest policy, and population growth would increase. However, if an equal division was adopted involuntarily by family heads or was enforced by laws, then the population growth might decline.

Approximately {{three years}} before her death in 1960, {{plaintiff}} 2 ̆ 7 s wife created an amendable and revocable inter vivos trust, naming defendant as trustee. The formally drawn instrument provided for pour-over from her simultaneously executed will, however, a <b>specific</b> <b>bequest</b> to the trust was apparently never made. After his wife 2 ̆ 7 s death, plaintiff, choosing to exercise his statutory prerogative of taking against his wife 2 ̆ 7 s will: demanded that defendant trustee pay over to h i from the corpus of the inter vivos trust the one-half share which he claimed was due him under Ohio law. Upon the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s refusal to accede, plaintiff brought an action in the Probate Court of Cuyahoga County asking for a declaratory judgment establishing his right to receive a distributive share from the trust corpus. The court sustained the right of plaintiff to one-half of the fund {{by virtue of his}} election to take against the will...|$|E
50|$|McLean's will {{contained}} an important flaw {{when it was}} originally written. The will dated August 13, 1821 was drafted and was witnessed by Lemuel Shaw. It did not contain a residuary clause {{to dispose of the}} rest of the estate after the <b>specific</b> <b>bequests.</b> This oversight was corrected in a codicil dated September 18, 1822, one year before McLean’s death, leaving everything not specifically disposed of to the Massachusetts General Hospital. The will is transcribed in its entirely at Bator, Thomas E. and Seely, Heidi A., The Boston Trustee: The Lives, Laws & Legacy of a Vital Institution 21 (2015). The Trust established for his wife, Ann, and Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard College was subject to two Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court cases, including the famous Harvard College v.

5000|$|Despite {{these large}} bequests, his home-made will left his sister Ann his land and {{residual}} fortune; she was then 79, and without children or close relations. Clayton's friend Bishop Barrington descended upon her, and after exercising what many later felt was undue influence, persuaded {{her to make}} a new will, in which he was named sole executor, with wide power over the disposition of the funds. Ann died in 1802 and after <b>specific</b> <b>bequests</b> of over £33,000, some £30,000 was left for the executor to spend on [...] "such objects of benevolence and liberality as the trustee in his own discretion shall most approve of" [...] - perhaps equating to £2.1 million in modern terms. The will generated Morice v Bishop of Durham in 1805, an important English trusts law case concerning the beneficiary principle, in which the trust the will purported to create was held to be invalid.|$|R

Most of the $200+ million estate went to two {{charitable}} foundations he formed during his lifetime, the Fairchild Foundation and the Sherman Fairchild Foundation. Bequestees included Walter Burke of Winding Lane, Greenwich, Conn. Mr. Burke, the executor, was a longtime friend and business advisor. Other bequests included were to Ann Diahn Williams of Beverley Hills, California, $2 million, or 1% of the net estate, whichever is greater; Cornelia Lynn Sharpe of 111 East 75th Street, $200,000, and Roswell Gilpatric of 79 East 79th Street, $100,000. <b>Specific</b> <b>bequests</b> to organizations were Roosevelt Hospital, $300,000; the Salvation Army, $200,000 and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, in memory of his late aunt, May Fairchild; $100,000. His will was offered for probate in Manhattan Surrogate's Court by {{the law firm of}} Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamiltion of New York.

After <b>specific</b> <b>bequests</b> to family members and friends, he bequeathed the residue to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. The {{inventory}} of his estate was valued at 1423 pounds, 8 shillings, 8 pence. An additional inventory added another 41 pounds, 10 shillings, 9 pence. The distribution to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel was made in two payments. One was for 62 pounds, 17 shillings, 5 pence. The second was for 43 pounds, 4 shillings, and 10 pence. His will had been written on 4 August 1751 and probated on 26 October 1751. His wife Mary (nee Stanton) wrote her will on 2 October 1761 and was probated on 18 February 1762 in Prince George's County, Maryland. In her will she styled herself as [...] "widow of The Rivirend Mr. Jacob Henderson, late of Prince George's Co. decd."

60|$|There he {{was told}} that the lawyer himself was sole executor, and he--Ralph--residuary legatee. He could not help a feeling of exultation, for he and Eileen were at that time {{particularly}} hard pressed. He restrained it, however, and went to his hotel to write to her. He received a telegram in answer next morning at ten o'clock: 'For goodness' sake leave all details to lawyer, Eileen,' which he thought very peculiar. He lunched with the lawyer after the funeral, and they opened his Aunt's will. It was quite short and simple, made certain <b>specific</b> <b>bequests</b> of lace and jewellery, left a hundred pounds to her executor the lawyer, and the rest of her property to her nephew Ralph Wotchett. The lawyer proposed to advertise for debts in the usual way, and Ralph with considerable control confined himself to urging all speed in the application for Probate, and disposal of the estate. He caught a late train back to Eileen. She received his account distrustfully; she was sure he had put his finger in the pie, and if he had it would all go wrong. Well, if he hadn't, he soon would! It was really as if loyalty had given way in her now that their expectations were on the point of being realised.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} ways in which lay benefactors in the cities of London and York interacted with their local {{religious}} houses through ostensibly pious gifts and what this might indicate about their ideas of law, spiritual belief and practices, and personal piety and charity c. 1150 -c. 1250. The focus is on the cartulary records of four religious institutions. These are the nunnery of St. Mary Clerkenwell and Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate, in London; and St. Mary’s Abbey, and St. Leonard’s Hospital in York. Using the charters copied into the cartularies, the thesis argues that through a close reading of the source material, with a focus on grants made for ostensibly pious purposes, it is possible {{to examine the relationship between}} lay and religious from a nuanced position. Furthermore, research into Angevin London and York, seeks to investigate an earlier time-period that has generally received less attention from historians. The body of the following work is divided informally into an introduction, four chapters and a conclusion. The first chapter is an examination of the purpose and function of the cartularies of religious houses, including a detailed description of the five main sources used. The second chapter discusses the cities of London and York, their citizens and the place (both physically and conceptually) of the religious institutions within them. These are followed by two chapters that seek to develop ideas about lay interaction with religious houses. The charter diplomatic and manipulation of legal patterns in charitable and pious benefactions is the focus of Chapter Three, while Chapter Four draws attention to the <b>specific</b> <b>bequests</b> and requests made by lay donors. What emerges is a visible connection between the donation patterns of the laity and developing legal structures, and ideas of personal piety and charity...|$|R
50|$|When {{the will}} was offered for probate in Massachusetts, there was {{objection}} by the heirs upon the grounds, among others, {{of lack of}} testamentary capacity and undue influence. After a hearing, the probate court granted a motion for the framing of issues for trial before a jury. In that situation, a compromise agreement was entered into between the heirs, the legatees, the devisees, and the executors under the will and the Attorney General of Massachusetts. This agreement provided that the will should be admitted to probate and letters testamentary issued; that the <b>specific</b> and pecuniary <b>bequests</b> to individuals should be enforced; that the bequest of the residuary estate to the Endowment Trust should be disregarded; that $200,000 should {{be paid to the}} heirs, and a like amount to the Endowment Trust, and that the net residue of the estate, as defined, should be equally divided between the trustees of the Endowment Trust and the heirs.|$|R
