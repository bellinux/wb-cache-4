60|$|This {{primitive}} {{method of}} place specification deals only with {{places on the}} surface of rigid bodies, and is dependent on the existence of points on this surface which are distinguishable from each other. But we can free ourselves from both of these limitations without altering the nature of our <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> <b>position.</b> If, for instance, a cloud is hovering over Times Square, then we can determine its position relative {{to the surface of the}} earth by erecting a pole perpendicularly on the Square, so that it reaches the cloud. The length of the pole measured with the standard measuring-rod, combined with the specification of the position of the foot of the pole, supplies us with a complete place specification. On the basis of this illustration, we are able to see the manner in which a refinement of the conception of position has been developed.|$|E

To minimize the H∞ norm of the positioning error {{in the presence of}} model uncertainty, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) synthesis approach for optimal inversion feedforward controller design is presented. The <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> resolution, control width, robustness, and output signal magnitude imposed on the entire 2 DOF control system are taken as optimization objectives of feedback controller design. The robust feedback controller design approach integrates with feedforward controller systematically and is obtained via LMI optimization.

Because of the lack of clinical data and long-term studies, electromagnetic systems have been viewed for a long time as prone to malfunctioning, temperamental and imprecise. With the development of a pulsed DC technique, precision levels can also now be reached that are comparable with those of the already established optical and mechanical measuring procedures. However, It must be noted that the influence on the measuring accuracy within the operating field increases with increasing iron component and magnetizability of the various metals used in the operating theatre (titanium < aluminium < high alloy metals < low allow metals).

40|$|A {{system is}} being {{developed}} to gather kineto-dynamic data for a study to determine the load vectors applied to bone during exercise on equipment {{similar to that used}} in space. This information will quantify bone loading for exercise countermeasures development. Decreased muscle loading and external loading of bone during weightlessness results in cancellous bone loss of 1 percent per month in the lower extremities and 2 percent per month in the calcaneous. It is hypothesized that loading bone appropriately during exercise may prevent the bone loss. The system consists of an ergometer instrumented to provide position of the pedal (foot), pedaling forces on the foot (on the sagittal plane), and force on the seat. Accelerometers attached to the limbs will provide acceleration. These data will be used as input to an analytical model of the limb to determine forces on the bones and on groups of muscles. EMG signals from activity in the muscles will also be used in conjunction with the equations of mechanics of motion to be able to discern forces exerted by specific muscles. The tasks to be carried out include: design of various mechanical components to mount transducers, specification of mechanical components, <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> transducers, development of a scheme to control the data acquisition instruments (TEAC recorder and optical encoder board), development of a dynamic model of the limbs in motion, and development of an overall scheme for data collection analysis and presentation. At the present time, all the hardware components of the system are operational, except for a computer board to gather position data from the pedals and crank. This board, however, may be put to use by anyone with background in computer based instrumentation. The software components are not all done. Software to transfer data recorded from the EMG measurements is operational, software to drive the optical encoder card is mostly done. The equations to model the kinematics and dynamics of motion of the limbs have been developed, but they have not yet been implemented in software. Aside from the development of the hardware and software components of the system, the methodology to use accelerometers and encoders and the formulation of the appropriate equations are an important contribution to the area of biomechanics, particularly in space applications...|$|E

The calculated energy appears too great o allow segregation f Ca and Na atoms into domains upon annealing without a corresponding movement of A 1 and Si from an original disordered structure. The calculated energy may be sufficiently small that Ca and Na atoms can disorder partially without movement of A 1 and Si upon heating a low-plagioclase to high temperatures. VARIOUS models for the structure of intermediate plagiodase have been proposed, ranging from Chao and Taylor's (I 94 O) alternating bands of albite-like and anorthite-like structures to complex models by Megaw (196 o) and Korekawa and Jagodzinski (1967).

Besides patterning their immediate targets, the readouts of opposing small RNA gradients enable <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> robust, uniformly <b>positioned</b> developmental boundaries. These patterning properties of small RNAs are reminiscent of those of animal morphogens.

A detailed Monte Carlo model was developed using the MCNP 4 C code. The simulation {{results indicate that the}} uncertainty due to the dead layer thickness has larger effect on photons energies below 100 keV, where for 15 keV incident photon energy the total counts are by a factor of 7 times higher when the thickness is 50 % larger. Small variations in source position and angular spectrometer have minimum effect on the photon energies modelled. The absence of A 1 -holder in the Monte Carlo model reduces the Compton region information for higher energy regions. This analysis has indicated that Monte Carlo methods can represent a valuable tool for the quantitative uncertainty analysis of radiation spectrometers.
