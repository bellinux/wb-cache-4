5|$|The {{scene in}} which Veronica rebuffs Logan for {{sleeping}} with Madison over winter break {{was the subject of}} a continuing debate in the writers' room about Veronica's character. Specifically, Enbom and Klemmer, two writers for the episode thought that Veronica <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> mistrustful, paranoid and jealous, while executive producers Thomas and Diane Ruggiero advocated for these traits in Veronica. Thomas illustrated their creative differences by stating that he enjoyed the film Chasing Amy, while Enbom did not.|$|E

5|$|Seaborgium is {{the fourth}} member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals and the heaviest member of group 6 in the periodic table, below chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten. All {{the members of the}} group form a diversity of oxoanions. They readily portray their group oxidation state of +6, although this is highly oxidising in the case of chromium, and this state becomes more and more stable to reduction as the group is descended: indeed, tungsten is the last of the 5d transition metals where all four 5d electrons participate in metallic bonding. As such, seaborgium should have +6 as its most stable oxidation state, both in the gas phase and in aqueous solution, and this is the only oxidation state that is experimentally known for it; the +5 and +4 states <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> stable and the +3 state, the most common for chromium, would be the least stable for seaborgium. Experimental chemical investigation has been hampered due to the need to produce seaborgium one atom at a time, its short half-life, and the resulting necessary harshness of the experimental conditions.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} type of {{single-mode}} fiber has a core diameter of 8–10 micrometers and is designed for use in the near infrared. The mode structure depends on the wavelength of the light used, so that this fiber actually supports a small number of additional modes at visible wavelengths. Multi-mode fiber, by comparison, is manufactured with core diameters as small as 50 micrometers and as large as hundreds of micrometers.

25|$|There is {{some debate}} over the best type of guideway. Proposals include beams similar to monorails, bridge-like trusses {{supporting}} internal tracks, and cables embedded in a roadway. Most designs put the vehicle {{on top of the}} track, which reduces visual intrusion and cost as well as easing ground-level installation. An overhead track is necessarily higher, but may also be narrower. Most designs use the guideway to distribute power and data communications, including to the vehicles. The Morgantown PRT failed its cost targets because of its steam-heated track, so most proposals plan to resist snow and ice in ways that <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> expensive. Masdar's system has been limited because it attempted to dedicate ground-level to PRT guideways. This led to unrealistically expensive buildings and roads.|$|E
25|$|Justice Scalia {{argued that}} the Court thought the {{precedent}} established in the Gerstein case in regards to issues associated with warrantless arrests {{was more than enough}} in determining when probable cause is determined for suspects.

Finally, Justice Scalia argued that the Court’s further interpretation of the Gerstein case to mandate that law enforcement must determine probable cause in a set amount of time was unnecessary; he felt that it was completely unrelated to clearing arrest-related administrative affairs or assigning a judge to the suspect’s case. He also felt that the probable cause determination for suspects arrested without a warrant <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> strict.|$|E

For Romanians the immigration violation rate was 2.7% in 2013 and the average 3 year visa refusal rate was 15%.

25|$|In 1927, Charles Elton {{published}} an influential synthesis {{on the use}} of food webs, which resulted in them becoming a central concept in ecology. In 1966, interest in food webs increased after Robert Paine's experimental and descriptive study of intertidal shores, suggesting that food web complexity was key to maintaining species diversity and ecological stability. Many theoretical ecologists, including Sir Robert May and Stuart Pimm, were prompted by this discovery and others to examine the mathematical properties of food webs. According to their analyses, complex food webs <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> stable than simple food webs. The apparent paradox between the complexity of food webs observed in nature and the mathematical fragility of food web models is currently an area of intensive study and debate. The paradox may be due partially to conceptual differences between persistence of a food web and equilibrial stability of a food web.|$|E
25|$|White Portland cement {{or white}} {{ordinary}} Portland cement (WOPC) {{is similar to}} ordinary, grey, Portland cement in all respects, except for its high degree of whiteness. Obtaining this colour requires high purity raw materials (low Fe2O3 content), and some modification to the method of manufacture, a.o. a higher kiln temperature required to sinter the clinker {{in the absence of}} ferric oxides acting as a flux in normal clinker. As Fe2O3 contributes to decrease the melting point of the clinker (normally 1450°C), the white cement requires a higher sintering temperature (around 1600°C). Because of this, it is somewhat more expensive than the grey product. The main requirement is to have a low iron content which <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> than 0.5wt.% expressed as Fe2O3 for white cement, and less than 0.9wt.% for off-white cement. It also helps to have the iron oxide as ferrous oxide (FeO) which is obtained via slightly reducing conditions in the kiln, i.e., operating with zero excess oxygen at the kiln exit. This gives the clinker and cement a green tinge. Other metallic oxides such as Cr2O3 (green), MnO (pink), TiO2 (white), etc., in trace content, can also give colour tinges, so for a given project it is best to use cement from a single batch.|$|E
