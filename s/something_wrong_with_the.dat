5|$|In 1776, Edward Gibbon had {{observed}} {{that there was}} <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> numbers and names of the imperial biographers, and that this had already been recognised by older historians who had written on that subject. A clear example was the referencing of the biographer 'Lampridius' (who was apparently writing his biographies after 324) by 'Vopiscus', who {{was meant to be}} writing his biographies in 305-6. Then in 1889, Hermann Dessau, who had become increasingly concerned by the large number of anachronistic terms, Vulgar Latin vocabulary, and especially the host of obviously false proper names in the work, proposed that the six authors were all fictitious personae, and that the work was in fact composed by a single author in the late 4th century, probably in the reign of Theodosius I. Among his supporting evidence was that the life of Septimius Severus appeared to have made use of a passage from the mid-4th-century historian Aurelius Victor, and that the life of Marcus Aurelius likewise uses material from Eutropius. In the decades following Dessau, many scholars argued to preserve {{at least some of the}} six Scriptores as distinct persons and in favor of the first-hand authenticity for the content. As early as 1890, Mommsen postulated a Theodosian 'editor' of the Scriptores work, an idea that has resurfaced many times since. Hermann Peter (editor of the Augustan History and of the Historicorum Romanorum reliquiae) proposed a date of 330 for when the work was written, based upon an analysis of style and language. Others, such as Norman H. Baynes, abandoned the early 4th century date but only advanced it as far as the reign of Julian the Apostate (useful for arguing the work was intended as pagan propaganda).|$|E

[...] Speaking about the channel, Paul said, [...] "I {{was at a}} debate one time a couple years ago, where I didn't think I got a fair shake. In a two-hour debate, I had 89 seconds. I thought, maybe there's <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> media. Maybe they're not covering us fairly. I'm just {{using it as a}} pun, but there’s a bit of truth to this. We don't get a fair shake. The people who believe in liberty and limited government don't expect it from the ordinary media." [...] Speaking about his youth appeal, he noted, [...] "They don’t sit and watch TV and turn the programs on at seven o'clock to watch us like that – so I thought the technology was there.

I'll smoke a joint or whatever afterwards." [...] Black Sabbath bandmate Tony Iommi said that, while all the band were involved with {{alcohol and other}} drugs to various degrees in the 1970s, Osbourne had the unhealthiest lifestyle of them all. Despite this, said Iommi, he was typically the only one left standing when the others were [...] "out for the count".

2500|$|On {{the return}} leg from Hopen the {{aircraft}} followed a route via Bjørnøya, approaching the island from the northeast. At 14:57 it passed at low altitude {{just west of}} the station, while it retained radio contact. Minutes later the station lost contact with the aircraft, although the operators there simply presumed that the aircraft's radio had stopped workinga common occurrence at the time. The aircraft was flying at an altitude of only [...] above the ground over Bjørnøya. While passing the radio operator on the Catalina had made contact with Bjørnøya Radio. He had attempted to make contact again just before impact, which was thought by the investigation commission to be possibly because the crew had discovered <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> aircraft. This possible problem may have been the cause of the accident. The impact took place [...] south of the station, when the tip of the right wing hit the ground and subsequently the aircraft crashed into the ground in an explosion. The landscape at the accident site is completely flat.|$|E
2500|$|Wait periods for organ transplants in China are {{significantly}} shorter than {{elsewhere in the}} world. According to a 2006 post on the China International Transplantation Assistance Center website, [...] "it may take only one month to receive a liver transplantation, the maximum waiting time being two months. As for the kidney transplantation, it may take one week to find a suitable donor, the maximum time being one month...If <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> donor's organ happens, the patient will {{have the option to}} be offered another organ donor and have the operation again in one week." [...] Other organ transplant centers similarly advertised average wait times of one or two weeks for liver and kidney transplants. This is consistent with accounts of organ transplant recipients, who report receiving organs a matter of days or weeks. By comparison, median wait times for a kidney in developed countries such as the United States, Canada and Great Britain typically range from two years to over four years, despite the fact that these countries have millions of registered organ donors and established systems of organ matching and allocation.|$|E
