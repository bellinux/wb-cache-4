5|$|The {{question}} however has to {{be considered}} {{on the basis of}} the fact that, for reasons which are readily understandable, he with the express approval of His Majesty enjoys this title and has been referred to as a Royal Highness on a formal occasion and in formal documents. In the light of precedent it <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> that the wife of a Royal Highness enjoys the same title unless some appropriate express step can be and is taken to deprive her of it.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{probably}} also campaigned in Thrace in late 352 BC, possibly {{after returning to}} Macedon from Thessaly. At this point, if not before, Philip defeated Amadokos and subjugated him, and possibly also expelled Cetriporis from his client kingship. During the campaign, Philip's army reached deep into Kersebleptes' territory and laid siege to the fortress of Heraion Teichos located somewhere near Perinthos, {{on the coast of}} the Propontis (although Buckler places this siege in 353 BC). On learning of the siege, the Athenians voted to dispatch 40 triremes to oppose Philip. However, they then heard that Philip had died (or had been taken ill), so the relief mission never actually sailed. It <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> that Philip did fall ill during the campaign, but exactly how the campaign ended is unclear. It was probably at this time that Philip took Kersebleptes' son as a hostage to Pella, effectively ending Kersebleptes' freedom of action.|$|E

5|$|The Mise of Lewes {{was signed}} {{on the day}} of Montfort's victory at the Battle of Lewes, though it is not known whether it {{happened}} during or after the battle. Neither are the terms of the document known, though it <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> that they involved conditions for further negotiations. These efforts at a permanent settlement fell through, however, and the support for Montfort's government gradually eroded. Henry's oldest son, Edward – the later King Edward Istarted a military campaign that ended in the Battle of Evesham in August 1265, where Earl Simon was defeated and killed. Parts of the baronial resistance still held out, {{but by the end of}} 1266 the final besieged garrison at Kenilworth Castle surrendered. The rebels were given pardons according to terms set out in the Dictum of Kenilworth.|$|E
5|$|Troglita did {{not remain}} inactive: from Carthage, the praetorian prefect Athanasius and Troglita's young son {{organized}} reinforcements and {{supplies for the}} camp at Laribus, while Troglita himself succeeded not only in reconciling Cutzinas and Isfidaias, but also in gaining the allegiance of King Iaudas and his tribe. In the spring of 548, Troglita, having regrouped his forces, met with his Moorish allies at the plain of Arsuris on the northern limits of Byzacena. Corippus gives extraordinary numbers for the native contingents provided by each chief: 30,000 for Cutzinas, 100,000 for Isfidaias, and 12,000 under Iaudas's brother. Whatever the real numbers, it <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> that Troglita's regular troops formed the lesser portion of the imperial army.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{the exact}} date Saint Padarn founded {{the church is}} uncertain, it <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> however that Llanbadarn Fawr was an early sixth-century foundation, a Celtic clas church. The church {{may have been the}} seat of an abbot or bishop during the years {{immediately}} following Saint Padarn, who was traditionally said to be its first bishop (as a clas church, it was not a cathedral as we understand the term today, but closer to a collegiate church), nor did it necessarily possess any substantial buildings. It was one of the leading clasau of early Christian Wales, and the one we know most about, partly because of the significant role it played as a literary centre.|$|E

5|$|Anne was the {{daughter}} of Thomas Boleyn, later Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Howard, daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk. Thomas Boleyn was a well respected diplomat with a gift for languages; he was also a favourite of King Henry VII, who sent him on many diplomatic missions abroad. Anne and her siblings grew up at Hever Castle in Kent. However, the siblings were born in Norfolk at the Boleyn home at Blickling. A lack of parish records from the period has made it impossible to establish Anne's date of birth. Contemporary evidence is contradictory, with several dates having been put forward by various historians. An Italian, writing in 1600, suggested that she had been born in 1499, while Sir Thomas More's son-in-law, William Roper, indicated a much later date of 1512. Her birth was most likely sometime between 1501 and 1507. As with Anne herself, it is uncertain when her two siblings were born, but it <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> that her sister Mary was older than Anne. Mary's children clearly believed their mother had been the elder sister. Most historians now agree that Mary was born in 1499. Mary's grandson claimed the Ormonde title in 1596 on the basis she was the elder daughter, which Elizabeth I accepted. Their brother George was born around 1504.|$|E
5|$|Thermopylae {{is arguably}} the most famous battle in European ancient history, {{repeatedly}} referenced in ancient, recent, and contemporary culture. In Western culture at least, it is the Greeks who are lauded for their performance in battle. However, {{within the context of the}} Persian invasion, Thermopylae was undoubtedly a defeat for the Greeks. It <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> that the Greek strategy was to hold off the Persians at Thermopylae and Artemisium; whatever they may have intended, it was presumably not their desire to surrender all of Boeotia and Attica to the Persians. The Greek position at Thermopylae, despite being massively outnumbered, was nearly impregnable. If the position had been held for even a little longer, the Persians might have had to retreat for lack of food and water. Thus, despite the heavy losses, forcing the pass was strategically a Persian victory, but the successful retreat of the bulk of the Greek troops was in its own sense a victory as well. The battle itself had showed what a few free men, willing to do anything for victory against the invaders, could accomplish, and the defeat at Thermopylae had turned Leonidas and the men under his command into martyrs. That boosted the morale of all Greek soldiers in the second Persian invasion.|$|E

50|$|The {{remains of}} a theatre {{belonging}} to the Roman period were discovered in 1883. The ruins of an ancient building called the Naviglio, the nature of which does not <b>seem</b> <b>clear,</b> are described (ib. 1884, p. 252).|$|R
25|$|His tomb {{was robbed}} {{at least twice}} in antiquity, but based on the items taken (including {{perishable}} oils and perfumes) and the evidence of restoration of the tomb after the intrusions, it <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> that these robberies took place within several months at most of the initial burial.|$|E
25|$|Some {{areas that}} appear normal under normal MRI look {{abnormal}} under special MRI, like magnetisation transfer MTR-MRI. These are called Normal Appearing White Matter (NAWM) and Normal Appearing Grey Matter (NAGM). The cause why the normal appearing areas {{appear in the}} brain is unknown, but <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> that they appear mainly in the ventricles and that they predict {{the course of the}} disease.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{conquest of}} the San Francisco Bay area came later than to Southern California. San Francisco's {{characteristic}} foggy weather and geography led early European explorers such as Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo to bypass the Golden Gate and miss entering San Francisco Bay, although it <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> from historical accounts of navigation that they passed close to the coastline {{north and south of}} the Golden Gate.|$|E
50|$|After an {{election}} held under American supervision, preliminary returns gave the opposition 20 {{seats in the}} Assembly to the government’s 13. The way thus <b>seemed</b> <b>clear</b> for an opposition candidate to be selected as president, most likely Ricardo Arias Feraud.|$|R

25|$|In summer 1837, Chebyshev {{passed the}} {{registration}} examinations and, in September of that year, began his mathematical {{studies at the}} second philosophical department of Moscow University. His teachers included N.D. Brashman, N.E. Zernov and D.M. Perevoshchikov of whom it <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> that Brashman had the greatest influence on Chebyshev. Brashman instructed him in practical mechanics and probably showed him the work of French engineer J.V. Poncelet.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} Agnes Greys renewed {{interest}} in poetry is, however, the curate to whom she is attracted. William Weightman aroused much curiosity. It <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> he was a good-looking, engaging young man, whose easy humour and kindness towards the sisters made a considerable impression. It is such a character that she portrays in Edward Weston, and that her heroine Agnes Grey finds deeply appealing.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the actual}} source Shakespeare used {{has not yet}} been determined, it <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> that Shakespeare's Ariel and his {{relationship}} with Prospero reflects more closely the Renaissance idea of a neutral spirit under the control of a magician than the religious idea of a sprite. Shakespeare, however, refuses to make Ariel a will-less character, infusing him with desires and near-human feelings uncharacteristic of most sprites of this type.|$|E

25|$|Many {{scholars}} {{think these}} numbers are exaggerated (records are inadequate, they are much larger than those from similar societies, soldiers were paid {{by the number of}} enemies they killed and the Han dynasty had an interest in exaggerating the bloodiness of the age before China was unified). Regardless of exaggeration, it <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> that warfare had become excessive during this period. The bloodshed and misery of the Warring States period goes a long way in explaining China's traditional preference for a united throne.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of whether or not salsa is anything more than Cuban music has been argued over for more than thirty years. Initially, not much difference could be seen. Later it became clear that not only was New York salsa different from popular music in Cuba, but salsa in Venezuela, Colombia and other countries could also be distinguished. It also <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> that salsa has receded from the great position it achieved in the late 1970s. The reasons for this are also much disputed.|$|E
25|$|The {{globalization}} movement isn't anti-Semitic, it just hasn't fully {{confronted the}} implications of diving into the Middle East conflict. Most {{people on the left}} are simply choosing sides. In the Middle East, where one side is under occupation and the other has the U.S. military behind it, the choice <b>seems</b> <b>clear.</b> But it is possible to criticize Israel while forcefully condemning the rise of anti-Semitism. And it is equally possible to be pro-Palestinian independence without adopting a simplistic pro-Palestinian/anti-Israel dichotomy, a mirror image of the good-versus-evil equations so beloved by President George W. Bush.|$|E
