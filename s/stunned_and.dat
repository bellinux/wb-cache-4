5|$|Following the explosions, the Allied advance was {{virtually}} unopposed as the Germans were too <b>stunned</b> <b>and</b> demoralised {{to put up}} much resistance. However, not everything went the Australians' way. The 3rd Division, under Major General John Monash, suffered heavy casualties when they were shelled by phosgene gas and shrapnel shells while moving towards the line of departure, nevertheless the division still managed to get into position {{for the start of}} the attack. Strong German counterattacks were launched the next day, once again supported by concentrated artillery fire; however, the advance was able to continue on through the mess of concrete blockhouses the Germans had erected and continued on until all the objectives had been taken. Australian casualties amounted to nearly 6,800 men. On 2 July 1917, Major General Holmes was mortally wounded by a German shellburst while surveying the Messines battlefield with the Premier of New South Wales, William Holman.|$|E
5|$|In the B story, April (Aubrey Plaza) {{is working}} as Chris' (Rob Lowe) {{assistant}} until {{he goes back}} to Indianapolis.

In an attempt to get fired, April purposely neglects to tell Ann (Rashida Jones) that Chris cannot make a lunch date. When Ann arrives to confront Chris, she quickly realizes April's ploy. Ann reveals she is very happy dating Chris, and would even probably move with him to Indianapolis if asked. Andy (Chris Pratt), who is still trying to win back April's affections, gives Chris an obviously forged letter from the FBI claiming April must immediately return to the parks department. Chris sees through the ruse and tells April she can go back, but that remaining his assistant may provide her career opportunities.

50|$|This weave of Spirit and Fire. as {{demonstrated}} by Osan'gar at Chapter 41 of A Crown of Swords, is very painful and {{it is used to}} <b>stun</b> <b>and</b> to paralyze. Another weave is of Spirit, Air, Water, and a touch of Fire used by the Red Ajah, to <b>stun</b> <b>and</b> capture male channelers. Because male channelers are usually stronger than female channelers, an Aes Sedai alone would normally not be capable of maintaining a Shield over a male channeler, posing a possible danger when hunting for False Dragons or maddened male channelers. This is overcome by Stunning them to be Shielded later by a circle of six for transport to the Tower and gentling.|$|R

25|$|On {{the evening}} of Saturday, May 5, Mayweather {{defeated}} Cotto in 12 rounds by a unanimous decision, improving his record to 43–0. Mayweather used movement and outboxed Cotto {{in the middle of}} the ring for the first few rounds. Beginning in rounds three and four Cotto cut the ring off from Mayweather, forcing the latter to fight from the ropes. However, Mayweather seemed to outfight Cotto from the ropes with his combinations and by rolling with most of Cotto's punches. Cotto had more success in the middle rounds, landing his jab and body shots on Mayweather and effectively trapping him on the ropes. The later rounds were controlled by Mayweather, who boxed more in the center of the ring late in the fight. In the 12th round Mayweather's uppercut <b>stunned</b> <b>and</b> hurt Cotto, but Cotto was able to fight until the end. The judges scored the fight a unanimous decision for Mayweather by scores of 118–110, 117–111, and 117–111. After the fight, Mayweather said Cotto was the toughest fighter he ever faced.|$|E
25|$|Day Two (13 March): Australia {{found the}} {{inspiration}} {{they needed to}} get back into the match via their great fast bowler, Dennis Lillee. He took the wicket of Mike Brearley straight away, and within half an hour, England had crumbled to 5 for 40. Tony Greig mounted a very brief counterattack, hitting three fours, but he succumbed for 18 (the top score of the innings) and the crowd were <b>stunned</b> <b>and</b> elated when England finished with 95 off 34.3 overs. Lillee dominated proceedings, capturing a personal best of 6 for 26, ably supported by the medium pace of Max Walker, whose four wickets destroyed the middle order. With three and a half hours to go, to be followed by three full days of play, Australia needed not only a big score, but a long innings to allow the wicket to wear and make life difficult for England chasing a big target. Australia promoted spin bowler Kerry O'Keefe to open the batting in place of McCosker and he did a good job, lasting until the new ball lost its shine. But England struck a decisive blow after O'Keefe departed, removing the Australian dangerman Chappell for two and Cosier for four, leaving Australia 3 for 53. Opener Ian Davis was still at the crease and he combined with veteran Doug Walters to add a half century partnership in the time remaining before stumps, leaving the match evenly poised.|$|E
