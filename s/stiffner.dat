40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} improve the dynamic {{behaviour}} of an existing or already designed structure, local modifications can be performed {{by taking advantage of}} the relative displacement between two points of the structure. A <b>stiffner,</b> damper or viscoelastic rod may be added and its effect on the initial structure must be assessed. A new formulation is developed, based on the response of the initial structure at the attachment points of the local modification. A determinantal equation results, whose roots are the eigenvalues of the modified structure. The equation is solved numerically with a dedicated algorithm and it is shown that this is faster than performing an eigenvalue problem reanalysis. The method is able to deal with both undamped and damped systems, and can handle several modifications simultaneously. It is applied on the last stage of a space launcher, along with a double modal synthesis method...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 54) A panel zone of a {{beam-to-column connection}} was analyzed, {{and it was}} observed that unless the column flange is extremely thick, flange <b>stiffners</b> must be added to the column in line with the beam flanges. Such <b>stiffners</b> keep the column flanges from deflecting and prevent stress concentrations in the column flanges and web and in the weld which joins them to the beam. It was also observed that web doubler plates must be added to the panel zone(column web) in order to increase the shear capacity and to prevent excessive panel zone distortion. Three finite element models were constructed using beam and plate elements. The most complete model was composed of 507 nodes and 534 plate elements. Results of the analysis are presented, discussed and comparisons are made for the most complete model (no. 3), with and without <b>stiffners</b> and doubler plates...|$|R

The FEM analysis {{has been carried out}} with various alternatives. The results illuminate the new creative ways for optimum frame design which makes it more sustainable for structural concerns. This paper analyzed the backbone frame for both dynamic and static load condition with the stress deflection bending moment on the tatra chassis frame. The finite element analysis over ansys is performed by considering the load cases and boundary conditions for the stress analysis of the chassis. The tatra chassis is being modeled in catia v 5 and then it is being imported in the finite element analysis software-Ansys. At present the payload of the tatra is 10. 4 tones in this project we enhance the capacity of vehicle to 14 tones from existing chassis as per the requirement.

40|$|Background: Colorectal adenomas are the {{precursor}} lesions of colorectal carcinoma {{and may be}} easily overlooked during colonoscopy, leading to miss rates of up to 26 %. Important colonoscopy quality indicators are the adenoma detection rate (ADR), i. e. the percentage of colonoscopies in which at least one adenoma is sent for pathology and {{the mean number of}} adenomatous polyps per colonoscopy (MAP). There are limited data on the relationship between variations in colonoscopy technique and these important quality indicators. Objective: To investigate the relationship between variation in colonoscopy technique and adenoma/advanced lesion detection. Design: A single-center prospective study. Setting: A non-academic teaching hospital. Patients: Patients who were routinely referred and accepted for either a diagnostic or screening colonoscopy. Main outcome measurements: Mean number of adenomatous polyps per colonoscopy (MAP) and mean number of advanced lesions per colonoscopy (MAL). Results: The MAP per endoscopist ranged from 0. 17 to 0. 65 (p = 0. 219) and the MAL from 0. 08 to 0. 19 (p = 0. 698). Indicators for a difficult introduction; use of the <b>stiffner,</b> the existence of a double-handed period, use of abdominal compressions, percentage of colonoscope looping, number of dynamic position changes, mean introduction time, patient pain score and adjustment of midazolam and phentanyl dose were significantly different between the endoscopists (p-values < 0. 005). The correlations between abdominal distension during withdrawal and MAP and between mean removal time per adenoma per endoscopist and MAP were significant. The correlations between indicators for a difficult introduction and MAP and MAL were not significant. Limitations: Single-center study on colonoscopies performed by only 10 endoscopists. Conclusion: Despite the differences in colonoscopy technique during introduction between endoscopists, {{there were no significant differences}} in the colonoscopy quality indicators MAP and MAL. Nonetheless, there were significant differences in patient pain score. Patient pain score could be regarded as another important quality indicator for colonoscopy. Factors associated with MAP during withdrawal, given sufficient withdrawal times, were the distention of the bowel during inspection, and the skill to remove polyps quickly. ...|$|E

When a rectangular box structure is subjected to certain pressure, stress analysis of rectangular box is necessary to avoid the failure during working condition. In this work, it is proposed to evaluate the stresses in rectangular box by changing L/B ratios 1, 1. 5, 2 for different thicknes of 2. 5, 5, 7. 5 mm & varying fillet radius, using finite element method. To validate finite element stresses, it is necessary to compare these stresses with analytical approach. From the FE analysis of rectangular box, it is seen that cubical box having the lesser stresses & better for stress distribution due to symmetry.

40|$|Inspired by bat wings which exhibit {{compliant}} response {{at lower}} stretch level {{to expand and}} a drastic stiffness change at higher stretch level to enable flapping. The bat-wing skin is highly anisotropic. The skin is more stretchable on spanwise direction and its stiffness becomes more than two orders of magnitude higher after stretched on chordwise direction. On the other hand, the skin on chordwise direction itself is less stretchable and with one order of magnitude of stiffness increase. A new composite dielectric elastomer actuator is developed to mimic such complex mechanical response of the bat through sets of variable stiffness reinforcement ligaments. The composite actuator is capable of initial large predetermined stretch, then exhibiting {{an order of magnitude}} increase in the actuator structural stiffness. The <b>stiffners</b> dimensions and geometric layout controls both the initial stretch and the final actuator stiffness. Details of the design, fabrication, and structural performance will be given in this study. Design domain limitations will also be explored...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} are {{developped}} four numerical models of structural optimization to laminate composite materials made of polymeric matrices. The development models {{can be divided}} into two main groups according to a deterministic or probabilistic failure analysis. The common characteristics of these models are: i) the global optimization problem decomposition in sequential optimization subproblems, ii) multilevel techniques are used, iii) sensitivity analysis, Optimality Criteria and Mathemathical Programming are employed, IV) series expantion of the objective and the constraint functions are performed and taken the second order approximation, V) it is performed a set active strategy in the choice of the constraints. The global objective is the weight minimization of the structures as a cost function subjected to constraints related to structural safety or service conditions. The first two models are deterministics and consider multilevel optimization algorithms of laminate composites using a bilevel decomposition strategy. The objectives at each level are the unconstrained efficiency maximization of the structures related with the anisotropic properties and the weight minimization subjected to stress, strain, displacement and side constraints. These two models are applied to two structural systems: i) shells with moderate thickness where the design variables are the ply angles and the thicknesses of the laminates; ii) plates or shallow shells with <b>stiffners,</b> where the design variables are the ply angles and ply thicknesses of the plate element, and the dimensions of the cross sections of the beems used as <b>stiffners.</b> Uncertainties on the deviations of the physical properties led to a probabilistic failure analysis of the composite materials. On the third optimization model presented in this thesis, based on a weak formulation as First Ply Failure theory, it is defined the limit state function concept to obtain a generalization of the service limit state. Considering the probabilistic nature of the limit state functions and the failure probability concepts, the structural system reliability is defined and the Lind-Hasofer method used to evaluate the reliability [...] Available from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|Hybrid fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) -concrete-steel double-skin tubular columns (DSTCs) {{consist of}} an outer tube made of FRP and an inner tube made of steel, {{with the space}} between filled with concrete. Extensive {{research}} has been conducted on hybrid DSTCs, and has demonstrated their excellent structural performance. In hybrid DSTCs, the outward buckling of the steel inner tube is constrained by the surrounding concrete and the outer FRP tube, but its inward buckling is still possible. Existing research has shown that such inward buckling generally does not {{have a significant effect on}} the column behavior, but it can become significant in non-circular hybrid DSTCs, in hybrid DSTCs with a strong FRP tube, and/or in hybrid DSTCs with a thin steel tube. In such cases, the stiffening of the inner steel tube may be necessary to prevent or delay its inward buckling and to minimize the consequent negative effects on the column behavior. Against this background, this paper presents an experimental study in which square hybrid DSTCs with a rib-stiffened steel inner tube were tested under axial compression. Results from a total of six specimens are presented, with the test variable being the number of ribs on the steel tube. The test results confirmed the effectiveness of providing additional rib <b>stiffners</b> on the steel tube and suggested that the use of a larger number of thin ribs is more effective than that of a smaller number of thick ribs with the same amount of rib material...|$|R
40|$|Owing to the {{construction}} of the new dam on the river Ain. the water of the river level has risen considerably above the earlier level of flow at the suspension bridge in the neighbourhood of Serrieres sur Ain. Hence it became necessary to substitute this structure by a more modern one, suitable to present day traffic demands. This paper summarises the main features of this new bridge. The new bridge spans the river by means of a reinforced concrete arch of 120 m span. The arch is circular, and the deck rests on a palissade supported by the arch. The maximum rise is 30 ms at the crown. The deck carries a roadway 7 ms wide and two sidewalks of 1 m width each, for pedestrians. The deck is supported by by four longitudinal beams, and the arch has a box section and 4 longitudinal <b>stiffners.</b> In the crown zone the <b>stiffners,</b> the deck and the cylindrical surfaces become integrated and enclose three hollow chambers. This structure has great stiffness. The depth of the arch is constant, except at the crown, and is 2. 40 ms. This depth gives the arch a pleasing and slender aspect. The palissade consist of four rows of columns, of 0. 80 x 0. 20 ms section, at intervals of 12. 50 ms. The radius of the arch is 78. 80 ms, and its transversal box section has a total width of 8. 60 ms. The thickness of the inner cylindrical surface is 0. 20 ms. The springers consist of two large reinforced concrete blocks, of approximately 10 ms length and 4. 70 ms height. The construction of the bridge was done {{with the aid of a}} Blondin cable, of 5 tns capacity, spanning 290 ms. The main constructional aid was a. wooden scaffolding, cantilevered from the sides, consisting of 10 trusses. The timber elements were nailed and bolted together. The top part of the framework supports a formwork, made with a double layer of boards, 27 mm in thickness, crossing each other at 45 °. The scaffolding was erected in successive phases and a number of guy cables were employed to stabilise the structure against the deforming effect of the wind. Como consecuencia de la construcción del nuevo embalse sobre el río Ain, las aguas de éste se han elevado considerablemente sobre los niveles asignados a la cota media de desagüe del puente suspendido existente en las inmediaciones de Serrières-sur-Ain.

40|$|The {{problems}} related to damage detection represents a primary concern, particularly {{in the framework of}} composite structure. In fact, for this kind of structures barely visible damage can occur. Moreover, one of the major in-service damage of composite aircraft strcutures is represented by disbonds between the stiffeners and the skin undergoing dynamic or post-buckling loads. The effective implementation of a SHM system relies on the synthesis of non-destructive technique (NDT), fracture mechanics, sensors technology, data manipulation and signal processing, and it can receive a great improvement through the use of an Artificial Neural Networks. Different architectures of Artificial Neural Networks for a structural damage detection are studied in order to detect damage without any prior knowledge of the model of the structure so as to serve as a real-time data processor for SHM systems. The standard feed-forward Multi Layer Perceptron and the Radial Basis Function ANNs are compared. In the former paradigm each neuron is arranged in a series of layer. There are no precise rules for the choose of the number of hidden neurons, only empirical indications. Three training algorithms are considered: the Levenberg-Marquardt, the Conjugate Gradient backpropagation and the Gradient Descent with momentum. Moreover different complexity of the network are considered, by varying the number of hidden neurons. On the other hand, the RBF can require more neurons than standard MLP networks but they can be often designed to reduce the training time with respect to MLP. Two types of RBF are trained. The first can produce a network with zero error on training vectors but the number of hidden neurons is very high since it must be equal to the number of input vectors. So a second type of RBF is created by adding one neuron at each training input, until the sum-squared error falls beneath an error goal or a maximum number of neurons is reached. For the second type of ANNs instead, assumed that the number of hidden neurons is fixed due to the number of training data used to build and train all networks, a parametric analysis is made by changing the spread parameter. A drop-ply delaminated structure employed to represent a bidimensional simplification of the adhesive joints between composite aircraft fuselage skins and <b>stiffners</b> is here analyzed to study the sensing capability of the SHM system proposed. The analyzed configuration consists of an host delaminated structure, made up by 0 ° and 90 ° graphite-epoxy (GE) plies and of a piezoelectric patch, employed to arrange the sensing device. The skin is arranged with unidirectional graphite-expoxy plies. The drop-ply assembly deforms under plane strain conditions and it is clamped at the flange root. The structure undergoes several treansverse shear loads per unit length F acting on the free-edge of the skin. Moreover, for dynamic analyses the load is modeled as a step load to simulate the sudden raise of the shearing postbuckling action. Lastly, a delamination of length a is assumed to occur at the skin-flange 0 °/ 90 ° interfaces. The piezoelectric patch is assumed to be bonded on the flange top surface. The training data are obtained, in term of a Damage Index ID distribution, from a Dual Reciprocity Boundary Element Method transient analysis of the host damaged structure and the bonded piezoelectric sensor. The BEM model allows to compute the electrical signals that are used to define the ID generated by an array of piezoelectric sensors bonded on a delaminated composite skin-stiffner. Thirty-two delamination length and twenty-one load cases are analyzed. It has been observed that the RBF NN tipically requires larger number of training patterns and also a larger network architecture to achieve the same lavel of desired accuracy as the MLP. On the other hand, an advantage of using RBF NNs is that they require a training time inferior than the MLP N...|$|R
