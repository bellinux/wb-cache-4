However, during the anarchy of Stephen various Welsh princes were able to occupy lands beyond it, including Whittington, Shropshire (see Whittington Castle) and Maelor Saesneg, hitherto in England. These lands were brought under English lordship by Henry II of England, but became Marcher lordships, and <b>so</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Wales.

500|$|The episode also {{explores the}} idea that Reyes made a deal that {{involved}} becoming the Ghost Rider, {{and now he has}} [...] "this thing in" [...] him that wants to murder people which Reyes is [...] "ambivalent" [...] about. Bell said that this is the main aspect of their version that grounds him in [...] "a sadness ... and a weight", particularly when interacting with his brother Gabe. In terms of the season's overarching plot, Bell said it was important to tell Reyes' origin story in the episode, rather than earlier or later, because it also reveals the [...] "truth about Eli, and they're very connected." [...] He also drew comparison to the Marvel Netflix television series which often wait to tell the origin story of their heroes later in the season, using flashbacks, saying, [...] "It kind of helps {{to know more about the}} character, and be emotionally invested in the character, before you then go back and show what turned them into this person. And <b>so</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> it was that if you just began with a guy and showed the origin right away, I don't know if it would have been as compelling, I don't know if it would have been as emotional as I think it is. Bell noted that the series always shows Reyes' transformations into Ghost Rider as painful, but when that is shown happening for the first time in this episode [...] "he screams in pain like a lunatic".|$|E

2500|$|I {{was with}} her when she died. She left this world {{literally}} screaming {{at the top of her}} lungs. I {{was with her}} constantly, she lived not even 3 miles from my house, we were together practically every day. She was home for the last few weeks when the doctor told us there was nothing they could do any more. Up until the last two days, she was still moving around. The doctor told us she will leave very quickly and her body will just start to shut down. But when she left, she left the world with a bang, she left it how she lived it. She screamed her way out of here, literally. I truly believe her survival instincts were <b>so</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> her DNA that she was not going to go quietly or willingly.

The joy in writing the show was that everyone was behind it and wanted to do it. And I love her. <b>So</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the joy and excitement and happiness would have gone out of me if she had not been on board 100 percent. I wasn't able to say this at the time, but in retrospect it was a blessing for it to end at a time when we all enjoyed doing it. That's not to say that if the network had ordered more shows that I wouldn't have given it my best. But there was a rightness in how short the season was. This was a show about adolescence and sort of ended in its own adolescence. There was an aura about how short the series was like all things that die young. The show ended at a point that it was still all potential." ...|$|E

2500|$|The rampaging Viking army on the {{continent}} encouraged Alfred to protect his Kingdom of Wessex. He built a navy, reorganised the army, {{and set up a}} system of fortified towns known as burhs. He mainly used old Roman cities for his burhs, as he was able to rebuild and reinforce their existing fortifications. Historically, every freeman in the land could be called out to protect the realm in times of trouble. However, the speed of Viking hit-and-run raids had been too quick for the local militias to act, <b>so</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Alfred's reforms were to create a standing army that could react rapidly to attacks. The Anglo-Saxon rural population lived within a 24km (15-mile) radius of each burh, so they were able to seek refuge when necessary. To maintain the burhs, as well as the standing army, Alfred set up a system of taxation and conscription that is recorded in a document now known as the Burghal Hidage. The burhs were interconnected with a network of military roads, [...] known as herepaths, enabling Alfred's troops to move swiftly to engage the enemy. [...] Some historians believe that each burh [...] would have had a mounted force that would be ready for action against the Vikings.|$|E

6000|$|V. While, therefore, {{it is not}} to be {{supposed}} that mere size will ennoble a mean design, yet every increase of magnitude will bestow upon it a certain degree of nobleness: so that it is well to determine at first, whether the building is to be markedly beautiful or markedly sublime; and if the latter, not to be withheld by respect to smaller parts from reaching largeness of scale; provided only, that it be evidently in the architect's power to reach at least that degree of magnitude which is the lowest at which sublimity begins, rudely definable as that which will make a living figure look less than life beside it. It is the misfortune of most of our modern buildings that we would fain have an universal excellence in them; and <b>so</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the funds must go in painting, part in gilding, part in fitting up, part in painted windows, part in small steeples, part in ornaments here and there; and neither the windows, nor the steeple, nor the ornaments, are worth their materials. For there is a crust about the impressible part of men's minds, which must be pierced through before they can be touched to the quick; and though we may prick at it and scratch it in a thousand separate places, we might as well have let it alone if we do not come through somewhere with a deep thrust: and if we can give such a thrust anywhere, there is no need of another; it need not be even so [...] "wide as a church door," [...] so that it be enough. And mere weight will do this; it is a clumsy way of doing it, but an effectual one, too; and the apathy which cannot be pierced through by a small steeple, nor shone through by a small window, can be broken through in a moment by the mere weight of a great wall. Let, therefore, the architect who has not large resources, choose his point of attack first, and, if he choose size, let him abandon decoration; for, unless they are concentrated, and numerous enough to make their concentration conspicuous, all his ornaments together would not be worth one huge stone. And the choice must be a decided one, without compromise. It must be no question whether his capitals would not look better with a little carving--let him leave them huge as blocks; or whether his arches should not have richer architraves--let him throw them a foot higher, if he can; a yard more across the nave will be worth more to him than a tesselated pavement; and another fathom of outer wall, than an army of pinnacles. The limitation of size must be only in the uses of the building, or in the ground at his disposal.|$|E
