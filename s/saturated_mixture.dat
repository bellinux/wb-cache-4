40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} a {{macroscopic}} model of tumor cord growth is developed, {{relying on the}} mathematical theory of deformable porous media. Tumor is modeled as a <b>saturated</b> <b>mixture</b> of proliferating cells, extracellular fluid and extracellular matrix, that occupies a spatial region close to a blood vessel whence cells get the nutrient needed for their vital functions. Growth of tumor cells takes place within a healthy host tissue, which is in turn modeled as a <b>saturated</b> <b>mixture</b> of non-proliferating cells. Interactions between these two regions are accounted for as an essential mechanism {{for the growth of}} the tumor mass. By weakening the role of the extracellular matrix, which is regarded as a rigid non-remodeling scaffold, a system of two partial differential equations is derived, describing the evolution of the cell volume ratio coupled to the dynamics of the nutrient, whose higher and lower concentration levels determine proliferation or death of tumor cells, respectively. Numerical simulations of a reference two-dimensional problem are shown and commented, and a qualitative mathematical analysis of some of its key issues is proposed. 1...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCoupled {{gas flow}} and solid {{deformation}} processes in porous media have received considerable attention {{because of its}} importance in CBM exploitation and gas outbursts during coal mining. Coalbed methane is mainly adsorbed on coal. The dependence of gas adsorption on gas pressure has {{significant effect on the}} mechanical properties of coal, however, the effect was ignored in most of the previous modeling studies. Based on Truesdell’s postulate of the theory of mixtures, a new set of constitutive equations for the <b>saturated</b> <b>mixtures</b> of gas-filled coal which is composed of coal matrix, adsorbed gas and free gas is developed. Adsorbed gas pressure and the volume fraction of each component of the <b>saturated</b> <b>mixtures</b> are also presented. The proposed constitutive equations show that mechanical response of coal is determined by stress condition, mechanical properties of solid phase, gas pressure, gas adsorption, pore structure and its evolution.

Body burden {{analysis was used}} to analyze the intrinsic {{toxicity of}} the six hydrocarbon mixtures. The major fractions of the whole <b>mixtures,</b> the <b>saturate,</b> and aromatic fractions had different intrinsic toxicities; the aromatics were more toxic than the saturates. The toxicity of the saturate and aromatic fractions also differed between the <b>mixtures.</b> The flare <b>saturate</b> <b>mixture</b> was more toxic than the crude <b>saturate</b> <b>mixture,</b> while the crude aromatic mixture was more toxic than the flare aromatic mixture. The most dramatic difference in toxicity of the two sources was between the flare whole and crude whole mixtures. The crude whole mixture was very toxic; the toxicity of this mixture reflected the toxicity of the crude aromatic fraction. However, the flare whole mixture was not toxic, {{due to a lack of}} partitioning from the whole mixture into the lipid membrane of the exposed worms. This lack of partitioning appears to be related to the relatively high concentrations of asphaltenes and polar compounds in the flare pit whole mixture...|$|R

40|$|Cryogenic damper seals {{operating}} {{close to}} the liquid-vapor region (near the critical point or slightly su-cooled) are likely to present two-phase flow conditions. Under single phase flow conditions the mechanical energy conveyed to the fluid increases its temperature and causes a phase change when the fluid temperature reaches the saturation value. A bulk-flow analysis for the prediction of the dynamic force response of damper seals operating under two-phase conditions is presented as: all-liquid, liquid-vapor, and all-vapor, i. e. a 'continuous vaporization' model. The two phase region is considered as a homogeneous <b>saturated</b> <b>mixture</b> in thermodynamic equilibrium. Th flow in each region is described by continuity, momentum and energy transport equations. The interdependency of fluid temperatures and pressure in the two-phase region (<b>saturated</b> <b>mixture)</b> does not allow {{the use of an}} energy equation in terms of fluid temperature. Instead, the energy transport is expressed in terms of fluid enthalpy. Temperature in the single phase regions, or mixture composition in the two phase region are determined based on the fluid enthalpy. The flow is also regarded as adiabatic since the large axial velocities typical of the seal application determine small levels of heat conduction to the walls as compared to the heat carried by fluid advection. Static and dynamic force characteristics for the seal are obtained from a perturbation analysis of the governing equations. The solution expressed in terms of zeroth and first order fields provide the static (leakage, torque, velocity, pressure, temperature, and mixture composition fields) and dynamic (rotordynamic force coefficients) seal parameters. Theoretical predictions show good agreement with experimental leakage pressure profiles, available from a Nitrogen at cryogenic temperatures. Force coefficient predictions for two phase flow conditions show significant fluid compressibility effects, particularly for mixtures with low mass content of vapor. Under these conditions, an increase on direct stiffness and reduction of whirl frequency ratio are shown to occur. Prediction of such important effects will motivate experimental studies as well as a more judicious selection of the operating conditions for seals used in cryogenic turbomachinery...|$|E

40|$|The {{rheology}} {{of crude}} oil mixtures at equilibrium with carbon dioxide (CO 2) was studied at elevated pressures and temperatures, {{similar to those found}} for oil reservoir conditions. The focus of the work presented in this thesis concerns the measurement of the rheological properties of CO 2 <b>saturated</b> <b>mixtures</b> {{of crude oil}}. The rheology measurements were made using a high-pressure rheometer coupled to a fluid flow system designed and built in this project. The flow system comprised a mixing vessel and fluid flow loop that allowed the test fluid to be brought into equilibrium with CO 2 by stirring and circulating through the rheometer measurement geometry under the pressure and temperature required. Measurements were made for three different fluids saturated with CO 2 : a light crude oil from the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), Zuata heavy crude oil, and an emulsion of Zuata crude oil with deionized water. The rheological measurements for the GoM crude oil were performed at temperatures of 23 °C and 50 °C and pressures from ambient to 220 bar. The CO 2 addition did not change the Newtonian behaviour of the light crude oil, but reduced its viscosity until the phase equilibrium points of CO 2. Beyond the CO 2 phase equilibrium points, the CO 2 mixture viscosity increased with increasing CO 2 pressure, which was expected when the fluid density increased without change in composition. The experiments using the Zuata heavy crude oil and its dilutions with toluene were done at temperatures from 23 °C to 50 °C and pressures from ambient to 220 bar. The Zuata crude oil was changed from a non-Newtonian fluid to Newtonian by CO 2 dissolution.

40|$|Debris flows are {{typically}} a <b>saturated</b> <b>mixture</b> of poorly sorted particles and interstitial fluid, whose {{density and flow}} properties depend strongly {{on the presence of}} suspended fine sediment. Recent research suggests that grain size distribution (GSD) influences excess pore pressures (i. e., pressure in excess of predicted hydrostatic pressure), which in turn plays a governing role in debris flow behaviors. We report a series of controlled laboratory experiments in a 4 [*]m diameter vertically rotating drum where the coarse particle size distribution and the content of fine particles were varied independently. We measured basal pore fluid pressures, pore fluid pressure profiles (using novel sensor probes), velocity profiles, and longitudinal profiles of the flow height. Excess pore fluid pressure was significant for mixtures with high fines fraction. Such flows exhibited lower values for their bulk flow resistance (as measured by surface slope of the flow), had damped fluctuations of normalized fluid pressure and normal stress, and had velocity profiles where the shear was concentrated {{at the base of the}} flow. These effects were most pronounced in flows with a wide coarse GSD distribution. Sustained excess fluid pressure occurred during flow and after cessation of motion. Various mechanisms may cause dilation and contraction of the flows, and we propose that the sustained excess fluid pressures during flow and once the flow has stopped may arise from hindered particle settling and yield strength of the fluid, resulting in transfer of particle weight to the fluid. Thus, debris flow behavior may be strongly influenced by sustained excess fluid pressures controlled by particle settling rates...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} the {{investigation}} of a one-shot cooling technique, called adiabatic expansion of 3 He in superfluid 4 He, are reported. The expansion cooler basically consists of an expansion cell and a 4 He reservoir connected by a superleak. In the expansion cell nearly pure 3 He is gradually diluted to a <b>saturated</b> <b>mixture</b> by the injection of superfluid 4 He from the 4 He reservoir. The expansion of the 3 He produces cooling, which, in the ideal (isentropic) case can lower the temperature by a factor 4. 56. In practice, the performance of this cooling method is limited by irreversibilities and heat leaks. In this paper several irreversible processes such as heat conduction, viscous effects, and supercritical 4 He flow, have been analyzed. Furthermore the effect of 3 He in a sinter layer in the expansion cell is discussed. The experiments have shown that the fountain pressure in the 4 He reservoir is very suitable for driving the 4 He {{in and out of the}} expansion cell. During an expansion/extraction the 4 He chemical potential difference across the superleak is zero. The realised cooling factor, defined as the ratio of the initial temperature and the final temperature, is about 3. 5 for initial temperatures between 20 mK to 190 mK. This value is lower than the ideal factor of 4. 56 that can be obtained for isentropic expansions. The discrepancy is mainly due to the relatively large heat leak. The lowest temperature obtained in this investigation was 5. 7 mK. The analyses have revealed no fundamental limitations for obtaining lower temperatures...|$|E

Leuko-cyte concentration in blood did not differ between groups, but the percentage of blood lymphocytes was lower in broilers from the Red# 3 +PG group compared with birds from the control group (52. 4 ± 2. 9 and 56. 9 ± 2. 9 %, respectively). Cells recovered from the lavage fluid from both groups were primarily heterophils. The concentration of leukocytes was greater in the lavage fluid of broilers from the Red# 3 +PG group compared with broilers from the control group (763. 2 ± 158. 7 and 402. 9 ± 62. 6 white blood cells/µL, respectively), but the proportions among leukocytes were not different between the 2 groups. We propose that the increased concentration of leukocytes present within the airways {{was one of the}} components that enabled broilers pre-treated with aerosolized Red# 3 +PG to exhibit PH re-sponses to intratracheal lipopolysaccharide.

40|$|Subject of investigation: steel 40 H, HVG, ShH 15, H 12 M. Purpose of the work: {{development}} of new methods of boronizing in a vibration fluid bed and of compositions of boronizing media which {{make it possible to}} decrease the temperature and time parameters of the chemical thermal treatment and to lessen brittleness. The investigation included the study of the influence of mixture composition and conditions of the boronizing and boron copper plating on the thickness, structure and phase composition of boron coatings applied by diffusion saturation in the vibration fluidized bed and the study of the influence of copper and its compounds on boronizing process. The work determiness the intensifying and plasticizing effect of copper on iron borides. Practical steps are worked out for optimization of the <b>saturating</b> <b>mixture</b> composition and boron copper plating conditions in order to intensify the saturating process and increase the plasticity of the produced boride layers. Practical recommendations are developed on the boron copper plating in the vibration fluidized bed and are now in useAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
