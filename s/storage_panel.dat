What is used in this paper is a regular flat phase change heat storage module packaging with capillary network and phase change material. In this paper, the software Fluent was used to simulate the impact factors and the ways to enhance heat transfer in the process of phase change. The simulation result indicates that: During the melting process, because of the influence of natural convection, the top of phase change regional melts faster, the temperature contour ramp to top. The higher the horizon is, the temperature contour is more stable. Natural convection play different role in the melting and solidification process, which accelerated melting rate in the melting process, and slowed down in solidification.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{integration}} of phase change materials (PCMs) into building structures. The basic requirement is improved thermal stability during the summer season without using an air conditioner. This {{can be achieved by}} increasing the thermal storage capacity of the building structures. If the thermal capacity cannot be increased on the level of weight, phase change materials can be used. These materials are capable of storing latent heat and thus increasing the thermal storage capacity of the building. In the thesis the phase change materials were investigated in a thermal incubator by thermal analysis and, above all, in full-scale experiments using comparative measurements. The comparative measurements were carried out in two attic rooms at the Faculty of Civil Engineering, Brno University of Technology, where in one was used as a reference and the other for the experiment. Manufactured heat <b>storage</b> <b>panels</b> were installed in the experimental room. These panels are composed of a base plate; the capillary tubes placed on it are coated with modified plaster. The gypsum plaster is modified with micro-capsules paraffin for improving the thermal storage capacity. This system is connected to a thermal air-water pump, by which the <b>storage</b> <b>panels</b> can be additionally cooled or heated. In the experimental measurements, different operating modes were investigated and their effect on the indoor environment was evaluated. Thermal storage in PCMs dampens the temperature amplitude in the building during the summer season and, at the same time, allows the stored heat to be discharged during the night. Moreover, the time interval of withdrawing electric energy from the supply mains is much shorter than in the case of air conditioning. A conventional air conditioner must operate simultaneously with the thermal load, i. e. at the time of peak consumption of electric energy. Thanks to the set regimes, the installed system is capable of responding to external thermal condi...|$|R

The BESP was fabricated through a mold pressing method based on phase change material particle (PCMP), which was prepared in two steps: vacuum absorption and surface film coating. Firstly, phase change material (PCM) was incorporated into expanded perlite (EP) through a vacuum absorption method to obtain composite PCM; secondly, the composite PCM was immersed into the mixture of colloidal silica and organic acrylate, and then it was taken out and dried naturally. A series of experiments, including differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), scanning electron microscope (SEM), best matching test, and durability test, have been conducted to characterize and analyze the thermophysical property and reliability of PCMP. Additionally, the thermal performance of BESP was studied through a dynamic thermal property test. The results have showed that: (1) the surface film coating procedure can effectively solve the leakage problem of composite phase change material prepared by vacuum impregnation; (2) the optimum adsorption ratio for paraffin and EP was 52. 5 : 47. 5 in mass fraction, and the PCMP has good thermal properties, stability, and durability; and (3) in the process of dynamic thermal performance test, BESP have low temperature variation, significant temperature lagging, and large heat storage ability, which indicated the potential of BESP in the application of building energy efficiency...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports the}} {{conclusions}} of the three panel discussions held during the WasteEng 2016 Conference in Albi, France ([URL] It explores {{the research and development}} trends aiming at the production of energy and added value materials from waste and/or biomass. Three approaches are investigated: thermochemical conversion (Panel chairs: M. Castaldi, J. M. Lavoie, C. Vandecasteele), biochemical conversion (Panel chairs: J. Legrand, P. T. Vasudevan, W. Verstraete) and, sustainable construction and energy <b>storage</b> (<b>Panel</b> chairs: J. van Deventer, Y. Pontikes, X. Py). The thermochemical conversion session addressed feedstock, technologies for energy recovery and material recycling, gas cleaning and the marketplace. It is shown that combustion (WtE) is the leading technology and that also much research is devoted to gasification and pyrolysis. The biochemical conversion session noted the ability to yield products applied to different sectors such as food and feed, chemical, biofuels, biomaterials and many others. Innovation oriented towards better exploitation of the existing biocatalytic activity of known enzymes and microbes is also discussed. Recycling of solid and liquid waste received substantial focus in construction. Materials for thermal energy storage from waste are considered a promising use of recycled materials. The paper also shows how entrepreneurs introducing new technology have to work with both technical and commercial uncertainty, which renders investment into new technology a high risk.

Methodological advances have emphasized the use of customer panel data to model the dynamic evolution of a customer base to improve churn predictions. However, pressure from policy makers and the public geared to reducing the storage of customer data has led to firms' âself-policingâ by limiting data <b>storage,</b> rendering <b>panel</b> data methods infeasible. We remedy these problems by developing a method that captures the dynamic evolution of a customer base without relying on the availability past data. Instead, using a recursively updated model our approach requires only knowledge of past model parameters. This generalized mixture of Kalman filters model maintains the accuracy of churn predictions compared to existing panel data methods when data from the past is available. In the absence of past data, applications in the insurance and telecommunications industry establish superior predictive performance compared to simpler benchmarks.

40|$|Interactions {{of light}} and {{electricity}} within matter have been known and studied {{for quite a long}} time. However, a systematic exploration of many relations among optical and electronic phenomena has a more recent history. Solid state optoelectronics is concerned with the technological exploitation of these relations. Photoconductivity studies illuminate the internal electronic processes in semiconductors and helps in the development of highly sensitive materials and devices. Photoconductivity is the increase in electrical conductivity of a material due to adsorption of radiation by it. Materials with special imperfections incorporated during preparation, give large signals. Cadmium sulphide and cadmium selenide are the II â VI compound semiconductors which are useful in the visible and near infrared range. For low levels of illumination (<= 301 x), cadmium sulphide is sluggish in response (response time 100 v m. sec.) while cadmium selenide has a faster response under similar conditions (30 m. sec.). Cadmium sulphide and cadmium selenide form a continuous series of substitution solid solutions and it is reasonable to expect some of these solid solutions might exhibit a broader spectral sensitivity coupled with faster response. Of the various methods available for the preparation of II â VI compound semiconductor layers, sintering of screen printed layers is, by far, the most flexible and inexpensive method for large scale preparation of highly sensitive layers. No systematic studies are reported on sintered cadmium sulphoselenide layers, though quite a large numbers of patents and reports on these for specific purposes are available besides some published literature. Systematic studies on the preparation of photoconductive grade CdS and CdSe powders and sensitization and sintering of these powders to obtain optimum photosensitivity stability have been made. Analyses of the powders and sintered layers by AAS, polarography and EPMA as well as X-ray characterization for true solid solution formation have been made. The effect of various electrode materials like indium, silver, graphite, cadmium oxide and copper are examined and the effect of diffusion of the corresponding ions into the photoconductive layers on the current-voltage behavior both in the dark illumination are examined in detail. The optoelectronics properties like spectral distribution of sensitivity with composition, lux-ampere characterization and response time studies have been measured and correlated. An attempt has been made {{for the first time in}} the case of sintered layers to further enhance the sensitivity CdSxSe(1 -x) layers, by several methods, where such high sensitivity is called for, in specific applications. The possibility of using these CdSxSe(1 -x) layers in sintered CdSxSe(1 -x) : Cu 2 S/Cu 2 Se and CdSxSe(1 -x) : Tl 2 S photovoltaic solar cells has also been examined. Photoconductive CdSxSe(1 -x) cells will continue the interest of the solid state scientists and future applications may include image intensifiers and image <b>storage</b> <b>panels</b> in solar energy conversion and in electro photography. Logic flexibility can be incorporated into optoelectronic network using threshold of photosensitivity. Such devices will tend resemble more and more that of biological neural network such as neuro-retina in vertebrates, which will response only to inputs which are characteristic of some specific behavior. Intelligence coding, language transformation and automation of thought processes are some of the lines which will continue to interest the optoelectronic scientists. ...|$|R
