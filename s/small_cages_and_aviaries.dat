40|$|Metal–organic {{frameworks}} (MOFs) are a novel {{family of}} physisorptive materials that have exhibited great promise for methane storage. So far, a detailed {{understanding of their}} methane adsorption mechanism is still scarce. Herein, we report a comprehensive mechanistic study of methane storage in three milestone MOF compounds (HKUST- 1, PCN- 11, and PCN- 14) the CH 4 storage capacities of which are among the highest reported so far among all porous materials. The three MOFs consist of the same dicopper paddlewheel secondary building units, but contain different organic linkers, leading to cagelike pores with various sizes and geometries. From neutron powder diffraction experiments and accurate data analysis, assisted by grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations and DFT calculations, we unambiguously revealed the exact locations of the stored methane molecules in these MOF materials. We found that methane uptake takes place primarily at two types of strong adsorption site: 1) the open Cu coordination sites, which exhibit enhanced Coulomb attraction toward methane, and 2) the van der Waals potential pocket sites, in which the total dispersive interactions are enhanced due to the molecule being in contact with multiple “surfaces”. Interestingly, the enhanced van der Waals sites are present exclusively in <b>small</b> <b>cages</b> <b>and</b> at the windows to these cages, whereas large cages with relatively flat pore surfaces bind very little methane. Our results suggest that further, rational development of new MOF compounds for methane storage applications should focus on enriching open metal sites, increasing the volume percentage of accessible <b>small</b> <b>cages</b> <b>and</b> channels, and minimizing the fraction of large pores. © 2010, Wiley-VCH Verlag Berli...|$|R

40|$|We have {{performed}} molecular dynamics calculations {{to obtain a}} number of properties of a doubly occupied structure II N 2 clathrate hydrate, in particular to study its behavior under higher pressures. The calculated neutron diffraction pattern is {{in agreement with the}} experimental result. The effect of the presence of the filling of the <b>small</b> <b>cages</b> <b>and</b> of the large cages (in either single or double occupancy) on the calculated pattern is demonstrated and discussed. The calculated Raman spectra show that the average vibrational frequency of the N 2 molecules decreases in going from the singly occupied <b>small</b> <b>cages</b> to the doubly occupied large <b>cages</b> <b>and</b> then to the singly occupied large cages, respectively. The frequency distributions are explained in terms of radial distribution functions. When applying large pressures at low temperatures, a clathrate-amorphous transition occurs for a partially doubly occupied clathrate. The transition occurs at about the same pressure as for single occupations, but the densification is larger for the latter. In both cases, the transition is reversible.

Simulations are done at pressures of 2. 5 kbars and 1. 013 bars and for temperatures ranging from 100 to 250 K. For a structure II unit cell with 136 water molecules, H 2 guest molecule occupancies of 08 ̆ 21164 are studied with uniform occupancies among each type of cage. The simulations show that at 100 K and 2. 5 kbars, the most stable configurations have single occupancy in the <b>small</b> <b>cages</b> <b>and</b> quadruple occupancy in the large cages. The optimum occupancy for the large cages decreases as the temperature is raised.

40|$|At present {{there are}} {{important}} changes in hous-ing systems in laying hen husbandry. Henceforward, only alternative husbandry systems shall be allowed, among which deep litter systems can be included. Therefore, many authors are engaged in the investi-gation of alternative systems, their advantages and disadvantages. Savory (2004) stated that from the welfare view-point cage systems were burdened {{with a lack of}} space for laying hens, however, conversely they ensured the better health status of laying hens. Petermann (2003) concluded that alternative aviary systems with deep litter were burdened with higher mortality of laying hens. De Boer and Cornelissen (2002) considered battery cages to be more favour-able than aviary systems, in particular from the viewpoint of stock economics, ammonia emission, egg quality and farmer welfare. Duncan (2001) analysed advantages and disadvantages of battery cage systems. He considered the low incidence of diseases, low incidence of social frictions, and the absence of problems resulting from litter as the main advantages. The disadvantages were found to be a lack of both physical and psychological space for laying hens, lack of space for daily activities and nesting and dust bathing opportunities, and a high-er incidence of foot lesions.
