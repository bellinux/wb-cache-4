40|$|The {{scientific}} basis {{for managing the}} <b>short</b> <b>fin</b> <b>squid,</b> Illex argentinus, Stock around the Falkland Islands is presented. A target proportional escapement policy is used which permits a level of fishing effort compatible with conservation targets to be set each year. This policy is intimately related to the method of assessing stock size {{and the rate of}} fishing mortality presented in a related paper. The results of applying this management procedure for the 1987 and 1988 fishing seasons, the first 2 years of regulated fishing in Falkland Islands waters, are described. The policy has the considerable benefit that the data requirements and monitoring procedures are straightforward, and can be implemented by the limited manpower resources of the islands...|$|E
40|$|Maps {{indicating}} the distributions of northern <b>short</b> <b>fin</b> <b>squid</b> (Illex illecebrosus) during spring (1996 - 2005) and autumn (1995 - 2005) bottom trawl surveys {{were prepared to}} determine the most appropriate survey sampling strata to use in deriving annual relative abundance and biomass indices for {{the portion of the}} stock in Subarea 3. During both the spring and autumn surveys, I. illecebrosus are distributed in only a few strata rather than across many strata. Spring surveys indicate an inshore migration from deeper waters during May to shallower waters of the Grand Banks during June. Most of the Illex catches during the autumn surveys occurred offshore in deep water, during October-mid-December, but some catches also occurred near shore during the same time period. It is expected that utilization of the proposed subsets of strata from each survey will improve the precision of the annual rel ative abundance and biomass indices of Illex. However, annual precision estimates must be computed to confi rm this expect ation. In addition, it is unknown whether the survey distribution patterns refl ect the timing of the surveys in relation to the species ’ annual migrations through the survey areas or whether they reflect Illex abundance...|$|E

40|$|Dipeptidyl {{aminopeptidase}} I (cathepsin C, E. C. 3. 14. 3. 1) {{was isolated}} from the hepatopancreas of the Atlantic <b>short</b> <b>finned</b> <b>squid</b> (Illex illecebrosus) and partially purified by the successive steps of autolysis of an acid extract, ammonium sulfate precipitation, heat treatment, ultrafiltration and affinity chromatography using p-CMB-Sepharose column. On SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the enzyme gave one major and one minor band corresponding to a molecular weight of about 25 and 62 kdaltons, respectively. The identification of cathepsin C is based on (1) its ability to catalyze a transferase reaction with Gly-Phe-NH₂ and a hydrolase reaction with Gly-Phe-NA or Ser-Tyr-NA at pH optima of 7 and 6, respectively; (2) the Cl⁻ ion and sulfhydryl activation of the enzyme; (3) its inhibition by known inhibitors of cathepsin C; and (4) the apparent existence of a 25 kdaltons subunit, which forms associated complexes of 50, 100 and 200 kdaltons. The dissociation and reassociation of cathepsin C in relation to its catalytic functions as a transferase and a hydrolase were studied by examining the ultrafiltration behavior of the enzyme following heat treatment or exposure to detergent or urea...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{characteristics}} of heat transfer enhancement and deterioration in supercritical water reactor core {{is essential to}} the reactor efficiency and security. At present, there exists deficiency in the study of core enhanced channels. Two different fins arrangements of the enhanced channels are designed in present paper, which are long-strip <b>fins</b> and equal-distance <b>short</b> <b>fins.</b> At the conditions of the supercritical pressure of 25 MPa, the inlet temperature of 350 ℃ and different inlet velocities, the heat transfer enhancement and deterioration {{characteristics of}} water flowing in the two different fins arrangements of the enhanced channels were studied and comparatively analyzed. The results show that the heat transfer is enhanced in the channels with fins. The heat transfer enhancement is better in the channel with equal-distance <b>short</b> <b>fins</b> when lower input velocity, better in the channel with long-strip fins when high input velocity. The surface heat transfer coefficients increase with the velocity increases; the surface heat transfer coefficients in equal-distance <b>short</b> <b>fins</b> is two to three times than that in the channel without fins. There exists heat transfer deterioration when the input velocity is lower in the channel without fins and with long-strip fins, no deterioration occurs in the channel with equal-distance <b>short</b> <b>fins.</b> The channel with equal-distance <b>short</b> <b>fins</b> is a relatively reasonable of the three channels...|$|R
40|$|Females often {{choose to}} {{associate}} with males that have exaggerated traits. In fishes, this may reflect an overall preference for larger size in a potential mate. Female zebrafish (Danio rerio) prefer males with larger bodies but not longer fins. The availability of mutant and transgenic strains of zebrafish make this a unique model system in which to study the role of phenotypic variation in social and sexual behavior. We used mutant strains of zebrafish with truncated (<b>short</b> <b>fin)</b> and exaggerated (long fin) fins to further examine female preferences for fin length in dichotomous association tests. Wild type females showed no preferences between wild type males and <b>short</b> <b>fin</b> mutant males or between wild type males and long <b>fin</b> mutant males. <b>short</b> <b>fin</b> females also showed no preference for <b>short</b> <b>fin</b> males or wild type males while long fin females preferred {{to associate with}} long fin males over wild type males. These {{results suggest that the}} single gene long fin mutation that results in altered fin morphological may also be involved in a related female association preference...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} based on the {{analysis}} of unsteady heat conduction through <b>short</b> <b>fin</b> with applicability of quasi theory. “The area exposed to the surrounding is frequently increased by the attachment of protrusions to the surfaces, and the arrangement provides a means by which heat transfer rate can be substantially improved. The protrusions are called fins”. The fins are commonly used on small power developing machine as engine used for motor cycle as well as small capacity compressor. Earlier, Work under steady state conduction had been carried out extensively. Unsteady heat conduction analysis for the fins is being done for calculation of heat transfer. Unsteady Closed form solutions had been derived earlier by various researchers. Exact solutions are given for the unsteady temperature in flux-base fins with the method of Green’s Functions (GF) in the form of infinite series for three different tip conditions. The time of convergence is improved by replacing the series part by closed form solution. The present study supplies a new approach to calculate the thermal performance of the <b>short</b> <b>fin.</b> For the <b>short</b> <b>fin</b> case, exact fin solution and a quasi-steady solution is presented. Numerical values are presented and the conditions under which the quasi-steady solution is accurate are determined.

40|$|Lake Bondi are two populations with partial {{reproductive}} isolation and non-random mating. Genetic diVerentiation {{between the two}} groups was supported by diVerences in allele fre-quencies and by deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium when the two groups were pooled; no such deviation was observed when fish were divided into littoral and pelagic groups. In contrast to Lake Bondi, no clear evidence of genetic diVerentiation was observed in Lake Ledoux. Discriminant function analyses of morphological characters support the existence of littoral and pelagic groups in Bondi and Ledoux Lakes. In Lake Bondi, the two groups diVered significantly in two shape variables (pelagic fish had <b>shorter</b> dorsal <b>fins,</b> and longer body length posterior to the dorsal fin than littoral ones) whereas in Lake Ledoux, the groups diVered in four shape variables (pelagic fish had <b>shorter</b> pectoral <b>fins,</b> <b>shorter</b> dorsal <b>fins,</b> and a <b>shorter</b> and higher caudal peduncle than littoral ones). Discriminant analyses of these characters were eVective in reclassifying fish into their appropriate groups in both populations, with an eYciency of 78 % for juveniles in Lake Bondi and 69 % for adults in Lake Ledoux. DiVerences in morphology between the two forms are consistent with adaptations required to forage in each zone, i. e. benthic form in the littoral zone and planktivorous form in the pelagic zone...|$|R
