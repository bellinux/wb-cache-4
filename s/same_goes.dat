5|$|On June 13, 2016, {{following}} {{the release of}} iOS 10, Apple dropped support on the iPad 2 due to hardware limitations. The <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> with the iPad (3rd generation) and iPad Mini (1st generation), making iOS 9 the final version supported on the device.|$|E
5|$|At {{the eastern}} side of the pyramid, the {{remnants}} of brick walls could indicate the presence of a mortuary temple, but the archaeological traces are so tenuous that any closer examination and more precise reconstruction is impossible today. The <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> for the ruins of a building several hundred metres away from the pyramid, and which might have been the valley temple. If this was indeed a valley temple, its east-west orientation would be unique in all pyramid complexes.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, 2010, Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine {{approved}} {{the structure of}} the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Note, Tihipko even though is a leader of the Strong Ukraine party, he was elected to Cabinet as unaffiliated. Strong Ukraine in Verkhovna Rada is not an independent party. The <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> with Vasyl Tsushko who was {{a former member of the}} Socialist Party of Ukraine at the time of his appointment (he became the leader of that party in July 2010); Tsushko was appointed on quote of the Communist Party.|$|E

50|$|A {{player can}} either move {{normally}} or attack (or six) a blob. A piece cannot be moved {{next to a}} blob and then, on the <b>same</b> <b>go,</b> attack it.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A 2009 {{image of}} a White House staffer's African-American son {{touching}} President Barack Obama's head, {{checking to see if}} their hair felt the <b>same,</b> <b>went</b> viral in 2012.|$|R
5|$|Variation of {{the wing}} beat may also occur, not just amongst {{different}} species, but even among individuals at different times. In general, the frequency is dependent upon the ratio between the power {{of the wing}} muscles and the resistance of the load. Large-winged, light-bodied butterflies may have a wing beat frequency of 4–20 per second whereas small-winged, heavy-bodied flies and bees beat their wings more than 100 times a second and mosquitoes can beat up to 988–1046 times a second. The <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> for flight; though it is generally difficult to estimate the speed of insects in flight, most insects can probably fly faster in nature than they do in controlled experiments.|$|E
25|$|DeLorean's name is {{correctly}} spelled {{without the}} space, as DeLorean; the <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> for the Company.|$|E
25|$|The <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> for the men's tournament (the area {{north and}} west of the Ural River is located in Europe, thus Kazakhstan is a transcontinental country), when Harbin will host the 2018 Division B tournament.|$|E
5000|$|You are {{swearing}} {{now that}} some day you will destroy me. Remember: far better women than you have sworn to do the <b>same.</b> <b>Go</b> look for them now. Atia ...|$|R

50|$|But he {{can still}} claim 4 or 6 Bamboo for the win during the very <b>same</b> <b>go</b> around and when his turn comes, {{he can still}} 'Self-Pick'(自摸zì-mō) 3 Bamboo to win.|$|R
25|$|The infant {{mortality}} rate was high. If a son had died before his next brother was born, this younger brother was usually given the same name. The <b>same</b> <b>goes,</b> mutatis mutandis, for a daughter. When the father died before {{the birth of a}} son, the son was usually named after him. When the mother died at the birth of a daughter, the daughter was usually named after the mother.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from losing}} points from a house, serious misdeeds at Hogwarts are {{punishable}} by detention. Whenever a student loses a house point, their house jewels (ruby for Gryffindors, emeralds for Slytherin, sapphires for Ravenclaw, and topazes for Hufflepuff) are {{taken away from}} a glass hourglass located in every classroom. The <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> for adding points to the specific house, although the teacher or prefect must conjure the gems from thin air.|$|E
25|$|Words {{are rarely}} not listed in {{dictionaries}} (in which case {{they would be}} lexical items) {{on the basis of}} their inflectional morphemes. However, they often are listed {{on the basis of their}} derivational morphemes. For instance, English dictionaries list readable and readability, words with derivational suffixes, along with their root read. However, no traditional English dictionary lists book as one entry and books as a separate entry; the <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> for jump and jumped.|$|E
50|$|Avicii {{cancelled}} {{his first}} {{weekend of the}} festival. The <b>same</b> <b>went</b> for Rita Ora and Magda. Also, DJ Fresh withdrew from the 2013 lineup. Borgore {{did not go to}} Malaysia at that time for the festival.|$|R
50|$|When {{a player}} discard a certain tile, {{it will be}} the Sacred Discard for that player, because he cannot claim the same {{identical}} tile from other players' discards for the win or 'Pong'(碰pèng) during the very <b>same</b> <b>go</b> around.|$|R
5000|$|Unless {{the rule}} is change from [...] "Sacred & Missed Discards only valid within the very <b>same</b> <b>go</b> around" [...] to 'Only valid till his next turn", then the above scenarios, East player {{is not allowed to}} claim it.|$|R
25|$|If someone {{creates a}} business, it is theirs for their entire life, {{and they can}} rent it out, but never for more than forty-nine years. The <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> for farmers. They can rent land and {{cultivate}} it for forty-nine years but after that it all {{goes back to the}} State which will be able to rent it out again for another forty-nine years. Their children can also rent it for forty-nine years.|$|E
25|$|The <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> for {{readings}} of literary texts says Pommier. For example, Molière's Don Juan only pursues one love object for mediated reasons, {{not all of}} them, as Girard claims. Or again, Sancho Panza wants an island not because he is catching the bug of romanticism from Don Quixote, but {{because he has been}} promised one. And Pavel Pavlovitch, in Dostoevsky's Eternal Husband, has been married for ten years before Veltchaninov becomes his rival, so Veltchaninov is not in fact essential to Pavel's desire.|$|E
25|$|Municipal {{and provincial}} {{regulations}} may impact availability, {{in particular in}} Austria and Switzerland, which allows cities and provinces to regulate the selling of the least-regulated schedule of the SMG/BtMG. Individual chemists' shops can opt out of providing them or imposing volume, frequency, or single-purchase limitations and other things of the same store. Plain codeine hydrochloride tablets {{as well as other}} non-injectable forms of codeine and its midrange derivatives can be dispensed in this way; the <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> for most chemical classes of benzodiazepines, the majority of non-barbiturate sedative/hypnotics, and at least a handful of barbiturates.|$|E
5000|$|Note: There {{might be}} some dispute with the Sacred & Missed Discards {{especially}} with [...] "the very <b>same</b> <b>go</b> around". For example, East player misses the chance to claim it, that tile should be either the Sacred or Missed Discard for East player.|$|R
50|$|But he {{can still}} claim 4 or 6 Bamboo for the win during the very <b>same</b> <b>go</b> around and when his turn comes, {{he can still}} 'Self-Pick'(自摸zì-mō) 3 Bamboo to win since in Singaporean Mahjong, one {{does not need to}} reveal the 'Self-Pick'(自摸zì-mō) tile.|$|R
5000|$|For example, East player {{discarded}} a 3 Bamboo without realising {{that he had}} {{a winning}} hand with 4555 Bamboo. So when South, West or North players discard a 3 Bamboo, he cannot claim it for the win during the very <b>same</b> <b>go</b> around, otherwise it will be considered as a 'Fake Hand'(诈胡zhà-hú)! ...|$|R
25|$|While Canada was {{the third}} country to build a {{satellite}} which was launched into space, it was launched aboard an American rocket from an American spaceport. The <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> for Australia, who launched first satellite involved a donated U.S. Redstone rocket and American support staff {{as well as a}} joint launch facility with the United Kingdom. The first Italian satellite San Marco 1 launched on 15 December 1964 on a U.S. Scout rocket from Wallops Island (Virginia, United States) with an Italian launch team trained by NASA. By similar occasions, almost all further first national satellites was launched by foreign rockets.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} {{of a new}} life means changing and adapting. Beginning freshmen enter a new phase that affects the way they eat. They are unaware of their nutrition and they only want something from what they see. High school {{is very different from}} what college is. Students transition from being in small classroom into big lecture rooms. The <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> for food, they transition from being served in cafeterias to buffet styles in college. Dining centers excite new students because this is a new experience, therefore they grab more than what they should. It’s something new and it’s what they’re paying for.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Standard of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is royal yellow {{with the}} Coat of arms of Malaysia in the centre, {{surrounded}} by a rice paddy wreath. The <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> for the Royal Standards of the Raja Permaisuri Agong and the Timbalan Yang di-Pertuan Agong, but the designs are different. The Raja Permaisuri Agong's standard is green in colour, with the coat of arms at the centre surrounded by the paddy wreath. The Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong's standard is bicolored, yellow {{at the top and}} light blue at the bottom, with the coat of arms at the centre (without the paddy) and below that is the office bearer's title.|$|E
5000|$|For example, East {{player has}} 4555 Bamboo in his hand, South player {{discarded}} a 3 Bamboo. East player did not claim it. So when West or North players discard {{the very same}} 3 Bamboo during the very <b>same</b> <b>go</b> around, East player is prohibited to claim for the win, otherwise it will {{be considered as a}} 'Fake Hand'(诈胡zhà-hú)! ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>same</b> ritual <b>goes</b> on {{to give a}} list {{of related}} Taoist deities.|$|R
30|$|In {{the next}} example, we {{show how the}} <b>same</b> ideas <b>go</b> across to higher {{dimensional}} models.|$|R
25|$|Morphine is also {{available}} in a paste that {{is used in the}} production of heroin, which can be smoked by itself or turned to a soluble salt and injected; the <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> for the penultimate products of the Kompot (Polish Heroin) and black tar processes. Poppy straw as well as opium can yield morphine of purity levels ranging from poppy tea to near-pharmaceutical-grade morphine by itself or with all of the more than 50 other alkaloids. It also is the active narcotic ingredient in opium and all of its forms, derivatives, and analogues as well as forming from breakdown of heroin and otherwise present in many batches of illicit heroin as the result of incomplete acetylation.|$|E
25|$|Two images Henri Bergson gave in {{his essay}} An Introduction to Metaphysics may aid us in comprehending the ideas of intuition, analyses, the {{absolute}} and the relative. The first image is a city reconstructed with juxtaposed photographs taken from every viewpoint and angle. The reconstruction can never give us the dimensional value of walking through the actual city. This can only ever be grasped through a simple intuition. The <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> for the experience of reading a single line of Homer. If you wish to explain this experience to someone who cannot speak ancient Greek, you may translate the line and lay commentary upon commentary, but this commentary shall never grasp the dimensional value of experiencing the poem in its original language.|$|E
25|$|After {{announcing his}} {{intentions}} to not renew his contract, Whatmore was not {{linked with the}} job of national cricket coaches of India in any way the <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> for England and Pakistan. But England named Peter Moores as their new coach while India appointed Ravi Shastri as the temporary national coach. Since Shastri declared {{that he was not}} interested in the job long-term, Whatmore was considered as a strong contender for the role of coach. During India's 2007 tour of Bangladesh, talks took place between him and BCCI officials, and although it seemed he was the favourite to get the job, on 4 June 2007, BCCI treasurer N Srinivasan, a member of the Search Committee announced that Graham Ford and John Emburey had been invited for talks, hinting that Dav Whatmore was not under consideration anymore.|$|E
50|$|Disney reunited the Robin Hood team in The Sword and the Rose (1953), with Todd as Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. It was not {{as popular}} as Robin Hood in the US but {{performed}} well in Europe. The <b>same</b> <b>went</b> for Disney's, Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue (1953), in which Todd played the title role. Disney pulled back on making costume films as a result.|$|R
5000|$|In this period, it {{was said}} of Charles XII that [...] "he could not retreat, only attack or fall." [...] The <b>same</b> <b>went</b> for his soldiers. In the Swedish army tactics of that time, retreat was never covered, and they were obliged to attack or fight where they stood. This was a {{military}} doctrine that (with the advantage of hindsight) might have proven a bit rash.|$|R
50|$|Elsewhere, the <b>same</b> {{function}} <b>went</b> by the -in principle higher- title director-general, as in Demerara-Essequibo (Dutch Guyana).|$|R
