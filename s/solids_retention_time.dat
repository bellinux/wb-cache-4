40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, the {{environmental}} impact of wastes discharged from high-density flow-through fish-production systems has been viewed with increasing concern. Recirculating aquaculture systems are gaining wider acceptance because of their ability to reduce waste discharges, improve quality control, and reduce costs. The crucial processes that must be addressed in treating recirculating water are solids capture, biofiltration, aeration, degasification, and ion balance. One of the greatest potentials for cost reduction rests with the development of designs that integrate two or more of these processes. Expandable granular biofilters (EGBs) integrate solids capture and biofiltration in a single unit process, potentially reducing the cost of treatment. Backwash frequency, a major operational parameter, influences the rate of nitrification and the volume of sludge produced. Computer and mass balance models allow the relationship between <b>solids</b> <b>retention</b> <b>time,</b> sludge production, and nitrification rates to be examined. While infrequent backflushing decreases water loss and sludge production, nitrification rates decline for extended solids retention times. Declining nitrification rates reflect ammonification of the accreting solids mass and a decrease in the availability of oxygen due to heterotrophic competition and increased mass-transfer resistance. Nitrification appears to be optimized with <b>solids</b> <b>retention</b> <b>time...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of mesophilic anaerobic digesters of four large Italian {{wastewater treatment plants}} without primary sedimentation were studied. Only the waste activated sludge is stabilised {{by means of the}} mesophilic (35 – 37 8 C) anaerobic digestion process. The anaerobic digesters generally worked with a hydraulic <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> in a range of 20 – 40 days and an organic loading rate of some 1 kg VS/m 3 reactor day. The solids content of the sludge fed to the digesters was in the range 2. 6 – 3. 9 % and the gas produced per kilogram of volatile solids added was in the range 0. 07 – 0. 18 m 3 /kg VSfed. The specific gas production per kilogram of volatile solids destroyed was in the range 0. 5 – 0. 9 m 3 / kg VSdestroyed and the reduction of the volatile solids concentration was in the range 13 – 27 % (average 18 %). These figures are particularly significant when designing anaerobic digesters for the treatment of waste activated sludge as single substrate.

50|$|The {{other key}} {{steps in the}} recent MBR {{development}} were the acceptance of modest fluxes (25 percent or less {{of those in the}} first generation), and the idea to use two-phase bubbly flow to control fouling. The lower operating cost obtained with the submerged configuration along with the steady decrease in the membrane cost encouraged an exponential increase in MBR plant installations from the mid 90s. Since then, further improvements in the MBR design and operation have been introduced and incorporated into larger plants. While early MBRs were operated at <b>solid</b> <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> (SRT) as high as 100 days with MLSS up to 30 g/L, the recent trend is to apply lower <b>solid</b> <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> (around 10-20 days), resulting in more manageable MLSS levels (10 to 15 g/L). Thanks to these new operating conditions, the oxygen transfer and the pumping cost in the MBR have tended to decrease and overall maintenance has been simplified.

Developing the high performance processes has a significant goal {{in order to promote}} energy efficiency and reduce the cost sewage sludge treatment. The problem of sewage sludge disposal is becoming top one which almost cost 50 % of running fee for a municipal wastewater treatment plant. This paper basically introduces three methods to improve the conventional digestion. However, they enhance the conventional digestion from different aspects. For examples, Two-phase anaerobic digestion enables to exhibit the merit of thermophilic anaerobic digestion and avoid the weak points of conventional digestion regarding odor problem. In two-phase anaerobic digestion, the acid and methane producing stages are separated. Extended <b>solids</b> <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> is an approach to separate the hydraulic retention time and <b>solids</b> <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> in an anaerobic digester by using recycle thickening.

Enhancing this part of process is an efficient way to increase the solid content of sludge that would reduce the transportation costs. In a nutshell, no matter on saving cost or energy perspectives, these three methods all promote biogas production efficiency up to a better performance, but various requirement of energy and cost are demanded.

40|$|Abstract—Anaerobic {{ammonium}} oxidation (Anammox), {{which is}} assumed to be an appropriate process for the treatment of nitrogen-rich wastewater, is a promising and novel biological nitrogen removal process with attractive application prospects. However, the drawback of this cost-effective process is the low growth rate of Anammox bacteria. So the Anammox process are often operated at a long <b>solids</b> <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> (SRT) in order to cultivate biomass successfully. The granulation of Anammox biomass offers an effective strategy to retain the biomass in Anammox reactors compared with other formation of sludge. This paper reviewed the up-to-date research progress, the property, the cultivation, as well as the application of Anammox granular sludge worldwide.

The biokinetic coefficients for the process were derived by operating laboratory-scale plant at four different input chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations and four differing <b>solids</b> <b>retention</b> <b>times.</b> Results showed effluent COD to be correlated with input feed growth and proportional to the product of feed strength and specific growth rate.

40|$|Continuous {{stirred tank}} {{reactors}} (CSTR) operated at 35 "C, were efficaciously {{used for the}} anaerobic digestion of a petrochemical effluent. Biofiltrationof petrochemical wastewater was carried out {{and the results were}} evaluated in terms of basic water quality parameters. The effects of organic loadings, <b>solid</b> <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> were also investigated. COD reductions of 93 - 98 % were found at an optimum <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> of 2. 3 days and a loading rate of 4. 7 kg COD/m 3 /d. The amount of biogas produced was 0. 88 m 3 /m 3 /d (STP) with a methane content of 90 - 96 %. Volatile fatty acid removal was also achieved up to 97 % after performing biofiltration process. Therefore, the current work revils that bio-filtration of petrochemical wastewater using CSTR might be an effective solution to the prevailing treatment limitation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} high-rate {{activated sludge}} treatment across {{a broad range of}} short <b>solids</b> <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> (SRT) s (0. 5 - 3 d) and found a strong SRT-outcome dependence for performance and subsequent anaerobic degradability of the sludge. Up to 50 % total nitrogen, and 35 % ammonia removal was also achieved at the longer SRTs, via partitioning rather than reaction. The aerobic SRT significantly affected the anaerobic degradability of the sludge produced (p < 0. 001), with degradability increasing from 66 % to over 80 % while reducing the SRT from 3 d to 0. 5 d. This is higher than predicted by conventional models, likely due to additional mechanisms such as adsorption and storage, not included in these...|$|R
