5|$|The Packers {{lost to the}} San Francisco 49ers in a Wild Card Round {{playoff game}} in 1998. Favre had rallied the team with a {{touchdown}} pass to wide receiver Antonio Freeman with 1:56 remaining in the game to put the Packers up 27–23. However, <b>Steve</b> <b>Young</b> responded with a touchdown of his own to wide receiver Terrell Owens with three seconds remaining to end the Packers season. Favre and the Packers failed {{for the first time}} since 1994 to at least reach the NFC Championship.|$|E

5|$|Reuben Mayes {{rushed for}} 147 yards, the second-most in New Orleans Saints history, as the Saints equalled their highest-ever margin of victory. The Saints scored {{on their first}} three possessions. The Buccaneers did not score until the fourth quarter, when Steve DeBerg ran for a 1-yard touchdown. <b>Steve</b> <b>Young</b> left the stadium on crutches, and {{starting}} defensive end Ron Holmes left the game after trying to play the first quarter with a broken fibula. Mayes was selected with a third-round draft pick that had been obtained from the Buccaneers in exchange for safety David Greenwood, who the Buccaneers had already waived.|$|E

5|$|St. Louis Cardinals Pro Bowl rookie Vai Sikahema tied an NFL {{record by}} {{returning}} two punts for touchdowns as the Buccaneers clinched the NFL's worst {{record for the}} second consecutive year. Frank Garcia, playing with a back injury, had a third punt blocked for a net gain of 1 yard. The Buccaneers scored first, on a 1-yard Bobby Howard run, but the Cardinals' 21 unanswered points gave them the lead for good before halftime. A 33-yard touchdown pass from <b>Steve</b> <b>Young</b> to Phil Freeman brought the Buccaneers to within 4 points in the third quarter. The game not only ended a futile season for the Buccaneers, but also concluded the Cardinals' worst season since moving to St. Louis 27 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|The Green Bay Packers {{had seven}} {{different}} players each contribute a sack, and Randy Wright's 190 yards passing {{made him the}} second player in Packers history to throw for 3,000 yards in a season. The crowd cheered the news that an Indianapolis Colts win moved the Buccaneers into first place {{for the rights to}} the first overall draft pick, and pelted Buccaneer players with lemons. Ron Holmes's sack of Wright was the Buccaneers' first since Oct. 12, and Ivory Sully recorded the first blocked punt in Buccaneers (regular-season) history. Both teams went to their second-string quarterbacks in the second half, but <b>Steve</b> <b>Young</b> returned to the game after Steve DeBerg suffered a concussion, and Wright was reinserted after the Buccaneers threatened to start a comeback.|$|E
5|$|As {{a product}} tie-in with the 2005–2006 NFL season, Burger King {{introduced}} a 36 piece party pack as {{a limited time}} offer. This promotion was more general and featured the BK mascot, the Burger King, digitally superimposed into NFL game footage so appeared {{to be involved in}} the game. Some of the players the King replaced include <b>Steve</b> <b>Young,</b> Deion Sanders, and Moe Williams. He has also been depicted performing the Lambeau Leap and dumping Gatorade on the head of former Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula. The primary packaging was altered to include the NFL logo; the party pack designed to mimic the texture of a football, included the NFL logo and a humorous comment along the line of those found on BK packaging at the time.|$|E

5|$|Coach Leeman Bennett {{treated the}} season as a {{building}} season, but was disappointed with the team's mental errors and lack of progress. Later in the season, he would begin to privately admit that the Buccaneers' talent was much worse than he had realized. Steve DeBerg won the starting quarterback job after outplaying <b>Steve</b> <b>Young</b> in the preseason, but was benched in favor of Young after struggling {{in the first two}} games. Kevin House and Jimmie Giles were released after an October loss to the New Orleans Saints, along with ex-Dallas Cowboys fullback Ron Springs. Bennett showed up at a press conference held after the season by owner Hugh Culverhouse, unaware {{that the purpose of the}} press conference was to announce Bennett's firing. Giles, then with the Detroit Lions, criticized the move, saying that no coach could compensate for the Buccaneers' lack of talent. He also claimed that administrator Phil Krueger destroyed team chemistry by demeaning players during contract negotiations, pointing to guard Sean Farrell's disgruntlement as an example.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers almost {{exceeded}} their worst-ever loss, a 42–0 {{loss to the}} Pittsburgh Steelers, on its 10th anniversary. They {{were shut}} out until the fourth quarter, and only scored when Chicago Bears safety Todd Bell intercepted a <b>Steve</b> <b>Young</b> pass and lateraled it to Mike Richardson, who attempted to lateral it to Shaun Gayle, only to have Tampa Bay receiver Vince Heflin intercept the lateral and run it in for a score. Mike Tomczak ran for the Bears' first score. Later, a Walter Payton touchdown was called back on a holding penalty. The Buccaneers stopped the Bears on fourth-and-1, but an offside penalty on Craig Swoope gave the Bears another chance. Tomczak fumbled, however, causing him to be benched in favor of Doug Flutie. Flutie scored two touchdowns, one passing and one running, before Tomczak returned in the second half. Tampa Bay scored a second time on Young's 14-yard pass to Calvin Magee, but Lew Barnes returned the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown. Magee's 143 receiving yards remain (as of 2009) the Buccaneers' single-game record for a tight end.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 19 head {{coaches in the}} history of the San Francisco 49ers {{professional}} football franchise. The San Francisco 49ers franchise was formed in 1946 as a charter member of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) before joining the National Football League (NFL) in 1950 after the AAFC merger with the NFL. Buck Shaw became the first head coach of the 49ers in 1946, serving for nine seasons—four in the AAFC and five in the NFL. He coached a number of future College and Pro Football Hall of Famers, such as Frankie Albert, Joe Perry, Leo Nomellini, Y. A. Tittle, Bob St. Clair and Hugh McElhenny. In terms of tenure, Bill Walsh has coached more games (152) and more complete seasons (10) than any other head coach in 49ers franchise history. He led the 49ers to playoff appearances in seven seasons, three of which led to the Super Bowl championship, in 1981, 1984 and 1988. Jerry Rice, Joe Montana, Charles Haley, Ronnie Lott, Johnny Davis, Roger Craig, Fred Dean and <b>Steve</b> <b>Young</b> are among the players Walsh has coached in his career.|$|E
50|$|Grbac {{was drafted}} in the eighth round (219th oveall) of the 1993 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers, where he served as <b>Steve</b> <b>Young's</b> backup from 1994-to-1996.|$|R

50|$|The 1999 San Francisco 49ers {{season was}} the team's 50th {{year with the}} National Football League. This would also be <b>Steve</b> <b>Young's</b> last season as {{he was forced to}} retire due to concussions.|$|R
5|$|Veteran quarterback Bill Kenney, {{making the}} {{start for the}} Kansas City Chiefs {{in place of the}} {{struggling}} Todd Blackledge, completed 15 of 29 passes for 230 yards and a touchdown. The Chiefs' offensive line protected Kenney well, allowing only one sack and few hurries. Although the Buccaneers led at halftime on a 10-yard pass from <b>Steve</b> <b>Young</b> to Calvin Magee and two Donald Igwebuike field goals, they were unable to hold the lead in the second half. They tied the game at 20 on a fourth-quarter touchdown run, James Wilder's first of the year, but immediately allowed the Chiefs to drive the length of the field for the winning touchdown. The sloppily played game included four fumbles, six sacks, two interceptions, and 17 penalties for 146 yards. Art Still contributed three of the Chiefs' five sacks.|$|E
5|$|Vick {{chose to}} wear #8 {{as a tribute}} to <b>Steve</b> <b>Young,</b> {{although}} several days later he decided to change it to #1, as #7 was already taken by Geno Smith. Vick became the first quarterback in franchise history to wear the number. During Week 5 against the San Diego Chargers, Vick came in relief of a struggling Geno Smith following halftime and finished the game with 47 passing yards as the Jets were shut out by the Chargers, 31–0. After seven consecutive losses, Rex Ryan named Vick the starter over Smith for the Week 9 game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Vick became the first quarterback to reach 6,000 rushing yards during Week 10, in a 20–13 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, which was one of three games that Vick started for the season.|$|E
5|$|When the Buccaneers {{selected}} University of Miami quarterback Vinny Testaverde first {{overall in}} the 1987 NFL Draft, starting quarterback <b>Steve</b> <b>Young</b> became expendable. He {{was traded to the}} 49ers on April 24, 1987. The 49ers were concerned about the health of Joe Montana, and were preparing for the possibility that he might not recover from back surgery. The Buccaneers received 2nd and 4th round draft picks in the trade, picks 50 and 106 overall, which they used to draft University of Miami linebacker Winston Moss and Arizona State wide receiver Bruce Hill. They also received an unspecified amount of cash in the deal. Young would spend the final 13 years of his career with the 49ers, a stint which would help him secure a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005.|$|E

50|$|Kitzi later made a guest {{appearance}} in Bloom County in 1985, although the character had been altered to be <b>Steve's</b> <b>younger</b> sister {{rather than his}} girlfriend (jailed for protesting Apartheid, even though their sorority doesn't even admit blacks).|$|R
2500|$|<b>Steve's</b> <b>younger</b> brother John was {{involved}} as flute player and second guitarist in his 1970s bands. [...] John has often appeared as musician and collaborator on his more recent work, particularly on Sketches of Satie (2000), arranged for flute and guitar.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the losing}} {{and the poor}} attendance, the Buccaneers {{were one of the}} NFL's most {{profitable}} teams for most of Culverhouse's ownership. In 1989, only the Chicago Bears had higher profits than the 5–11 Buccaneers, who profited $6.3 million with the league's second-lowest payroll, while the Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers lost $16.2 million. The team attributed their low salaries to the players' youth, stating that it was the coaches who had made the decision to use younger players, who drew lower salaries than veterans. This contributed to the perception that Culverhouse was not committed to fielding a quality team, although the rookie contracts he gave to Vinny Testaverde and Paul Gruber were so high as to upset other team owners, while he made Ray Perkins one of the five highest-paid NFL head coaches. He also offered Bill Parcells $6.5 million to coach the team, offered draft pick Bo Jackson a five-year, $7 million contract that was at the time the highest in NFL history for a rookie, paid Keith McCants an NFL-record $2.5 million signing bonus, and paid <b>Steve</b> <b>Young</b> $6 million in salary, plus another $1 million for the buyout of his USFL contract.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers {{received}} a 2nd- and a 4th-round draft pick from the San Francisco 49ers {{in exchange for}} quarterback <b>Steve</b> <b>Young,</b> and a 2nd-round pick from the New England Patriots in exchange for guard Sean Farrell. They swapped 2nd-round picks with the Buffalo Bills, and also {{received a}} 4th-round pick in return. The Buccaneers' original 5th-round pick had been traded to the Patriots for a 6th-round pick the previous year. They received a 5th-round pick from New England {{in exchange for a}} 4th-round pick the following year, and a 5th-round pick from the Washington Redskins in exchange for the rights to quarterback Doug Williams. The Buccaneers' original 6th-round pick was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers in exchange for center Dan Turk, but they received a 6th-round pick from the San Diego Chargers as part of an earlier deal for linebacker Andy Hawkins. The original 8th-round pick was traded to the New York Jets in exchange for tackle Marvin Powell. Cornerback John Holt had been traded to the Indianapolis Colts in 1986 for the Colts' 1987 8th-round pick. Linebacker Rick DiBernardo was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for a 12th-round pick. Dan Sileo was {{signed as a free agent}} after the NCAA ruled that he had used up his college eligibility, but the league voided the agreement and declared that he must enter a draft. A special draft was held in which the Buccaneers selected him with a 1988 third-round pick.|$|E
