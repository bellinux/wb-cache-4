50|$|Metolachlor is {{produced}} from 2-ethyl-6-methylaniline (MEA) via condensation with methoxyacetone. The resulting imine is hydrogenated to give primarily the S-stereoisomeric amine. This secondary amine is acetylated with chloroacetylchloride. Because of the steric {{effects of the}} 2,6-disubstituted aniline, rotation about the aryl-C to N bond is restricted. Thus, both the (R)- and the (S)-enantiomers exist as atropisomers. Both atropisomers of (<b>S)-metolachlor</b> exhibit the same biological activity.|$|E

The experiments were established in the field according to a randomized complete block design with four repetitions in a 7 x 2 split-plot scheme. In the plots, five herbicide treatments were studied (<b>S-metolachlor</b> at 1. 44, 1. 92, and 2. 40 kg ha- 1, clomazone at 1. 20 kg ha- 1, and isoxaflutole at 0. 188 kg ha- 1), and two control treatments with no herbicide application. In the subplots, the presence or absence of sugar cane crop residue on the soil surface was evaluated. <b>S-metolachlor</b> efficacy was not hampered by either 14 or 20 t ha- 1 of sugar cane crop residue on the soil surface. When sugar cane crop residue was covering the soil surface, <b>S-metolachlor</b> at a rate of 1. 44 kg ha- 1 resulted in weed control similar at their larger rates, where as without the presence of crop residue, <b>S-metolachlor</b> controlled B. decumbens, D. horizontalis, and P. maximum at the rates of 1. 92, 1. 44, and 1. 92 kg ha- 1, respectively.

Preemergence treatments included <b>S-metolachlor</b> + fomesafen at 0. 91 + 0. 22, 1. 21 + 0. 28, 1. 52 + 0. 36, and 1. 82 + 0. 43 kg ha- 1 and <b>S-metolachlor</b> + metribuzin at 0. 55 + 0. 14 kg ha- 1. These treatments were applied alone or followed by a postemergence glyphosate application at 0. 88 kg ha- 1. Ratings were taken 2, 4 and 8 weeks after treatment. The study showed that <b>S-metolachlor</b> + fomesafen gave excellent early season control of common waterhemp at both Sabetha and Manhattan. <b>S-metolachlor</b> + fomesafen at the 1. 52 + 0. 36 kg ha- 1 rate gave greater weed control than <b>S-metolachlor</b> + metribuzin. A separate {{study was conducted to}} determine the competitiveness and fitness of a protox-resistant common waterhemp biotype. Protox-resistant and protox-susceptible biotypes of common waterhemp were grown under noncompetitive and competitive arrangements in the greenhouse. In the noncompetitive study a single plant of both biotypes was planted in 15 -cm-diam pots. Photosynthesis, leaf area, and plant biomass were measured 10, 20, 30, and 40 day after transplanting (DATP). In general, photosynthesis rate and plant biomass was similar between biotypes. However, the protox-resistant biotype had higher leaf area then the susceptible biotype at 20, 30, and 40 DATP.

40|$|The {{effect of}} three tillage {{implements}} (field cultivator, disk harrow, rotary harrow) {{on the soil}} incorporation of various herbicides and consequently on the efficacy of these herbicides against the weeds and on their selectivity on cotton, was evaluated in four field experiments conducted in Northern Greece during 2003 and 2004. All experimental plots were irrigated with sprinklers, immediately after the pre-emergence application of herbicides, while later all plots were irrigated with either drip irrigation or mobile sprinklers. The herbicide treatments consisted of a broadcast preplant-incorporated (PPI) application of <b>s-metolachlor</b> or trifluralin followed by pre-emergence (PRE) applied prometryn, a pre-emergence 38 cm band application of <b>s-metolachlor</b> + fluometuron and a broadcast PPI application of <b>s-metolachlor</b> followed by post-emergence applied trifloxysulfuron-sodium or pyrithiobac. The PPI application of <b>s-metolachlor</b> or trifluralin followed by PRE application of prometryn resulted the greatest control of redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.). The efficacy of herbicides against common lambsquarters and black nightshade was slightly reduced when they were incorporated into the soil with the rotary harrow. Cotton plant emergence, number of bolls, boll opening and cotton lint yield were not affected in most cases by the tillage implement. Cotton lint yield in plots irrigated with drip irrigation was higher or equal with plots irrigated with sprinklers. The effect of three tillage implements (field cultivator, disk harrow, rotary harrow) and various herbicides was also evaluated in two field experiments conducted in Northern Greece during 2006 and 2007. Herbicide treatments included the pre-plant incorporation of <b>s-metolachlor</b> + fluometuron, trifluralin + fluometuron, ethalfluralin, pendimethalin + fluometuron, fluometuron. Irrigation with sprinklers was not made after cotton sowing. Cotton lint yield in plots treated with preplant incorporated <b>s-metolachlor</b> + fluometuron was equal to plots treated with trifluralin + fluometuron or pendimethalin + fluometuron, but significantly higher than plots treated with ethalfluralin or fluometuron. The incorporation of herbicides in the soil with disk harrow or field cultivator compared to rotary harrow, provided higher efficacy against some weeds and similar effect on cotton plant emergence, number of bolls, bolls opening and cotton lint yield. In addition, the fossil-fuel and labor time requirements of disk harrow and field cultivator were {{lower than that of}} rotary harrow. The findings of this study showed that the herbicides trifluralin, <b>s-metolachlor</b> or pendimethalin in tank mix with fluometuron or prometryn should be used for effective control of broad leaved weeds in cotton. Finally, drip irrigation combined with the PPI application of <b>s-metolachlor</b> or pendimethalin in tank mix with fluometuron and incorporated in the soil with field cultivator or disk harrow should be the first choice of cotton growers in integrated crop management systems. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTR ACT: Sorption {{coefficients}} were evaluated for pyroxasulfone, <b>s-metolachlor,</b> and dimethenamid-p across 25 soil types with different chemical and physical properties {{to better understand}} how soil properties influence the binding of pyroxasulfone in different soils. Sorption {{coefficients were}} determined using a batch equilibrium method to evaluate relative differences in binding among the three herbicides. Based on water solubility values, we would have expected the relative order of binding to be dimethenamid-p (1450  mg L− 1 at 20 °C), <b>s-metolachlor</b> (530  mg L− 1 at 20 °C), and pyroxasulfone (3. 49  mg L− 1 at 20 °C) in order of increasing binding. However, when sorption coefficients were calculated, we observed the order of pyroxasulfone = dimethenamid-p <b>s-metolachlor</b> {{in the order of}} increasing binding. The average Kd (sorption coefficient) values were 1. 7, 2. 3, and 4. 0  L kg− 1 for pyroxasulfone, dimethenamid-p, and <b>s-metolachlor,</b> respectively. Although dimethenamid-p has water solubility values that are over 400 times greater than pyroxasulfone, there was no statistical difference in binding between pyroxasulfone and dimethenamid-p. <b>s-Metolachlor</b> binding was statistically greater than both pyroxasulfone and dimethen-amid-p. Across all soil chemical and physical properties, sorption coefficients for all three herbicides were highly and statistically correlated to soil organic matter. Sand and silt were also statistically correlated to binding, although these correlations could be explained by the high correlation of organic matter to these properties. Evaluation of sorption coefficients indicates that pyroxasulfone is most prevalent in the soil solution where herbicides are available for plant uptake. Reduced soil binding and greater activity at the target site could contribute to comparable weed control efficacies of pyroxasulfone even whe...|$|E
