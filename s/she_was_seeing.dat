5|$|Susan is {{identified}} as Mike's bride in the sixth season premiere. Her marriage to Mike destroys her friendship with Katherine. After the wedding, Julie is strangled outside of Susan's home. Julie slips into a coma following her attack. While {{waiting for her to}} awaken, Susan learns that Julie had dropped out of medical school, was involved with a married man, and had a pregnancy scare before her attack. When Julie awakens, she refuses to identify the married man <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing.</b> Later in the season, Julie's attacker is revealed to be Eddie Orlofsky (Josh Zuckerman), a local young adult who is also responsible for a handful of murders in Fairview. Prior to the attack, Susan had taken Eddie on as an art student and he developed a crush on her. When he discovered that she was remarrying Mike and that she did not see him as a romantic suitor, he attacked Julie, mistaking her for Susan.|$|E
25|$|A further set {{of copies}} were made between 1909 and 1911 by Christiana Herringham (Lady Herringham) {{and a group}} of {{students}} from the Calcutta School of Art that included the future Indian Modernist painter Nandalal Bose. The copies were published in full colour as the first publication of London's fledgling India Society. More than the earlier copies, these aimed to fill in holes and damage to recreate the original condition rather than record the state of the paintings as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> them. According to one writer, unlike the paintings created by her predecessors Griffiths and Gill, whose copies were influenced by British Victorian styles of painting, those of the Herringham expedition preferred an 'Indian Renascence' aesthetic of the type pioneered by Abanindranath Tagore.|$|E
500|$|Matsuoka {{described}} the filming conditions as [...] "very harsh", {{but said that}} [...] "the film was completed thanks to the children" [...] and ended by praising the perseverance of Shintaro and Kuwajima. Shintaro Morimoto said that the scene where the warehouse caught fire [...] "was the scariest scene in the entire film". Fellow actor Maiko also said that when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> Shintaro and Marino acting like lovers, {{it reminded her of}} her [...] "first love".|$|E

500|$|The fall in Lynn in 1866 was one {{of several}} {{experiences}} Eddy associated with the development of mental healing. In the first edition of Science and Health (1875), she wrote that she had [...] "made our first discovery that science mentally applied would heal the sick" [...] in 1864, while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> Quimby, and in 1883 told the Boston Post that she had [...] "laid the foundations of mental healing" [...] in 1853, when she was practising homeopathy. Elsewhere in the first edition of Science and Health she attributed the discovery to her difficulties with chronic indigestion as a child. In other editions she attributes the same difficulties to someone else. Eddy first linked the fall in Lynn to Christian Science in 1871, in a letter to a prospective student: ...|$|E
500|$|Co-writer Howard Gordon {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Alex [...] and I made {{an effort}} to play to our own strength, which is character. We thought this was an {{interesting}} place to reiterate Mulder's quest for his sister. We set out to tell a simple abduction story, which was played out behind the shadows. We wanted to create an air of tension. With everything that happened, we wanted to explain what it could be. At every point, everything can be explained. Was she taken or killed by her boyfriend, who <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> against her mother's wishes? Is it Twin Peaks or an alien abduction? That was the theme of the show." [...] Gordon and Gansa were afraid that series creator Chris Carter would not like the script, but Carter liked the script and approved the episode they wrote.|$|E
2500|$|Second wave {{feminism}} brought {{greater awareness}} {{of child sexual abuse}} and violence against women, and made them public, political issues. Judith Lewis Herman, Harvard professor of psychiatry, wrote the first book ever on father-daughter incest when she discovered during her medical residency {{that a large number of}} the women <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> had been victims of father-daughter incest. Herman notes that her approach to her clinical experience grew out of her involvement in the civil rights movement. [...] Her second book Trauma and Recovery coined the term complex post-traumatic stress disorder and included child sexual abuse as a possible cause.|$|E

2500|$|With Brenda in Paris, Dylan starts {{spending}} {{a great deal}} of time with Kelly, helping her babysit her little sister and entering a doubles beach volleyball tournament with her. The two have a strictly physical affair, but Kelly ends it out of loyalty to Brenda. Upon returning from Paris, Dylan and Brenda reunite. This doesn't last long though, as Brenda (who also has had an affair) runs into the man <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> in Paris at a video store and starts seeing him behind Dylan's back. Dylan and Brenda break up, and Dylan heads straight for Kelly. This doesn't last long either -- after Brenda sees them on a date and gets angry at them, they take a step back from their potential relationship. Dylan, frustrated, takes a road trip to get away from them. When he returns, Kelly and Brenda tell him to make a choice. When Brenda is unable to show up when he invites both girls to see his father, he decides to choose Kelly.|$|E

De Lauretis also notes the ambiguity inherent in the title: <b>is</b> <b>she</b> imagining things, or <b>is</b> it that <b>she</b> must <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> things [...] - [...] are there things that <b>she</b> ought to <b>be</b> <b>seeing?</b> ...|$|R

60|$|Ellen looked up. A superbly built man {{leaned against}} the doorpost. Like most Texans, he was light haired and light eyed. His face was lined and hard. His long, sandy {{mustache}} hid his mouth and drooped with a curl. Spurred, booted, belted, packing a heavy gun low down on his hip, he gave Ellen an entirely new impression. Indeed, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> everything strangely.|$|E
