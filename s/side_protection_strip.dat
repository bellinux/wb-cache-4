The R5 GTL was also launched in 1976 with the 1289 cc engine from the R5 TS (with the power reduced to 42 bhp), the equipment specification of the R5 TL plus grey <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> <b>strips</b> and some features from the R5 TS {{such as the}} styled wheel rims, reversing lights, cigarette lighter, illuminated heater panel, and electric windscreen washers.|$|R

50|$|While the {{required}} eye protection varies by occupation, the safety provided can be generalized. Safety glasses provide protection from external debris, and should provide <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> via a wrap-around design or side shields.|$|R
50|$|The car also weighs {{more than}} last season's F2007 chassis due to rule changes which {{includes}} the gearbox which has {{to be used for}} four consecutive races, higher <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> around the drivers helmet etc.|$|R
50|$|The hybrid Sonata {{received}} top five-star {{ratings for}} overall crash <b>protection</b> and overall <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> {{as well as}} four-ratings for overall frontal protection.Safety features include antilock brakes, stability control, traction control, front side-impact airbags, full-length curtain airbags, and active front head restraints.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1979 {{excavations}} {{to obtain}} {{sand and gravel}} {{for the construction of}} Highway 560 created a pit some six meters below the water table. In 1986 it was decided by the Hennef town administration to create a lake, and embankments and <b>protection</b> <b>strips</b> were built. In 1990 trees were planted and landscaping was finished just as the highway was completed, producing the lake in its current form. The lake has been stocked with fish for anglers, but swimming and water sports are prohibited.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} a Dutch demonstration project concerning <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> for trucks. The {{aim of this}} project was to gain practical experience in: the purchase, fitting and maintenance of side protection; driving trucks with side protection; the fuel consumption of these trucks; and in any damage or accidents involving the vehicles in question. The project also included a practical test to determine the `subjective safety feelings' of cyclists and pedestrians in relation to trucks with <b>side</b> <b>protection.</b> For the project, 42 closed trucks and 27 articulated trucks belonging to the Van Gend & Loos transport company were employed. Over a period of six months, this transport company recorded the fuel consumption company recorded the fuel consumption of 28 trucks and 14 articulated trucks fitted with <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> and of vehicles {{that were part of}} a control group. At the same time, the road transport department of the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) carried out separate measurements under controlled conditions using an articulated truck and a closed truck. The study showed {{that in the case of}} closed trucks a saving of 4 - 5 % can be achieved. In the case of articulated trucks, a not insignificant saving of 1 - 2 % was determined...|$|R

50|$|The Portland class {{originally}} had 1 in armor for deck and <b>side</b> <b>protection,</b> but in construction {{they were given}} belt armor between 5 in (around the magazines) and 3.25 in in thickness. Armor on the bulkheads was between 2 in and 5.75 in; that on the deck was 2.5 in, the barbettes 1.5 in, the gunhouses 2.5 in, and the conning tower 1.25 in.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the complete vehicle weighs around 40,000 lbs and costs about $500,000 (three times more than a Humvee). The Bull prototypes had two side hatches at the front (meeting MRAP II specs), used mainly for emergency exits. This design gave more <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> than larger traditional doors. The Bull had no gun ports, but these could be added in the final production model.|$|R
50|$|Modern fell running {{trainers}} use light, non-waterproof {{material to}} eject water and dislodge peat after traversing boggy ground. While the trainer {{needs to be}} supple, to grip an uneven, slippery surface, a degree of <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> against rock and scree (loose stones) may be provided. Rubber studs have been the mode for two decades, preceded by ripple soles, spikes and the flat soled ‘pumps’ of the fifties.|$|R
40|$|The {{in-plane}} edge {{impact of}} composite plates, {{with or without}} a <b>protection</b> <b>strip,</b> is investigated. A computational analysis based on the Fast Fourier Transform technique is presented. The particular application of the present method is in the understanding of the foreign object damage problem of composite fan blades. The method is completely general and may be applied to the study of other stress wave propagation problems in a half space. Results indicate that for the protective strip to be effective in reducing impact stresses in the composite the thickness must be equal or greater than the impact contact dimension. Large interface shear stresses at the strip - composite boundary can be induced under impact...|$|R

50|$|The use of {{aluminum}} armor and {{the storage of}} large quantities of ammunition in the vehicle initially raised questions about its combat survivability. Spaced laminate belts and high hardness steel skirts {{have been added to}} improve the <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> of later versions, although this increases overall weight to 33 tons. In friendly fire incidents in Desert Storm, many crew members survived hits that resulted in total losses for lighter U.S. Marine Corps LAV-25 vehicles.|$|R

Absence of <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> of the boilers and internal aviation fuel stores [...] "doomed her to a blazing demise". These were inherent design flaws that were recognized when constructed but could not be remedied within the allowed tonnage.
