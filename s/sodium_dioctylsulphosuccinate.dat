40|$|The {{activities}} of miconazole and miconazole sulphosalicylate {{were evaluated by}} a contact test using strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli and Candida spp selected for their resistance. The results showed that killing of the organisms occured within a few minutes. Imidazole activity required a medium of low electrical conductivity and a pH of 5. 6. Greater sensitivity could be obtained with pretreatment of the microbial suspensions with <b>sodium</b> <b>dioctylsulphosuccinate.</b> Microorganisms tested in culture media with low electrical conductivity and at pH 5. 6 showed enhanced sensitivity to azoles with MIC values about 20 - 30 times lower than those obtained using control media. Practical implications {{of the use of}} topical drugs are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. and International Society of Chemotherapy. All rights reserved...|$|E
