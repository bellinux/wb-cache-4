40|$|Helium bubbles {{are one of}} {{the typical}} {{radiation}} microstructures in metals and alloys, significantly influencing their deformation behavior. However, the dynamic evolution of helium bubbles under straining is less explored so far. Here, by using in situ micromechanical testing inside a transmission electron microscope, we discover that the helium bubble not only can coalesce with adjacent bubbles, but also can split into several nanoscale bubbles under tension. Alignment of the splittings along a slip line can create a bubble-free channel, which appears softer, promotes shear localization, and accelerates the failure in the <b>shearing-off</b> mode. Detailed analyses unveil that the unexpected bubble fragmentation is mediated by the combination of dislocation cutting and internal surface diffusion, which is an alternative microdamage mechanism of helium irradiated copper besides the bubble coalescence.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of collision dynamics of nanoparticles {{for a broad}} range of impact factors and collision speeds is presented. The investigation is based on molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with the Lennard-Jones interaction potential thus making the results applicable for {{a broad range of}} material properties. Identification criteria are used to classify the collision dynamics into different collision modes and submodes. Detailed analysis of the collision processes reveals the existence of coalescence and stretching separation modes, which are further classified according to their dynamics into sticking; slide-and-locking; droplet; normal stretching separation; stretching separation with satellite droplets; and <b>shearing-off</b> modes. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with previous molecular dynamic studies and analytical prediction models derived for macroscopic droplet collisions are also discussed. The investigation reveals that the reflexive separation mode, which has been observed in macroscopic droplet collisions, does not occur for nanoparticles consisting of 10 000 (or less) atoms...|$|E
40|$|In two-fluid model, the {{interfacial}} area concentration (IAC) {{is an important}} parameter that characterizes the interaction of two-phases at the interface. The accuracy of IAC modeling and local measurements largely affects the efficiency of designing and assessing two-phase flow systems. The prediction of the dynamical evolution of IAC {{is one of the}} most challenging tasks in research and application. This thesis is focused on developing advanced local measurement techniques to obtain reliable two-phase parameters and implementing efficient theoretical models for IAC source and sink terms in a two-group {{interfacial area}} transport equation based on experiments. In this study, an advanced local measurement technique using a four-sensor conductivity probe has been presented for obtaining IAC in air-water flows. It extends the existing conductivity probe method to slug and churn-turbulent flows with a unified probe design and comprehensive signal processing system. Sophisticated algorithm and software have been implemented that is robust in handling most practical conditions with high reliability. Systematic analyses on the issues of probe applications and benchmarks have been performed. The improved four-sensor method has also been applied to flow conditions with significant local recirculation, which was considered the most challenging situation for local measurement in two-phase flow. Using the well-established instrumentation, solid databases for a two-inch air-water loop have been built with sufficient information on the axial development and the radial distribution of the local parameters. Mechanistic models of major fluid particle interaction phenomena involving two bubble groups have been proposed, including the <b>shearing-off</b> of small bubbles from slug/cap bubbles, the wake entrainment of group- 1 bubble into group- 2 bubble, the wake acceleration and coalescence between group- 2 bubbles, and the breakup of group- 2 bubbles due to surface instability. Prediction of IAC evolution using the one-dimensional two-group transport equation and evaluation with experimental results are performed. The proposed model predicts a smooth transition across the bubbly-to-slug flow regime boundary and demonstrates mechanistic interactions for cap/slug bubble generation and developing processes. The finalized two-group interfacial area transport equation successfully covers a wide range from bubbly, slug, to churn turbulent flow regimes for adiabatic air-water upward flow in moderate diameter pipes. ...|$|E
40|$|To {{provide a}} closure {{relation}} for interfacial area {{concentration in the}} two-fluid model, two-group interfacial area transport equation is established, by which the change of interfacial area concentration can be dynamically predicted. In the current study, the sources/sinks in the two-group formulation are developed particularly for a confined test section by analytical modeling of the complicated intra-group and inter-group bubble transport based on five bubble interaction mechanisms. Group 1 bubbles include spherical/distorted bubbles while Group 2 are cap/slug/churn-turbulent bubbles. The modeled mechanisms are bubble coalescence due to random collision driven by turbulent eddies, bubble coalescence through wake entrainment, bubble breakup due to turbulent impact, large bubble breakup due to surface instability, and small bubble <b>shearing-off</b> at the rim of large bubbles. Due to the significant differences of the bubble size and shape, a systematic and comprehensive integral approach is applied in the modeling process. ^ Experiments are performed to build a reliable database in an existing test section designed for distortion-free visualization of flow regime transitions. To determine flow conditions for the local measurements, flow regime transitions are identified by flow visualization. In total, 13 flow conditions are examined in cap-turbulent/churn-turbulent flow. The local two-phase flow parameters for each group of bubbles, such as void fraction, interfacial velocity, interfacial area concentration, etc., are acquired by four-sensor conductivity probes. ^ Furthermore, the two-group interfacial area transport equation is evaluated against the experimental data in 11 bubbly and 13 cap-turbulent/churn-turbulent flow conditions. The adjustable model coefficients are determined based on a systematic approach by accounting for the previous one-group transport equation study, the current inter-group void transport and two-group interfacial area concentration transport. The average relative difference for the total interfacial area concentration between the experimental data and the model predictions in the 24 flow conditions is 6. 68 %. For the 13 cap-turbulent/churn-turbulent flow, the average relative errors of interfacial area for Group 1 and Group 2 bubbles are 7. 54 % and 21. 15 %, respectively. The evaluation results demonstrate that the two-group interfacial area transport equation focused on the current confined test section has the capability to well predict the interfacial area concentration in the bubbly, cap-turbulent flow, and churn-turbulent flow regimes. ...|$|E
40|$|The closure {{relations}} for the two-group interfacial area transport equation (LATE) by which the changes of interfacial area concentration can be dynamically modeled are set forth in this thesis for the case of large diameter pipes. In the two-group formulation, the sources and sink terms are established by mechanistic modeling of the intra-group and inter-group transport of the bubbles based on five major bubble interaction mechanisms. These mechanisms are bubble coalescence {{as a result of}} random collision, RC, wake entrainment, WE, bubble break-up due to turbulent impact, TI, small bubble <b>shearing-off</b> of large bubbles, SO, and bubble break-up due to surface instability for large bubbles, SI. ^ The models developed are supported by experiments using a four-sensor conductivity probe in large diameter test sections, 10. 16 cm and 15. 24 cm in diameter. A total of 31 different flow conditions under atmospheric pressure are examined in the bubbly to churn-turbulent flow regimes. The local flow parameters measured by the multi-sensor conductivity probe include the local time-averaged void fraction, interfacial area concentration, bubble Sauter mean diameter, interfacial velocity, and interface frequency for the two groups of bubbles. The model is evaluated against the extensive database and good agreement is obtained between the model predictions and the experimental data. The average error based on the total interfacial area concentration is around 7. 0 % for interfacial area concentration in both test sections. ^ Recirculation in the large pipes is given special treatment in the measurement analysis. Using upwards and downwards facing probes, information on the missing bubble signals is obtained which is used to correct the local data by either the Effective Bubble Number or Intrusiveness Factor Method. The correction to void fraction is found to be about a 12 % increase in the local area averaged value, while interfacial area concentration may increase upwards of 60 % in the recirculation zones. Comparison of the model predictions with the corrected data are reasonably good. Scaling of the IATE and application of the newly developed models to smaller pipe sizes is also discussed with emphasis on the model dependencies on the length scales of the flow. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} tests were {{performed in a}} sand commercially known as # 2 Q-ROK to determine its response to loading. # 2 Q-ROK is a poorly-graded, clean silica sand composed of 99 % of quartz (SiO 2). Its specific gravity is 2. 65 and its maximum and minimum void ratios are 1. 03 and 0. 7, respectively. In the absence of crushing, the # 2 Q-ROK sand direct shear critical-state friction angle is 32. 8 ° and the ring shear critical-state friction angle is 29. 6 °. ^ One-dimensional compression tests were performed on samples compressed to a normal stress of 24, 851. 36 kPa for time periods ranging from 4 hours to 11 days. The maximum increment in relative breakage was 0. 02. Time effects did not {{play a significant role}} in particle crushing of # 2 Q-ROK sand. ^ The evolution of strength, particle gradation and morphology parameters with crushing were investigated by performing ring shear tests. The results of the ring shear tests showed that particle crushing increases significantly with shear displacement. Samples compressed to a normal stress of 300 kPa and sheared for displacements ranging from 0. 5 m to 11. 3 m showed a maximum increase in relative breakage of 0. 41. As crushing increased, the particle gradation of # 2 Q-ROK evolved from a poorly-graded sand to a more well-graded sand. Samples tested in the ring shear apparatus presented cycles of stress and vertical deformation, which indicated the occurrence of particle crushing. Each of these cycles started with a stage of contraction followed by a stage of dilation and a final stage of vertical displacement stabilization. As a result of the shear stress cycles observed with crushing, the mobilized friction angle of # 2 Q-ROK sand oscillated between 31 ° and 33 °. Ring shear tests performed on samples compressed to normal stresses ranging from 50 kPa to 100 kPa and sheared to displacements ranging from 20 m to 30 m indicated that the friction angle increased by approximately 3 ° at large shear displacements. The fluctuation of friction angle that initially ranged from 31 ° to 33 ° started to increase at approximately 7 m and 10 m for the samples compressed to 100 kPa and 50 kPa, respectively. At the end of these tests the mobilized friction angle ranged from 33 ° to 36 °. ^ Ring shear tests also showed that particle crushing developed only in a shear zone whose thickness ranged from 4. 4 mm to 4. 7 mm (6. 5 to 6. 9 times the D 50 of the original material). Considering a shear band thickness of 4. 55 mm, critical state was reached for the first time at a shear strain of 1648 % (75 mm of shear displacement). As the gradation of # 2 Q-ROK sand evolved with shear displacement, its maximum and minimum void ratios decreased to 0. 72 and 0. 36, respectively (shear displacement of 11. 3 m). Sieve analyses combined with particle morphology analyses indicated that larger particles were likely to be crushed by <b>shearing-off</b> of their asperities, whereas small particles, by particle splitting. ...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in multiphase flows in large diameter vertical pipes (typically with diameters greater that 100 mm) {{in the context of}} hydrocarbon production systems. There are strong indications that flows in such pipes differ greatly from those in smaller diameter pipes on which most of the prediction methodologies are based. In small diameter pipes, an important mechanism for the bubble flow to slug flow transition is the formation of void waves. This research reveal this wave growth and also predict the breakdown points from bubble-to-slug flow transition using Biesheuvel and Gorissen (1990) approximate void wave model based on Harwell small tube bubble flow experiments. As the gas velocity is further increased, the slug flow itself breaks down into churn flow by a process of flooding in the Taylor bubbles. In large diameter pipes, it appears that conventional slug flow does not occur; this is probably {{due to the fact that}} there is a size limit on spherical cap bubbles. Thus, this study reviews most of literatures in terms of bubble coalescence and breakup kernels in order to evaluate dynamic bubble size changes by applying population balance model. Unfortunately, these kernels have their own problems to be solved. Therefore we establish a simplified two-group bubble interaction model by taking into account mechanisms of large bubble <b>shearing-off</b> breakup and small bubble coalescence in large bubble wakes, respectively, assuming small bubbles do not coalesce to each other. In large diameter pipes, the bubble/slug and slug/churn transitions appear to be by-passed in favour of a direct transition from bubble to churn flow with increasing gas mass flux. Note that the churn flow studied here is emphasized by a continuous path for the gas phase. This study also describes work aimed at developing a phenomenological understanding of the bubble/churn and churn/annular transition regions in large diameter pipes. Investigation of the liquid transport mechanisms has led to the definition of two new flow regime transition criteria, namely liquid upflow potential and minimum entrained fraction. To estimate the bubble-to-churn flow transition, the liquid upflow potential of a churn flow at the particular local set of gas and liquid flow rates is estimated by using axial view experiments and the existing adiabatic equilibrium data. In churn flow, liquid upflow is achieved by the net upward flow in the film (bearing in mind that both upflow and downflow are occurring in the film, though the net value must be positive) and by droplet transport in the gas core. Once the Kutateladse flooding is reached, suggested by Pushkina and Sorokin (1969), then it is postulated that the transition to churn flow occurs. As the gas velocity is further increased, the flow rate of entrained drops in the gas core decreases to a minimum and then rises again. This minimum is observed to occur at a dimensionless gas velocity approximately equal to one and this serves as a possible criterion for the churn-to-annular flow transition. As a framework for prediction, an existing one-dimensional steady state modelling code (GRAMP 2) has been selected. This code takes account of regime changes and predicts void fraction and pressure gradient using phenomenological models. Work on connecting the void wave growth, bubble size evaluation and GRAMP 2 code for large diameter pipes will be the main target for the nearly future. In the meantime, CFD simulation is also being undertaken using a finite volume method based the STARCD software in order to numerically predict the evaluations of dynamic bubble size and flow regime changes in large diameter pipes.

40|$|During {{the summers}} of 1957 till 1959 {{geological}} investigations {{were carried out}} {{in the western part of}} the Dolomites (southern Alps), where these are separated from the central Alps by the Judicaria fault. A long time before the principal displacements occurred along this fault - late oligocene - early miocene its presence was indicated by a zone of weakness (lineament), which caused facies differences at both sides (e. g. Lombardian and Venetian facies) starting from the rhaetian. Even the permian boundary between Collio and volcanic series might be reduced to this zone of weakness. The development of facies in the Val-di-Non area allows many correlations with the well-known and much studied stratigraphy of the central Dolomites. During the upper-cretaceous and the eocene, the activity of the Judicaria zone is felt also in our area by breccias and conglomerates which developed parallel to this fault. The originally chaotic tectonic picture shows different directions offolding, dipping b-axes, and subhorizontal overthrusting; the area is cut by faults which demonstrate many different mechanisms of displacement. Curving of fault planes and sub-recent collapse structures of great extension are frequently met with. Thanks to the lucky circumstance, that the Judicaria fault is not running parallel to the trend of the midtertiary alpine foldings in the Val-di-Non area, an exact, relative dating of the various deformation phases could be established. Three mid-tertiary orogenic subphases, with very marked characteristics, appear to be responsible for the deformation pattern. The first subphase shows a gravitative decollement of the sedimentary epidermis from the rising central Alps towards the SSE. Secondly, the Judicaria fault originated as a steep normal fault, along which the southern Alps sank relatively to the central Alps, which continued their rising to enormous heights. Shortly after, a tonalitic magma made its way upwards, using mainly the previously formed Judicaria fault. In the adjoining south-alpine regions too, these three subphases may be found again, though the peri-adriatic fault - which the Judicaria fault forms part of - runs generally parallel with the alpine trend there, by which the relative age of the subphases becomes less conspicuous. The assumption of a central alpine geanticline offers a mechanically acceptable synthesis of these phenomena and their sequence. It was caused by the buoyancy of an increasing accumulation of relatively light mobile material at the base of the crust. This directly affirms van Bemmelen's views on the mechanism of the mid-tertiary orogeny in the eastern Alps (van Bemmelen 1958, 1960 b and 1960 c); he proposed a primary tectogenesis (rising of the central alpine geanticline), followed by a secondary tectogenesis at various levels in the crust (gravitative decollement of the epidermis from the flanks of the geanticline, vertical <b>shearing-off</b> of the southern Alps from the central Alps, and the lateral intrusion along this fault of granitic magma, which previously caused the rising of this geanticline). The sudden change of direction, displayed by the Judicaria fault (NNE-SSW) as a part of the periadriatic suture - the regular E-W extension is interrupted over a distance of 80 km - induced many authors to assume a sinistral strike-slip faulting along the Judicaria fault, by which the 'Dolomitic Unit' should have been shoved further northward than the 'Bergamasc Unit', which lagged behind. In the field, however, no traces are found of any accompanying (north-directed) foldings, nor of any sinistral torsion along the supposed strike-slip faults. This change of direction (Judicaria fault) of the periadriatic suture is to be regarded rather as a local adaption of this suture to a zone of weakness of the crust, which appears to be present there since triassic times, as may be concluded from the sedimentary history of the Judicaria zone. The paleomagnetic properties of the lower-permian volcanic series of Bolzano have been investigated. In most cases unstable directions of magnetization could be removed by progressive demagnetization. The stable direction of magnetization furnishes a lower-permian pole, situated at 118, 6 ° Wand 51, 4 ° N; this position deviates considerably from the average pole position, as obtained from other European permian samples. This deviation might be due to geotectonic cause...|$|E
