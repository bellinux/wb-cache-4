500|$|Jethro Tull's {{frontman}} {{and songwriter}} Ian Anderson {{was surprised when}} critics called the band's previous album, Aqualung (1971), a [...] "concept album". He rejected this, thinking {{it was simply a}} collection of songs, so in response decided to [...] "come up with <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> is the mother of all concept albums". Taking the surreal English humour of Monty Python as an influence, he began to write a piece that would combine complex music with a sense of humour, with the idea it would poke light-hearted fun at the band, the audience, and the music critics. He also intended to satirise the progressive rock genre that was popular at the time.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s {{a number of}} American {{painters}} began to adapt the imagery and motifs of comic strips. Roy Lichtenstein made drawings of comic strip characters in 1958. Andy Warhol produced his earliest paintings in the style in 1960. Lichtenstein, unaware of Warhol's work, produced Look Mickey and Popeye in 1961. Although Warhol had produced silkscreens of comic strips and of other pop art subjects, he supposedly relegated himself to Campbell's Soup Cans as a subject {{at the time to}} avoid competing with the more finished style of comics by Lichtenstein. He once said [...] "I've got to do <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> will have a lot of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist, that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly what they're doing." ...|$|E
500|$|Black Beauty was {{originally}} released only in Japan in 1973. It contained four side-long tracks spread across a double album, grouping the songs as medleys titled [...] "Black Beauty Part I", [...] "Black Beauty Part II", and so on, {{all of which}} credited Davis as the composer. He {{did not want the}} actual segments specified on the track listing out of a distaste for critics and listeners who arduously analyzed his music; according to DeJohnette's wife Lydia, [...] "Miles really felt that critics and people spent too much time in their mental mind, analyzing and talking for hours about <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> just is." [...] Columbia spent several years identifying some of the individual compositions to ensure royalty payment for the actual composers. The Japanese release also mistakenly credited Michael Henderson—Davis' other bassist during this period—rather than Holland in the liner notes.|$|E

500|$|During {{the comic}} book phase of his career, Lichtenstein often {{slightly}} altered the colorization of the original source. According to Marco Livingstone, his early comic subjects comprise a [...] "loose and improvised style clearly derived from de Kooning." [...] Art historian Jonathan Fineberg describes a Lichtenstein painting of 1960 as an [...] "...abstract expressionist picture with Mickey Mouse in it, related stylistically to the de Kooning Women". When Leo Castelli saw both Lichtenstein's and Warhol's large comic strip-based works, he elected to show only Lichtenstein's, causing Warhol to create the Campbell's Soup Cans series to avoid competing with the more refined style of comics Lichtenstein was then producing. He once said [...] "I've got to do <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> {{will have a lot}} of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist, that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly what they're doing." [...] Lichtenstein's foray into comics led to the abandonment of the topic by Warhol. Although Lichtenstein continued to work with comic sources, after 1961 he avoided the easily identified sources like Popeye and Mickey Mouse.|$|E
500|$|The {{military}} {{ordered a}} flight test using liquid rather than solid fuel in early 1942. Upon the United States' {{entry into the}} Second World War in December 1941, the Group realized they could be drafted directly into military service if they failed to provide viable JATO technology for the military. Informed by their left-wing politics, aiding the war effort against Nazi Germany and the Axis powers was {{as much of a}} moral vocation to Parsons, Forman and Malina as it was a practical one. Parsons, Summerfield and the GALCIT workers focused on the task and found success with a combination of gasoline with red fuming nitric acid as its oxidizer; the latter, suggested by Parsons, was an effective substitute for liquid oxygen. The testing of this fuel resulted in another calamity, when the testing rocket motor exploded; the fire, containing iron shed fragments and shrapnel, inexplicably left the experimenters unscathed. Malina solved the problem by replacing the gasoline with aniline, resulting in a successful test launch of a JATO-equipped A-20A plane at the Muroc Auxiliary Air Field in the Mojave Desert. It provided five times more thrust [...] than GALCIT-27, and again reduced takeoff distance by 30%; Malina wrote to his parents that [...] "We now have <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> works and {{we should be able to}} help give the Fascists hell!" ...|$|E

[...] McKinnon said the song is a [...] "more personal song [...] It discusses how the choices I've made to put my best foot forward in my career, in a sense, have really done damage to my personal life." [...] Both [...] "You Be Tails, I'll Be Sonic" [...] and [...] "Out of Time" [...] talk about [...] "how I feel like I'm doing what I want with my life, but I think, [...] "Wow, I just did <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> affected me."" [...] "Out of Time" [...] {{was also one of}} the first songs written for the album, and was written while the band was in Australia. McKinnon said the song was the most personal on the record. Skaff had a major hand in writing [...] "If I Leave". The song describes [...] "different things you got through being on the road" [...] and [...] "a relationship ending when you're not really around enough to actually take care of it in person." [...] On being asked whether he knew it would be the final song on the album, McKinnon said [...] "It just felt right [...] seemed like a good ending".|$|E

[...] In February 1962, Lichtenstein displayed at a sold-out exhibition of cartoon pictures at Leo Castelli's eponymous Leo Castelli Gallery, ending the possibility of Warhol exhibiting his own cartoon paintings. Castelli had visited Warhol's gallery in 1961 and said that the work he saw there was too similar to Lichtenstein's, although Warhol's and Lichtenstein's comic artwork differed in subject and techniques (e.g., Warhol's comic-strip figures were humorous pop culture caricatures such as Popeye, while Lichtenstein's were generally of stereotypical hero and heroines, inspired by comic strips devoted to adventure and romance). Castelli chose not to represent both artists at that time, but he would, in 1964, exhibit Warhol works such as reproductions of Campbell's Tomato Juice Box, 1964 (pictured above, left), and Brillo Soap Boxes. He would again exhibit Warhol's work in 1966. Lichtenstein's 1962 show was quickly followed by Wayne Thiebaud's April 17, 1962 one-man show at the Allan Stone Gallery featuring all-American foods, which agitated Warhol as he felt it jeopardized his own food-related soup can works. Warhol was considering returning to the Bodley gallery, but the Bodley's director did not like his pop art works. In 1961, Warhol was offered a three-man show by Allan Stone at the latter's 18 East 82nd Street Gallery with Rosenquist and Robert Indiana, but all three were insulted by this proposition.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{noted for its}} [...] "dry, sterile" [...] production. Rasmussen said that was not his intention, as he tried for an ambient sound similar to the {{previous}} two albums. He was not present during the album's mixing, for which Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero had been hired beforehand. Rasmussen felt that, in his absence from the mixing process, Thompson and Barbiero ended up using only the close microphones on the mix {{and none of the}} room microphones, thus causing the [...] "clicking", thin drum sound. Popoff noted that because of the strange production, the bass guitar was nearly inaudible, while the guitars sounded [...] "strangled mechanistic". He saw the [...] "synthetic" [...] percussion as another reason for the album's compressed sound. The sound has nearly-inaudible bass guitar, which Rasmussen claims was ordered by Hetfield and Ulrich after hearing the initial mixes, resulting in his belief that [...] "Jason Newsted, [...] Toby Wright and I are probably the only people who know what the bass parts actually sounded like on that album". Thompson similarly blamed Ulrich for the inaudible bass, stating that Ulrich ordered him to remove the bass from the mix. In their defense, Hetfield and Ulrich said that most of Newsted's bass lines closely followed the rhythm guitar lines {{to the point of being}} indiscernible from each other. A lack of direction is also partly to blame; since the album was largely produced by the band, there was no one present in the studio to guide the band's new bassist and tell him what was expected of him, something a producer would typically do. Newsted was not satisfied with the final mixes: [...] "The Justice album wasn't <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> felt good for me, because you really can't hear the bass." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Princess chose her {{dressing}} style based {{on both the}} Royal Family's demands and popular modern styles in Britain, and developed her personal trend of fashion. While on diplomatic trips, her numerous clothes and attire were chosen to match the destination countries' costumes, and while off-duty she used to wear loose jackets and jumpers. [...] "She was always very thoughtful about how her clothes would be interpreted, it was <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> mattered to her," [...] stated Anna Harvey, a former editor of Vogue and the Princess's fashion mentor. David Sassoon, one of the designers who worked with Diana, believed that she had [...] "broken the rules" [...] with trying new styles. Diana chose not to practice some of the royal methods for clothing including putting aside the tradition of wearing gloves as she believed it would prevent direct connection with the people she met, such as those affected by serious diseases like AIDS patients. She used to wear certain types of ensembles and clothes at charity events which would also match the mentality of the people she would meet, for instance wearing colourful dresses and [...] "jangling jewels" [...] so she could easily play with children at hospitals. According to Donatella Versace who had closely worked with the Princess alongside her brother, Diana's interest and sense of curiosity in fashion grew significantly after her separation from Charles.

2500|$|Lucky and Luke start a {{slow process}} of {{reconciling}} when Luke kidnaps Lucky to an abandoned cabin and Lucky watches Luke distressfully dream of the rape while suffering from a delirious fever following a wolf trap accident. Lucky's relationship with his mother becomes further strained in December 1998 when he and Nikolas are told that Stefan Cassadine (Nichols) is Nikolas's father, not the presumed-dead Stavros Cassadine, and Laura had kept the secret. Lucky and Nikolas begin to bond over the betrayal of their respective families. Lucky's estrangement with his parents adds to his newfound open-mindedness about Nikolas, as Jackson told Soap Opera Magazine: [...] "Lucky's been {{trying to change the}} way he looks at things, to not become Luke. That's part of the process – not having the same relationship with Nikolas that Luke has with Stefan. (...) He's trying to find his own Spencer." [...] The former enemies become friends, a sign of Lucky's growth of character. Actress Genie Francis (Laura) explained to Soap Opera Digest in April 1999: [...] "It's huge, absolutely huge. (It's) <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> seemed impossible, but Lucky surprises [...] with his big heart and his maturity." [...] In the same interview, Guza described the acceptance Lucky had come to have about his parents, recounting scenes where Lucky bonds with each. Guza explained: [...] "They still have a ways to go, {{but the important thing is}} they're making the inroads now. (...)

2500|$|During Nancy's {{relationship}} with Jake Dean, Nancy's character was rapidly transformed {{due to her}} abuse {{at the hands of}} Jake. Fox told a journalist from OK! that when the relationship begins Jake is [...] "very controlling" [...] towards Nancy and he takes away [...] "all the things that made Nancy Nancy – the way she was opinionated and outspoken". She explained that during the storyline Nancy acts out of character which she found challenging to portray. She added that Nancy's abuse at the hands of Jake is psychological abuse rather than physical abuse. Sacre explained that Nancy wants to call off the wedding but Jake [...] "dismisses her concerns and insists the wedding goes ahead. He's kind of bulldozing his way through it all". He added that Jake Nancy still does not feel the wedding is right after he makes the arrangements but Jake still [...] "keeps on pushing and pushing and she gives in". Sacre said that Nancy regrets marrying Jake as soon as she has gone through with the wedding. Jake [...] "ends up trying to force himself on her on their wedding night". Sacre commented that in reaction to this Jake [...] "plays the victim and tries to blame Nancy for what's happened". The actor revealed that while Jake is in [...] "a desperate state" [...] he accidentally tells Nancy that he made allegations that she was having a sexual {{relationship with}} a pupil. Nancy is [...] "incensed", and Fox explained that this revelation is the [...] "final straw" [...] for Nancy who declares the marriage is over as this admission [...] "really shows Jake’s true colours" [...] to her. Fox stated that she and the production team were careful not to have the character return to her previous self, saying: [...] "We've tried really hard to make sure that Nancy didn't just snap back into her old self after the whole Jake incident last year. There's always a bit of darkness with her. That's <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> annoys me in soap, when something really dramatic happens to a character and they forget about it a couple of weeks later".|$|E
