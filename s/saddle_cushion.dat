2500|$|The Mishnah {{interpreted}} {{the prohibition of}} animals working in [...] (20:10 in the NJPS) to teach that on the Sabbath, animals could wear their tethers, and their caretakers could lead them by their tethers and sprinkle or immerse them with water. The Mishnah taught that a donkey could {{go out with a}} <b>saddle</b> <b>cushion</b> tied to it, rams strapped, ewes covered, and goats with their udders tied. Rabbi Jose forbade all these, except covering ewes. Rabbi Judah allowed goats to go out with their udders tied to dry, but not to save their milk. The Mishnah taught that animals could not go out with a pad tied to their tails. A driver could not tie camels together and pull one of them, but a driver could take the leads of several camels in hand and pull them. The Mishnah prohibited donkeys with untied cushions, bells, ladder–shaped yokes, or thongs around their feet; fowls with ribbons or leg straps; rams with wagons; ewes protected by wood chips in their noses; calves with little yokes; and cows with hedgehog skins or straps between their horns. The Mishnah reported that Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah's cow used to go out with a thong between its horns, but without the consent of the Rabbis.|$|E
40|$|Icelandic horse riding {{practices}} aim {{to place}} the rider further caudally on the horse’s back than in English riding, claiming that a weight shift toward the hindquarters improves {{the quality of the}} tölt (e. g. giving the shoulder more freedom to move). This study compared saddle pressure patterns and the effects on limb kinetics and kinematics of three saddles: an Icelandic saddle (SIcel, lowest point of seat in the hind part of the saddle), a treeless <b>saddle</b> <b>cushion</b> (SCush) and a dressage-style saddle (SDres). Twelve Icelandic horses were ridden with SIcel, SCush and SDres on an instrumented treadmill at walk and tölt. Saddle pressure, limb forces and kinematics were recorded simultaneously. With SCush, pressure was highest under the front part of the saddle, whereas the saddles with trees had more pressure under the hind area. The saddles had no influence on the motion patterns of the limbs. The slight weight shift to the rear with SCush and SIcel may be explained by the more caudal position of the rider relative to the horse’s back...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Compared to most equine horse breeds {{which are}} able to walk, trot and canter /gallop, the gait {{repertoire}} of the Icelandic horses additionally includes the lateral gait tölt and frequently also the pace. With respect to the tölt gait, special shoeing, saddling and riding techniques {{have been developed for}} Icelandic horses in order to enhance its expressiveness and regularity. Toes are left unnaturally long and heavy shoes and paddings, as well as weighted boots are used to enforce the individual gait predisposition. For the same reason, the rider is placed more caudally to the horse's centre of mass as compared to other riding techniques. The biomechanical impact of these methods on the health of the locomotor system has so far never been subject of systematic research. Objectives. The aims of the presented study are (1) to describe the kinetic and kinematic characteristics of the tölt performed on a treadmill, (2) to understand the mechanical consequences of shoeing manipulation (long hooves, weighted boots) on the loading and protraction movement of the limbs, as well as (3) to study the pressure distribution and effects on the gait pattern of 3 different saddle types used for riding Icelandic horses. Materials and methods. Gait analysis was carried out in 13 Icelandic horses at walk and at slow and medium tölting and trotting speeds on a high-speed treadmill instrumented for measuring vertical ground reaction forces as well as temporal and spatial gait variables. Kinematic data of horse, rider and saddle were measured simultaneously. Gait analysis was first carried out with high, long hooves (SH) without and in combination with weighted boots (ad aim (2)). Afterwards, horses were re-shod according to current horseshoeing standards (SN) and gait analysis was repeated (ad aims (1) and (2)). In a second trial, horses were additionally equipped with a pressure sensitive saddle mat and were ridden with a dressage-like saddle (SDres), an Icelandic saddle (Slcel) and a <b>saddle</b> <b>cushion</b> (SCush) in the standard saddle position (ad aim 3). Results and conclusions. Compared to trot at the same speed, tölting horses had a higher stride rate and lower stride impulses. At the tölt loading of the forelimbs was increased in form of higher peak vertical forces (Fzpeak) due to shorter relative stance durations (StDrel). Conversely, in the hindlimbs, longer StDrel resulted in lower Fzpeak. Despite the higher head-neck position at tölt, there was no measurable shift in weight to the hindlimbs. Footfall rhythm was in most horses laterally coupled at the tölt and frequently had a slight fourbeat and a very short suspension phase at trot; underlining the fact that performance of correct gaits in Icelandic horses needs special training. Gait performance as it is currently judged in competition could be improved using a shoeing with SH, resulting in a 21 ± 5 mm longer dorsal hoof wall, but also a weight gain of 273 ± 50 g at the distal limb due to heavier shoeing material. Compared to SN, SH led to a lower stride rate, a longer stride length and a higher, but not wider, forelimb protraction arc, which were also positively associated with speed. At the tölt, the footfall rhythm showed less tendency to lateral couplets and at the trot, the suspension phase was longer. However, on the long term, SH may have negative implications for the health of the palmar structures of the distal foot by increased limb impulses, higher torques at breakover (up to 20...|$|E
50|$|Though {{some people}} begin riding bareback before they learn with a saddle, {{it is usually}} {{recommended}} to first learn in a saddle without stirrups, as the rider is still helped in obtaining correct position by the pommel and cantle, but {{is not able to}} use the stirrups as a crutch for poor balance or position. It is also easier on the horse's back to have the support of a <b>saddle</b> to <b>cushion</b> the action of an unbalanced rider.|$|R

40|$|With the {{intention}} of limiting the weight on horses’ backs and guaranteeing maximal freedom of movement, commonly used racing saddles are small and have minimal <b>cushioning.</b> Poor <b>saddle</b> <b>cushioning</b> may limit performance or even affect soundness of the back. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure the pressure under an average racing saddle ridden by a jockey at racing speed. Saddle pressure using a medium-sized racing saddle (length 37 cm, weight 450 g) was measured in five actively racing Thoroughbred horses. All horses were trained at the same facility and ridden by their usual professional jockey, weighing 60 kg. The horses were ridden on a race track at canter (mean velocity, V 1 ± standard deviation, SD: 7. 7 ± 0. 4 m/s) and gallop (V 2 ± SD: 14. 0 ± 0. 7 m/s). Maximal pressure was 134 kPa at V 1 and 116 kPa at V 2. Mean peak pressure was 73. 6 kPa at V 1 and 54. 8 kPa at V 2. The maximal total force did not differ between the two velocities and was approximately twice the jockey’s bodyweight. The centre of pressure lateral range of motion differed significantly, with excursions of 23 mm at V 1 and 37 mm at V 2; longitudinal excursion was 13 mm for V 1 and 14 mm for V 2. The highest pressure (> 35 kPa) was always localised along the spinous processes over an average length of 12. 5 cm. It was concluded that racing saddles exert high peak pressures over bony prominences known to be sensitive to pressure...|$|R

6000|$|At three P.M. we left Al-Zaribah, {{travelling}} {{towards the}} South-West, and a wondrously picturesque scene met the eye. Crowds hurried along, habited in the pilgrim-garb, whose whiteness contrasted strangely with their black skins; their newly shaven heads glistening in the sun, and their {{long black hair}} streaming in the wind. The rocks rang with shouts of Labbayk! Labbayk! At a pass we fell in with the Wahhabis, accompanying the Baghdad Caravan, screaming “Here am I”; and, guided by a large loud kettle-drum, they followed in double file the camel of a standard-bearer, whose green flag bore in huge white letters the formula of the Moslem creed. They were wild-looking mountaineers, dark and fierce, with hair twisted into thin Dalik or plaits: each was armed with a long spear, a matchlock, or a dagger. They were seated upon coarse wooden <b>saddles,</b> without <b>cushions</b> or stirrups, a fine saddle-cloth alone denoting a ...|$|R
5000|$|Panels: {{the part}} of an English <b>saddle</b> which {{provides}} <b>cushioning</b> between the horse's back and the saddle, and allows adjustment in fitting the saddle to the horse. Also important in keeping the saddle balanced for the rider. Often stuffed with wool or foam flocking, or maintained by sealed air pockets. The panels under the cantle are called the [...] "rear panels." [...] Those {{at the front of}} the saddle are called the [...] "front panels." [...] However, the rear and front panels are one continuous unit, which can be seen if the saddle is flipped over. The saddle has two panels total, one on each side of the horse's spine.|$|R
25|$|Saddles also {{vary with}} rider preference, from the {{cushioned}} ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow {{more room for}} leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more <b>cushioned</b> <b>saddle</b> is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist {{for male and female}} cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies and sit bone width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men. Suspension seat posts and seat springs provide comfort by absorbing shock but can add to the overall weight of the bicycle.|$|R
