High angle-of-attack flight testing a high-risk and very expensive endeavor in manned aircraft, and wind tunnel testing to duplicate dynamic maneuvers is extremely difficult. Another means to conduct agility fight research in a low-cost, low- risk environment has been sought. Construction of a scaled generic Navy fighter model, to be powered by ducted-fan engines and controlled by radio command, was begun.

40|$|There is an {{exhaustive}} {{amount of research}} done on vibration transmissibility. However {{there is a lack}} of information about shock transmissibility. There currently is no research or studies to prove how shock affects the contents of a unitized pallet load of products, until now. Millions of dollars in damages are pointlessly thrown away each year due to improper forklift handling of products. Similarly, agricultural products are highly susceptible to damages and bruising which leaves the product undesirable to consumers, leading to its eventual disposal. This paper aims to study exactly how agricultural products are damaged when a unitized pallet load is struck, dropped, or similarly mishandled by a mechanical forklift truck. The study utilized state of the art real time data recorders to analyze a variety of standardized shock tests commonly found in distribution test cycles published by ASTM and ISTA. Shock values have been recorded and compared to one another to determine exactly how and where products are being damaged. The study compared the <b>shock</b> <b>dampening</b> potential of full and half-sized pallet configurations. The study determined that the half sized pallet configuration has better potential to dampen mechanical handling in all axes than the full sized configuration. Likewise, the study has also determined that shock travels more in the direction that it was sustained. Lastly, the study has determined that the pallet facing the forklift truck is also considerably more likely to experience damaging levels of acceleration than the side facing away...|$|E

40|$|Are {{fluctuations}} in firms’ profitability risk {{a major cause}} of regular business cycles? We study this question within the framework of a heterogeneous-firm dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with fixed capital adjustment costs. In such a model, surprise increases of risk lead to a wait-and-see policy for investment at the firm level and a decrease in aggregate economic activity. We calibrate the model using German firm-level data with a broader sectoral, size and ownership coverage than comparable U. S. data sets. The use of these data enables us to provide robust lower and upper bound estimates for the size of firm-level risk fluctuations. We find that time-varying firm-level risk on its own is unlikely to be a major quantitative source of regular business cycle fluctuations. When we augment a model with only aggregate productivity shocks by time-varying risk, the risk <b>shocks</b> <b>dampen</b> the high contemporaneous correlations of the productivity-shock-only model, but do not alter the other unconditional business cycle properties. ...|$|R

Main results are as follows. First, in the three countries, following a positive shock on the interest rate, prices increase instead of decreasing, due to the immediate depreciation of the nominal exchange rate. The results thus exhibit an "exchange rate" puzzle conducing to the appearance of a "price-puzzle". Second, none channel is very powerful for the MPT in the three countries. Nevertheless, the exchange rate and the interest rate channels play a growing role over the recent period in Poland, compared with the same channels in the Czech Republic and Hungary.

Foot binding was a historical practice in China aimed at restricting {{the growth of}} female feet for aesthetic reasons. In a bound foot the shock-dampening function normally facilitated by the foot arches is withdrawn, resulting in the foot functioning as a rigid extension of the lower leg. An interesting question inspiring this study regards the nature of adaptation of the heel bone to this nonphysiological function using the parameters of cancellous bone anisotropy and 3 D fabric topology and a novel intertrabecular angle (ITA) analysis. We found that the trabecular microarchitecture of the normal heel bone, but not of the bound foot, adapts to function by increased anisotropy and preferred orientation of trabeculae. The anisotropic texture in the normal heel bone consistently follows the physiological stress trajectories. However, in the bound foot heel bone the characteristic anisotropy pattern fails to develop, reflecting {{the lack of a}} normal biomechanical input. Moreover, the basic topological blueprint of cancellous bone investigated by the ITA method is nearly invariant in both normal and bound foot. These findings suggest that the anisotropic cancellous bone texture is an acquired characteristic that reflects recurrent loading conditions; conversely, an inadequate biomechanical input precludes the formation of anisotropic texture. This opens a long-sought-after possibility to reconstruct bone function from its form. The conserved topological parameters characterize the generic 3 D fabric of cancellous bone, which is to a large extent independent of its adaptation to recurrent loading and perhaps determines the mechanical competence of trabecular bone regardless of its functional adaptation. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{extend the}} recent {{empirical}} {{literature on the}} link between financial development and economic volatility {{by focusing on the}} channels through which financial development impacts economic volatility. Specifically, we use a panel data set for 1960 - 97 and 63 countries to investigate whether a well-developed financial sector dampens the impact that the volatility of terms of trade changes, inflation and government expenditure has on the volatility of real per capita GDP growth rates. We find robust evidence that a higher level of financial development dampens the positive effect of the volatility of terms of trade changes on economic volatility, especially in high-income countries, while it magnifies the impact of inflation volatility in non-high income countries. We do not find a robust effect of finance on the volatility of government expenditures. These results are consistent with our model that predicts that real sector <b>shocks</b> are <b>dampened</b> in their effect on output volatility by a well developed financial sector, while monetary shocks are magnified and propagated through the financial sector...|$|R

In order to attain both, central banks must develop macroprudential instruments {{in order to prevent}} the occurrence of systemic risk episodes. For this reason testing the effectiveness of different macroprudential tools and their interaction with monetary policy is crucial. In this paper we explore whether two policy instruments, namely, a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) rule in combination with a Taylor rule may provide a better macroeconomic outcome than a Taylor rule alone. We conduct our analysis by appending a macroeconometric financial block to an otherwise standard semistructural small open economy neokeynesian model for policy analysis estimated for the Mexican economy. Our results show that with the inclusion of the second policy instrument the central bank can obtain substantial gains. Moreover, we find that when the CAR rule is adequately designed the central authority can mitigate output gap shocks of twice the variance than the Taylor rule alone scenario. Thus, under this two rule case the central authority can isolate financial <b>shocks</b> and <b>dampen</b> their effects over macroeconomic variables. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the nature of the}} linkage between financial development and economic fluctuation in 22 OECD countries over the period from 1970 through 2000. Two econometric techniques are used: The first, a cross-sectional instrument variable estimator, deals, to some degree, with the potential problems caused by simultaneity, omitted variables and unobserved country-specific effects. The second technique to be applied is the standard fixed effects model, which is designed to capture variation across country and time periods in simple shifts of the regression function (i. e., changes in the intercepts). The results obtained by these techniques confirm that arm's length financing has a role in destabilising the business cycle in the OECD countries while relationship lending is neutral in this respect. The magnitude of the independent impact of the stock market on output growth fluctuation is significant. In accordance with theory, there is also a strong indication that both market-based and bank-based financial systems magnify the impact of monetary shocks on macroeconomic volatility whereas real <b>shocks</b> are <b>dampened</b> by well-developed financial systems.

40|$|Financial {{constraints}} are {{widespread in}} developing countries, where even short term credit is limited. Finance held by firms as working capital {{is a substantial}} proportion of sales revenue, yet the role of working capital is largely neglected by existing models of financial constraints. I present a dynamic model of the firm that incorporates working capital by introducing a delay between factor payments and the receipt of revenue. In contrast with previous models, the working capital model predicts that firms under binding constraints will substitute between labor and capital in response to demand shocks, causing investment to be countercyclical. For firms near the margin of being constrained, constraints bind when positive production opportunities arise. Output growth is therefore constrained in response to positive shocks but not to negative shocks. Simulations suggest that models without working capital may understate the predicted effects of financial constraints on production efficiency, firm profit and growth over time. I test the predictions using the recently completed Bangladesh Panel Survey for manufacturing firms. Consistent with the theory, I find evidence that constraints bind when output price increases, that investment by constrained firms is countercyclical, and that output response to positive <b>shocks</b> is <b>dampened</b> for firms that are sometimes constrained. The results also are important for policy. In order to maximize growth, efforts to relieve credit constraints should be focused on periods when demand shocks are high. ...|$|R
