50|$|In an {{electrodialysis}} stack, the dilute (D) feed stream, brine or concentrate (C) stream, and electrode (E) stream {{are allowed}} to flow through the appropriate cell compartments formed by the ion exchange membranes. Under the influence of an electrical potential difference, the negatively charged ions (e.g., chloride) in the dilute stream migrate toward the positively charged anode. These ions pass through the positively charged anion exchange membrane, but are prevented from further migration toward the anode by the negatively charged cation exchange membrane and therefore stay in the C stream, which becomes concentrated with the anions. The positively charged species (e.g., sodium) in the D stream migrate toward the negatively charged cathode and pass through the negatively charged cation exchange membrane. These cations also stay in the C stream, prevented from further migration toward the cathode by the positively charged anion exchange membrane. As {{a result of the}} anion and cation migration, electric current flows between the cathode and anode. Only an equal number of anion and cation charge equivalents are transferred from the D stream into the C stream and so the charge balance is maintained in each stream. The overall result of the electrodialysis process is an ion concentration increase in the concentrate stream with a depletion of ions in the dilute <b>solution</b> <b>feed</b> stream see video.|$|E

The rejection mechanisms of N-nitrosamines were first examined using one nanofiltration (NF 90) and two reverse osmosis (TFC-HR and SWC 5) membranes. The TFC-HR membrane was used to investigate the effects of <b>feed</b> <b>solution</b> characteristics. The {{rejection of}} a particular N-nitrosamine was generally membrane dependent and increased in the order of NF (NF 90), low pressure RO (TFC-HR) and seawater RO (SWC 5) membranes. In general, the rejection of N-nitrosamines by a given membrane also increased in the order of increasing molecular weight. These results suggested that steric hindrance was a dominating rejection mechanism of N-nitrosamines. Nevertheless, it was also observed from the result of N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) that the rejection of N-nitrosamines may also depend on other physicochemical properties such as hydrophobicity. A decrease in the <b>feed</b> <b>solution</b> pH (from 9 to 3) resulted in a decrease in the rejection of the two smallest molecular weight N-nitrosamines, namely N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrosomethylethylamine (NMEA). Changes in the <b>feed</b> <b>solution</b> ionic strength (from 26 to 260 mM) caused a discernible decrease only in NDMA rejection, while no apparent impact on rejection was observed for an increase in the feed concentration. On the other hand, it is striking that an increase in the feed temperature led to a significant decrease in the rejection of all N-nitrosamines and the impact was more pronounced for the small molecular weight N-nitrosamines. For example, a significant drop in NDMA rejection (from 49 to 25 %) was observed as the feed temperature increased from 20 to 30 degrees C. The results also indicate that pH, ionic strength, and temperature of the <b>feed</b> <b>solution</b> can exert some influence on the rejection of NDMA and in some cases other N-nitrosamines. The combined effects of these <b>feed</b> <b>solution</b> characteristics, particularly <b>feed</b> temperature, may account for some of the variation of NDMA rejection by RO membranes previously reported in the literature...|$|R
