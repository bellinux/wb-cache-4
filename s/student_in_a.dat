40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{quasi-experimental}} {{study was to determine}} if upper-level college <b>students</b> who participated <b>in</b> AgPAQ, <b>an</b> integrated course cluster learning community, would demonstrate enhanced learning in the areas of oral communication, written communication, and agronomic/economic technical content knowledge. The population (N = 182) consisted of <b>students</b> who participated <b>in</b> AgPAQ and five comparison groups: <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> farm management class; <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stand-alone soil, fertilizer, and water management class; <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> soil, fertilizer, and water management class linked with an English course; and <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> paid volunteer group who had not previously participated in AgPAQ. Instruments included three rubrics that measured performance on written communication, oral communication, and agronomic/economic technical content knowledge. Analyses revealed that AgPAQ participants scored higher than non-AgPAQ participants on measures of oral and written communication in all comparisons. Also, AgPAQ participants scored higher on measures of agronomic/economic technical content knowledge than <b>students</b> <b>in</b> the non-AgPAQ paid volunteer group and <b>students</b> <b>in</b> the stand-alone soil, fertilizer, and water management class. AgPAQ participants also scored higher, but not significantly higher, than <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> English and agronomy linked integration. AgPAQ fostered enhanced learning in oral communication, written communication, and agronomic/economic technical content knowledge...|$|R

25|$|In April 1919, he took {{command of}} the 2nd Consolidated brigade of the 37th Rifle Division. On 19 October 1920 Shmidt was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for his actions in {{capturing}} Rylsk, and the Liubotyn rail junction near Kremenchuk during the Red Army's crossing of the Dnieper. The award citation also mentioned the capture of Kryukovo. During heavy fighting near Shepetivka with Symon Petliura's army, Shmidt, according to the citation, had been seriously wounded but remained in the battle, personally operating guns against an armored train. In August 1919, Shmidt became chief of the VOHR's Yaroslavl district. He then became acting commander of the 37th Rifle Division. In November, he led the brigade in fighting at Tsaritsyn during the Armed Forces of South Russia's retreat. On 19 November, Shmidt personally led the brigade in defeating White units. On 24 November, his unit operated in the White rear and almost entirely captured the White Grenadier Division. On 29 November, during the attack at Tsaritsyn, Shmidt was wounded but stayed in the battle. After being wounded a second time he was evacuated. In 1920, Shmidt became commander of the forces at Kherson. At the end of 1920 he became a <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> course at the Academy of the General Staff. At this time he met Alexander Barmine, who later defected. On 25 June 1921 Shmidt was awarded a second Order of the Red Banner for his actions at Tsaritsyn.|$|E
25|$|In Romania, {{medical school}} is a {{department}} of a medical university, which typically includes Dentistry and Pharmacy departments as well. The name facultate is used for departments in their universities too, but the Medicine departments distinguish themselves by the length of studies (6 years), which grants to graduates a status equivalent {{to that of a}} Master in Science. The Medicine departments are also marked by reduced flexibility - in theory, a <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> regular university can take courses from different departments, like Chemistry and Geography (although it usually does not happen, majors being clearly defined), while the medical universities do not have any extra offers for their students, due to their specialization. Admission to medical faculty is usually awarded by passing a Human Biology, Organic Chemistry and/or Physics test. The program lasts 6 years, with first 2 years being preclinical and last 4 years being mostly clinical. After these six years, one has to take the national licence exam (which consists of mostly clinically oriented questions, but some questions also deal with basic sciences) and has to write a thesis in any field he/she studied. Final award is Doctor-Medic (titlu onorific) (shortened Dr.), which is not an academic degree (similar to Germany). All graduates have to go through residency and specialization exams after that in order to practice, although older graduates had different requirements and training (e.g., clinical rotations similar to sub-internship) and might still be able to practice Family Medicine / General Medicine.|$|E
500|$|Malta's {{educational}} system {{is divided into}} four stages: pre-primary (ages 3–5), primary (ages 5–11), secondary (ages 11–16) and tertiary. Pre-primary education is optional but fully funded by the state. In their last ten years of primary education, students are placed on tracks based on educational attainment, and {{at the age of}} eleven, students sit an eleven plus examination to eliminate a student's secondary schooling direction. Success in the eleven plus exam places a <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> junior lyceum - a prestigious secondary school - while mediocre performance or not sitting the examination places a <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> less competitive secondary school. Secondary Education Certificate (NEC) examinations are taken at age 16, and matriculation examinations are taken at age 18 to determine university entrance eligibility. In 2008, 26,711 primary students, 25,793 secondary students, 5,719 post-secondary students, 9,472 tertiary students and 6,268 vocational students were enrolled in educational courses in Malta. Approximately 30 per cent of Malta's primary and secondary school students are enrolled in private schools, most of which are operated by the Catholic Church. Malta's highest post-secondary institution is the University of Malta, which has operated since 1552 ...|$|E

500|$|In 1964, {{the school}} {{permitted}} exhibition football games to resume, and students financed {{the purchase of}} a young English bulldog named Royal Jacket, whom they intended to rename [...] "Hoya", but he only responded to the callname [...] "Jack".

[...] The athletics department subsequently adopted as its logo a drawing of a bulldog sporting a blue and gray freshman beanie. The original Jack retired in 1967, but the name was carried over to his successors. In 1977, the university began the tradition of dressing up a <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> blue and gray bulldog costume, replacing the live bulldog, though several dogs periodically joined the costumed mascot during the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
500|$|Syaoran {{appears in}} other adaptations of Tsubasa, {{including}} the animated film The Princess in the Birdcage Kingdom, {{in which he}} still travels with Sakura, Fai, Kurogane and Mokona across dimensions.

Outside Tsubasa, Syaoran appears in Clamp's manga xxxHolic, which shows events in Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle. He {{does not appear in}} the animated adaptions of xxxHolic until the original video animation (OVA) series xxxHolic Shunmuki, in which he appears in the Dream World to confront the original Syaoran. In the spin-off drama CD series Holitsuba Gakuen, Syaoran is featured as a new <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> school named [...] "Holitsuba", which includes characters from Tsubasa and xxxHolic.

500|$|From late 1910 {{to early}} 1912, Cerna {{was at the}} University of Leipzig, where he {{attended}} courses held by the philosophers and psychologists Wilhelm Wundt, Eduard Spranger and Hans Volkelt. Wundt left an enduring impression on his Romanian <b>student.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> letter home, Cerna described his modest appearance, which he claimed recalled that of [...] "decrepit" [...] Orthodox members of the Romanian Jewish community, adding: [...] "But I do love this decrepit exterior beyond measure..." [...] Volkelt guided Cerna's research in the scientific field, and coordinated his PhD thesis of 1913, Die Gedankenlyrik (German for [...] "Contemplative Poetry"). According to Călinescu, Cerna's work stated the primacy of [...] "natural ideas" [...] over reasoning, and concluded that [...] "ideas have the purpose of signaling the problematic tensions of the soul." [...] Zarifopol wrote that Cerna was upset over having himself parted with writing poetry, and came to be preoccupied by Maiorescu's German-language dictum: In der Poesie ist der Gedanke ein verfluchtes Ding ("An idea is a damned thing {{when it comes to}} poetry"). Panait Cerna's first volume of collected poetry was published at home in 1910, and, two years later, resulted in the author being made a co-recipient of the Romanian Academy's Vasile Adamachi Award. Some of his new poems were still being published by Convorbiri Literare in 1911.|$|E
