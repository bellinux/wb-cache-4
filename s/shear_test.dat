40|$|The {{connecting}} beams in slit shear {{walls are}} generally much shorter {{than those in}} ordinary coupled shear walls and may therefore behave quite differently. In order to investigate the shear behaviour of such short connecting beams, two series of <b>shear</b> <b>tests,</b> one on monotonic behaviour {{and the other on}} cyclic behaviour, were carried out. Altogether, 24 specimens were tested. The results of the monotonic <b>shear</b> <b>tests</b> have been reported in an earlier paper. This Paper presents some additional information on the ductility of the beams as revealed by the monotonic <b>shear</b> <b>tests,</b> and the results of the cyclic <b>shear</b> <b>tests.</b> From the cyclic <b>shear</b> <b>tests,</b> the cracking and failure characteristics, reinforcement stress distribution, stiffness and strength degradations, ductility and damping capacity, etc., of the connecting beams are studied.

40|$|Glass-Reinforced Polymer (GRP) bolts, {{commonly}} known as Fibre Glass (FG) dowels are increasingly applied for strata reinforcement in mines. The most popular dowels used in coal mines are the 22 mm diameter fully threaded type. A series of tests were undertaken to evaluate various strength properties of FG dowels.

40|$|Shear {{strength}} {{is an important}} soil parameter. Many geotechnical failures {{have been caused by}} inadequate shear strength. In order to obtain a high strength modelling silty clay for use in centrifuge model tests of soil-pipeline interaction, direct <b>shear</b> <b>tests,</b> <b>shear</b> vane <b>tests</b> and cone penetration tests were conducted to investigate its shear strength behaviour. [...] This thesis first presents some background on the shear strength of soils and measurement techniques. The details of the direct <b>shear</b> <b>tests,</b> the <b>shear</b> vane <b>tests,</b> the cone penetration tests and centrifuge modelling are also discussed. The silty clays used in this study were kaolin and a kaolin-silt mixture; the plasticity indices were 30. 6 % and 19. 5 % respectively. The kaolin-silt mixture (K-S) was obtained by mixing equal amounts of kaolin and silt by weight. [...] Direct shear and <b>shear</b> vane <b>tests</b> were conducted on both clays at different vertical stresses under various overconsolidation ratios (OCR's). This thesis presents these test procedures and the test results. Cone penetration tests were also conducted in a centrifuge at 50 gravities to verify the results from the direct shear and <b>shear</b> vane <b>tests</b> and to correlate the cone penetration resistance to the undrained shear strength from shear vane and direct <b>shear</b> <b>tests.</b> Centrifuge modelling principles and the current methods to convert cone tip resistance to shear strength are also presented. Test results show that the shear strength of K-S is higher than that of pure kaolin. Shear strengths of heavily overconsolidated clays obtained from the <b>shear</b> vane <b>tests</b> are higher than those obtained from the direct <b>shear</b> <b>tests.</b> A correlation between cone tip resistance and undrained shear {{strength is}} presented. The shear strength of K-S interpreted from CPT results was found to lie between the direct shear and <b>shear</b> vane <b>test</b> results and shows a good correlation in the measurement of shear strength...|$|R
