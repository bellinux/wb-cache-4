500|$|Liam Cunningham, who portrays Davos Seaworth, {{spoke about}} {{the writing of the}} episode {{following}} its airing, and revealed how he reacted to the scene, saying [...] "It was initially shocking. You know what I thought was my favorite bit, and I <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> David and Dan, it was at that moment when the reveal comes and you kind of go, 'Oh my God,' it puts things into context with Melisandre. It doesn't explain or blah, blah, blah. … It's confirmed like, she's a witch, but there was such a touch of humanity. When she went to the bed and got into the bed and covered herself up… it was like a really striking moment in this weird madness of humanity." ...|$|E
500|$|In Will's absence, the glee club hires Dakota Stanley (Whit Hertford), the {{choreographer}} {{of a rival}} club, Vocal Adrenaline, to help coach them to a Nationals championship. Cheerleaders Quinn (Dianna Agron), Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris) {{hope that}} the notoriously harsh Stanley will prompt {{some members of the}} club to quit, furthering their plan to sabotage the club. Although Stanley is heavily critical of most of the group, Rachel convinces the members that their differences give them a unique edge, and fires the choreographer. The cheerleaders also lead Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) to believe that fellow club member Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) has feelings for her, leaving her hurt when he rejects her advances. He misleads her into believing he has feelings for Rachel, which angers Mercedes, and she breaks the windshield of his car and sings [...] "Bust Your Windows". Kurt later confesses to her that he is gay—the first time he has <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> anyone—and the two make up.|$|E
500|$|In 1979, Gray {{spoke with}} TV Guide (Canada) and recounted: [...] "At first, {{they had no}} idea what to do with the part. Sue Ellen's lines ran to 'More coffee, darling?' and 'I have a headache.' Victoria Principal and Patrick Duffy were the goody-goodies. Jim Davis and Barbara Bel Geddes were parental. Hagman was the villain. And I was the redhead on the couch." [...] However, Gray was {{upgraded}} to a starring role once Dallas was picked up for a full season following the five episode arc miniseries. The actress later stated that on-screen husband Larry Hagman had criticized one of her performances early on during the start of the series, and called it [...] "terrible", though he denied it. She joked, [...] "I'm sorry. He <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me loud and clear, and made me feel terrible, and it started one of our first fights on the way back [...] I swear to you—he devastated me. Then, years later, he said, 'Oh, I didn't mean that.' I could have killed him!" ...|$|E

500|$|Another myth {{concerns}} Saul Bass, {{the graphic}} designer who created {{many of the}} title sequences of Hitchcock's films and storyboarded some of Psychos scenes, claiming he had directed the shower scene. This was refuted by several figures associated with the film, including Leigh, who stated: [...] "absolutely not! I have emphatically said this in any interview I've ever given. I've <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his face in front of other people... I was in that shower for seven days, and, believe me, Alfred Hitchcock was right next to his camera {{for every one of}} those seventy-odd shots." [...] Hilton A. Green, the assistant director, also refutes Bass' claim: [...] "There is not a shot in that movie that I didn't roll the camera for. And I can tell you I never rolled the camera for Mr. Bass." [...] Roger Ebert, a longtime admirer of Hitchcock's work, summarily dismissed the rumor, stating, [...] "It seems unlikely that a perfectionist with an ego like Hitchcock's would let someone else direct such a scene." ...|$|E
500|$|Around 2:00a.m., a few {{boats were}} finally {{procured}} for the crossing. However, only 83 men {{made it to}} the other side of the lake before Allen and Arnold, concerned that dawn was approaching, decided to attack. In the early dawn, the small force marched on the fort, surprising the lone sentry. Allen went directly to the fort commander's quarters, seeking to force his surrender. [...] Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham, the assistant to the fort's commander, Captain William Delaplace, was awakened by the noise, and called to wake the captain. Stalling for time, he demanded to know by what authority the fort was being entered. Allen, who later claimed that he <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Captain Delaplace, said, [...] "In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!" [...] Delaplace finally emerged from his chambers, fully dressed, and surrendered his sword. The rest of the fort's garrison surrendered without firing a shot. The only casualty had been a British soldier who became concussed after Allen hit the soldier with a cutlass, hitting the man's hair comb and saving his life.|$|E
500|$|Record {{producer}} Paul A. Rothchild, {{who worked}} with the band on their first five albums, attended the early sessions but quit following friction with the band. This included his dissatisfaction with the song [...] "Love Her Madly," [...] which [...] "drove [...] out of the studio." [...] He felt that recording the composition was a step backwards artistically, calling it [...] "cocktail music." [...] Rothchild {{has said that the}} remark was directed toward [...] "Riders on the Storm," [...] although he maintains that he <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> [...] "make [...] angry enough to do something good." [...] Rothchild also left because the group were slow in developing new material, especially as the band contained three songwriters. His enthusiasm with the band deteriorated further after he was unable to persuade Morrison to consistently attend rehearsals. As Botnick revealed in the book Love Becomes a Funeral Pyre, another issue that led to Rothchild's leaving was the emotional devastation he felt after the death of Janis Joplin, whom he had worked with on her second solo effort, Pearl. Rothchild left before any master takes were complete, recommending that the Doors co-produce L.A. Woman with Bruce Botnick, the sound engineer who had worked with Rothchild on the band's previous recordings.|$|E

500|$|By 11:30pm on May 9, {{the men had}} {{assembled}} at Hand's Cove (in what is now Shoreham, Vermont) and were ready to cross the lake to Ticonderoga. However, boats did not arrive until 1:30am, and they were inadequate to carry the whole force. Eighty-three of the Green Mountain Boys made the first crossing with Arnold and Allen, and Douglas went back for the rest. As dawn approached, Allen and Arnold became fearful of losing the element of surprise, {{so they decided to}} attack with the men at hand. The only sentry on duty at the south gate fled his post after his musket misfired, and the Americans rushed into the fort. [...] The Patriots then roused the small number of sleeping troops at gunpoint, and began confiscating their weapons. [...] Allen, Arnold, and a few other men charged up the stairs toward the officers' quarters. [...] Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham, assistant to Captain William Delaplace, was awakened by the noise, and called to wake the captain. [...] Stalling for time, Feltham demanded to know by what authority the fort was being entered. Allen, who later claimed that he <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Captain Delaplace, replied, [...] "In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!" [...] Delaplace finally emerged from his chambers (fully clothed, not with [...] "his breeches in his hand", as Allen would later say) and surrendered his sword.|$|E
2500|$|Libby {{told the}} grand jury [...] "it seemed {{to me as if}} I was {{learning}} it for the first time" [...] when, according to his account, Russert told him about Plame on July 10 or 11, 2003. Only later, when looking at his calendar and notes, Libby said, did he remember that he actually learned the information from Cheney in June 2003. Libby told {{the grand jury}}: [...] "In the course of the document production, the FBI sent us a request for documents, or Justice Department, I'm not sure technically. In the course of that document production I came across the note that is dated on or about June 12, and the note... shows that I hadn't first learned it from Russert, although that was my memory, I had first learned it when he <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me." [...] The note Libby referred to contains no suggestion that either Cheney or Libby knew at the time of Ms. Wilson's undercover status or that her identity was classified, but they do show that Cheney did know and told Libby that Ms. Wilson was employed by the CIA and that she may have helped arrange her husband's trip.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Abbahu said in Rabbi Eleazar's {{name that}} [...] "his trained men" [...] in [...] meant Torah scholars, and thus when Abram made them fight to rescue Lot, he brought {{punishment}} on {{himself and his}} children, who were consequently enslaved in Egyptian for 210 years. But Samuel said that Abram was punished because he questioned whether God would keep God's promise, when in [...] Abram asked God [...] "how shall I know that I shall inherit it?" [...] And Rabbi Johanan said that Abram was punished because he prevented people from entering beneath {{the wings of the}} Shekhinah and being saved, when in [...] the king of Sodom <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Abram, [...] "Give me the persons, and take the goods yourself," [...] and Abram consented to leave the prisoners with the king of Sodom. Rav interpreted the words [...] "And he armed his trained servants, born in his own house" [...] in [...] to mean that Abram equipped them by teaching them the Torah. Samuel read the word vayarek ("he armed") to mean [...] "bright," [...] and thus interpreted the words [...] "And he armed his trained servants" [...] in [...] to mean that Abram made them bright with gold, that is, rewarded them for accompanying him.|$|E
