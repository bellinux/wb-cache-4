40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} substrate accumulation (sulphate and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)) on bioprocess control of a sulfate reducing inversed fluidized bed bioreactor. To investigate the impact of substrate accumulation, <b>step</b> <b>feed</b> changes were induced to an inversed fluidized bed bioreactor performing biological sulphate reduction. A first <b>step</b> <b>feed</b> change set both the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and sulphate influent concentration to zero. As hypothesised, sulphide was still being produced after 15 days of operation without electron donor and sulphate supply. This suggests that accumulated and/or sorbed COD and sulphate supported the continued biological sulphide production. PHB was indeed found present in the sludge and batch tests showed PHB can support the sulphate reduction. A second <b>step</b> <b>feed</b> change of adding solely COD (and no sulphate) to the bioreactor influent resulted in a continuous production of sulphide, suggesting that sulphate had accumulated in the inversed fluidized bed bioreactor sludge. A mathematical model that includes microbial growth, PHB and sulphate storage as well as metabolism of lactate oxidizing sulphate reducing bacteria was developed, calibrated and validated. The model was able to simulate the accumulation of both PHB and sulphate in the inversed fluidized bed bioreactor. </p...|$|E

The necessary conditions for this processes are considered.

In this paper the recent advances of process design and operational optimization for nutrients removal are reviewed. Increasing volatile fatty acids is the main direction for higher efficiency of biological removal phosphorus. Products fermentation of primary sludge or feeding in anaerobic and anoxic zones is used for increase of volatile fatty acids.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{technique}} for on-line estimation of oxygen uptake rate (OUR) and to investigate the use of OUR in monitoring and control of the activated sludge process. A mathematical expression for the relationship between the plant specific oxygen transfer coefficient (K) and air flow rate was necessary for the estimation of OUR. Three different least squares methods, a direct linear method, a discrete linear method, and a non-linear method, were investigated as estimation techniques for K. Data from a full-scale, instrumented wastewater treatment plant were collected in order to evaluate the usefulness of each of the three methods. It was found that the direct linear method with data smoothing, although mathematically less rigorous than the other two methods, yielded a satisfactory estimate and was preferred over the non-linear method because of its computational simplicity. Difficulties were encountered with the discrete linear method because of disturbances in flow rate at the plant due to the on-off operation of several influent pumps. A comparison between the measured and estimated OUR showed similar trends indicating that the estimated OUR could be used in control. The use of OUR for control purposes was investigated by means of computer simulations using an existing mathematical model modified to simulate conditions at the full-scale plant. Control strategies, using OUR estimates, for air flow rate and <b>step</b> <b>feed</b> manipulation were developed and demonstrated to be effective.

40|$|The {{wastewater}} {{infrastructure in}} Singapore {{is undergoing a}} major revamp, which includes {{the construction of a}} new water reclamation plant (WRP) in Tuas. This plant aims to maximise the energy recovered from wastewater, with the ultimate aim of achieving energy self-sufficiency. The Integrated Validation Plant (IVP) is a 1000 m 3 /day pilot plant equipped with an AB configuration. The A-stage biosorption process increases the amount of COD recovered in the primary sludge to increase biogas production, whereas the B-stage membrane bioreactor (MBR) treats the wastewater using activated sludge. The effluent then undergoes reverse osmosis (RO) to produce potable water. This report investigates the biological treatment process in the IVP and aims to answer the following question: Given that most WRP in Singapore uses the Modified Ludzack-Ettinger configuration (MLE; also known as the pre-denitrification configuration) for the B-stage, will a change in configuration reduce net energy consumption while achieving good effluent quality? The research is divided into three main parts with the following objectives: 1. To create and calibrate a Biowin model to simulate the biological treatment process in the IVP 2. To optimise the MBR B-stage by finding the configuration and operating conditions that requires the least influent COD to achieve acceptable effluent quality (in terms of COD, nitrogen and phosphorus), and to determine the appropriate changes in the A-stage (if any) that is required to achieve this effluent quality 3. To explore issues facing the IVP and future developments of wastewater treatment in Singapore – effect of an unaerated deoxygenation tank, feasibility of mainstream Anammox, and modification of the treatment process to reduce chemical dosage in the downstream RO process The Biowin model for the MBR was first calibrated using jar tests and oxygen uptake tests, then validated with profile studies that are being carried out in the MBR regularly. It was found that Biowin is able to model the biological treatment process relatively well, with the major discrepancy being that Biowin is not able to model ammonia adsorption onto activated sludge in the anoxic zone. With the calibrated model, various configurations and operating conditions were simulated to optimise the MBR. It was found that the optimal configuration is the Anoxic-Oxic-Anoxic-Oxic (AOAO) configuration with a <b>step</b> <b>feed</b> of 50 % of the influent entering the first anoxic zone and 50 % entering the second anoxic zone. The return activated sludge (RAS) flow should be 73 % of the influent flow and the DO in the aerated tanks should be maintained at 1 mg/l. As the biosorption tank at the IVP is not functioning well, data was obtained from another biosorption pilot plant in Singapore to calibrate the A-stage. Using this calibrated biosorption model, the optimal MBR configuration, and the typical raw influent characteristics for the IVP, it was determined that a functioning biosorption stage will result in insufficient COD entering the MBR for sufficient phosphorus removal. To achieve the required effluent quality, the best option during steady state operations would be to reduce the sludge retention time (SRT) of the biosorption process from 0. 5 days to 0. 32 days by increasing sludge wastage as this leads to the highest overall COD recovery. On the other hand, the best method to cope with sudden increases in the nitrogen and phosphorus load in the raw influent would be to partially bypass the biosorption tank and divert some of the raw influent to the primary clarifier as this option results in the fastest response in the effluent quality. As the membrane tanks in the MBR are aerated to scour the membranes and minimise fouling, the mixed liquor in the tanks have a high concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO). A small deoxygenation tank is installed after the membrane tanks to allow DO to deplete before the mixed liquor is recycled back to the anoxic zone at the start of the MBR. However, the deoxygenation tank is not functioning well due to the presence of a cascade overflow from the membrane tanks. Simulations show that the presence of residual DO in the recycle stream leads to a large deterioration the biological phosphorus removal performance of the MBR, mainly due to reduced COD availability for the polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs). Modifications to reduce the impact of the cascade include the installation of baffle walls, slopes, or overflow pipes. One of the technologies for B-stage that can allow even higher COD recovery is mainstream Anammox for nitrogen removal, which consumes less COD than conventional nitrogen-removal processes. As it works best at temperatures of about 30 oC, it may be suitable for implementation in Singapore where the average wastewater temperature is about 31 oC. Biowin simulations revealed that mainstream Anammox can occur under the local conditions, with CANON and DEMON configurations being more suitable than the SHARON-Anammox configuration. However, a very high solids removal efficiency in the primary clarifier is required to remove sufficient COD in the A-stage for Anammox to develop in the B-stage. Further studies would be required to determine if this is achievable under local conditions. Lastly, the MBR effluent is sent to a RO process to be reclaimed as potable water. Ammonia and sodium hypochlorite is first added to produce chloramine to prevent biofouling and provide the necessary residual disinfection. it was found that the ammonia concentration in the MBR effluent can be increased sufficiently to remove the need for ammonia dosage. However, the reduced nitrification also resulted in a higher nitrite concentration in the effluent, increasing the amount of sodium hypochlorite needed to produce the required chloramine as sodium hypochlorite also oxidises nitrite into nitrate. In addition, the dosage of anti-scalants can be reduced with better phosphorus removal as the lower effluent phosphorus leads to less scaling potential in the RO process by calcium phosphate.

40|$|Nitrification {{has been}} studied {{extensively}} {{as a result of}} its significance within the biological process and at intervals the necessity for treatment of waste water. In the last decade, the treatment of high ammonical concentration effluents has become a matter of nice interest. Many effluents will contain some hundred milligrams of nitrogen per liter (supernatants from anaerobic digestion, lechates from municipal water, etc.) may have specific treatment before utilization them to the plant recycling process. Sometimes this reaction is applied by maintaining robust ammonical concentrations which have the role of inhibiting the nitrite – oxidizing population responsible for the reaction of nitrites into nitrates (final stage of nitrification). However the nitrification methods served as a very important basis for the development of today understands and mathematical models for several waste treatment processes (activated sludge process using biofilm reactors) and self – purification in rivers. Often nitrogen removal from sea wastewater is problematic due to the low rate of bacteria concerned. Immobilization is an economical technique to retain slow growing organisms in continuous flow reactors. Immobilized cells can be classified into “naturally” attached cells (biofilms) and “artificially” immobilized cells. The simultaneous nitrification and denitrification within the <b>step</b> <b>feeding</b> biological nitrogen removal method were investigated below different inflowing substrate and aeration flow rates. The experimental results showed that there was additionally linear relationship between simultaneous nitrification and denitrification and DO concentration below the conditions of low and high aeration rate...|$|R
