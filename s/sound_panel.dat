40|$|An {{interactive}} and iterative {{control panel}} layout method {{based on the}} constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) technique was developed to generate an ergonomically <b>sound</b> <b>panel</b> design. This control panel layout method attempts to incorporate a variety of relevant ergonomic principles and design constraints, and generate an optimal or, at least, a 'satisfactory ' solution through an efficient search algorithm. The problem of seeking an ergonomically <b>sound</b> <b>panel</b> design {{should be viewed as}} a multi-criteria problem, and most of the design objectives should be understood as constraints. Hence, a CSP technique was employed in this study for dealing with the multi-constraints layout problem. The efficient search algorithm using 'preprocess ' and 'Iook [...] ahead ' procedures was developed to handle the vast amount of computational effort. In order to apply the CSP technique to the panel layout procedure, the ergonomic principles such as spatial compatibility, frequency-of-use, importance, functional grouping, and sequence-of-use were formalized as CSP terms. The effectiveness of the proposed panel layout method was evaluated by example problems, and the results clearly showed that the generated layouts properly considered various ergonomic design principles. 1...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{amplification}} and distortion of noise in incubators by measuring noise levels {{from various sources}} under various conditions. STUDY DESIGN: We recorded sound pressure levels (SPL) of background noise, baby crying, alarms and porthole closing with the incubator hood open or closed. Then we tried to reduce the sound level in the incubator by applying a <b>sound</b> absorbing <b>panel</b> to {{the ceiling of the}} hood. RESULTS: The sound sources analysed produced very high SPL. In free field baby crying and porthole noise were, respectively, 81 - 83 dB and 70 - 71 dB, closing the hood they raised to 84 - 87 and 73 - 74 dB: this means that the noise perceived by a baby in the incubator had twice the SPL of the same noise emitted in a free field; alarm noise was 56 - 57 dB inside incubators. Sound emitted inside the hood was also distorted, i. e. it had different features from the same source in a free field. The insulating panel prevented amplification and distortion due to the hood and reduced the SPL of alarms. Only background noise did not decrease with the <b>panel.</b> <b>Sound</b> absorbing <b>panel</b> reduced baby's crying, porthole noise and alarm noise SPL to 82 - 85, 70 - 71 and 50 - 51 dB, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Incubators are reverberating environments, which amplify the baby's cry and other noises produced inside the hood. The frequency components of noises are altered by the hood.

40|$|In recent years, many open-plan {{houses have}} been {{proposed}} not only for comfort reasons, {{but also as a}} place to engage in family life. However, in contrast to the fact that this kind of plan makes it easy for people to interact, the daily life household sounds that occur inside the home may be perceived as noise. It is especially difficult to suppress the propagation of sound and reverberation in staircase and stairwell areas due to the absence of sound-absorbing furniture. In this study, we focused on addressing sound management within the staircase area in open-plan housing where sound absorption is particularly difficult. In order to suppress sound propagation on the upper and lower floors and the reverberation of sound, we placed a thin <b>sound</b> absorption <b>panel</b> on the wall, ceiling, and riser of the staircase. As a result, we were able to confirm that the propagation of sound on upper and lower floors can be suppressed by carrying out the sound absorption treatment on the staircase. Furthermore, we found that in stairway landing areas, the suppression effect of the propagation of sound varies depending on the position of the sound source and the positioning of the <b>sound</b> absorption <b>panel,</b> {{and that there is a}} position for placing the <b>sound</b> absorption <b>panel</b> where the sound-absorbing effect is effective...|$|R

40|$|AMB- 21 {{is a new}} polymer {{developed}} by Mr. Ray Vannucci, NASA, LeRC as a noncarcinogenic polyimide matrix which may be suitable for fabricating composite parts by the Resin Transfer Modeling (RTM) process. The polyimide for this project was prepared at the Center of Composite Materials Research at N. C. A&T State University {{because it is not}} currently an item of commerce. The RTM process is especially suitable for producing geometrically complex composite parts at a low cost. Because of the high melting point and very high viscosity at the time of processing, polyimides have not been extensively used in the RTM process. The process for preparing AMB- 21 as well as the process for fabricating composite plates will be described. The basic fabrication process consists of injecting a solvent solution of AMP- 21 into a carbon fiber preform, evaporating the solvent, imidizing the polyimide, and vacuum/compression modeling the impregnated preform. All the above molding steps are preformed in a specially designed RTM mold which will be described. The results of this process have been inconsistent.
