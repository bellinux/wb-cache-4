40|$|Share {{premiums}} now {{constitute a}} substantial proportion of UK company equity but rarely featured on nineteenth century company balance sheets. This paper discusses when and why this changed {{and why the}} definition of the <b>share</b> <b>premium</b> <b>account</b> as company capital took nearly a century to reach the statute books. From 1855 to 1948 any surplus above par on issued shares could be treated at the directors' discretion, including appropriation for the payment of dividends. This freedom was removed in the Companies Act 1948 (s. 56), after the Cohen Committee recommended that share premiums should normally be treated as share capital and employed in a very limited range of transactions. The paper outlines the accounting and legal history of the <b>share</b> <b>premium</b> <b>account</b> and argues that the growth of share premiums was due to a tax avoidance loophole, open from 1889 to 1973, which permanently changed company practice on share issues after 1920. The effect of legal restrictions {{on the use of the}} <b>share</b> <b>premium</b> <b>account</b> is also addressed. One possible future consequence of the loss of economic significance of the nominal value of a share is the total abolition of both this and the <b>share</b> <b>premium</b> <b>account</b> by adoption of no par value (npv) shares, a change which has recently been adopted in Australia and is again under consideration in the UK.

40|$|M. Com. (Accounting) This study {{sets out}} to suggest a method of {{accounting}} for goodwill and brands which is practically feasible, yet conceptually justifiable. Only positive, acquired goodwill is relevant {{for purposes of this}} study. Both acquired and internally generated brands are, however, investigated. In terms of historical cost accounting, both acquired goodwill and brands qualify as assets of the enterprise since they are controlled by the enterprise as a result of past transactions and future economic benefits are expected to flow therefrom. Goodwill arises as a balancing amount in terms of double entry accounting {{as a result of the}} fact that the purchase consideration applicable to a business take-over often exceeds the aggregate of the fair values of the acquired enterprise's net assets. Because goodwill can therefore effectively be seen as a function of two other figures, the potential exists that it can be manipulated. A number of possible alternative accounting treatments of goodwill are in existence. In spite of a historical background of divergence, international statements now display increasing agreement in favour of the amortisation option. The opposite is, however, true in respect of the financial statements of South African companies. The. preparers and users of financial interest in preventing goodwill as statements have a vested far as possible. As regards goodwill that does arise, an accounting treatment with the smallest possible detrimental effect on the financial position and results of the company will enjoy preference. Contrary to this is the fact that the amortisation of goodwill is the most justifiable alternative from a conceptual point of view. A number of accounting options have been developed over the years with the intention of either preventing goodwill, or at least limiting its extent. Included in this is merger accounting (also called pooling of interests accounting) in terms of which goodwill is effectively set off against the <b>share</b> <b>premium</b> <b>account</b> in the case of a take-over where the purchase consideration is settled by means of a share issue. Another method is the capitalisation of brands in the place of goodwill. Brands are therefore considered to be a mere substitute for goodwill on the balance sheet and is consequently of doubtful value from an accounting and financial analysis point of view. In spite of a variety of accounting alternatives, acquired brands should thus be accounted for in the same way as goodwill. Furthermore, internally generated brands should not be acknowledged on the balance sheet. The implementation of this will lead to the artificial distinction between goodwill and brands losing its prominence in the course of tim...|$|E

40|$|Capital {{maintenance}} rules {{are part of}} a legal capital regime that consists of rules on raising capital and rules on maintaining it. The function of these rules is the protection of the corporation’s creditors. This is evidenced by the fact that in public as well as private companies the provisions on legal capital are not open to disapplication or variation even with unanimous shareholder consent. Thus, providing the company with a minimum of funding and ensuring equal treatment of shareholders are mere reflexes of creditor protection or, at best, ancillary purposes of legal capital. Legal capital is part of a corporation’s equity. The key feature of equity is that it ranks behind the claims of other stakeholders in the distribution of a corporation’s assets. Consequently, equity will also be the first part of a corporation’s funds to be depleted by losses. Capital {{maintenance rules}} seek to enforce this order of priority of different groups of stakeholders by restricting distributions to shareholders. Such restrictions are not unique to legal systems that have adopted a legal capital regime. A prominent example of a statute that has eliminated mandatory legal capital is the Delaware General Corporation Law. § 154 DCGL leaves it up to the directors to decide whether any part of the consideration received by the corporation for its shares shall be attributed to capital. Thus, a Delaware corporation need not have any stated capital. This has significant impact on the funds available for distribution to shareholders. Pursuant to § 170 (a) DGCL dividends may only be paid out of surplus or, in the absence of surplus, out of net profits of the current or the preceding fiscal year. § 154 DGCL defines surplus as the excess of a corporation’s net assets over the amount of its capital, and net assets as the amount by which total assets exceed total liabilities. A corporation without stated capital may, therefore, distribute all of its net assets to its shareholders and continue business without any equity on its balance sheet. This highlights the difference between the different approaches to creditor protection in Germany and the U. S. Both legal systems acknowledge the priority of creditors over shareholders in corporate distributions. However, German law seeks to give creditors additional comfort by requiring companies to raise and maintain additional layers of assets above and beyond those corresponding to the company’s liabilities that may not be depleted by way of distributions to shareholders. While private companies must merely raise and maintain their stated capital, public companies are required to raise and maintain additional equity accounts unavailable for distributions to shareholders such as the <b>share</b> <b>premium</b> <b>account</b> 1 and the legal reserve. 2 In recent years a number of objections have been raised against this concept of creditor protection. Critics argue that contractual arrangements are a more efficient means for protecting the interests of creditors. 3 Capital maintenance does not prevent creditors from negotiating for more stringent protection of their claims such as collateral or financial covenants. It does, however, provide a minimum standard of protection for the benefit of creditors who lack the commercial experience or the bargaining power or who, like tort victims, are simply unable to negotiate for contractual safeguards. Capital maintenance ensures that their protection against excessive distributions does not depend on large creditors who are free to waive covenants that, in effect, benefit all creditors in exchange for individual arrangements that work exclusively in their favour...|$|E

In this paper, we study on the effect of information diffusion in Chinese stock market before and after the owership release in February 19, 2001, by testing the stationary of A <b>share</b> <b>premium</b> and cointegration between A and B share prices. The panel unit root tests we propose on A <b>share</b> <b>premium</b> are Augmented Dickey-Fullar (ADF) tests for individual firm and Fisher tests for the panel, based on combining pvalues from each individual cross-section. The panel cointegration tests on A and B shares we use is Johansen’s likelihood ratio tests for individual firm and likelihoodbased panel cointegraion tests for panel, based on combining the test statistics. The results show that before the opening of B share markets to domestic investors, A <b>share</b> <b>premiums</b> have a unit root and there is no cointegration relationship between A and B share markets. On the contrary, after ownership release, A <b>share</b> <b>premium</b> is stationary and there is cointegration relationship between A and B share markets...|$|R
