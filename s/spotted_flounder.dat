40|$|<b>Spotted</b> <b>flounder</b> Citharus linguatula (Linnaeus, 1758) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} species within demersal fish assemblages next to the continental shelf (up to 200 m depth) of the Mediterranean Sea. In spite of the ecological importance of this species in the central Tyrrhenian Sea, many aspects of its biology (e. g. feeding behaviour) are poorly described. In order to analyze how feeding habits are related to the ontogenetic changes in this species, 2636 specimens (between 9 and 26 cm of total length TL) were collected from November 2000 to January 2002. During ontogenetic development <b>spotted</b> <b>flounder</b> occupied different trophic levels: diet shifted from mysids, predominantly in the smaller <b>spotted</b> <b>flounder</b> (19 cm TL). Before the transition to the icthyophagous phase, a more generalist foraging behaviour including decapods (Processa sp., Alpheus glaber), molluscs (Turitella sp.) and benthic fish (Lesuerigobius spp., Gobius niger, Callionymus spp., Arnoglossus laterna) dominated the diet. Seasonal analysis of the diet showed an increase in the presence of mysids in summer and autumn, and of decapods in summer and spring. Teleosteans are present throughout the year without significant variations. Daily ration values, computed from the Eggers method, ranged from 1. 57 % to 2. 83 % wet body weight, showing a negative relationship between reproduction and daily consumption rate...|$|E

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of fish parasite communities as bioindicators of environmental stress was tested on two benthic fish species, the red mullet (Mullus barbatus) and the <b>spotted</b> <b>flounder</b> (Citharus linguatula), {{during the spring}} of 2006 at two sites of the Catalan coast (northwestern Mediterranean) : an anthropogenic-impacted area located close to the city of Barcelona, and a less polluted area close to Blanes (Girona). Gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices and condition factor were determined for the fishes caught. Prevalence, mean intensity, mean abundance and species richness of the parasites found in the survey were calculated for both species and locations, and the main histological alterations were recorded. Cysts of unknown aetiology and intestinal coccidians were reported only in red mullets from the area close to Barcelona, which were highly parasitized by the digenean Opecoeloides furcatus and the nematode Capillaria sp. However, a higher prevalence of Ichthyophonus sp. was reported in the <b>spotted</b> <b>flounder</b> from Blanes. Cysts of unknown aetiology, some nematodes and Ichthyophonus sp. may be associated with pollution...|$|E

Length-weight relationships (LWRs), sex ratio and condition factor of the fish specimens were investigated. Within collected C. linguatula samples, most of the individuals ranged from 10. 0 to 15. 0 cm (80. 15 %), the minimum and maximum total lengths of the specimens were 7. 0 and 18. 5 cm, respectively. Negative allometric growth were observed for male, female and both sexes. The sex ratio (females: males) was 1 : 1. 04. Length-weight relationships for females, males and both sexes, were calculated as W= 0. 0099 TL 2. 874, W= 0. 0086 TL 2. 920 and W= 0. 0092 TL 2. 896, respectively Fulton’s condition factor (KF) values for female (0. 7228) and male (0. 7095) specimens also showed significant variations (P< 0. 01) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{demersal}} trawl fishery of {{the north}} Tunisian coast primarily targets the deep-water rose shrimp, Parapenaeus longirostris, and secondarily a variety of demersal fish species. These fishes include hake (Merluccius merluccius), common pandora (Pagellus erythrinus), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), surmullet (Mullus surmuletus), Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), bogue (Boops boops), picarel (Spicara smaris) and <b>spotted</b> <b>flounder</b> (Citharus linguatula). A bioeconomic model {{was used to test}} management measures through scenarios that ran over eleven years to estimate the viability of the fishery according to biological and economic results. The most beneficial scenario was the combination of several management measures including a temporal closure of two months, the replacement of the 40 mm diamond mesh codend with 40 mm square mesh, the removal of both the biological recovery tax and of fuel subsidies, and an 83 % reduction in fishing capacity. This results in an annual private profit higher by 9. 3 M TND (Tunisian Dinar) (6. 9 M USD) that of 2008, and an economic rent that was higher by 13. 3 M TND (9. 9 M USD) than {{by the end of the}} projected period. Shrimp and fish biomasses have doubled compared with 2008, and trawling damages would be reduced to the equivalent of a five- fold reduction in fishing effort. This study shows that the objectives of improving demersal ecosystems and improving individual and collective wealth can be achieved through the synergistic effects of various regulatory measures...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDietary {{studies of}} seabirds provide {{information}} on food webs and oceanographic variability. Studying fatty acid signatures (FAS), which reflect changes {{in the composition of}} the diet, has several advantages over traditional methods. In the context of the Mediterranean marine ecosystem, we studied tissue FAS in captive-fed and wild seabirds. Yellow-legged gulls Larus michahellis were experimentally fed either pelagic (sardine Sardina pilchardus) or demersal (<b>spotted</b> <b>flounder</b> Citharus linguatula) fish for 8 wk, and FAS in the birds' plasma and adipose tissue were studied. The FAS developed patterns characteristic of the sardine or flounder diet, showing the reliability of both types of samples. In addition, plasma samples of 20 endangered wild Balearic shearwaters Puffinus mauretanicus and their most likely prey items from the Mediterranean Sea were collected and analyzed for FAS. Based on FAS of Mediterranean fish, and the results from the feeding experiment, the diet of the endangered wild shearwaters was estimated. In terms of the composition of polyunsaturated fatty acids, the plasma FAS of the shearwaters resembled those of the captive gulls kept on a sardine diet, suggesting that pelagic feeding resources dominate shearwater diet. However, the high level of 20 : 1 n- 11, likely metabolized from 22 : 1 n- 11 by the birds themselves, suggested that the diet also contained a demersal component rich in 22 : 1 n- 11. Contrary to the situation in the open oceans, the levels of the C 20 and C 22 monounsaturated fatty acids are low in the Mediterranean food web and characteristic of most demersal species. Our results support the findings of previous field studies that the diet of the shearwaters is frequently supplemented by demersal fish from fishery discards...|$|E

50|$|Rhombosolea leporina {{is part of}} the {{flounder}} family Pleuronectidae, {{where all}} species have both eyes {{on the right side of}} their bodies. This ocular side is a dark olive green, with dark-edged, smooth scales. The underside/blindside is usually white in juveniles, eventually becoming yellow with dark <b>spots</b> as the <b>flounder</b> matures. Adult flounders have long, oval shaped bodies, with small eyes that are set further back from the pointed snout than most flounder species. They also have 13-17 rakers in each gill, on both sides of the body, and approximately 75-86 scales along the lateral line. The average length of adults is between 25-40 cm, with some female reaching up to 45 cm. Females are on average longer and heavier than males.|$|R
50|$|Estuarine {{ecosystems}} are fundamentally important and {{necessary to protect}} through the management of freshwater inflow because of the many ecosystem services they produce. An ecosystem service is something provided by nature that is of value to humans. Estuarine {{ecosystems are}} among the most productive ecosystems on the planet. Estuaries house such species as the blue crab, red fish, <b>flounder,</b> <b>spotted</b> seatrout, and many others for some point of the species’ life cycle. Marine habitats, such as those found in estuarine ecosystems, are valued at providing an estimated US14$ trillion worth of ecosystem goods and services annually, or 43% of the global total. Some economically important estuarine habitats include tidal flats, salt marshes, sea grass beds, oyster reefs, and mangroves. This is why estuaries are important to protect and conserve.|$|R
25|$|Commercial fishing {{has always}} been an {{important}} component of the island economy. Historically, this trade included whaling and the hunting of dolphins. Until ice became available in the 1920s, the primary commercial catch was mullet, which was caught near the beaches of Shackleford Bank and Core Bank and salted on shore. In the late 19th century, the Core Sound area produced 80% of the salted mullet sold on the United States east coast. An ice plant was built in nearby Beaufort in 1920, and fish houses were established on the island to process fish and shellfish. Some bay areas on the north side of the island have been developed for harvesting cultured shellfish. In addition to mullet, the commercial fishing industry of Harkers Island brings in oysters, clams, shrimp, scallops, crabs, <b>spot,</b> croaker, trout, <b>flounder,</b> bluefish, and mackerel.|$|R
