Methods Children with a diagnosis of cerebral palsy at five years of age were identified from amongst participants in a long-term follow-up program of preterm infants. The comparison group was a <b>subcohort</b> of infants randomly selected from all infants enrolled in the program. The placentas were examined histopathologically for chorioamnionitis and funisitis, and the chorioamnionic interface was aseptically swabbed and comprehensively cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeast and genital mycoplasmas. Associations between obstetric and demographic variables, indicators of chorioamnionitis and cerebral palsy status were examined by univariate analysis.

We investigated whether age-and-sex-specific stroke incidence rates and associated risk factors as well as preventive medication use have changed in Rotterdam in the Netherlands {{during the last two}} decades. The study was part of the Rotterdam Study, a large population-based cohort study among elderly people. Participants were 10, 994 men and women aged 55 – 94  years who were stroke-free at baseline. Trends were calculated by comparing the 1990 <b>subcohort</b> (n =  7516; baseline 1990 – 1993) with the 2000 <b>subcohort</b> (n =  2883; baseline 2000 – 2001). Poisson regression was used to calculate incidence rates and incidence rate ratios in age-and-sex-specific strata. We further compared the prevalence of stroke risk factors and preventive medication use in the two subcohorts. In the 1990 <b>subcohort</b> 467 strokes occurred during 45, 428 person years; in the 2000 <b>subcohort</b> 115 strokes occurred in 18, 356 person years.

Thus, we also include a similar analysis for some selected types of <b>subcohorts</b> 17 in Figs. 8 and 9 in Appendix Appendix 4. Simulation results. As expected, the variation in productivity endowment ω does not imply heterogeneity in welfare effects. Yet, differences in preference parameters drive substantial dispersion in the observed welfare effects. In fact, the minimum welfare group from Fig. 6 consists mostly of individuals with high preference for leisure and high impatience, while the opposite holds for the maximum welfare group. Acknowledging these differentiations, two main conclusions emerge. First, {{the sign of the}} median agent is preserved even for the extreme combinations of the preference parameters, which implies that the earlier conclusion is not a result of a fairly ad hoc definition of the instantaneous minimum or maximum but a feature of the reform. Second, the paths of welfare effects are strikingly similar across the pension systems. These results show that the welfare effects of increasing the retirement age are indeed universal, i.e., agents with low patience, high preference for leisure, and low productivity endowment have the same sign of the welfare effect as the representative agent.

40|$|International audienceABSTRACT BACKGROUND: It has {{recently}} been proposed that major depression disorder (MDD) may, in a heterogeneous population-based cohort, be interpreted {{in terms of a}} random-mood model. Mood fluctuations are thought to result from stressors that occur randomly in time. We have investigated whether this concept also holds for more homogeneous groups, defined by known determinants for MDD, and whether the model's parameters, susceptibility (Z) and relaxation time (T), may be evaluated and used to differentiate between <b>subcohorts.</b> MethodFrom a large epidemiological survey, the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS), data on the duration of MDD were obtained for <b>subcohorts,</b> based on gender, severity of depression, recurrence and co-morbidity with dysthymia, anxiety and somatic disorder, and were compared with random-mood simulation calculations. RESULTS: Susceptibility, Z, is empirically found to be proportional to incidence and may be identified with a risk ratio. A second scaling rule states the proportionality of mean duration with the product of Z and T. This Z-T classification proves to be more sensitive than conventional significance tests. Notably for men/women and for co-morbid anxiety, differences are seen that have previously gone unnoticed. CONCLUSIONS: Depression may be conceptualized as a disorder resulting from random-mood fluctuations, the response to which is influenced by a large variety of determinants or risk factors. The model's parameters can be evaluated and may be used in differentiating between risk factor-defined subgroups...|$|R

BackgroundThe presently recommended 14 ng/l cut point for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction using the hs-cTnT assay was derived from small studies of presumably healthy individuals, with relatively little phenotypic characterization. MethodsData were included from 3 well-characterized population-based studies: the Dallas Heart Study (DHS), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, and the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). Within each cohort, reference subcohorts were defined excluding individuals with recent hospitalization, overt cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease (<b>subcohort</b> 1), and further excluding those with subclinical structural heart disease (<b>subcohort</b> 2). Data were analyzed stratified by age, sex, and race. ResultsThe 99 th percentile values for the hs-cTnT assay in DHS, ARIC, and CHS were 18, 22, and 36 ng/l (<b>subcohort</b> 1) and 14,  21, and 28 ng/l (<b>subcohort</b> 2), respectively. These differences in 99 th percentile values paralleled age differences across cohorts. Analyses within sex/age strata yielded similar results between cohorts. Within each cohort, 99 th percentile values increased with age and were higher in men. More than 10 % of men 65 to 74 years of age with no cardiovascular disease in our study had cardiac troponin T values above the current myocardial infarction threshold.

Objectives We evaluated whether genetic variation in CYP 3 A genes influences {{the association}} between prenatal exposure to MeHg and child neuropsychological development. Methods The study population included 2639 children from three birth cohort studies: two <b>subcohorts</b> in Seychelles (SCDS) (n = 1160, 20 and 30 months of age, studied during the years 2001 – 2012), two <b>subcohorts</b> from Spain (INMA) (n = 625, 14 months of age, 2003 – 2009), and two <b>subcohorts</b> from Italy and Greece (PHIME) (n = 854, 18 months of age, 2006 – 2011). Total mercury, as a surrogate of MeHg, was analyzed in maternal hair and/or cord blood samples. Neuropsychological development was evaluated using Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID). Three functional polymorphisms in the CYP 3 A family were analyzed: rs 2257401 (CYP 3 A 7), rs 776746 (CYP 3 A 5), and rs 2740574 (CYP 3 A 4). Results There was no association between CYP 3 A polymorphisms and cord mercury concentrations. The scores for the BSID mental scale improved with increasing cord blood mercury concentrations for carriers {{of the most active}} alleles (β[95 % CI]: = 2. 9 [1. 53, 4. 27] for CYP 3 A 7 rs 2257401 GG + GC, 2. 51 [1. 04, 3. 98] for CYP 3 A 5 rs 776746 AA + AG and 2. 31 [0. 12, 4. 50] for CYP 3 A 4 rs 2740574 GG + AG).

Standardised {{mortality}} ratios were computed for major causes of death by comparing with the counterparts of the general Japanese male population. The SMR for all causes of death was 0. 82 (p less than 0. 001) and the SMR values for cerebrovascular diseases, pneumonia and bronchitis, peptic ulcer, liver cirrhosis, cancer of the respiratory organs, and cancer of the lung were all significantly smaller than unity.

We found that all of the proposed analysis methods performed reasonably well and were more efficient than a randomly sampled case-cohort sample.

40|$|Abstract: Human {{mortality}} {{data show}} stabilization in mortality rates at very late ages. But human mortality data {{are difficult to}} interpret because they are affected by changing medical practices and other historically variable causes of death. However, in the 1990 s, data {{from a variety of}} labs showed that the mortality rates of medflies, fruit flies, wasps, yeasts, and nematodes also stabilize at very late ages. These reproducible “mortality-rate plateaus ” forced biologists to develop theories for their existence. There are two main theories of this kind. “Lifelong heterogeneity ” theories suppose that highly robust <b>subcohorts</b> are more abundant at later ages because less robust <b>subcohorts</b> have mostly died off. On this type of theory, aging does not stop; aging continues inexorably in all individuals. In contrast, in evolutionary theories for mortality-rate plateaus, based on the eventual plateaus in Hamilton’s Forces of Natural Selection at late ages, aging does indeed stop. A variety of experiments have cast doubt on lifelong heterogeneity theories as explanations of mortality-rate plateaus. A few experiments have corroborated the Hamiltonian theory. This has the important corollary that it appears to be possible for aging to stop, at sufficiently late ages, at least among some populations. The implications of this result for aging research are profound. Most importantly, it suggests the possibility that the physiology of adults undergoing aging may be substantially different from the physiology of life after aging...|$|R

Methods: Patients newly diagnosed with ALL from January, 2005 to December, 2008 at Saint Mary’s Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, who completed treatment with chemotherapy only were included (n&# 61; 107). Random glucose, BMI, and Z-BMI were recorded at 5 intervals: at diagnosis, before maintenance treatment, at completion of maintenance treatment, and 6 and 12 months after completion of maintenance treatment.

PARTICIPANTS [...] Participants were 18, 878 women, the cumulated members of a pension fund for manual workers between 1970 and 1986. MAIN RESULTS [...] A healthy worker effect was observed in the total cohort. The study was then restricted to those who had contributed to the pension fund any time after reaching 20 years of age, and a 10 year latency period was instituted. When analysing <b>subcohorts</b> by duration of employment the standardised mortality ratios for all causes of death and all cancers increased with longer employment time up to 10 years. However, the ratios were low in the group with over 10 years of employment. Those who began contributing to the fund in 1977 or later had higher mortality than those who began earlier.

40|$|The human T-cell {{lymphotropic}} virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) is the causative agent of HTLV- 1 -associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HT). Although {{it is widely}} believed that virus infection and host immune response are involved in the pathogenic mechanisms, the role of the immune system in the development and/or maintenance of HT remains unknown. We performed an analysis of the peripheral blood leukocyte phenotype for two different <b>subcohorts</b> of HTLV- 1 -infected individuals to verify the existence of similar immunological alterations, possible laboratory markers for HT. The leukocyte population balance, the activation status of the T lymphocytes, and the cellular migratory potential of T lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils were evaluated in the peripheral blood of HTLV- 1 -infected individuals classified as asymptomatic individuals, oligosymptomatic individuals, and individuals with HT. Data analysis demonstrated that a decreased percentage of B cells, resulting in an increased T cell/B cell ratio and an increase in the CD 8 + HLA-DR+ T lymphocytes, exclusively in the HT group could be identified in both <b>subcohorts,</b> suggesting its possible use as a potential immunological marker for HT for use in the laboratory. Moreover, analysis of likelihood ratios showed that if an HTLV- 1 -infected individual demonstrated B-cell percentages lower than 7. 0 %, a T cell/B cell ratio higher than 11, or a percentage of CD 8 + HLA-DR+ T lymphocytes higher than 70. 0 %, this individual would have, respectively, a 12 -, 13 -, or 22 -times-greater chance of belonging to the HT group. Based on these data, we propose that the T cell/B cell ratios and percentages of circulating B cells and activated CD 8 + T lymphocytes in HTLV- 1 -infected patients are important immunological indicators which could help clinicians monitor HTLV- 1 infection and differentiate the HT group from the asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic groups...|$|R
