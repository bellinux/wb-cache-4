40|$|Dissolved {{carbohydrate}} {{obtained from}} 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]Cl) pretreated sago waste was saccharified by Amberlyst 15 (A 15) {{to study the}} kinetics of the ionic liquid-mediated solid acid saccharification of the lignocellulosic biomass. Besides the kinetics of both reducing <b>sugars</b> <b>production</b> and reducing sugars degradation reactions, emphasis {{was given to the}} recovery and reusability of the ionic liquid and solid acid catalyst. The hydrolysis reaction follows a first order sugars production-first order sugars degradation reaction that agreed well with the generalized Saeman kinetic model. Both the rates of reducing <b>sugars</b> <b>production</b> and degradation varied with temperature and catalyst loading. Higher temperature and catalyst loading promoted the rates of <b>sugars</b> <b>production</b> reaction more than the rate of degradation reaction. This is evident from the relatively larger rate constant of <b>sugars</b> <b>production</b> (k(1)) than the rate constant of degradation (k(2)). The activation energy for <b>sugars</b> <b>production</b> and degradation was 125. 1 kJ mol(- 1) and 60. 8 kJ mol(- 1) respectively. These values are lower than the literature reported values for sulfuric acid-catalyzed saccharification confirming its employment suitability for reducing <b>sugars</b> <b>production.</b> The good recovery of [BMIM]Cl and good reusability of A 15 further substantiated the feasibility of the process. The recovery of ionic liquid was improved by employing a multiple step aqueous biphasic system in this study. Approximately 60 % of the ionic liquid was recovered by 3 -step aqueous biphasic system. This finding is on par with the reported literatures using aqueous biphasic system to recover ionic liquid. Equally robust, the solid acid catalyst regained its saccharification performance after regeneration for a total of three cycles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Pretreatment is important for improving the enzymatic digestibility of lignocelluloses to increase the yield of fermentable sugars. Alkaline (sodium hydroxide and lime (calcium hydroxide)) pretreatment of coastal bermudagrass for enhanced reducing sugars recovery was investigated in this study. The effect of NaOH pretreatment at 121 °C using 1 %, 2 % and 3 % (w/v) NaOH for 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes was evaluated first. Lower NaOH concentrations (0. 5 % and 0. 75 %) and lower temperatures (50, 80 and 100 °C) were then examined. Lime (0. 1 g Ca(OH) 2 /g raw biomass) pretreatment of the biomass was conducted at room temperature, 50 °C, 80 °C, and 121 °C. Total reducing sugars, glucose and xylose were analyzed. The optimal NaOH pretreatment conditions at 121 °C for glucose and xylose production are 15 minutes and 0. 75 % NaOH. However, to maximize total reducing <b>sugars</b> <b>production,</b> pretreatment at 121 °C for 30 minutes using 1 % NaOH is needed.

The combined action of temperature (13 - 61 degrees C) and pressure (80 - 216 MPa) on the catalytic activity of naringinase was investigated at pH 4. 0 using naringin as the substrate. The choice of experimental domains resulted from preliminary studies. Naringinase activity, for naringin hydrolysis at pH 4. 0, could be described by a convex surface with a maximum of 0. 13 mM min(- 1), at 41 degrees C and 158 MPa.
