5|$|The {{context-sensitive}} button mechanic {{allows one}} button {{to serve a}} variety of functions, such as talking, opening doors, and pushing, pulling, and throwing objects. The on-screen display shows what action, if any, the button will trigger, determined by the situation. For example, if Link is holding a rock, the context-sensitive button will cause Link to throw the rock if he is moving or targeting an object or enemy, or place the rock on the ground if he is <b>standing</b> <b>still.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} I'm All Right Jack, Sellers {{returned to}} record {{a new series of}} The Goon Show. Over the course of two weekends, he took his 16mm cine-camera to Totteridge Lane in London and filmed himself, Spike Milligan, Mario Fabrizi, Leo McKern and Richard Lester. Originally intended as a private film, the eleven-minute short film The Running Jumping & <b>Standing</b> <b>Still</b> Film was screened at the 1959 Edinburgh and San Francisco film festivals. It won the award for best fiction short in the latter festival, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Short Subject (Live Action). In 1959 Sellers released his second album, Songs For Swinging Sellers, which—like his first record—reached number three in the UK Albums Chart. Sellers's last film of the fifties was The Battle of the Sexes; a comedy directed by Charles Crichton.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a long shot {{of a group of}} dancers who have just {{finished}} rehearsing a dance routine. As the dancers walk out of view, Rihanna walks onto the middle of the floor, where the singer turns, and faces the camera, and closes her eyes. <b>Standing</b> <b>still,</b> Rihanna begins to click her fingers, whereby the screen begins to cut between a scene of Rihanna, who is noticeably in a different setting, and black fades. As the song's audio begins to play, it becomes apparent that the setting has changed from a rehearsal studio into a nightclub, which Rihanna in the centre. The scene is fairly dark with different colour lights projected into different areas of the nightclub, as dancers infiltrate the dance floor surrounding Rihanna. This scene is used for the first verse-chorus-verse part of the song, but changes to a scene of Rihanna, accompanied by several dancers, situated in a gym locker room for the second chorus. For the bridge, the scene changes back to Rihanna in the nightclub, but this time in a different change of attire. This scene is used for the final chorus. The video ends with a close-up of Rihanna in the nightclub <b>standing</b> <b>still</b> as the audio finishes, where she closes her eyes, which prompts the scene to change back to Rihanna {{in the middle of the}} rehearsal studio from the beginning of the video, to which she walks out of view of the camera.|$|E
5|$|This species forages in {{the early}} morning or late {{afternoon}} either alone or in small groups in leaf litter and on dead tree trunks. It is also known to leap upwards to grab prey on overhanging foliage. It looks for its prey either by <b>standing</b> <b>still</b> and scanning the surrounding area or by tossing the leaf litter away with its beak. It also frequently follows columns of Dorylus ants, feeding on the insects flushed by the ants. It also is known to hunt in streams for crabs and fish. It crushes snails with its beak and, if its prey struggles, smashes it against the ground. While an uncommon occurrence, male rockfowl have been observed giving food to a female.|$|E
5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the reflected wave is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the amplitude of the two waves will add. There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus reflected) wave appears to be <b>standing</b> <b>still</b> on the line and is called a standing wave.|$|E

5|$|For {{passenger}} {{service the}} F40PH has another electrical alternator, the head-end generator. The HEP unit generates three-phase AC power at 480 V (500kW {{on the first}} order, 800kW on later units) for lighting, heating and air-conditioning the train. Originally, F40PHs powered the HEP alternator from the prime mover; from the head end to the train must be a constant frequency, and the prime mover had to turn at a constant 893 RPM while supplying head end power (even <b>standing</b> <b>still,</b> with the throttle in idle). Power to the traction motors was controlled by varying the field excitation of the main (traction) generator. On some later versions of the F40PH (and on many rebuilt F40s), a second small diesel engine {{at the rear of}} the locomotive powers the HEP alternator. In these engines, the prime-mover speed varies in the usual way; they can be identified by the diesel exhaust {{at the rear of the}} locomotive and by their quiet idle. Remaining F40s, with the constant-RPM prime movers, are noticeably louder.|$|E
5|$|Much of Bloodlines {{criticism}} {{focused on}} technical problems {{when it was}} released, undermining the game experience or making it unplayable. Several reviewers noted errors which closed the game and typographical errors in on-screen text. Others cited frequent, sometimes-lengthy load times encountered while moving between hubs and entering or exiting buildings and areas. GameSpot called the game's artificial intelligence poor, often causing enemies to rush at an armed player, fire at them from too great a distance to be effective or become immobilized {{while waiting for the}} player's next attack. IGN noted that stealth broke the AI, allowing traps to be triggered and leaving the assailants <b>standing</b> <b>still,</b> unable to locate a hidden player. GameSpy said that the Source engine was Bloodlines greatest weakness; although the RPG aspects were the game's strong suit, features of the Source engine, such as first-person shooting, were where it stumbled.|$|E
5|$|With the {{increasing}} Soviet resistance, a plan {{was made to}} concentrate on only one target. It was decided to halt the Ukhta-offensive and instead support the advance east of Kestenga in mid-August. This new drive {{was able to make}} some ground in the arctic no-man's land, but no decisive breakthrough could be achieved. The increasing Soviet activity also worried Siilasvuo, especially as Group F was now <b>standing</b> <b>still</b> in exposed terrain, open to a possible Soviet encirclement. To counter this, AOK Norwegen decided to bolster the Finnish forces for a final push to the east {{and the rest of the}} SS Nord division was moved south and put under Finnish command. Also parts of 6th Finnish Division were now moved south and returned to the Finnish III Corps for more reinforcements. Once the reorganisation had been completed, a new, final attack had to be launched by both Finnish battlegroups in October.|$|E

5|$|Adopted {{from the}} Grand Theft Auto series, Red Dead Redemption has a {{modified}} wanted system. When the player commits a crime such as killing people near witnesses, some will {{run to the}} nearest police station. The player can bribe them or kill them {{before they reach the}} station. If a crime is committed near a police officer, the wanted meter immediately appears along with a bounty count which increases with each crime committed. If Marston's bounty becomes high enough he will be pursued by either the U.S. Marshals or by the Mexican Army depending on his locations. To evade law enforcement in pursuit, John Marston must escape a circular zone until the wanted meter disappears. Alternatively, the player character can kill all lawmen in a town to have the wanted meter disappear. Despite the chase being aborted, a bounty is placed upon John which will cause bounty hunters to come after him in the wilderness. It is impossible to surrender to these bounty hunters by putting away Marston's weapon and <b>standing</b> <b>still</b> as they will kill him regardless. Only law enforcement in towns and a posse will accept surrenders. The law will continue to chase Marston unless he pays his bounty at a telegraph station or presents a pardon letter. When arrested, Marston pays off his bounty and is then released. If the player does not have enough money to pay back the bounty, the law will assign bounty hunting activities.|$|E
5|$|This rockfowl usually lives either {{alone or}} in pairs, {{although}} small flocks of three to ten birds are not uncommon. It normally moves through its habitat {{in a series of}} runs and long, springing hops on the ground and in low branches. It uses its tail for balance while hopping and running. When in a flock, rockfowl hop almost in unison. In the unusual occurrences when the species does fly, it is fast and is capable of navigating through the trees and rocks well. When it is <b>standing</b> <b>still,</b> the rockfowl has its tail down and its head looking up. Typically, it silently evades any unusual movements in their forest. However, if these birds know that they have been sighted, they can become quite inquisitive and occasionally approach observers. This is not a shy species once it knows that it has been seen, and often studies things of interest, including humans, from an open location. When this species is suspicious, it raises the small crown on its head and the ruff on its neck while uttering a muffled groan. It is most active in the early morning and late evening, and from 10:30 am to 7:00 pm remains perched with little activity either in liana-tangled areas or in caves away from the nests. To scratch its head, the species lifts its foot over its head. It bathes in small pools. While its lifespan in the wild is unknown, it has lived up to 25 years in captivity.|$|E

25|$|Aberration may be {{explained}} as the difference in angle of {{a beam of light}} in different inertial frames of reference.

The faster the observer moves, the more tilt is needed.|$|E
