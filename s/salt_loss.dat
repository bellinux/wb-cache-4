50|$|The {{majority}} of mammals, including humans, rely on evaporative cooling to maintain body temperature.

Advantages to panting include cooler skin surface, little <b>salt</b> <b>loss,</b> and heat loss by forced convection instead of reliance on wind or {{other means of}} convection. On the other hand, sweating is advantageous in that evaporation occurs over a much larger surface area (the skin), and it is independent of respiration, thus {{is a much more}} flexible mode of cooling during intense activity such as running. Because human sweat glands are under a higher level of neuronal control than those of other species, they allow for the excretion of more sweat per unit surface area than any other species.

By ridding themselves of an insulating fur coat, running humans are better able to dissipate the heat generated by exercise.|$|E
50|$|Although land {{reclamation}} {{has been an}} important factor for <b>salt</b> marsh <b>loss</b> in the UK in the past (Allen 1992) the majority of current <b>salt</b> marsh <b>loss</b> in the UK is believed to be due to erosion (Morris et al. 2004). This erosion may involve coastal squeeze, where protective sea walls prevent the landward migration of salt marsh in response to sea level rise when sediment supply is limited (Hulme 2005; Morris et al. 2004). Salt marshes are protected under the EU Habitats Directive as well as providing habitat for a number of species protected by the Birds Directive (see Natura 2000). Following this guidance, the UK’s biodiversity action plan aims to prevent net losses to the area of salt marsh present in 1992. It is therefore a legal requirement that all losses in marsh area must be compensated by replacement habitat with equivalent biological characteristics (Crooks et al. 2001). This equates to the need to restore approximately 1.4 km² of salt marsh habitat per year in the UK.|$|R

To improve the understanding of these complex processes, the authors analyzed water, nitrogen, and salinity dynamics in a maize cropping system with CC (vetch, barley, and fallow treatment), which was introduced in the intercropping season using both an experimental and modeling approach. As compared with a control treatment, the CC reduced nitrate leaching (64 % for the barley treatment and 29 % for the vetch treatment) without increasing soil salinity. In addition, the CC reduced the top layer salinity when maize was sown. Although the CC reduced with respect to fallow the net <b>salt</b> <b>losses,</b> in these conditions, excessive irrigation to favor salt leaching was not needed and, therefore, deep-water contamination risk with nitrate was reduced...|$|R

The additive stress on the heart from increased blood pressure and heart rate often only manifests as a pathology with an additional cardiovascular problem such as hypertension. Treatment for the SNP associated hyperreninemia involves drugs to block the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system to relieve the aforementioned stresses on the heart.|$|E

The {{influence of the}} hematocrit (Hct) on the trapping of red blood cells (RBC) in the renal microvasculature {{and its effect on}} the long-term outcome following unilateral ischemia were investigated in the rat. The results showed that an increase in the duration of ischemia increased the RBC trapping, as measured by 51 Cr-labeled erythrocytes, in a dose-dependent manner. At normal Hct (46 %) the period of ischemia producing half-maximum RBC trapping was 45 minutes, whereas after hemodilution (Hct = 31 %) or hemoconcentration (Hct = 60 %) the corresponding periods were 80 and 25 minutes, respectively. Regarding the long-term outcome, 45 minutes of ischemia with a normal Hct was associated with a marked decrease in kidney weight, GFR and urine osmolarity after four weeks of recovery, which could be prevented to a large extent by hemodilution. Conversely, with hemoconcentration there was severe damage after only 25 minutes of ischemia. It is suggested that these long-term effects are attributable to RBC trapping in the microvasculature of the outer medulla, which may cause added ischemia in this area of the kidney.

In contrast, in high-ionic-strength solutions, bacteriophage kept its biological activity under static conditions, but it quickly lost its infectivity during the filtration process. Increasing the ionic strength decreased both the inactivation and the capsid breakup in the feed suspension and increased the loss of infectivity in the filtration retentate, while the numbers of MS 2 genomes were identical in both experiments. In conclusion, the effects of ionic strength on MS 2 behavior may significantly distort the results of membrane filtration processes, and therefore, the combination of classical and molecular methods used here is useful for an effective validation of the retention efficiency of ultrafiltration membranes...|$|R
