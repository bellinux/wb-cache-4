Cowen <b>says</b> <b>Paul</b> Krugman's The Conscience of a Liberal (2007) puts the [...] "cart before the horse" [...] in asking for high marginal tax rates, unionization, and an egalitarian distribution of income and wealth. The policies worked in the 1950s precisely because the real income growth was there to support them. Cowen argues that the failure to recognize the stagnation has led to poor policy ideas from the right (such as [...] "revenue generating tax cuts") and the left (redistribution of incomes). Cowen laments the [...] "exaggeration" [...] of both sides and the influence of political lobbying on economic policy. The growth in government, he says, was affordable during the period of lowhanging fruit, and the advances in transportation, industrial production, electronic communications and scientific management even facilitated it.|$|E

60|$|This {{grand old}} King dies in peace. Aldwin dies likewise, and to them succeed their sons, Alboin and Cunimund--the latter {{probably}} the prince {{who made the}} jest about the brood-mares--and they two will fight the quarrel out. Cunimund, <b>says</b> <b>Paul,</b> began the war--of course that is his story. Alboin is growing a great man; he has married a daughter of Clotaire, king of the Franks: and now he takes to his alliance the Avars, who have just burst into the Empire, wild people who afterwards founded a great kingdom in the Danube lands, and they ravage Cunimund's lands. He will fight the Lombards first, nevertheless: he can settle the Avars after. He and his, <b>says</b> <b>Paul,</b> are slain to a man. Alboin makes a drinking-cup of his skull, carries off his daughter Rosamund ('Rosy-mouth'), and a vast multitude of captives and immense wealth. The Gepidae vanish from history; to this day (<b>says</b> <b>Paul)</b> slaves either of the Lombards or the Huns (by whom he rather means Avars); and Alboin becomes the hero of his time, praised even to Paul's days in sagas, Saxon and Bavarian as well as Lombard, for his liberality and his glory. We shall see now how he has his chance at the Nibelungen hoard.|$|E

60|$|Sent for or not, King Alboin came; {{and with}} him all his army, and a mighty multitude, women, and children, and slaves; Bavarians, Gepidae, Bulgars, Sarmatae, Pannonians, Sueves, and Noricans; whose names (<b>says</b> <b>Paul)</b> remain unto this day {{in the names of}} the villages where they settled. With Alboin, too, came Saxons, twenty {{thousand}} of them at the least, with wife and child. And Sigebert king of the Franks put Suevic settlers into the lands which the Saxons had left.|$|E
60|$|He went, {{superseded}} by Longinus; {{but not to}} Constantinople. From Naples he sent (so <b>says</b> <b>Paul</b> the Deacon) to Alboin, and bade him come and try his fortune as king of Italy. He sent, too, (so says old Paul) presents to tempt the simple Lombard men--such presents as children would like--all fruits which grew in Italian orchards. Though the gold was gone, those were still left. Great babies they were, these Teutons, as I told you at the first; and Narses knew it well, and had used them for his ends for many a year.|$|E

6000|$|All these things, and a {{thousand}} times as many more, dwell in the flesh of man; and they may as soon go away from themselves as from these corruptions; yea, they may sooner cut the flesh from their bones than these motions of sin from their flesh; these will be with them in every duty--I mean, some or other of them; yea, {{as often as they}} look, or think, or hear, or speak. These are with them, especially when the man intends good in so doing: [...] "When I would do good," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Paul,</b> [...] "evil is present with me." [...] And God himself complains that [...] "every imagination of the thoughts of the heart of man is only evil," [...] and that [...] "continually" [...] (Rom 7:21; Gen 6:5).|$|E
6000|$|... [213] Here is {{the blessing}} of a hopeful companion; here is {{excellent}} counsel. Let vain professors say what they may against looking back to past experiences, it is most certainly good and right so to do; not to encourage present sloth and presumption, but to excite fresh confidence of hope in the Lord. We have David's example, and Paul's word to encourage us to this, [...] "The Lord that delivered {{me out of the}} paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine" [...] (1 Sam. 17:37); and <b>says</b> <b>Paul,</b> [...] "We had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead" [...] (2 Cor. 1:9)-(Mason).|$|E
60|$|Now, this cannot but be an {{excellent}} thing, if we consider, that by such a heart, unfeigned obedience is yielded unto him that calleth for it. 'Ye have obeyed from the heart,' <b>says</b> <b>Paul</b> to them at Rome, 'that form of doctrine which was delivered you' (Rom 6:17). Alas! the heart, before it is broken and made contrite, is quite of another temper: 'It {{is not subject to}} the law of God, neither indeed can be.' The great stir before the heart is broken, is about who shall be Lord, God or the sinner. True, the right of dominion is the Lord's; but the sinner will not suffer it, but will be all himself; saying 'Who is Lord over us?' and again, say they to God, 'We are lords, we will come no more unto thee' (Psa 12:4; Jer 2:31).|$|E
2500|$|Most Christian traditions <b>say</b> <b>Paul</b> clearly portrays {{homosexuality}} as sinful in two specific locations: , and [...] Another passage {{addresses the}} topic more obliquely: [...] Since the nineteenth century, however, {{some scholars have}} concluded that 1 Timothy, along with 2 Timothy and Titus, are not original to Paul, but rather an unknown Christian writing in Paul's name {{some time in the}} late-first-to-mid-2nd century.|$|R

[...] Likewise, Coke and Asbury commented on it <b>saying</b> <b>Paul's</b> objection here concerned the Corinthians (including laymen) and [...] "... their both eating and drinking most intemperately" [...] thereby despising the Church of God and shaming those who have nothing.|$|R
6000|$|Fifth. This godly fear also floweth from sound repentance for {{and from}} sin; godly sorrow worketh repentance, and godly repentance produceth this fear--"For behold," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Paul,</b> [...] "this self-same thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you! yea, what {{clearing}} of yourselves! yea, what indignation! yea, what fear!" [...] (2 Cor 7:10,11). Repentance {{is the effect}} of sorrow, and sorrow {{is the effect of}} smart, and smart the effect of faith. Now, therefore, fear must needs be an effect of, and flow from repentance. Sinner, do not deceive thyself; if thou art a stranger to sound repentance, which standeth in sorrow and shame before God for sin, as also in turning from it, thou hast no fear of God; I mean none of this godly fear; for that is the fruit of, and floweth from, sound repentance.|$|E
60|$|Alboin left {{a strong}} guard in Friuli, and Paul's {{ancestor}} among them, under Gisulf his nephew, and Marphrais or {{master of the}} horse, who now became duke of Friuli and warden of the marches, bound to prevent the Avars following them into their new abode. Then the human deluge spread itself slowly over the Lombard plains. None fought with them, and none gainsaid; for all the land was waste. The plague of three years before, and the famine which followed it had, <b>says</b> <b>Paul,</b> reduced the world into primaeval silence. The villages had no inhabitants but dogs; the sheep were pasturing without a shepherd; the wild birds swarmed unhurt about the fields. The corn was springing self-sown under the April sun, the vines sprouting unpruned, the lucerne fields unmown, when the great Lombard people flowed into that waste land, and gave to it their own undying name.|$|E
60|$|Answ. Sin is sin, in {{the nature}} of sin, {{wherever}} it is found. But sin as to the damning effects thereof is taken away from them unto whom righteousness is imputed for justification. Nor shall any or all the things aforementioned, though there is a tendency in every one of them to drive us unto sin, drown us, through it, in perdition and destruction. I am persuaded, <b>says</b> <b>Paul,</b> they shall never be able to do that. The apostle, therefore, doth implicitly, though to expressly, challenge sin, yea, sin by all its advantages; and then glorieth in the love of God in Christ Jesus, from which he concludeth it shall never separate the justified. Besides, it would now have been needless to have expressly here put in sin by itself, seeing before, he had argued that those he speaks of were freely justified therefrom.|$|E

60|$|To be short, what <b>says</b> <b>Paul</b> in {{the seventh}} to the Romans? what says James in the third chapter of his epistle? (ch. 3:2) And what says John in his first epistle, and first chapter? (1 John 1:9) Do they not all confess, though {{themselves}} were apostles, and so for grace and gifts beyond any that breathe in this world, that sin and iniquity was yet with them; and so consequently, {{that there was not}} as yet that departing by them therefrom, as there should. And the reason, as I have said, is, because grace is weak, weak in the beat and most strong of the saints of God. Hence the greatest saints use to complain, when much assaulted with corruptions, or attended with very hard service for God, of their weakness and insufficiency, as to a completeness of doing the will of God.|$|E
6000|$|... 3. The spiritually enlightened {{understanding}} hath also thereby received knowledge, {{that these}} excellent supernatural {{things of the}} Spirit are given by covenant in Christ to those that love God, and are beloved of him. [...] "Now we have received," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Paul,</b> [...] "not {{the spirit of the}} world (that the Pharisee had), but the Spirit which is of God, that we make know the things that are freely given to us of God;" [...] 1 Cor. ii. 12. And this knowledge, that the things of the Spirit of God are freely given to us of God, puts yet a greater edge, more vigour, and yet further confidence, into the heart to ask for what is mine by gift, by a free gift of God in his Son. But all these things the poor Pharisee was an utter stranger to; he knew not the Spirit, nor the things of the Spirit, and therefore must neglect faith, judgment, and the love of God, Matt. xxiii. 23; Luke xi. 42, and follow himself only, as to his sense, feeling, reason, and carnal imagination in prayer.|$|E
60|$|You read in Solomon's Ecclesiastes of a {{time when}} desires fail, for that 'man goeth to his long home' (Eccl 12:5). And as to good desires, there is not one of them, when we are in our prime, but they fail also as to the {{perfecting}} of that which a man desires to do. 'To will is present with me,' <b>says</b> <b>Paul,</b> 'but how to perform that which is good I find not' (Rom 7:18). To will or to desire, that is present with me, but when I have willed or desired to do, to perform is what I cannot attain to. But why not attain to a performance? Why, says he, I find a law 'in my members warring against the law of my mind'; and this law takes me prisoner, and brings 'me into captivity to the law of sin, which is in my members' (Rom 7:23). Now, where things willed and desired meet with such obstructions, no marvel if our willing and desiring, though they set out lustily at the beginning, come yet lame home in conclusion.|$|E
