5|$|Benbow's {{fame and}} success earned him both public notoriety and a {{promotion}} to admiral. He was then {{involved in an}} incident during the Action of August 1702, where {{a number of his}} captains refused to support him while commanding a squadron of ships. Benbow instigated the trial and later imprisonment or execution of a number of the captains involved, though he did not live to <b>see</b> <b>these</b> results. These events contributed to his notoriety, and led to several references to him in subsequent popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Styles {{for these}} sandstone/mortar constructions, both surface and cliff dwellings, {{included}} T-shaped windows and doors. This {{has been taken}} by some archaeologists, including Stephen H. Lekson, {{as evidence of the}} continuing reach of the Chacoan system. Other researchers <b>see</b> <b>these</b> elements as part of a more generalized Puebloan style and/or spiritual significance, rather than evidence of a continuing specific elite socioeconomic system.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Catholic Churches {{share common}} {{patrimony}} and liturgical rites as their counterparts, including Eastern Orthodox and other Eastern Christian churches who {{are no longer}} in communion with the Holy <b>See.</b> <b>These</b> include churches that historically developed in Russia, Caucasus, the Balkans, North Eastern Africa, India and the Middle East. The Eastern Catholic Churches are groups of faithful who have either never been out of communion with the Holy See or who have restored communion with it at the cost of breaking communion with their associates of the same tradition.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinction}} between coast-assault battleship and cruising battleship became blurred with the , ordered in 1880. These ships reflected developments in ironclad design, being protected by iron-and-steel compound armour rather than wrought iron. Equipped with breech-loading guns of between 12-inch and 16 ¼-inch (305mm and 413mm) calibre, the Admirals continued {{the trend of}} ironclad warships towards gigantic weapons. The guns were mounted in open barbettes to save weight. Some historians <b>see</b> <b>these</b> ships as a vital step towards pre-dreadnoughts; others view them as a confused and unsuccessful design.|$|E
5|$|Twice a year, Gifu plays hosts to {{two large}} {{fireworks}} festivals. Large numbers of visitors gather {{on the banks}} of the Nagara River between Nagara and Kinka Bridge to <b>see</b> <b>these</b> festivals, among the largest in Japan. The first festival, the Chunichi Shimbun Nagara River All-Japan Fireworks Festival, occurs on the last Saturday of July. The second, the Nagara River National Fireworks Display, occurs on the first Saturday of August. Approximately 30,000 fireworks are set off at each festival, with crowds of 400,000 and 120,000 visitors, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Even Larsson's {{good friend}} and biographist Georg Nordensvan joined the critics, {{but he could not}} sway Larsson's {{determination}} either, although Larsson probably took his criticism hardest. The archaeologist Bror Schnittger, who was probably identical to the anonymous writer who had initiated the criticism, launched additional criticism in Svenska Dagbladet against the lack of historical authenticity in the painting. The distance in dating between the objects in the painting were given as at least 2000 years and Schnittger thought that the painting was unacceptable in the museum building. Larsson stated that he intentionally included objects that would be from the distant past in relation to the setting of the painting, and that he did not <b>see</b> <b>these</b> as anachronisms, because he imagined the subjects would be antiquarians who kept ancient items as ritual objects.|$|E

5|$|Evidently {{the great}} mass of laboring men failed to {{comprehend}} the situation. Too much then, as now, capital was their enemy, not their friend. Too much then, as now, in their way of thinking, there was no limit {{to the ability of}} capital. They did not see that capital could not pay wages, buy raw material and manufacture goods unless it could sell its products and get returns. And if a few more intelligent did <b>see</b> <b>these</b> things the pressure of hungry wives and children obscured all reason and they were ready to go along on anything that offered a shadow of relief.|$|E
5|$|The choreography for {{the ballet}} was {{elaborated}} by the ballerina's father, Filippo Taglioni. The audience's prurient delight in this scandalous scene is well conveyed by the reviewer for the Revue des Deux-Mondes: A crowd of mute shades glides through the arches. All these women cast off their nuns' costume, they {{shake off the}} cold powder of the grave; suddenly they throw themselves into the delights of their past life; they dance like bacchantes, they play like lords, they drink like sappers. What a pleasure to <b>see</b> <b>these</b> light women... The set for the ballet was an innovative and striking design by Henri Duponchel and Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri. Duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for the staging, including 'English traps' for the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghosts. (Meyerbeer was led to complain that the spectacle was too much and was pushing his music into the background). Taglioni danced the Abbess only six times in Paris; she was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, (who danced the role 232 times).|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of Rogue led developers {{to create their}} own versions of the game, though their efforts were originally limited by the lack of access to Rogues source, which was not released until BSD v4.3 in 1986. These developers resorted to building games from scratch similar to Rogue but with features that they wanted to <b>see.</b> <b>These</b> versions would be distributed with source code, and along with the original Rogue source, other developers were able to create software forks of the games, adding in new monsters, items, and gameplay features, creating several dozen variants. This process was aided by switching code to languages with better data typing, including object-oriented and scripting languages, and cleaning up and modularizing the code so that contributors can better follow where changes can be made.|$|E

5|$|October 9, 1944, {{was another}} {{in a string of}} days {{consisting}} of accused men testifying on the witness stand. This day, however, Thurgood Marshall, chief counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), sat in on the proceedings. Marshall had flown to the Bay Area on a special wartime travel priority arranged by Navy Secretary Forrestal. The NAACP had given the mutiny trial top importance due to the U.S. Navy's policy of putting Negroes into dirty and dangerous jobs with no hope of advancement. Although Marshall was allowed to observe the trial, as a civilian he was ineligible to take an official role in the men's defense. After hearing five of the men defend themselves, Marshall spoke to the 50 men and then conferred with Veltmann's defense team. The next day, Marshall held a press conference, charging that Judge Advocate Coakley was handling the case in a prejudicial manner. Marshall said that, from a review of the proceedings and his conversations with the accused, he could only <b>see</b> <b>these</b> men being tried for lesser charges of individual insubordination, not mass mutiny.|$|E
