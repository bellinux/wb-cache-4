In order to scale for large networks containing hundreds and thousands of subnets, OSPF supports a two-level hierarchical routing scheme {{through the use of}} OSPF areas. <b>Subnet</b> <b>addresses</b> within an area are aggregated, and this aggregation is a crucial requirement for scaling OSPF to large AS domains, as it results in significant reductions in routing table sizes, smaller link-state databases, and less network traffic to synchronize the router link-state databases. On the other hand, address aggregation also implies loss of information about the length of the shortest path to each subnet, which in turn, can lead to suboptimal routing. In this paper, we address the important practical problem of configuring OSPF aggregates to minimize the error in OSPF shortest path computations due to subnet aggregation. We first develop an optimal dynamic programming algorithm that, given an upper bound   on the number of aggregates to be advertised and a weight-assignment function for the aggregates, computes the   aggregates that result in the minimum cumulative error in the shortest path computations for all source-destination subnet pairs. Subsequently, we tackle the problem of assigning weights to OSPF aggregates such that the cumulative error in the computed shortest paths is minimized. We demonstrate that, while for certain special cases (e. g., unweighted cumulative error) efficient optimal algorithms for the weightassignment problem can be devised, the general problem itself is¡£ ¢-hard. Consequently, we have to rely on search heuristics to solve the weightassignment problem. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to address the algorithmic issues underlying the configuration of OSPF aggregates and to propose efficient configuration algorithms that are provably optimal for many practical scenarios.

Autonomous Systems, by nature, identify an IP address range {{under the control of}} a single entity responsible for defining usage policies, routing, and administrative procedures to be applied to all machines installed in that range. In this sense, two IP addresses belonging to the same AS would have a much greater chance of exhibiting similar behavior than two IP <b>addresses</b> on <b>subnets</b> with adjacent <b>addresses</b> (the IP space), but belonging to different ASes. After all, an AS with security flaws in its policies is at risk of becoming a potential Bad Neighborhood, since the probability of machines belonging to that AS being infected and starting to send spam is high.

40|$|As {{the number}} of hosts {{attached}} to a network increases beyond what can be connected by a single local area network (LAN), forwarding packets between hosts on different LANs becomes an issue. Two common solutions to the forwarding problem are IP routing and spanning tree bridging. IP routing scales well, but imposes the administrative burden of managing <b>subnets</b> and assigning <b>addresses.</b> Spanning tree bridging, in contrast, requires no administration, but often does not perform well in a large network, because too much traffic must detour toward {{the root of the}} spanning tree, wasting link bandwidth. This paper introduces a new architecture, called SmartBridge, that combines the good features of IP routing and spanning tree bridging.

40|$|Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) {{provides}} a means of allocating and managing IP addresses dynamically over a network. An important characteristic of the DHCP server is that different hosts or network cards {{are not allowed to}} simultaneously use the same IP address in the DHCP mechanism. However, anyone can guest corresponding parameters such as IP <b>address,</b> <b>subnet</b> mask, and default gateway from the DHCP mode, and then reconfigure a static IP to access the network from DHCP mode. According to the DHCP mechanism, this study traces abnormalities of the client IP or MAC address by comparing the ARP table and DHCP binding table in this paper. This work performs the proposed method to detect abnormal hosts on both DHCPv 4 and DHCPv 6. The difference between these two tables provides illegality information to transmit to relevant routers or switching devices via the DHCP server to block the illegal user from accessing network resources. This study approach requires no source address or MAC address retrieval of the packet.

The model allows a harmonized, easily reproducible and automated EU wide assessment and comparison across countries. The Natura 2000 network is first characterised structurally in terms of simple (physically isolated) and complex sub-nets (spatially connected sites). Natura 2000 shares of complex sub-nets range from 40 % in Bulgaria to 5 % in Latvia. Second, the functional connectivity of the Natura 2000 <b>subnets</b> is <b>addressed</b> to tackle fragmentation by grey infrastructure including roads and intensive agriculture for species dispersing 500 m in average. A European-wide land use based friction map was created as a proxy of landscape suitability to measure functional (least-cost) distances between sub-nets. Functional connectivity was assessed according to two foci: one focused more on the area of subnets, another one on the inter-site landscape suitability and distances. The site area weighted index values ranges from 15 % (Denmark) to 78 % (Malta). Best connected subnets with respect to inter-site landscape and distance were in Bulgaria, Belgium, Portugal, Ireland and Malta. High shares of functionally isolated subnets were in Greece, Denmark and Portugal. Functionally isolated sites and sites of key importance for connectivity were identified for two countries. The JRC model and derived analysis constitute a potential input to help building a Green Infrastructure in Europe. It allows the connectivity of protected areas to be assessed, isolated areas to be identified. It could guide regional landscape planning of forest conservation and restoration efforts.

However, {{with the growth of}} the Internet. it has become increasingly difficult to develop and maintain accurate traffic models. While much internet traffic is legitimate, productive communications between users and services, a significant portion of Internet traffic is the result of unwanted messages sent to IP addresses without regard as to whether there is an active host at that address. In an effort to analyze unwanted traffic, tools were developed that generate statistics and plots on captured unwanted traffic to unused IP addresses. These tools were used on a four-day period of traffic received on an inactive IPv 4 class A network address space. Each class B <b>subnet</b> in this <b>address</b> space received an average of 7 million packets corresponding to 21 packets per second. Analyses were performed on a range of class B and C subnets with the intent of discovering the types of variability that are characteristic of unwanted traffic.

In an attempt to increase the students' pass rate, this study will make additional study material available to them, complying with their learning style preferences. This material will be available as elearning material on the Internet. The usage and success of elearning material implies a holistic approach towards learning styles. Learning styles consist of different interrelated learning elements. This study will make use of an action research approach comprising four phases. In the first phase, different learning styles are diagnosed by means of a literature study. The information obtained is applied to compile an interpretive questionnaire for completion by students. This questionnaire will enable the researcher to do an empirical study with regard to their learning preferences. The data obtained from the questionnaires will be analysed and information obtained will be applied to make additional module related elearning material available on the Internet. During the second phase, results obtained from the empirical investigation will be used to develop elearning material on <b>subnetting,</b> while also <b>addressing</b> the identified learning styles of participants. The elearning material is provided on the Moodle learning management system, enabling students to use it according to their own preferences. In the third phase, the success of the intervention on the elearning material is investigated. In this phase, the activities of students using the elearning material are analysed and tests and examination results processed to determine whether there is any correlation between time spent on elearning material and these results. The usage of elearning material is tested by means of an interpretive questionnaire to the students. The last part of the action research approach deals with the question of whether the research was conducted successfully. A second iteration of the process proved the results to be satisfactory.
