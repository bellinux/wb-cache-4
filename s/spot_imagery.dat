40|$|Remote sensing {{is used by}} the Department of Environment, Climate {{change and}} Water (DECCW) for mapping and {{monitoring}} the extent of woody vegetation in the State of New South Wales (NSW). In the past DECCW has relied solely on Landsat imagery to provide for these requirements but the need to map woody vegetation change in landscapes such as open woodlands with scattered trees, grasslands, and highly modified areas, has demanded the use of higher resolution imagery. Since 2007, DECCW has been developing a program for statewide monitoring of woody vegetation using <b>SPOT</b> 5 <b>imagery.</b> The methods being used to map woody vegetation change have been adapted from the SLATS Landsat approach. They includes radiometric correction of <b>SPOT</b> 5 <b>imagery,</b> cross-calibration of <b>SPOT</b> and Landsat Foliage Projective Cover (FPC) products, and development of a change index based on existing training data from Landsat monitoring. Vegetation change for the 2008 – 2009 period is currently being mapped using <b>SPOT</b> 5 <b>imagery</b> and these methods. The methods will be further refined by incorporating improved radiometric correction techniques and additional validation data as they become available.

40|$|Concentration of {{suspended}} particulate matter (SPM) {{is one of the}} major parameters that regulate the penetration of light into the water and hence the primary production. In this paper an algorithm for retrieving the SPM concentration from satellite borne <b>SPOT</b> <b>imagery</b> of the North Sea is introduced. For the derivation the synergy of satellite borne Modular Optoelectronic Scanner (MOS) data and <b>SPOT</b> <b>imagery</b> is used. In a first step the SPM concentrations are retrieved from the rather coarsely gridded MOS data using existing SPM algorithms for MOS data. The resulting MOS-derived SPM concentrations are used to tune an algorithm for retrieving SPM concentrations from SPOT data. Thus the tuning of this SPOT SPM algorithm is based on a synoptic and highly accurate set of satellite-derived SPM connecting the high spectral resolution of the MOS data to the high spatial resolution of the SPOT images. The high spatial resolution of SPOT images is ideally suited to measure SPM concentrations in coastal areas like the Wadden Sea in the German Bight of the North Sea, yielding the opportunity to retrieve SPM concentrations in the small water inlets of the Wadden Sea, which are needed to validate and fine tune numerical SPM models for this area. In the inlets the concentrations vary considerably between 6 and 60 mg/l as measured by SPOT. These data are compared to in situ measurements and transport models and explained by the local current and sea state situatio...|$|E

Comparisons were made to simple DOS and COST atmospheric corrections, which derived accuracies of ~ 10 %, but HELM was significantly better.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Batang Lassa {{is among}} the lowland {{protected}} mangrove areas which contribute significantly to flora and fauna ecology, aquatic habitat, provision and preservation of water quality. Traditionally, measurement of water quality and turbidity for monitoring and managing river network were carried out by collecting water parameters from ground sampling. This method is relatively costly and time-consuming and not practical for extensively large areas. However, utilising Remote Sensing technology, which is widely used in detecting water turbidity, enable the process {{to be carried out}} in a much shorter duration of time and in a more cost-effective manner. The main objective {{of this study is to}} map and classify water turbidity using spectral reflectance of <b>SPOT</b> 5 <b>imagery</b> based on Water Quality Standard issued by the Department of Environment, Malaysia (DOE). This study demonstrates that turbidity concentration levels can be quantified using band 3 [NIR] (0. 79 - 0. 89 µm), the best single band to represent water turbidity differences.

40|$|Problem statement: Investigation of {{interaction}} of human activities and rivers has become&# 13; a important problem {{because they have}} essential role on rivers morphology. So, in this study Atrak&# 13; River in North-East of Iran has been considered. Approach: The aim {{of this research was}} to&# 13; determine human impact on the Atrak River morphology in the past and estimation of future&# 13; outcomes. Results: We used MSS, Landsat and <b>SPOT</b> <b>imageries,</b> aerial photographs with conjunction&# 13; fieldworks to determined banks erosion about 40 Km along Atrak River. Therefore, banks erosion rates&# 13; are analyzed for 2 time periods: 1956 - 1967 and 1967 - 2000 respectively. Comparison results of five&# 13; periods showed significant changes in land use around the Atrak River. River meanders were&# 13; completely varied during the last 50 years within the study region. Also, the river plan gradually went&# 13; out of meander shape and the river became straight in direction. The quantified average bank erosion&# 13; rates were found to be slow, ranging from 0. 36 - 3. 5 m year - 1 for the first and second analysis period,&# 13; respectively.

40|$|Abstract. The main {{goals of}} this study were to {{increase}} the data quality of the <b>SPOT</b> XS <b>imagery</b> for diVerentiation of several rock units and to expose the structural features of {{the southern part of the}} Sivas Tertiary Basin. With these aims, both edge enhancement and histogram equalized stretching � lters were applied to <b>SPOT</b> XS <b>imagery</b> of the southern part of the basin. Various geological observations and kinematic fault measurements formed the � eld-based components of this work. In this study, evaluations of detailed mapping work and kinematic analyses of mesoscobic fault planes were realized together with the study of image processing data. This basin is one of the most studied and important Tertiary basins in central Anatolia due to Neotethyan evolutionary processes. When the tectonostratigraphic relationships of the study region were taken into consideration, the detailed geological interpretations were evaluated according to the concept of thrust tectonics. In this region, four diVerent main thrust sheets, which moved from the south-east to the north-west, were distinguished. The most striking tectonostratigraphic and geomorphological phenomenon was observed in the contact zone of the Oligocene evaporitic sediments and Lower–Middle Miocene detritic series. Evaporites can be easily observed as décollement levels over the Lower–Middle Miocene series tectonically. The dominant compression direction for this region was exposed actively in a NW–SE direction after the Lower– Middle Miocene and was in agreement with the results of � eld and laboratory studies. 1...|$|R
