Arriving there in November 1859, the priest performed his first baptism among the local people the following month. Belcourt built a parish hall out of stone (which was used into the 1950s) and established the Farmers' Bank of Rustico. He founded a high school, where he taught until recruiting a teacher from Montreal to the island. The priest created a study group, the members of which had to agree to be teetotalers. He established a parish library, built {{with the assistance of}} 1,000 French francs a year from Emperor Napoleon III, nephew of Napoleon I. In October 1865, Belcourt resigned from his position at the parish at Rustico, and {{returned to}} Quebec for <b>some</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E

Ash layers in cores drilled from the seabed and from lakes in Turkey, however, show that the heaviest ashfall was towards the east and northeast of Santorini. The ash found on Crete is now known to have been from a precursory phase of the eruption, <b>some</b> <b>weeks</b> or months before the main eruptive phases, and it would have had little impact on the island. Santorini ash deposits were at one time claimed to have been found in the Nile delta, but this is now known to be a misidentification.|$|E
5|$|Harvard University offered Holst a lectureship for {{the first}} six months of 1932. Arriving via New York he was pleased to be reunited with his brother, Emil, whose acting career under the name of Ernest Cossart had taken him to Broadway; but Holst was dismayed by the continual attentions of press interviewers and photographers. He enjoyed his time at Harvard, but was taken ill while there: a {{duodenal}} ulcer prostrated him for <b>some</b> <b>weeks.</b> He returned to England, joined briefly by his brother for a holiday together in the Cotswolds. His health declined, and he withdrew further from musical activities.

In January 2007, Pablo marked his 100th game for the club with a rare goal to earn a draw with Racing Santander, and completed the season with 24 league games. He helped the club qualify for the 2007–08 UEFA Cup via the Intertoto Cup, and retained a regular spot in the starting eleven as Atlético finished fourth {{in the league and}} qualified for the Champions League, but mistakes in the Madrid derby in January 2008 led to both Real's goals and rekindled the fans' hostility.|$|E

He was replaced by George Meade, who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign, which was a victory for the Union, though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.|$|E
5|$|In his {{campaign}} for a fourth term, Johnson concentrated on three issues: slavery, homesteads and judicial elections. He defeated his opponent, Nathaniel G. Taylor, in August 1849, with a greater margin of victory than in previous campaigns. When the House convened in December, the party division caused by the Free Soil Party precluded {{the formation of the}} majority needed to elect a Speaker. Johnson proposed adoption of a rule allowing election of a Speaker by a plurality; <b>some</b> <b>weeks</b> later others took up a similar proposal, and Democrat Howell Cobb was elected.|$|E

Then a Republican senator blocked her nomination and that of three others for a while in retaliation for an unrelated block Democrats had put on another nominee. D'Amato objected strongly; <b>some</b> <b>weeks</b> later, the block was dropped, and Sotomayor was confirmed by unanimous consent of the full United States Senate on August 11, 1992, and received her commission the next day.|$|E
5|$|The church {{held the}} right to conduct the marriages of people {{throughout}} Manchester, not only from within its parish, until 1874. Despite this, there were no such services for the first 35 years of its existence, {{perhaps because of the}} continued popularity of the Collegiate Church as a venue for weddings but probably because the latter insisted on collecting its own fees for marriages held in other local churches, which effectively doubled the cost of being married at St John's rather than at the Collegiate Church. Later, after the rights of the Collegiate Church were curtailed, <b>some</b> <b>weeks</b> saw more than 100 marriage services at St John's in the years just before 1874.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{was born}} in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, and {{brought up in the}} working-class area of Tinsley. The family later moved to the village of Catcliffe after his father set up a (then-illegal) betting shop. This brought greater {{prosperity}} but also misery; one day Banks's disabled brother was mugged for the shop's daily takings, and died of his injuries <b>some</b> <b>weeks</b> later. Banks left school in December 1952 and took up employment as a bagger with a local coal merchant, which helped to build up his upper body strength. He spent a season playing for amateur side Millspaugh F.C. after their regular goalkeeper failed to turn up for a match; the club's trainer spotted Banks amongst the spectators and invited him to play in goal as he was aware that Banks had previously played for Sheffield Schoolboys. His performances there earned him a game in the Yorkshire League for Rawmarsh Welfare, however a 12–2 defeat to Stocksbridge Works on his debut was followed by a 3–1 home defeat, and he was dropped by Rawmarsh and returned to Millspaugh. Still aged 15, he then switched jobs to become a hod carrier.|$|E
