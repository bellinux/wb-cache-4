30|$|This article {{reports a}} method to {{estimation}} the global phase shift with two interferograms. Compared with existing methods, this method requires no pre-filtering, nor does it have specific requirement for the carrier frequency of the interferograms. During the calculation, this method {{does not require the}} selection of a window for integration. It therefore increases the algorithmic adaptability and provides easy automatic processing. The method in this article may resolve the problem of global phase shift calculation when the <b>interference</b> <b>signal</b> faces a variety of factors such as nonperiodic apodization, uneven background and modulation. It also has better precision and robustness than previous methods in scenarios of spectral aliasing between the +[*] 1 order spectrum and the zero order spectrum. The method in this article can calculate the global phase shift with only two interferograms. We believe that this method has broad potential applicability in various aspects of interferogram processing. And it could be extending to process the closed fringe patterns. In practice, this method can be used to screen out one or more sets of interferograms that meet the global phase shift needs from a series of interferograms for further calculation and analysis. This article provides the rationale and process of the calculation under this method, compares it with the existing method that needs Fourier Transform based on <b>simulated</b> <b>interference</b> <b>signals,</b> demonstrates the superiority of the method in this article, and confirms the precision of calculation with this method with data from experimental measurements.|$|R

30|$|RGPO can {{be roughly}} {{divided into three}} stages: stop delay period, towing period, and {{termination}} period. In the first period, jammers amplify and forward signals quickly to make time delay difference between the target echo and itself short enough to enter the radar range gate; due to its higher power of <b>interference</b> <b>signal,</b> the range gate cannot lock the exact <b>interference</b> <b>signal.</b> When the stop delay period ends or when the range gate locks <b>interference</b> <b>signal,</b> {{it comes to the}} second period, towing period. In this period, time delay of a jammer’s forwarding signal is gradually extended to increase distance between the <b>interference</b> <b>signal</b> and target signal in a range dimension. Because the range gate is locked in the <b>interference</b> <b>signal,</b> the target has been dragged out of the range gate gradually. Then the change rule of time delay of the <b>interference</b> <b>signal</b> can be expressed as dτ(t)/dt[*]=[*]v(t), where τ(t) and v(t) are the towing distance and towing speed, respectively. Finally, when the target is dragged out of the range gate, it comes to the termination period, in which the jammer is turned off or stops forwarding the <b>interference</b> <b>signal,</b> and the radar returns back to the search state because there is no signal within the range gate.|$|R

30|$|For all cases, {{such as in}} phases 1 to 4, we {{find the}} optimum number of relays which {{achieves}} the highest end-to-end channel capacity. The reason is that, similar to the ideal system, {{when the number of}} relay increases, the distance between each transceiver becomes shorter; thus, the power of desired signal increases and the end-to-end channel capacity increases. However, the <b>interference</b> <b>signal</b> is taken into account. When the number of relays is small, the distance between each transceiver is large; therefore, the power of <b>interference</b> <b>signal</b> is low and the end-to-end channel capacity is high. Moreover, when the number of relays is large, the power of <b>interference</b> <b>signal</b> increases. Therefore, the signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR) decreases, and the end-to-end channel capacity decreases.|$|R
