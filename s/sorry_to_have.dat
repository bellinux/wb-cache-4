25|$|We {{may have}} to ASSASSINATE {{some of the people}} you elect on Nov. 7! This could be your LAST ELECTION CHANCE, to save this Republic... <b>Sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to be so blunt, but the country is in mortal danger from our present {{government}} and our liberty is already near dead because of this government. If you are too stupid to turn things around with your vote, there are people out here like me who are willing to turn things around with guns, force and violence. We hope our method does not become necessary.|$|E
25|$|The {{fighting}} led to {{the evacuation}} of the Jewish villages of Atarot (17 May) and Neve Yaakov (18 May) near Jerusalem, and Kalya and Beit HaArava near the Dead Sea (both on 20 May), {{as well as the}} expulsion of the Jewish inhabitants of the Old City of Jerusalem. The defenders of the Jewish Quarter surrendered to the Arab Legion on 28 May 1948, this leading to the forced evacuation of all Jewish inhabitants. Before the war, the Jews of the Old City had friendly relations with their Arab neighbors and were <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to leave.|$|E
500|$|In October 2008, Ayola {{announced}} {{that she would be}} departing from Holby City {{in order to have a}} second child, stating: [...] "I've had a great time and I'll miss it. I made the decision purely because I was pregnant, but I wasn't really ready to put down the character of Kyla. I'm very <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to let her go." ...|$|E
60|$|INSPECTOR. I'm just going, gentlemen. The grounds, I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> say, <b>have</b> yielded nothing. It's {{a bit of}} a puzzle.|$|R

500|$|Ayola {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} to play Kyla, which expired in October 2008. It was announced on 11 October 2008 {{that she would be}} departing from the show {{in order to have a}} second child. Ayola said of her decision to leave: [...] "It's strange but sad at the same time. I've had a great time and I'll miss it. I made the decision purely because I was pregnant, but I wasn't really ready to put down the character of Kyla. I'm very <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to let her go".|$|E
2500|$|The young Horace Walpole, {{who was in}} Rome at the time, {{attempted}} to attend the coronation but gave up because he found the waiting interminable. He wrote to his friend and cousin Conway [...] "I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> lost {{the sight of the}} Pope's coronation, but I might have staid for seeing it till I had been old enough to be Pope myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1935 Gertrude Stein gave {{a series}} of talks in the United States that included, on January 12 and 13, a visit to Choate. Fortunately for {{literary}} posterity, her audience included both a stenographer and Dudley Fitts, critic, translator, and longtime teacher of Greek and Latin at Choate. Stein's public speaking style was extemporary, and Fitts recognized the permanent value of a stenographic transcript. After an exchange of letters, Stein authorized Fitts to oversee publication of her talk in The Choate Literary Magazine. On February 5, he sent her the page proofs, saying, [...] "I had to restore {{a great deal of}} the lecture from memory. I hope I didn't spoil anything. <b>Sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> missed entirely what you said about the noun." [...] (Fitts's typescript and the Fitts-Stein correspondence are now at Yale.) ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, Tony Blair {{announced}} a new judicial inquiry, the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, into the killing of 14 unarmed civil rights marchers in Derry in 1972. A previous investigation, the Widgery Tribunal, into the same event had been discredited. During {{the debate in the}} House of Commons, Trimble was one of few dissenting voices. He said [...] "I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to say to the Prime Minister that I think that the hope expressed by the hon. Member for Foyle (Mr. Hume) that this {{will be part of the}} healing process is likely to be misplaced. Opening old wounds like this is likely to do more harm than good. The basic facts of the situation are known and not open to dispute." [...] Reporting in 2010, The Saville Inquiry confirmed that all of the 14 killings and 13 woundings were unjustified.|$|E
2500|$|Fame and honours {{brought a}} stream of {{enquiries}} about Darwin's religious views, leading him to comment [...] "Half the fools throughout Europe write to ask me the stupidest questions." [...] He sometimes retorted sharply, [...] "I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{to inform you that}} I do not believe in the Bible as a divine revelation, & therefore not in Jesus Christ as the Son of God", and at other times was more guarded, telling a young count studying with Ernst Haeckel that [...] "Science {{has nothing to do with}} Christ; except in so far as the habit of scientific research makes a man cautious in admitting evidence. For myself I do not believe that there ever has been any Revelation. As for a future life, every man must judge for himself between conflicting vague probabilities." [...] He declined a request by the Archbishop of Canterbury to join a 'Private Conference' of devout scientists to harmonise science and religion, for he saw [...] "no prospect of any benefit arising" [...] from it.|$|E
2500|$|On June 7, Odell and Nema, a porter, went to Camp V {{to support}} the summit team. On the trip to Camp V, Odell picked up an oxygen-breathing set which had been {{abandoned}} by Irvine on the ridge {{only to discover that}} it was missing its mouthpiece. Odell carried it up to Camp V in hopes of finding an extra mouthpiece there but did not find one. Shortly after Odell arrived in Camp V, the four remaining porters who had assisted Mallory and Irvine returned from Camp VI. The porters gave Odell the following message:Dear Odell,---We're awfully <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> left things in such a mess -- our Unna Cooker rolled down the slope at the last moment. [...] Be sure of getting back to IV to-morrow in time to evacuate before dark, as I hope to. [...] In the tent I must have left a compass -- for the Lord's sake rescue it: we are without. [...] To here on 90 atmospheres for two days -- so we'll probably go on two cylinders -- but it's a bloody load for climbing. [...] Perfect weather for the job! [...] Yours ever,G MalloryAnother message carried by the porters read: ...|$|E
