5|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} William experienced, he did considerable good as Lord High Admiral. He abolished the cat o' nine tails for most offences other than mutiny, attempted {{to improve the}} standard of naval gunnery and required regular reports of the condition and preparedness of each ship. He commissioned the first steam warship and advocated more. Holding the office permitted him to make mistakes and learn from them—a process {{that might have been}} far more costly if he had not learnt before becoming King that he <b>should</b> <b>act</b> only with the advice of his councillors.|$|E
5|$|Misaki is Asuma's {{assistant}} {{and is the}} first person that Hibiki meets from Kamisaid Magic Academy. When Hibiki makes a mistake, Misaki lectures her and informs her how {{a member of the}} faculty <b>should</b> <b>act,</b> even when it may not entirely be her fault. Due to Hibiki's low magical experience, Misaki worries about Hibiki succeeding {{as a member of the}} staff. Like Hibiki, Misaki cannot perform magic, though she still has a vast knowledge of magic at her disposal. She had been adopted by a man that constantly abused her and the only thing that could cheer her up was a book from a magic user. She had been saved by Asuma and hopes to be of use to him.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, the Polish leader, Colonel Józef Beck, {{believed}} that Warsaw <b>should</b> <b>act</b> rapidly to forestall the German {{occupation of the}} city. At noon on 30 September, Poland gave an ultimatum to the Czechoslovak government. It demanded the immediate evacuation of Czechoslovak troops and police and gave Prague time until noon the following day. At 11:45a.m. on 1 October the Czechoslovak foreign ministry called the Polish ambassador in Prague {{and told him that}} Poland could have what it wanted. The Polish Army, commanded by General Władysław Bortnowski, annexed an area of 801.5km² with a population of 227,399 people. Administratively the annexed area was divided between two counties: Frysztat and Cieszyn County. At the same time Slovakia lost to Hungary 10,390km² with 854,277 inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid did {{not attend}} the Council of Hertford held in September 672, but he did send representatives. Among the council's resolutions was one postponing a {{decision}} on the creation of new dioceses, which affected Wilfrid later. Another ruling confirmed that the Roman calculation for the date of Easter should be adopted, and that bishops <b>should</b> <b>act</b> only in their own dioceses. During the middle 670s Wilfrid acted as middleman in the negotiations to return a Merovingian prince, Dagobert II, from his exile in Ireland to Gaul. Wilfrid {{was one of the first}} churchmen in Northumbria to utilise written charters as records of gifts to his churches. He ordered the creation of a listing of all benefactions received by Ripon, which was recited at the dedication ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{function}} by binding {{to specific}} locations on target molecules and causing some desired change, such as disabling a target or causing a conformational change. Ideally, a drug <b>should</b> <b>act</b> very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, {{it is difficult}} to precisely determine where and how tightly two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current in silico methods usually must trade speed for accuracy; e.g., use rapid protein docking methods instead of computationally costly free energy calculations. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability. Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery. In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the villin protein to within 1.8 angstrom (Å) root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the crystalline structure experimentally determined through X-ray crystallography. This accuracy has implications to future protein structure prediction methods, including for intrinsically unstructured proteins. Scientists have used Folding@home to research drug resistance by studying vancomycin, an antibiotic drug of last resort, and beta-lactamase, a protein that can break down antibiotics like penicillin.|$|E

25|$|The European Union {{operates}} {{according to}} the principles of conferral (which says that it <b>should</b> <b>act</b> only within the limits of the competences conferred on it by the treaties) and of subsidiarity (which says that it <b>should</b> <b>act</b> only where an objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states acting alone). Laws made by the EU institutions are passed in a variety of forms. Generally speaking, they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures (regulations) and those which specifically require national implementation measures (directives).|$|E

25|$|One of the {{consequences}} of general relativity is that massive objects (such as a cluster of galaxies) lying between a more distant source (such as a quasar) and an observer <b>should</b> <b>act</b> as a lens to bend the light from this source.

25|$|The {{marriage}} contract—without which, the Code {{ruled that}} the woman was no wife—usually stated the consequences to which each party was liable for repudiating the other.

25|$|The last {{record of}} a living Domhnall comes from 1297, and the {{earliest}} record of his son Gartnait as Mormaer is from 1305, creating the range of Domhnall's possible year of death to somewhere in between these two points. However, a document dating to 1302, containing terms of reconciliation between Edward I and Robert, stipulates that Robert <b>should</b> <b>act</b> as warden of Gartnait, implying that Domhnall had just died.|$|E
25|$|Despite the momentous event, Lee did {{not call}} for the {{parliament}} to convene to reconcile issues that Singapore would face immediately as a new nation.

According to Dr Toh Chin Chye, the parliament hung in suspended animation until the sitting in December that year.|$|E
