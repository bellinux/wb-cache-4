40|$|Tributyltin (TBT) and {{triphenyltin}} (TPT) are emblematic endocrine disruptors, {{which have}} been mostly studied in gonochoric prosobranchs. Although both compounds can simultaneously occur in the environment, they have mainly been tested separately for their effects on snail reproduction. Because large discrepancies in experimental conditions occurred in these tests, the present study aimed at comparing the relative toxicity of TBT and TPT under similar laboratory conditions in the 0 â€“ 600 ng Sn/L range. Tests were performed on the simultaneous hermaphrodite Lymnaea stagnalis, a freshwater snail in which effects of TPT were unknown. Survival, shell length and reproduction were monitored in a 21 d <b>semi-static</b> <b>test.</b> Frequency of abnormal eggs was assessed as an additional endpoint. TPT hampered survival while TBT did not. Major effects on shell solidity and reproduction were observed for both compounds, reproductive outputs being more severely hampered by TBT than by TPT. Considering the frequency of abnormal eggs allowed increasing test sensitivity, since snail responses to TBT could be detected at concentrations as low as 19 ng Sn/L. However, the putative mode of action of the two compounds could not be deduced from {{the structure of the}} molecules or from the response of apical endpoints.

40|$|The {{hermaphroditic}} gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis {{is proposed}} {{as a candidate}} species {{for the development of}} OECD guidelines for testing of the reprotoxicity of chemicals, including endocrine active substances (EASs). Up to now, only a few putative EASs have been tested for their reproductive toxicity in this species. In this study, we investigate the effects of four EASs with different affinities to the vertebrate estrogen and androgen receptors (chlordecone as an estrogen; cyproterone acetate, fenitrothion and vinclozolin as anti-androgens) on the reproduction of L stagnalis in a 21 -day <b>semi-static</b> <b>test.</b> Testosterone and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE 2) were used as the reference compounds. The tested EASs had no significant effect on growth and survival at the tested concentration ranges (ng to mu g/L. Classical reproduction endpoints (i. e., oviposition and fecundity) were not responsive to the tested chemicals, except for chlordecone and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, which hampered reproduction from 19. 6 mu g/L and 17. 6 mu g/L, respectively. The frequency of polyembryonic eggs, used as an additional endpoint, demonstrated the effects of all compounds except EE 2. The molecular pathways, which are involved in such reproduction impairments, remain unknown. Our results suggest that egg quality is a more sensitive endpoint as compared to other reproductive endpoints commonly assessed in mollusk toxicity tests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

In this study one of the most abundant mollusc of European limnic systems, the hermaphroditic gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis was investigated to determine the effects of endocrine modulating substances on reproductive parameters. Known endocrine modulating substances were tested using the following nominal concentrations; Tributyltin (TBT in ng Sn:l) and b-sitosterol at 1, 10 and 100 ng:l, respectively, and 4 -nonylphenol (4 -NP) at 1, 10 and 100 mg:l.

Most of the existing models currently do not include {{a representation of the}} posterior knee capsule. In order to incorporate the posterior capsule in knee models, data is needed on its mechanical properties. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the mechanical properties of the human posterior knee capsule through <b>semi-static</b> tensile <b>tests.</b> METHODS: Fifteen posterior knee capsule specimens (5 knees, 3 male, 2 female; age 79. 2 +/- 7. 9 years) were used to perform tensile tests. A medial, central and lateral specimen was taken from each knee. The cross-sectional area was measured, after which <b>semi-static</b> tensile <b>tests</b> were performed to quantify the material properties. RESULTS: The stiffness of the capsule was randomly distributed over the regions. The global Young's modulus and yield strength was 8. 58 +/- 10. 77 MPa and 1. 75 +/- 1. 89 MPa, respectively. A strong correlation (rho = 0. 900) was found between Young's modulus and yield strength. The location of failure was not associated with smallest cross-sectional area or highest strain. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the posterior knee capsule does not have a systematic (medial-central-lateral) distribution of material properties.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn this thesis {{a method for}} testing the dynamic accuracy of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) magnetic, angular rate, and gravity (MARG) sensors was developed. Many tests exist to check the static accuracy of MARG and inertial sensors or their individual components, but very few tests exist that adequately examine the dynamic accuracy of the final sensor package with sufficient precision and test repeatability. Based on a previous work that developed an inertial sensor test bench, a new test apparatus designed to model the motions of a human arm or leg was built using a rigid pendulum with MEMS MARG sensors attached on the end. Building materials were chosen to give minimal magnetic interference, and an optical encoder was used to accurately track {{the angle of the}} pendulum. A LabVIEW data acquisition system was built for data collection and a graphical user interface was written in MATLAB for easy data processing. The MicroStrain 3 DM-GX 1 and 3 DM-GX 3 sensors were tested on the new apparatus in a variety of dynamic motion tests, including free swinging in vertical and horizontal orientations, as well as "swing to impact" and <b>semi-static</b> <b>tests,</b> and their performances were compared for different target applications.

40|$|The biomass {{production}} potential (BPP) test is a <b>semi-static</b> <b>test</b> for {{assessment of the}} microbial growth promoting properties of construction products in contact with drinking water (CPDW) under strictly defined conditions. In 2003 the test was selected for incorporation into a scheme for acceptance of CPDW {{in the framework of}} the implementation of the European Construction Product Directive and Drinking Water Directive. The test is performed at a surface-to-volume contact ratio (S/V) of 0. 166 cm- 1, that {{is quite different from the}} practice in buildings and domestic installations. The goal of the study is to evaluate the importance of S/V ratio for performance of the BPP test and for correct assessment of the growth promoting properties of CPDW. The BPP of 10 pipe products were compared under the S/V ratios of 0. 166 cm- 1 and 1. 6 cm- 1. The BPP of most plastic products were higher under the S/V ratio of 1. 6 cm- 1 in individual trials. However, the differences of average BPP values between both ratios were statistically insignificant. The planktonic biomass concentrations showed 4 - 14 times stronger effect of the products on water quality at higher S/V ratio and this can be important from hygienic point of view.

Our study found out that the BPP test at the originally proposed S/V contact ratio is a reliable approach for assessment of growth promoting properties of CPDW. The data showed that under the S/V ratio of 0. 16 cm- 1 the test achieves similar results for the BPP of the tested pipe materials as with a more realistic S/V ratio of 1. 6 cm- 1. However, the S/V ratio showed a significant effect on the planktonic biomass concentration and heterotrophic plate count in the test waters in contact with the tested pipe materials and that stronger effect on the water quality can be important from hygienic point of view. Therefore, the impact of the S/V contact ratio on drinking water quality should be taken into consideration for assessment of the products in contact with drinking water. For acceptance of the CPDW, besides a Pass/Fail Criterion for the BPP, a second criterion for evaluation of materials on their effect of drinking water quality needs to be developed and the planktonic biomass concentration could be useful one for this purpose.

40|$|The OECD test {{guideline}} development {{program has been}} extended in 2011 to establish a partial life-cycle protocol for assessing the reproductive toxicity of chemicals to several mollusk species, including the great pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. In this paper, we summarize the standard draft protocol for a reproduction test with this species, and present inter-comparison results obtained in a 56 -day prevalidation ring-test using this protocol. Seven European laboratories performed <b>semi-static</b> <b>tests</b> with cultured snails of the strain Renilys (R) exposed to nominal concentrations of cadmium chloride (from 53 to 608 mu g Cd L- 1). Cd concentrations in test solutions were analytically determined to confirm accuracy in the metal exposure concentrations in all laboratories. Physico-chemical and biological validity criteria (namely dissolved oxygen content > 60 % ASV, water temperature 20 Â± 1 degrees C, control snail survival > 80 % and control snail fecundity > 8 egg-masses per snail over the test period) were met in all laboratories which consistently demonstrated the reproductive toxicity of Cd in snails using the proposed draft protocol. Effect concentrations for fecundity after 56 days were reproducible between laboratories (68 < EC 50 - 56 d < 124 mu g L- 1) and were consistent with literature data. EC 50 - 56 d and EC 10 - 56 d values were comprised within a factor of 1. 8 and 3. 6, respectively, {{which is in the}} range of acceptable variation defined for reference chemicals in OECD {{test guideline}}s for invertebrates. The inter-laboratory reproducibility coefficient of variation (CV) for the Cd LC 50 - 56 d values was 8. 19 %. The inter-laboratory comparison of fecundity within the controls gave a CV of 29. 12 %, while exposure to Cd gave a CV of 25. 49 % based on the EC 50 - 56 d values. The OECD has acknowledged the success of this prevalidation exercise and a validation ring-test involving 14 laboratories in Europe, North- and South-America is currently being implemented using four chemicals (Cd, prochloraz, trenbolone and tributyltin).

The new material can present a unique combination of properties: {{those related to}} metal/ceramic composites and still associating some characteristics of cellular materials, as the low density and high plastic deformation under compression stresses. Design/methodology/approach: processing technique involves the infiltration of AA 7075 alloy in the semisolid thixotropic state into a layer of porous ceramic particles. Products were analyzed by X-ray tomography, optical and electronic microscopy to observe microstructure and metal/ceramic interfaces. Density was measured by He picnometry; <b>semi-static</b> compression <b>tests</b> were performed to evaluate the deformation ability of the material. Thermal properties were theoretically evaluated. Findings: concerning the production method, thixoinfiltration is a feasible processing route, with no difficult control of parameters and does not rely on specific and onerous equipment. Moreover, it is flexible to different alloys. Concerning the product, low density composites can be produced with good dispersion of reinforcement and reliable internal quality; this material presents a plateau of plastic deformation at low stresses under compression, signalizing a potential application as energy absorbers. Theoretical simulations show also good thermal insulation ability. Research limitations/implications: as a new product, the full characterization of properties of the new composite is still to be achieved. Therefore, the full potential of commercial application is to be determined. The product can present limitations for application involving tensile stresses due to poor metal/ceramic interfaces.

40|$|A {{guaranteed}} minimum income benefit (GMIB) is a long-dated {{option that}} can be embedded in a deferred variable annuity. The GMIB is attractive because, for policyholders who plan to annuitize, it offers protection against poor market performance during the accumulation phase, and adverse interest rate experience at annuitization. The GMIB also provides an upside equity guarantee that resembles the benefit provided by a lookback option. We price the GMIB, and determine the fair fee rate that should be charged. Due to the long dated nature of the option, conventional hedging methods, such as delta hedging, will only be partially successful. Therefore, we are motivated to find alternative hedging methods which are practicable for long-dated options. First, we measure the effectiveness of static hedging strategies for the GMIB. Static hedging portfolios are constructed based on minimizing the Conditional Tail Expectation of the hedging loss distribution, or minimizing the mean squared hedging loss. Next, we measure the performance of semi-static hedging strategies for the GMIB. We present a practical method for <b>testing</b> <b>semi-static</b> strategies applied to long term options, which employs nested Monte Carlo simulations and standard optimization methods.

Based on its wide acceptance and high degree of standardisation, the growth test was chosen for intercalibrating exercises on 6 reference chemicals involving 5 praticipating laboratories from Denmark, The Netherlands, the USA and Germany. The aim of this internationa research effort was to work out a harmonized proposal for an OECD growth-test protocol with protozoa. Results indicate that the ciliate species Tetrahymena pyrifomis and T. thermophila are equally suited as test organisms for exotoxicological purposes. The growth assay reveals predominantly higher sensitivities for the detection of chemical pollution than the vitality or oxygen consumption tests, or even than the chemosensory response, a behavioural parameter. Both species can be tested in axenic or monoxenic culture. Effects on proliferation-rate and stationary cell-density are almost identical. The highest effect potential of the test chemicals was found in synthetic medium. Growth inhibition in axenic, particle-free cultures with synthetic or the more complex PPY-medium can be measured not only by direct cell counting, but also photometrically. Tetrahymena growth tests can be miniaturezed to microplate scale. <b>Semi-static</b> and flow-through <b>tests</b> can also be performed. The marginal deviation of the ring-test results and the comparison of EC-data with the OECD standard tests reveal the Tetrahymena growth to be a highly reproducible and sensitive parameter.

40|$|Sediments are an {{important}} sink for and source of environmental pollutants. Because of these two qualities, sediments have been acknowledged in environmental risk assessment and corresponding regulations. In case of the European Water Framework Directive (EWFD), for instance, sediments were addressed {{by means of an}} amendment published in 2008. In order to adequately response to sediment contamination within the context of this legal obligation, however, there is still a need for research in several key fields. One open question is the correlation between the effects of pollutants in sediments and factors which can potentially confound such effects. The present thesis aimed to investigate potential confounding impacts in order to identify the importance of the given influences on biotests results and eventually the assessment of sediment contamination. Impact of contact-time on results obtained in biotests appeared to be of particular priority. Hence, time-dependence of data acquired in direct sediment contact tests (SCTs) was the major focus of the given studies. Further investigated were the impacts of test vessel material, extraction methodology, and difference between single- and multi-metal exposures. A literature survey and two experimental studies were carried out in order to address the time-dependence of results obtained in SCTs. The main experimental investigation compared the impact of time on the effects of 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (DCA), fluoranthene (FA) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo SCT, the nematode SCT with Caenorhabditis elegans, and the bacterial SCT with Arthrobacter globiformis. The second experimental study assessed the impact of short-term (two week) contact-time between sediments and pollutants on bioaccumulation of FA and PCP in the earthworm species Lumbriculus variegatus. All three studies concurrently revealed that time can severely impact results of SCTs. Literature indicated a complete loss of initially observable effects within weeks and statistically significant changes in effects in different SCT which mostly utilised invertebrates. These changes in effects included both increases and decreases, depending on the respective combination of species, substances, sediments, and additional accompanying parameters. In the two experimental studies, the impact of time was sufficiently severe that distinct changes of results were observed. In the case of the fish embryo SCT, a complete loss of originally observed toxicity of all three substances was recorded within two to sixteen weeks. In the nematode contact test, low number of juveniles in comparison to controls indicated toxicity in all four tested combinations of sediments and substances. Reproduction of worms exposed to FA-spiked natural sediment increased in the test conducted after 4 weeks of contact between FA and the sediment, and reached reproduction in the controls after six weeks. In the other three combinations of sediment and substance that were tested in the nematode SCT, no changes were observed until the end of experiments after six weeks. Toxicity of PCP remained unchanged in the bacterial SCT over the course of 44 weeks in both sediments. Accumulation of PCP in earthworms significantly decreased in FA-spiked natural sediment within 13 days of ageing and exhibited no change in PCP-spiked artificial sediment and both FA-spiked sediments. In an additional study, four different sediment extraction methodologies and one corresponding SCT were intercompared with regard to biological effectiveness on zebrafish embryos: Soxhlet extraction (SOX), membrane dialysis extraction (MDE), hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin extraction (HPCD) and Tenax TAÂ® extraction (TNX). TNX was identified as a putatively suitable method for the prediction of toxicological bioavailability in the SCT with zebrafish embryos. SOX, MDE and HPCD overestimated bioaccessibility, as was expected for SOX and MDE. HPCD is a methodology that was reported to be predictive of bioaccessibility, but induced effects at least as great as effects induced by the two vigorous extraction methodologies Soxhlet and MDE. This result may be explained by short sediment-pollutant contact-time, and indicated that results obtained from different extraction methodologies can be severely altered by time. In an investigation comparing the impact of glass or plastic test vessel material on results in the aqueous zebrafish embryo test, glass vessels were shown to be better suited for testing of DCA. In the case of plastic, 16 hours of DCA-vessel contact prior to embryo exposure resulted in an almost complete loss of effects in the tested concentrations, whereas in glass vessels, an LC 50 could still be obtained. These results confirm that currently discussed measures, such as <b>semi-static</b> <b>tests,</b> passive dosing and flow-through renewal, are necessary to minimise the influence of vessel material. Furthermore, experimental timing, i. e. the exact time test compounds are introduced into test vessels, can be crucial for the outcomes of experiments. The final study assessed uptake, accumulation, and corresponding changes in transcript abundance of selected genes in zebrafish embryos exposed to Cd-, Cu-, Ni- and Zn-spiked sediment. In terms of potentially confounding impacts, multi- vs. single-metal exposures were compared. Results emphasized the great relevance of Cu as toxicant on fish. Furthermore, it was shown that multi-metal exposure can impact uptake and bioaccumulation, most likely by means of inhibition and competition. This correlation was established for the first time concerning the zebrafish embryo sediment contact test. Literature indicated that this impact can be further influenced by additional confounding factors like pH or time. Transcript abundances were not sensitive to these changes. This finding could indicate that molecular biomarkers are more robust in their response to confounding factors than other endpoints, but needs to be further investigated. In most studies in the present thesis, a recurring comparison was conducted on the impact of sediment type, either artificial or natural sediment, on results in spiking-based investigations of sediment contamination. Results indicated no preference for either type, and depended, again, on the specific combination of species and substance. It is concluded that both artificial and natural sediments are very useful tools with advantages as well as inherent limitations. A parallel application should be considered in spiking-based assessments. The observed significant alterations of results induced by time concurrently indicated a need to developed research strategies to sustainably address time-dependence as potential confounding impact. Difference between exposures to single substances or mixtures was also identified as a relevant impact. Both identified influences might result in severe over- or underestimations of risks associated with contamination of sediments. However, acknowledgement of factors impacting results in environmental assessment creates a novel challenge. Assessing confounding impacts apparently calls for more tests, whereas economical and animal welfare considerations prioritise a minimisation of test demands. Hence, a three step, long-term strategy is proposed, which can eventually reduce necessity for extensive testing and address confounding impacts at the same time: a) Pilot-studies on the targeted confounding impacts (such as given in the present thesis), b) Integrative studies to assess the interlinking of the addressed impacts between different organisational levels and c) Inclusion of the confounding impacts into holistic, predictive models. In addition, the novel idea of adverse outcome pathways was identified as promising conceptual strategy to characterise and understand the mechanisms of confounding impacts. To realise such long-term research strategies on the organisational level, concentrated cooperational efforts in research frameworks are necessary. Current EU-founded projects such as MODELKEY provide examples how frameworks can be conceived that are developed to address the challenge posed by confounding impacts. The impact of time, in particular, was identified to be sufficiently severe to justify its inclusion into such frameworks...|$|R
40|$|Antibiotics and {{personal}} care products are used in large quantities and commonly detected in various environmental compartments. The two antibiotics, ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole, and the personal care product triclosan {{are among the most}} commonly detected compounds in sewage treatment plants and aquatic environments. Due to their usage patterns there is a risk that they also will end up in the coastal marine environment, where they risk affecting marine microorganisms. Despite this, {{only a limited number of}} studies have been published on their occurrence and ecotoxicity in the marine environment. As ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and triclosan are used for their inherent antimicrobial properties, microorganisms are thus likely to be among the most sensitive organisms and the aim of this thesis is thus to perform an in depth ecotoxicological hazard assessment on natural marine microbial communities. Periphyton (biofilm forming communities composed of both autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms) from the Gullmar fjord on the Swedish west coast was used for the hazard assessments. Chronic effects on the periphyton were assessed using two types of <b>test</b> systems, the <b>semi-static</b> SWIFT periphyton <b>test</b> and a flow through microcosm system. Clear concentration-dependent effects on bacterial respiration rates were observed on the periphytic bacteria after exposure to the two antibiotics, ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole. Triclosan never inhibited the bacterial part of the periphyton communities despite its use as an antimicrobial agent. Algae were on the other hand insensitive to the two antibiotics and no inhibition was observed for periphytic algae exposed to ciprofloxacin or sulfamethoxazole. Sulfamethoxazole did instead stimulate total pigment content already at the lowest test concentrations of 5 nmol/L. Triclosan did in contrast affect periphytic algae in a concentration-dependent fashion in all experiments. The triclosan experiments performed with the SWIFT periphyton test system consistently resulted in inhibition of algal pigment content while a significant increase of total and individual pigment content was seen in the flow-through microcosm experiment with triclosan. This increase was probably due to a shift in species composition, a so called toxicant induced succession, producing a community composed of species with higher triclosan tolerance. A significantly increased community tolerance (PICT) was indeed observed for communities pre-exposed to triclosan concentrations of 100 nmol/L in the microcosm system. PICT was measured and quantified using acute inhibition of photosynthesis as well as chronic inhibition of algal pigment content (in the SWIFT periphyton test). A tenfold increase in tolerance, compared to the unexposed control communities, was observed with both methods. The chronic SWIFT test, however, detected PICT at lower exposure levels than the acute test of photosynthesis inhibition. The results for the SWIFT test thus indicate that chronic methods can be used to assess PICT...|$|R
40|$|Cylindrospermopsin (CYN) is an {{alkaloid}} toxin {{produced by}} at least six bluegreen algal genera. In Australia, the most common producer organism is Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. This research determined the toxic effects and potential for toxin bioaccumulation associated with toxin-producing C. raciborskii, using environmentally relevant exposure scenarios. Short-term <b>semi-static</b> renewal ecotoxicity <b>tests</b> were conducted on four freshwater test organisms, using freeze-thawed C. raciborskii whole cell extracts or live cultures of C. raciborskii containing CYN. Duckweed (Spirodela oligorrhiza) demonstrated variable responses to whole cellextract exposures containing 0 â€“ 500 Î¼g L- 1 of CYN. Growth stimulation and growth inhibition were recorded from the duckweed, depending on toxin exposure concentrations and length of the incubation period. Chlorophyll content of Spirodela was also affected by toxin exposure, with small peaks in chlorophyll a recorded in conjunction with exposure to 8 Î¼g L- 1 CYN. Changes to frond morphology (chlorosis, necrosis) and reduced root lengths were also noted, but these effects were not consistent throughout all trials. Bioconcentration of free CYN was not detected in the tissues of Spirodela; small quantities of toxin recovered from the tissues probably represented toxin sorption to the cell walls. Growth of water thyme (Hydrilla verticillata) was stimulated by exposure to whole cell extracts of C. raciborskii containing a maximum of 400 Î¼g L- 1 CYN. Exposure to the test solutions appeared to promote the redistribution of plant resources in H. verticillata, and the possible benefits of this, {{particularly with respect to}} increased root production, were considered. Effects on the chlorophyll content of Hydrilla were variable and included decreases in total chlorophyll content and changes to the chlorophyll a:b ratio. Bioconcentration of free toxin was not detected in the tissues of Hydrilla. In trials with Melanoides tuberculata, exposure to whole cell extracts or live algal cultures did not significantly affect the behaviour or relative growth rates of adult snails. However, changes in the number of hatchlings released from parent snails were recorded: exposure to whole cell extracts corresponded with increased numbers of hatchlings compared with controls, whereas decreases in hatchling numbers compared with controls were recorded from treatments containing live C. raciborskii. Both bioconcentration and bioaccumulation occurred in the soft tissues of snails, although exposure to whole cell extracts resulted in only minor tissue contamination compared with that from live C. raciborskii exposures. Bioaccumulation of the analog deoxy-CYN was recorded in the soft tissues. M. tuberculata did not bioconcentrate CYN in the shell. Tadpoles of the cane toad (Bufo marinus) featured the most dramatic responses to the test solutions. Exposure to live C. raciborskii cultures resulted in up to 66 % mortality of B. marinus, whereas all tadpoles survived exposure to whole cell extracts of comparable CYN concentrations. Decreases in the time spent swimming and relative growth rates were recorded from surviving tadpoles during both types of exposure regimes. Histological examination of Bufo tissues revealed tissue injuries to multiple organs, with particular severity noted in the liver, intestine, nephric ducts and gill epithelia. The extent of cellular damage was similar in whole cell extract (containing a maximum of 400 Î¼g L- 1 CYN) and the live culture trials (containing a maximum of 232 Î¼g L- 1), despite the unequal toxin concentrations. Bioconcentration of CYN was not evident during the whole cell extract trial, whereas exposure to live cultures resulted in maximum average tissue concentrations of 895 Î¼g toxin kg- 1 fresh weight. A secondary aim of the thesis was to identify and address gaps in management approaches for toxin bioaccumulation and possible environmental effects associated with toxin-producing C. raciborskii blooms. A predictive management strategy was developed to determine the likelihood of tissue contamination in aquatic organisms inhabiting water bodies affected by blooms. The ten-step framework for predicting bioaccumulation risk was based upon characteristics of cyanotoxin bioavailability, exposure and uptake routes during the progression of a toxic bloom. Key concepts included monitoring changes in toxin availability throughout the progression of a toxic bloom, and the prediction of bioaccumulation risks based on threshold toxin values for selected aquatic organisms. These threshold values were re-examined following the completion of the laboratory trials. Current approaches for the management of blooms with respect to environmental risks were discussed, and procedures for the proper evaluation of environmental risks associated with Cylindrospermopsis blooms were assessed. These included adequate detection and monitoring systems, setting of environmental guideline values, and options for the control and remediation of toxic blooms...|$|R
