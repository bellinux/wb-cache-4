500|$|The {{show was}} {{originally}} entitled We Are Mongrels, but the title {{had to be}} changed for two reasons: one was that the title was too similar to another BBC Three comedy <b>show,</b> <b>We</b> Are Klang. The other {{is that none of}} the characters were mongrels. Therefore, new suggestions were called for. Rejected titles included I, Nelson; Humans! Everywhere!; Undergrowth and Never Been Stroked. The last of these titles was rejected after one of the show's additional writers, Danielle Ward; [...] "said it sounded like 'a makeover show for virgins'." [...] During this time the crew referred to the show as Mongrels and it eventually became the show's title.|$|E
500|$|Many years later, co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney recalled, [...] "To be frank, I {{was really}} surprised, {{because we thought}} we were {{creating}} the quintessential American <b>show.</b> <b>We</b> thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, and it turns out they're the most international characters ever created". Mike Dann, a former CBS executive whom Cooney had hired as a CTW vice-president and her assistant, was assigned to field offers from other countries to produce their own versions of Sesame Street. Dann's appointment led to television critic Marvin Kitman stating, [...] "After he [...] sells [...] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV".|$|E

[...] Mantle has said of his role: It is the job I've enjoyed doing {{more than anything else}} on TV. I have the greatest memories of beautiful, halcyon days-out filming on location and we had such a great, fun crew working on the <b>show.</b> <b>We</b> still get together once a year. Not just the cast but also the directors, producer, props guys, it's like a family! I think the key to part of the series' success was that this great camaraderie came across on screen.|$|E

A June headlining {{tour of the}} UK and Ireland was also confirmed, and almost immediately after the announcement, some venues sold out. [...] "Hard to Explain" [...] was named as the album's first single with a release date of June25 {{to coincide with the}} tour. At the time, Moretti stated, [...] "In Britain, people are much more responsive... I'm so psyched to be going back, every <b>show</b> <b>we</b> played people were enjoying it. There's {{a lot of people here}} in America who think we've had it too easy, but they have never really heard the music." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank Spotnitz {{said of the}} episode's origins, [...] "We've {{destroyed}} all {{the stuff}} about Mulder's father, the project, and the Syndicate. All the things that had sustained us for six years were suddenly gone. We had no crutches. From that point on, every time we sat down to write a mythology <b>show,</b> <b>we</b> {{knew it was going}} to be a completely different challenge." [...] Chris Carter saw the episode as a transitional episode, stating [...] "I felt that, with [...] "The Sixth Extinction", I was just playing a supporting role and that the episode, essentially the middle episode of a three-episode arc, was just a transitional episode to get us to '', which was really less about the mythology and more about Mulder's choices in life." ...|$|E

500|$|Co-creators and {{executive}} producers Damon Lindelof and J.J. Abrams wrote the premiere's teleplay {{based upon a}} story by Lindelof. The episode was Abrams' first Lost writing credit since the pilot. They laid out the third season {{with the idea of}} [...] "us versus them"; Carlton Cuse, a showrunner, explained, [...] "And who is us? And who is them? I mean I think we all tend to objectify people who we don't know much about and I think that's the audience's view of The Others right now -- they are bad, they are the malevolent force on the island. But {{over the course of the}} stories we're going to be telling this season on the <b>show</b> <b>we</b> expect the audience's view of The Others to change a lot." ...|$|E
500|$|On Burton's hiring, he and Logan {{reworked}} the screenplay; Logan {{felt they}} agreed over the film's tone due to [...] "share stunted childhoods watching Amicus movies". Turning a three-hour stage musical into a two-hour film required some changes. Some songs were shortened, {{while others were}} completely removed. Burton said [...] "In terms of the show, it was three hours long, but we weren't out to film the Broadway <b>show,</b> <b>we</b> were {{out to make a}} movie, so we tried to keep the pace like those old melodramas. Sondheim himself is not a real big fan of movie musicals, so he was really open to honing it down to a more pacey shape." [...] Burton and Logan also reduced the prominence of other secondary elements, such as the romance between Todd's daughter Johanna and Anthony, to allow them to focus on the triangular relationship between Todd, Mrs. Lovett, and Toby.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Povenmire and Marsh {{conceived}} the series Phineas and Ferb, {{based on their}} similar experiences of childhood summers spent outdoors. [...] Povenmire spent 14–16 years pitching Phineas and Ferb to several networks. Most rejected it as unfeasible for the complexity of its plots, but Povenmire persevered, later observing [...] "It was really the <b>show</b> <b>we</b> wanted to see: if this was on the air, I'd watch it, and I don't always feel that about every show I work on." [...] Even the Walt Disney Company initially rejected Povenmire's pitch, but asked to keep the proposal packet: [...] "Usually that means they {{throw it in the}} trash later," [...] Povenmire recalled. [...] Eventually Disney called Povenmire back with an acceptance, on the condition that he would produce an 11-minute pilot. He called Marsh, who was living in England, to ask him if he would like to work on the pilot; Marsh accepted immediately and moved back to the United States.|$|E

500|$|In December 2010, Jason Lipshutz of Billboard {{magazine}} {{reported that}} Los Tigres del Norte {{was set to}} record a MTV Unplugged album for MTV Tr3s. The album was to be taped {{in the first quarter}} of 2011, and would feature special guests including Juanes, Calle 13, Andrés Calamaro and Zack de la Rocha. By February 2011, it was announced that Paulina Rubio and Diego Torres would join the band for the album recording session. For the band this presented a unique opportunity to re-invent their music and share the stage with talented performers. [...] "When MTV invited us to record the <b>show,</b> <b>we</b> were a little tense, this was something different for us because Unplugged albums on MTV are usually recorded by artists from different genres from us," [...] the band said about the recording. Jesús Lara of MTV Tr3s called the production [...] "historic", since the band has been culturally a part of the life of the Hispanic community in Mexico and the US.|$|E
500|$|Kim Manners called [...] "Grotesque" [...] his {{favorite}} third-season episode and praised David Duchovny's performance on this episode, saying [...] "Duchovny drove himself, {{and he was}} brilliant in that show." [...] Manners also said of the episode: [...] "I think 'Grotesque' is a frightening show. I {{think it is a}} disturbing show, and I think that's why—for me—it's such a good <b>show.</b> <b>We</b> pulled it off making the viewer feel uneasy. I even found it a difficult show to watch. Yeah, it was a pretty dark hour of television and I would like to do more of those." [...] In order to get a proper feel for the episode, Manners listened to the music from the 1990 film Jacob's Ladder until his wife [...] "finally asked, 'Do we have to listen to that (bleeping) CD again?'" [...] Manners also theorized that the episode may have been the template for the show Millennium, which premiered on Fox the following television season.|$|E
500|$|NBC {{ordered a}} four-episode second season, {{which would be}} {{broadcast}} in January 1994 as a mid-year replacement. A decision about whether to renew the show for a [...] would then be made based on how those four episodes performed in the ratings. David P. Kalat, author of Homicide: Life on the Street [...] The Unofficial Companion, credited NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield with that move, although Levinson claimed NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer was behind the decision. Ohlmeyer said he believed a better timeslot, less dense stories and less hand-held photography would attract more viewers and help the show succeed better: [...] "For it to succeed long-term, there's a humanity {{that needs to be}} brought to the characters. There's more here than there was last year." [...] Littlefield said of Homicide, [...] "It's a <b>show</b> <b>we</b> think has tremendous potential that was not fully realized in the first nine episodes.
