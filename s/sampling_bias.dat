In earlier research, <b>sample</b> <b>bias</b> has been suggested to pose a sizeable threat to predictive performance and profitability due to its implications on either population drainage or biased estimates. Contrary to previous – mainly theoretical – research on <b>sample</b> <b>bias,</b> the unique features of the dataset {{used in this study}} provide the opportunity to investigate the issue in an empirical setting. Based on the data of a mail-order company offering short term consumer credit to their consumers, we show that (i) given a certain <b>sample</b> size, <b>sample</b> <b>bias</b> has a significant effect on consumer credit-scoring performance and profitability, (ii) its effect is composed of the inclusion of rejected orders in the scoring model, and the inclusion of these orders into the variable-selection process, and (iii) the impact of the effect of <b>sample</b> <b>bias</b> on consumer credit scoring performance and profitability is modest. consumer credit scoring; sample bias; reject inference. ...|$|R

The images show that the surface is composed of rows with spacing of 6. 07 Å. Two types of domains with their c-planes perpendicular are observed in which the domain boundary is oriented at ∼ 45 ◦ to the c-planes. In other cases, the angle between the c-planes of the two domains is closer to 87 ◦, consistent with a twin model {{in which the two}} domains meet along a (101) plane. Atomic resolution images vary with the <b>sample</b> <b>bias.</b> At lower <b>sample</b> <b>bias,</b> primarily Mn 1 atoms are observed. At higher <b>sample</b> <b>bias,</b> both Mn 1 and Mn 2 atoms can be resolved. The dependence of the atomic resolution image on <b>sample</b> <b>bias</b> is explained by the ratio of the integrated local density of states of Mn 1 to that of Mn 2, which are based on first-principles theory.

However, statistical analysis shows that this can only account for 50% of the observed pattern, and other evidence (such as fungal spikes) provides reassurance that most widely accepted extinction events are real.

25|$|Some {{studies suggest}} that {{reversals}} back to the ancestral free-living condition have occurred, but this evidence has been extensively challenged because: 1) the data exhibits taxa <b>sampling</b> <b>bias</b> and model dependency, 2) most non-mycorrhizal taxa lie within strongly AM clades, rather than EcM ones, and 3) the derived EcM condition is specialized, and would likely have given an ecological advantage that reversion to saprotrophy would not have. Furthermore, Hibbett and Matheny performed Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analyses yielding results that indicate that an ancestral EcM condition that was subsequently lost multiple times is simply not parsimonious. These reversals to a saprotrophic mode are impractical given that the host plants involved in the EcM symbioses (Pinaceae and rosids) had not yet evolved when the studied class Agaricomycetes first appeared.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, {{there was}} {{considerable}} interest {{in the role of}} chronic Otitis media (middle ear disease or 'glue ear') in causing APD and related language and literacy problems. Otitis media with effusion is a very common childhood disease that causes a fluctuating conductive hearing loss, and there was concern this may disrupt auditory development if it occurred during a sensitive period. Consistent with this, in a sample of young children with chronic ear infections recruited from a hospital otolargyngology department, increased rates of auditory difficulties were found later in childhood. However, this kind of study will suffer from <b>sampling</b> <b>bias</b> because children with otitis media {{will be more likely to}} be referred to hospital departments if they are experiencing developmental difficulties. Compared with hospital studies, epidemiological studies, which assesses a whole population for otitis media and then evaluate outcomes, have found much weaker evidence for long-term impacts of otitis media on language outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Studies of pedophilia {{in child}} sex {{offenders}} often report that it co-occurs with other psychopathologies, such as low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and personality problems. It {{is not clear}} whether these are features of the disorder itself, artifacts of <b>sampling</b> <b>bias,</b> or consequences of being identified as a sex offender. One review of the literature concluded that research on personality correlates and psychopathology in pedophiles is rarely methodologically correct, in part owing to confusion between pedophiles and child sex offenders, as well as the difficulty of obtaining a representative, community sample of pedophiles. Seto (2004) points out that pedophiles who are available from a clinical setting are likely there because of distress over their sexual preference or pressure from others. This increases the likelihood that they will show psychological problems. Similarly, pedophiles recruited from a correctional setting have been convicted of a crime, making it more likely that they will show anti-social characteristics.|$|E

25|$|However, it is {{not only}} prehistoric, pre-literate {{cultures}} that can be studied using archaeology but historic, literate cultures as well, through the sub-discipline of historical archaeology. For many literate cultures, such as Ancient Greece and Mesopotamia, their surviving records are often incomplete and biased to some extent. In many societies, literacy was restricted to the elite classes, such as the clergy or the bureaucracy of court or temple. The literacy even of aristocrats has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts. The interests and world-view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the populace. Writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into libraries and be preserved there for posterity. Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases, assumptions, cultural values and possibly deceptions of a limited range of individuals, usually {{a small fraction of the}} larger population. Hence, written records cannot be trusted as a sole source.
