50|$|On stage {{lighting}} instruments, {{a trunnion}} is a bracket attached to {{both ends of}} a <b>striplight</b> that allows the <b>striplight</b> to be mounted on the floor. Sometimes trunnions are also equipped with casters to allow the <b>striplight</b> to be moved easily.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, with Alex Mitchell (Curve) she {{formed a}} new band, 'Striplight'. With Mitchell on guitar, Liz Tumber on vocals and Mark Woodgate on drums, <b>Striplight</b> {{released}} two singles on Tim 'Love' Lee's label, Tummy Touch Records, {{and one on}} KOI Records.|$|E
50|$|A <b>striplight</b> is a {{multi-circuit}} stage lighting instrument. Striplights {{are one of}} {{the most}} basic types of lighting fixtures available. They usually consist of row of lamps. A single <b>striplight</b> is usually wired internally into either 3 or 4 circuits. Each internal circuit consists of several lamps evenly spaced within the unit. Often, a lighting designer will use roundels (colored glass lenses) or gels to make these lights different colors. The unit can then be wired into several different circuits, allowing each bank of colored lights to be controlled by a separate dimmer on the lighting board. Striplights are often used to color a cyclorama, or can alternately be positioned behind the proscenium arch to provide a general overhead color wash.|$|E
50|$|Often, {{in older}} and low budget venues such as churches and schools, <b>striplights</b> {{are the primary}} {{lighting}} source. Nowadays, LED <b>striplights</b> are becoming more common. These units can deliver a similar light output with reduced power consumption. They also {{eliminate the need for}} roundels or gels.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, it {{introduced}} a multiple PAR {{as an alternative}} to <b>striplights.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 2002, ETC {{introduced}} the Source Four MultiPAR {{as an alternative}} to <b>striplights.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Artcraft Fluorescent Lighting Corporation {{was one of}} the {{top three}} {{manufacturers}} of fluorescent lighting fixtures in the United States {{from the time of the}} public introduction of the fluorescent lamp at the 1939 World's Fair. Artcraft announced a slimline ballast and showcase <b>striplight</b> fixture in 1946.|$|E
50|$|Thompson {{subsequently}} joined {{members of}} Gaye Bykers on Acid and The Janitors {{in the band}} G.R.O.W.T.H.., who released the album For Lack Of Horses They Straddle Dogs. Mosquera reverted to a career in fine art. Corina joined The Mekons and, later, <b>Striplight</b> (with Alex Mitchell of Curve). She has also recorded with Bill Carter of Screaming Blue Messiahs.|$|E
50|$|Many theaters use scoop lights for worklights, rehearsals, {{non-performance}} times, {{and certain}} performance times. Scoops {{can be used}} to mimic the effect of a <b>striplight</b> to illuminate a cyclorama. They are easy to set up and take down, are relatively inexpensive, typically have long lamp life. When used as worklights, scoop lights frequently don't require the use of the light board to operate.|$|E
2500|$|LED stage {{lights come}} in four main types. PAR cans, spotlights, <b>striplights,</b> and [...] "moving head" [...] types. In LED PAR cans, a round {{printed circuit board}} with LEDs mounted on is used {{in place of a}} PAR lamp. Moving head types can either be a bank of LEDs mounted on a yoke or more {{conventional}} moving head lights with the bulb replaced with an LED bank.|$|R
25|$|Strip lights, {{also known}} as {{cyclorama}} or cyc lights (thus named because they are effective for lighting the cyclorama, a curtain {{at the back of}} the stage), border lights, and codas (by the brand name), are long housings typically containing multiple lamps arranged along the length of the instrument and emitting light perpendicular to its length. Lamps are often covered with gels of multiple colors (often red, green, and blue, which, in theory, allow almost any color to be mixed) with each color controlled by a separate electrical dimmer circuit. Many <b>striplights</b> use round pieces of glass (called roundels) rather than plastic gels for color. Roundels can sustain heavy use for a long time without fading and are often found in more permanent installations.|$|R
50|$|Border lights, {{also known}} as <b>striplights,</b> were a row of lights that hung {{horizontally}} in the flies. Color was added later by dying cotton, wool, and silk cloth. Lengths were constructed {{the same way as}} the border light, only these lights were mounted vertically in the rear where the wings were. Bunch lights are a cluster of burners that sat on a vertical base that was fueled directly from the gas line. The conical reflector can be related to Fresnels that are currently used today. This adjustable box of light reflected a beam in which the size could be altered by a barndoor. Limelight spots are similar to todayâ€™s current spotlighting system. This instrument was used in scene shops, as well as the stage.|$|R

5000|$|After its use as {{a family}} home, it was sold to the 'West Riding County Council' in 1957 and was {{transformed}} into a nursing home before it was then sold on to a firm of architects. The architects neglected the building by converting it into offices. In the mid 1990s, the architects downsized and the current owner, Andrew Cusack, moved his computing business in on part of the ground floor of the hall. A year later, the opportunity arose for Cusack to purchase the hall. After acknowledging its tragic neglect, he did so. He quotes [...] "It was in a poor state, it was all lit by <b>striplights</b> and the magnificent fireplaces were all still boxed in. I did quite a lot of renovations which, in truth, increased the price to myself when I bought the freehold for the whole of the property two years ago." ...|$|R
5000|$|As Rama {{approaches}} perihelion, the biots {{jump into}} the cylindrical sea, where they are destroyed (or recycled) by aquatic biots ('sharks') and reabsorbed into the mineral-laden water. On their final expedition, some crew members decide to visit the city christened [...] "London" [...] (as it is closest to Rama's [...] "northern" [...] end, the point of their entry), where they use a laser to cut open one of the [...] "buildings" [...] {{to see what it}} houses. They discover transparent pedestals containing holograms of various artefacts, which they theorise are used by the Ramans as templates for creating tools and other objects. The most amazing of these appears to be a uniform with bandoliers, straps and pockets that suggests {{the size and shape of}} the Ramans. As the crew photographs some of the holograms, the six gigantic <b>striplights</b> that illuminate Rama's interior start to dim, prompting the explorers to leave and re-board Endeavour.|$|R
5000|$|A Dreamachine is [...] "viewed" [...] {{with the}} eyes closed: the {{pulsating}} light stimulates the optic nerve and thus alters the brain's electrical oscillations. Users experience increasingly bright, complex patterns of color behind their closed eyelids (a similar effect may be experienced when travelling as a passenger in a car or bus; close your eyes as the vehicle passes through flickering shadows cast by roadside trees, or under a close-set line of streetlights or tunnel <b>striplights).</b> The patterns become shapes and symbols, swirling around, until the user feels surrounded by colors. It is claimed that by using a Dreamachine one may enter a hypnagogic state. [...] This experience may sometimes be quite intense, but to escape from it, one needs only to open one's eyes.The Dreamachine may be dangerous for persons with photosensitive epilepsy or other nervous disorders. It is thought {{that one out of}} 10,000 adults will experience a seizure while viewing the device; about twice as many children will have a similar ill effect.|$|R
