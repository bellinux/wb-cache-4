40|$|Abstract—Recently, much {{progress}} has been made on achieving information-flow security via <b>secure</b> multi-execution. <b>Secure</b> multi-execution (SME) is an elegant way to enforce security by executing a given program multiple times, once for each security level, while carefully dispatching inputs and ensuring that an execution at a given level is responsible for producing outputs for information sinks at that level. <b>Secure</b> multiexecution guarantees noninterference, in the sense of no dependencies from secret inputs to public outputs, and transparency, in the sense that if a program is <b>secure</b> then its <b>secure</b> multiexecution does not destroy its original behavior. This paper pushes the boundary of what can be achieved with <b>secure</b> multi-execution. First, we lift the assumption from the original <b>secure</b> multi-execution work on the totality of the input environment (that there is always assumed to be input) and on the cooperative scheduling. Second, we generalize <b>secure</b> multi-execution to distinguish between security levels of presence and content of messages. Third, we introduce a declassification model for <b>secure</b> multi-execution that allows expressing what information can be released. Fourth, we establish a full transparency result showing how <b>secure</b> multiexecution can preserve the original order of messages in <b>secure</b> programs. We demonstrate that full transparency is a key enabler for discovering attacks with <b>secure</b> multi-execution. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Secure</b> Tropos, an {{extension}} of the Tropos methodology, considers security requirements alongside functional requirements, from {{the early stages of the}} system development process. The <b>Secure</b> Tropos language uses security concepts such as security constraint, <b>secure</b> goal, <b>secure</b> plan, <b>secure</b> resource, and threat to capture the security concepts from both social and organisational settings. These concepts are used to model and reason about security for a specific system context. This paper presents a CASE tool, called SecTro, which supports automated modelling and analysis of security requirements based on <b>Secure</b> Tropos. The tool’s architecture, layout, and functionalities are demonstrated through a real world example using the <b>Secure</b> Tropos concepts...|$|R
