40|$|To {{understand}} {{the etiology of}} <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> disorder (SAD) heterogeneous biological, psychological and environmental mechanisms needs to be considered. The aim of our study was to review theoretical hypotheses and therapeutic possibilities for <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> disorder, which focus on alterations of circadian rhythms and monoaminergic neurotransmitter function {{as well as the}} role of vitamin D 3 and possible implications of the cognitive-behavioral model. These discrepant hypotheses are insufficient alone to interpret the pathophysiology of SAD, but the integrative dual vulnerability hypothesis is an option to explain emergence of <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> disorder. In addition to summarizing theoretical approaches we also review and evaluate the therapeutic possibilities derive form these hypotheses. In practice the most effective treatment for SAD is the combination of light therapy, antidepressants and psychotherapy.

If not accurately diagnosed, certain treatments could only worsen the previous condition.

40|$|AbstractBright light {{therapy has}} been shown to have a {{positive}} impact on <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> disorder (SAD), <b>depression</b> and anxiety. Smell has also {{has been shown}} to have effects on mood, stress, anxiety and depression. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the combination of light and smell in a non-adaptive cycle. Human subjects were given smell (lemon, lavender or peppermint) and light stimuli in a triangular wave (60 scycle) for 15 min. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored before and after each session for 5 consecutive days and a Profile of Mood States (POMS) test was administered before and after the sensory stimulation on days 1, 3 and 5. The light-smell stimulus lowered blood pressure, both systolic and diastolic, and reduced heart rate for all odours compared to control. Of the two sensory stimuli, the odour stimulus contributed most to this effect. The different aromas in the light-smell combinations could be distinguished by their different effects on the mood factors with lemon inducing the greatest mood changes in Dejection-Depression, Anger-Hostility, Tension-Anxiety. In conclusion, combined light and smell stimulation was effective in lowering blood pressure, reducing heart rate and improving mood. The combination was more effective than either smell or light stimuli alone, suggesting that a light-smell combination would be a more robust and efficacious alternative treatment for depression, anxiety and stress...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} {{chronobiology}} has vastly expanded {{over the past}} few decades, bringing together research from the fields of circadian rhythms and sleep. The importance of the environmental day–night cycle on our health is becoming increasingly evident as we evolve into a 24 -hour society. Reducing or changing sleep times against our natural instincts to rest at night has a detrimental impact on our well-being. The mammalian circadian clock, termed "the suprachiasmatic nucleus", is responsible for synchronizing our behavioral and physiological outputs to the environment. It utilizes light transcoded by specialized retinal photoreceptors as its cue to set internal rhythms to be in phase with the light–dark cycle. Misalignment of these outputs results in symptoms such as altered/disturbed sleep patterns, changes in mood, and physical and mental exhaustion – symptoms shared by many affective clinical disorders. Key links to circadian abnormalities have been found in a number of disorders, such as <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> disorder, nonseasonal <b>depression,</b> and bipolar <b>affective</b> disorder. Furthermore, therapies developed through chronobiological research {{have been shown to be}} beneficial in the treatment of these conditions. In this article, we discuss the impact of circadian research on the management of affective disorders, giving evidence of how a misaligned circadian system may be a contributor to the symptoms of depression and how moderating circadian rhythms with light therapy benefits patients...|$|R
40|$|Sleep problems, {{especially}} nightmares and insomnia, often accompany depression. This {{study investigated}} how nightmares, symptoms of insomnia, chronotype and sleep duration associate with <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> disorder, a special form of depression. Additionally, {{it was noted}} how latitude, a proxy for photoperiod, and characteristics of the place of residence affect the prevalence of <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> disorder and sleep problems. To study these questions, data from FINRISK 2012 study were used.

The Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire was used to assess symptoms of <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> disorder. Participants with symptoms of <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> disorder had significantly increased odds of experiencing frequent nightmares and symptoms of insomnia, and they were more often evening chronotypes. Associations between latitude, population size and urbanicity with <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> disorder symptoms and sleep disturbances were generally not significant, although participants living in areas bordering urban centres had less sleep problems than participants from other regions.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} weather or <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> disorder and the financial market, using {{a wide variety of}} financial market data as well as several weather variables and a <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> disorder proxy. We distinguish between a model with a direct effect of the weather and <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> disorder on the financial market and one with an indirect effect via a latent variable mood. Whereas only the latter model is justified by psychological literature, the former model is often used as an approximation. One major innovation of this paper is a consistent econometric implementation of the indirect effects model. We demonstrate that the approximation by direct effects yields inconsistent estimates. Our study supports some weather related, but no <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> disorder related effects on the financial market. We show that, instead of focusing on single market segments, an analysis of various financial market segments is required. We also show that the analysis of individual stock returns or bond spreads reveals additional information, compared to the analysis of aggregate stock or bond indexes. (author's abstract...|$|R
40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that certain abnormalities (e. g., in phase or amplitude) of the circadian pacemaker underlie <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> disorder, Methods: One male <b>seasonal</b> <b>affective</b> disorder patient (blind to the study: design) participated in two 120 -hour forced desynchrony experiments and tvas subjected to six 20 -hour days, once during a depressive episode and once after recovery. Core body temperature was continuously measured. During wakefulness, the Adjective Mood Scale was completed at 2 -hour intervals, Results: Sleep-wake as well as pacemaker-related variations of mood were found, both when the subject was depressed and when he was euthymic. Compared with recovery, during the depressive episode the circadian temperature minimum and the circadian mood variation showed phase delays of approximately 1 and 2 hours, respectively.
