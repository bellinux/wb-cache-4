50|$|In 1964 an AN/FPS-27 <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> was {{installed}} and in 1965 the AN/FPS-66 was relocated to Burns AFS, OR, {{to replace the}} AN/FPS-7B <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> there.|$|R
50|$|The cruisers' {{ultimate}} radar suite {{included one}} 'Big Net' or 'Top Trough' air <b>search</b> <b>radar,</b> one 'High Sieve' or 'Low Sieve' air <b>search</b> <b>radar,</b> one 'Knife Rest' air <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> and one 'Slim Net' air <b>search</b> <b>radar.</b> For navigational radar {{they had one}} 'Don-2' or 'Neptune' model. For fire control purposes the ships were equipped with two 'Sun Visor' radars, two 'Top Bow' 152 mm gun radars and eight 'Egg Cup' gun radars. For electronic countermeasures the ships were equipped with two 'Watch Dog' ECM systems.|$|R
50|$|<b>Search</b> <b>radars</b> scan a {{wide area}} with pulses of short radio waves. They usually scan the area {{two to four}} times a minute. Sometimes <b>search</b> <b>radars</b> use the Doppler effect to {{separate}} moving vehicles from clutter. Targeting radars use the same principle as <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> but scan a much smaller area far more often, usually several times a second or more. Weather <b>radars</b> resemble <b>search</b> <b>radars,</b> but use radio waves with circular polarization and a wavelength to reflect from water droplets. Some weather radar use the Doppler effect to measure wind speeds.|$|R
50|$|Ramore {{contained}} an AN/FPS-3 <b>search</b> <b>radar,</b> AB/TPS-502 Height finder radar and an AN/FPS-502 Back-Up <b>Search</b> <b>radar.</b> The back-up radar could function as either <b>search</b> or height <b>radar.</b> The operating radius was approximately 180 miles which stretched as far west as Hearst {{and as far}} north as Moosonee.|$|R
50|$|Gray {{carried the}} AN/SLQ-32 Electronic Warfare Suite. For anti-submarine work, she carried AN/SQS-26 Sonar and the AN/SQR-18 Towed array sonars. The ship also carried the AN/SPS-40 Air <b>Search</b> <b>Radar</b> and the AN/SPS-67 Surface <b>Search</b> <b>Radar.</b>|$|R
50|$|The LPD is {{equipped}} with a Type 360 (Seagull-S) air / surface <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> operating on E / F-band frequencies, a Type 364 G-band air <b>search</b> <b>radar,</b> a Type 344 I-band fire control radar and a navigation radar.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, {{near the}} end of the ships' careers, the radar suite {{consisted}} of a Hughes SPS-52C air <b>search</b> <b>radar,</b> a Lockheed SPS-40C air <b>search</b> <b>radar,</b> a Norden SPS-67V surface <b>search</b> <b>radar,</b> two Raytheon SPG-51G fire control radars for the Mark 13 launcher, and a Western Electric SPG-53F fire control radar for the 5-inch guns. A Sangamo SQS-23KL hull-mounted sonar was fitted in the bow. Countermeasures included two SRBOC Mark 36 units, a Nulka decoy launcher, and an SQL-25 towed decoy.|$|R

50|$|Basis {{equipment}} of {{the unit}} includes <b>search</b> <b>radar,</b> {{the only one of}} its particular type in the Bangor Sector; an unmanned <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> at Topsfield, Maine, 90 miles northeast of the squadron site; a height finding radar complex; a digital data transmitted and data-link transmitter.|$|R
50|$|The Air Force {{upgraded}} the <b>search</b> <b>radar,</b> {{first to}} an AN/FPS-20A, {{and then to}} an AN/FPS-66. By 1963 this AN/FPS-66 <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> operated in conjunction with AN/FPS-6 and AN/FPS-90 height-finder radars, and on 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-74.|$|R

50|$|In 1955 an AN/FPS-8 <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> {{was placed}} on the site, and {{subsequently}} converted to and redesignated as an AN/GPS-3. In 1958 the 759th AC&W Sq began operating an AN/FPS-20 <b>search</b> <b>radar,</b> as well as AN/FPS-6 and AN/FPS-6A height-finder radars. In 1962 the AN/FPS-20 was upgraded to become an AN/FPS-67 radar.|$|R
5000|$|The Westinghouse-(now Northrop-Grumman)-ARSR-4 built 3-D air {{surveillance}} radar in the 1990s for the JSS. By the late 1990s, this radar had replaced {{most of the}} 1960s-vintage AN/FPS-20 variant <b>search</b> <b>radars</b> {{and a number of}} ARSR-3 <b>search</b> <b>radars</b> under a project termed the [...] "FAA/Air Force Radar Replacement" [...] (FARR) program.|$|R

50|$|The air <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> is a Fregat-MAE-5 (NATO {{reporting}} name: ‘Top Plate’) 3D air <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> {{mounted at}} the top of the rear mast, offering two channels in E-band. The radar can track up to 40 targets simultaneously, and has a maximum range of 120km to aircraft and 50km to sea-skimming missile.|$|R
5000|$|With a {{semi-active}} radar homing system, {{the launch}} platform acquires the target with its <b>search</b> <b>radar.</b> The missile is then powered up while the launch platform's illuminator radar [...] "lights up" [...] the target for it. The illuminator is a radar transmitter with a narrow, focused beam {{that may be}} separate from the <b>search</b> <b>radar</b> {{and that can be}} directed at a target using information from the <b>search</b> <b>radar.</b> When the passive radar of the missile's guidance system is able to [...] "see"/detect the radio waves reflected from the target, missile lock-on is achieved and the weapon is ready to be launched.|$|R
