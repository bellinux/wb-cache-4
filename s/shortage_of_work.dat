5|$|The {{third phase}} of the {{resettlement}} involved the dispersal of the new arrivals from the temporary villages in regions surrounding the capital and other large cities. The areas where the refugees had initially were over settled, notably Biên Hòa, where the population had doubled during the migration period. In contrast, two thirds of South Vietnamese provinces had taken less than 10,000 refugees, {{and some of these}} less than 1,000. In the crowded provinces there were fears of social unrest due to a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
25|$|The union lost {{roughly half}} of its members in the early 1930s. While {{the passage of the}} Davis–Bacon Act {{required}} payment of the prevailing wage on federal construction projects, the desperate <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> allowed some employers to force their employees to pay kickbacks to them to hold on to their jobs. A number of union members hopped freight cars to go in search for work. At the same time the union's old enemy, the Carpenters union, resumed its jurisdictional war with it.|$|E
25|$|The {{second major}} flaw arose because a large {{proportion}} of the land in the new colony was bought for speculative reasons by people who had no intention of migrating to New Zealand and developing the land they had bought. This meant that the new colonies had a serious shortage of employers and consequently a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> for the labouring classes. From the outset the New Zealand Company was forced to be the major employer in the new colonies and this proved a serious financial drain on the company. Repeated approaches were made to the British government seeking financial assistance and in late 1846 the company accepted an offer for a £236,000 advance with strict conditions on, and oversight of, future company operations.|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} industry in Botswana {{has in the}} recent years come under severe pressure due to increased competition and a critical <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> construction <b>work.</b> The competition has been {{as a result of a}} dramatic influx of foreign firms that have set up base in Botswana in recent years due to Botswana’s good economic performance. The abundant diamond resources coupled with the government’s sound macroeconomic policies have largely driven this economic growth. As a result <b>of</b> the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> construction <b>work,</b> locally owned emerging construction companies have had to change their bidding strategies in order to be competitive and secure construction work. This in turn has led these companies tendering at very low prices and sometimes submitting sub-economic bids. In doing so, these construction companies do not price for all the risks they are expected to carry if their bids mature into a construction contract. This paper investigates the sources of risk due to the client (Botswana local authorities) and due to statutory requirements and whether these sources are perceived by the emerging building contractors to have an influence in their (contractors) pricing strategies. The paper also investigates the risk management strategies, which are employed by these contractors in order to minimize risks during competitive tendering. The study concentrated on those building projects tendered in the public sector within the local authorities in Botswana. This was further narrowed down to specifically those projects tendered for the district councils located in the southern region of Botswana. The study concentrated on building projects and excluded civil engineering projects and projects that are overwhelmingly of specialized electrical or mechanical installations.

50|$|There is no {{credible}} {{information available}} on illegal immigration in Canada. Estimates range between 35,000 and 120,000 {{illegal immigrants in}} Canada. James Bissett, a {{former head of the}} Canadian Immigration Service, has suggested that the lack of any credible refugee screening process, combined with a high likelihood of ignoring any deportation orders, has resulted in tens of thousands of outstanding warrants for the arrest of rejected refugee claimants, with little attempt at enforcement. Refugee claimants in Canada do not have to attempt re-entry to learn the status of their claim. A 2008 report by the Auditor General Sheila Fraser stated that Canada has lost track of as many as 41,000 illegal immigrants. This number was predicted to increase drastically with the expiration of temporary employer work permits issued in 2007 and 2008, which were not renewed in many cases because of the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> due to the recession.|$|E
5000|$|The Committee soon {{organised}} two venues {{for regular}} distribution of alms: the White Raven tavern in Mile End and the Yorkshire Stingo, in Lisson Grove, Marylebone. These venues were open {{for several hours}} a day providing outdoor relief. There was also a sick house set up in Warren Street, where 40-50 men needing medical attention were provided for with indoor relief. Some of the recipients of aid were found jobs, particularly as seamen. In providing clothes so that men could get work as sailors, some of the committee members were simply applying the same charitable methods they had used in organisations such as the Marine Society. But, the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> at sea meant that unemployment remained a problem. Surplus labour was drifting in from the countryside, and many English people also took up begging in London. Lacking the resources to set up any new industry, the Committee took heed of such individuals as Richard Weaver who was [...] "willing and desirous to go to Halifax and other Parts of Nova Scotia {{where there is a}} fairer Prospect of Employment" [...] (see Black Nova Scotians). Soon the charity focused its goals on giving [...] "a temporary relief to the objects of the Charity, and in future to provide them with clothes and a settlement abroad" [...] [...] [...] [...] "to such places as may put them in a condition of getting their bread in freedom and comfort".|$|E
40|$|First paragraph: The {{history of}} {{literature}} and art offers no <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> created to offend or shock an audience, but few have been as incendiary as gangsta rap. Apologists cannot deny the problematic content of this form of rap—the misogynistic posturing, themes of intense violence, freewheeling and gratuitous obscenity—and some detractors hold that even the attempt to analyze the genre bestows undeserved legitimacy on its practitioners. The transgressive and counter-hegemonic stance of gangsta rap has become so hreatening, in fact, that its origins as a complex poetic form with deep roots {{in a variety of}} literary and ritual traditions have, for the most part, been neglected or obscured. Indeed, it is difficult to think of any poetic form in the contemporary West in which politics, race and ideology have dictated so completely the terms of 2 ̆ 2 acceptable 2 ̆ 2 criticism. This is all the more remarkable for gangsta rap, insofar as so much foundational scholarship, some even decades old, already exists within fields such as folklore, psychology and anthropology which can articulate the nexus of literary and cultural forces that gave rise to it. As such approaches make clear, far from being an unprecedented art form that can only reflect the social pathologies idiosyncratic to American ghetto life, gangsta rap operates within a well-documented poetic tradition within African-American culture that ritualizes invective, satire, obscenity, and other verbal phenomena with transgressive aims...|$|R

50|$|This is {{significant}} because feminist discourses are critical and liberatory in intent and are not thereby exempt from inscription in their internal power relations. The hope of postcolonial feminists is that the wider feminist movement will incorporate these vast arrays of theories which are aimed at reaching a cultural perspective beyond the Western world by acknowledging the individual experiences of women around the world. Ali Suki highlights the lack of representation of women of color in feminist scholarship comparing the weight of whiteness similar to the weight of masculinities. This issue is not due to a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> scholarly <b>work</b> in the global South but a lack of recognition and circulation. This reinforces Western hegemony and supports the claim of outweighed representation of white, Western scholars. Most available feminist literature regarding the global South tends to be written by Western theorists resulting in the whitewashing of histories.|$|R
