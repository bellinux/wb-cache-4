2500|$|At Cranley Gardens, Nilsen had {{no access}} to a garden, and as he resided in an attic flat, {{he was unable to}} stow any bodies beneath his floorboards. For almost two months, any acquaintances Nilsen {{encountered}} and lured to his flat were not assaulted in any manner, although he attempted to strangle a 19-year-old student named Paul Nobbs on 23 November 1981. In March 1982, Nilsen encountered a 23-year-old named John Howlett as he (Nilsen) drank in a pub located close to Leicester Square. Howlett was lured to Nilsen's flat on the promise of continuing drinking with Nilsen. At Cranley Gardens, both Nilsen and Howlett drank as they watched a film, before Howlett walked into Nilsen's front room and fell asleep in the bed (which was located in the front room at this time). One hour later, Nilsen unsuccessfully attempted to rouse Howlett, then <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the bed drinking rum as he stared at Howlett, before deciding to kill him. Following a ferocious struggle (in which Howlett himself attempted to strangle his attacker), Nilsen strangled Howlett into unconsciousness with an upholstery strap before returning to his living room, shaking from the [...] "stress of the struggle" [...] in which he had believed he would be overpowered. On three occasions over the following ten minutes, Nilsen unsuccessfully attempted to kill this victim after noting he had resumed breathing, before deciding to fill his bathtub with water and drown him.|$|E
2500|$|The {{construction}} of the superstructure commenced on 1 April 1994. Interiors with furniture were completed on 1 January 1996, the spires of Tower 1 and Tower 2 were completed on 1 March 1996, and the first batch of Petronas personnel moved into the building on 1 January 1997. The building was officially opened by the Prime Minister of Malaysia's Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad on 1 August 1999. The twin towers were built {{on the site of}} Kuala Lumpur's race track. Test boreholes found that the original construction site effectively <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of a cliff. One half of the site was decayed limestone while the other half was soft rock. The entire site was moved [...] to allow the buildings to sit entirely on the soft rock. Because of the depth of the bedrock, the buildings were built on the world's deepest foundations. 104 concrete piles, ranging from [...] deep, were bored into the ground. The concrete raft foundation, comprising [...] of concrete was continuously poured through a period of 54 hours for each tower. The raft is [...] thick, weighs [...] and held the world record for the largest concrete pour until 2007. The foundations were completed within 12 months by Bachy Soletanche and required massive amounts of concrete. The Petronas Towers' structural system is a tube in tube design, invented by Fazlur Rahman Khan. Applying a tube-structure for extreme tall buildings is a common phenomenon.|$|E
