40|$|Gene pools become {{subdivided}} {{because of}} many different reasons, but it is generally quite difficult to pinpoint the main factors contributing to that process. In each generation, individual phenotypes are confronted with changing environments and their fitness is assessed. If the bet to some variant proves correct, the prize can be a magnificent adaptive radiation; if wrong, extinction is the maximum penalty, because some choices may become irreversible. Systems formed by host plants and phytophagous insects are, a priori, very good candidates {{for this kind of}} studies. In this communication we explore the phylogeographic relationships between populations of the <b>Spanish</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>moth</b> Graellsia isabellae and those of different Pinus spp. hosts. G. isabellae is a montane species whose larvae feed either on P. sylvestris, P. nigra or P. halepensis, depending on the population. Attending to morphological characteristics, the species is subdivided into five subspecies, associated to different mountain systems. Our results indicate that the mitochondrial genomes of these subspecies are indeed differentiated, that the time of coalescence of many of the identified mutations precedes the LGM, and that none of the Pinus hosts offers a phylogeographic pattern completely concordant with the relationships observed among them...|$|E

50|$|Argema mimosae (African <b>moon</b> <b>moth)</b> {{is a giant}} {{silk moth}} of the Family Saturniidae. Similar in {{appearance}} to the giant Madagascan <b>moon</b> <b>moth</b> (Argema mittrei), but smaller, this moth can be found widely in Eastern Africa and more locally in Southern Africa, including near {{the east coast of}} South Africa. An adult can measure 10 to 12 cm across its wingspan and 12 to 14 cm from head to the tip of its elongated 'tail-like' second pair of wings. Its forward wings have a distinctive grey-coloured 'furry' leading edge, giving a very rough surface, presumably for aerodynamic reasons. Apart from the eye-like markings on its wings, the colouring and shape of the wings give the appearance of a piece of foliage, especially the 'tail-like' structures of the rearmost wings which resemble a dried out leaf stem - presumably for camouflage in its natural environment.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spanish</b> <b>Moon</b> (foaled April 24, 2004) is an American-bred and British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse, {{owned by}} Khalid Abdullah. He became famous for running {{second in the}} Dubai Sheema Classic. His one group one win came in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud.|$|R

5000|$|At Royal Ascot on 19 June {{the colt}} was ridden by Tom Queally {{when he was}} stepped up in {{distance}} and started a 25/1 outsider for the Hardwicke Stakes over {{one and a half}} miles. He never looked likely to win but kept on well in the closing stages to finish fourth behind Harbinger despite having some problems obtaining clear run in the straight. Nineteen days after his run at Ascot Sans Frontieres, with Queally again in the saddle, started at odds of 14/1 in an eight-runner field for the Princess of Wales's Stakes on good to firm ground at Newmarket. <b>Spanish</b> <b>Moon</b> started favourite while the other runners included Crowded House, Holberg (winner of the Queen's Vase), Tazeez (Earl of Sefton Stakes) and Man of Iron. After being restrained by Queally in the early stages he moved up to take the lead approaching the final furlong and stayed on well to win by two and a half lengths from the Barry Hills-trained Redwood, with another two and a half lengths back to Tazeez in third place. After the race Jeremy Noseda said [...] "I came here thinking he'd finish in the three but I didn't think he'd beat <b>Spanish</b> <b>Moon.</b> But if <b>Spanish</b> <b>Moon</b> didn't perform, he'd have as good a chance as anything. I didn't expect to win, so hadn't looked much beyond today, but hopefully there will be a better day ahead".|$|R
50|$|Eventually, Thissell {{solves the}} mystery by {{borrowing}} a slave {{from each of}} the suspects and determining their masters' mask preferences before and after Angmark's arrival. He succeeds in identifying his quarry, but is captured and forced to walk unmasked in public (the ultimate humiliation to the natives), while Angmark masquerades as Thissell by wearing his <b>Moon</b> <b>Moth</b> mask. However, the Sirenese turn on Angmark and kill him for the perversion of unmasking another man and, ironically, for Thissell's previous gaffes.|$|R
5|$|Several {{species of}} Lepidoptera utilise {{the leaves of}} {{ailanthus}} as food, including the Indian <b>moon</b> <b>moth</b> (Actias selene) and the common grass yellow (Eurema hecabe). In North America the tree is the host plant for the ailanthus webworm (Atteva aurea), though this ermine moth is native to Central and South America and originally used {{other members of the}} mostly tropical Simaroubaceae as its hosts. In its native range A. altissima is associated with at least 32 species of arthropods and 13 species of fungi.|$|R
5000|$|Edwer Thissell, the new consul from Earth to {{the planet}} Sirene, has trouble {{adjusting}} to the local culture. The Sirenese cover their faces and heads with exquisitely crafted masks that indicate their social status (strakh) and mood. They also communicate by singing, accompanying themselves with one of a score of musical instruments, selected based on the social situation and feelings. Furthermore, errors of etiquette may prove fatal. Thissell is a clumsy musician and lacks confidence in the alien society, so he is forced to wear a lowly <b>Moon</b> <b>Moth</b> mask.|$|R
25|$|Another way {{in which}} Vance expands the usually narrow focus of most Speculative Fiction (SF) writers are the {{extensive}} details ranging from the culture of language, to food, and music. In the story entitled The <b>Moon</b> <b>Moth,</b> for example, natives must master a number of musical instruments in order {{to communicate with each}} other -spoken words are modulated to acquire different meanings, or may be said to be given full meaning, (respect, derision or sarcasm) by means of the musical sounds. These fascinating details paint a far more detailed and complex picture of life in his books.|$|R
50|$|The {{comet moth}} (Argema mittrei) or Madagascan <b>moon</b> <b>moth</b> is an African moth, {{native to the}} rain forests of Madagascar. The male has a {{wingspan}} of twenty centimeters and a tail span of fifteen centimeters, {{making it one of}} the world's largest silk moths. The female lays from 120-170 eggs, and after hatching the larvae feed on Eugenia and Weinmannia leaves for approximately two months before pupating. The cocoon has numerous holes to keep the pupa from drowning in the daily rains of its natural habitat. The adult moth cannot feed and only lives for 4 to 5 days. Although endangered in the wild due to habitat loss, the Comet moth is being successfully bred in captivity.|$|R
50|$|Harbisson has collaborated {{extensively}} with <b>Spanish</b> choreographer <b>Moon</b> Ribas in {{a series}} of devised theatre and dance performances such as Opus No.1, premiered at London's BAC Theatre, The Sound of the Orange Tree, premiered at Barcelona's Antic Teatre and Walking Colours.|$|R
50|$|Hong Kong has a rich insect fauna. At least 6,784 {{species has}} been {{recorded}} so far and 700 additional species {{are expected to be}} found. There are about 240 butterfly species, including the beautiful Swallowtails and Birdwings (Troides helena and Troides aeacus). Of over 2,000 moth species recorded, the Atlas moth (Attacus atlas) is outstanding for its large size with wing span up to 30 centimetres, while the Chinese <b>Moon</b> <b>Moth</b> (Actias ningpoana) is eye-catching for its long hindwing tails. Endemic moth species include Athetis hongkongensis, Ugia purpurea, Athetis bispurca and Egira ambigua. The dragonfly fauna is diverse, with over 110 species recorded, some of which are endemic to Hong Kong. Hong Kong also has 235 species of ants, 17 species of praying mantids, 31 species of cockroaches, 6 species of flea, 78 species of mosquitoes and 124 species of grasshoppers. 4,583 species are known to be plant eating (phytophagous) and over 1,000 species are beneficial insects either preying on or existing as parasites over other pests.|$|R

50|$|Unraced at two, Daryakana did {{not appear}} on the racecourse until July 2009 when she won the Prix Blangy Pont over 2400m at Clarefontaine. A month later she was moved up in {{distance}} and won the Prix de Troarn over 2800m at Deauville. In September Daryakana ran in her first Conditions race and took the Listed Prix Tourelles at Chantilly. At the Arc meeting at Longchamp in October Daryakana contested her first Group race and maintained her unbeaten record by winning the Prix de Royallieu from Peinture Rare and Plumania. On her final {{start of the season}} Daryakana was sent to Sha Tin Racecourse for the Hong Kong Vase, where her opponents included Youmzain, Viva Pataca, Jaguar Mail, Kasbah Bliss and Cirrus des Aigles. Ridden by Gerald Mosse, the filly was restrained in last place in the early stages before making her challenge on the outside in the straight. She reached the front in the last strides to win by a short head from <b>Spanish</b> <b>Moon.</b>|$|R
60|$|On {{the east}} side three strong battalions of the enemy {{attacked}} the outwork across the Geule, known as the <b>Spanish</b> Half <b>Moon.</b> Vere, who was everywhere supervising the defence, ordered the weak garrison there to withdraw, and sent a soldier out to give himself up, and {{to tell them that}} the Half Moon was slenderly manned, and to offer to lead them in. The offer was accepted, and the Spaniards took possession of the work.|$|R
