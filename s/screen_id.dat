Aim: This nationwide multicentre study in Finland evaluated the incidence and risk factors of ID in previously untreated patients (PUPs) with severe haemophilia A (FVIII:C < 0. 01 IU mL− 1). Methods: We enrolled all PUPs (N = 62) born between June 1994 and May 2013 with at least 75 exposure days (EDs) to <b>screen</b> <b>ID</b> during follow-up extending to September 2013. Results: Thirteen ID (21 % of 62) occurred; 10 (16 % of 62) with high titre. Fifty-one patients (82 %) were on primary prophylaxis (regular prophylaxis {{before the age of}} 2 and before the first joint bleed) from the median age of 11. 4 months, 90 % via a central venous access device. The initial product was rFVIII in 63 % and pd-FVIII in 37 %, moreover in 24 % pd-FVIII was switched to rFVIII concentrate during the 75 EDs. Non-transient inhibitors developed in 9 / 51 (17. 6 %; 13. 7 % high titre) children with primary and in 4 / 11 (36. 4 %; 27. 3 % high titre) patients with secondary prophylaxis (P = 0. 24). Overall, 74 % had a high-risk genotype similarly distributed among the prophylaxis groups. The history of a major bleed enhanced ID (aHR, 4. 0; 95 % CI, 1. 2 – 13. 7), whereas FVIII treatment intensity or source and early implantation of ports did not increase ID risk. Conclusion: The cumulative incidence of ID was low notwithstanding prevalent high-risk mutations. Despite patient-related risk factors, our management involving early intensive primary prophylaxis via ports helps to prevent bleeds and lower the incidence of inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} an online Taiwanese {{community}} named the Spiteful Tots. The long-term participants are mainly gay men, with several lesbian women, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) and heterosexual people. The community, whilst accessible by anyone via a registered <b>screen</b> <b>ID</b> name, operates like a private club. As {{a part of}} this community from its beginning in 2000, I am interested in the community in this particular location, not least because of my own affiliation with Taiwan, but because of the cultural specificity of Taiwan as non-Western and yet Westernised. My research methodology is based on approaches inspired by ethnography. I observe the dynamics, participate in the community, collect data, and visit online and offline sites to formulate ideas in relation to both the inside and outside of the community. I use knowledge and experience gained from my interaction with the Spiteful Tots participants and with the wider Taiwanese society. I locate the community within the culture of contemporary Taiwan, utilising and critiquing previous literature on the politics of sexuality, gender theories, and critical analyses of heteronormativity. My findings are: a) the Spiteful Tots participants carefully negotiate ways of maintaining privacy within the group, and do not ‘come out’ in recognised LGBT ways; b) the Spiteful Tots community focuses on discussion of mundane everyday life, rather than on sexual politics. My findings have the following implications: a) privacy and everydayness enables the Spiteful Tots participants to assert 'freedom from scrutiny and created a zone of "relative insularity"' (Cohen 2000); b) a rejection to heteronormativity is enabled by (re) asserting the right of privacy and validating everyday life as a gay or queer subject, and c) therefore, there needs to be consideration and recognition of gay or queer subjects’ right of privacy, as well as academic and political attention to the representation of sexual minorities’ everydayness...|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{diagnosis}} of Equine Influenza (EI) {{is critical to}} the implementation of control measures. In this study, two rapid antigen detection (RAD) kits and three ELISA kits were evaluated as diagnostic aids in the detection of EI. The Directigen Flu A, Espline Influenza A&B-N and the <b>ID</b> <b>Screen</b> Influenza A Antigen Capture ELISA were compared to the traditional ‘gold standard’ diagnostic tests, virus isolation (VI) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A total of 75 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from horses on premises where natural outbreaks had occurred, and a total of 104 swabs were collected from experimentally challenged foals and tested by all five methods. RT-PCR was the most sensitive diagnostic technique. Directigen Flu A was the most sensitive kit in both sample groups detecting 46. 95 % positive in comparison to 16. 18 % (Espline Influenza A&B-N) and 16. 96 % (<b>ID</b> <b>Screen</b> Influenza A Antigen Capture ELISA). The superiority of Directigen Flu A was confirmed by comparing the limit of sensitivity of the three assays using known concentrations of virus. Post challenge, Directigen Flu A detected positives at the time of peak virus shedding but was less effective when horses were excreting low levels of virus. Thus Directigen Flu A test is a useful screening technique but negative samples from suspect cases should be submitted to a laboratory for testing by RT-PCR. The <b>ID</b> <b>Screen</b> Influenza A Antibody Competition ELISA which detects antibodies against the viral nucleoprotein (NP) was compared to the single radial haemolysis (SRH) test and the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. Paired samples from 203 horses on 14 infected premises were tested. Fewer seroconversions were detected by <b>ID</b> <b>Screen</b> Influenza A Antibody Competition ELISA (25 %) than by SRH (43 %) or HI (41 %). The acute samples from the majority of affected horses that were not detected by <b>ID</b> <b>Screen</b> Influenza A Antibody Competition ELISA were seropositive. Post challenge in seronegative foals, the <b>ID</b> <b>Screen</b> Influenza A Antibody Competition ELISA detected a rise in antibodies earlier than the SRH test suggesting that in naїve populations this ELISA could provide a faster diagnosis than traditional serology methods. Sera collected from 60 weanlings following primary vaccination with five different vaccines (two whole inactivated vaccines, two ISCOM based subunit vaccines and a canary pox recombinant vaccine) were tested by <b>ID</b> <b>Screen</b> Influenza A Antibody Competition ELISA and SRH. The ELISA did not detect the antibody response to vaccination with the canary pox recombinant vaccine (Proteq Flu Te), confirming the usefulness of the combination of this kit and vaccine to differentiate between naturally infected and vaccinated horses i. e. DIVA. The pattern of antibody response post vaccination detected with the <b>ID</b> <b>Screen</b> Influenza A Antibody Competition ELISA was similar to that detected by the SRH test for the other four vaccines. The antibody response to the other two subunit vaccines (Equip FT and Equilis Prequenza Te) was detected by <b>ID</b> <b>Screen</b> Influenza A Antibody Competition ELISA i. e. no DIVA capacity was evident. An <b>ID</b> <b>Screen</b> Influenza H 7 Antibody Competition ELISA was also evaluated and demonstrated potential for measuring vaccinal response to H 7 N 7 virus. In summary {{the results of this study}} suggest that sensitive RADs and ELISAs may be useful supplementary tests in the diagnosis and management of EI and in the monitoring of vaccine performance...|$|R
40|$|Hemoglobin (Hb), mean {{cell volume}} (MCV), and {{erythrocyte}} protoporphyrin (EP) are commonly used to screen for iron deficiency (ID), but systematic evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of these tests is limited. The objective {{of this study is}} to determine the sensitivity and specificity of Hb, MCV, and EP measurements in <b>screening</b> for <b>ID</b> in preschool children, non-pregnant women 15 – 49 years of age, and pregnant women. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) (NHANES 2003 – 2006 : n = 861, children three to five years of age; n = 3112, non-pregnant women 15 to 49 years of age. NHANES 1999 – 2006 : n = 1150, pregnant women) were examined for this purpose. Children or women with blood lead ≥ 10 µg/dL or C-reactive protein (CRP) > 5. 0 mg/L were excluded. ID was defined as total body iron stores < 0 mg/kg body weight, calculated from the ratio of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) to serum ferritin (SF). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to characterize the sensitivity and specificity of Hb, MCV, and EP measurements in <b>screening</b> for <b>ID.</b> In detecting ID in children three to five years of age, EP (Area under the Curve (AUC) 0. 80) was superior to Hb (AUC 0. 62) (p < 0. 01) but not statistically different from MCV (AUC 0. 73). In women, EP and Hb were comparable (non-pregnant AUC 0. 86 and 0. 84, respectively; pregnant 0. 77 and 0. 74, respectively), and both were better than MCV (non-pregnant AUC 0. 80; pregnant 0. 70) (p < 0. 01). We concluded that the sensitivity and specificity of EP in <b>screening</b> for <b>ID</b> were consistently superior to or at least as effective as those of Hb and MCV in each population examined. For children three to five years of age, EP <b>screening</b> for <b>ID</b> was significantly better than Hb and similar to MCV.

40|$|Background People with {{intellectual}} disability (ID) {{in the general}} population and people in prison experience unrecognised medical conditions and inadequate disease prevention. Among prisoners, those with an ID may be particularly disadvantaged. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify demographic, health and health-related characteristics of adult prisoners who <b>screened</b> positive for <b>ID.</b> Methods Cross-sectional data were collected via face-to-face administration of a structured questionnaire in seven prisons in Queensland, Australia, between 2008 and 2010. Participants were adult prisoners within 6 weeks of release from custody. We identified ID using a pragmatic screening tool. Prisoners who scored < 85 on the Hayes Ability Screening Index and either (a) reported having attended a special school or (b) reported having been diagnosed with an ID were considered to have <b>screened</b> positive for <b>ID.</b> We compared the characteristics of participants who screened positive and negative for ID using univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Results <b>Screening</b> positive for <b>ID</b> was associated with younger age, identifying as Indigenous and lower educational achievement. Prisoners who <b>screened</b> positive for <b>ID</b> were more likely to have been diagnosed with medical conditions such as heart disease (odds ratio; 95 % confidence interval?=? 2. 1; 1. 0 - 4. 2) and hearing problems (2. 2; 1. 3 - 3. 7), after adjustment for age, sex, education level and Indigenous status. Screen-positive prisoners were less likely to have received preventive care interventions such as testing for hepatitis A infection (0. 4; 0. 2 - 0. 6), and immunisation for tuberculosis (0. 4; 0. 2 - 0. 8). Prisoners with possible ID were more likely to be obese (1. 7; 1. 1 - 2. 7). Conclusions Adult prisoners who <b>screen</b> positive for <b>ID</b> have worse health outcomes than their non-disabled peers. An improved understanding of physical health characteristics prior to release can direct treatment and support pathways out of the criminal justice system and inform transitional planning of health services for this profoundly disadvantaged group.

40|$|Carrier Sense Multiple Access / ID Countdown (CSMA/IC) is a collision-free ad hoc MAC protocol. CSMA/IC avoids {{simultaneous}} medium {{access by}} competing {{with a local}} unique ID assigned to each node. However, assigning the local unique ID to each node is a very complicated problem. In this paper, we propose a simple distributed ID assignment scheme for CSMA/IC.

Due to this “ID screen effect”, every node can estimate the largest ID among its contenders. Using this knowledge, we propose a self unique ID assignment scheme which does not require message exchanges. To complement our ID assignment scheme, we also suggest a “well arranged rotation ID system”. The proposed ID assignment scheme suffers from an ID increasing problem and an unfair medium access problem. However, the new ID system mitigates these problems in a very simple way. Simulation results show the proposed scheme operates quite efficiently and provides medium access opportunities fairly. 1...|$|R

40|$|Background: Intellectual {{disability}} (ID) is a {{major public}} health problem because the defect, treatment and rehabilitation require long life both medical and socio-economic assessment. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) {{is the most common}} cause of inherited X-linked intellectual disabilities (ID) with reduced penetrance. With regards to behavioral and emotional phenotype, FXS commonly mixed up with idiopathic autism. The prevalence is found higher in males compared to females. In accordance with rapid development of diagnosis technique, the prevalence of FXS is defining worldwide including Indonesia using, currently, simple molecular method. Objectives: This study was aimed to diagnose genetic cause of ID and to establish the prevalence of FXS among ID population in Central Java, and Yogyakarta Province. Method: Screening has been performed since 1994 continuously in high risk population (special school with and without autism) using clinical, cytogenetic, and FMR 1 gene PCR-based molecular approach. Cascade testing was subjected to the family members with positive result of FXS and many new cases were disclosed in our cohort study. Results: The prevalence of FXS among ID population was calculated to be 1. 9 % (5 / 262) in 1994 and 1. 7 % (9 / 527) in 2011. Among autism population it was determined to be 6. 15 % (4 / 65).

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of iron deficiency (ID) among non-pregnant, reproductive-age US women significantly exceeds rates among males. In clinical practice <b>ID</b> <b>screening</b> relies on hemoglobin, a late-stage indicator of ID. As a single, low-cost laboratory test to diagnose ID before anemia develops is lacking, the study {{objective was to}} improve <b>ID</b> <b>screening</b> by identifying risk factors among non-anemic, iron-deficient reproductive age women. Cross-sectional data were from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003 - 2010. Hemoglobin identified non-anemic women. ID was defined using the body iron formula, requiring ferritin and transferrin receptor values. Logistic regression assessed the association of sociodemographic, behavioral, and reproductive risk factors in an anemia-based conceptual framework with non-anemic reproductive age women (12 - 49 years) with ID, as well as subsets of younger (12 - 21 years) and older (22 - 49 years) women, recognizing that risks may differ by age. Among 6216 women, 494 had ID (prevalence was 8. 0 %, 95 % CI 7. 3 %, 8. 6 %). Among non-anemic younger women, 250 (8. 7 %, 95 % CI 7. 7 %, 9. 8 %) had ID, compared to 244 (7. 3 %, 95 % CI 6. 4 %, 8. 2 %) older women. Among younger women, menstruation for over 3 years was the only variable significantly associated with non-anemic ID (risk ratio 3. 18, 95 % CI 2. 03, 4. 96). No other significant risk factors were identified. Menstrual years was the only risk factor significantly associated with ID among non-anemic younger women. The negative results suggest ID risk factors among non-anemic women {{may need to be}} considered separately from those associated with ID anemia...|$|R
40|$|People with {{intellectual}} disabilities (ID) may {{be somewhat}} overrepresented {{in parts of the}} Criminal Justice System (CJS), but they are mostly not overrepresented in prisons in most Western countries. People with ID in the CJS are mostly male, from deprived social backgrounds, have mild or moderate (not severe) disabilities and often have mental health needs. They commit a range of offences (not disproportionate numbers of arson and sexual offences, as used to be thought) and typically have a number of well-recognised vulnerabilities in the CJS, including not understanding the process or their rights, being suggestible and acquiescent on interview and making unwise decisions at crucial points in the CJS. They are vulnerable to making false confessions, sometimes with fatal consequences. Protections for people with ID in the CJS do exist but often are insufficiently employed. <b>Screening</b> for <b>ID</b> is beginning to be used in some countries {{in some parts of the}} CJS and needs to be far more widespread, so that services can be provided where appropriate, including support to ensure their rights are upheld, services to help prevent reoffending and direct treatment. There are increasing numbers of reports of successful treatments available and the development of some specialist risk assessment tools for this population...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The Dutch Custodial Institutions Agency has {{commissioned}} {{a number of}} research projects on offenders with intellectual disabilities (ID) in prison. A continuing problem has been {{that it is not}} known what the prevalence of ID in Dutch prisons is, and how to identify ID in individual detainees. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – With this in mind a screening instrument (screener for learning disabilities and intelligence (SCIL)) has been developed that screens for IQ < 85. This instrument has been piloted in four different penitentiary institutes. Findings – The papers briefly describes the results of the studies preceding the pilot before turning to the pilot itself. The pilot shed light on what considerations need {{to be taken into account}} when implement <b>screening</b> for <b>ID</b> in the current prison system, and on the potential added value for prison staff of knowing whether a detainee possibly has an ID. In addition, the pilot gave some insight into the characteristics of Dutch prisoners. Originality/value – The main conclusion is that the SCIL can be successfully implemented within these settings, provided that sufficient attention is being paid to the advance instructions to staff and to the introduction of the screening to the detainees...|$|R
40|$|Background. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) {{considerably}} influences {{blood pressure}} regulation through water and sodium homoeostasis. Several {{of the studies}} have utilized anonymous genetic polymorphic markers and made inconsequent claims about the ANP relevant disorders. Thus, we <b>screened</b> Insertion/Deletion (<b>ID)</b> and G 191 A polymorphisms of ANP to discover sequence variations with potential functional significance and to specify the linkage disequilibrium pattern between polymorphisms. The relationships of detected polymorphisms with EH with or without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T 2 DM) status were tested subsequently. Method. ANP gene polymorphisms (I/D and A 191 G) were specified utilizing mutagenically separated Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in 320 subjects including 163 EH case subjects and 157 controls. Result. This case-control study discovered a significant association between I/D polymorphisms of ANP gene in EH patient without T 2 DM. However, the study determined no association between G 191 A polymorphisms of ANP in EH with or without T 2 DM. In addition, sociodemographic factors {{in the case and}} healthy subjects exhibited strong differences (P< 0. 05). Conclusion. As a risk factor, ANP gene polymorphisms may affect hypertension. Despite the small sample size in this study, it is the first research assessing the ANP gene polymorphisms in both EH and T 2 DM patients among Malaysian population...|$|R

40|$|Aim:To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of signs and symptoms related to TMJ disorders {{in a group of}} young people with aintelectual disability (ID) and a matched group of healthy adolescents. Methods: A number of 105 young Special Olympics (SO) athletes (ID group) aged from 14 to 25 years in the <b>screening.</b> The <b>ID</b> group and control group were examined for {{the presence or absence of}} signs and symptoms of TMD through interview and clinical examination. Results: A total of 64 young people with ID (61 %) had at least one sign of TMD compared to 41 (39 %) of the individuals screened was free of any TMD symptoms. A significantly higher prevalence of TMJ sound (palpation and stethoscope), TMJ tenderness, maximum vertical opening, headaches were observed among SO athletes compared to the healthy control group (p< 0. 05). A significant difference was recorded only for the Temporalis tenderness between the girls and boys (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: TMJ disorders are noticeable problem for intellectually disabled patients and a possible cause of pain that should be examined more in detail. We suggest that oral screening in people with a mental disability should be modified by including basic TMJ examination parameters in order to allow better understanding of the pathological aspects so as to address effective preventive and therapeutic measure...|$|R
