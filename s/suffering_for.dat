The costs include those that are economic, such as research, equipment purchases, and labour expenditures, as well as moral concerns over the welfare of the horses. As a result, more effective and efficient means of control have been called for.|$|E

5|$|The Italian theologian Francesco Antonio Zaccaria criticised Augustine's {{concept of}} {{evil in the}} eighteenth century. He noted a {{distinction}} between using the term evil to imply blame (sin) and to imply lament (suffering) and argued that Augustine posited sin to have occurred before suffering. This was problematic for Zaccaria, who believed that it made Augustine seem offhand and uninterested in human <b>suffering.</b> <b>For</b> Zaccaria, Augustine's perception of evil as a privation did not satisfactorily answer the questions of modern society as to why suffering exists.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from the war, Davey worked for the South Australian Railways as a labourer and linesman over three periods between 1926 and 1946. He married Eugene Agnes Tomlinson on 25 August 1928, there being no children of the union. After <b>suffering</b> <b>for</b> many years with bronchitis and emphysema, he died on 21 December 1953 of a coronary occlusion. He was buried at the West Terrace AIF Cemetery, Adelaide, with full military honours. In addition to the Victoria Cross, Military Medal, 1914–15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal for his service in World War I, Davey was also later awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal.

5|$|Washington {{went into}} {{quarters}} at Morristown {{during the winter}} of 1779–1780, which represented the worst <b>suffering</b> <b>for</b> the army during the war. The temperatures fell to 16 below zero, the New York Harbor was frozen over, and snow and ice covered the ground for weeks, with the troops again lacking provisions for a time as at Valley Forge. In late 1779, Clinton moved his forces south to Charleston for an offensive against the patriots led by Benjamin Lincoln. After his success there, Clinton returned victorious to New York, leaving Cornwallis in the south. Congress replaced Lincoln with Gates, despite Washington's recommendation of Greene. Gates failed in South Carolina and was then replaced by Greene. The British at the time seemed to have the South almost in their grasp. Despite this news, Washington was encouraged to learn in mid-1780 that Lafayette had returned from France with additional naval assets and forces.|$|E

25|$|Augustine teaches {{substitutionary}} atonement. However, {{the specific}} interpretation differed {{as to what}} this <b>suffering</b> <b>for</b> sinners meant. The early Church Fathers, including Athanasius and Augustine, taught that through Christ's suffering in humanity's place, he overcame and liberated us from death and the devil. Thus while the idea of substitutionary atonement is present in nearly all atonement theories, the specific idea of satisfaction and penal substitution are later developments in the Latin church.|$|E

25|$|Mahayana Buddhist schools {{de-emphasize}} {{the traditional}} view (still practiced in Theravada) {{of the release}} from individual Suffering (Dukkha) and attainment of Awakening (Nirvana).

The fundamental principles of Mahayana doctrine are based on the possibility of universal liberation from <b>suffering</b> <b>for</b> all beings, and the existence of the transcendent Buddha-nature, which is the eternal Buddha essence present, but hidden and unrecognised, in all living beings.|$|E

25|$|Cruelty to animals, {{also called}} animal abuse, animal neglect or simply animal cruelty, is the infliction by {{omission}} (animal neglect) or by commission by humans of suffering or harm upon any non-human animal, {{regardless of whether}} the act is against the law. More narrowly, it can be the causing of harm or <b>suffering</b> <b>for</b> specific achievement, such as killing animals for food or for their fur; opinions differ about the extent of cruelty associated with a given method of slaughter. Cruelty to animals sometimes encompasses inflicting harm or suffering as an end in itself, defined as zoosadism.|$|E
25|$|This psycho-physical {{process is}} further linked with {{psychological}} craving, manas (conceit) and ditthi (dogmas, views). One {{of the most}} problematic views according to the Buddha, {{is the notion of}} a permanent and solid Self or 'pure ego'. This is because in early Buddhist psychology, there is no fixed self (atta; Sanskrit atman) but the delusion of self and clinging to a self concept affects all one's behaviors and leads to <b>suffering.</b> <b>For</b> the Buddha, there is nothing uniform or substantial about a person, only a constantly changing stream of events or processes categorized under five categories called skandhas (heaps, aggregates), which includes the stream of consciousness (Vijñāna-sotam). False belief and attachment to an abiding ego-entity {{is at the root of}} most negative emotions.|$|E
25|$|Other {{writers have}} viewed Ben-Hur {{within the context}} of Wallace's own life. Historian Victor Davis Hanson argues that the novel drew from Wallace's {{experiences}} as a division commander during the American Civil War under General Ulysses S. Grant. Hanson compares Wallace's real-life experience in battle, battle tactics, combat leadership, and jealousies among American Civil War military commanders to those of Wallace's fictional character of Judah, whose unintentional injury to a high-ranking military commander leads to further tragedy and <b>suffering</b> <b>for</b> the Ben-Hur family. Wallace made some controversial command decisions, and he delayed in arriving on the battlefield during {{the first day of the}} battle of Shiloh, when Grant's Union army sustained heavy casualties. This created a furore in the North, damaged Wallace's military reputation, and drew accusations of incompetence.|$|E
