50|$|The wing may be {{a single}} or double <b>skin</b> <b>unit.</b> A single skin wing uses the same {{material}} for structure and holding the air, while a double skin arrangement uses an airtight bladder in a structural casing of strong but porous textile. Single skin construction is simpler, and usually uses RF welding to make the seams. These bladders are usually lighter and dry out more quickly than double skin wings, but if the bladder is punctured, a new bladder is relatively easily fitted to a double skin wing, while repair of the single skin bladder may not be practicable, depending on material and construction details. Single skin wings are also easier to decontaminate, particularly if the outer surface is smooth.Single skin wings may use a bellows fold gusset to increase inflatable volume while retaining a relatively compact outline. This can reduce drag while swimming when the bladder is deflated.|$|E
40|$|The {{cutaneous}} reaction {{demonstrates that}} the culture lysate of Streptococcus scarlatinæ is approximately ten time more potent in its toxic effect than is the culture filtrate since repeated and carefully controlled human skin tests show that 0. 1 cc. of a 1 : 2000 dilution of lysate reacts equally {{as well as a}} similar dose of a 1 : 250 dilution of culture filtrate (Dick's standard <b>skin</b> <b>unit).</b> Animal tests and the human intradermal reaction clearly reveal that the toxic principle of culture filtrate (Dick's toxin) and culture lysate (Duval-Hibbard endotoxin) are of the same nature) namely intracellular derivatives of the streptococcal cell. The in vivo prepared lysate affords a more potent antigen for the production of an antiendotoxic serum than the living, killed or culture filtrate of Streptococcus scarlatinæ. The inoculations into dogs of culture filtrate and of the "washed coccal bodies" yield strikingly different results. In those that receive filtrate no toxic effect is produced while in the ones injected with the washed coccal bodies a severe and often fatal toxemia results. The dog is highly susceptible to infection with Streptococcus scarlatinæ and also readily affected by injections of the in vivo prepared lysate. Toxic effects are produced almost immediately following the intravenous injection of lysate and death usually occurs in 24 to 48 hours from an acute hemorrhagic nephritis. Daily urinary examination shows a high percentage of albumin, large numbers of fine granular casts and quantities of macroscopic blood. A study of the kidney sections reveals an extensive glomerulonephritis. The work reported constitutes further evidence in support of our original contention that the poisonous substance of the scarlatinal streptococcus is derived from the bacterial cell set free through the dissolution of the germ plasm. The liberation of the poison in vitro occurs as the natural result of autolysis while in vivo it is produced through specific action of bacteriolysin...|$|E

Several chemotherapeutic regimens have been applied, either as monochemotherapy or as polychemotherapy, overall not resulting in an improvement of progression-free or overall survival.

Although this rate was lower than other published rates for IAD (20 %), 2 the clinicians felt it was important to reduce the rate of IAD.

40|$|When a fixed area of {{the ears}} of rabbits is {{subjected}} to the action of a standard destructive dose of x-rays (30 <b>skin</b> <b>units)</b> the type of reaction resulting depends upon the previous treatment of the rabbit. (1) In normal rabbits a mild acute inflammation develops in the x-rayed area which leads at once to a perforating gangrene within an average of 15 days. (2) If rabbits are x-rayed and about 2 weeks later injected with horse serum for the first time, a mild acute inflammation appears which heals for a time; then a second, subacute inflammation sets in {{which leads to a}} perforating gangrene. The average time of the process from the first inflammation to gangrene is 32 days. (3) If rabbits are sensitized with horse serum and 10 days later are exposed locally to the standard dose of x-rays, the ensuing ear reaction is either similar to the second reaction described above, except that it may last up to 110 days, or the first inflammation leads to a healing which may be apparently permanent (340 + days). (4) If rabbits are first sensitized with horse serum, exposed locally to the standard dose of x-rays 10 days later, and 13 days after the x-ray treatment reinjected with horse serum, the reaction of the x-rayed {{area of the}} ears is in general similar to the second reaction described above (inflammation—healing—inflammation—gangrene). The average time of the whole process is about 42 days. On the basis of the general hypothesis that an anaphylactic reaction is initiated in the body when the specific antibody meets its antigen, and that both antibody and antigen are rendered more or less functionally inert by their interaction, the following inferences may be drawn from our experimental results. (1) The protection from the effects of a standard destructive dose of x-rays which a previous sensitization confers, is referable to the presence of anaphylactic antibodies in the x-rayed area. (2) This protection is largely due to the anaphylactic antibodies which are anchored in the x-rayed area, and not to those which are free in the circulation. (3) An anaphylactic reaction renders the anchored anaphylactic antibodies largely impotent as protective factors against the standard destructive x-ray dose, even though sensitization preceded exposure to the x-rays. (4) An area treated with the standard destructive dose of x-rays is unable to produce or to anchor a sufficient amount of anaphylactic antibodies for protection from necrosis, when the x-ray treatment precedes the sensitization, or when the locally anchored anaphylactic antibodies are rendered functionally inactive by a general anaphylactic reaction. It is possible that the procedure of increasing the resistance of the skin to a destructive dose of x-rays by means of a previous sensitization with protein may be applicable in the treatment of certain types of inoperable disease, when it is important to use massive doses of x-rays. Animals which have been sensitized, or sensitized and reinjected with any undenatured alien protein, should not be reemployed as normal controls in any investigation unless trial has shown that these proteinized animals react quantitatively and qualitatively like normal animals.

In a linear static load case the 3 D model reached the lowest mass without any lattice structures by pure shell thickness optimization. A new method for the calculation of the mechanical loads induced by the SLM process yielded no meaningful results...|$|R
5000|$|Following Breguet's {{success in}} the 1954 and 1956 World Gliding Championships with the Type 901, Jean Cayla {{designed}} the Type 905 for the 1958 event. It is a Standard Class sailplane with a 15 m (49 ft 3in) span. Like its predecessor, the 905 is a cantilever mid-wing monoplane but the its structure contains glass reinforced plastic, more plastic foam and less fabric. It also has a butterfly tail. It has a wing of straight tapered planform, terminated with small [...] "salmon" [...] fairings at the squared-off wingtips. The major structural component is the main spar plus nose D-box <b>unit,</b> <b>skinned</b> with a plastic foam-filled ("Klegecel") sandwich with 0.6 mm (0.024 in)-ply outer layers. Ribs, ailerons and Schempp-Hirth airbrakes are attached to this torsion box. The whole upper wing surface and outboard lower surface is ply, supported by an internal Klegecell lining, with fabric below, aft of the spar. Slotted ailerons occupy the outer 45% of the trailing edge; there are no flaps. Each complete wing weighs just 34 kg (75 lb).|$|R
