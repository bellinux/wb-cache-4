5|$|Kimmie Meissner began {{figure skating}} at age six after {{watching}} her older brothers playing ice hockey. She landed her first triple, a <b>salchow</b> jump, six years later.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, figure skating was lent a more athletic character through the developments of Ulrich <b>Salchow,</b> a Swede. <b>Salchow</b> was considered the greatest figure skater of his day by far, winning the world championships ten times. The crowning achievement of his career, however, was his development of ice skates with slightly serrated blades, giving enough traction on the ice to launch long jumps. The <b>salchow</b> jump, still used prominently in figure skating routines today, is named for him, and was considered Salchow's greatest contribution to figure skating.|$|E
25|$|Asada did {{not include}} <b>salchow</b> jumps in her junior and senior career {{programs}} until 2008. She had stated previously that the triple <b>salchow</b> was the first triple jump she had ever landed and {{that she did not}} have a problem landing it cleanly, but she was not comfortable using the jump in competition because it is one of her least favorite jumps. Asada added the 3S to her free skating at the 2008 NHK Trophy and 2008–09 Grand Prix Final.|$|E
50|$|Double <b>Salchows</b> {{were first}} {{performed}} by Gillis Grafström {{for men in}} the 1920s, and Cecilia Colledge {{for women in the}} late 1930s.|$|R
5000|$|Ulrich <b>Salchow's</b> surname was {{pronounced}} [...] (anglicized to [...] ), {{but the name}} of the jump in English is invariably pronounced as [...] in North America and [...] in Europe.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Salchows,</b> {{which take}} off from either {{the left or right}} back inside edge. Allowing the edge to come round, the {{opposite}} leg helps launch the jump into the air and land on one foot; ...|$|R
25|$|Following this, at the NHK Trophy, Hanyu scored 103.89 in {{the short}} program after landing the quadruple Salchow-triple toe combination, triple Axel and a quadruple loop, albeit with a step out. The Olympic {{champion}} led by almost 16 points over Nathan Chen. In his free skating to “Hope and Legacy” by Joe Hisaishi, Hanyu nailed three quadruple jumps: loop, <b>Salchow</b> and a toe loop and only missed the second quad <b>Salchow.</b> He broke the three-hundred barrier again, with 301.47 for first place.|$|E
25|$|At the 2016 World Championships, Hanyu skated another clean short program, scoring 110.56 points. He {{won that}} {{segment of the}} {{competition}} and had a 12.04-point lead over second place Javier Fernández. On the free skating, Hanyu put a hand down on a quadruple <b>Salchow,</b> fell on a second one (and got deductions for missing the combination), he had a step out on a triple Axel, popped a triple <b>Salchow</b> into a double, and had another hand down on the triple Lutz. He got a score of 184.61, and was surpassed by Fernández with a clean free skating and a score of 216.41.|$|E
25|$|At the 2016–17 Grand Prix Final in Marseille, Hanyu placed {{first in}} the short program with the score of 106.53 points. He landed a nearly clean quadruple loop, nailed a quadruple Salchow-triple toe loop {{combination}} and triple Axel. On the free skating, Hanyu started strong with clean quadruple loop, followed by an equally flawless quadruple <b>Salchow,</b> but then fell on the second quadruple <b>Salchow</b> attempt, had an unsecure landing on a quadruple toe loop, and popped his final triple Lutz into a single. He was only third in the free skating, but his advantage after the short program allowed him to win his fourth straight Grand Prix title.|$|E
50|$|Javier Fernández (ESP) {{becomes the}} second European skater to land three quads (two <b>salchows</b> and a toe-loop) {{in a free}} program {{and the first one}} to do it with a quad-triple {{combination}} (4S+3T) at the 2012 Grand Prix Final in Sochi, Russia.|$|R
50|$|Theresa Weld {{caused a}} minor {{controversy}} by performing jumps such as <b>salchows</b> and loops, {{the only woman}} in the event to do any jumps beyond modest hops. She was told that such jumps were not considered suitable for a lady's program and that some judges marked down as a result.|$|R
50|$|When Arakawa was 5 years old, {{she became}} {{interested}} in skating and entered the Chibikko Skate School. She started ballet lessons at 7. While still 7, Arakawa began training with former Olympian Hiroshi Nagakubo, a pair skater who competed in the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan. She was landing triple <b>salchows</b> at age 8.|$|R
25|$|At the 2017 Four Continents Championships, Hanyu placed {{third in}} the short program with a score of 97.04 points. He popped his quadruple Salchow-triple toe loop {{combination}} to a double Salchow-triple toe loop combination. Despite this, the Olympic champion was only 6 points behind Nathan Chen (in first) and less than 3.5 points behind Shoma Uno (in second). During his free skating, he started strong with a quadruple loop and a quadruple <b>Salchow,</b> followed by a triple flip, but then popped his second quadruple Salchow-triple toe loop combination attempt to a double <b>Salchow.</b> To {{make up for lost}} points, Hanyu, in place of the planned triple Axel-double toe loop combination, performed a triple Axel-triple toe loop combination and also substituted the triple Axel-half loop-triple <b>Salchow</b> combination with a quadruple toe loop-double toe loop combination. The reigning Olympic champion also changed his final jumping pass from a triple Lutz to a triple Axel. In the free skating, he pulled up to first with a score of 206.67, but overall finished second behind Nathan Chen, by less than 4 points, and over bronze medalist Shoma Uno, by more than 15.|$|E
25|$|At the 2017 World Team Trophy Hanyu came {{in seventh}} {{place in the}} men's short program. He popped his quadruple loop to a single loop and did not receive any points for this jump. He also put his right hand on the ice during the quadruple <b>Salchow</b> {{and was unable to}} {{complete}} the combination, taking another sharp drop in points. In his free skating Hanyu placed first after receiving 200.49 points for a routine that featured four quadruple jumps (with three {{in the second half of}} the program for the first time in history), including a quadruple toe loop-half loop-triple <b>Salchow</b> combination. Overall he added 18 points to the team score, to help Team Japan win gold.|$|E
25|$|At {{his first}} {{competition}} of the season, Skate Canada Autumn Classic International, he received 112.72 points for his short program. Hanyu cleanly executed the quadruple <b>Salchow,</b> the triple Axel and the quadruple toe loop-triple toe loop combination, breaking {{the world record}} he had set previously at the 2015-16 Grand Prix Final (110.95). In this competition, due to a pain in his right knee, the quadruple loop jump {{was replaced by the}} quadruple <b>Salchow.</b> During the free skating, Hanyu popped the opening jump into a single Lutz and fell on a triple Axel, which was uncharacteristic for him. He also had troubles with other jumps and his quadruple toe loop was downgraded for a two-footed landing. He got a score of 155.52 points, and was surpassed by Fernández.|$|E
50|$|At the 1999 Four Continents, Zhang {{became the}} first skater to land a clean quadruple toe loop in the short program at an ISU Championship. He has also landed quadruple <b>salchows</b> in competition. He is the second person to land three quadruple jumps in one program. At the 2006 World Championships, the day before his 30th birthday, he landed a 4T-3T {{combination}} and 4S in his free skate. He named Elvis Stojko as his idol in the sport.|$|R
5000|$|Han Cong ( [...] ; born August 6, 1992 in Harbin, Heilongjiang) is a Chinese pair skater. With partner Sui Wenjing, {{he is the}} 2017 world champion, 2015 and 2016 world silver {{medalist}}, {{a two-time}} Grand Prix Final bronze medalist (2010, 2014), a four-time Four Continents champion (2012, 2014, 2016-2017), a three-time World Junior champion (2010-2012), the 2009 Junior Grand Prix Final champion, and a two-time Chinese national champion (2010, 2011). Sui and Han have landed throw quadruple <b>salchows</b> and quadruple twists in competition.|$|R
50|$|Combinations {{are defined}} as two or more jumps in which the {{take-off}} edge of the second (or third) jump {{is the same as}} the landing edge of the first jump. The most common jumps on the back end of a combination are the toe loop and loop because they take off from a back outside edge. Loops are more likely to be judged as under-rotated or downgraded. To execute combinations ending with <b>Salchows</b> or flips, a half loop, which lands on a backward inside edge, is employed as a connecting jump.|$|R
25|$|Lipinski is {{best known}} for her {{consistent}} athletic ability which included a number of difficult jumping passes. She completed a triple loop/triple loop and a triple toe/half loop/triple <b>Salchow.</b> These combinations are very rare to this day. Lipinski's jumps were tight in the air with very fast rotations, and her double Axel technique became very popular among many skaters for years to come.|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{figure skating}} pair Zhang Dan and Zhang Hao, {{trailing}} a dominant Russian pair, attempted a throw quadruple <b>salchow</b> jump—an element {{which had never}} been successfully completed in competition. Zhang Dan fell, injuring her knee, but the pair finished their program to a standing ovation and took the silver medal. Russia finished {{the third day of}} competition with two gold medals, as did the United States.|$|E
25|$|On April 26, the Japan Skating Federation {{announced}} that Hanyu {{will be taking}} two months off the ice to heal from injury. He had been dealing with pain in his left foot {{since the beginning of}} the season, which got worse in January. The pain caused him to change his program at Worlds, doing a quadruple <b>Salchow</b> instead of quadruple toe loop. Hanyu was diagnosed with Lisfranc ligament damage in his left foot.|$|E
50|$|Zayak was {{the first}} woman to {{consistently}} land many triple jumps in her programs. At the 1982 World Championships, she landed six triple jumps to win the title, although four of them were triple toe loops. While she also had triple <b>salchows</b> and loops in her repertoire, they were less consistent. Zayak's skating contributed to the creation of what became informally known as the Zayak Rule, enacted at the 1982 ISU Congress, which states that a skater may not perform the same kind of triple jump more than twice, and for it to be given full credit on both occasions, one of the two triples must be incorporated into a combination or sequence. The rule encouraged skaters to display a greater variety of skills.|$|R
50|$|Plushenko skated in ice shows {{around the}} world while {{continuing}} to train for a possible return to competition by practicing quad <b>Salchows</b> and quad loops. In April 2011, he {{sent a letter to}} the Russian figure skating federation president, Aleksandr Gorshkov, seeking reinstatement. Plushenko said he hoped the ban was not a retaliation of his criticism of the judging at the Olympics and that he would like to return to competition with a clean slate. Although he said he would have liked to compete at the 2011 World Championships if the ban had been lifted, he did not feel he would have been ready due to lost training time as a result of injury. On 12 June 2011, it was announced that the ISU had reinstated him by a unanimous vote.|$|R
5000|$|In April and July 2012, Plushenko {{worked with}} Italian {{choreographer}} Pasquale Camerlengo {{on a new}} short program. In late June 2012, he also worked with Japanese choreographer Kenji Miyamoto on his free skating for the following season. His work on quad <b>Salchows</b> and Lutzes aggravated his spinal problem and he flew to Munich, Germany for surgery, which involved searing a disk hernia with a liquid. Although doctors recommended he stay off the ice for a month, Plushenko returned in seven days, explaining [...] "I felt that I need to run fast in order to defend my position. I had the National Championships coming up, so, not only did I start to train too early, but I started to train too intensely." [...] His decision led to complications and he received an injection, a block, in Saint Petersburg. He lost some of his jumps but got them back before the 2013 Russian Championships in Sochi, Russia. Plushenko won his 10th national title at the event. He said his plan was to compete at the 2013 European and World Championships if his health allowed him.|$|R
25|$|At the 2007 Cup of Russia, Kim won {{both the}} short program scoring 63.50 points {{and the free}} skate with 133.70 points, to finish first overall with 197.20 points, 24.43 ahead of silver {{medalist}} Yukari Nakano, which set a world record for the free skate score under the ISU Judging System. She executed triple flip-triple toe loop combination, a triple loop, a triple lutz-double toe loop combination, a double axel-triple toe loop combination, a triple lutz, triple <b>salchow</b> and double axel.|$|E
25|$|At the 2015 NHK Trophy, Hanyu placed {{first in}} the short program with a world record score of 106.33. He cleanly {{executed}} a quadruple <b>Salchow,</b> a quadruple toe loop-triple toe loop combination, and a triple Axel. In the free skating, Hanyu landed three clean quadruple jumps, two clean triple Axels, and five clean triple jumps to receive 216.07 and combined total of 322.40, breaking both world records. With this result, he has qualified for the Grand Prix Final in first place.|$|E
25|$|Kim {{started off}} the 2007–2008 season winning the 2007 Cup of China {{with a total}} score of 180.68 points, which was 24.34 ahead of silver {{medalist}} Caroline Zhang. She landed a triple flip-single toe loop combination, a triple Lutz, a double Axel and placed 3rd in the short program. But the next day, she hit a triple flip-triple toe loop combination, a triple loop, triple lutz-double toe loop combination, double axel-triple toe loop combination, a single lutz, a triple <b>salchow,</b> a double axel and three level-four spins to score 122.36 points in the free skating.|$|E
5000|$|Butyrskaya's car {{exploded}} {{outside her}} Moscow apartment on 23 December 1999. She said, [...] "I don't see {{any other reason}} for it than jealousy, pure human jealousy." [...] Tchaikovskaya stated [...] "In my 40 years of coaching I {{have never seen anything}} like it. I guess it's this crime wave that has taken over our cities and lives lately." [...] Entering the Russian Championships as the five-time defending champion, Butyrskaya finished second to Irina Slutskaya and then placed 3rd at the Grand Prix final behind Slutskaya and Kwan. At the 2000 European Championships, Butyrskaya was fourth in the short program but came away with a silver medal after a long program containing six triples, including a triple-triple sequence. At the 2000 World Championships, she placed first in the short program, scoring ten 5.9s. In 2000, the New York Times described her short program (Sarah Brightman's Scene d'Amour) as [...] "flowing, lyrical skating...a performance of rare elegance and beauty." [...] She dropped to third overall after missing two triple <b>salchows</b> in her long program and was awarded the bronze, her third World medal. Had she placed first or even second in the long program behind Kwan, she would have successfully defended her title.|$|R
25|$|Hanyu {{began his}} {{season at the}} 2013 Finlandia Trophy, where he {{won the gold medal}} after placing first in both the short program and free skating. He won silver in both of his 2013–14 Grand Prix events, the 2013 Skate Canada International and 2013 Trophée Eric Bompard, {{qualifying}} him for the 2013–14 Grand Prix Final. At the Grand Prix Final in Fukuoka, Hanyu placed first in the short program with 99.84 points and set a new world record. He also won the free skating with a personal best of 193.41 despite falling on the quadruple <b>Salchow</b> and won the title with a total score of 293.25 points.|$|E
25|$|At the 2015 Skate Canada International, {{he placed}} {{sixth in the}} short program with the score of 73.25 points after invalidating his popped quadruple toe loop into a double and {{breaking}} the Zayak Rule by executing a triple lutz-double toe loop instead of a planned triple lutz-triple toe loop. He also received a level three for his step sequence. In the free skating, he pulled up to second with a score of 186.29, about 4 points behind Patrick Chan, after executing three quadruple jumps including the quadruple <b>Salchow</b> and toe loop in the first half, and the quadruple toe loop-double toe loop. He finished second overall behind Patrick Chan and above Daisuke Murakami with a total score of 259.54.|$|E
25|$|At the 2017 Rostelecom Cup Hanyu {{was second}} after the short program. He under-rotated his opening quadruple loop jump and {{slightly}} lost balance after a poor landing. He also fell after his final jump, a quadruple toe loop-triple toe loop combination. The next day, Hanyu opened his free skating {{with the first}} quadruple Lutz he had ever landed in competition, earning +1.14 GOE. Hanyu then popped his quadruple loop jump into a triple, failed to do a combination on his quadruple <b>Salchow</b> jump, and popped his single quadruple toe loop jump. His performance pulled him to first with a score of 195.92. Overall, he finished second behind Nathan Chen by 3.02 points, and over bronze medalist Mikhail Kolyada.|$|E
25|$|At the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Lipinski skated {{her short}} program to {{music from the}} {{animated}} movie Anastasia, placing second to Kwan. In the long program, Lipinski performed seven triples, including a historic triple loop/triple loop combination and, at the end, a triple toe/half loop/triple <b>Salchow</b> sequence, to overtake Kwan for the gold medal. She became the youngest ladies' Olympic figure skating champion and the youngest individual gold medalist. (In 2014, Yulia Lipnitskaya, six days younger than Lipinski {{at the time of}} her Olympic victory, became the youngest Olympic gold medalist in ladies figure skating by winning gold with the Russian team in the team event, not the individual event as Lipinski had.) Lipinski trained at the Detroit Skating Club in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.|$|E
25|$|Hanyu {{began his}} {{season at the}} 2012 Finlandia Trophy, where he won the gold medal. He landed two quadruple jumps, a quad toe loop and a quad <b>salchow,</b> in his free skating; {{it was the first}} time he had a landed the latter jump in competition. Hanyu won the silver medal at his first Grand Prix event of the season, the 2012 Skate America. His short program score at Skate America, 95.07 points, was a new world record. At his second event, the 2012 NHK Trophy, he scored 95.32 in the short program, beating his own world record, and went on to win the gold medal in his hometown. Hanyu {{qualified}} for the 2012–13 Grand Prix Final in Sochi, where he finished second.|$|E
25|$|In March 2010, Kim competed at the 2010 World Championships in Turin, Italy. Kim {{said she}} had {{struggled}} with finding the motivation to compete at the World Championships after winning the {{gold medal at the}} Olympic Games. Kim placed seventh in the short program with 60.30 points. She opened with a triple lutz–triple toe loop combination, but had problems with her layback spin and spiral sequence after unseen problems with her boots. She rebounded in the free skate to win the program with 130.49 points completing a triple lutz–triple toe loop combination, a triple flip, a double axel–double toe loop–double loop combination, a double axel–triple toe loop combination and a triple lutz, but having trouble with her triple <b>salchow</b> and double axel. She won the silver medal totaling 190.79 points.|$|E
25|$|At the Trophée Eric Bompard, {{she placed}} {{first in the}} short program with the score of 76.08 points, 16.44 points ahead of Yukari Nakano. She {{successfully}} executed a triple lutz–triple toe loop combination, followed by a triple flip and a double axel. Her spiral sequence and all three spins were graded a level four. Opening with a triple lutz–triple toe loop combination and showing great artistic skills, she won the free skate scoring 133.95 points. She also executed a double axel–double toe loop–double loop, a double axel–triple toe loop, a triple <b>salchow,</b> a triple lutz and a double axel. She won the event with 210.03 points, 36.04 ahead of silver medalist Mao Asada. Kim set world records for the free skate and the overall score under the ISU Judging System at the competition.|$|E
25|$|In January 2013 due to {{her lack}} of {{competition}} in the previous season, Kim had {{to compete in the}} 2013 South Korean Championships to pick herself a spot for the 2013 World Championships. She placed first in the short program with a score of 64.97 points despite having some problems in that segment of the competition. She also won the free skate totaling 145.80 after performing a clean program where she executed a triple lutz–triple toe loop combination, a triple flip, a triple <b>salchow,</b> a triple lutz, a double axel–double toe loop–double loop combination, a triple salchow–double toe loop combination and a double axel. Her total score of 210.77 points was 48.89 ahead of silver medalist Park So-youn. As a result, Kim won her fifth national title and thus qualified to compete in the World Championships.|$|E
