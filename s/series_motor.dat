5|$|The 2007 Indy Japan 300 was an IndyCar <b>Series</b> <b>motor</b> race held on April 21, 2007, at the Twin Ring Motegi in Motegi, Tochigi, Japan. It was {{the third}} race of the 2007 IndyCar Series season, the fifth annual edition of the Indy Japan 300 in the IndyCar Series, and the tenth anniversary running of the race (including its five years on the Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) schedule). Andretti Green Racing driver Tony Kanaan won the race with a 0.4828 second margin of victory over Chip Ganassi Racing's Dan Wheldon. Dario Franchitti, Scott Dixon, and Sam Hornish Jr. rounded out the top five.|$|E
25|$|After his {{retirement}} from F1, Amon dedicated himself to running {{the family farm}} in New Zealand's Manawatu District for many years. After retiring from farming, he lived in Taupo in New Zealand's North Island. In the early 1980s he became more well known in New Zealand from test-driving vehicles on the TV motoring <b>series</b> <b>Motor</b> Show and later consulted for Toyota New Zealand, tuning the 1984 Toyota Corolla and subsequent cars for sale there. He also appeared in TV commercials for the company, where much {{was made of the}} acclaim he won from Enzo Ferrari. Amon participated in the 2004 EnergyWise Rally where he won ahead of Brian Cowan. Amon drove a Toyota Prius for the event.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, Lotus {{decided to}} shed its kit car image and {{concentrate}} on limited <b>series</b> <b>motor</b> racing cars and up-market sports cars. As part of this plan, it sold {{the rights to the}} Seven to its only remaining agents, Caterham Cars in England and Steel Brothers Limited in New Zealand. At the time the current production car was the Series 4, but when Caterham ran out of the Lotus Series 4 kits in 1974 they introduced its own version of the Series 3, as the Caterham Seven. The modern day Roadsports and Superlights (in [...] "narrow-bodied chassis" [...] form) are the direct descendants of this car and therefore of the original Lotus 7.|$|E

50|$|A <b>series</b> <b>motor</b> {{should never}} be started at no load. With no {{mechanical}} load on the <b>series</b> <b>motor,</b> the current is low, the counter-EMF produced by the field winding is weak, and so the armature must turn faster to produce sufficient counter-EMF to balance the supply voltage. The motor can be damaged by overspeed. This is called a runaway condition.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} assessing use of <b>series</b> DC <b>motor</b> in electric car with its rotation speed controller, and evaluating its performances when different running cases of electric car with different loads. The mathematical equations model of <b>series</b> DC <b>motor</b> and electronic inverter in dynamic state with reference frame d – q were considered. Computer model of these equations was implemented using MATLAB/SIMPOWER facilities obtaining a complete model for motor and controller. Series DC motor is considered and its parameters were used for simulation. The electronic controller operates based on PWM control technique. Simulation of <b>series</b> DC <b>motor</b> performances was conducted within presumptions of changing car load and different resistant torques. Changing loads was realised changing number of passengers when electric car is running on normal streets, when running on streets with slope, when car is accelerate to reach a stead speed and when car is changing speed rigidly and suddenly running on country road having some holes and small slopes. Some conclusions and remarks about performances and behaviour of <b>series</b> DC <b>motor</b> were concluded. The simulated <b>series</b> DC <b>motor</b> was tested and mounted experimentally in a small truck car in Faculty of Mechanical & Electrical Engineering at Damascus University...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} of operating the three phase slip-ring induction <b>motor</b> as a <b>series</b> connected <b>motor</b> is explored. The merits and drawbacks of {{this mode of}} operation are discussed. For this purpose the necessary mathematical models along with the corresponding computer simulation are developed and experimental verification of the theoretical results is also carried out. It {{has been found in}} general that operation of slip-ring induction <b>motors</b> as <b>series</b> connected <b>motors</b> is possible providing that the rotor winding is connected in a sequence opposite to that of the stator winding. This adds flexibility to the modes of operation of these motors. Moreover synchronous operation is also possible, providing that the <b>series</b> connected <b>motor</b> is driven initially at twice its synchronous speed and then connected to the supply. © 1997 IEE...|$|R

50|$|The {{main reason}} why {{electrification}} at this voltage {{had not been}} used before {{was the lack of}} reliability of mercury-arc-type rectifiers that could fit on the train. This in turn related to the requirement to use DC <b>series</b> <b>motors,</b> which required the current to be converted from AC to DC and for that a rectifier is needed. Until the early 1950s, mercury-arc rectifiers were difficult to operate even in ideal conditions and were therefore unsuitable for use in the railway industry.|$|R
