The detector's output is converted to sound by the earphone. Early sets used a cat's whisker detector, consisting of a fine wire touching {{the surface of a}} sample of crystalline mineral such as galena.

2500|$|Response time: A photon {{absorbed by}} the {{semiconducting}} material will generate an electron-hole pair which will in turn start moving in the material under {{the effect of the}} electric field and thus generate a current. The finite duration of this current is known as the transit-time spread and can be evaluated by using Ramo's theorem. One can also show with this theorem that the total charge generated in the external circuit is well e and not 2e as might seem by the presence of the two carriers. Indeed, the integral of the current due to both electron and hole over time must be equal to e. The resistance and capacitance of the photodiode and the external circuitry give rise to another response time known as RC time constant [...] This combination of R and C integrates the photoresponse over time and thus lengthens the impulse response of the photodiode. When used in an optical communication system, the response time determines the bandwidth available for <b>signal</b> <b>modulation</b> and thus data transmission.|$|E
2500|$|The signal {{strength}} received on Earth from Huygens was {{comparable to that}} from the Galileo probe (the Jupiter atmospheric descent probe) as received by the VLA, and was therefore too weak to detect in real time because of the <b>signal</b> <b>modulation</b> by the (then) unknown telemetry. Instead, wide-band recordings of the probe signal were made throughout the three-hour descent. After the probe telemetry was finished being relayed from Cassini to Earth, the now-known data modulation was stripped off the recorded signal, leaving a pure carrier that could be integrated over several seconds to determine the probe frequency. It was expected that through analysis of the Doppler shifting of Huygens signal as it descended through the atmosphere of Titan, wind speed and direction could be determined {{with some degree of}} accuracy. A position of Huygens' landing site on Titan was found with precision (within one km – one km on Titan measures 1.3' latitude and longitude at the equator) using the Doppler data at a distance from Earth of about 1.2 billion kilometers. The probe landed {{on the surface of the}} moon at [...] A similar technique was used to determine the landing site of the Mars exploration rovers by listening to their telemetry alone.|$|E

This process leads to unavoid-able losses in nuclear polarization, which are difﬁcult to evaluate once the solution has been injected into an animal. Wepropose a method to measure the polarization of the hyperpolarized molecules inside the imager bore, 3 s following dis-solution, {{at the time of}} the injection, using a precise quantiﬁcation of the infusate concentration. This in situ quantiﬁca-tion allows for distinguishing between <b>signal</b> <b>modulations</b> related to variations in the nuclear polarization at the time ofthe injection and <b>signal</b> <b>modulations</b> related to physiological processes such as tissue perfusion. In addition, our methodincludes a radical scavenging process that leads to a minor reduction in sample concentration and takes place within acouple of seconds following the dissolution in order to minimize the losses due to the presence of paramagnetic polar-izing agent in the infusate. We showed that proton exchange between vitamin C, the scavenging molecule and the deu-terated solvent shortens the long carboxyl 13 C longitudinal relaxation time in [1 - 13 C]acetate. This additional source ofdipolar relaxation can be avoided by using deuterated ascorbate. Overall, the method allows for a substantial gain inpolarization and also leads to an extension of the time window available for in vivo measurements...|$|R
