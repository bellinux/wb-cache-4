A common formal basis for representing the semantics of dynamic composition of <b>services</b> from <b>service</b> <b>components</b> is presented. We propose a logic and a specification language that enable us to reason about and deploy <b>service</b> <b>components</b> automatically. The proposed composition model uses a logical proof as witness for the correct deployment of <b>service</b> <b>components</b> {{in the context of}} their use. The composition model has been implemented in Java as an environment for dynamic composition of services.

In this paper we introduce a two-dimensional approach where <b>service</b> <b>components</b> are roles defined using UML 2. 0 collaborations and system components are agents representing domain entities such as users and terminals. The process of dynamic role binding takes place during service execution and provides general mechanisms to handle context dependency, personalisation, resource limitations and compatibility validation.

The logic businesses of the service platform are often provided by several distributed <b>service</b> <b>components,</b> so {{the management of the}} service platform has to cover these components. Aiming at an efficient way of managing the <b>service</b> <b>components</b> under the <b>service</b> platform, we introduced the configuration and management system. We build it by defining an information model for the <b>service</b> <b>components,</b> which captures the information needed to the management of services. We propose our system design and implementation to support the management of service platform. The system is mainly composed of five parts: model repository, configuration model, configuration restrictions, configuration editor and management user interface. Then we introduce an application of the system. Finally we give a conclusion...|$|R

40|$|The {{creation}} of composite <b>services</b> from <b>service</b> <b>components</b> at runtime {{can be achieved}} using several different techniques.

In the second approach, a new composite service is formed where all of the functionality of the <b>service</b> <b>components</b> is interconnected but the <b>service</b> <b>components</b> remain distinct.
