5|$|The England {{team had}} not {{suffered}} such uncertainty since the West Indies tour of England in 1966, where the <b>selectors</b> chose 23 different players and three different captains (Colin Cowdrey, M. J. K. Smith and Brian Close) and England lost the five-Test series 3–1. Notably, Peter May {{was on the}} Board of <b>Selectors</b> for the 1966 series, while {{he was chairman of}} the board of <b>Selectors</b> for the 1988 series.|$|E
5|$|If the <b>selectors</b> are right, Egar is wrong, {{and if he}} is {{incapable}} of interpreting the laws correctly, he should not stand in first-class cricket. On the other hand if the <b>selectors</b> as a body threw Meckiff into this arena merely to be tested by the opinion of a single umpire, they are very much guilty of passing the buck, and of exposing both the bowler and the umpire to extreme embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|After his Test debut, Hunt was {{expected}} to be the Queensland fullback in the first match of the three game State of Origin series. However, Queensland <b>selectors</b> decided to stay with incumbent Origin fullback Matt Bowen. The <b>selectors</b> reconsidered after Queensland lost the first game, selecting Hunt for the second match. In his State of Origin debut, Hunt ran with the ball seventeen times, making 196 metres. He missed the third Origin game because of a foot injury, sustained in the Broncos' Round 15 match, and was replaced by Clinton Schifcofske.|$|E

50|$|While CSS3 {{supports}} the Document Object Model (DOM) hierarchy, {{it does not}} allow <b>selector</b> inheritance. In Sass, inheritance is achieved by inserting a line inside of a code block that uses the @extend keyword and references another <b>selector.</b> The extended <b>selector's</b> attributes are applied to the calling <b>selector.</b>|$|R
5|$|Barnes {{needed a}} score to {{rehabilitate}} {{himself in the}} eyes of the Test <b>Selectors</b> and he spent all Saturday over 131runs while 20,000 impatient spectators barracked loudly. His dismissal on the third day evoked cheers all round the ground.|$|E
5|$|During {{his absence}} from the Test team, the Australian <b>selectors</b> had been {{unsuccessful}} {{in their attempts to}} find a reliable partner for Arthur Morris to open the batting. Barnes started the season solidly and, in the last match before the team for the third Test against the West Indies was chosen, he hit 107 against Victoria. The <b>selectors</b> duly picked him for the match, then passed the team list to the Board of Control for ratification. The Board vetoed the inclusion of Barnes and requested the nomination of a replacement player. Unwilling to accept the blame for Barnes's omission, the <b>selectors</b> deliberately deferred their decision on the replacement. When the team was not announced at the scheduled time, journalists uncovered the story and Barnes became a cause célèbre for many weeks, missing all of the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass; insulting the Royal Family; theft from team-mates; drunkenness; and stealing a car.|$|E
5|$|Following Australia's {{unlikely}} win at Headingley, the England <b>selectors</b> {{were widely}} condemned for {{their failure to}} choose a specialist wrist spinner to exploit the turning pitch. This was cited {{as a reason for}} the hosts' loss, as the part-timer Compton was able to trouble the batsmen and generate opportunities for wickets, only to see them foregone because of missed catches and stumpings. In response, the English <b>selectors</b> made four changes to the team for the Fifth Test, one of these being the inclusion of leg spinner Eric Hollies. Their frequent changes to the team meant the hosts used a total of 21 players for the five Tests, and the repeated changes to personnel resulted in heavy criticism.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new phase}} <b>selector</b> based on adaptive resonance theory (ART). Because conventional phase <b>selector</b> cannot adapt dynamically to the power system operating conditions, it presents different characters under different power system conditions. To overcome the disadvantage, an adaptive phase <b>selector,</b> which utilizes artificial neural network based on ART, is designed. ART based neural network (ARTNN) has some advantages such as no local extremum, quickly convergence and so on. Therefore, the proposed ARTNN based phase <b>selector</b> has better performances compared with other neural networks based phase <b>selector,</b> and the new <b>selector</b> can adapt dynamically to the varying power system operation conditions. Furthermore, the phase <b>selector</b> can be trained and learned on-line. A lot of EMTP simulations and experimental field data tests have illustrated the phase <b>selector’s</b> correctness and effectiveness...|$|R

5|$|Nash {{spent five}} years out of the cricketing {{spotlight}} (although he dominated Melbourne district cricket, the Victorian <b>selectors</b> refused to select him and he never played a Sheffield Shield match). In 1936–1937 he topped the district cricket bowling averages.|$|E
5|$|A left-handed opening batsman, Morris {{played in}} all five Tests, partnering the {{right-handed}} Sid Barnes in three Tests—Barnes was injured {{for the other}} two Tests.

50|$|For example, 9 to 16 inputs {{would require}} {{no fewer than}} 4 <b>selector</b> pins and 17 to 32 inputs would require no fewer than 5 <b>selector</b> pins. The binary value {{expressed}} on these <b>selector</b> pins determines the selected input pin.|$|R
5|$|Around this time, and {{particularly}} after the fourth Test defeat, critics suggested that Walter Robins, {{one of the}} <b>selectors,</b> should captain England to bring a more attacking approach to the job. However, Robins' age counted against him; the <b>selectors</b> were satisfied with Yardley's captaincy in what were difficult circumstances, and retained him for the final Test. In that match, he failed twice with the bat, scoring 7 and 9 as England were humiliated, bowled out for 52 and 188 to lose by an innings. England lost the series 4–0. Yardley managed 150 runs {{at an average of}} 16.66, not passing fifty in a single innings. However, he once again topped the England bowling averages, taking nine wickets at an average of 22.66. Bowes believed that the pressure of captaincy had affected Yardley's batting. Bowes also cast doubt on Yardley's future, stating that other commitments may have prevented his continuing to play cricket much longer.|$|E
5|$|Australia fell to {{successive}} defeats in {{the opening}} two Tests, Bradman making two ducks in his four innings, {{and it seemed that}} the captaincy was affecting his form. The <b>selectors</b> made another four changes to the team for the Third Test at Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{his form}} for the Services, Hassett was {{selected}} in the Australian team for a brief five-match tour of New Zealand in February and March 1946. As the military men played poorly in Australia, the national <b>selectors</b> concluded that their achievements against England must have been against weak opposition, and only Hassett and Miller were selected for the Australian tour of New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|Locking {{the output}} shaft with a gear is {{achieved}} {{by means of a}} dog clutch <b>selector.</b> The dog clutch is a sliding <b>selector</b> mechanism which is splined to the output shaft, meaning that its hub has teeth that fit into slots (splines) on the shaft, forcing that shaft to rotate with it. However, the splines allow the <b>selector</b> to move {{back and forth on the}} shaft, which happens when it is pushed by a <b>selector</b> fork that is linked to the gear lever. The fork does not rotate, so it is attached to a collar bearing on the <b>selector.</b> The <b>selector</b> is typically symmetric: it slides between two gears and has a synchromesh and teeth on each side in order to lock either gear to the shaft.|$|R
40|$|<b>Selector</b> languages, or {{crosscut}} languages, play {{an important}} role in aspect-oriented programming (AOP). Examples of prominent <b>selector</b> languages include the pointcut language in AspectJ, traversal specications in Demeter, XPath, and regular expressions. A <b>selector</b> language expression, also re-ferred to as a <b>selector,</b> selects nodes on an instance graph (an execution tree or an object tree) that satises a meta graph (a call graph or a class graph). The implementation of <b>selector</b> languages requires practically ecient algorithms for problems such as: Does a <b>selector</b> always (or never) se-lect certain nodes Select-Always (Select-Never), does a <b>selector</b> ever select a node Select-Sat, does one <b>selector</b> im-ply another <b>selector</b> Select-Impl or may an edge in an in-stance graph lead to a node selected by the <b>selector</b> Select-Completion. We study these problems from the viewpoints of two impor-tant <b>selector</b> languages called SAJ, inspired by AspectJ, and SD, inspired by Demeter, and several of their sublanguages. We show a polynomial-time two-way reduction between SD and SAJ revealing interesting connections promoting trans-fer of algorithmic techniques from AspectJ to Demeter and vice-versa. We provide several practically useful polynomial-time algorithms for some of the problems, and we show oth-ers to be NP- or co-NP-complete. We present a xed param-eter tractable (FPT) algorithm for one of the NP-complete problems. This early result indicates a line of attack for dealing with the intractability inherent in these problems. The paper provides a list of algorithmic results that are of interest to developers of scalable AOP tools. We discuss the consequences of this paper for our DAJ implementation...|$|R

5|$|Craig's innings also {{caught the}} eye of Australian <b>selectors</b> and he was {{selected}} for the Test team. He was named twelfth man for the Fourth Test, before making his debut in the Fifth Test after Miller and Ray Lindwall were rested due to mild injuries. Australia were leading the series 2–1 heading into the deciding match.|$|E
5|$|Despite his low {{score in}} the {{preceding}} match against Middlesex, Harvey was called into the team for the Fourth Test at Headingley {{at the expense of}} Barnes. The <b>selectors</b> had overlooked Brown as a replacement for Barnes's opening position. Instead, vice-captain Hassett would move from the middle-order to accompany Morris {{at the top of the}} innings, while Harvey would slot into the middle-order.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Wales loss against Australia, the <b>selectors</b> kept {{faith with}} John, and he {{retained}} his {{place for the}} next Wales international. Played away from home, the opener of the 1967 Five Nations Championship against Scotland had him paired at half-back with Cardiff's Billy Hullin. John played badly while carrying a leg injury, and the very next match he was dropped, replaced by the more experienced Watkins.|$|E
40|$|Geometrical {{design of}} the spiral crystal <b>selector</b> can affect crystal {{orientation}} in the final single crystal structure. To achieve {{a better understanding of}} conditions associated with the onset of crystal orientation in a spiral crystal <b>selector,</b> temperature field was investigated using three-dimensional finite element method during the process. Different geometries of spiral crystal <b>selector</b> were used to produce Al- 3 wt. % Cu alloy single crystal using a Bridgman type furnace. The Crystal orientation of the samples was determined using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and optical microscopy. Analysing the temperature field in the crystal <b>selector</b> revealed that, the orientation of growing dendrites against liquidus isotherm in the spiral <b>selector</b> was the reason for crystal misorientation which differs in various <b>selector</b> geometries. Increasing the take-off angle from 35 ° up to 45 ° increases the misorientation with respect to direction. Further increase of take-off angle greater than 45 ° will decrease the crystal misorientation again and the efficiency of the <b>selector</b> to produce a single grain is decreased...|$|R

5|$|Don Bradman toured England in 1948 with an Australian cricket {{team that}} went undefeated in their 34 tour matches, {{including}} the five Ashes Tests. Bradman was the captain, {{one of three}} <b>selectors,</b> and overall a dominant figure of what was {{regarded as one of}} the finest teams of all time, earning the sobriquet The Invincibles.|$|E
5|$|Harvey was {{appointed}} to captain an Australian XI in a warm-up match against the touring Englishmen, indicating that the <b>selectors</b> were considering him for the Test captaincy. Harvey scored a duck and 38 and the Australians lost heavily by 345 runs on a wicket with a crater. Therefore, Benaud was made Australian captain ahead of Harvey.|$|E
5|$|In April 2006, Karthik's {{career was}} revived {{when he was}} {{recalled}} to the ODI team by <b>selectors</b> to give Dhoni a rest in the final ODI against England in Indore. He was not required to bat as India cruised to a seven-wicket victory.|$|E
