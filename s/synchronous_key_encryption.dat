Hence, researchers give great effort to pursue public <b>key</b> public <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> with publicly verifiability in the standard model. However, all the existing CCA secure publicly verifiable public <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> in the standard model relies on costly bilinear pairing. In this paper, based on Hanaoka and Kurosawa’s efficient CCA secure public <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> under Computational Diffle-Hellman assumption proposed in Asiacrypt’ 08 and the famous Cramer-Shoup encryption scheme, we try to construct a CCA secure public verifiable public <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> without pairing in the standard model. As {{a result of its}} application, we achieve a CCA secure public verifiable threshold public <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> without pairing in the standard model, a CCA secure unidirectional proxy re-encryption without pairing in the standard model...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} public <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> {{that allows}} the originator of a ciphertext to retrieve a “forgotten ” plaintext from the ciphertext. This type of public <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> with “backward recovery ” contrasts more widely analyzed public <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> with “forward secrecy”. We advocate that together they form {{the two sides of}} a whole coin, whereby offering complementary roles in data security, especially in cloud computing, 3 G/ 4 G communications and other emerging computing and communication platforms. We formalize the notion of public <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> with backward recovery, and present two construction methods together with formal analyses of their security. The first method embodies a generic public <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> scheme with backward recovery using the “encrypt then sign ” paradigm, whereas the second method provides a more efficient scheme that is built on Hofheinz and Kiltz’s public <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> in conjunction with target collision resistant hashing. Security of the first method is proved in a two-user setting, whereas the second is in a more general multi-user setting. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Encryption is {{a process}} of {{generating}} secrect text from the input text using a secret <b>key</b> and a <b>encryption</b> algorithm. Input text is refered to as plain text and the secret text generated is known as cipher text. Encryption algorithms are mainly divided into two categories which are symmetric <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> algorithm and asymmetric <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> algorithm. In Symmetric <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> algorithm the same key is used by both sender and receiver but in asymmetric key algorithm sender and receiver both uses the different keys. In this paper, we present a technique based on symmetric <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> algorithm which uses ASCII vales of input text to encrypt the data. Text data encryption techniques are very useful in data communication where one user want to send some secret messages to another users...|$|R

This makes possible public <b>key</b> <b>encryption,</b> since an <b>encryption</b> <b>key</b> can be published without compromising the security of messages encrypted with that key.|$|R

40|$|Different {{from the}} {{traditional}} public <b>key</b> <b>encryption,</b> searchable public <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> allows a data owner to encrypt his data under a user’s public key {{in such a way}} that the user can generate search token keys using her secret key and then query an encryption storage server. On receiving such a search token key, the server filters all or related stored encryptions and returns matched ones as response. Searchable pubic <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> has many promising applications. Unfortunately, existing schemes either only support simple query predicates, such as equality queries and conjunctive queries, or have a superpolynomial blowup in ciphertext size and search token key size. In this paper, based on the key-policy attribute-based encryption scheme proposed by Lewko et al. recently, we present a new construction of searchable public <b>key</b> <b>encryption.</b> Compared to previous works in this field, our construction is much more expressive and efficient and is proven secure in the standard model...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{construction}} of a CCA 2 -secure encryption scheme from a plaintext aware, weakly simulatable public <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> scheme. The notion of plaintext aware, weakly simulatable public <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> has been considered previously by Myers, Sergi and shelat (SCN, 2012) and natural encryption schemes such as the Damg˚ard Elgamal Scheme (Damg˚ard, Crypto, 1991) and the Cramer-Shoup Lite Scheme (Cramer and Shoup, SIAM J. Comput., 2003) were shown to satisfy these properties. Recently, Myers, Sergi and shelat (SCN, 2012) defined an extension of non-malleable CCA 1 security, called cNM-CCA 1, and showed how to construct a cNM-CCA 1 -secure encryption scheme from a plaintext aware and weakly simulatable public <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> scheme.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to broaden the}} foundations of public-key cryptography. We construct new public <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> schemes based on new hardness-on-average assumptions for natural combinatorial NP-hard optimization problems. We consider the following assumptions: 1. It is infeasible to solve a random set of sparse linear equations mod 2, of which a small fraction is noisy. 2. It is infeasible to distinguish between a random unbalanced bipartite graph, and such a graph in which we “plant ” at random in the large side a set S with only |S|/ 3 neighbors. 3. There is a pseudorandom generator in NC 0 where every output depends on a random constant-size subset of the inputs. We obtain semantically secure public <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> schemes based on several combinations of these assumptions with different parameters. In particular we obtain public <b>key</b> <b>encryption</b> from Assumption 1 on its own, yielding the first noisy-equations type public key scheme in which the noise rate is higher than one over the square root of equations.
