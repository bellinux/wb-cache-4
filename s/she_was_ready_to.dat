5|$|After {{the release}} of Selena's {{full-length}} Spanish albums Selena (1989) and Ven Conmigo (1990), which included Tejano and other Mexican pop styles, she decided that her next recording would feature an English-language song. She believed that such a song would convince EMI Records' chairman Charles Koppelman that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> release a crossover album. EMI had wanted her to acquire a larger fan base before launching her crossover career. In spite of this, Selena included the song on Entre a Mi Mundo.|$|E
5|$|Incumbent Prime Minister Kiviniemi {{said that}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> work with any party in Finland. When pressed {{by the media}} {{she said that she}} would not rule out working with the True Finns pending {{cooperation}} on negotiating a government platform. The True Finns and the Green League have both confirmed that the two parties are ideologically too far from each other to sit in the same coalition. The True Finns' main campaign issues—lowering refugee quotas and cutting foreign aid and Finland's financial contribution to the EU—were seen as a possible hindrance to coalition talks.|$|E

Most importantly, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> recognise the mental superiority {{of some of}} her advisers and {{to give way to}} a superior mind while enjoying support of her ministers even if their ideas differed from her own. Joseph, however, was never able to establish rapport with the same advisers, even though their philosophy of government was closer to Joseph's than to Maria Theresa's.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the novel brought Rand new {{publishing}} opportunities. Bobbs-Merrill offered to publish a nonfiction book expanding on the ethical ideas presented in The Fountainhead. Though this book was never completed, {{a portion of the}} material was used for an article in the January 1944 issue of Reader's Digest. Rand was also able to get an American publisher for Anthem, which previously had been published in England, but not in the United States. When <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> submit Atlas Shrugged to publishers, over a dozen competed to acquire the new book.|$|E

She won two Golden Globe Awards for both these films, {{and for the}} latter, she was awarded the Academy Award and BAFTA Award for Best Actress. She surpassed her own record as the youngest actress with the most Oscar nominations, with her sixth nod at age 33. She also became the third actress in history to win two Golden Globe Awards at the same ceremony. Exhausted by the media attention she received during this period, Winslet took two years off work until <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> creatively engage again.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} two years of her contract, Bush spent more time on school work than making an album. She left school after doing her mock A-levels and having gained ten GCE O-Level qualifications. In 2005, Bush stated in an {{interview}} with Mark Radcliffe on BBC Radio 2 that she believed EMI signed her before <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> make an album so that no other record company could offer her a contract. After the contract signing, EMI forwarded her a sizeable advance which she used to enroll in interpretive dance classes taught by Lindsay Kemp, a former teacher of David Bowie, and mime training with Adam Darius.|$|E
5|$|Northumberland, {{named after}} the {{ceremonial}} county, was ordered on 2 September 1861 from the Millwall Ironworks. She was laid down on 10 October 1861 at its shipyard in Millwall, London. She was altered while on the building slip after Sir Edward Reed succeeded Isaac Watts as Chief Constructor. Unlike her half-sisters, the ship spent five years on the stocks before <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be launched, partially due to frequent changes in design, although Northumberland was much closer to completion. The additional weight caused her stick for {{an hour on the}} slipway before she slid halfway down with her stern only supported by air, threatening to buckle the ship. Efforts by hydraulic jacks and tugboats failed to get her into the water on the next spring tide failed, but the use of pontoons on 17 April 1866 proved successful. Her builders went into bankruptcy while the ship was being launched and the liquidators seized Northumberland as a company asset once she was in the water. Eight months passed before the Admiralty could take possession and begin fitting out the ship. She was commissioned in October 1868 and completed on 8 October for a cost a total of £444,256.|$|E

25|$|In September 1880, Behan and Sadie left Tip Top for Tombstone. Soon {{after they}} arrived, Behan's ex-wife sent their eight-year-old son Albert {{to live with}} him. In reconstructing her life story, Josephine said years later that she {{actually}} lived with Kitty Jones and her husband, a lawyer, {{while working as a}} housekeeper for Behan. Boyer and other modern researchers argue that she actually lived with Behan. In Josephine's version of her life story, she left San Francisco to join Behan to Tombstone in October, 1880, and was hoping he would fulfill his promises to marry her. When he delayed, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> leave him.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, {{shortly after}} {{becoming}} a United States citizen, Navratilova gave {{an interview to}} New York Daily News sports reporter Steve Goldstein, coming out as bisexual and revealing {{that she had a}} sexual relationship with Rita Mae Brown, but asked him not to publish the article until <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> come out publicly. However, the New York Daily News published the article on July 30, 1981. Navratilova and Nancy Lieberman, her girlfriend at the time, gave an interview to Dallas Morning News columnist Skip Bayless, where Navratilova reiterated that she was bisexual and Lieberman identified herself as straight. Navratilova has since identified herself as a lesbian.|$|E

Firth, a leading executive of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and his wife. The voyage proved not without incident as the ship shed propellor blades during the transatlantic crossing, and she arrived at Liverpool under sail, after which she {{spent some time in}} drydock undergoing repairs. By June 23 <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> make the return voyage, with a full complement of passengers and a substantial cargo.

His solicitor, William Clegg, tried to prove that Mrs. Dyson had been on more intimate terms with Peace than <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> admit, and that Dyson had been the aggressor in a struggle in which Peace had reacted in self-defence. A number of pencilled notes had been found near the scene, which {{appeared to have been}} written by Mrs. Dyson, indicating a close relationship with Peace, though she denied having written them. (At the Coroner's inquest after the murder, she said her husband had seen them and declared them to be forgeries, possibly by Peace himself.) After the hearing, Peace was committed to take his trial at the Leeds Assizes, to begin on 4 February 1879.|$|E
25|$|In September 2012, Maroney {{was injured}} during an uneven bars {{dismount}} while performing at the Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastics Champions in Ontario, California. An MRI revealed {{that she had}} fractured the tibia in her left leg. The injury occurred shortly before teammate Aly Raisman injured herself performing on the same bars. On September 13, 2012, Maroney had two screws inserted to repair the fractured left tibia. She wore an immobilizer to keep the leg straight until doctors determined that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> resume limited walking and rebuilding range of motion. Maroney returned to The Kellogg's Tour on October 4, 2012 in Oklahoma City on light duty.

25|$|The Council of the Charter of Journalistic Ethics in Georgia had {{a meeting}} on 25 March 2010, in which they {{discussed}} journalistic ethics in the Georgian media. Special Report anchor Natia Koberidze was due to attend the meeting but later withdrew. Koberidze stated that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> attend the Council meeting, but due to its public format, decided to withdraw as the meeting {{could be used as}} a mean to attack her. Eter Turadze, the Council head, stated at the meeting that it was not being held to punish anyone, although sanctions could be considered if the Council felt that journalistic ethical norms were breached. Turadze also said that the stated aim of the meeting was to call upon journalists to act according to ethical norms. As a result of Koberidze's non-attendance at the meeting, the Council sent her 16 questions via email, which among other things asked her who was responsible for the fake news report being broadcast with visible warnings that it was only a simulation, and whether she had been put under any pressure. Koberidze replied to the questionnaire by saying that she did not violate the Charter, as warnings were given to viewers as the programme began that it was a simulation. She also stated she was not aware who was responsible for the absence of visible warnings during the programme.|$|E
