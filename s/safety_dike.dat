From the North Sea coast to the delta estuaries, this territorial system is formed by the confluence of three major rivers from northwest Europe: the Rhine, the Meuse and the Scheldt. The larger rivers of the Rhine and the Meuse are divided into Nederrijn-Lek, Waal-Merwede and IJssel, where river clay deposits are dominant. In the northwest region, the delta includes the former Zuiderzee {{and part of the}} marine clay deposits in Friesland, and in the southwest, it receives the contribution of the river Scheldt. In the northernmost part, the influence of the North Sea is predominant, where the delta mainly contains marine clay deposits (Nienhuis, 2008).

40|$|As {{transistor}} {{dimensions of}} Static Random AccessMemory (SRAM) become smaller {{with each new}} technology generation, they become increasingly susceptible to statistical variations in their parameters. These statistical variations can result in failing memory. SRAM {{is used as a}} building block for the construction of large Integrated Circuits (IC). To ensure SRAM does not degrade the yield (fraction of functional devices) of ICs, very low failure probabilities of Pfail = 10 - 10 are strived for. For instance in SRAMmemory design one aims to get a 0. 1 % yield loss for 10 Mbit memory, which means that 1 in 10 billion cells fails (Pfail = 10 - 10; this corresponds with an occurrence of - 6. 4 s when dealing with a normal distribution). To simulate such probabilities, traditional Monte-Carlo simulations are not sufficient and more advanced techniques are required. Importance Sampling is a technique that is relatively easy to implement and provides sufficiently accurate results. Importance sampling is a well known technique in statistics to estimate the occurrences of rare events. Rare or extreme events can be associated with dramatic costs, like in finance or because of reasons of <b>safety</b> in environment (<b>dikes,</b> power plants).

40|$|Introduction The {{popularity}} of monitoring dikes with sensor techniques is rising. It is claimed that sensor techniques lead to {{significant cost savings}} and can predict an upcoming dike collapse. But a technical foundation to use the sensor monitoring information in flood safety assessment is lacking. This research investigates the contribution of sensor monitoring information to flood safety and the cost-effectiveness of sensor monitoring. Sensor techniques have been tested in full-scale dike failure experiments at the IJkdijk, trying to predict an upcoming dike collapse. The sensor techniques are capable of monitoring deformation, temperature, water pressure, vibrations and moisture. The state of the sensor techniques is doubtful due to subjective analyses, controlled test conditions and a wide variety in failure prediction times: from 1, 5 to 102 hours. Implementation of sensor information Water pressure is the only variable that constitutes an input for <b>dike</b> <b>safety</b> assessment models. Monitoring water pressures affects the epistemic uncertainty of the water pressure schematization which {{is caused by the}} translation from the hydraulic load to water pressures. One must be aware that sensor monitoring either leads to an increased assessment of flood safety if the prior schematization turns out to be done conservatively or a decrease in flood safety if the prior schematization turns out too optimistic. One would expect an increased assessed flood safety due the intended conservative approach. But prior schematization mistakes imply a decreased assessed flood safety. Moreover, monitoring water pressures has minimum impact on the flood safety assessment if other uncertainty aspects dominate the stability assessment. A case study of the canal of Nauerna denotes that the water pressure has resulted in a higher assessed flood safety, but the uncertainties regarding the soil conditions dominate the stability assessment. However, sensor monitoring on itself does not affect the real flood safety: only physical measures affect the real risk of flooding. Important information is obtained from monitoring high water events such that water pressure models can be calibrated to determine design loading conditions for the periodic safety assessment. Also, an additional application is to identify unforeseen risks. Cost-benefit analysis Conceptual cost-benefit models have been set up to determine the cost-effectiveness of sensor monitoring over the long-term. The monitoring costs consist of installation, maintenance and operational costs. The benefit from permanent dike reinforcements is gained from specifying the long-term optimal investment strategy based on the minimum sum of flood risk and reinforcements costs. The monitoring information from relevant high water events affects the assessed flooding probability. If the sensor monitoring reduces the assessed flooding probability, the assessed flood risk lowers and savings on permanent dike reinforcements. If a higher flooding probability is obtained by sensor monitoring, this financially leads to additional investments and negative benefits. But the value of knowing this higher flood risk is rationally beneficial. The benefit from temporary measures is gained from timely execution of emergency measures based on the early warning of the sensor system. This benefit depends on the prediction time of the sensor monitoring system and the reaction time to execute the emergency measure. Additional costs for executing the emergency measure must be incorporated. The cost-benefit models have been worked out in case studies for dike-ring 48 and 14. Conclusion The conclusion of this research is that sensor monitoring can be implemented in the flood <b>safety,</b> by specifying <b>dike</b> reinforcements in both the periodic safety assessment, as well as the operational situation. However, the investments in sensor monitoring have to be made while a long waiting time is expected before benefits turn out. Then these benefits can financially be disappointing, but do have a certain value of information. Hydraulic Structures & Flood RiskHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Controversies in {{decision}} and policy-making processes can be analysed using frame reflection and mental model mapping techniques. The {{purpose of the}} method {{presented in this paper}} is {{to improve the quality of}} the information and interpretations available to decision makers, by surfacing and juxtaposing the different frames of decision makers, experts, and special interests groups. The research provides a new method to analyse frames. It defines a frame to consist of perspectives and a mental model, which are in close interaction (through second order learning processes). The mental model acts like a “filter” through which the problem situation is observed. Five major perspective types guide the construction of meaning out of the information delivered by the mental model, and determine what actors see as their interests. The perspective types are related to an actor's institutional and personal position in the decision making process. The method was applied to a case, in order to test its viability. The case concerns the decision making process and environmental impact assessment procedure for the improvement of dike ring 53 in the Netherlands, which was initiated by the Dutch “Flood Defences Act 1996 ”. In this specific case the perspectives and mental models of stakeholders were elicited to explain controversies. The case was analysed with regard to the conflicts emerging between stakeholders, on an individual level. The influence of institutional embedding of individuals on the use of information and the construction of meaning, and the limits of a participatory approach were analysed within the details of controversies that emerged during the case analysis. Complicating factor appeared to be the interaction between national <b>dike</b> <b>safety</b> norms (short term) and local water management problems (long term). Revealed controversies mainly concerned disputes between an organisational and a technical perspective. But also disputes on distribution of responsibilities between different institutes, on legal and political liability, and on funding issues, involving persons of both perspectives, were found. The case reveals a lack of possibilities to search for an integrated solution which involves all levels of authority, and a lack of possibilities to discuss the additional problems that were raised by the integrated approach in the initial phase of the case project. The complex and unstructured nature of the problem situation caused the traditional substantive approach to fail to deliver a good solution.

At this moment Vietnam is still fighting its way out of poverty and trying to improve living standards. With a coastline of 3, 260 kilometers many activities take place in the densely populated coastal areas. The government of Vietnam wants to use the coastal zone to its fullest potential and therefore a lot of economic development is planned in these regions. It is important to make the coastal zones safe areas for living and investments. The coastal areas of Vietnam are protected from the sea by dikes. Currently a major sea dike project investigates and upgrades the sea dikes and creates new dike construction guidelines. This project consists of several subprojects which each focus on a specific task. Subproject 4 reviews the sea dikes from Quang Ninh to Quang Nam provinces (Northern coastal provinces). The subproject 4 contents are the collection of data on sea dikes, the creation of a sea dike databank, the determination of the dike route and to set up design criteria for sea dikes. Within subproject 4 the Safety Standards project was set up focused on a plan of approach to define sea <b>dike</b> <b>safety</b> standards with a risk-based approach. Design criteria and guidelines for the construction of sea dikes are (part of) the output of subproject 4 and safety standards can form part of these design criteria. To determine these safety standards a risk assessment is executed. This is a different approach with respect to the current situation and also is a complicated subject. Introducing this new approach for the Vietnam situation the Safety Standards project is the first step in implementing this strategy for coastal defense projects. The introduction of this method in Vietnam is considered more important than finding the exact safety standards for different situations. Therefore the results of the Safety Standards project should be regarded as indicative, as an example. Translation of safety standards to technical design criteria is therefore outside the project scope. The Safety Standards project uses the coastal provinces Hai Phong and Nam Dinh as case study areas. Both provinces have approximately the same size and number of inhabitants, but different characteristics. Hai Phong is a more industrial province; Nam Dinh is a rural province. The research is focused on the Vietnamese situation and done from a Vietnamese perspective. With calculations based on economic optimalization an approach of defining safety standards was developed and three different safety standards for the Vietnamese sea dikes were found: 1. High safety level for high developed and fast developing areas; a safety standard of 1 / 1000 years can be considered for these areas. 2. Medium safety level for moderate populated areas with {{sustained economic growth}}; a safety standard of 1 / 200 years can be appropriate. 3. Low safety level for rural areas with no to little development; this can be a safety standard of 1 / 100 years. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Dutch flood protections are {{assessed}} every {{five to six}} years in a nationwide safety assessment round. During the last assessment round large dike stretches in the Dutch Wadden Sea could not meet the safety requirements, and were assessed with failure. Dike strengthening is therefore needed in these areas. However, in front of these dike salt marshes are present, which act as shallow foreshores. These could reduce the load in these dikes, {{which could lead to}} less or no dike strengthening. The dikes is assessed in the last official assessment round with a probabilistic program Hydra-NL. In this program the <b>safety</b> of a <b>dike</b> can determined {{on the basis of a}} dike profile and Hydraulic Boundary Conditions. The derivation of these conditions is done with the wave model SWAN. For the derivation of the hydraulic conditions a bottom profile is needed, in which the shallow foreshore are already included to some extent. Typically, the foreshores have already been included until 50 - 100 m in front of the dike toe. Here the hydraulic conditions have been given in a so called output point. In the program Hydra-NL a foreshore module is present. With this module the final stretch of foreshore can be taken into account. With this module the design conditions in the output point are taken and transformed to the location of the dike toe. This transformation leads to lower wave heights, which leads to lower loads on the dike. The calculation method used in the foreshore module of Hydra-NL is the ENDEC method. This module is first compared on theoretical basis to other available transformation methods as SWAN and DaF. This are all modules used in other official calculation tools. Outcome of the comparison was that the ENDEC module can, in some situations, give a significant deviation from the other modules. To determine the extent to which the effect of the foreshores have been included in the official safety assessment a different database of hydraulic conditions has been derived. Instead of near the dike, these conditions are defined at locations in front of the foreshore. These can therefore be seen as the deep water conditions. The effects of the foreshore {{are assessed}} on to failure mechanisms. A height assessment, using the maximum overtopping as criteria and a cover stability assessment, for which the wave height notably plays a big role. For the height assessment it was found that including the final foreshore stretch does not lead to a significant increase of the minimum required crest height. The assessment on the dike cover however shows that including the last part of the foreshore could lead to a substantial reduction of wave load. Particularly the lower dike parts experience lower wave loading. As most of the dike stretches in the Wadden Sea have failed on the cover slope of the outer dike, including the foreshore in this manner could lead to a reduction of failure probability.

On the other hand summers will be drier, putting the satisfaction of water demand in danger. Research approach and research question The goal of the research is to define for the IJsselmeer a dynamic target water level which is variable through the whole year by means of an optimization approach. The optimization uses a single objective function considering <b>dikes</b> <b>safety</b> and water demand. Such approach has been chosen because follows a different path than the ones mainly used so far to tackle the issue. When management measures alone are not enough to define a climate-proof IJsselmeer, extra measures are taken into consideration: a pumping station at the Afsluitdijk and early storage in March. The main research question asks for an evaluation of the optimization methodology used to define efficient alternatives for the IJsselmeer. The sub-question requires the assessment of the flexibility of the IJsselmeer towards a climate-proof system, and the definition of extra measures, when needed. Methodology The definition of the optimum measures is achieved in several steps. Firstly the objective of the problem owner is defined. The Dienst IJsselmeergebied is the only problem owner. Its interests are safety and water demand satisfaction. Then indicators are derived from the objectives, and merged into the objective function. Classes of measures are selected, and a model of the system designed for their evaluation. Finally the optimization problems are defined in order to design the optimum alternatives. Results A different planning of the target water level alone is not able to satisfy the needs of safety and water demand on the long term. As it is now, the IJsselmeer is flexible on the short term, but not enough to accommodate the impacts of longer horizons: extra measures are needed in order to define a climate proof system in 2050 and 2100. Pumping station at the Afsluitijk is an effective measure to guarantee safety for all the scenarios. Early storage in March is effective in the medium horizon (2050) but need high target water levels along the summer for the long term (2100). This might generate safety issues. Even if applied on a simplified case, the use of an optimization methodology manages to define a realistic picture of the flexibility of the IJsselmeer, and retrieves efficient options for possible future strategies. For this reasons, the present research can be considered a successful implementation of an optimization approach for the IJsselmeer. Conclusions and recommendations For the short term it is recommended to use the flexibility of the system, implementing the changes in summer target water levels which would allow deeper satisfaction of water demand. For the medium/long term, options for early storage need to be investigated together with the summer target water levels needed. This would probably require reinforcement of the <b>dikes.</b> Options for <b>safety</b> can be then defined for the new reinforced system, considering combinations of pumping station and raise of the dikes. A more extensive and detailed optimization tool should be realized for the IJsselmeer, and applied for the definition of the measures above. In particular it is recommended to use a multi-objective analysis and include costs in the definition of the indicators. Water ResourcesWatermanagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|On a {{daily basis}} we (in) {{directly}} make use of functions of various infrastructures: we drive on roads and bridges or we live without worries behind the <b>safety</b> of a <b>dike.</b> Only when there are cracks in the dike or a particular bridge is not accessible due to for example a broken pillar, we realize how critical these infrastructures are for our society and economy. These infrastructures are not build to last forever and they are susceptible to breakdowns, especially as some are reaching {{the end of their}} technical lifespan. Building new infrastructures is simply not an option, as this is often financially and logistically not feasible. Getting as much as possible out of the remaining technical lifespan of such critical infrastructures is then down to employing innovative maintenance strategies, such as risk and opportunity based asset management, as is being done in the ROBAMCI project, initiated by Deltares. Management and maintenance of infrastructures already takes place in a multi-actor environment. Adding systematic approaches on top of this multi-actor environment requires maintenance managers to further integrate their decision making processes. However, analysis have shown that there is a clear lack of this integrated decision making. Literature has further shown that this could be {{as a result of a}} lack of information sharing between organizations. Improving inter-organizational information sharing, however first requires further understandings. This research project is done with the goal to achieve that understanding. A case-study in the context of ROBAMCI was used to study this concpt in a practical environment. The asset in this case was a sea-lock complex located in Delfzijl, which not only performs functions for shipping, but also has various other direct and indirect functions, influencing for example local nature, economy and regional water management. Theoretical knowledge, gained from literature studies, was then used to interpret the data from in-depth interviews with employees of identified organizations. The empirical findings, interpreted through various sources of literature showed that there is a wide array of factors influencing inter-organizational information sharing in the case-study. Among the most mentioned and expected were trust, competing interests/self-interests and legislations & policies. Organizations also add value to the importance of personal physical interactions and even though the information sharing takes place between actors of one national government, concern for information misuse is also seen as a potential barrier for information sharing. The data has also led to the formation of some factor-relations, we see e. g. that trust forms a positive causal relation with not only information sharing itself, but also has a negative causal relation with concerns of the quality of the information. Data also makes it clear that there is an interrelation between the 3 levels of information sharing. These findings, backed by theory have led to the identification of 2 general fundamentals that can be taken into account when trying to further understand information sharing. The first one focuses on trust and legislations, whereas the second one addresses on the embeddedness of the information sharing levels. Conclusively it can be said that inter-organizational information sharing helps to make more efficient and effective decisions for the management and maintenance of assets. There are many factors that can either positively or negatively influence information sharing. It is recommended that through further studying factor relations their importance can be determined. This can also help to reduce the high number of factors and frameworks. For ROBAMCI it is recommended to use the results of this research as input for a maturity analysis focusing on the inter-organizational information management of organizations in the sector.

40|$|In the Netherlands flood {{risks are}} often {{assessed}} {{by using a}} dike ring approach. This approach has, aside from many advantages, also some disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that, when zooming in on a small area, {{the effect of the}} system on that small area and vice versa, is or cannot be accounted for properly. Research has shown that for a set of cases in the Netherlands these effects, called ‘load interdependencies’, have significant influence on flood risk estimates. Load interdependencies of flood defences are the effects of failures of dikes on load conditions of other dikes in the system. These can be both positive and negative; a failure causing a lower load at another locations is called positive, a failure causing a higher load at another location is called negative. The positive effects are caused by a decrease in discharge due to outflow into polders, the negative effects are generally caused by overland flow to another river, called shortcutting. In those cases flow and thus water levels increase, causing higher than expected water levels. To be able to assess these load interdependencies in flood risk analysis a different method is needed, as previous research shows and concludes that these effects cannot be ignored. Therefore the objective of this thesis was to develop a new method capable of dealing with these effects for cases at lowland rivers. Based upon previous research a new method was defined based upon a fast inundation model consisting of 1 D branches and storage reservoirs. Without losing too much accuracy, this model was 150 times faster than a similar 2 D model. Due to the fast nature of this model it was possible to execute a Monte Carlo analysis for the case of the Bovenrijn/IJssel, one of the cases in the Netherlands where load interdependencies have a significant influence on the outcome of risk analysis. By applying Importance Sampling techniques it was possible to execute the Monte Carlo analysis with a reduced number of runs. For the case of the Bovenrijn/IJssel, a schematization with 22 breach locations was used. By using the new method, it appeared that negative load interdependencies can indeed increase water levels at the IJssel, and it is thus necessary to account for these effects in further flood risk analysis. However, not at all locations at the IJssel negative effects are dominating; breaches along the IJssel compensate the negative effect. Along the Bovenrijn {{it was found that the}} effects are mainly positive. From the risk calculations it was shown that the risk at the left bank and the dike ring areas further downstream is mainly caused by negative load interdependencies. Other observations were that, although the flood waves are lower, they are also much longer, causing higher load durations. The water levels observed for the different discharge exceedence probabilities are generally much lower, which means that the actual <b>safety</b> of the <b>dikes</b> in the area is also generally higher. They also show a spreading for each discharge, meaning that the water levels are influenced by the uncertainty in strength of other dikes. From the case study it was concluded that the methodology performed quite well and gave interesting insights in the effects of load interdependencies in the area. However, this knowledge should not be used in all cases. For dike design for instance, it is not feasible to account for positive effects, as one dike reinforcement project would change the safety level of all other dikes. However, for calculations of the Maximum Probable Damage and for prioritization of dike reinforcement projects, accounting for load interdependencies can give a huge advantage.

40|$|A {{hot topic}} in the Netherlands is the <b>safety</b> {{reassessment}} of <b>dikes.</b> Currently several (river) dikes are being reinforced to withstand a given normative high water level. The environment of those dikes is often characterised by small floodplains and urban areas {{right next to the}} dike, wherefore standard geo-technical measures cannot be applied. Installing a diaphragm wall in the crest of the dike is in such a case a measure that can guarantee the safety, by preventing the development of a shear plane when the dike is subjected to a normative high water level. In engineering practice modelling of those structures is simplified by using a linear elastic plate element with a reduced stiffness, to account for concrete cracking upon loading, or a linear elastic-perfectly plastic volume element in the geotechnical finite element code Plaxis. In this master thesis attention will be paid to the possibility of modelling and designing such (geotechnical) reinforced concrete structures in Plaxis more accurately {{with the use of a}} new concrete material model. Recently the Shotcrete material model for volume elements is released by Plaxis. The Shotcrete material model accounts for non-linear and time dependent behaviour, i. e. more realistic behaviour, of concrete. The material model is however only been used for modelling unreinforced shotcrete in a NATM application. The capabilities of using the Shotcrete material model to design laterally loaded reinforced concrete structures in the subsurface is investigated. At first the theoretical applicability of the Shotcrete material model to design reinforced concrete structures in Plaxis 2 D is being researched. Verification against guidelines and model codes for describing concrete behaviour showed that the material model has the prospect to model non-linear concrete material behaviour, including cracking, realistically. By means of analysing a statically determined reinforced concrete bending beam model it is found that using a by elastoplastic plate element(s) reinforced Shotcrete volume element has additional value over the use of a linear elastic and a linear elastic-perfectly plastic material model when modelling a reinforced concrete structure. Nevertheless it is observed that the results given by the Shotcrete model are slightly mesh sensitive. The use of a by elastoplastic plate element(s) reinforced Shotcrete volume element is subsequently verified by comparing the results to commonly for design used M-kappa and M-N-kappa hand calculations. It is demonstrated that in case the reinforced concrete structure is subjected to bending, as well as a normal force, the model gives accurate and realistic results. Deviations can be explained by differences in calculation method, hand calculation versus numerical model. When the structure is subjected to a normal force attention has to be paid to pre-stressing of the reinforcement and the resulting stresses in the concrete. An elastoplastic plate reinforced Shotcrete volume element is used to model a diaphragm wall next to an excavation. Evaluation of an excavation next to a diaphragm wall, such that structural bending failure is the normative failure mode, showed that using an elastoplastic plate reinforced Shotcrete volume element gives improved results with respect to commonly used modelling methods. The other used modelling methods are a linear elastic, respectively equivalent to the reinforced diaphragm wall M-kappa, plate element and a linear elastic volume element. A lower bending moment is obtained in the structure at the same deformation, which is partly the effect of higher (soil-structure) interface shear stresses. During the analysis it is found that obtaining the correct bending moment in the structure is not straightforward. It is found that only by taking an internal force equilibrium at the neutral line in the normative cross-section of the diaphragm wall the correct bending moment can be obtained. Applying the model in the Kinderdijk-Schoonhovenseveer (KIS) dike reinforcement project demonstrates the advantage of applying a more realistic, nevertheless more complex, way of modelling reinforced concrete structures in Plaxis 2 D. The obtained bending moment in the structure increases with 25 % in SLS and decreases with 10 % in ULS with respect to modelling the diaphragm wall by means of a linear elastic plate element with a reduced stiffness, to account for cracking. To conclude, a stepwise approach is proposed to model a laterally loaded reinforced concrete structure in the subsurface realistically, by means of implementing a by elastoplastic plate elements reinforced Shotcrete volume element.
