500|$|Asked in a 2003 {{interview}} about his most enduring achievement {{as president of}} the FIA, Mosley replied: [...] "I think using Formula One to push ENCAP Crash-Testing." [...] The European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) is a European car safety performance assessment programme that originated with work done by the Transport Research Laboratory for the UK Department for Transport. The FIA became involved in the programme in 1996, taking a lead in promoting it, and Mosley chaired the body from its launch as Euro NCAP in 1997 to 2004. Despite what NCAP describes as a [...] "strong negative response" [...] from car manufacturers at first, the initiative has expanded, and NCAP says {{that there has been a}} clear increase in the safety of modern cars as a result. The EU commission in 2000 stated that [...] "EuroNCAP had become the single most important mechanism for achieving advances in vehicle safety" [...] and [...] "the most cost effective road <b>safety</b> <b>action</b> available to the EU." [...] Mosley has continued to promote the matter through his membership of initiatives such as CARS 21, the European Commission’s policy group aimed at improving the worldwide competitiveness of the European automotive industry.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} analyzed 523 {{accidents in}} the R. O. C. Air Force between 1978 and 2002 using the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) framework described by Wiegmann & Shappell (2003). This study provides an understanding, based upon empirical evidence, of how actions and decisions {{at higher levels}} in the organization to result in operational errors and accidents. Suggestions are made about intervention strategies focusing on the categories at higher levels of HFACS. Specific targets for remedial <b>safety</b> <b>actions</b> should be aimed in the areas that share the strongest and greatest number of significant associations with ‘Organizational Influences’ (for example, ‘organizational process’, ‘inadequate supervision’ and ‘Crew Resource Management’).

40|$|Today CERN's {{facilities}} {{are equipped with}} automatic smoke and gas detection systems. Upon smoke or gas leak detection, local <b>safety</b> <b>actions</b> are automatically performed and alarms indicating the location and type of danger are transmitted to the CERN Fire Brigade. The firefighters then size their intervention {{based on the information}} received. The increasing complexity, size and quantity of CERN installations drives safety systems to evolve in the direction of simplicity. Intuitive interfaces are required to cope with high turnover of firefighters, and the inherent multinational environment. Global overview of alarms and <b>safety</b> <b>actions</b> statuses are needed by firefighters to decide on the best strategy for intervention. In some emergency situations, it might be necessary to manually trigger remote actions. CERN is studying a new concept, inspired by French standards, where the detection and protection layers are separated and act independently, but provide a common interface.

50|$|The {{attempted}} {{launch of}} an Explorer satellite on July 16 failed dramatically when the Juno II lost control almost immediately at liftoff, performing a cartwheel before the Range Safety officer sent the destruct command. The almost fully fueled booster crashed {{a few hundred}} feet from the pad, blockhouse crews watching in stunned surprise at the upper stage motors burning on the ground. Cause of the mishap was quickly traced to a short between two diodes in a power inverter, which cut off power to the guidance system at liftoff and caused the Juno's engine to gimbal to full stop, flipping the vehicle onto its side before Range <b>Safety</b> <b>action</b> was taken. To prevent a recurrence of this failure mode, improved coatings were used on the circuit boards in the booster.|$|E

40|$|Construction {{organizations}} {{are large and}} complex with decentralized structures, and characterized by non-routine work undertaken by semi-autonomous work groups. Construction workers&# 039; perceptions of safety climate can form at different levels and vary between subunits. A multilevel safety climate measurement tool was proposed, which identified five important safety agents, i. e. client, principal contractor, supervisor, co-workers, and individual workers. Surveys were conducted at three construction projects commissioned by Fonterra Co-operative Group. A total of 356 participants completed the survey. The data was subject to scale reliability analysis and factor analysis. The results showed that all scales achieved satisfactory internal consistency and the multilevel factorial structure was generally supported. At the organizational level, the tool measures clients&# 039; overall safety priority and <b>safety</b> <b>actions,</b> and principal contractors&# 039; general commitment to safety. At the group level, the tool measures supervisors&# 039; <b>safety</b> <b>actions</b> and <b>safety</b> expectations, and co-workers&# 039; general safety values and practices.

50|$|Knowing {{that several}} Standard Operating Procedures were {{violated}} in Flight 222, especially descending below the Minimum Descent Altitude, investigators {{then tried to}} identify if the problems came from TransAsia Airways itself. Shockingly, interviews {{with some of the}} pilots of TransAsia Airways found that routine violations from the Standard Operating Procedure were normal. In particular, the flight crew were known to descend below the minimum before acquiring the required visual references. However, the Taiwanese AIC had known of this routine violations in TransAsia Airways before, as they had already investigated an incidents involving TransAsia Airways before Flight 222. In response to the previous investigation, the airline implemented several <b>safety</b> <b>actions</b> to eliminate Standard Operating Procedures violations. However, the <b>safety</b> <b>actions</b> implemented by TransAsia Airways were inadequate and ineffective, thus Standard Operating Procedures violations remained as usual. While there was a supervisor for the Standards and Training Section, the high flight times and instructional workload of the check and training pilots assigned to assist him was such that they had insufficient time available to perform support tasks such as reviewing Standard Operating Procedure training, audits, and operational safety risk assessments. In addition, the shortage of standards pilots may have been another reason why the Standard Operating Procedure were not as effective as they could have been.|$|R
