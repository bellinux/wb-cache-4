5|$|The {{inauguration of}} Ronald Reagan as {{president}} in 1981, ushered in an eight-year period of conservative {{leadership in the}} U.S. government. Under his leadership, the government pushed a conservative <b>social</b> <b>agenda,</b> including outlawing abortion, inserting prayer in schools, banning pornography, and resisting gay rights.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have since}} {{connected}} {{the success of}} Save Our Children with the organization of conservative Christian participation in political processes. Although forceful Christian involvement had not taken a widespread role in politics in the United States since 1925, within two years the Reverend Jerry Falwell developed a coalition of conservative religious groups named the Moral Majority that influenced the Republican Party to incorporate a <b>social</b> <b>agenda</b> in national politics. Homosexuality, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), abortion, and pornography were among the issues most central to the Moral Majority's priorities until it folded in 1989. For many gay people, the surprise at the outcome of all the campaigns in 1977 and 1978 instilled a new determination and consolidated activism and communities in many cities where the gay community had not been politically active.|$|E
5|$|Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election, {{which gave}} the party a {{majority}} in the Lok Sabha, the first time a single party had achieved this since 1984. Modi himself was elected to parliament from Varanasi. Since taking office, Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy, increased spending on infrastructure, and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy, and centralised power through the abolition of the planning commission. He has begun a high-profile sanitation campaign, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. Credited with engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary <b>social</b> <b>agenda.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Human {{computation}} {{includes the}} accumulation of social wisdom {{in the form of}} progressive <b>social</b> <b>agendas.</b> These agendas developed rapidly during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries through the distributed intelligence made possible by advanced information technologies. Progressive <b>social</b> <b>agendas</b> build toward equality among groups differentiated by race, class, gender, sexual orientation, and similar factors. It is no accident that these trends, distinctive in human history, occurred during an era in which national and international communication and the creation and widespread dispersal of information were enabled by advanced technologies. In this chapter I discuss future threats to social progress and the importance of maintaining the information and communication technologies and infrastructures that underpin such progress...|$|R

40|$|Looking {{back over}} the past 20 years of my practice, the vista is {{littered}} with ambiguities of process and form within socially engaged performance. Sifting through the debris, one question arises: what have I been doing?; another might be: what have I been making? What feels relevant {{to me is the}} aggregate of my experiences; the who I am. With the current sector creep towards instrumentalising arts for <b>social</b> <b>agendas,</b> the value and relevance of experience ebbs. Demands on artists extend well beyond aesthetic skill, process facilitation and project management. In this essay, I critique the risk within socially engaged practice of art becoming subservient to <b>social</b> <b>agendas</b> and consider how the shift towards an uber-artist construct renders the sector unsustainable...|$|R

25|$|The title, without {{needing to}} {{actually}} include Charteris, {{allows for the}} play {{to serve as a}} critique of abuses of power and immorality. Justice Squeezum represents the flaws of society, while Justice Worthy represents England as it tries to deal with the various problems. The play serves as a way for Fielding to express his own views about society in his comedy. Fielding furthered this end by using Aristophanes as a model, and the theatre became his means to encouraging social change. However, the play is still a comedy, and the <b>social</b> <b>agenda</b> stands besides romantic intrigue and traditional comedic situations. There is an emphasis on legal matters, and the final words deal with crime. As such, the theatre serves as a kind of courtroom, and the characters are judged throughout the play with Fielding serving as a sort of prosecutor.|$|E
25|$|In America, mask-work was {{slower to}} arrive, but the Guerrilla Theatre movement, typified by {{groups such as}} the San Francisco Mime Troupe and Bread and Puppet Theatre took {{advantage}} of it. Influenced by modern dance, modern mime, Commedia dell'arte and Brecht such groups took to the streets to perform highly political theatre. Peter Schumann, the founder of Bread and Puppet theatre, made particular use of German Carnival masks. Bread and Puppet inspired other practitioners around the world, many of whom used masks in their work. In the US and Canada, these companies include In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theater of Minneapolis; Arm-of-the Sea Theatre from New York State; Snake Theater from California; and Shadowland Theatre of Toronto. These companies, and others, have a strong <b>social</b> <b>agenda,</b> and combine masks, music and puppetry to create a visual theatrical form. Another route masks took into American Theatre was via dancer/choreographers such as Mary Wigman, who had been using masks in dance and had emigrated to America to flee the Nazi regime.|$|E

500|$|The {{nomination}} of Modi for the prime ministership {{drew attention to}} his reputation as [...] "one of contemporary India's most controversial and divisive politicians." [...] During the 2014 election campaign the BJP projected an image of Modi as a strong, masculine leader, who {{would be able to}} take difficult decisions. Campaigns in which he has participated have focused on Modi as an individual, in a manner unusual for the BJP and RSS. Modi has relied upon his reputation as a politician able to bring about economic growth and [...] "development". Nonetheless, his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots continues to attract criticism and controversy. Modi's hardline Hindutva philosophy and the policies adopted by his government continue to draw criticism, and have been seen as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary <b>social</b> <b>agenda.</b>|$|E
500|$|Roark {{is opposed}} {{by what he}} calls [...] "second-handers", who value {{conformity}} over independence and integrity. These include Roark's former classmate, Peter Keating, who succeeds by following popular styles, but turns to Roark for help with design problems. Ellsworth Toohey, a socialist architecture critic who uses his influence to promote his political and <b>social</b> <b>agenda,</b> tries to destroy Roark's career. Tabloid newspaper publisher Gail Wynand seeks to shape popular opinion; he befriends Roark, then betrays him when public opinion turns in a direction he cannot control. The novel's most controversial character is Roark's lover, Dominique Francon. She believes that non-conformity has no chance of winning, so she alternates between helping Roark and working to undermine him. Feminist critics have condemned Roark and Dominique's first sexual encounter, accusing Rand of endorsing rape.|$|E
500|$|For Shelley, biographical {{writing was}} {{supposed}} to, in her words, [...] "form {{as it were}} a school in which to study the philosophy of history", and to teach [...] "lessons". Most frequently and importantly, these lessons consisted of criticisms of male-dominated institutions such as primogeniture. Shelley emphasises domesticity, romance, family, sympathy, and compassion {{in the lives of}} her subjects. Her conviction that such forces could improve society connects her biographical approach with that of other early feminist historians such as Mary Hays and Anna Jameson. Unlike her novels, most of which had an original print run of several hundred copies, the Lives had a print run of about 4,000 for each volume: thus, according to Kucich, Mary Shelley's [...] "use of biography to forward the <b>social</b> <b>agenda</b> of women's historiography became one of her most influential political interventions".|$|E

500|$|Belyayev {{was one of}} {{a growing}} number of Russian nouveau-riche {{industrialists}} who became patrons of the arts in mid- to late-19th-century Russia; their number included Nadezhda von Meck, railway magnate Savva Mamontov and textile manufacturer Pavel Tretyakov. While Nadezhda von Meck insisted on anonymity in her patronage in the tradition of noblesse oblige, Belyayev, Mamontov and Tretyakov [...] "wanted to contribute conspicuously to public life". They had worked their way up into wealth, and being Slavophilic in their national outlook believed in the greater glory of Russia. Because of this belief, they were more likely than the aristocracy to support native talent, and were more inclined to support nationalist artists over cosmopolitan ones. This preference was not due to any <b>social</b> <b>agenda</b> inherent in the art, but due to [...] "its sympathetic and skillful portrayal of peculiar aspects of landscape, of daily life, and of character types with which they were familiar and which they lived", and it paralleled a general upsurge in nationalism and Russophilia that became prevalent in mainstream Russian art and society.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 1495 some Scots were {{in contact with}} the leading figure in the {{northern}} humanist movement, the Netherlands-born Desiderius Erasmus (1466–1536). They were also {{in contact with the}} French humanist and scholar Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples (c. 1455–1536). Erasmus was tutor to James VI's illegitimate son, and Archbishop of St. Andrews, Alexander Stewart (c. 1493–1513). These international contacts helped integrate Scotland into a wider European scholarly world and {{would be one of the}} most important ways in which the new ideas of humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life. By 1497 the humanist and historian Hector Boece, born in Dundee and who had studied at Paris, returned to become the first principal at the new university of Aberdeen. The continued movement to other universities produced a school of Scottish nominalists at Paris in the early sixteenth century, the most important of whom was John Mair, generally described as a scholastic, but whose Latin History of Greater Britain (1521) was sympathetic to the humanist <b>social</b> <b>agenda.</b> Another major figure was Archibald Whitelaw, who taught at St. Andrews and Cologne, becoming a tutor to the young James III and royal secretary from 1462–93. Robert Reid, Abbot of Kinloss and later Bishop of Orkney, was responsible in the 1520s and 1530s for bringing the Italian humanist Giovanni Ferrario to teach at Kinloss Abbey, where he established an impressive library and wrote works of Scottish history and biography. Reid was also instrumental in organising the public lectures which were established in Edinburgh in the 1540s on law, Greek, Latin and philosophy, under the patronage of Mary of Guise. They developed into the [...] "Tounis College", which would become the University of Edinburgh in 1582.|$|E
