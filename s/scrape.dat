We aim {{to study}} the {{therapeutic}} effects of <b>scraping</b> by investigating the changes of temperature and local blood perfusion volume in healthy subjects after <b>scraping</b> stimulation, and to explore the mechanism of <b>scraping</b> stimulation from the points of microcirculation and energy metabolism.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{increasing}} presence of Semantic Web Facilities, only {{a limited amount of}} the available resources in the Internet provide a semantic access. Recent initiatives such as the emerging Linked Data Web are providing semantic access to available data by porting existing resources to the semantic web using different technologies, such as database-semantic mapping and <b>scraping.</b> Nevertheless, existing <b>scraping</b> solutions are based on ad-hoc solutions complemented with graphical interfaces for speeding up the scraper development. This article proposes a generic framework for web <b>scraping</b> based on semantic technologies. This framework is structured in three levels: <b>scraping</b> services, semantic <b>scraping</b> model and syntactic <b>scraping.</b> The ﬁrst level provides an interface to generic applications or intelligent agents for gathering information from the web at a high level.

5|$|Like most cats, the jaguar is solitary outside mother–cub groups. Adults {{generally}} meet only {{to court}} and mate (though limited noncourting socialization has been observed anecdotally) and carve out large territories for themselves. Female territories, which range from 25 to 40km2 in size, may overlap, but the animals generally avoid one another. Male ranges cover roughly twice as much area, varying in size with the availability of game and space, and do not overlap. The territory of a male can contain those of several females. The jaguar uses <b>scrape</b> marks, urine, and feces to mark its territory.|$|E

40|$|<b>Scraping</b> and {{excavating}} parrotfishes {{are well}} known for their marked differences in jaw morphology and feeding behaviour. Despite the importance of parrotfishes to reef systems and the well-known differences within the group, few studies have compared the functional importance of <b>scraping</b> versus excavating parrotfishes in shaping coral reef benthic communities. We compared the abundance, depth and dynamics of <b>scraping</b> and excavating parrotfish grazing scars on massive Porites spp. colonies along a reef gradient at Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef. <b>Scraping</b> grazing scars were more abundant at most study sites than excavating scars. Excavating grazing scars were relatively rare but exposed more coral skeleton than <b>scraping</b> scars. Approximately 70 % of excavating scars had some degree of filamentous algal growth in the scar compared with just 5 % of <b>scraping</b> scars. <b>Scraping</b> grazing scars on massive Porites spp. completely disappeared after 2 mo whereas excavating grazing scars remained almost unchanged over this period. Groups of excavating scars were more tightly clustered, exposed more coral skeleton and presented higher algal cover than grouped <b>scraping</b> scars. The deep, long-lasting excavating scars probably provide more suitable sites for the settlement of benthic algae and other invasive taxa on coral colonies. In contrast, the abundant and frequent grazing scars of <b>scraping</b> parrotfish may represent a more constant drain on energy supplies for coral colonies. These results highlight the differences between parrotfishes with distinct feeding modes and indicate that they differently impact not only algal communities but also coral colonies...|$|R

5|$|Bird {{eggs are}} usually laid in a nest. Most species create {{somewhat}} elaborate nests, {{which can be}} cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows. Some bird nests, however, are extremely primitive; albatross nests {{are no more than}} a <b>scrape</b> on the ground. Most birds build nests in sheltered, hidden areas to avoid predation, but large or colonial birds—which are more capable of defence—may build more open nests. During nest construction, some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite-reducing toxins to improve chick survival, and feathers are often used for nest insulation. Some bird species have no nests; the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet. The absence of nests is especially prevalent in ground-nesting species where the newly hatched young are precocial.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying (ovipositing) {{involves}} {{not only}} the female darting over floating or waterside vegetation to deposit eggs on a suitable substrate, but also the male hovering above her or continuing to clasp her and flying in tandem. The male attempts to prevent rivals from removing his sperm and inserting their own, something made possible by delayed fertilisation and driven by sexual selection. If successful, a rival male uses his penis to compress or <b>scrape</b> out the sperm inserted previously; this activity takes up {{much of the time}} that a copulating pair remains in the heart posture. Flying in tandem has the advantage that less effort is needed by the female for flight and more can be expended on egg-laying, and when the female submerges to deposit eggs, the male may help to pull her out of the water.|$|E

5|$|Nesting {{takes place}} in loose colonies, the nest a <b>scrape</b> found on a cliff face that is easy to take off from. A single egg is laid, being {{incubated}} by both sexes for about six weeks. Whether the egg hatches or not can be influenced by pollution and weather, although the latter has a minimal effect on whether a chick fledges or not. After a chick fledges, the parents will usually stop visiting the nest and the chick will leave. Birds of all ages feed on fish and squid, catching them by diving from the air into the water. However, the red-billed tropicbird sometimes follows surface-feeding predators. The predators will drive the prey to the surface, which are then seized by the tropicbird.|$|E
