25|$|Hydrogen sulfide is {{a highly}} toxic and {{flammable}} gas (flammable range: 4.3–46%). Being heavier than air, it tends to accumulate {{at the bottom of}} poorly ventilated spaces. Although very pungent at first, it quickly deadens the sense of smell, so victims may be unaware of its presence until it is too late. For safe handling procedures, a hydrogen sulfide <b>safety</b> <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> (SDS) should be consulted.|$|E
25|$|The <b>safety</b> <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> for {{unleaded}} gasoline shows at least 15 hazardous chemicals occurring in various amounts, including benzene (up to 5% by volume), toluene (up to 35% by volume), naphthalene (up to 1% by volume), trimethylbenzene (up to 7% by volume), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (up to 18% by volume, in some states) and about ten others. Hydrocarbons in gasoline generally exhibit low acute toxicities, with LD50 of 700–2700mg/kg for simple aromatic compounds. Benzene and many antiknocking additives are carcinogenic.|$|E
25|$|In November 2008, {{traces of}} {{melamine}} {{were reported to}} have been found by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in infant formula sold in the United States made by the three main American firms — Abbott Laboratories, Nestlé and Mead Johnson — responsible for 90–99% of the infant formula market in that country. The levels were much less than those reported in China, where levels of melamine contamination had reached as much as 2,500 parts per million, about 10,000 times higher than the recorded US levels. The <b>safety</b> <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> for melamine (CAS registry number 108-78-1; C3-H6-N6) recorded the acute oral toxicity (median lethal dose) at 3161mg/kg for a rat.|$|E
40|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Sheets</b> are {{the primary}} source of hazard {{information}} on chemical substances and mixtures and are used to inform risk assessments. It is imperative to ascertain the quality of this primary source of information in informing risk based decision making. The content of <b>Safety</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Sheets</b> (SDS) is governed by regulatory requirements outlined under the Globally Harmonised System for the Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). However, regulation in itself does not provide assurance {{of the quality of the}} content of the SDS. This study assesses and creates an awareness of the quality of <b>Safety</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Sheets</b> and establishes the criteria for ranking the quality of various sections in the SDS. 200 <b>Safety</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Sheets</b> have been selected from the aerospace sector and assessed for their quality. A review of the 200 SDS has identified significant statistical differences between the various sections of the SDS and the quality of information between hazardous and non-hazardous chemicals. The data analysis suggests a limited impact of GHS and REACH, Annex II Regulations on the overall quality of content of the <b>Safety</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Sheets...</b>|$|R
