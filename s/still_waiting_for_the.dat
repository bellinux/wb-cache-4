25|$|The {{moment of}} epiphany comes {{late in the}} play. At the {{beginning}} of Scene III, Oedipus is <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> servant to {{be brought into the}} city, when a messenger arrives from Corinth to declare that King Polybus of Corinth is dead. Oedipus, when he hears this news, feels much relieved, because he believed that Polybus was the father whom the oracle had destined him to murder, and he momentarily believes himself to have escaped fate. He tells this all to the present company, including the messenger, but the messenger knows that it is not true. He is the man who found Oedipus as a baby in the pass of Cithaeron and gave him to King Polybus to raise. He reveals, furthermore that the servant who is being brought to the city as they speak is the very same man who took Oedipus up into the mountains as a baby. Jocasta realizes now all that has happened. She begs Oedipus not to pursue the matter further. He refuses, and she withdraws into the palace as the servant is arriving. The old man arrives, and it is clear at once that he knows everything. At the behest of Oedipus, he tells it all.|$|E
25|$|Other {{reforms were}} of a more {{imitative}} nature. The reason for the lightning advance of the French army was its great superiority in numbers. An army of 125,000 French faced a Dutch field army of only 22,000. The difference in the total strengths of the two armies was not as large, as the Dutch had managed to double {{the size of the}} States Army from its peace-time strength of about 35,000 to about 80,000 in early 1672 through frantic recruitment efforts. Most of these additional troops garrisoned the many Dutch fortresses, however, which subsequently often surrendered without a fight to the French, or were simply bypassed. In any case, 22,000 was about the maximum the Dutch could support logistically in the field. The reason why the French were able to support a far larger field army was that they had developed a superior logistical system in the recent War of Devolution. Previous armies of large size, like the combined Franco-Dutch army of 50,000 that invaded the Spanish Netherlands in 1635 and subsequently almost starved, simply could not manage the strain of supplying the daily bread of the soldiers. The French Secretary of State for War Louvois had developed a system of forward supply bases, well-stocked with fodder for the horses and bread grain for the soldiers {{before the start of the}} annual campaign season. This not only kept the French well fed during the campaign in hitherto unsustainable numbers, but also allowed Louis XIV to start his campaigns while his opponents were <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> grass to grow for their cavalry horses.|$|E

25|$|In 2015–16 season, Palermo {{started their}} season without Dybala after the youngster moved to Juventus; the Rosanero {{therefore}} relied on senior striker Alberto Gilardino {{to play as}} a partner of Vázquez. On 10 November 2015, coach Giuseppe Iachini was sacked due to disappointing results {{in the beginning of}} the season; he was replaced by Davide Ballardini. Ballardini only lasted for 7 matches with Palermo before fired by Zamparini after spectacularly falling out with Palermo's players. Palermo captain Stefano Sorrentino reported that during 1–0 victory against Hellas Verona, the coach did not speak to Palermo players neither before nor after the match. Fabio Viviani became Palermo's caretaker manager in a 0–4 defeat against Genoa. Rosanero hired Guillermo Barros Schelotto as a new manager. Schelotto, however, did not have the necessary paperwork to be registered as Palermo coach, so his position was taken by Primavera youth team coach Giovanni Bosi during a 4–1 win over Udinese. Schelotto was registered as a team manager during that match. Giovanni Tedesco named as Palermo's sixth coach of the season while Schelotto is <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> paperwork. On 10 February 2016, following Schelotto's resignation after UEFA refusal to hand him a valid European coaching authorization, Palermo announced to have promoted Primavera youth coach Giovanni Bosi as new head coach, with Tedesco as his technical collaborator. Five days later, Bosi was sacked, and Iachini was re-appointed as manager. On 10 March, Iachini was sacked once again, as Walter Novellino was appointed as his replacement. Novellino was then sacked on 11 April. Davide Ballardini was rehired a day later for the ninth managerial change that season. On 15 May, Palermo escaped relegation on the last day of the league with the necessary win over Hellas Verona 3–2, securing 16th place.|$|E

500|$|... "A Song for Simeon" [...] is not {{considered}} by scholars and critics {{to be one of}} Eliot's significant poems.

However, in [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] and these poems, Eliot continues the progression of his themes of alienation in a changing world, and fuses with this the tenets of his newfound faith. Scofield states that the imagery of [...] "A Song for Simeon"—including the symbol of a feather, its setting amid Roman hyacinths and the winter sun—conveys [...] "a sense of wonder and fragile new life". Robin Griffith-Jones draws a connection between Eliot's image of the feather to a statement by Hildegard of Bingen comparing herself [...] "to 'a feather which lacks all weight and strength and flies through the wind'; so she was borne up by God.
