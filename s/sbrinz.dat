50|$|<b>Sbrinz</b> is {{an extra}} hard full fat cheese. It {{contains}} approximately 40% to 45% of fat when dry. The cheese must ripen for 16 months {{before it can}} be sold as <b>Sbrinz,</b> and the full flavour only develops after about 24-30 months in storage.|$|E
50|$|Since 2001, <b>Sbrinz</b> is an {{appellation}} d'origine contrôlée (AOC). The AOC provides {{specifications for}} {{the origin of}} the milk and the processes that must be followed in order for the cheese to labeled as <b>Sbrinz.</b> In 2013, it was replaced by the appellation d'origine protégée (AOP) certification.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sbrinz</b> is {{commonly}} consumed in several ways; {{it can be}} used grated, such as on pasta. It can be eaten in small pieces, often to accompany wine. It is also eaten in thin slices planed from the hard cheese. <b>Sbrinz</b> is often simply enjoyed with bread and butter.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sbrinz</b> is a {{very hard}} cheese {{produced}} in central Switzerland. It is often used instead of Parmesan cheese in Swiss cuisine.The cheese is produced in only 42 dairies in central Switzerland. Only local cow's milk is used when producing this cheese. It is kept in the region until ready for consumption.Contrary to popular belief, the name <b>Sbrinz</b> does not originally refer to a particular place or region. Nevertheless, the Swiss Cheese Union added to this myth by launching an advertising campaign in the 1990s. As {{a result of this}} campaign, there is now an area called <b>Sbrinz.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sbrinz</b> {{is claimed}} to be the oldest European cheese. The Celtic {{ancestors}} of the Swiss were making cheese centuries before the recorded birth of Christ. [...] This cheese may have been an ancestor to modern <b>Sbrinz.</b> The official web site claims that the cheese was first mentioned in 70 AD, but does not give any details. Other sources claim that the cheese is mentioned in contracts dated around 1200. It seems certain, however, that it is mentioned in documents dating from 1530, which are kept in the state archive in Bern.|$|E
50|$|Berner Alpkäse is {{very similar}} to <b>Sbrinz</b> but the latter is {{produced}} in the lowlands and is much saltier, undergoing a longer brining period of 15 to 20 days.|$|E

5000|$|The Swiss Cheese Union (Schweizer Käseunion AG, [...] ) was a {{marketing}} and trading organization in Switzerland, which from 1914 to 1999 {{served as a}} cartel to control cheese production. To this end, the Swiss Cheese Union mandated production be limited to only 3 varieties: Gruyere, Emmental, and <b>Sbrinz,</b> and bought the entire production and distribution of cheese at prices set by the Swiss Federal Council. It also coordinated the national and international marketing for these three varieties of cheese.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} food safety {{agencies}} {{around the world have}} warned of the risks of raw-milk cheeses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration states that soft raw-milk cheeses can cause [...] "serious infectious diseases including listeriosis, brucellosis, salmonellosis and tuberculosis". It is U.S. law since 1944 that all raw-milk cheeses (including imports since 1951) must be aged at least 60 days. Australia has a wide ban on raw-milk cheeses as well, though in recent years exceptions have been made for Swiss Gruyère, Emmental and <b>Sbrinz,</b> and for French Roquefort. There is a trend for cheeses to be pasteurized even when not required by law.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sbrinz</b> and Tilsiter chee se is described. During {{the first}} five months of cheese ripening, the total amount of the free amino acids {{increases}} by 140 - 290 mg kg-I per day. Gruyère shows the highest increase for 15 amino acids, Appenzeller for valine, methionine, phenylalanine and ornithine, Raclette for Œ- and y-amino butyric acid, Emmentaler for alanine and <b>Sbrinz</b> for arginine. High quality cheese shows higher relative amounts of aspartic acid, asparagine and arginine and lower rel-ative amounts of glycine, alanine, valine, methionine and isoleucine. The significant differences for Emmentaler were reversed for asparagine, alanine and methionine...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- One {{hundred and}} thirty-five propionibacteria {{isolated}} from brown spots of Appenzell, Emmental, Raclette and <b>Sbrinz</b> cheese {{were analyzed by}} random amplified polymorphie deoxyri-bonucleic acid (RAPD) and protein profiling. Both Propionibacteriumfreudenreichii subsp. shennanii and P. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii seem {{to be involved in}} the formation ofbrown spots in ail these cheeses. In ail Appenzell cheeses, in addition to P. freudenreichii, slow-growing P. acidipro-pion ici and P. jensenii strains, which are known to cause brown spots, were found. A high proportion of unknown bacteria were noted in the brown spots of Raclette cheese. None of the isolated strains from Appenzell, Raclette and <b>Sbrinz</b> came from the commercial propionibacteria used in cheese production. Only one of the strains isolated was found in raw milk obtained from the same region where the cheese was produced. © Inra/Elsevier, Paris Propionibacterium / cheese / electrophoresis / PCR Résumé- Identification des bactéries propioniques dans les points bruns des fromages suisses à pâte dure et mi-dure.

40|$|Curd granule {{junction}} {{patterns in}} hard (Emmentaler, Gruyere, <b>Sbrinz)</b> and semi-hard cheeses (Appenzeller, Tilsiter, Raclette) were visualized on slices and examined using light microscopy and digital image analysis. Horizontal and vertical sections were cut in different zones of the loaves, {{in order to}} obtain information on the orientation of the flattened curd granules. The frequency histograms of the cross section areas could in most cases adequately be described as a log-normal distribution. The median values ranged from 0. 97 to 1. 15 mm 2 and, from 1. 31 to 1. 68 mm 2 for hard and semi-hard cheeses, respectively. An elliptical form factor was used as a measure of the deformation of the granules. The average ratio of the elliptical axes was in the range of 0. 41 to 0. 56 in horizontal and 0. 33 to 0. 48 i n vertical sections. The difference between the form factors in the orthogonal sections was less pronounced in the Appenzeller and Tilsiter cheeses than in the other varieties. Significantly different junction patterns were observed in regions of the edges and sides of the original billets of curd. The micrographs reveal ed interesting features around the eyes and in the cheese rind. Semi-mechanized and traditionally manufactured Appenzeller and Tilsiter cheeses had different curd granule junction patterns, mainly because of different moulding and pressing arrangements...|$|E
