Three equity measures were selected and incorporated into an accessibility-maximization road network design model. The three equity measures reflect different perspectives on equity: accessibility to low-accessibility centers, the dispersion of accessibility values across all centers (Gini coefficient), and the dispersion of accessibility values across all centers and across centers in the same region (Theil index).

40|$|Clean energy {{technologies}} lower harmful emissions {{associated with the}} generation and use of power (e. g. CO 2) {{and many of these}} technologies {{have been shown to be}} cost effective and to provide significant benefits to adopters. Examples of clean {{energy technologies}} include renewable and/or efficient distributed generation (e. g. solar, wind, geothermal, fuel cells, cogeneration); energy efficiency technologies; intelligent energy management; efficient energy storage; green building technologies; biofuels; and ancillary products and services that reduce emissions associated with power generation, transmission and distribution. This thesis examines why new ventures founded to commercialize these technologies have failed to achieve widespread adoption. Based on interviews with clean energy entrepreneurs and other stakeholders and on case studies of clean energy technology ventures, a new venture simulation model was developed that models the cash flow, labor force, market, competition, and product development for a prototypical clean energy technology venture. When the model is parameterized to correspond to a venture that starts with superior technology at an attractive price its behavior corresponds to the experience of many of the companies interviewed. (cont.) The modeled venture takes many years to achieve profitability due to long sales cycles, limits to market growth, and the time needed to gain experience producing and selling its products, and therefore has a high probability of failure. Analysis of the model results in a set of guidelines for what these ventures, investors, and policy makers should do to increase their odds of success. The venture is better off starting with more sales and marketing personnel and expertise rather than engineers, and should develop no more product features than are necessary to sell the product. The venture should forego recurring revenue and instead receive payments up front whenever possible. A <b>single</b> initial <b>equity</b> investment in the venture is considerably more valuable than a series of investments. Government policies that raise the cost of carbon emissions; reduce barriers and increase incentives for adoption of clean energy technologies; and subsidize the development of these technologies can greatly increase the growth of these ventures and the odds of success. by David S.

40|$|Employee share {{options and}} Black Economic Empowerment deals are {{financial}} instruments {{found in the}} South African market. Employee share options (ESOs) are issued {{as a form of}} non-cash compensation to the employees of the company in addition to their salaries or bonuses. Its value is linked to the share price and since there is no downside risk for the employee his share option is similar to owning a call option on the stock of his employer. Black economic empowerment (BEE) deals in this report refer to those types of transactions structured by listed South African companies to facilitate the transfer of a portion of their ordinary issued share capital to South African individuals or groups who qualify under the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act of 2003 (“the Act”). This Act requires a minimum percentage of the company to be black-owned in order to address the disproportionate distribution of wealth amongst racial groups in South Africa due to the legacy of Apartheid. These transactions are usually structured in such a way to allow the BEE partner to participate in the upside of the share price beyond a certain level but not in the downside which replicates a call option on the share price of the issuing company. The cost of both ESOs and BEE deals has to be accounted for on the balance sheet of the issuing company at its fair-value. Neither of these instruments can be traded and their extended option lifetimes are features that distinguish these deals significantly from regular traded options for which liquid markets exist. This makes pricing them a non-trivial exercise. A number of types of mathematical models have been developed to take the unique structure features into account to price them as accurately as possible. Research by Huddart&Lang (1995 & 1996) has shown that option holders often exercise their vested options long before the maturity of the transactions but are unable to quantify a measure that can be used. The wide variety of factors influencing option holders (recent stock price movements, market-to-strike ratio, proximity of vesting dates, time to maturity, share price volatility and wealth of option holder) as well as little exercise data publicly available prevents the options from being priced in a consistent manner. Various assumptions regarding the exercise behaviour of option holders are used that are not based on empirical observations even though the option prices are sensitive to this input. This dissertation provides an overview of the models, inputs and exercise behaviour assumptions that are recognized in pricing both ESOs and BEE deals under IFRS 2 in South Africa. This puts the reader in a position to evaluate all pricing aspects of these deals. Furthermore, their structuring are also analysed in order to identify the general issues related to them. A number of methods to manage the pricing issue surrounding exercise behaviour on ESOs have been considered for the South African market. The ESO Upper Bound-methodology showed that for each strike there is a threshold at which exercise will occur and the employee can invest the after-tax proceeds in a diversified portfolio with a higher expected return than that of the <b>single</b> <b>equity</b> option. This approach reduces the standard Black-Scholes option value without relying on assumptions about the employee’s exercise behaviour and is a viable alternative for the South African market. The derived option value represents the cost of the option. Seven large listed companies’ BEE transactions are dissected and compared against one another using the fair-value of the transaction {{as a percentage of the}} market capitalization of the company. The author shows how this measure is a more equitable way of assigning BEE credits to companies than the current practice which is shareholding-based. The current approach does not reward the effort (read cost) that a company has undertaken to transfer shares to black South Africans but only focuses on the amount that is finally owned by the BEE participants. This leaves the transaction vulnerable to a volatile share price and leads to transactions with extended lock-in periods that do not provide much economic benefit to the BEE participants for many years. Other inefficiencies in the type of BEE transactions that have emerged in reaction to the BEE codes that have been published by the South African government are also considered. Finally the funding model that is often used to facilitate these deals is assessed and the risks involved for the funder (bank) is reflected on. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

40|$|The {{paper in}} hand shows an {{analysis}} of the applicability of responsible or SRI (Socially Responsible Investment) processes to the asset class of hedge funds. One of the major findings is, that hedge fund investors obviously can create corporate social performance on top of financial performance directly in two ways. The alternatives are to give financial support on the basis of investments or to start a dialogue with the company,the engagement process. On the basis of selling shares short, responsible hedge fund are able to use an additional lever in their engagement process. The paper illustrates that there are currently three different approaches to tackle the process to create a responsible hedge fund product. These are firstly a single strategy fund, secondly an overlay strategy and finally a fund of funds with SRI criteria. On basis of the research done, it seems that a product that would meet the requirements of a high CSP (Corporate Social Performance) creation the best would be based on a <b>single</b> strategy long-short <b>equity</b> product. With regards to the risk aspect, a fund of funds with SRI criteria is preferable in spite of the SRI-research related shortcomings regarding some of the asset classes involved. Clear definitions and research activities regarding missing asset classes like those of commodities and currencies should be a key issue for future research and product development. In addition to that, responsible hedge funds have to meet some essential criteria in order to render strong CSP to investors.

Need is felt an over-all work which would comprise economic, social and praxiological questions of tax equity.

Many Polish authors do not accept principles of tax aquity formulated in the pre-war period and they blame them with "burgeois character". Such an approach is wrong for aquity cannot be conceived as "socialist" or "capitalist". Another obstacle to an orderly discussion about tax equity is raised {{by the lack of}} generally accepted terminology.

40|$|Research {{was largely}} {{consistent}} in predicting a {{negative relationship between}} family ownership and R&D intensity until Chrisman and Patel (2012), using a behavioral agency model (BAM), called this general assumption into question. They argued that publicly owned family firms typically invest less in R&D than non-family owned firms. This behavior may however be reversed if economic performance levels are below family aspirations or if family long-term goals, such as pursuing strong transgenerational family control, are highly valued. While most researchers, like Chrisman and Patel (2012), primarily focused on large listed firms, more research {{on the relationship between}} family ownership and R&D intensity in privately held small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) is required. This is because firm size can {{play an important role in}} understanding the innovation management behavior of firms. Building on the BAM perspective, in the present article it is argued that Chrisman and Patel’s (2012) results can be extended to the context of SMEs, albeit with one important specification: the relationship between family ownership and R&D intensity is likely to be contingent on the way the family has invested its wealth. Specifically, it is contended that in the context of SMEs, where goals are more fluid and mixed, and when there is a high overlap between family wealth and firm equity (i. e., most of the family’s wealth is invested in the firm), the relationship between family ownership and R&D intensity is negative due to the family owners’ greater desire to protect their socioemotional wealth (SEW). However, if the overlap between family’s total wealth and <b>single</b> firm <b>equity</b> is low (i. e., firm equity is just a small part of the total family wealth), the relationship between family ownership and R&D intensity is positive as the low overlap between family wealth and firm equity reduces the family’s loss aversion propensity. In such a situation, family ownership is likely to foster R&D intensity due to the long-term orientation of family owners that increases the family firm’s propensity to bear the risk of investing in R&D activities. The hypothesis is tested and confirmed in a study of 240 small and medium-sized firms based in Italy. The article contributes to the literature in several ways. First, adding to the literature on innovation management and R&D intensity, it increases the understanding of what drives or inhibits R&D investments in SMEs when a family is involved in the ownership of the firm. This is particularly important since research on innovation management, as well as research on R&D intensity in family firms, is primarily focused on large firms and much less on SMEs. Second, the study complements arguments from prior research on the correlates of R&D intensity in large listed firms, showing that the BAM and SEW perspective offer a theoretical framework that is also able to illustrate the complex nature of innovation management in the context of SMEs. Third, the study contributes to research on the effects of family ownership on the general functioning of a firm. In particular, it provides new insights into how family ownership may affect R&D intensity...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. This thesis examines, through the most comprehensive historical-doctrinal analysis to date, {{the nature and extent of}} equity’s jurisdiction to impose trusts arising out of parol agreements. The central argument of this thesis is that all such trusts are enforced pursuant to a <b>single</b> doctrine of <b>equity</b> which arises to prevent fraud. This doctrine, which is uncovered and elucidated in this thesis, is named ‘the doctrine of parol agreement trusts’. It is argued that the ‘fraud’ which brings the doctrine into play will occur if the recipient of property knowingly reneges on a parol agreement subject to which she took the property and upon which the other party thereto relied. Moreover, it is demonstrated that trusts arising for the prevention of fraud were, until the early twentieth century, not seen as express, resulting or constructive trusts, but that, according to modern nomenclature, they are best regarded as constructive trusts. This thesis also challenges several modern orthodoxies. It is proven that the leading case of Rochefocuauld v Boustead was reported imperfectly, and that all previously presented accounts of the facts are inaccurate. Furthermore, it is categorically demonstrated that secret trusts are enforced for the prevention of fraud, but that this is not inconsistent with the notion that secret trusts are dehors the will. The juxtaposition between parol agreement trusts and related equitable innovations such as mutual wills, proprietary estoppel and ‘common intention’ constructive trusts is also examined, as well as the doctrine’s relationship with contract law and the law of agency, with a view to providing a doctrinal solution to some modern controversies in these areas. The historical-doctrinal relationship between parol agreement trusts and other types of constructive trusts is also examined with surprising results which suggest doctrinal affinities with the liability which affects knowing recipients. Finally, it is suggested that the manner in which modern commentators and some judges have eschewed fraud as a justification for parol agreement trusts and other related trusts may represent an unwelcome development...|$|R
