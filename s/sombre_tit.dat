5|$|Strandzha is {{situated}} on Via Pontica, the second-largest bird migratory route in Europe. The bays and estuaries along the Black Sea coast are a wintering destination for some birds. There are 269 avian {{species in the}} park, including populations of global importance of white-backed woodpecker, semi-collared flycatcher, olive-tree warbler and <b>sombre</b> <b>tit,</b> as well as populations of European importance of Egyptian vulture, white stork, black stork, Eurasian eagle owl and four eagle species.|$|E
50|$|It is 12 - 13 cm {{long with}} a weight of 10 - 12.5 g, and {{is similar to}} the related <b>sombre</b> <b>tit</b> (P. lugubris) in appearance, with a black head with white cheeks, dark grey-brown back, wings and tail, and rusty brown underparts.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] Caspian tit (Poecile hyrcanus) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} tit family. It {{is sometimes}} lumped with <b>sombre</b> <b>tit</b> Poecile lugubris (del Hoyo et al. 2007), but some research {{suggests that it is}} a separate species, more closely related to willow and Songar tits (Harrap & Quinn 1996).|$|E
50|$|Species which {{triggered}} the IBA designation include griffon vultures which occur in small numbers, <b>sombre</b> <b>tits,</b> Upcher's warblers, Menetries's warblers, western rock-nuthatches, white-throated robins, Finsch's wheatears, pale rock sparrows and Syrian serins. In winter the reservoir provides habitat for waders and sometimes ducks.|$|R
50|$|Fauna: The common {{birds in}} the reserve include white-throated robin, western rock nuthatch, <b>sombre</b> <b>tit</b> and {{northern}} wheatear. There are many species of butterflies, of which 23 are unique to the Hermon nature reserve and do not exist in Israel. The common reptiles in the reserve include the Vipera bornmuelleri and the four-lined snake.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sombre</b> <b>tit</b> (Poecile lugubris) is {{a member}} of the tit family found in {{southeast}} Europe and southwest Asia.Though it is traditionally placed in Parus, mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data suggest that that genus should be split, as already adopted by the American Ornithologists' Union, for example. This species is part of the chickadee group, which would then make up the genus Poecile. In Poecile, this species forms part of a group of apparently rather basal species, the relationships of which are ill-defined. They also include the varied and probably the white-fronted tit (which were sometimes separated in Sittiparus), and possibly the white-browed and Caspian tits.|$|E
50|$|Most {{authorities}} retain Poecile as a subgenus {{within the}} genus Parus, but the American Ornithologists' Union treats it {{as a distinct}} genus. The most recent molecular taxonomic analysis, using both nuclear and mitochondrial genes, supports Poecile as a distinct clade including the chickadees {{and a group of}} Eurasian tits, the white-browed tit Poecile superciliosus, the <b>sombre</b> <b>tit,</b> P. lugubris, the rusty-breasted tit P. davidi, the marsh tit P. palustris, the Caspian Tit P. hyrcanus and the black-bibbed tit P. hypermelaenus; the Songar tit is included as a subspecies of the willow tit. Within Poecile, most of the Old World species (including the willow tit) are placed a separate clade from the New World species.|$|E

They include red whip snake, Aesculapian snake, European blind snake, sheltopusik (Europe's largest lizard), Kotschy's gecko, European pond turtle, Balkan pond turtle, spur-thighed tortoise, Hermann's tortoise, etc. The sand lizard, which is typical for western Bulgaria but very uncommon to the east, is also present in the park. Ten amphibian species have been recorded, such as European tree frog, eastern spadefoot and southern crested newt. The absence of common reptiles and amphibians, such as fire salamander, common spadefoot and common European viper, is noteworthy.|$|E
