5|$|Meanwhile, Megan {{discovers that}} the {{surgical}} <b>staple</b> gun was tampered with. The guns come in packs of three but the pack was broken up between three surgeries, one {{was given to}} Ted, another to George White (Dan Amboyer) who Megan has to perform emergency surgery on after finding him near-dead, and the third <b>staple</b> gun was not used. Megan finds traces of fungus found on bonsai trees on the <b>staple</b> guns and Megan realizes that Gwen has bonsai trees. When her son died, he was pledging for the fraternity where George is president. Gwen tampered with the <b>staple</b> guns to kill George, not realizing that the pack would be broken up. Ethan and Curtis find out that Jessica had a genetic mutation that caused a blood clot, so Ethan warns Karen that she might also have one. Megan confronts Gwen, who confesses to Megan. Gwen is eventually taken away by the police, after admitting to George's attempted, and Ted's accidental murder.|$|E

50|$|All {{three of}} the last Lissan Baronets {{inherited}} the title well into their eighties and none had any male heirs. As a result, a search was instigated by Debrett's in 1990 seeking the next <b>Staples</b> Baronet and a 10-year Genetic Research Programme started in 2002 which it was hoped would locate the 18th Baronet.

40|$|A <b>stapled</b> {{sequence}} {{is a set}} of consecut ive positive integers such that no one of them is relatively prime with all of the others. The problem of existence and construction of <b>stapled</b> sequences of length N was extensively studied for over 60 years by Pillai, Evans, Brauer, Harborth, Erdos and others. Sivasankaranarayana, Szekeres and Pillai proved that no <b>stapled</b> sequences exist for any N< 17. We give a new simple proof of this fact. There exist several proofs that <b>stapled</b> sequences exist for any N # 17. We show that existence of <b>stapled</b> sequences is equivalent to existence of <b>stapling</b> coverings of a sequence of N consecutive natural numbers by prime arithmetic progressions such that each progression has at least two common elements with the sequence and discuss properties of <b>stapling</b> coverings. We introduce the concept of e#ciency of <b>stapling</b> coverings and develop algorithms that produce e#cient <b>stapling</b> coverings. Using the result by Erdos, we show that the greatest prime number u [...] ...|$|R
