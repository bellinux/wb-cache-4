The study was conducted on 19 locations of water user association called Land Improvement District (LID) which were operated under traditional water right in Kyushu Island, Japan during irrigation period of 1997. Quantitative analysis I, developed by Hayashi, was applied for the analyses. The explanatory variables consisted of 6 items and 18 categories. Each explanatory variable (item and category) was given as dummy variable such as 1 or zero. Results showed that the intake water was affeded by the location of beneficiary area, the intake water for another purposes and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> area. The intake water varied to the roncerning LID. The observed intake water ranged from 26. 10 mm/day to 212. 10 mm/day and the predicted intake water ranged from 24. 53 mm/day to 210. 53 mm/day (Case 1, γ= 0, 96).

40|$|The 2003 reform {{represents}} a significant {{shift in the}} EU policy, particularly in its movement to decoupled support. The potential impact of the reform depends {{on a range of}} factors including the modalities of its implementation and the structure of farming sectors in different countries. The then acceding countries had the flexibility to choose to implement the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) or to opt for the simplified Single Area Payment Scheme (SAPS). This paper attempts to provide a comparative overview of the level and distributional aspects of direct payments across seven New Member States (NMS) covering different sub-regions, the Baltics, Central and Eastern Europe, and the two most recent Member States from the Balkans – Bulgaria and Romania. Although the choice of 10 out of 12 NMS was similar – to implement SAPS – the preaccession policies, the structure of agricultural output and the distribution of farm sizes have created substantial differences in the distribution of support and the choices between decoupled and coupled Complementary National Direct Payments (CNDP) or ‘top-ups’. As expected, due to the phasing-in process there has been a tendency of increased payments per hectare over time; however this increase has not been uniformly manifested. The differences in the output structure and labour intensity, as well as the large differences in farm structures and farm size distribution have brought about substantial differences in amounts of direct payments per beneficiary and AWU. One of the countries with the most concentrated land use in large farms, some of them corporate farms (companies or co-operatives), are the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Hungary and Bulgaria occupy the middle ground, whilst the Baltic States, Poland and Romania are characterised by small size farms almost across the board. This variety across the NMS has substantial implications for several aspects of SAPS implementation and its beneficiaries, including the amount of direct payments per beneficiary, the average <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> and the share of holdings benefitting from the scheme. The share of beneficiaries varies from a small segment of the holdings covered by the Farm Structure Survey (FSS), as for example in Bulgaria and Slovakia, to covering almost all holdings included in FSS (Lithuania). One of the positive signals is that in some NMS the concentration of SAP on a small segment has been decreasing (although slowly) in parallel with the increasing farmers and administration experiences. All these structural and distributional differences mean that setting payments limitations or including (eventually) the NMS in a system of progressive modulation may have widely different effects on different NMS and thus may generate substantially different political positions. Analytical survey results are presented concerning the change (or the lack of) of farmers strategic plans {{as a result of the}} implementation of SAPS in two of the above NMS with contrasting farm structures and payment distribution. The results indicate that as the implementation of SAPS means more predictable and increasing payments in comparison to the pre-accession policy the main change in the strategic farmers’ plans is their increased willingness to stay longer in farming and increase the farm area operated. The expected response to 2003 CAP reform, namely lower incentives to produce and increased drive to diversification to non-farm activities was not detected in this early survey in NMS. However, it is difficult to disentangle the changes induced by SAPS from the general expectations due to accession to the EU.

In carrying out this cross-sectional study, {{data were collected}} with stratified sampling technique, using structured and pre-tested questionnaires from 100 loan beneficiaries and five financial institutions in the zone. The study lasted {{for a period of}} six months, effective April, 2010. Expect value method was used to determine their optimum loan requirement while OLS multiple regression analysis technique was employed in determining factors affecting loan <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> Results showed that the potent factors affecting loan size were farm <b>size,</b> level <b>of</b> education, enterprise type, farmers experience and dependency ratio. The result further indicated that the respondents were highly limited by capital as the financial institutions met only 60 % of their capital needs. The optimum loan requirement determined for the farmers were N 292, 315, and N 435, 753 for Cassava and Yam farmers respectively, for farm <b>size</b> <b>of</b> 0. 80 hectare. For poultry farmers of about 120 birds, the optimum loan requirement estimated was N 492, 500. These figures would serve as reference points for financial institutions in loan administration of farmers of similar status and area. The financial institutions were admonished to consider providing start-up capital for the youths and fresh graduates, who apparently are yet to make in-road into farming as a business. On the other hand, government was urged to provide fiscal and monetary incentives to financial institutions supporting agriculture in view of the delicate nature of farm business...|$|R

Although beneficiary involvement is useful, the challenge is to determine how and when to involve beneficiaries in the project.    The {{purpose of this study is}} to improve the process <b>of</b> managing <b>beneficiary</b> involvement in NGOs. To achieve this, a review of the existing literature was done to have an initial understanding <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> involvement. During our literature review, we identified six progressive levels of involvement which include: information sharing, listening and learning, joint assessment, shared decision-making, collaboration and empowerment.  Based on this literature review, we suggested a framework for managing beneficiary involvement.   In addition, we conducted a multiple case study and collected data from five different cases through interviews. Our respondents were professionals with several years of experience in developing and implementing development projects which are aimed at improving the livelihood of vulnerable communities. Through the analysis of the empirical findings, we got new insights on how the process <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> involvement is managed. We identified four additional levels <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> involvement within the project cycle. These include incentive system, peer facilitators, group forming, and cost sharing.

We also highlighted that the appropriate level <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> involvement should be chosen depending on the project context. Regardless of these factors, the research findings show that beneficiary involvement creates a sense of ownership, enhances project outcome and is useful in sustaining a project’s results in the long term.
