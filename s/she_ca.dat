In March 1901 he married Evangeline Lodge Land, the college-educated descendant of two notable Detroit medical families, {{who had come to}} Little Falls the previous autumn as a teacher. <b>She,</b> <b>C.A.,</b> and his two daughters from a previous marriage moved to a property, which C.A. had purchased for a dairy farm three years earlier. They had a three-story house built on the bluff overlooking the Mississippi River. A tenant's house was built across the road for the farm workers. Charles Augustus Lindbergh was born in 1902, and would be the couple's only child. A barn was built later that year, and the farm was populated with cattle, goats, hogs, sheep, chickens, and pigeons as well as cats and dogs.|$|E
40|$|Recently, English holds a very {{important}} role. It {{is caused by the}} high development of technology. Thus, in Indonesia, formally English begins to be taught from Elementary School. According to the 1994 Curriculum English lesson as a subject begins in the fourth-grade of Elementary School. The goal of English Lesson for the fourth-grade students of Elementary School is students are able to have the working knowledge and language skill of English with the vocabulary mastery of more or less 150 words which includes reading skill, listening skill, speaking skill, and writing skill. Based on this goal, the vocabulary is a base of language learning and the position of the vocabulary is to prepare the students {{to be able to read}} reading passages. The vocabulary is also related with the other skills of language such as listening, speaking and writing. Thus the vocabulary must be learned first by the students. To have a good result in learning, the teacher must give a good technique and create a good learning condition. He/ <b>she</b> <b>ca</b> teach the children to learn by playing. Thus, they do not get difficulties and feel bored. They can be happy and be interested in learning language. Based on the background above, the writer suggests teaching vocabulary through songs and role plays for the fourth-grade students of Elementary School as one of the techniques of learning vocabulary. It is basically easier for students of the techniques of learning vocabulary. It is basically easier for students of Elementary School to learn something through songs and role plays. They need more activities to channel their energies and actions. Furthermore, there are some advantages of using songs and role plays, such as: (1) songs and role plays can make students relax, (2) songs and role plays provide an enjoyable classroom atmosphere, (3) songs and role plays make words easier to remember, etc. In addition, the students and the teacher can spend the time without feeling bored. To apply songs and role plays in the teaching vocabulary, the writer divides three steps. They are: (1) preparation in which the teacher prepares materials, eg. the properties that include cassettes, puppets, costumes, cards, etc., (2) presentation which includes activities that lead the students to learn the vocabulary in the form of songs and role plays, (3) evaluation in which the teacher evaluates the students' mastery of what he has taught. In this study, the writer uses the library research. She gathers some various sources of books which deal with the teaching of vocabulary and how to use songs and role plays for the children. She hopes that this study can help the teacher who wants to improve the students' motivation to achieve the best result and enjoyment in learning English. Finally, the writer realizes that there are still many shortcomings in this study. Therefore, she will happily accept any constructive criticism from the reader...|$|E
