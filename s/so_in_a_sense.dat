The system of public finance {{that had been the}} envy of the world in its Golden Age, enabling it to throw far beyond its weight in world politics up to the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, had become a millstone around its neck. By 1713 the public debt of the province of Holland had reached 310 million guilders; the debt of the Generality was 68 million; and the debts of the smaller provinces, and of the cities came on top of this. The debt service of Holland alone in that year required 14 million guilders, which exceeded its regular tax revenue. Most of this humongous public debt was held by Dutch private citizens, <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> it merely engendered an internal money circuit in the Dutch economy. However, it was mostly concentrated {{in the hands of the}} rentier class, while the debt was serviced by mainly regressive taxes that weighed on the working population. Most importantly, these were taxes levied by the individual provinces, who serviced their own debt, and paid into the Generality coffers according to a repartition schedule last changed in 1616. Attempts to reform this structure during the 18th century were mainly fruitless.|$|E
25|$|A small {{category}} with {{a single}} object {{is the same thing}} as a monoid: the morphisms of a one-object category {{can be thought of as}} elements of the monoid, and composition in the category is thought of as the monoid operation. Functors between one-object categories correspond to monoid homomorphisms. <b>So</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense,</b> functors between arbitrary categories are a kind of generalization of monoid homomorphisms to categories with more than one object.|$|E
25|$|A life-size {{statue of}} Wagner {{swinging}} a bat, atop a marble pedestal featuring admiring children, was forged {{by a local}} sculptor named Frank Vittor, and placed outside the left field corner gate at Forbes Field. It was dedicated on April 30, 1955, and the then-frail Wagner was well enough to attend and wave to his many fans. The Pirates have relocated twice since then, and the statue has come along with them. It now stands outside the main gate of PNC Park. The statue roughly faces {{the site of the}} Pirates' original home, Exposition Park, <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> Wagner has come full circle.|$|E

It was broadcast {{as part of a}} science fiction season on BBC Radio. Broughton acts as the head writer for the show. Dromgoole, the series producer, describes the character of John as being, [...] "a real character trapped in a sci-fi. <b>So</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense,</b> he is our guide into it.

Wilson said, [...] "Since the events of 'Civil War II', there's been {{friction}} between Kamala and her mentor, Captain Marvel. In this arc, we're exploring how complicated legacies can be when they're passed from generation to generation... She's questioning a lot about herself and her mission. Her friends end up stepping into some very important - an unexpected - roles. <b>So</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense,</b> the arc is really about a bunch of chronically under-estimated teenagers who pull together to fight evil." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{is a very}} {{important}} film, Life, and Nothing More..., in that what was filmed was inspired by a journey I had made just three days after an earthquake. And I speak not only of the film itself but also of the experience of being in that place, where only three days before 50,000 people had died. For the survivors, {{it was as if they}} were reborn, having experienced death around them. The earthquake had happened at four or five in the morning, <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> everybody could have been dead and it was almost accidental that they hadn't died. So I didn't just see myself as a film director here, but also as an observer of people who had been condemned to death. So this was a very big influence on me, and the issue of life and death from then on does recur in my films[...]|$|E

50|$|It is {{possible}} that the village was founded in the Anglo-Saxon period, as the word Brook is derived from 'Brock'.

[...] This is, in fact, a quote invented by the interviewer to make the story more interesting. However, when asked, Sutton did write this statement and autograph it for his physician, <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> it is accurate.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, {{when he goes}} to {{join the}} queer lady in the window, Joel accepts his destiny, which is to be homosexual, to always hear other voices and live in other rooms.

2500|$|Due to {{the success}} of his comics, a number of filmmakers have {{expressed}} a desire to make film adaptations over the years. Moore himself has consistently opposed such ventures, stating that [...] "I wanted to give comics a special place when I was writing things like Watchmen. I wanted to show off just what the possibilities of the comic book medium were, and films are completely different." [...] Expressing similar sentiments, he also remarked that [...] "If we only see comics in relation to movies then the best that they will ever be is films that do not move. I found it, in the mid 80s, preferable to concentrate on those things that only comics could achieve. The way in which a tremendous amount of information could be included visually in every panel, the juxtapositions between what a character was saying, and what the image that the reader was looking at would be. <b>So</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense...</b> most of my work from the 80s onwards was designed to be un-filmable." ...|$|E

50|$|The work is {{remarkable}} for {{the level of}} colour-printing craftmanship displayed by the Belgian lithographers Severeyns, Stroobant, and De Pannemaker. Louis-Constantin Stroobant (1814-1872), printed many of the illustrations for the first 10 volumes. Most of the plants depicted in Flore des Serres were available for sale in van Houtte's nursery, <b>so</b> that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> the journal doubled as a catalogue.|$|R
25|$|Theologians {{give the}} name mystery to {{revealed}} truths that surpass {{the powers of}} natural reason, <b>so,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> narrow <b>sense,</b> the Mystery is a truth that transcends the created intellect. The impossibility of obtaining a rational comprehension of the Mystery leads to an inner or hidden way of comprehension of the Christian Mystery that is indicated by the term esoteric in Esoteric Christianity.|$|R
2500|$|Suppose we {{are given}} a {{covariant}} left exact functor F : A → B between two abelian categories A and B. If [...] 0 → A → B → C → 0 is a short exact sequence in A, then applying F yields the exact sequence 0 → F(A) → F(B) → F(C) and one could ask how to continue this sequence {{to the right to}} form a long exact sequence. Strictly speaking, this question is ill-posed, since there are always numerous different ways to continue a given exact sequence to the right. But it turns out that (if A is [...] "nice" [...] enough) there is one canonical way of doing so, given by the right derived functors of F. For every i≥1, there is a functor RiF: A → B, and the above sequence continues like so: 0 → F(A) → F(B) → F(C) → R1F(A) → R1F(B) → R1F(C) → R2F(A) → R2F(B) → ... From this we see that F is an exact functor if and only if R1F = 0; <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> the right derived functors of F measure [...] "how far" [...] F is from being exact.|$|E

6000|$|I may mention however {{that your}} {{exception}} that particularly caught my eye--to [...] "poor old Abraham" [...] for [...] "poor old Abe"--was {{a case for}} change that I remember feeling wholly irresistible. Never, never, under our Father's roof did we talk of Abe, either tout court or as [...] "Abe Lincoln"--it wasn't conceivable: Abraham Lincoln he was for us, when he wasn't either Lincoln or Mr. Lincoln (the Western note and the popularization of [...] "Abe" [...] were quite away from us then:) and {{the form of the}} name in your Dad's letter made me reflect how off, how far off in his queer other company than ours I must at the time have felt him to be. You will say that this was just a reason for leaving it so--and <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> it was. But I could hear him say Abraham and couldn't hear him say Abe, and the former came back to me as sincere, also graver and tenderer and more like ourselves, among whom I couldn't imagine any [...] "Abe" [...] ejaculation under the shock of his death as possible.... However, I am not pretending to pick up any particular challenge to my appearance of wantonness--I should be able to justify myself (when able) only out of such abysses of association, and the stirring up of these, for vindication, is simply a strain that stirs up tears.|$|E

You must know that {{everybody}} connected in any way with the sea was there, because the affair had been notorious for days, ever since that mysterious cable message came from Aden to start us all cackling. I say mysterious, because it was <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> though it contained a naked fact, about as naked and ugly as a fact can well be. The whole waterside talked of nothing else. First thing in the morning as I was dressing in my state-room, I would hear through the bulkhead my Parsee Dubash jabbering about the Patna with the steward, while he drank a cup of tea, by favour, in the pantry. No sooner on shore I would meet some acquaintance, and the first remark would be, [...] "Did you ever hear of anything to beat this?" [...] and according to his kind the man would smile cynically, or look sad, or let out a swear or two. Complete strangers would accost each other familiarly, just for the sake of easing their minds on the subject: every confounded loafer in the town came in for a harvest of drinks over this affair: you heard of it in the harbour office, at every ship-broker's, at your agent's, from whites, from natives, from half-castes, from the very boatmen squatting half naked on the stone steps as you went up--by Jove! There was some indignation, not a few jokes, and no end of discussions as to what had become of them, you know. This went on for a couple of weeks or more, and the opinion that whatever was mysterious in this affair would turn out to be tragic as well, began to prevail, when one fine morning, as I was standing in the shade by the steps of the harbour office, I perceived four men walking towards me along the quay. I wondered for a while where that queer lot had sprung from, and suddenly, I may say, I shouted to myself, [...] "Here they are!" ...|$|E
