5000|$|The Tg500's most {{noticeable}} difference from other Kabinenrollern is its pair of rear wheels. These were driven by halfshafts with universal joints {{at both ends}} and a <b>sliding</b> <b>spline</b> allowing {{the length of the}} shaft to vary, accommodating changes in camber angle. The wheels were suspended by control arms and coil springs with concentric hydraulic shock absorbers. The rear track was 41.1 in ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} engines listed above all used bevel shaft camshaft drives. Large {{aircraft engines}}, particularly air-cooled, saw considerable thermal expansion over {{the height of}} the cylinder block. This made pushrod engines difficult to arrange. As well as the other advantages of direct valve actuation by an overhead camshaft, a bevel shaft with a <b>sliding</b> <b>spline</b> was the easiest way to allow for this expansion. These bevel shafts were usually in an external tube outside the block, and were known as [...] "tower shafts".|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} {{differences}} from these precursors to the Chapman strut. As the Lotus Twelve had inboard disk brakes, {{there was no}} need to pass the braking torque through the radius rods. Chapman also avoided the swing axle and its camber changes with suspension travel, in favour of a drive shaft with two universal joints. The connection between the hub carrier and the shock absorber base was made rigid, making the spring unit into a strut and also controlling the camber angle. Using the drive shaft itself to control the rear track meant that the shaft could be of fixed length, avoiding the need for a <b>sliding</b> <b>spline</b> joint and its stiction problems.|$|E
25|$|Citroën had {{developed}} expertise with front-wheel drive {{due to the}} pioneering Traction Avant, {{which was the first}} mass-produced steel monocoque front-wheel-drive car in the world. The 2CV was originally equipped with a <b>sliding</b> <b>splined</b> joint, and twin Hookes type universal joints on its driveshafts; later models used constant velocity joints and a <b>sliding</b> <b>splined</b> joint.|$|R
40|$|The {{anatomy of}} the eye is well known, however the {{mechanical}} properties and behaviour of the eye are not well known. Knowing these properties could potentially be an improvement for preoperative planning in orbital surgery. To get {{a better understanding of}} the mechanical properties of the eye while it is in movement a Finite Element Model (FEM) has been developed at the TU Delft by Schutte et al. [1]. For the FEM it is important to quantify what part of movement is sliding and what part is deformation because both are modelled in a different manner. We present a complete pipeline to quantify sliding from MRI image volumes. The registration methods previously applied to the orbit are unable to deal with sliding. Therefore, two methods developed for registration problems where sliding occurs are tested for applicability to the orbit using phantoms. The method developed by Berendsen et al. [2], or <b>sliding</b> <b>splines</b> method, performs best on the phantoms, and is applied to the orbit. The results of the <b>sliding</b> <b>splines</b> method are compared to results from regular B-splines registration which has been the registration method used in the orbit up until this project. Amelon et al. [3] have developed a method to characterize sliding from displacement fields, which has never been applied to the orbit. We applied this method to the displacement field generated by the regular B-splines registration and the <b>sliding</b> <b>splines</b> method. Comparison of both registration methods, using the characterization method, shows that methods previously applied to the orbit are unable to preserve sliding in their displacement field. The <b>sliding</b> <b>splines</b> method is able to preserve sliding, but also introduces sliding in regions where it does not occur. We conclude that further study into registration methods that allow for sliding is necessary. Especially, into the <b>sliding</b> <b>splines</b> method since it is able to preserve sliding and shows promising results.

5000|$|The car used a tuned short-stroke (73 mm) {{version of}} the {{bevel-gear}} driven overhead camshaft engine from the 1928 Morris Minor and Wolseley 10. This had already been highly tuned {{for use in the}} Q-type and was further modified, especially in the input area, to improve reliability. It was fitted with a Zoller supercharger and produced [...] at 7200 rpm. The gearbox was a four-speed preselector type unit. At the rear the differential in its aluminium casing was fastened to the chassis and drove the wheels through short shafts with <b>sliding</b> <b>splines</b> and universal joints.|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of consumption and emissions {{is a key}} fac- tor in modern vehicle design. The overall vehicle efficiency is pursued in several ways, including the {{reduction of}} consumption of the auxiliary devices (e. g. water pumps, oil pumps, vacuum pumps etc.). In this paper, using two different smart materials (i. e. magnetorheological fluids and shape memory alloys) a de- vice aimed at disengaging the vacuum pump was developed. The conceived device is composed of a magnetorheological (MR) clutch excited by permanent magnets coaxially manufac- tured with a <b>sliding</b> <b>spline</b> sleeve moved by shape memory alloys (SMA) springs. In the MR clutch, the magnet can move under {{the effect of a}} passive pneumatic system. The magnetic field in the fluid varies with the magnets displacement and as a result two steady positions are possible: the engaged clutch (ON) and the disengaged clutch (OFF). The torque in the ON configuration is high enough to drive the vacuum pump during normal operating conditions, whereas the low torque value in the OFF condition guarantees power saving up to 150 W. In particular operating conditions (i. e. at low environmen- tal temperatures) the torque necessary to start the vacuum pump may exceed the maximum transmissible torque of the MR clutch. For this reason a <b>sliding</b> <b>spline</b> sleeve, actuated by two SMA springs which counteract the force of two traditional springs was developed. A dummy plain sliding sleeve with SMA and con- ventional springs was numerically developed and tested. The fairly good agreement of the results confirmed the feasibility of the combined SMA/MR device...|$|E
5000|$|The 2000 was {{advanced}} for {{the time}} with a de Dion tube suspension at the rear, four-wheel disc brakes (inboard on the rear), and a fully synchromesh transmission. The unibody design featured non-stressed panels bolted to a unit frame, inspired by the Citroën DS. The de Dion set-up was unique in that the [...] "tube" [...] was in two parts that could telescope, thereby avoiding the need for <b>sliding</b> <b>splines</b> in the drive shafts, with consequent stiction under drive or braking torque, while still keeping the wheels vertical and parallel {{in relation to the}} body.|$|R
50|$|In 1956 Chapman {{was using}} de Dion rear axles for his Lotus racing cars {{and also the}} Vanwall. These had {{initially}} used transverse leaf springs, but later changed to coilover shock absorbers. Chapman had identified some of the de Dion's disadvantages as including its high unsprung weight, the need for <b>sliding</b> <b>splines</b> in the rear driveshafts, and also (a typical Chapman fixation) its insensitivity to changes in weight as fuel is consumed. The first Lotus Twelve Formula 2 cars used the same system, although the de Dion's mass was a drawback for a lightweight single-seater racing car.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} rotor {{internal}} friction on the system's stability was studied when operated above the first critical speed. This internal friction is commonly caused by sliding press fits or <b>sliding</b> <b>splines.</b> Under conditions of high speed and low bearing damping, these systems will occassionally whirl at a frequency {{less than the}} shaft's rotational speed. This subsynchronous precession is a self excited phenomenon and stress reversals are created. This phenomenon was observed during engine testing. The reduction of spline friction and/or the inclusion of squeeze film damping have controlled the instability. Case history and the detail design of the squeeze film dampers is discussed...|$|R
40|$|A low noise, {{variable}} discharage area, valve {{is constructed}} having opposed recesses within which {{a pair of}} gates are slidably disposed. Each of the gates is provided with upstream edges having a radius thereon, the radius enabling smooth, accelerated, low noise flow therebetween. The gates are further provided with tracks along each side, which in turn <b>slide</b> along <b>splines</b> set in the side walls of the valve. A threaded rod which rotates in a threaded insert in a rear wall {{of each of the}} gates, serves to move the gates within their respective recesses...|$|R
25|$|Even newer designs {{have the}} bottom bracket spindle, usually hollow and larger {{diameter}} than {{is possible for}} bottom brackets with bearings held inside the bottom bracket shell of a bike frame, for reduced weight and increased stiffness, permanently attached to the right crank (Shimano and others) or the left crank (Race Face). The left crank <b>slides</b> onto a <b>spline</b> and is tightened {{with one or more}} pinch bolts (Shimano) or is pressed onto a spline by a bolt on the bottom bracket spindle (Race Face).|$|R
