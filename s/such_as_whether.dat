5|$|Halotus {{worked as}} a servant for Claudius and also held the {{position}} of official taster, an occupation which entailed his tasting of a portion of every meal Claudius ate each day for poison. Tasters also worked to detect less sinister problems with the Emperor's meal, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>whether</b> the food was fit to be consumed.|$|E
5|$|Lawsuits pending (House v. Price) <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>whether</b> cost-sharing {{subsidies}} must be paid. President Trump threatened {{not to pay}} these subsidies {{in early}} 2017 and later decided to stop paying them. CBO estimated in September 2017 that discontinuing the payments would add an average of 15-20 percentage points to health insurance costs on the exchanges in 2018 while increasing the budget deficit nearly $200 billion over a decade.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to leaving Tips, Foursquare 8.0 lets users rate venues by answering questions. The questions help Foursquare understand how people feel about a place, including <b>such</b> questions <b>as</b> <b>whether</b> {{or not a}} user likes it, how trendy it is, its cleanliness, how noisy it is. It also uses these questions to fill out missing venue information <b>such</b> <b>as</b> asking <b>whether</b> the venue takes credit cards, or whether it has outdoor seating.|$|R

5|$|Orangutans {{are among}} the most {{intelligent}} primates. Experiments suggest they can figure out some invisible displacement problems with a representational strategy. In addition, Zoo Atlanta has a touch-screen computer where their two Sumatran orangutans play games. Scientists hope the data they collect will help researchers learn about socialising patterns, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>whether</b> the apes learn behaviours through trial and error or by mimicry, and point to new conservation strategies.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} welcomed by many critics and reviewers, who found its {{arguments}} convincing and its synthesis {{of a large}} volume of historical evidence compelling. It also aroused criticism {{on a variety of}} grounds, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>whether</b> deaths per capita was an appropriate metric, Pinker's atheism, lack of moral leadership, excessive focus on Europe (though the book covers other areas), the interpretation of historical data, and its image of indigenous people.|$|E
5|$|The {{declaration}} {{had many}} long-lasting consequences. It greatly increased {{popular support for}} Zionism, {{and led to the}} creation of Mandatory Palestine, which later became Israel and the Palestinian territories. As a result it is considered to have caused the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict, often described as the world's most intractable conflict. Controversy remains over a number of areas, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>whether</b> the declaration contradicted earlier promises the British made to the Sharif of Mecca in the McMahon–Hussein correspondence.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{growing number}} of {{services}} available within social applications (viz. Social networks) raises a new and challenging search issue: selecting desired services from social networks. Traditional discovery and selection approaches, which are registry-based (e. g., UDDI, ebXML), have manifested their limitations as they often fall behind users' expectations. This is because registries fail to (i) take into consideration non functional properties <b>such</b> <b>as</b> QoS and trust and (ii) capitalize on the information resulting from the previous experiences between agents. To address these shortcomings, we use software agents as they support interactions and offer well-developed capabilities to formally express and interpret semantic information useful to evaluate trust. Trust in a service is a multi-aspect concept that includes a social-based aspect <b>such</b> <b>as</b> judging <b>whether</b> the provider is worthwhile pursuing before using his services (viz. Trust in sociability), expert-based aspect <b>such</b> <b>as</b> estimating <b>whether</b> the service behaves well and as expected (viz. Trust in expertise) and, recommender-based aspect <b>such</b> <b>as</b> assessing <b>whether</b> an agent is reliable and we can rely on its recommendations (viz. Trust in recommendation) ...|$|R

5|$|The {{scientific}} study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>whether</b> words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.|$|E

5|$|Daily fantasy {{sports have}} faced notable legal challenges, {{including}} disputes over whether DFS constitutes gambling. Politicians {{and other critics}} have argued that due to their format, players are essentially making proposition wagers on the varying performance of individual athletes in specific games, and not managing {{the performance of their}} selections on a week-to-week basis. Proponents have defended DFS as being a game of skill, as the required familiarity with the players and teams, as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players. Local laws have varying definitions of gambling games, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>whether</b> a game's elements of chance are predominant over those or skill, or how much control the player has over the outcome of the game.|$|E

In motoring cases, previous endorsements on the driving record can have consequences, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> a period of disqualification under the “totting-up” rules.|$|R
5|$|Never 7 is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player reads the story, and presses a button to advance through the text. At certain points, the player gets to make choices which affect the {{direction}} the plot proceeds in; these involve choosing what location to move to, and what the player character should say, as well as subtler choices <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>whether</b> to look {{a girl in the}} eyes or to take her hand. The game is presented from a first-person perspective, with pre-rendered backgrounds and 2D character portraits accompanying the text. The visuals mostly consist of still images, but with characters often changing their expression while talking.|$|E
5|$|Uncertainty {{comes in}} four categories: {{conceptual}} uncertainty, evidential uncertainty, ascertainability and administrative unworkability. Conceptual uncertainty arises when {{the language is}} unclear, {{which leads to the}} trust being declared invalid. Evidential uncertainty is where a question of fact, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>whether</b> a claimant is a beneficiary, cannot be answered; this does not always lead to invalidity. Ascertainability is where a beneficiary cannot be found, and administrative unworkability arises when the nature of the trust is such that it cannot realistically be carried out. Trustees and the courts have developed various ways of resolving uncertainties, including the appointment of experts to work out evidential uncertainty, and giving trustees the power to decide who is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E
5|$|When a nodule is present, thyroid {{function}} {{tests are}} performed and reveal {{whether a person}} has a normal amount of thyroid hormones ("euthyroid") or an excess of hormones, usually secreted by the nodule, causing hyperthyroidism. When the thyroid function tests are normal, an ultrasound {{is often used to}} investigate the nodule, and provide information <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>whether</b> the nodule is fluid-filled or a solid mass, and whether the appearance is suggestive of a benign or malignant cancer. A needle aspiration biopsy may then be performed, and the sample undergoes cytology, in which the appearance of cells is viewed to determine whether they resemble normal or cancerous cells.|$|E
50|$|Animal {{studies have}} raised safety {{concerns}} of certain general anesthetics, in particular ketamine and isoflurane in young children. The risk of neurodegeneration was increased in {{combination of these}} agents with nitrous oxide and benzodiazepines <b>such</b> <b>as</b> midazolam. <b>Whether</b> these concerns occur in humans is unclear.|$|R
50|$|Trail/game cameras {{also can}} be helpful for animal loss/rescue in documenting the {{presence}} and species of animals, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> determining <b>whether</b> a frightened runaway dog is returning to its home at night or verifying the species actually eating the food left for a stray/feral cat.|$|R

5|$|Although the {{two leaders}} had a strong relationship, by 1960 US {{officials}} were becoming concerned by what they viewed as Canadian procrastination on vital issues, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>whether</b> Canada should join the Organization of American States (OAS). Talks on these issues in June 1960 produced little in results. Diefenbaker hoped that US Vice President Richard Nixon would win the 1960 US presidential election, but when Nixon's Democratic rival, Senator John F. Kennedy won the race, he sent Senator Kennedy a note of congratulations. Kennedy did not respond until Canadian officials asked {{what had become of}} Diefenbaker's note, two weeks later. Diefenbaker, for whom such correspondence was very meaningful, was annoyed at the President-elect's slowness to respond. In January 1961, Diefenbaker visited Washington to sign the Columbia River Treaty. However, with only days remaining in the Eisenhower administration, little else could be accomplished.|$|E
5|$|Members of the British mission {{occupied}} {{several key}} {{positions in the}} electromagnetic project. Oliphant became Lawrence's de facto deputy, and {{was in charge of}} the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory when Lawrence was absent. His enthusiasm for the electromagnetic project was rivalled only by Lawrence's, and his involvement went beyond scientific problems, extending to policy questions <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>whether</b> to expand the electromagnetic plant, although in this he was unsuccessful. The British chemists made important contributions, particularly Harry Emeléus and Philip Baxter, a chemist who had been research manager at ICI, was sent to the Manhattan Project's Clinton Engineering Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in 1944 in response to a request for assistance with uranium chemistry, and became personal assistant to the general manager. His status as an ICI employee was of no concern to Groves. The British mission was given complete access to the electromagnetic project, both in Berkeley and at the Y-12 electromagnetic separation plant in Oak Ridge. While some of the British mission remained at Berkeley or Oak Ridge only for a few weeks, most stayed until the end of the war. Oliphant returned to Britain in March 1945, and was replaced as head of the British mission in Berkeley by Massey.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} role in the Clan is that of the leader. The Clan leader overlooks all duties of Clan life, and will make all the important decisions, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>whether</b> or not to engage in battle. Each Clan leader is given nine lives by StarClan, in order to sacrifice their lives nine times over to protect their Clan, and to serve their clans for many more moons to come. This means that Clan leaders can often live longer than that of a normal cat. To mark their new status, Clan leaders are given the suffix –star (e.g. Bluestar, Tallstar, and Brokenstar). Generally, Clan leaders sleep alone, although male leaders are allowed to take a mate. Female leaders are inhibited from taking a mate or having kits, which has led to discussions of sexism among many fans of the series.|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} Brahma in Buddhism and other Indian {{religions}} are uncertain, {{in part because}} several related words <b>such</b> <b>as</b> one for metaphysical Ultimate Reality (Brahman), and priest (Brahmin) {{are found in the}} Vedic literature. According to KN Jayatilleke, the Rigveda expresses skepticism about major deities <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Indra <b>whether</b> he even exists, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>whether</b> the universe has any creator and can this ever be known, as evidenced in its eighth and tenth book, particularly in its Nasadiya Sukta.|$|R
