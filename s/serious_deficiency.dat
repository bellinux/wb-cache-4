5|$|Vitamins are {{essential}} for the normal growth and development of a multicellular organism. Using the genetic blueprint inherited from its parents, a fetus begins to develop from the nutrients it absorbs. It requires certain vitamins and minerals to be present at certain times. These nutrients facilitate the chemical reactions that produce among other things, skin, bone, and muscle. If there is <b>serious</b> <b>deficiency</b> {{in one or more}} of these nutrients, a child may develop a deficiency disease. Even minor deficiencies may cause permanent damage.|$|E

50|$|Many South Africans {{also have}} a Thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency. A <b>serious</b> <b>deficiency</b> in this vital {{nutrient}} can cause beriberi, which has the immediate symptom of severe lethargy. If left untreated, Beriberi can cause inflammation {{of the nervous system}} and even heart failure. Heart failure associated with beriberi is especially prominent in Johannesburg, the capital of South Africa.|$|E
50|$|In around 2% of {{patients}} there is severe malabsorption and nutritional deficiency that requires {{restoration of the}} normal absorption. The malabsorptive effect of BPD is so potent that those who undergo the procedure must take vitamin and dietary minerals above and beyond that of the normal population. Without these supplements, there is risk of <b>serious</b> <b>deficiency</b> diseases such as anemia and osteoporosis.|$|E

50|$|Sinn Féin absence was {{disastrous}} in {{the long}} term for the Irish Party, allowing it in the mean time to consolidate its hold on the Irish electorate. The government tried to remedy the <b>serious</b> <b>deficiency</b> by including nominees, who might represent the Sinn Féin viewpoint if not the organisation, the intellectuals - George W. Russell ("Æ") the writer and Edward Lysaght. They were included at the suggestion of Thomas Spring Rice, 2nd Baron Monteagle of Brandon and his son, who had useful contacts in Sinn Féin.|$|E
50|$|In August 2015, Channel 4 aired a show {{in which}} Liekens talked to {{thirteen}} British teenagers about sex and pornography. The one-off programme made headlines across the UK, mainly for her open attitude towards sensitive subjects. According to some the show pointed out that British teenagers suffer a <b>serious</b> <b>deficiency</b> in their sex education, a gap they fill by watching pornography, with a horde of misconceptions as a result. Liekens {{has argued that the}} General Certificate of Secondary Education must include a much broader and mandatory sexual education than at present.|$|E
50|$|A <b>serious</b> <b>deficiency</b> of {{the system}} {{is that it does not}} provide for facial expression, mouthing, eye gaze, and body posture, as Stokoe had not worked out their phonemics in ASL. Verbal {{inflection}} and non-lexical movement is awkward to notate, and more recent analyses such as those of Ted Supalla have contradicted Stokoe's set of motion phonemes. There is also no provision for representing the relationship between signs in their natural context, which restricts the usefulness of the notation to the lexical or dictionary level. Nonetheless, Stokoe demonstrated for the first time that a sign language can be written phonemically just like any other language.|$|E

50|$|Comparisons between FOCAL and BASIC were {{inevitable}} {{since both}} languages were common on smallish computers {{of the same}} era. FOCAL lacked inherent support for strings as data elements which could be assigned to variables. This is generally {{thought to be a}} <b>serious</b> <b>deficiency</b> as compared to the string capabilities in most BASICs. This deficiency, while serious, was not as utterly crippling as it might sound. A surprising amount of string usage in FOCAL programs is devoted to formatting user output. Since FOCAL output was character-stream-oriented, outputting two strings sequentially could sometimes substitute for concatenating them, and procedural tools could be written for performing complex formatted output.|$|E
50|$|He took up {{residence}} at St Mary Hall, Oxford University, leaving after two terms to resume his former life. His gift of improvising songs charmed the Prince Regent into a declaration that {{something must be done}} for Hook, who was appointed accountant-general and treasurer of Mauritius with a salary of £2,000 a year. He was the life and soul of the island from his arrival in October 1813, but a <b>serious</b> <b>deficiency</b> having been discovered in the treasury accounts in 1817, he was arrested and brought to England on a criminal charge. A sum of about £12,000 had been abstracted by a deputy official, and Hook was held responsible.|$|E
50|$|The delays irritated the {{ministry}} of defence such that in February it asked the Ordnance Department when the type could be operational. It was promised that six vehicles would be completed in March and April each if 110 bulletproof tyres of the Veil-Picard type, which had been ordered in December from Michelin in France after export of the American Seiberling-type had been forbidden, were delivered on the due date of 1 April. In fact the tyres would never arrive; and bar a single vehicle to which bulletproof tyres had been experimentally fitted all M39s used normal inflatable truck tyres. But a far more <b>serious</b> <b>deficiency</b> would impede operational use.|$|E

5000|$|Sommer's {{work has}} been called [...] "valuable for drawing {{attention}} to the proliferation of a noncommercial, popular art form in the U.S.A.", however {{there are also some}} criticisms of the book. Wayne Enstice, in his review of Street Art noted [...] "A <b>serious</b> <b>deficiency</b> of his book is the abrasive way he chooses to treat the question"..."Do Social imperatives demand redefinition of the role of artists?" [...] He complains that [...] "Readers are asked to measure the accomplishments of community motivated artists against an antagonistic and oversimplified estimation of studio artists...". Enstice also dislikes Sommer's division between text and art, saying that it is [...] "inappropriate".|$|E
50|$|During the Battle of Britain, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that while aircrew had acquired essential flying skills, they had received little or no training in aerial gunnery. This was a <b>serious</b> <b>deficiency</b> for inexperienced pilots, meaning such training and the teaching of deflection shooting had largely to be carried out or just picked up during operations, resulting in fewer combat successes. For this reason, and after repeated approaches to senior officers by Wing Commander Adolph Malan widely known as ‘Sailor’ Malan, he finally received authority to set up a Fighter Wing at the CGS. He was a respected leader and high-scoring fighter pilot, whose Ten Rules For Air Fighting were already on many fighter squadron notice boards.|$|E
50|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war, the Hampshire (Fortress) RE had a <b>serious</b> <b>deficiency</b> of personnel, and on 5 August it was supplemented by No 4 Company of the Tyne Electrical Engineers (TEE), which took over several of the coast defence searchlight stations around Portsmouth. Two other companies of the TEE moved into Haslar Barracks in Gosport and later took over from No 4 Co RE {{the running of the}} electric light training school. As the war progressed, the requirement for anti-aircraft (AA) searchlights as well as coast defence lights became vital, and the school at Haslar trained a large number of AA detachments for Home Defence and for service on the Western Front and other theatres of the war.|$|E

50|$|The {{design of}} the Tuuli II {{prototype}} began in September 1945 and was led by Torolf Eklund. The prototype was ready {{in the autumn of}} 1948. After this, the development stopped for a couple of years. The Finnish Air Force funded the prototype, and promised an order if it filled their requirements. The requirements had changed, and now the aircraft had to have side-by-side seating. The maiden flight with the Tuuli II was on September 26, 1951. Due to its low wing loading, its turning maneuvers was bad - this was from the military's view a <b>serious</b> <b>deficiency.</b> The aircraft was destroyed on October 26, 1951. The accident happened after the control stick had broken off, due to a forgotten stage of rivetting.|$|E
5000|$|The PURPLE machine {{began to}} replace the RED system in 1938, but initial {{installations}} were at major posts; less important embassies and consulates continued to use the old system. This {{was one of many}} deficiencies in Japanese use of encryption that helped make the PURPLE system vulnerable to cracking, for now there was some identical traffic on both systems, which allowed cribbing. A far more <b>serious</b> <b>deficiency</b> was that the PURPLE machine maintained the [...] "sixes/twenties" [...] division, even though the RED machines had since been modified to allow any six letters to be used for the vowel encryption. After eighteen months of work, the PURPLE device was cracked, and produced important intelligence up {{to the end of the}} war.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{tropical}} climate and thinly soiled coralline substrate, sheep and cattle do not thrive here. Villagers wishing to harvest seafood have the arduous task of climbing the surrounding 120 - 150 m cliffs {{for the return}} journey to the coast. Once at the coast, they are bound to harvest only finned and scaled seafood, not shellfish, lobsters or other marine creatures. The <b>serious</b> <b>deficiency</b> in diet prompted the Solomon Islands government to seed Lake Nggano with tilapia fish. These seem to have thrived in the brackish conditions and are now a staple part of the diet. While coconut crabs are crustaceans, and use the sea to spawn, the Seventh-day Adventists do not eat it {{in accordance with the}} kosher laws in [...] but a few are tempted to its taste, and also enjoying harvesting it.|$|E
