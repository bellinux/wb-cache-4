5|$|As part of baseball's {{expansion}} in the early 1960s, a franchise was awarded to New York, {{to play in the}} National League beginning in 1962, and {{to be known as the}} New York Mets. It was hoped that the new team would be supported by the many former Giant and Dodger fans left without a team when the franchises moved to California after the 1957 season. There were rumors through the 1961 season that Stengel would be the manager, but he initially showed no interest in managing a team that, given the rules for the expansion draft, was unlikely to be competitive. George Weiss had been forced out as Yankee general manager and hired by the Mets. He wanted Stengel as manager, and after talks with the Mets principal owners, Joan Whitney Payson and M. Donald Grant, Stengel was introduced as Mets manager at a press conference on October 2, 1961. Leonard Koppett of The New York Times suggested that Stengel took the job to give <b>something</b> <b>back</b> to the game that had been his life for half a century.|$|E

25|$|The Foundation had {{its origins}} in a wish by Sir Bobby {{on the eve of}} his 75th {{birthday}} to leave behind a legacy for future cancer victims in the North East and give <b>something</b> <b>back</b> to the NHS in return for the care he had received in his own battles against cancer.

25|$|Gilbert, {{with the}} strong {{influence}} {{of his mother and}} family, felt that he wanted to give <b>something</b> <b>back</b> to the community, so he started his foundation which helps inner-city kids, and many other causes such as Breast Cancer and Make A Wish.

The Littlehampton College also hosts 'Roddick Days' such as 'Day of Action' and 'One World'; these events allow students to give <b>something</b> <b>back</b> to their local community and learn about what is happening around them.|$|E
25|$|Scrambling for a home, Tatham seriously {{considered}} playing in Honolulu for its inaugural 1984 season, but settled on Tulsa, Oklahoma—even though {{the city had}} not even been included in a list of possible expansion sites for the USFL. However, Tatham had roots in Oklahoma (his father had moved to California during the Great Depression), and felt that putting his team there would give <b>something</b> <b>back</b> to the state.

The club was the second major-league sports team {{to play in the}} state, after the North American Soccer League's Tulsa Roughnecks, and played at Skelly Stadium.|$|E
25|$|Coming out on {{the third}} morning, {{it looked as though}} West Indies would get <b>something</b> <b>back</b> when Jayawardene and Samaraweera fell in quick {{succession}} to Jermaine Lawson, who had been reported to the ICC for chucking (or throwing) the ball, in the second over of the day, but Sangakkara and Dilshan stood firm amid showers, as Lawson and Powell worked diligently without reward. In 35 overs, the pair added 109 runs, as Sri Lanka worked their way towards a big lead. Sangakkara made it to stumps with an unbeaten 135 having hit a 200-ball century, while Omari Banks got two wickets – of Dilshan and Vaas. However, at stumps Sri Lanka were 340 for 7.|$|E

25|$|A second {{explanation}} {{issued by}} Janssen and Vanhamme {{is that of}} reciprocal altruism. This is a key concept in evolutionary psychology that is argued to fuel all human behaviour: people only do something {{if they can get}} <b>something</b> <b>back</b> in return. In the case of CSR and ethical consumerism, however, consumers get very little in return for their investment. Ethically sourced or manufactured products are typically higher in price due to greater costs. However, the reward for consumers is not much different from that of a non-ethical counterpart. Therefore, evolutionary speaking making an ethical purchase is not worth the higher cost to the individual even if they believe in supporting ethically, environmentally and socially beneficial causes.|$|E
500|$|Other guest-stars {{were cast}} locally. Ghanaian actors Kwame O.

Conrad adamantly denied both reports, commenting that [...] "if I ever tried to get <b>something</b> <b>back</b> from Jason, it was probably just photo albums and stuff" [...] and the producers [...] "videotape my life five days out of the week.

500|$|On 6 December 2004 an {{expanded}} version of The Holy Bible was released, containing two CDs and a DVD. Disc one comprised a digitally re-mastered {{version of the}} original album plus four live tracks. The DVD features {{an interview with the}} band, footage of TV and festival appearances and promo videos. The second disc includes a remix of the album by Tom Lord-Alge. The remixed version had been intended for release in the US, but this never happened [...] "for well-documented reasons", according to James Dean Bradfield. The band felt the second mix was superior to the version originally released.

500|$|Rudolph Cartier, {{one of the}} BBC's best-regarded directors, {{directed}} the serial. He and Kneale had collaborated on the play Arrow to the Heart, and worked closely on the initial storyline to make it suit the television production methods of the time. Kneale claimed to have picked his leading character's unusual last name at random from a London telephone directory. He chose the character's first name, Bernard, in honour of astronomer Bernard Lovell. The working titles for the production were The Unbegotten and Bring <b>Something</b> <b>Back...!,</b> the latter a line of dialogue in the second episode. Kneale had not finished scripting the final two episodes of the serial before the first episode was transmitted. The production had an overall budget of just under £4000. The theme music used was [...] "Mars, Bringer of War" [...] from Gustav Holst's The Planets.|$|E
