The quantitative analysis revealed {{that there was a}} significant difference at (p< 0. 05) in saponins content of white <b>cola</b> <b>nut</b> when compared with red <b>cola</b> <b>nut</b> which has the highest percentage of saponins content (20. 60 %) than red <b>cola</b> <b>nut</b> with (10. 80 %). While no significant difference in the contents of alkaloid, flavonoids, tannins and glycosides. The alkaloids contents of red <b>cola</b> <b>nut</b> was higher (16. 07 %) when compared to white <b>cola</b> <b>nut</b> with (14. 40 %), while flavonoids contents of white <b>cola</b> <b>nut</b> was high (6. 33 %) compared to red <b>cola</b> <b>nut</b> with (5. 60 %), glycoside contents of white <b>cola</b> <b>nut</b> (6. 76 %) to that of red <b>cola</b> <b>nut</b> with (5. 68 %) and tannin content of white <b>cola</b> <b>nut</b> (1. 18 %) as compared with the red <b>cola</b> <b>nut</b> (1. 12 %). Conclusively this proved the scientific basis for the traditional uses of the plant extracts that have long being the knowledge for many years. It therefore recommended that further research study should be conduct on characterization of bioactive secondary metabolite of <b>cola</b> <b>nut</b> with a view of stabilizing the active ingredient so that they can be prevented from losing their potency...|$|R

40|$|Natural <b>cola</b> <b>nut</b> {{shells and}} its active carbons {{were used to}} remove indigo carmine dye from aqueous {{solution}} using batch adsorption test. The effect of pH, contact time (t), adsorbent dose (m) and initial concentrations (Co) were investigated. The equilibrium adsorption data were analyzed by Langmuir, Freundlich, Tempkin and Dubin-Kaganer-Raduskushkevich classical isotherm models. This equilibrium data best fits with all the four isotherm models for <b>cola</b> <b>nut</b> shells. Langmuir and Freundlich equations correlated well with data obtained using activated carbon based H 3 PO 4 while Freundlich and Tempkin best agreed with activated carbon based KOH. The kinetics of indigo carmine dye was discussed by pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, Elovich and Intra-particle diffusion models. The pseudo-second order kinetic model equation fitted best to the data from all the three adsorbents. Elovich fitted best with data obtained using activated carbon based H 3 PO 4 while intra-particle diffusion model for activated carbon based KOH. D-K-R shows that adsorption process was chemisorption for all the three adsorbents. Natural <b>cola</b> <b>nut</b> shells and activated carbon based KOH show higher adsorption capacities with indigo carmine compared to activated carbon based H 3 PO 4. The results indicated that these shells and it active carbon {{can be used as}} an effective and low-cost adsorbent to remove indigo carmine from aqueous solution...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{regeneration}} of Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> {{depends on}} tree-fall {{gaps in the}} forest. However, shifting cultivation fallows also create comparable biotic and abiotic opportunities for the dispersion and establishment of this gap-loving species. At the same time, the ability of Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> to resprout enables fallow individuals to survive successive slash-and-burn cycles. Recognizing the importance of shifting cultivation for the food security of forest dwellers, we investigated whether {{the high level of}} Brazil nut regeneration found in cultivation fallows could be explained by the resprouting capability of Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees,</b> the number of cultivation cycles, past agricultural use and distance to the nearest conspecific productive adults. We found that the Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>tree</b> population density increased from 8. 86 treesha− 1 to 13. 69 treesha− 1 and 27. 09 treesha− 1 at sites after one, two and three or more shifting cultivation cycles, respectively. As a consequence of resprouting, after a certain number of shifting cultivation cycles, the fallows become dominated by Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees,</b> and the landholders may decide to preserve them and to exclude enriched sites from future agricultural use. Protected for their extractive value, the secondary forests spontaneously enriched with Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> are allowed to develop into nut-producing forests that have reduced chances of conversion into crops or pastures, thus reversing the classical process of Amazon forest degradation...|$|R

40|$|In the State of Acre, the Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>tree,</b> Bertholletia excelsa (Lecythidaceae), is {{classified}} {{by the local}} population into two types according to morphological characteristics, including color and quality of wood, shape of the trunk and crown, and fruit production. We examined the reliability of this classification by comparing morphological and molecular data of four populations of Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> from Vale do Rio Acre in the Brazilian Amazon. For the morphological analysis, we evaluated qualitative and quantitative information of the trees, fruits, and seeds. The molecular analysis was performed using RAPD and ISSR markers, with cluster analysis. Significant {{differences were found between}} the two types of Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> for the characters diameter at breast height, fruit yield, fruit size, and number of seeds per fruit. Despite the significant correlation between the morphological characteristics and the popular classification, we observed all possible combinations of morphological characteristics in both types of Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees.</b> In some individuals, the classification did not correspond to any of the characteristics. The results obtained with molecular markers showed that the two locally classified types of Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> did not differ genetically, indicating that there is no consistent separation between them...|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} {{multiple}} forest management systems is contingent {{on a variety}} of social, economic, biophysical, and institutional factors, including the integration of timber and non-timber forest product (NTFP) extraction and management. Selective logging for timber is increasingly taking place in forests where the collection of Brazil nuts, a high-value Amazonian NTFP, also occurs. We report on logging damage to Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> in three certified timber concessions in Northern Bolivia from which timber is harvested using reduced-impact logging (RIL) guidelines and nuts are gathered yearly from the ground by local people. Observed frequencies of logging damage to Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> were low, likely mirroring the low intensity of timber harvesting (0. 5 trees/ha and 5 m 3 /ha) being currently applied across the study area. Of the trees 10 cm in diameter at breast height about 0. 1 Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> and 0. 4 timber species per hectare suffered some degree of logging damage. Crown loss was the predominant damage type for Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> accounting for 50 % of all damage. In spite of the observed low rates of tree damage, we further recommend that RIL guidelines be amended to include the pre-harvest marking of prereproductive Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> along with the future crop trees of commercial timber species. Further refining directional felling to reduce crown damage to Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> would also serve to helpmaintain nut yields in the long term...|$|R
