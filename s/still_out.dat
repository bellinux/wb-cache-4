5|$|By 17 November the Mafeking and Pretoria districts {{had been}} fully explored, {{with more than}} 200 bodies raised to the surface in the {{preceding}} two days. On 20 November an official announcement reported that 439 miners had died, of whom 33 were still unaccounted for. Toward {{the end of the}} month, the men voted to return to work, even though the western workings were <b>still</b> <b>out</b> of action and 11 bodies were still missing.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{was named}} to a 24-player {{preliminary}} roster for a two-game series in November 2010. Harris was then called into a six-day training camp in January 2011 in Carson, California {{leading up to the}} 2011 Four Nations Tournament. Because Solo was <b>still</b> <b>out</b> with a shoulder injury and Jill Loyden was out with a broken hand, Harris {{was named to}} the roster for the tournament to back-up Nicole Barnhart.|$|E
5|$|Having {{undergone}} {{knee surgery}} on 18 April 2010, and missing {{the end of}} the Premier League season, Torres' rehabilitation and fitness was closely monitored by Spain manager Vicente del Bosque. Although <b>still</b> <b>out</b> injured, Torres was selected for Spain's 2010 FIFA World Cup squad in May. On 8 June, Torres made his first appearance on the field in exactly two months, coming on as a substitute on 66 minutes against Poland in a pre-World Cup friendly.|$|E

5|$|With AMI Stadium <b>still</b> <b>out</b> of commission, the Crusaders adopted Rugby League Park (which {{has been}} renamed Christchurch Stadium temporarily) in Addington as their home ground {{for that and}} future seasons to recentralise their games in one {{location}} {{as opposed to the}} road show that was the 2011 season. The ground had a limited makeover, taking it to an 18,600 capacity stadium and bringing its facilities to the minimum standards required by the Super Rugby competition.|$|E
5|$|After this, the Australian Corps {{was removed}} from the line for rest and {{training}} in preparation for further operations. In order {{to make up for the}} losses the Australians had suffered during the previous months, a number of Australian battalions were disbanded at this time to provide reinforcements to those that remained. The 32nd Battalion received a large number of reinforcements from the all-Victorian 29th Battalion, which was subsequently disbanded. It was <b>still</b> <b>out</b> of the line when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. During the battalion's final series of battles, the battalion was led by Major Blair Wark, who was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his leadership and bravery.|$|E
5|$|Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) {{is seated}} in a chair in Assistant Director Walter Skinner's office, where he is shown a video from the morgue. Skinner tells him that Miles is somehow alive and <b>still</b> <b>out</b> to get Scully and her unborn child. Suddenly, Agent Gene Crane comes to Doggett and tells him {{that there is a}} person—Knowle Rohrer—who wants to see him, about issues {{concerning}} Miles and Scully. This leaves Fox Mulder and Skinner to interrogate Krycek. Rohrer fabricates a story to Doggett that Miles is part of a Military Project to create a super soldier and that Scully had a chip put {{in the back of her}} neck during her abduction to make her pregnant with the first organic version of a super soldier.|$|E

5|$|During {{his next}} {{appearance}} at the 2003 World Championships in Finland, Luongo began the tournament as backup to the Phoenix Coyotes' Sean Burke. He earned wins against Latvia in the preliminaries and Switzerland in the qualifying round. During the semifinals against the Czech Republic, Luongo replaced Burke {{after he left the}} game with a lower-body injury eight minutes into the second period. Luongo allowed four goals in relief, but earned the win as Canada defeated the Czechs 8–4. With Burke <b>still</b> <b>out</b> for the gold medal game, Luongo made 49 saves against Sweden in a 3–2 overtime win. Despite Luongo's medal round efforts, Burke was named the Best Goaltender for the tournament, as he played in the majority of Team Canada's games. The gold-medal winning 2003 team was later named the Canadian Press national sports team of the year on January 2, 2004.|$|E
5|$|Spence and Stilwell were arraigned on {{the robbery}} charges before Justice Wells Spicer, who set their bail at $7,000 each. They were {{released}} after paying their bail, but Spence and Stilwell were rearrested by Virgil for the Bisbee robbery a month later, on October 13, {{on the new}} federal charge of interfering with a mail carrier. The newspapers, however, {{reported that they had}} been arrested for a different stage robbery that occurred (October 8) near Contention City. Occurring less than two weeks before the O.K. Corral shootout, this final incident may have been misunderstood by the McLaurys. While Wyatt and Virgil were <b>still</b> <b>out</b> of town for the Spence and Stilwell hearing, Frank McLaury confronted Morgan Earp, telling him that the McLaurys would kill the Earps if they tried to arrest Spence, Stilwell, or the McLaurys again.|$|E
5|$|Word of Lamellerie's {{preparations}} reached Collingwood, and {{he planned}} a ruse {{to lure the}} French frigate squadron out into open water. Withdrawing all the large vessels of the blockade squadron, Collingwood kept only the 36-gun frigate HMS Hydra and the 18-gun sloop HMS Moselle in position to create {{the impression that the}} principal blockading force had been driven off. This it was hoped would draw Lamellerie into an attack on the lone ships that would allow the rest of Collingwood's squadron, hidden just beyond the horizon, to counterattack and annihilate the French squadron. However, on 23 February a strong westerly wind blew up and the main squadron, Hydra and Moselle were all blown too far to the east. This was spotted by lookouts on shore and Lamellerie took the opportunity to leave port on 26 February, while the British ships were <b>still</b> <b>out</b> of position.|$|E

5|$|Against the Baltimore Ravens in week twelve, the Bears wore their 1940s {{alternate}} uniforms. The Bears last {{played the}} Ravens in 2009, which {{ended with a}} Baltimore 31–7 victory. With Jay Cutler <b>still</b> <b>out,</b> Josh McCown continued to play as quarterback for the Bears, who had the eighth-best passing offense in the league with 261.7 yards per game, which competed against the Ravens' 18th-ranked pass defense. On the ground, the Ravens had the tenth-best rushing D with 102.6 rushing yards allowed per game, but offensively, had the 30th-ranked rushing offense, averaging just 73.1 yards per game, going against Chicago's defense which allowed 129.4 rushing yards per game. Against Joe Flacco, the Bears {{had the opportunity to}} force turnovers, as Flacco had thrown eleven interceptions in the previous nine games. For the Bears on offense, a liability was to protect McCown from Terrell Suggs and Elvis Dumervil, who combined for 17 of 32 sacks by the Ravens. Two parties had the majority favoring the Bears for the game: 10 of 13 ESPN analysts predicted a Bears victory, with Ron Jaworski, Seth Wickersham and Cris Carter being the only three to predict a win for Baltimore. CBS Sports analysts predicted the Ravens would win in a 5–4 vote.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fire}} was going into its sixth hour it had spread up to the 26th floor. With {{inadequate}} water pressure coming from the standpipes, firefighters stretched hoses up the building's stairwells to help fight the fire. While hoses were being taken up to the fire a sprinkler technician arrived to fix the water pressure. This improved the hose streams, but the fire had engulfed several floors {{and could not be}} contained with just hoses. By 7:00 AM, almost eleven hours into the fire, firefighters were able to get control of the fire on the 22nd through 24th floors, but {{the fire was}} <b>still</b> <b>out</b> of control on the 25th and 26th floors and was spreading upwards. Structural damage observed inside the building by firefighters and consultations with a structural engineer led to fears that the damaged floors might collapse. At 7:00 AM an order to evacuate the building was issued by Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer, and the building was completely evacuated by 7:30 AM. After the evacuation, the only fire suppression efforts left were water streams being directed to the building from the neighboring Girard Trust Building and One Centre Square.|$|E
5|$|At 23:56, {{the convoy}} passed south of Zembra Island towards Kelibia on Cap Bon, {{to avoid the}} minefields between Africa and Sicily, <b>still</b> <b>out</b> of formation. Three {{minesweeping}} destroyers sailed ahead, followed by the cruisers Kenya, Manchester and two freighters. Charybdis and the destroyers Eskimo and Somali from Force Z were still some hours behind and Ashanti was steaming fast to overhaul the main body. Three destroyers remained with nine of the merchantmen and Bramham was en route after Deucalion had been sunk. The {{main part of the}} convoy was attacked at 00:40 by four boats of the German III Squadron and 13 torpedo boats of the Italian 18° MAS, 2° MS and 20° MAS, which made fifteen attacks; the long line of merchant ships and the reduced number of escort ships providing an easy target. The 18° MAS detected the convoy on radar, south-east of Pantellaria and attacked the escorts {{at the head of the}} procession, coming under fire as they fired torpedoes to no effect. The Italian boats then attacked the merchant ships.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{tensions}} between Osden and the rest, he is sent alone to do a species survey in the forest. While he is <b>still</b> <b>out</b> alone, Porlock, one of the scientists on the team, is scared by what he believes {{to be a large}} ape in the forest. The other team members investigate for a couple of days, without finding anything, before Osden fails to contact them at a pre-assigned time. Tomiko leads three others to his camp in the forest, where they find him knocked out, apparently by an unknown assailant. They bring him back to camp, where he gradually recovers, and tells the group that he had felt a strong fear response from the forest itself. Tomiko realizes that the assailant must {{have been one of the}} other team members. While Osden is asleep, the fear emanations from the forest drive Porlock to verbally lash out at Osden, and admit to trying to kill him in the forest. Porlock attempts to assault Osden again, but the others restrain him and place him under a sedative.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{management}} {{officials in}} Fredericton {{stated that it}} could be years before the city fully recovered from the storm. Power restoration in the province reached over 99 percent on July16 with only 750customers <b>still</b> <b>out.</b> However, a thunderstorm that evening revealed the weak nature of the power grid as outages jumped back over 4,000. The following week, Energy Minister Craig Leonard rebutted claims that a public review of NB Power was necessary, despite the longevity and severity of the power outages. New Brunswick's Liberal and Green parties both supported an independent review of the company, while Leonard claimed only an internal review was necessary. The total cost to restore and repair damage to the power grid wrought by the storm amounted to C$8.4million (US$7.5million). This ranked it as the second-costliest event for Nova Scotia Power from a tropical cyclone, only behind Hurricane Juan. New Brunswick Power reported even greater losses from Arthur with damage amounting to C$23million (US$20.1million). This marked the costliest disaster in the company's history, surpassing the December 2013 ice storm. In light of the severe damage, NB Power allocated an extra C$5.1million (US$4.5million) for tree trimming during the 2014-2014 fiscal year.|$|E
5|$|On June 29, 2008, Edge faced Batista in a {{match for}} his title at Night of Champions. Due to {{interference}} from La Familia and a belt shot from Edge, {{he was able to}} defeat Batista. The next night on Raw, which happened a week after that year's draft lottery, Edge came out to gloat about his victory as well as the fact that, thanks to the draft, both the WWE Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship were both SmackDown property (Triple H, who was the reigning WWE Champion at the time, was drafted to SmackDown and had retained his title at Night of Champions as well). As Edge was leaving the ring, an angry Batista (who had been drafted back to Raw after three years as a SmackDown wrestler) came out and chased Edge back to the ring. He proceeded to assault Edge, finishing with a Batista Bomb in the ring. Just as Batista was leaving, CM Punk ran to the ring carrying the Money in the Bank briefcase he had won at WrestleMania XXIV, with referee Mike Chioda tagging along with him. Since Edge was <b>still</b> <b>out</b> of it from the attack, he did not see Punk come into the ring and therefore was unaware that Punk was cashing in his contract. Once the bell rang, Punk simply hit Edge with a Go To Sleep and pinned him to win the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
