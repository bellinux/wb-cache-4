5|$|The hookbill's {{distinguishing}} characteristic was a heavy, parrotlike bill. The {{upper mandible}} hooked <b>sharply</b> downwards, while the heavy lower mandible hooked <b>sharply</b> upwards towards {{the middle of}} the upper mandible. This structure left a gap between the two mandibles when the bird held its beak closed. It is believed that the bill was pale pink in coloration. The jaw muscles were particularly well developed around the bill. The hookbill's tongue was primitive and nontubular.|$|E

5|$|From the Sea of Marmara, {{the wall}} turns <b>sharply</b> to the northeast, {{until it reaches}} the Golden Gate, at about 14m above sea level. From there and until the Gate of Rhegion the wall follows {{a more or less}} {{straight}} line to the north, climbing the city's Seventh Hill. From there the wall turns <b>sharply</b> to the northeast, climbing up to the Gate of St. Romanus, located near the peak of the Seventh Hill at some 68m above sea level. From there the wall descends into the valley of the river Lycus, where it reaches its lowest point at 35m above sea level. Climbing the slope of the Sixth Hill, the wall then rises up to the Gate of Charisius or Gate of Adrianople, at some 76m height. From the Gate of Adrianople to the Blachernae, the walls fall to a level of some 60 m. From there the later walls of Blachernae project <b>sharply</b> to the west, reaching the coastal plain at the Golden Horn near the so-called Prisons of Anemas.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kate was the second-longest lived {{tropical}} cyclone in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. The eleventh tropical storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the season, Kate developed from a tropical wave {{in the central}} tropical Atlantic on September 25. Its unusual track included four major changes in direction. The storm moved northwestward until a weakness in the subtropical ridge forced it eastward. Kate strengthened to a hurricane, turned <b>sharply</b> westward while moving around a mid-level low, and intensified to a 125mph (205km/h) major hurricane on October 4. Kate turned <b>sharply</b> northward around the periphery of an anticyclone, weakened, and became extratropical after passing {{to the east of}} Newfoundland. The extratropical storm persisted for three days until losing its identity near Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|Mountains {{close to}} the coast prevent Mediterranean {{influences}} from extending inland, giving the central Anatolian plateau of the interior of Turkey a continental climate with <b>sharply</b> contrasting seasons.|$|E

5|$|The 20th century saw an {{increase}} in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal. Beginning in the 1920s, lead was added to gasoline to improve its combustion; lead from this exhaust persists today in soil and dust in buildings. Blood lead levels worldwide have been declining <b>sharply</b> since the 1980s, when leaded gasoline began to be phased out. In those countries that have banned lead in solder for food and drink cans and have banned leaded gasoline additives, blood lead levels have fallen <b>sharply</b> since the mid-1980s.|$|E

5|$|A {{more modern}} and {{convenient}} competing bridge opened nearby at Chelsea Bridge in 1858, and usage of Battersea Bridge fell <b>sharply.</b> There were serious public {{concerns about the}} safety of the bridge by this time, after an 1844 incident in which a woman was murdered on the bridge in view of one of the toll collectors, who did not intervene because both parties had paid their fares.|$|E
5|$|A {{rough cut}} premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, but {{post-production}} work continued, {{and the film}} was not released in France until almost a year later. A cut-down version was released in the United States and United Kingdom in September 2010. The critical response was <b>sharply</b> divided: positive reviews described the film as captivating and innovative, while negative critics called it tedious and puerile. The film performed poorly at the box office.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of {{productive}} species including carp, salmon, tilapia and catfish are farmed commercially, producing {{millions of tons of}} protein-rich food per year. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization expects production to increase <b>sharply</b> so that by 2030, perhaps sixty-two percent of food fish will be farmed.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm developed on November23 about 460mi (740km) northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles. It moved northeastward, strengthening to peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) on November24. It later turned <b>sharply</b> {{to the west}} as it began a weakening trend, followed by a curve to the north. The cyclone dissipated on November26 about 450mi (725km) east-northeast of Bermuda, without ever affecting land.|$|E
5|$|According to the chronicles of the Hindu monastic institution, the Kanchi matha, the matha was {{temporarily}} transferred to Kumbakonam in the 1780s following {{an invasion of}} Kanchipuram by Hyder Ali of Mysore. When Tipu Sultan invaded {{the east coast of}} South India in 1784, Kumbakonam bore the brunt of his invasion. The produce fell <b>sharply</b> and the economy collapsed. Kumbakonam did not recover from the calamity till the beginning of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|After 1966, in {{a radical}} {{departure}} from past policies, the Ministry of Economy announced a programme to reduce rising inflation while promoting competition, efficiency, and foreign investment. The anti-inflation programme focussed on controlling nominal wages and salaries. Inflation decreased <b>sharply,</b> decreasing from an annual rate of about 30% in 1965–67 to 7.6% in 1969. Unemployment remained low, but real wages fell.|$|E
5|$|After Cimarron Creek Wash enters {{from the}} right, Fossil Creek turns <b>sharply</b> south. In the next stretch, Stehr Lake {{is to the}} right and Deadman Mesa to the left. Hardscrabble Creek enters from the left just before Fossil Creek turns west again and enters the Verde River.|$|E
5|$|Although a honeyeater in origin, {{the striped}} honeyeater's food source is {{primarily}} insects, and its diet includes seeds and fruits {{as well as}} nectar. Its bill has evolved to a short, straight, <b>sharply</b> pointed shape more suited to probing crevices for insects, than to probing flower tubes. It has the honeyeater’s brush tongue and takes nectar from shallow flowers such as eucalypt blossoms.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Two {{intensified}} over open waters, the season's third {{storm was}} identified on August9. Initially tracking westward, the hurricane turned <b>sharply</b> north, maintaining an intensity of 85mph (140km/h) during its known existence. Briefly slowing on August11, the system quickly picked up forward speed {{as it turned}} northwestward, paralleling the coastline of the Baja California Peninsula. On August14, the hurricane turned north once more; however, it lost its identity the following day {{off the coast of}} Baja California.|$|E
5|$|As it {{approached}} the hospital, the line split; the southern fork {{led to a}} siding to the north-west of the hospital, while the other turned <b>sharply</b> east and south through almost 180° before splitting again. One fork ran into a large workshop and the other led to a short platform, which was initially used for passengers. Following the suspension of passenger services it was converted into a coal dock.|$|E
5|$|Ashland, {{originally}} called Ashland Mills, {{was named}} after Ashland County, Ohio, the original home of founder Abel Helman, and secondarily for Ashland, Kentucky, where other founders had family connections. Ashland has a mayor-council government assisted by citizen committees. Historically, its liberal politics have differed, often <b>sharply,</b> {{with much of the}} rest of southwest Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Bautista throws three pitches: a fastball, a curveball, and a changeup. His fastball {{travels in}} the high 90mph range. His curve can break down <b>sharply,</b> and he learned the changeup from Pedro Martínez. Wildness had {{been a problem for}} Bautista {{throughout}} his career. He has trouble controlling his fastball and walks a great deal of hitters, which has often contributed to his departure from teams.|$|E
5|$|Bewick is {{best known}} for his A History of British Birds, which is admired today mainly for its wood engravings, {{especially}} the small, <b>sharply</b> observed, and often humorous vignettes known as tail-pieces. The book was the forerunner of all modern field guides. He notably illustrated editions of Aesop's Fables throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|Claims of {{intermediate}} mass {{black holes}} {{have been met}} with some skepticism. The heaviest objects in globular clusters are expected to migrate to the cluster center due to mass segregation. As pointed out in two papers by Holger Baumgardt and collaborators, the mass-to-light ratio should rise <b>sharply</b> towards {{the center of the}} cluster, even without a black hole, in both M15 and Mayall II.|$|E
5|$|Cormorants are {{medium to}} large aquatic birds with mainly dark plumage {{and areas of}} {{coloured}} skin on the face. The bill is long, thin and <b>sharply</b> hooked for catching fish and aquatic invertebrates. They nest in colonies, usually by the sea. There are about 39 species worldwide, with two recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
