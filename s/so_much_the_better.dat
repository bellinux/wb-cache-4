Frank Berryman, the 6th Division's General Staff Officer (Grade 1), and Alan Vasey, the Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General (DA), were eager for Robertson to do well and show that Staff Corps officers could make good commanders, and if {{that could be done}} at the expense of an old-style reservist like Stanley Savige, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>better.</b> They pushed for Robertson's 19th Infantry Brigade, then in reserve, to be committed when the attack by Savige's 17th Infantry Brigade slowed down. The abrupt manner in which this was done generated antipathy between Robertson and Savige.|$|E

Sorrow had evidently passed over the fair, calm countenance before me, but had left resignation there as its only trace. Her expression was still youthful--youthful in its kindness and its candor especially. It was only when I looked at her hair, that was now growing gray--at her wan, thin hands--at the faint lines marked round her mouth--at the sad serenity of her eyes, that I fairly detected the mark of age; and, more than that, the token of some great grief, which had been conquered, but not banished.

60|$|Yet {{when the}} record is completed, it falls short {{of what might have}} been {{expected}} from one with so many natural endowments, such unrivalled opportunities, such undoubted sincerity of interest. Pattison had none of what <b>so</b> <b>much</b> delighted Carlyle in Ram-Dass, the Hindoo man-god. When asked what he meant to do for the sins of men, Ram-Dass at once made answer that he had fire enough in his belly to burn up all the sins of the world. Of this abdominal flame Pattison had not a spark. Nor had he that awful sense which no humanism could extinguish in Milton, of service as 'ever in the great Taskmaster's eye.' Nor had he, finally, that civil and secular enthusiasm which made men like Bentham and Mill into great workers and benefactors of their kind. Pattison was of the mind of Fra Paolo in a letter to Casaubon. 'As long as there are men there will be fanaticism. The wisest man has warned us not to expect the world ever to improve <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that <b>the</b> <b>better</b> part of mankind will be the majority. No wise man ever undertakes to correct the disorders of the public estate. He who cannot endure the madness of the public, but goeth about to think he can cure it, is himself no less mad than the rest. So, sing to yourself and the muses.'

40|$|This is {{the first}} of three {{chapters}} on designing and implementing graphical user-computer interfaces. As computers become cheaper and more powerful, the major bottleneck for further progress is not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> need for <b>better</b> hardware or software as <b>the</b> need for <b>better</b> com-munication between <b>the</b> computer and the human. For that reason, techniques for developing high-quality user interfaces are moving to the forefront in computer science and are becoming the &quot;last frontier &quot; in providing computing {{to a wide variety of}} usersâ€”as other aspects of tech-nology continue to improve, but the human users remain the same. Interest in the quality of user-computer interfaces is a recent part of the formal study of computers. The emphasis until the early 1980 s was on optimizing two scarce hardware resources, computer time and memory. Program efficiency was the highest goal. With todayâ€™s plummeting hardware costs and powerful graphics-oriented personal computing environments (as discussed in Chapter XXX_ 1 _XXX), the focus turns to optimizing user efficiency rather than computer efficiency. Thus, although many of the ideas presented in this chapter require additional CPU cycles and memory space, the potential rewards in user productivity and satis-faction well outweigh the modest additional cost of these resources...|$|R

60|$|There {{has taken}} place a great change in Ireland since the days in which I lived at Banagher, and a change <b>so</b> <b>much</b> for <b>the</b> <b>better,</b> that I have {{sometimes}} wondered at the obduracy with which people have spoken of the permanent ill condition of the country. Wages are now nearly double what they were then. The Post Office, at any rate, is paying almost double for its rural labour,--9s. a week when it used to pay 5s., and 12s. a week when it used to pay 7s. Banks {{have sprung up in}} almost every village. Rents are paid with more than English punctuality. And the religious enmity between the classes, though it is not yet dead, is dying out. Soon after I reached Banagher in 1841, I dined one evening with a Roman Catholic. I was informed next day by a Protestant gentleman who had been very hospitable to me that I must choose my party. I could not sit both at Protestant and Catholic tables. Such a caution would now be impossible in any part of Ireland. Home-rule, no doubt, is a nuisance,--and especially a nuisance because the professors of the doctrine do not at all believe it themselves. There are probably no other twenty men in England or Ireland who would be so utterly dumfounded and prostrated were Home-rule to have its way as the twenty Irish members who profess to support it in the House of Commons. But it is not to be expected that nuisances such as these should be abolished at a blow. Home-rule is, at any rate, better and more easily managed than the rebellion {{at the close of the}} last century; it is <b>better</b> than <b>the</b> treachery of the Union; less troublesome than O'Connell's monster meetings; less dangerous than Smith O'Brien and the battle of the cabbage-garden at Ballingary, and very much less bloody than Fenianism. The descent from O'Connell to Mr. Butt has been the natural declension of a political disease, which we had no right to hope would be cured by any one remedy.|$|R

5000|$|It was {{announced}} on 14 May 2011, that Laleh would be {{participating in the}} second season of TV4's popular Swedish reality television show [...] "SÃ¥ mycket bÃ¤ttre" [...] (<b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>better).</b> <b>The</b> announcement by the channel also confirmed that fellow Swedish artists, Timbuktu, Eva Dahlgren, Lena Philipsson, E-Type, Tomas Ledin and Mikael Wiehe would be participating. The program involves established artists living together for eight days on the Swedish island of Gotland. Each artist has a day dedicated to them, with the other artists attempting to produce a new interpretation {{of one of the}} singer's songs. The show, which is based on a Dutch format, [...] then sees the artists gather together {{at the end of the}} day around a dinner table to listen to what has been produced. You also get a glimpse of their time together. The show began filming on 11 June 2011. The show began broadcasting on TV4 across Sweden on 29 October 2011 and, for the first two episodes, worldwide on the channel's online catch-up service, TV4 Play. Her performances on the show were lauded by both critics and the public, with her first five performances topping the Swedish iTunes chart. Her rendition of Eva Dahlgren's [...] "Ã„ngeln i rummet" [...] became the highest peaking song on the Swedish Singles Chart released from the show's second season and was also nominated for [...] "Swedish Song of the Year" [...] at the Gaygalan Awards.

5000|$|The AllMusic {{review by}} FranÃ§ois Couture stated [...] "Braxton's Ghost Trance Music series {{ranks among the}} most {{difficult}} music to review. Everyone {{has his or her}} personal favorites among the dozens of discs released under this umbrella and, since the general idea underpinning them all and the quality of musicianship remain rather constant, evaluation comes down to highly subjective factors. For instance, one listener might find the first volume in Leo Records' Ninetet (Yoshi's) 1997 series lacking in interest, but would be hard pressed to rationally explain why this second installment, Ninetet (Yoshi's) 1997, Vol. 2 is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>better.</b> ... <b>The</b> music was recorded the day after the first volume, and consists once again of two disc-long pieces. The difference on Vol. 2 is that the group sounds more focused, more willing to trap the listener into the hypnotic patterns of the music and push him to the edge of free improvisation. [...] "Composition N. 210" [...] in particular deploys some mean tricks to make you forget that it is written down. The two pieces develop very different colors. Most noticeable is the fact that Norton (mostly) plays the drum kit in [...] "N. 210," [...] while he sticks to mallet percussion and cymbals in [...] "N. 209." [...] And so, either by design or attraction, [...] "N. 210" [...] displays a certain free jazz mood, prone to a certain frenzy, while [...] "N. 209" [...] slightly evokes contemporary classical music, especially in its delicate finale. Up to this point, the listener may be under the impression that GTM worked better with small groupings, but this set proves otherwise".|$|R
6000|$|It may be affirmed without extravagance {{that the}} free {{institutions}} we enjoy have developed the powers and improved the condition of our whole people beyond any example in the world. Of this {{we now have a}} striking and an impressive illustration. So large an army as the government has now on foot was never before known without a soldier in it but who has taken his place there of his own free choice. But more than this, there are many single regiments whose members, one and another, possess full practical knowledge of all the arts, sciences, professions, and whatever else, whether useful or elegant, is known in the world; and there is scarcely one from which there could not be selected a President, a Cabinet, a Congress, and perhaps a court, abundantly competent to administer the government itself. Nor do I say this is not true also in the army of our late friends, now adversaries in this contest; but if it is, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>the</b> reason why the government which has conferred such benefits on both them and us should not be broken up. Whoever in any section proposes to abandon such a government would do well to consider in deference to what principle it is that he does it; what better he is likely to get in its stead; whether the substitute will give, or be intended to give, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of good to the people. There are some foreshadowings on this subject. Our adversaries have adopted some declarations of independence in which, unlike the good old one, penned by Jefferson, they omit the words [...] "all men are created equal." [...] Why? They have adopted a temporary national constitution, in the preamble of which, unlike our good old one, signed by Washington, they omit [...] "We, the People," [...] and substitute, [...] "We, the deputies of the sovereign and independent States."

Full of anxious thought, he went to the apartment of Victor Lee, in which Joliffe told him he would find the party assembled. The sound of laughter, as he laid his hand on the lock of the door, almost made him start, so singularly did it jar with the doubtful and melancholy reflections which engaged his own mind. He entered, and found his father in high good-humour, laughing and conversing freely with his young charge, whose appearance was, indeed, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> changed to <b>the</b> <b>better</b> in externals, that it seemed scarce possible a night's rest, a toilet, and a suit of decent clothes, could have done <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in his favour in so short a time.

There was nothing splendid in that which Louis Kerneguy (we continue to call him by his assumed name) now wore. It was merely a riding-suit of grey cloth, with some silver lace, in the fashion of a country gentleman of the time. But it happened to fit him very well, and to become his very dark complexion, especially as he now held up his head, and used the manners, not only of a well-behaved but of a highly-accomplished gentleman. When he moved, his clumsy and awkward limp was exchanged for a sort of shuffle, which, as it might be the consequence of a wound in those perilous times, had rather an interesting than an ungainly effect.
