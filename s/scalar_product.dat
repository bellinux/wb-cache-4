Thus, at any instant, {{the rate of the}} work done by a force (measured in joules/second, or watts) is the <b>scalar</b> <b>product</b> of the force (a vector), and the velocity vector of the point of application. This <b>scalar</b> <b>product</b> of force and velocity is classified as instantaneous power. Just as velocities may be integrated over time to obtain a total distance, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, the total work along a path is similarly the time-integral of instantaneous power applied along the trajectory of the point of application.|$|E

25|$|All of {{the above}} {{correlation}} functions have been defined {{in the context of}} equilibrium statistical mechanics. However, it is possible to define correlation functions for systems away from equilibrium. Examining the general definition of , it is clear that one can define the random variables used in these correlation functions, such as atomic positions and spins, away from equilibrium. As such, their <b>scalar</b> <b>product</b> is well-defined away from equilibrium. The operation which is no longer well-defined away from equilibrium is the average over the equilibrium ensemble. This averaging process for non-equilibrium system is typically replaced by averaging the <b>scalar</b> <b>product</b> across the entire sample. This is typical in scattering experiments and computer simulations, and is often used to measure the radial distribution functions of glasses.|$|E

25|$|To measure {{distances}} and angles on manifolds, the manifold must be Riemannian. A 'Riemannian manifold' is a differentiable manifold {{in which each}} tangent space is equipped with an inner product ⟨⋅,⋅⟩ in a manner which varies smoothly from point to point. Given two tangent vectors u and v, the inner product ⟨u,v⟩ gives a real number. The dot (or <b>scalar)</b> <b>product</b> is a typical example of an inner product. This allows one to define various notions such as length, angles, areas (or volumes), curvature and divergence of vector fields.|$|E
25|$|In linear algebra, {{an inner}} product space is a vector space with an {{additional}} structure called an inner product. This additional structure associates each pair of vectors in the space with a scalar quantity known as the inner product of the vectors. Inner products allow the rigorous introduction of intuitive geometrical notions such as {{the length of a}} vector or the angle between two vectors. They also provide the means of defining orthogonality between vectors (zero inner product). Inner product spaces generalize Euclidean spaces (in which the inner product is the dot product, also known as the <b>scalar</b> <b>product)</b> to vector spaces of any (possibly infinite) dimension, and are studied in functional analysis.|$|E
