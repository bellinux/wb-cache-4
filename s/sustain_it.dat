5|$|In October1942, the 9thDivision and the RAAF squadrons in {{the area}} {{took part in the}} Second Battle of El Alamein. After a lengthy period of preparation, the Eighth Army {{launched}} its major offensive on 23October. The 9thDivision was involved in some of the heaviest fighting of the battle, and its advance in the coast area succeeded in drawing away enough German forces for the heavily reinforced 2ndNew Zealand Division to decisively break though the Axis lines on the night of 1/2November. The 9thDivision suffered a high number of casualties during this battle and did not take part in the pursuit of the retreating Axis forces. During the battle the Australian Government requested that the division be returned to Australia as {{it was not possible to}} provide enough reinforcements to <b>sustain</b> <b>it,</b> and this was agreed to by the British and US governments in late November. The 9thDivision left Egypt for Australia in January1943, ending the AIF's involvement in the war in North Africa.|$|E

25|$|Ruhama (Hebrew: Renewed life), {{established}} in 1989, is a Dublin-based NGO which {{works on a}} national level with women affected by prostitution and other forms of commercial sexual exploitation. The organisation regards prostitution as violence against women and violations of women's human rights. Ruhama sees prostitution and the social and cultural attitudes which <b>sustain</b> <b>it</b> as being deeply rooted in gender inequality and social marginalisation. Ruhama offers a range of services to support women in and exiting prostitution. Ruhama also seeks to highlight sex trafficking.|$|E
25|$|A revamped Family Feud {{returned}} for a seventh season in September 1994 with Dawson {{in his role as}} host.

Although Dawson did bring a brief ratings surge when he came back, the show could not <b>sustain</b> <b>it</b> long term and Feud came to a conclusion {{at the end of the}} 1994–95 season.|$|E
25|$|Maimonides wrote a responsum {{lifting the}} decree of Ezra, {{based on an}} opinion in the Talmud stating that it had failed to be {{observed}} {{by a majority of}} the community and the Jewish people found themselves unable to <b>sustain</b> <b>it.</b> However, Maimonides continued to follow the Keri restrictions as a matter of personal observance. Since then, observance of the rules of Keri and hence regular mikveh use by men fell into disuse in many communities. Hasidic Judaism, however, revived the practice of regular mikveh use, advocating regular daily mikveh use as a way of achieving spiritual purity. The growth of Hasidic Judaism resulted in a revival of mikveh use by men. In addition, some Sephardic and Mizrahi communities continued to observe the rules of keri throughout.|$|E

25|$|The Bellefonte & Buffalo Run and Nittany Valley & Southern were merged on March 16, 1885, to {{form the}} Buffalo Run, Bellefonte and Bald Eagle Railroad, under the {{presidency}} of James A. Beaver. The new company began to lay rail on the grade in April 1886, and began shipping ore from Lambourn Bank (near Waddle) to the McCoy & Linn furnace in Bellefonte in January 1887. The Collins brothers also invested in local ore banks, including those at Red Bank. This was reached by a branch from Mattern Junction, on the horseshoe curve near Waddle. To smelt the ore, they began building Bellefonte Furnace near the new railroad's enginehouse in Coleville, {{on the outskirts of}} Bellefonte. The furnace was put in blast on February 1, 1888, but the local supplies of ore proved insufficient to <b>sustain</b> <b>it</b> and it was shut down in February 1891. Part of the Red Bank Branch would be abandoned in 1894.|$|E
25|$|As a {{young man}} John Schofield was educated in the public schools, helped his family farm and build their home, and then {{surveyed}} land in northern Wisconsin before spending a year teaching school in Oneco, Illinois not far from Freeport. Then U.S. Rep. Thomas J. Turner secured John Schofield an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. He sold land for travel expenses and reported on June 1, 1849. In his final year at the Academy, while a teaching assistant in the mathematics section, cadet Schofield was accused of allowing others in his classroom to make offensive jokes and drawings on the blackboard. He was dismissed from West Point, but after meeting with Illinois' U.S. Senator Stephen A. Douglas, appealed the decision to the Secretary of War, who referred the matter back to a Board of Inquiry at the Academy. A majority of the review board voted to rescind the expulsion, {{but one of the}} two officers who voted to <b>sustain</b> <b>it,</b> cavalry and artillery instructor Lt. George H. Thomas, later became a commander of Schofield during the Civil War. Although Schofield's eventual memoirs did not mention Thomas on the review board, his persistent criticism of Thomas's generalship after the war may reflect this incident. Schofield graduated in 1853, ranking seventh in his class, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the artillery.|$|E

500|$|At the London {{conference that}} drew up the indictments of German war crimes before the Nuremberg trials, the Soviet negotiators put forward the allegation, [...] "In September 1941, 925 Polish {{officers}} who were prisoners of war {{were killed in the}} Katyn Forest near Smolensk". The U.S. negotiators agreed to include it, but were [...] "embarrassed" [...] by the inclusion (noting that the allegation had been debated extensively in the press) and concluded that it would be up to the Soviets to <b>sustain</b> <b>it.</b> At the trials in 1946, Soviet General Roman Rudenko raised the indictment, stating that [...] "one of the most important criminal acts for which the major war criminals are responsible was the mass execution of Polish prisoners of war shot in the Katyn forest near Smolensk by the German fascist invaders", but failed to make the case and the U.S. and British judges dismissed the charges. It was not the purpose of the court to determine whether Germany or the Soviet Union was responsible for the crime, but rather to attribute the crime to {{at least one of the}} defendants, which the court was unable to do.|$|E
500|$|The Christian Democrats, {{believing that}} the coup was merely a {{temporary}} measure, demanded that new elections to the Seimas be held, but Smetona stalled. He predicted that his party would not be popular {{and that he would}} not be re-elected president. In the meantime, the Nationalists were discussing constitutional changes that would increase the powers of the executive branch while curbing the powers of the Seimas. In April, a group of populists tried to organize a coup [...] "to defend the constitution," [...] but the plans were discovered and the rebels were arrested. Among the detainees was a member of the Seimas, Juozas Pajaujis. On 12 April 1927, the Seimas protested this arrest as a violation of the parliamentary immunity by delivering a motion of no confidence against the Voldemaras government. Smetona, using his constitutional right to do so, dissolved the Seimas. The constitution was violated, however, when no new elections were held within two months. In April, Christian Democratic newspapers, which had been calling for new elections, were censored. On 2 May 1927, Christian Democrats withdrew from the government, thinking that the Nationalists acting alone would not be able to <b>sustain</b> <b>it.</b> As a result, the Lithuanian National Union took the upper hand in its dispute with a much larger and influential rival and assumed the absolute control of the state.|$|E
