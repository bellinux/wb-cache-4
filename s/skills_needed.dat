It mentions the main methods used for assessing changing educational and training {{needs in the}} UK at various levels. The recent focus on local assessment of <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> in the UK has resulted in an explosion of research, with an immense number of detailed studies being undertaken. The chapter describes the changing institutional arrangements for identifying <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> and delivering education and training, and reviews the significance of such changes in the UK over recent years, focusing on both technical and institutional issues.

In doing this work we draw on surveys, interviews, focus groups and archival documents to build a rich and detailed perspective on <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> for the IT professionals at BigCo’s Corporate IT group. Findings show that there is an implicit set of conceptual IT skills that IT professionals are expected to have. Further, the non-IT <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> are presently very important and are expected to become even more important. Finally, there are important department-level, experience, and gender variations in the responses suggesting that IT roles are growing both more numerous and more specialized...|$|R
5|$|Even though peasant {{households}} {{were significantly}} smaller than aristocratic ones, the wealthiest of these would also employ servants.

5|$|Adventure {{was named}} after Colossal Cave Adventure. Robinett began {{designing}} the graphics-based game, loosely based on the text game, on a Hewlett-Packard 1611A microprocessor computer around May to June 1978. Robinett was aware early on that memory use {{was going to be}} critical: Atari 2600 cartridges had room for only 4096 bytes (4 KB) on the cartridge ROM, and 128 bytes for program variables in the 2600's RAM; in contrast, Colossal Cave Adventure took hundreds of kilobytes of memory. The final game used nearly all of the available memory (including 5% of the cartridge storage for Robinett's Easter egg), with 15 unused bytes from the ROM capacity. Robinett credits Ken Thompson, his professor at University of California Berkeley, with teaching him the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> to use the limited memory efficiently. Thompson had required his students to learn the C programming language; Robinett carried techniques from that language into his programming of Adventure.|$|E

40|$|Widening {{university}} {{participation is}} arguably {{one of the}} largest changes occurring within the contemporary university (Biggs and Tang 2011); with many universities offering enabling programs to provide a supported transition to university for students from equity groups. In order to better inform enabling program curriculum, 2012 commencing students at UniSA College were surveyed to determine the <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> they identified as important. These needs were compared to a known framework for university preparedness. There was found to be a significant match between the students’ identified <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> and Conley’s framework (2008) with regard to academic literacy. However other enabling program student identified <b>skill</b> <b>needs,</b> such as personal development, community input, and career preparation, were not supported by the framework. The research concludes that a separate framework should be determined for enabling program student <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> and that academics should engage in regular dialogue with students to develop curriculum which meets the specific needs of this growing cohort.

5|$|Both {{the title}} of the episode and the {{invocation}} spoken by the character of Sammael refer to four of the nine choirs of angels in Christian mythology. Christian angelology holds that there are three groupings of three choirs each. The Thrones are the third-highest ranking choir, belonging to the group charged with attending to God, and are described as stern incarnations of holy justice. Dominions, the fourth-highest choir, belong to the group appointed to deal with God's creations. Dominions lead the lower orders and impart wisdom to humanity. Powers belong to the same tier as Dominions, and are tasked with countering the threat of temptation by the devil and demons. Principalities are the seventh-highest ranking choir and belong to the lowest grouping of angels, those most likely to appear to mankind. Principalities oversee those humans who rule over others, teaching kings and heads of families the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> to lead.|$|E
5|$|Counseling {{about sex}} and {{sexuality}} by medical professionals, psychologists, social workers, and nurses {{is a part of}} most SCI rehabilitation programs. Education is part of the follow-up treatment for people with SCI, as are psychotherapy, peer mentorship, and social activities; these are helpful for improving <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> for socializing and relationships. Rather than addressing sexual dysfunction strictly as a physical problem, appropriate sexual rehabilitation care takes into account the individual as a whole, for example addressing issues with relationships and self-esteem. Sexual counseling includes teaching techniques to manage depression and stress, and to increase attention to preserved sensations during sexual activity. Education includes information about birth control or assistive devices such as those for positioning in sex, or advice and ideas for addressing problems such as incontinence and autonomic dysreflexia.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta's exact date {{of birth}} is not known, as birth records were not {{traditionally}} kept by the Kikuyu. It is known that he was probably born sometime in the 1890s. The Kikuyu custom {{at the time was}} to divide boys into age groups, in which they would be initiated into manhood together. The older members of Kenyatta's age group are believed to have been born around 1890. One biographer, Jules Archer, suggested that his year of birth was likely 1890, although a fuller analysis performed by Jeremy Murray-Brown concluded that he was likely born circa 1897 or 1898. Kenyatta was raised according to traditional Kikuyu custom and religious belief, and was taught the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> to herd the family flock. When he was ten years old, his earlobes were pierced to mark his transition away from childhood.|$|E

5|$|Japan's {{education}} system {{played a central}} part in the country's recovery and rapid {{economic growth in the}} decades following the end of World War II. After World War II, the Fundamental Law of Education and the School Education Law were enacted. The latter law defined the school system that would be in effect for many decades: six years of elementary school, three years of junior high school, three years of high school, and two or four years of university. Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program, in hopes to mitigate bullying and truancy; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide in the coming years. In Japan, having a strong educational background greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money to support oneself. Highly educated individuals are less affected by unemployment trends as higher levels of educational attainment make an individual more attractive in the workforce. The lifetime earnings also increase with each level of education attained. Furthermore, <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> in the modern 21st century labor market are becoming more knowledge-based and strong aptitude in science and mathematics are more strong predictors of employment prospects in Japan's highly technological economy.|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{one might argue}} that no {{relationship}} rather than a negative relationship should be observed, if training was actually used to reduce turnover rather than reduced by turnover. This is, because rising turnover rates would then cause firms to provide CVT to bring back down turnover rates, making it difficult to observe any clear relationship in a cross-sectional data. Also, one could reason that, indeed, poaching may be of greater influence for firms with low <b>skill</b> <b>needs,</b> because it is feasible to do without CVT in such firms, whereas CVT may be indispensable when <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> are high. In other words: when CVT is less crucial to firm productivity, employers might react more sensitively to changes in turnover. Thus, even though descriptive figures on employers’ (non-)training motives do not point at turnover being perceived as a constraint to CVT in the majority of firms, some firms with relatively low <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> may actually abandon CVT because of staff fluctuation.|$|R

In ancient times, this often meant that a king needed to lead his armies in person to be certain his commands were timely and followed, {{as in the case of}} Alexander the Great (356-323 BCE). At that time, the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> to lead troops in battle were as important as the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> to run a country during peacetime.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I use {{data from a}} recent survey of {{employers}} to investigate the effects of employer <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> on the wage levels and employment of newly hired workers, and especially on how these outcomes differ by race and gender. The <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> are measured by various human capital credentials required of applicants at the hiring stage (educational attainment, specific experience, prior training) and by the daily task performance of those who are newly hired (reading/writing, arithmetic, use of computers). The results show that few new jobs are available to those workers who lack most of these credentials or who cannot perform most of these tasks. This is true even of jobs that do not require applicants to have college degrees. The hiring and task performance requirements of new jobs are associated with lower employment levels of blacks relative to whites within each gender, and some tasks are associated with higher employment levels of females relative to males. These requirements also have significant effects on starting hourly wages. Both effects are found even after controlling for the educational attainments of hired workers. The effects of employer <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> on employment patterns and wages help to account for some of the observed differences across groups in hourly wages, especially between black and white males, after controlling for education. Recent trends over time in relative wages and employment across these groups also seem to be quite consistent with these findings, along with evidence that these <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> have been rising among employers. In addition, I find that various other employer characteristics such as their size, location, and the racial composition of their clientele also have significant effects on their tendencies to hire blacks. These findings suggest that employer preferences across racial groups play some role in determining employment outcomes of these groups, even after controlling for <b>skill</b> <b>needs.</b> ...|$|R
