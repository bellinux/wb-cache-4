50|$|Sealed beam {{headlamps}} {{were introduced}} in the United States in 1939, and became mandatory from the following year until the 1984 model year.

Halogen sealed beam headlamps appeared on U.S. cars in 1978 to enable halogen technology under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, which at the time required all headlamps to be of sealed beam construction; eventually halogen sealed beams came to dominate the <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lamp</b> market.|$|E

5000|$|In stage lighting, <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lamps</b> {{are often}} used. A common size, {{also used in}} rock concerts, as well as outdoor {{architectural}} lighting, is the parabolic aluminized reflector 64 (PAR64).

50|$|A <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> {{is a type}} of lamp with a {{parabolic}} reflector, one or more filaments, and a {{glass or}} polycarbonate lens sealed permanently together as a unit.

Halogen <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lamps</b> incorporate a halogen lamp within a quartz or hard glass envelope.|$|R
50|$|The {{light source}} was two stacks of <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lamps,</b> {{installed}} on a revolving table. It had {{red and green}} sectors.

50|$|The Round Island Lighthouse was {{constructed}} in 1895 to mark the southern side of the Round Island Channel. In 1936, the United States Coast Guard developed plans to construct another lighthouse, 1000 feet south of Mackinac Island, to mark the northern side of the navigable channel. However, World War II intervened, and construction was delayed. In the interim, a buoy with a radio beacon was moored near the site. The Coast Guard began construction on the Round Island Passage Light in 1947, and finished in 1948. Construction included building a control house at the southern tip on Mackinac Island, and running power cables underwater to the light. The lighthouse was equipped with a beacon light, fog signal, and radiobeacon. The light flashed a green signal from an array of <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lamps</b> mounted {{at the top of}} the light tower.|$|R
500|$|To improve {{confidence}} in the approach, the project made a prototype {{in the form of}} a counter-illuminated plywood silhouette of a Liberator at life size, suspended from towers [...] at a point where it could be seen from a point a little above sea level [...] away across Oyster Bay, Long Island, so that it was seen mainly over water as a sea search aircraft would be from a submarine's conning tower. It was fitted with <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lamps</b> made by General Electric. The lamps had reflectors to give them a narrow beam of 3 degrees horizontally, 6 degrees vertically, to minimise power consumption for the required brightness. The lamps' brightness was controllable with a variable resistor. During a test in the winter of 1943, selecting a day when the visibility was above 2 miles and the wind not so strong as to destroy the prototype, the observers could clearly see the [...] thick cables used to hold up the model, but the silhouette itself was [...] "completely invisible" [...] with the lamps correctly adjusted.|$|R
50|$|The car was {{available}} as a two-door sedan (replacing the aging rear-engined, rear-wheel drive Volkswagen Beetle 2-door sedan in the United States and Canada) and four-door sedan body styles, both of which shared a traditional three-box design. Like the Volkswagen Golf Mk1, its angular styling was penned at ItalDesign, by Giorgetto Giugiaro. Styling differences could be found depending on the market. In most of the world, the car {{was available}} with composite headlamps, while in the USA, it was only available with rectangular <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lamps</b> due to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108 (FMVSS 108). The suspension setup was identical to the Golf and consisted of a MacPherson strut setup in front and a twist-beam rear suspension. It shared its 2,400 mm (94.5 in) wheelbase with its hatchback counterpart, although overall length was up by 380 millimetres (15 in). The capacity of the luggage compartment was 377 litres (13.3 ft3), making the Jetta reasonably practical. To distinguish the car from the Golf, interiors were made more upscale in all markets. This included velour seating and color coordinated sill to sill carpeting.|$|R

25|$|In May 1966 the Australian Government, {{responding}} to {{the changing nature of}} international shipping, granted permission for the Queensland Government to construct a composite structure comprising lighthouse, signal station and radar station, on the lighthouse reserve at Caloundra Head. The new structure was part of a pilot station scheme based at the Mooloolah River, and was to serve as a guide to the North West Channel and a signal light for Caloundra Harbour. Fully completed and operational by 1968, the new lighthouse was erected close to the 1896 lighthouse and for a time the two towers stood side by side. Constructed in reinforced concrete, the new lighthouse resembled an airport control tower. A new light that used a revolving table and comprised two stacks of <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lamps</b> was designed and installed. It was manned 24 hours a day and four houses were built outside the reserve to accommodate the staff and their families. A similar signal station tower was constructed at Lytton Hill, making the Caloundra tower one of only two of this type built in Australia. With the Lytton Hill tower being demolished in the 1990s, the Caloundra tower remains the only surviving example.|$|R
25|$|Raylite reflectors can {{be added}} to PAR64 and PAR56 lamp {{housings}} to achieve a narrow spot effect. A conventional quartz halogen lamp is used in place of the reflector lamp. A spider or bulb shield may optionally be added, which enhances the parallel nature of the beam and makes it more visible when used with smoke or fog effects. Raylites are generally less rugged than <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> bulbs. The <b>lamp</b> can easily shake loose of the lampholder in transit.|$|R
25|$|Parabolic Aluminized Reflector lights, or PAR lights, or PAR cans, {{are used}} when a {{substantial}} amount of flat lighting is required for a scene. A PAR can is a <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> PAR <b>lamp</b> housed in a simple can-like unit. Like an old-fashioned automotive headlight, the reflector is integral to the <b>lamp</b> and the <b>beam</b> spread of the unit is not adjustable except by changing the lamp. PAR lamps are widely used in architectural lighting and may often be found at hardware stores. PAR lights have seen heavy use in rock and roll shows, especially those with smaller budgets, due to their low cost, light weight, easy maintenance, high durability, and high output. They are often used in combination with smoke or haze machines which make the path of the beam visible. They are also often used as top, back, or side lights in the theatre and for special effects.|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} EU funded {{research}} project THERMPROTECT ('Thermal properties of protective clothing and their use') this paper deals with manikin experiments {{on the effects of}} heat radiation at different wind speeds, considering aspects related to the reflectivity of the clothing. A heated thermal manikin 'Newton' was operated with a constant surface temperature of 34 °C standing in a climatic chamber. The manikin was placed in a wind tunnel, with fans sucking the air through the tunnel and the manikin facing the wind and the radiation. To ensure proper operation of the manikins heating mechanism the experiments were carried out at a low air temperature (Ta) of 6 °C with 50 % relative humidity. Four wind speeds (0. 5 m/s, 1. 0 m/s, 2. 0 m/s and 5. 0 m/s) were used. The manikin wore four different outer wears (Black Laminated Nomex, Black Nomex, Orange Nomex and Reflective Nomex). All clothing had equal design. Identical underwear was worn in all trials (Helly Hansen super bodywear). Two THORN compact high intensity floodlight for PAR 64 <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> CSI <b>lamps</b> were used in the tests as the radiant source. Lamps were set at a distance of 1. 5 metres away from the manikin for high radiation level (± 450 W/m 2) and 2. 0 meters for medium level (± 325 W/m 2). The results showed a decrease in whole body heat loss, i. e. heat gain for the conditions with radiant heat stress compared to the reference without radiation. With wind, the heat gain decreased. Except for the reflective suit, the influence of the material and colour of the outer garment on radiant heat gains was negligible. The reflective suit showed the lowest heat gain. Increased heat loss by wind compensated for the radiant heat gains, with an effect size similar for all suits up to 2 m/s wind. Above this speed the wind effect on the reflective suit was smaller than for the others.
