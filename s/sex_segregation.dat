25|$|Atatürk was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of coeducation and the education of girls. Coeducation was established as the norm throughout the educational system by 1927. Centuries of <b>sex</b> <b>segregation</b> under Ottoman rule had denied girls equal education, Atatürk thus opposed segregated education as a matter of principle. The matter of coeducation was first raised {{as a result of a}} controversy in Tekirdağ in 1924, where, due to the lack of a high school for girls, girls requested enrollment in the high school for boys. Upon this, works on coeducation began and the Minister of Education declared that both sexes would follow the same curriculum. In August 1924, it was decided that coeducation would be introduced to primary education, giving boys the right to enroll in girls' high schools and vice versa. Atatürk declared in his Kastamonu speech in 1925 that coeducation should be the norm. Whilst the educational committee had agreed in 1926 to abolish single-sex education in middle schools that were not boarding schools, segregation persisted in middle and high schools, and statistics in the 1927–28 educational year revealed that only 29% of those enrolled in primary schools were girls. This figure was 18.9% for middle schools and 28% for high schools. Acting on these figures, 70 single-sex middle schools were converted to coeducational schools in 1927–28 and new coeducational middle schools were established. This was despite the opposition of Köprülüzade Fuat Bey, the Undersecretary for Education. Whilst the policy was transition to coeducational high schools based on the success in middle schools from 1928–29 onwards this policy could only be implemented effectively from 1934–35 onwards.|$|E

It {{is less clear}} how homolog associations are maintained in organisms that lack recombination, such as male Drosophila. In lieu of chiasmata and synaptonemal complexes, there must be molecules that balance poleward forces exerted across homologous centromeres. Here we describe the genetic and cytological characterization of four EMS-induced mutations in teflon (tef), a gene involved in this process in Drosophila melanogaster. All four alleles are male specific and cause meiosis I-specific nondisjunction of the autosomes. They do not measurably perturb <b>sex</b> chromosome <b>segregation,</b> suggesting that {{there are differences in}} the genetic control of autosome and <b>sex</b> chromosome <b>segregation</b> in males. Meiotic transmission of univalent chromosomes is unaffected in tef mutants, implicating the tef product in a pairing-dependent process. The segregation of translocations between sex chromosomes and autosomes is altered in tef mutants in a manner that supports this hypothesis. Consistent with these genetic observations, cytological examination of meiotic chromosomes suggests a role of tef in regulating or mediating pairing of autosomal bivalents at meiosis I. We discuss implications of this finding in regard to the evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes and the mechanisms that ensure chromosome disjunction in the absence of recombination...|$|R

Two models to explain these results are considered. One is a competitive model that proposes that all chromosomes must compete for a scarce chromosome-binding material in Xh- males. The failure to observe competitive interactions among chromosome recovery probabilities rules out this model. The second is a pairing model which holds that normal spermiogenesis requires X-Y pairing at special heterochromatic pairing sites. Unsaturated pairing sites become gametic lethals. This model fails to account for autosomal sensitivity to meiotic drive. It is also contradicted by evidence that saturation of Y-pairing sites fails to suppress meiotic drive in Xh- males and that extra X-pairing sites in an otherwise normal male do not induce drive.

Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of sexual segregation in ungulates, but all are reducible {{to the influence of}} two factors: body size and sex-specific reproductive strategy.

Kangaroos represent a parallel radiation of terrestrial herbivores, but their populations are composed of a spectrum of adult body sizes, ranging from small males the same size as females to large males more than twice the size. We exploited this heteromorphism to assess the independent influences of size and sex in these ungulate analogues. We conducted a preliminary study of western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) in north-western Victoria, Australia. Adult males predominately occupied grassland habitat, whereas females occurred mostly in lakebed, woodland and shrubland.

40|$|Objective: Men {{who have}} sex with men (MSM) {{practice}} role segregation – insertive or receptive only sex positions instead of a versatile role- in several international settings where candidate biomedical HIV prevention interventions (e. g., circumcision, anal microbicide) will be tested. The effects of these position-specific interventions on HIV incidence are modeled. Materials and Methods: We developed a deterministic compartmental model to predict HIV incidence among Indian MSM using data from 2003 – 2010. The model’s sex mixing matrix was derived from network data of Indian MSM (n = 4604). Our model captures changing distribution of sex roles over time. We modeled microbicide and circumcision efficacy on trials with heterosexuals. Results: Increasing numbers of versatile MSM resulted in little change in HIV incidence over 20 years. Anal microbicides and circumcision would decrease the HIV prevalence at 10 years from 15. 6 % to 12. 9 % and 12. 7 % respectively. Anal microbicides would provide similar protection to circumcision at the population level despite lower modeled efficacy (54 % and 60 % risk reduction, respectively).

We show here that both meiotic prophase timing and germ-line apoptosis, one output of checkpoint signaling, are dictated by {{the sex of the}} germ line (oogenesis vs. spermatogenesis) in Caenorhabditis elegans. During oogenesis in feminized animals (fem- 3), a single pair of asynapsed autosomes elicits a checkpoint response, yet an unpaired X chromosome fails to induce checkpoint activation. The single X in males and fem- 3 worms is a substrate for the meiotic recombination machinery and repair of the resulting double strand breaks appears to be delayed compared with worms carrying paired X chromosomes. Synaptonemal complex axial HORMA domain proteins, implicated in repair of meiotic double strand breaks (DSBs) and checkpoint function, are assembled and disassembled on the single X similarly to paired chromosomes, but the central region component, SYP- 1, is not loaded on the X chromosome in males. In fem- 3 worms some X chromosomes achieve nonhomologous self-synapsis; however, germ cells with SYP- 1 -positive X chromosomes are not preferentially protected from apoptosis. Analyses of chromatin and X-linked gene expression indicate that a single X, unlike asynapsed X chromosomes or autosomes, maintains repressive chromatin marks and remains transcriptionally silenced and suggests that this state locally precludes checkpoint signaling...|$|R

Grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), like many large mammals, are sexually size dimorphic. In size dimorphic species, allometric differences in morphology, metabolic rate and reproductive costs are likely. Such differences may require the sexes to use different foraging strategies or different habitats. To investigate sexual segregation of habitat in grey seals, we used satellite tracks from 95 (male 46; female 49) adults breeding at Sable Island, Nova Scotia (44 [*]°N, 60 [*]°W) collected from 1995 to 2005.

Differences were most pronounced just before (October–December) and immediately after breeding (February–March). During both periods, males primarily used areas along the continental shelf break, while females mainly used mid-shelf regions. Coupled with previously identified sex-specific seasonal patterns of energy storage, diving and diet, our findings suggest that males and females differ profoundly in their spatial foraging strategies.
