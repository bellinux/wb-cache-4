5|$|The Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick {{announced}} on 25 July that a law forbidding marriages between Jews and non-Jews would shortly be promulgated, and recommended that registrars <b>should</b> <b>avoid</b> issuing licenses for such marriages {{for the time}} being. The draft law also called for a ban on marriage for persons with hereditary illnesses.|$|E
5|$|In September, Paul {{stated that}} the United States <b>should</b> <b>avoid</b> {{military}} intervention in the ongoing Syrian Civil War.

50|$|Drugs {{listed on}} the Beers List are {{categorized}} according to risks for bad outcomes. The tables include medications that have cautions, <b>should</b> be <b>avoided,</b> <b>should</b> be <b>avoided</b> with concomitant medical conditions, and are contraindicated and relatively contraindicated in the elderly population. An example of an included drug is diphenhydramine (Benadryl), a first generation H1 antagonist with anticholinergic properties, which may increase sedation and lead to confusion or falls.|$|R

5|$|Ability {{of judges}} to balance {{competing}} policy considerations. Where the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, judges may be ill-equipped to decide {{because of their}} limited training, experience and access to materials. Thus, the courts <b>should</b> <b>avoid</b> reviewing the merits of such executive decisions. This was mentioned in GCHQ where Lord Diplock held {{that the type of}} evidence admissible in the judicial process {{and the way in which}} it is adduced tends to exclude from the attention of the court competing policy considerations which need to be weighed against one another.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of similar}} and {{additive}} effects, divers <b>should</b> <b>avoid</b> sedating medications and drugs, such as marijuana and alcohol before any dive. A hangover, {{combined with the}} reduced physical capacity that goes with it, makes nitrogen narcosis more likely. Experts recommend total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving, and longer for other drugs. Abstinence time needed for marijuana is unknown, but owing to the much longer half-life of the active agent of this drug in the body, {{it is likely to}} be longer than for alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause {{respiratory}} depression in susceptible individuals. For that reason, they are contraindicated {{in people with}} myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea, bronchitis, and COPD. Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used in people with personality disorders or intellectual disability because of frequent paradoxical reactions. In major depression, they may precipitate suicidal tendencies and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses. Individuals {{with a history of}} alcohol, opioid and barbiturate abuse <b>should</b> <b>avoid</b> benzodiazepines, as there is a risk of life-threatening interactions with these drugs.|$|E

5|$|It {{appears that}} after this first wave of {{destruction}} a short-lived revival of Mycenaean culture followed. Mycenaean Greece continues to be mentioned in international affairs, particularly in Hittite records. In c. 1220 BC, the king of Ahhiyawa is again reported to {{have been involved in}} an anti-Hittite uprising in western Anatolia. Another contemporary Hittite account reports that Ahhiyawan ships <b>should</b> <b>avoid</b> Assyrian-controlled harbors, as part of a trade embargo imposed on Assyria. In general, {{in the second half of}} 13th century BC, trade was in decline in the Eastern Mediterranean, most probably due to the unstable political environment there.|$|E
5|$|Programs {{to prevent}} the {{vertical}} transmission of HIV (from mothers to children) can reduce rates of transmission by 92–99%. This primarily {{involves the use of}} a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding. If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe, mothers <b>should</b> <b>avoid</b> breastfeeding their infants; however exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case. If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out, the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of transmission. In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.|$|E
5|$|Rebirth and {{realms of}} {{existence}} are foundational teachings of Mahavira. According to the Acaranga Sutra, Mahavira comprehended life {{to exist in}} myriad forms, such as animals, plants, insects, water bodies, fire bodies, wind bodies, elemental forms, and others. He taught that a monk <b>should</b> <b>avoid</b> touching or disturbing {{any one of them}} including plants, never swim in water, nor light a fire or extinguish it, nor thrash their arms in the air as such actions can torment or hurt other beings that live in those states of matter.|$|E

5|$|The Upanishad {{suggests}} {{breathing exercises}} {{in a variety}} of ways, such as breathing with one nostril and exhaling with another, asserting that a regular practice multiple times a day cleans up the Nadis (blood vessels), improves digestive powers, stamina, leanness and causes the skin to glow. The text recommends restraining oneself from salt, mustard, acidic foods, spicy astringent pungent foods. The text also states that the yoga student <b>should</b> <b>avoid</b> fasting, early morning baths, sexual intercourse, and sitting near fire. Milk and ghee (clarified butter), cooked wheat, green gram and rice are foods the text approves of, in verses 46–49. The Upanishad also recommends massage, particularly areas of body that tremor or profusely perspire during the practice of yoga.|$|E
5|$|It is {{suggested}} that people <b>should</b> <b>avoid</b> jack jumpers, but this is difficult to do. Closed footwear (boots and shoes) along with socks reduce the chances of encountering a sting, but wearing thongs or sandals will put the person at risk. With this said, they are still capable of stinging through fabric, and can find their way through gaps in clothing. Most stings occur when people are gardening, so taking extra caution or avoiding gardening altogether is recommended. People can also avoid encountering jack jumpers by moving to locations where jack jumper populations are either low or absent, or eliminate nearby nests. Since Myrmecia ants have different venoms, people who are allergic to them are advised {{to stay away from}} all Myrmecia ants, especially to ones they have not encountered before.|$|E
5|$|The Europeans {{were also}} {{concerned}} about the long-term goals of the Mongols. Early Mongol diplomacy had been not a simple offer of cooperation, but straightforward demands for submission. It was only in later communications that Mongol diplomats started to adopt a more conciliatory tone; but they still used language that implied more command than entreaty. Even the Armenian historian Hayton of Corycus, the most enthusiastic advocate of Western-Mongol collaboration, freely admitted that the Mongol leadership was not inclined to listen to European advice. His recommendation was that even if working together, European armies and Mongol armies <b>should</b> <b>avoid</b> contact because of Mongol arrogance. European leaders were aware that the Mongols would not have been content to stop at the Holy Land, but were on a clear quest for world domination. If the Mongols had achieved a successful alliance with the West and destroyed the Mamluk Sultanate, they certainly would have eventually turned upon the Franks of Cyprus and the Byzantines. They also would have surely conquered Egypt, from which they could have continued an advance into Africa, where no strong state could have stood in their way until Morocco and the Islamic caliphates in the Maghreb.|$|E

5|$|Viv wakes to find Bond gone, {{leaving a}} note in which he {{promises}} to send her police assistance and which he concludes by telling her not to dwell {{too much on the}} ugly events through which she has just lived. As Viv finishes reading the note, a large police detachment arrives. After taking her statement, the officer in charge of the detail reiterates Bond's advice, but also warns Viv that all men involved in violent crime and espionage, regardless of which side they are on—including Bond himself—are dangerous and that Viv <b>should</b> <b>avoid</b> them. Viv reflects on this as she motors off {{at the end of the}} book, continuing her tour of America, but despite the officer's warning still devoted to the memory of the spy who loved her.|$|E
5|$|When Metternich {{returned}} to Vienna in October 1810, {{he was no}} longer as popular. His influence was limited to foreign affairs, and his attempts to get a full Council of State reintroduced had failed. Convinced that a much weakened Austria <b>should</b> <b>avoid</b> another invasion by France, he rejected the advances of Tsar Alexander and instead concluded an alliance with Napoleon on 14 March 1812. He also supported a period of moderate censorship, aimed at preventing provocation of the French. Requiring that only 30,000 Austrian troops fight alongside the French, the alliance treaty was more generous than the one Prussia had signed a month earlier; this allowed Metternich to give both Britain and Russia assurances that Austria remained committed to curbing Napoleonic ambitions. He accompanied his sovereign for a final meeting with Napoleon at Dresden in May 1812 before Napoleon embarked upon the French invasion of Russia.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese of the Tang era {{were also}} very {{interested}} in the benefits of officially classifying all of the medicines used in pharmacology. In 657, Emperor Gaozong of Tang (r. 649–683) commissioned the literary project of publishing an official materia medica, complete with text and illustrated drawings for 833 different medicinal substances taken from different stones, minerals, metals, plants, herbs, animals, vegetables, fruits, and cereal crops. In addition to compiling pharmacopeias, the Tang fostered learning in medicine by upholding imperial medical colleges, state examinations for doctors, and publishing forensic manuals for physicians. Authors of medicine in the Tang include Zhen Chuan (d. 643) and Sun Simiao (581–682), the former who first identified in writing that patients with diabetes had an excess of sugar in their urine, and the latter who was the first to recognize that diabetic patients <b>should</b> <b>avoid</b> consuming alcohol and starchy foods. As written by Zhen Chuan and others in the Tang, the thyroid glands of sheep and pigs were successfully used to treat goiters; thyroid extracts were not used to treat patients with goiter in the West until 1890. The use of the dental amalgam, manufactured from tin and silver, was first introduced in the medical text Xinxiu Bencao written by Su Gong in 659.|$|E
