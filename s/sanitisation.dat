In education, research showed {{that a large number}} of Model Secondary and Primary Schools were not finished and had been abandoned. The management of oil spillages in Rivers State, a catalyst for youth restiveness, was seen as ineffective across local governments in the State. Survey respondents reported that funds which ought to have gone into cleaning and <b>sanitisation</b> of their communities were diverted by local officials. These findings also support press reports about corruption in government allocations to oil producing areas. In the area of health, there is widespread disenchantment about the lack of improvement within the sector. Weak health service delivery in Rivers State is forcing many patients to seek medical attention at unregulated traditional medicine shops. Challenges associated to HIV/AIDS, the lack of qualified health professionals, and unfinished health projects, are serious concerns among respondents.

50|$|At {{the end of}} May 2006, 250 people, {{including}} 18 crew, {{were affected}} by a norovirus. Evidence of a gastrointestinal virus had been found {{during the last two}} days of the previous cruise, but the company stated that it did not believe the two outbreaks to be linked. The passengers were notified of this occurrence by a letter found in their cabins after boarding. Although the ship's itinerary had been altered, and the vessel ordered to dock away from other vessels, no other countermeasures were effected. Sea Princess returned to port in Southampton a day early, and the vessel underwent a complete <b>sanitisation</b> and decontamination before resuming cruising. Passengers were offered a 30% refund and a £150 voucher for use on a later Princess cruise; some demanded a full refund. A norovirus outbreak occurred again on the following cruise, although to a lesser extent, and visible precautions included waiter service at the buffets and the absence of salt and pepper shakers. This cruise was also affected by force 11-12 winds in the vicinity of Ushant, causing the first scheduled port to be missed, while the remaining itinerary remained unaltered. The ship was undamaged, the nearby Legend of the Seas suffered broken windows, and Pride of Bilbao terminated her Spain-bound voyage in France due to storm damage. It is likely that the rough seas caused increased use of the handrails, contributing to the difficulty of eradicating norovirus.|$|E
40|$|The paper aims to {{determine}} how the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) could be read in harmony with Article 29 Working Party’s Opinion on anonymisation techniques. To this end, based on an interdisciplinary methodology, a common terminology to capture the novel elements enshrined in the GDPR is built, and, a series of key concepts (i. e. <b>sanitisation</b> techniques, contextual controls, local linkability, global linkability, domain linkability) followed by a set of definitions for three types of data emerging from the GDPR are introduced. Importantly, two initial assumptions are made: 1) the notion of identifiability (i. e. being identified or identifiable) is used consistently across the GDPR (e. g. Article 4 and Recital 26); 2) the Opinion on Anonymisation Techniques is still good guidance as regards the classification of re-identification risks and the description of <b>sanitisation</b> techniques. It is suggested that even if these two premises seem to lead to an over-restrictive approach, this holds true as long as contextual controls are not combined with <b>sanitisation</b> techniques. Yet, contextual controls have been conceived as complementary to <b>sanitisation</b> techniques by the drafters of the GDPR. The paper concludes that the GDPR is compatible with a risk-based approach when contextual controls are combined with <b>sanitisation</b> techniques...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The role of {{bacteria}} in meibomian gland dysfunction is unclear, yet contamination of compresses used as treatment may exacerbate this condition. This study therefore determined {{the effect of}} heating on bacteria on two forms of compress. METHODS: Cotton flannels and MGDRx EyeBags (eyebags) were inoculated by adding experimental inoculum (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; one species for each set of 3 eyebags and flannels). One of each were then randomised in to 3 groups: no heating (control); therapeutic (47. 4 ± 0. 7 °C); or <b>sanitisation</b> (68 ± 1. 1 °C). After treatment, bacteria cell numbers were calculated. The experiment was repeated in triplicate. RESULTS: There was {{a statistically significant difference}} between each treatment with the eyebag for S. aureus (control= 7. 15 ± 0. 11 logC/ml, therapeutic heating= 5. 24 ± 0. 59 logC/ml, <b>sanitisation</b> heating= 3. 48 ± 1. 43 logC/ml; P< 0. 001) and S. pyogenes (7. 36 ± 0. 13, 5. 73 ± 0. 26, 4. 75 ± 0. 54; P< 0. 001). P. aeruginosa also showed a significant reduction (P< 0. 001) from control (6. 39 ± 0. 34) to therapeutic (0. 33 ± 0. 26) and <b>sanitisation</b> (0. 33 ± 0. 21), but the latter were similar (P= 1. 000). For the flannels, there was significant difference between each treatment for S. aureus (6. 89 ± 0. 46, 3. 96 ± 1. 76, 0. 42 ± 0. 90; P< 0. 001). For S. pyogenes, there was a significant reduction (P< 0. 001) from control (7. 51 ± 0. 10) to therapeutic (5. 91 ± 0. 62) and <b>sanitisation</b> (5. 18 ± 0. 8), but the latter were similar (P= 0. 07). For P. aeruginosa, {{there was a significant difference}} (P< 0. 001) from control (7. 15 ± 0. 36) to <b>sanitisation</b> (5. 83 ± 0. 44); but not to therapeutic (6. 84 ± 0. 31) temperatures (P= 0. 07). CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic heating produces a significant reduction in bacteria on the eyebags, but only <b>sanitisation</b> heating appears effective for flannels.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of different intensities and durations of ultrasound on the composition, oxidation, cheese-making properties and sensory traits of raw milk. Moreover, {{the effects of the}} addition of CO 2 and HCl prior to the sonication were tested to determine whether these chemicals could reduce the production of off-flavours. Treating milk with ultrasound led to certain changes in milk composition. We observed significant increases in free fatty acid levels, oxidation, and decreases in somatic cell count and pH; improved coagulation traits were also observed. The results of sensory evaluations revealed a significant increase in a burnt off-flavour with increasing intensity and duration of the ultrasound treatment. The addition of CO 2 appeared to significantly reduce the disruptive effect of ultrasound, the formation of oxidation products and the detection of the burnt off-flavour, whereas the sour flavour was increased. Industrial relevance: Among the new technologies that are used to improve milk <b>sanitisation</b> and shelf life, ultrasound treatment has been demonstrated to inactivate many bacterial species and to be a viable <b>sanitisation</b> procedure. In this study the milk coagulation properties of sonicated milk were dramatically improved following the ultrasound (US) treatments, indicating a possible use for US in the cheese-making industry. Moreover, despite the evident production of off-flavours caused by US in milk, the use of CO 2 to reduce pyrolytic processes and thus the formation of oxidation products, appeared to be promising with respect to the increased use of sonication on food and other organic matrices...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{two decades}} the web became a {{standard}} framework for Internet applications. This involved changing from an initially simple hypermedia access platform {{to a complex}} blob of different technologies. This complexity associated to the increasing filtering of TCP/UDP ports everywhere in the Internet, turned web applications into favourite targets for cyber-criminals. The Web Application Protection (WAP) tool aims to secure web applications by analysing and automatically fixing their source code [1] 1. WAP currently handles PHP code, in which most web applications are written. As of April 2014, WAP {{has been used to}} process more than 1. 5 million lines of code. This short paper briefly presents the tool and ongoing work on evolving it. I. THE WAP APPROACH The WAP approach brings to source code analysis a tension observed in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). These systems have been classified in two main categories. Knowledge-based IDSs contain a database of attack signatures created manually by human beings. Behaviour-based IDSs, on the contrary, learn about attacks – or normal behaviour – automatically using labelled data sets. Our approach uses a hybrid of two analog approaches. WAP searches for input validation vulnerabilities in PHP source code: cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, remote and local file inclusion, path traversal, OS command injection, and a few more. First, the tool has knowledge crafted manually about how to find these vulnerabilities. More specifically, it does taint analysis: it verifies if inputs can reach sensitive functions (sensitive sinks) without proper <b>sanitisation</b> or validation (taint analysis in Fig. 1). The lists of input entry points, sensitive sinks, and sanitisation/validation functions are produced by humans. Examples for XSS are in Table I Entry points Sensitive sinks <b>Sanitisation</b> functions $ GET echo htmlentities $ POST print htmlspecialchars $ COOKIE printf strip tags $ REQUEST die urlencod...|$|E
