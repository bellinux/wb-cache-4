[...] Ruth was so underwritten, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was able to bring to it was what made it special to me. [...] The looks, the affection, the pats on the head, the tone and inflection.

500|$|The March 30, 1974, concert {{featured}} an ethnically and age-diverse {{audience that}} included young hippies and old, wealthy attendees. According to Magnet magazine's Bryan Bierman, [...] "the hip, 'with it' kids [...] side-by-side with middle-aged tuxedoed couples, expecting to hear 'My Funny Valentine.'" [...] Although he lived only 15 minutes away, Davis {{arrived at the}} venue {{more than an hour}} late. When the band walked out onstage, he followed with his back turned to the audience, casually strolling onstage while the other musicians were setting up. Davis immediately began to play, and the band responded by playing a dense rhythm in unison. Saxophonist Dave Liebman, writing in the 1997 US reissue liner notes for Dark Magus, recalled the start of the show: [...] "It is his whim [...]. That's the thing!... Miles can do that and have three thousand musicians follow him. Right? <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> learned in that respect from Miles was to be able to watch him and be on his case".|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began in}} the summer of 1979 and {{continued}} periodically through November, with the production team shooting in several intervals for a few days each. A number of prominent gay activists, including Armistead Maupin, Cleve Jones and Sally Gearhart, assisted Crile and Diekhaus with the project, although Gearhart and fellow activist Del Martin began questioning their motives, coming to believe the network [...] "was out to do a hatchet job". Crile interviewed Gearhart for the piece but by the date of her interview she was so mistrustful of the producers that she took measures to try to prevent herself from being misrepresented. [...] "I would lift my voice at a certain point <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said could not be cut. He seemed to want me to vilify Diane (sic) Feinstein in some way and set her in opposition to the gay community....During one of the breaks I told him that I didn't feel good about it...I felt I had been twisted and manipulated." [...] Ultimately Gearhart's interview was cut entirely, for which she was [...] "ecstatic". When Crile began his interview with then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein by asking [...] "How {{does it feel to be}} the mayor of Sodom and Gomorrah?" [...] Feinstein threw him and his crew out of her office.|$|E
500|$|In the 1956 season, Feller started {{four games}} and {{appeared}} in 15 others, {{and finished with}} an 0–4 record and career-worst 4.97ERA. The Indians held [...] "Bob Feller Night" [...] on September 9, and he appeared in his last major league game on September 30. After the season, speculation mounted regarding whether Feller would retire as a player. In December 1956, Feller told The Plain Dealer: [...] "I will return to Cleveland later this week and plan to confer with Hank Greenberg before Christmas. I hope to reach a decision at that time." [...] Greenberg had also offered Feller his release or {{a job with the}} Indians in their front office. Greenberg said, [...] "We sincerely want Feller to remain with us. As far as I'm concerned, {{there will always be a}} job waiting for Bob in the Cleveland organization." [...] On December 28 Feller officially retired from the Indians as a player to continue his work selling insurance. Announcing his retirement, Feller said, [...] "I could have gone with a couple other ball clubs, but anything I might have done with them would have taken the edge off the success I have had with the Cleveland club the last 20 years." [...] He continued, [...] "What if I did pitch another year, <b>so</b> <b>what?</b> <b>I</b> would have to come to the decision I am making now, some time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sanders became {{interested}} in politics at an early age: [...] "A guy named Adolf Hitler won an election in 1932. He won an election, and 50 million people {{died as a result}} of that election in World War II, including 6 million Jews. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> learned as a little kid is that politics is, in fact, very important." [...] In the 1940s, many of Sanders' relatives in German-occupied Poland were killed in the Holocaust, including his father's half-brother, Bernie's uncle Abraham Schnützer, who was killed in 1942.|$|E

2500|$|The {{music of}} Ghetto Gothic is varied, {{incorporating}} elements of classical music, hip hop, reggae, and blues. Van Peebles stated of the album's musical experimentation, [...] "So many black artists are encouraged {{not to eat}} from the entire cornucopia of creative and technical options. I'm black; <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> do is black. Once you don't worry about that, you're free to manifest your artistry however you see it." [...] Van Peebles' lyrics range from lighter, humorous themes to more socially conscious material, such as [...] "Just Don't Make Sense", which focuses on the contradictions of the African American experience.|$|E
2500|$|... "In the end, what I {{realized}} is {{that throughout}} the course of creating this body of work, I learned a lot about myself. Though I didn't realize it at the time, all the directions I began exploring in the initial phases of recording were helping to pave a path for me of rediscovery. In the end I realized that I will always {{be a little bit of}} everything and I don't have to choose, I am sometimes extremely sensitive, sometimes upbeat, others dreamy and romantic, and even at times a little melodramatic. (Call it the Caribbean blood.) But always authentic and always sincere. Most importantly, I am enough., imperfections and all. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am offering you now is just that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1857 Goncharov went to Marienbad for medical treatment. There he wrote Oblomov, almost in its entirety. [...] "It might seem strange, even {{impossible}} that {{in the course of}} one month the whole of the novel might be written... But it'd been growing in me for several years, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had to do then was just sit and write everything down," [...] he later remembered. Goncharov's second novel Oblomov was published in 1859 in Otechestvennye Zapiski. It had evolved from the earlier [...] "Oblomov's Dream", which was later incorporated into the finished novel as Chapter 9. The novel caused much discussion in the Russian press, introduced another new term, oblomovshchina, to the literary lexicon and is regarded as a Russian classic.|$|E

2500|$|Perry {{stated that}} his foreign aid budget would start at $0 for all countries, {{including}} Israel. Bachmann and Santorum criticised him for suggesting that Pakistan should get no aid at all, with Santorum saying [...] "we can't be indecisive about whether Pakistan is our friend. They must be our friend, {{and we must}} engage them as friends". Bachmann drew raised eyebrows for her claim that China's economy was growing because of its lack of a social safety net, saying [...] "If you look at China, they don't have food stamps. They don't have the modern welfare state, and China's growing...

2500|$|Since the {{publication}} of his first book, My Story in 1975, he claimed that his wealth originated from being commissioned as a mineral-dowser and not from bending spoons and forks. In 2007, skeptics observed that Geller appeared to have dropped his claims that he does not perform magic tricks. Randi highlighted a quotation from the November 2007 issue of the magazine Magische Welt (Magic World) in which Geller said: [...] "I'll no longer say that I have supernatural powers. I am an entertainer. I want to do a good show. My entire character has changed." [...] In a later interview, Geller told Telepolis, [...] "I said to this German magazine, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did say, that I changed my character, {{to the best of my}} recollection, and I no longer say that I do supernatural things. It doesn't mean that I don't have powers. It means that I don't say 'it's supernatural', I say 'I'm a mystifier!' That's what I said. And the skeptics turned it around and said, 'Uri Geller said he's a magician!' I never said that." [...] In that interview, Geller further explained that when he is asked how he does his stunts, he tells children to [...] "Forget the paranormal. Forget spoon bending! Instead of that, focus on school! Become a positive thinker! Believe in yourself and create a target! Go to university! Never smoke! And never touch drugs! And think of success!" ...|$|E
