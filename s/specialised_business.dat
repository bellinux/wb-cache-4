5000|$|With an {{estimated}} 33 million people infected, the HIV and AIDS pandemic has severe humanitarian consequences {{as well as}} enormous effects on households, businesses and societies at large. HIV and AIDS is a workplace issue because it affects workers and their families, enterprises and communities which depend on them. For that reason, the workplace is one arena (out of many) to address the causes and implications of HIV and AIDS. The workplace has a vital {{role to play in}} the wider struggle to control the pandemic. Workplace programmes support prevention, expand access to care and ARV treatment, and promote non-discrimination. Globally, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has created Code of Practice on HIV/AIDS and the World of Work, a document that provides practical guidelines for HIV and Aids programmes at enterprise, community, and national levels.SWHAP is one of several initiatives that have been taken to address HIV and AIDS at the workplace level.

40|$|Part 2 : Full PapersInternational audienceThe {{competition}} {{inherent to}} globalisation has led enterprises {{to gather in}} nests of <b>specialised</b> <b>business</b> providers {{with the purpose of}} building better applications and provide more complete solutions. This, added to the improvements on the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), led to a paradigm shift from product-centrism to service-centrism and to the need to communicate and interoperate. Traditional segments like banking, insurance and aerospace subcontract a large number of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that are undergoing this change, and must ensure the criticality and accuracy of their business is not affected or impacted in any way. This paper proposes a methodology and a framework that provide critical businesses a control mechanism over the interoperability solutions in place on their subcontracted enterprises, imposing negotiations which formalise the solutions applied. It then focuses on its application on the business case of the Concurrent Design Facility of the European Space Agency (ESA-CDF) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{introductory}} overview highlighting {{some of the}} current knowledge as regards three critical questions related to the emerging knowledge economy: i) Why does human capital and talent tend to agglomerate in large urban regions?, ii) How does this agglomeration affect the location {{of different types of}} economic activities?, and iii) How does this agglomeration affect regional growth? There are different underlying agglomerative forces creating spatially concentrated increasing returns to scale. Also, cities become centres of various amenities due to general increases in real incomes offering people spare time activities. One major reason for the agglomeration of production in urban regions and metro¬politan areas today is the existence of various positive externalities, providing good settings for industries and firms with knowledge-intensive and knowledge-creation activities, <b>specialised</b> <b>business</b> service firms and headquarters of multinational firms. There are strong tentative empirical evidences that the agglomeration of human capital contributes to regional development and growth. However, there is uncertainty concerning the size of the human capital externalities.

30|$|Furthermore, {{our results}} {{have shown that}} women {{business}} owners {{were more likely to}} report an increase in enterprise profits when owners possessed skills that are relevant to their business operations. In other words, although microcredit access in our case does not seem to predict enterprise profitability, business owners who approached business ownership with sufficient stocks of business skills and experience seemed to experience increases in enterprise profits. Earlier research has also established that businesses operated by owners with business skills and experience are more likely to do better than owners without such skills and experience (Kuzilwa 2005). This implies that microfinance programmes could have a significant impact on economic empowerment and poverty alleviation among women borrowers if they target women business owners who possess some business skills that are requisite for the successful business creation and operation. Alternatively, microfinance programmes could introduce training modules in business skills to help their clientele create and operate profitable businesses. On the other hand, education level of the owner was not a significant predictor of enterprise profitability, possibly because the majority of the respondents (75 %) had attained only primary education level. This could mean that the education level of the business owner did not matter in determining profitability of their enterprises. This could also suggest that women business owners require more <b>specialised</b> <b>business</b> skills rather than just a formal education. Likewise, owners’ age did not seem to translate into increases in business profits.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – As a generalisation, the Sports {{industry}} is a multifaceted, complex and diverse industry, perhaps {{making it difficult to}} offer business support and advice. This paper aims to identify and analyse, through sport and recreation business owners (SMEs), their experience of business support and advice. The study can therefore be seen as contributing to related studies by Mole et al. (2008) and responding to Pawson and Tilley’s (1997) request for a more nuanced view of how public-support programmes work. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative, collective case study design is adopted. Three in–depth semi-structured interviews with Directors of Sport Businesses were undertaken to identify business support in the West Midlands Sports sector. Interviews focused on business development, the support and advice Directors received and the future direction of their business. Interviews were analysed using inductive and deductive content analysis (Côté et al., 1993). Findings – The findings from the case studies highlight a variety of general support and advice mechanisms, e. g. WBDA (Women’s Business Development Agency) with differences in regional provision evident. One strong emerging theme indicates that <b>specialised</b> <b>business</b> support occurs which appears critical but ad-hoc. Originality/value - This paper considers the specific business support needs in a largely unreported, yet growing sports sector (based upon a demand led inquiry) into existing providers and business recipients. These findings are pertinent for various organisations such as policy makers, small business support agencies, as well as sports businesses themselves; as they seek to both identify specific sector support needs and evaluate existing practice...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we draw on two studies that used face to face, {{qualitative}} interviews with technology-based small firms (TBSFs) and informal interviews with key informants. The interviews took place with two data sets of TBSFs, the first with 20 firms in 2011 {{and the second}} with 34 agri-business TBSFs in 2013. This allows some temporal comparisons of the funding environment for TBSFs in New Zealand, {{but this was not}} a longitudinal study as the two data sets were composed from the recruitment of different firms. However, all the TBSFs were located in New Zealand, a small open economy with a limited domestic market, a population of 4. 4 million, GDP per capita of US$ 32, 260 (2010) and arguably an immature and limited financial infrastructure. This environment is compounded for founding technology-based entrepreneurs, since to develop and stay in New Zealand means accepting being a long distance from major overseas markets, when in theory at least TBSFs have potential to be in global markets. Such TBSFs, therefore, face pressure to move overseas for markets and for finance and other resources; if successful they may make attractive takeover targets for overseas investors and MNCs. Despite these challenges, TBSFs have been promoted as key contributors to GDP and a way of closing New Zealand’s productivity gap (compared with Australia and other developed nations). Although we find evidence of the development of embryonic regional and <b>specialised</b> <b>business</b> angel networks (BANs) on the supply-side of finance, there is still a marked reluctance to undertake a search for external equity and evidence of discouraged borrowing and discouraged grant-based applications on the demand-side. New Zealand is sometimes described as “paradise ” due to its natural and outstanding beauty, but in our conclusions we suggest that the comparatively stable economic environment has not operated in favour of TBSFs...|$|E
