40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> length, fibre diameter, fibre type and fibre content {{on the degree}} of {{spalling}} of concrete in fire are investigated. Four types <b>of</b> <b>fibres,</b> namely, polypropylene, polyvinyl alcohol, cellulose and nylon with various lengths and diameters were studied. Fibre contents ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 15 % by volume of concrete. Fire tests were conducted according to the ISO 834 standard heating curve. Results showed that when comparing all the fibres under the same fibre content levels (% volume of concrete), the nylon fibre was the most effective in protecting concrete from spalling. Analysis revealed, regardless of the amount <b>of</b> <b>fibre,</b> the type <b>of</b> <b>fibre,</b> diameter <b>of</b> and length <b>of</b> <b>fibre,</b> there is a strong relationship between the total number <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> present per unit volume, length <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> and the degree of spalling observed. A critical minimum for total number <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> per unit volume for spalling protection in fire was established...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} various types <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> length, fibre diameter, fibre type and fibre content {{on the degree}} of spalling of concrete in fire. Four types <b>of</b> <b>fibres,</b> namely, polypropylene, polyvinyl alcohol, cellulose and nylon with various lengths and diameters were studied. Fibre contents ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 15 % by volume of concrete. Fire tests were conducted according to the ISO 834 standard heating curve. Results showed that when comparing all the fibres under the same fibre content levels (% volume of concrete), the nylon fibre was the most effective in protecting concrete from spalling. This is because the diameter <b>of</b> the nylon <b>fibres</b> were significantly less than the other fibres, hence there were significantly more number <b>of</b> nylon <b>fibres</b> present for the same fibre content (% volume) in concrete. Analysis revealed, regardless of the amount <b>of</b> <b>fibre,</b> the type <b>of</b> <b>fibre,</b> diameter <b>of</b> and length <b>of</b> <b>fibre,</b> there is a strong relationship between the total number <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> present per unit volume, length <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> and the degree of spalling observed.
