50|$|Glires (Latin glīrēs, dormice) is a clade (sometimes {{ranked as}} a grandorder) {{consisting}} of rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits, hares, and pikas).

40|$|The ethmoidal {{region of}} the skull houses {{one of the most}} {{important}} sense organs of mammals, the sense of smell. Investigation of the ontogeny and comparative anatomy of internal nasal structures of the macrosmatic order <b>Scandentia</b> is a significant contribution to the understanding of the morphotype of <b>Scandentia</b> with potential implications for our understanding of the primate nasal morphological pattern. For the first time perinatal and adult stages of Ptilocercus lowii and selected Tupaia species were investigated by serial histological sections and high-resolution computed tomography (μCT), respectively. <b>Scandentia</b> show a very common olfactory turbinal pattern of small mammals in having two frontoturbinals, three ethmoturbinals, and one interturbinal between the first and second ethmoturbinal. This indicates a moderately developed sense of smell (moderately macrosmatic). The observed septoturbinal is probably an apomorphic character of <b>Scandentia.</b> A general growth in length occurs during postnatal ontogeny; thus the adult ethmoidal region is proportionally longer compared to the rest of the skull. Throughout ontogeny Ptilocercus has a proportionally longer nasal cavity than Tupaia. Major differences exist between Ptilocercus and Tupaia in regard to the proportions of the nasal cavity which correlate with the position of the orbits. Compared to Tupaia, Ptilocercus shows more anteriorly oriented orbits and has a proportionally longer nasal capsule than Tupaia and based on anatomy probably a higher level of olfactory discrimination. Furthermore, Ptilocercus has a platybasic skull base that resembles a derived feature of Ptilocercidae. In contrast, Tupaia has a distinct septum interorbitale leading to a tropibasic skull, a pattern that is a plesiomorphic character of Tupaiidae and <b>Scandentia</b> in general. This finding helps us to understand the septum interorbitale pattern in Primates. Our results indicate that differences among the investigated <b>Scandentia</b> species are correlated with adaptations to foraging and behavioural biology...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Flying lemurs or Colugos (order Dermoptera) {{represent}} an ancient mammalian lineage that contains only two extant species. Although molecular evidence strongly supports that the orders Dermoptera, <b>Scandentia,</b> Lagomorpha, Rodentia and Primates form a superordinal clade called Supraprimates (or Euarchontoglires), the phylogenetic placement of Dermoptera within Supraprimates remains ambiguous. Results To search for cytogenetic signatures {{that could help}} to clarify the evolutionary affinities within this superordinal group, we have established a genome-wide comparative map between human and the Malayan flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus) by reciprocal chromosome painting using both human and G. variegatus chromosome-specific probes. The 22 human autosomal paints and the X chromosome paint defined 44 homologous segments in the G. variegatus genome. A putative inversion on GVA 11 was revealed by the hybridization patterns of human chromosome probes 16 and 19. Fifteen associations of human chromosome segments (HSA) were detected in the G. variegatus genome: HSA 1 / 3, 1 / 10, 2 / 21, 3 / 21, 4 / 8, 4 / 18, 7 / 15, 7 / 16, 7 / 19, 10 / 16, 12 / 22 (twice), 14 / 15, 16 / 19 (twice). Reverse painting of G. variegatus chromosome-specific paints onto human chromosomes confirmed the above results, and defined {{the origin of the}} homologous human chromosomal segments in these associations. In total, G. variegatus paints revealed 49 homologous chromosomal segments in the HSA genome. Conclusion Comparative analysis of our map with published maps from representative species of other placental orders, including <b>Scandentia,</b> Primates, Lagomorpha and Rodentia, suggests a signature rearrangement (HSA 2 q/ 21 association) that links <b>Scandentia</b> and Dermoptera to one sister clade. Our results thus provide new evidence for the hypothesis that <b>Scandentia</b> and Dermoptera have a closer phylogenetic relationship to each other than either of them has to Primates. </p...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{numerous}} large-scale phylogenomic studies, {{certain parts}} of the mammalian tree are extraordinarily difficult to resolve. We used the coding regions from 19 completely sequenced genomes to study the relationships within the super-clade Euarchontoglires (Primates, Rodentia, Lagomorpha, Dermoptera and <b>Scandentia)</b> because the placement of <b>Scandentia</b> within this clade is controversial. The difficulty in resolving this issue is due to the short time spans between the early divergences of Euarchontoglires, which may cause incongruent gene trees. The conflict in the data can be depicted by network analyses and the contentious relationships are best reconstructed by coalescent-based analyses. This method is expected to be superior to analyses of concatenated data in reconstructing a species tree from numerous gene trees. The total concatenated dataset used to study the relationships in this group comprises 5, 875 protein-coding genes (9, 799, 170 nucleotides) from all orders except Dermoptera (flying lemurs). Reconstruction of the species tree from 1, 006 gene trees using coalescent models placed <b>Scandentia</b> as sister group to the primates, which is in agreement with maximum likelihood analyses of concatenated nucleotide sequence data. Additionally, both analytical approaches favoured the Tarsier to be sister taxon to Anthropoidea, thus belonging to the Haplorrhine clade. When divergence times are short such as in radiations over periods of a few million years, even genome scale analyses struggle to resolve phylogenetic relationships. On these short branches processes such as incomplete lineage sorting and possibly hybridization occur and make i...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —Two {{conflicting}} hypotheses {{concern the}} origin of flying mammals. The traditional hypothesis states that the two major groups of bats, the microchiropterans and the megachirop-terans, are sister groups that constitute the taxon Chiroptera. In contrast, the diphyly hypothesis suggests that megachiropterans are {{more closely related to}} primates than to microchiropterans. Different suites of morphological characters provide support for each of these hypotheses, and previous molecular studies have not provided a clear resolution of the problem. We analyzed a region of the mitochondrial 12 S ribosomal RNA gene from 11 species of mammals, including 2 species of megachiropterans, 2 species of microchiropterans, a primate, a colugo (Dermoptera), a tree shrew (<b>Scandentia),</b> and 4 outgroups, to test the diphyly hypothesis. A phylogenetic analysis of 257 base pairs resulted in two shortest unrooted trees that significantly support the monophyly of the bats and also suggest that the colugo is more closely related to primates than to the bats: (((Primates, Dermoptera) <b>Scandentia)</b> (Microchiroptera, Megachiroptera)). The topology sup-porting the diphyly hypothesis is 10 steps longer than the most-parsimonious unrooted tree. Although the traditional hypothesis is supported with respect to bat monophyly, the rDNA data support the nontraditional grouping of colugo and primates (a hypothesis also supported b...|$|E

40|$|Introns are {{generally}} believed to evolve too rapidly and too erratically {{to be of}} much use in phylogenetic reconstructions. Few phylogenetically informative intron sequences are available, however, to ascertain the validity of this supposition. In the present study the supposition was tested on {{the example of the}} mammalian class II major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) genes of the DRB family. Since the Mhc genes evolve under balancing selection and are believed to recombine or rearrange frequently, the evolution of their introns could be expected to be particularly rapid and subject to scrambling. Sequences of intron 4 and 5 DRB genes were obtained from polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments of genomic DNA from representatives of six eutherian orders—Primates, <b>Scandentia,</b> Chiroptera, Dermoptera, Lagomorpha, and Insectivora. Although short stretches of the introns have indeed proved to be unalignable, the bulk of the intron sequences from all six orders, spanning > 85 million years (my) of evolution, could be aligned and used in a study of the tempo and mode of intron evolution. The analysis has revealed the Mhc introns to evolve at a rate similar to that of other genes and of synonymous sites of non-Mhc genes. No evidence of homogenization or large-scale scrambling of the intron sequences could be found. The Mhc introns apparently evolve largely by point mutations and insertions/deletions. The phylogenetic signals contained in the intron sequences could be used to identify <b>Scandentia</b> as the sister group of Primates, to support the existence of the Archonta superorder, and to confirm the monophyly of the Chiroptera...|$|E
