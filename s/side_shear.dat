The diameter of these drilled shafts ranges from 1. 0 m to 1. 8 m and from 28 m to 60 m in depth. They typically penetrate through and found in weathered rocks and soils. Generally, the design for <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> of large diameter drilled shafts in weathered rocks and soils involve considerable uncertainty and design parameters must usually be verified by field tests. In this paper, 27 full-scale load tests on large diameter drilled shaft including 14 drilled shafts founded in soils and 13 drilled shafts socketed in weathered rocks are reviewed and studied in detail.

40|$|In Hong Kong large {{diameter}} long {{bored piles}} and barrettes {{are often used}} to support tall buildings to resist both vertical and horizontal loads. These piles penetrate through and may be founded in saprolitic soils or rocks. Generally, the design for <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> resistance (often called skin friction) of large diameter bored piles (drilled caissons or shafts) in saprolites involves considerable uncertainty and design parameters must usually be verified by field tests. In this paper, 28 full-scale load tests on large diameter machine bored piles constructed in various saprolitic soils were reviewed in detail, in particular the degree of mobilization of <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> resistance using a mobilization rating factor. The diameter of these floating piles ranges from 1. 0 m to 1. 5 m and the depth from 22 m to 75 m. The authors were heavily involved in the recent construction and testing of 12 of these piles. For bored piles constructed under water, 90 % ultimate <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> resistance was mobilized at an average local pile displacement of 1. 9 % of the pile diameter with a 95 % confidence range of 0. 9 % to 3. 0 %. For piles constructed under bentonite, ultimate <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> resistance was achieved at a local pile displacement of 1 % of the pile diameter. For non-grouted bored piles constructed under water, the mobilized <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> resistance lies between 0. 5 (N) over bar and 2. 0 (N) over bar (kPa) and (Î²) over bar values fall within 0. 1 and 0. 5, with average values of 1. 2 (N) over bar (kPa) and 0. 3 respectively. Post-grouting improves the capacity of <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> resistance {{by a factor of}} about 2 as compared with the non-grouted piles constructed under water.

Results from the laboratory testing program suggest that HPX-piles have approximately 10 percent greater <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> capacity than conventional HP-piles, on average. Unit <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> and the <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> parameter [beta] for both smooth and textured piles generally increased with increasing effective stress and increasing over consolidation ratio. HPX-piles were found to exhibit slightly greater settlement at failure than HP-piles, although scatter in the settlement data was significant [...] Steel H-piles are small displacement deep foundation elements. Typically, H-piles are driven to/into a hard stratum and the axial capacity of the pile is derived from the end bearing of the pile tip on the hard stratum. However, H-piles can be and are used as friction piles. Presumably, if the <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of a given H-pile can be increased, the use and applicability of H-piles will also increase. Conventional H-piles have smooth flanges.

40|$|Drilled shafts are {{cylindrical}} deep foundations {{constructed by}} casting fluid concrete into an excavated hole. These elements rely largely on <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> resistance generated by their substantial diameters and lengths to effectively transfer loads. Therefore, an exceptional concrete to soil interface {{is essential for}} proper performance of these structures. The FDOT preferred stabilization fluid, bentonite slurry, has been proven to degrade this interface with increased exposure time due to filter cake formation. For this reason, slurry exposure time has been limited to 36 hours by FDOT. Alternately, polymer slurries do not form a filter cake but rather stabilize excavations through continuous soil infiltration and the associated cohesion that accompanies the slurry presence. As polymer slurry use is relatively new {{to the state of}} Florida, FDOT does not presently have clear specifications regarding polymer exposure time limits. Hence, this thesis presents the results of pullout tests performed on 1 / 10 th scale drilled shafts constructed with both polymer and bentonite slurries and with varying exposure times. To explore the effect of exposure time on <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> resistance, 24 - 4 in diameter 8 ft long shafts were constructed: 6 with bentonite and 18 with three different polymer products (6 each). After being exposed to the respective slurry for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 or 24 hours, each excavated hole was concreted and tested after 7 days of curing. Pullout tests served as a direct measure of <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> resistance due to the absence of base resistance associated with compression testing. After testing, shafts were exhumed and sectioned for filter cake measurement. As expected, shafts constructed using bentonite slurries immediately exhibited a decrease in capacity with increased exposure time. Between 0 and 24 hours a 34 % reduction in capacity was witnessed. These reductions were attributed to filter cake thickness which increased with exposure time along with the reduction in effective shaft. After 4 hours of exposure, <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> resistance for the bentonite shafts approached an asymptote, likely defined by the strength of the filter cake formed. The <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> resistance of all polymer shafts exceeded that of the 24 hr bentonite control shaft by 20 - 50 percent depending on the polymer product used. For a given polymer product no capacity reduction was noted with respect to time. Inspection of exhumed shafts revealed the formation of a soil cake (region of stabilized soil stuck to the shaft) {{around the perimeter of the}} polymer shafts. Therefore, the <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> resistance of the polymer shafts was defined by the soil-to-soil interface surrounding the shaft and not by an intermediate filter cake. The study resulted in the following findings: (1) open excavations using polymer slurry stabilization are not adversely affected by extended exposure time, (2) the effect of filter cake formation in bentonite supported excavations slows with time whereby no significant degradation in capacity was noted after 8 hours, (3) shafts constructed with polymer slurry performed better than those constructed with bentonite, and (4) as polymer slurry flow into the surrounding soil does not slow with time, more slurry volume is required (compared with bentonite) and slurry level must be continuously maintained...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{developing}} an improved thermo-mechanical soil-structure interaction (i. e., load transfer) analysis {{to assess the}} axial strains, stresses, and displacements during thermo-mechanical loading of energy piles in different soils having different end restraint boundary conditions. This study builds on established analyses by (i) incorporating an algorithm to identify {{the location of the}} point of zero displacement (i. e., the null point) during changes in temperature, (ii) adding models for the ultimate <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> resistance representative of drained and undrained soils, and (iii) incorporating an unloading path for the <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> resistance curve. A parametric evaluation was performed to understand the roles of the soil shear strength parameters, toe stiffness, head stiffness, <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> stress-displacement curve, and radial expansion, as well as the foundation type, mechanical load magnitude, and temperature change magnitude. This investigation showed that the end restraint boundary conditions played the most important role in controlling the magnitude and location of the maximum thermal axial stress. The soil type also caused changes in the nonlinearity of the axial stress distribution throughout the energy pile. The radial expansion did not affect the thermo-mechanical soil-structure interaction for the conditions investigated in this study. The thermo-mechanical load-transfer analysis was then calibrated to identify the parameters that match the observed soil-structure interaction responses from four case studies involving non plastic soils, including one field study and three centrifuge studies. The ranges of calibrated parameters provides insight into the behavior of energy piles in non plastic soils, and can be used for preliminary design guidance...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect on <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> resistance in limestone when temporary casing is used. Due to testing in actual limestone being an unrealistic goal, simulated limestone mixes were prepared and cast into 6 â 42 in. diameter beds. Limestone throughout Florida can be quite varied (e. g. 50 - 5000 psi) but where stronger limestone is not likely to be penetrated by casing installation. Therefore, target unconfined compressive strengths of the study specimens ranged between 60 psi to 850 psi. A simulated limestone material was developed based on over 200 cylinders cast for unconfined compression testing where the binder (cement or lime), water to binder ratio, aggregate types (sand, coquina, and oyster shells), and binder content were all varied. Results of the laboratory tests were used to establish simulated limestone mixes for 42 in. diameter specimen beds in which 1 / 10 th scale drilled shaft rock sockets were cast. Drilled shaft casing installation techniques were adapted to 1 / 10 th scale where driven casing and oscillated/rotated casing methods were simulated. Within each of the simulated limestone test beds, 5 shaft specimens were cast with and without temporary casing where at least one of the specimens was cast without temporary casing (control specimen). Pullout tests of each specimen revealed that the presence of temporary casing reduced the <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> by 25 to 28 percent depending on the casing installation/extraction method.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cemented {{calcareous}} formations, typically {{referred to}} as chalk or marl, are widespread in the southeastern U.

40|$|In {{the state}} of Florida {{one of the primary}} factors which {{influences}} design of structures is the effect of hurricane force winds on structures. These forces can be greater than any other force encountered throughout the lifetime of said structure. For this reason, designing a structure to resist such forces can greatly increase the cost and time required for completing construction projects. Traditionally, large concrete footings have been utilized to resist wind-induced uplift forces. These footings do little more than act as large reaction masses to weigh down the building. An alternative and little-used method for resisting these large uplift forces is the use of mini-pile anchors. Mini-pile anchors generate <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> at the interface between the pile and the soil which resists the uplift forces.

The cost efficiency of each method is evaluated which provides a guideline for where and when a given foundation option is appropriate.

40|$|Two main seismic {{features}} {{characterize the}} Earthâs inner core: a North-South polar anisotropy and an East-West asymmetry of P-wave velocity and attenuation. Anisotropy is expected if shear deformation is induced by convective motions. Translation {{has recently been}} put forward as an important mode of convection of the inner core. Combined with a simple diffusive grain growth model, this mechanism is able to explain the observed seismic asymmetry, but not the bulk anisotropy. The source of anisotropy has therefore to be sought in the shear motions caused by higher modes of convection. Using a hybrid finite-difference spherical harmonics Navier-Stokes solver, we investigate the interplay between translation and convection in a 3 D spherical model with permeable boundary conditions at the inner core boundary. Three parameters act independently: viscosity, internal heating and convection velocity in the outer core. Our numerical simulations show the dominance of pure translation for viscosities of the inner core higher than 1020 Pas. Translation is almost completely hampered by convective motions for viscosities lower than 1018 Pas. Between these values, translation and convection develop, but convective downwellings are restricted to the coldest hemisphere where crystallization occurs. On the opposite <b>side,</b> <b>shear</b> is almost absent, thereby allowing grain growth.

The work includes the testing of full scale piles in a chamber of sand. The chamber allows for different piles to be tested. The test plan is as follows: A large chamber with a hole in the bottom will have a pile placed in it and then be filled with sand. The hole {{in the bottom of the}} chamber will not allow the pile to absorb any load from end bearing. The density of the sand placed around the pile can be correlated to the height from which it is dropped into the chamber. A bladder is then placed on top on the sand, followed by the lid to the chamber and the loading frame. The bladder is filled with a certain air pressure that will increase the stresses of the sand, which simulates deeper soils. Loads will then be applied by a hydraulic cylinder and the deflections measured until the pile fails. The amount of load applied to the cylinder will be measured by two methods, using a load cell and by multiplying the pressure applied to the cylinder by its area. Then, by knowing the area of the pile in contact with the soil and the load, the friction resistance of the piles can be calculated. So far, only preliminary test has been conducted.

40|$|Thermal {{convection}} in the Antarctic Ice Sheet {{was proposed}} in 1970. Demonstrating its existence {{proved to be}} elusive. In 2009, tributaries to ice streams were postulated as the surface expression of underlying thermal convection rolls aligned in directions of advective ice flow. Two definitive tests of this hypothesis are now possible, using highly accurate ice elevations and velocities provided by the European, Japanese, and Canadian Space Agencies that allow icestream tributaries and their velocities to be mapped. These tests are 1) measuring lowering of tributary surfaces to see if lowering is due only to advective ice thinning, or also requires lowering en masse in the broad descending part of convective flow, and 2) measuring transverse surface ice velocities to see if ice entering tributaries from the sides increases while crossing lateral shear zones, as would be required if this flow is augmented by convective flow ascending in the narrow <b>side</b> <b>shear</b> zones and diverted into tributaries by advective ice flow. If (1) and (2) are applied to tributaries converging on Byrd Glacier, the same measurements can be conducted when tributaries pack together to become âflow stripesâ down Byrd Glacier and onto the Ross Ice Shelf to see if (2) is reduced when lateral advection stops. This could determine if thermal convection remains active or shuts down as ice thins. Thermal convection in the Antarctic Ice Sheet would raise three questions. Can it cause the ice sheet to self-destruct as convective flow turns on and off? Does it render invalid climate records extracted at depth from ice cores? Can the ice sheet be studied as a miniature mantle analogous in some respects to Earthâs mantle...|$|E
5000|$|The Cessna {{had been}} cleared by ground control to back-taxi on runway 31 to the end and wait for takeoff clearance. For reasons unknown it {{continued}} beyond this point on taxiway R to runway 30R and held in position there. TWA 427 was cleared by ground control to taxi to runway 30R by crossing runway 30L then down taxiway P to the end. After receiving permission to take off, the copilot initiated the takeoff roll. When the captain called 80 knots an off-duty crewmember in the jumpseat yelled, [...] "There's an airplane!" [...] Braking was immediately initiated and the captain attempted to use the rudder {{to go around the}} Cessna to the left. The jet struck the Cessna on the right <b>side,</b> <b>shearing</b> {{off the top of the}} small plane. The pilot and passenger on the small plane were instantly killed. The captain immediately asked for safety equipment, and passenger evacuation was initiated, resulting in eight minor injuries. Aircraft continued to land on runway 30L and taxi nearby during passenger evacuation. The captain of TWA 427 was Rick Carr, the first officer was Randy Speed, and the ACM was Randy Richardson.|$|R

The outstation has a 16-stand shearing shed, an overseer's house, shearers' and station hands' accommodation, mess and kitchen facilities.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} test the {{performance}} of a cannonball, various types of media are used in a test site. The best media should have good stability, effectiveness, economic feasibility, etc. Among them, sand is most widely used. Sand, which consists of many small grains, can be used effectively in a site. In this study, the penetration depth of a cannonball is analyzed for shear modulus using FEM. It is found that the penetration depth decreases with the shear modulus of sand. For management of a test <b>side,</b> the <b>shear</b> modulus of sand is an important factor...|$|R
