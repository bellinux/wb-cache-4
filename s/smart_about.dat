Lobb explained that [...] "things {{are large and}} blocky because that's what [...] looks like", meaning that the sharper textures and higher resolution simply make the game look clearer. He also observed that, as character and weapon models were remodeled from their original low hundreds polygon count to polygons in the thousands, {{he was worried about}} them looking awkward in the low-poly geometry level design. According to him, [...] "it's one of the areas that I give a lot of credit to the developer on. It just looks right. They were <b>smart</b> <b>about</b> the way they up-resed the models so they still feel like they're kind of retro, but they're clean." ...|$|E

Marqusee describes the song as one of [...] "the purest songs of protest ever sung", as it looks at the media and its inability to understand both the singer and his work. He writes that the song became the anthem of an in-group, [...] "disgusted by the old, excited by the new... elated by their discovery of others who shared their feelings", with its refrain [...] "Something is happening here/ But you don't know what it is/ Do you, Mr Jones?" [...] epitomizing the [...] "hip exclusivity" [...] of the burgeoning counterculture. Robert Shelton describes the song's central character, Mr Jones, as [...] "one of Dylan's greatest archetypes", characterizing him as [...] "a Philistine... superficially educated and well bred but not very <b>smart</b> <b>about</b> the things that count".|$|E

2500|$|To be honest, I wasn't very <b>smart</b> <b>about</b> things. At {{that stage}} I was still {{averaging}} 40 after nine Tests {{or so and}} with the Packer players away, {{most of the other}} guys in the Aussie Test team were very new to the team.

I probably played more aggressively than I should have. My feeling was I wanted to give the crowd something to look at when they came in the gates. I should have been more circumspect.

Yates spoke {{of the decision to}} appoint him {{as the director of the}} final films, remarking that [...] "they wanted to do a Harry Potter that felt ... more grown up. What's <b>smart</b> <b>about</b> the studio and the producers is they have always wanted to push it a bit. Chris Columbus did a wonderful job of casting and making this world incredibly popular. But rather than do more of the same, they said, 'Let's bring in Alfonso Cuarón and let him run with it. Then later, let's bring in David Yates, who's done all this hard-hitting stuff on TV.' It's a testament to their ambition to try to keep the franchise fresh. The bizarre thing is, I did one [...] and they asked me to stay for three more, so obviously they liked something." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{response}} of major American film reviewers was widely favorable. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{described it as}} [...] "so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way {{that you want to}} rub noses in it— the noses of those zombie writers who take 'screenwriting' classes that teach them the formulas for 'hit films.'" [...] Richard Corliss of TIME wrote, [...] "It towers over the year's other movies as majestically and menacingly as a gang lord at a preschool. It dares Hollywood films to be this <b>smart</b> <b>about</b> going this far. If good directors accept Tarantino's implicit challenge, the movie theater could again be a great place to live in." [...] In Newsweek, David Ansen wrote, [...] "The miracle of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is how, being composed of secondhand, debased parts, it succeeds in gleaming like something new." [...] "You get intoxicated by it," [...] wrote Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman, [...] "high on the rediscovery of how pleasurable a movie can be. I'm not sure I've ever encountered a filmmaker who combined discipline and control with sheer wild-ass joy the way that Tarantino does." [...] "There's a special kick that comes from watching something this thrillingly alive", wrote Peter Travers of Rolling Stone. [...] "Pulp Fiction is indisputably great." [...] Overall, the film attained exceptionally high ratings among U.S. reviewers: a 94% score based on 78 reviews at Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 9.1/10, the site's consensus reading, [...] "One of the most influential films of the 1990s, Pulp Fiction is a delirious post-modern mix of neo-noir thrills, pitch-black humor, and pop-culture touchstones". It has an average score of 94/100 based on 24 reviews on Metacritic.|$|E

6000|$|The sprays {{swept over}} {{whistling}} and pattering. Men disturbed in their peaceful torpor by {{the pain of}} quarrelsome shouts, moaned, muttering curses. Mr. Baker crawled off a little way to leeward where a water-cask loomed up big, with something white against it. [...] "Is it you, Podmore?" [...] asked Mr. Baker, He had to repeat the question twice before the cook turned, coughing feebly.--"Yes, sir. I've been praying in my mind for a quick deliverance; for I am prepared for any call.... I------"--"Look here, cook," [...] interrupted Mr. Baker, [...] "the men are perishing with cold."--"Cold!" [...] said the cook, mournfully; [...] "they will be warm enough before long."--"What?" [...] asked Mr. Baker, looking along the deck into the faint sheen of frothing water.--"They are a wicked lot," [...] continued the cook solemnly, but in an unsteady voice, [...] "about as wicked as any ship's company in this sinful world! Now, I"--he trembled {{so that he could}} hardly speak; his was an exposed place, and in a cotton shirt, a thin pair of trousers, and with his knees under his nose, he received, quaking, the flicks of stinging, salt drops; his voice sounded exhausted--"now. I--any time ... My eldest youngster, Mr. Baker.. a clever boy... last Sunday on shore before this voyage he wouldn't go to church, sir. Says I, 'You go and clean yourself, or I'll know the reason why!' What does he do?... Pond, Mr. Baker--fell into the pond in his best rig, sir!... Accident?... 'Nothing will save you, fine scholar though you are!' says I.... Accident!... I whopped him, sir, till I couldn't lift my arm...." [...] His voice faltered. [...] "I whopped 'im!" [...] he repeated, rattling his teeth; then, after a while, let out a mournful sound that was half a groan, half a snore. Mr. Baker shook him by the shoulders. [...] "Hey! Cook! Hold up, Podmore! Tell me--is there any fresh water in the galley tank? The ship is lying along less, I think; I would try to get forward. A little water would do them good. Hallo! Look out! Look out!" [...] The cook struggled.--"Not you, sir--not you!" [...] He began to scramble to windward. [...] "Galley!... my business!" [...] he shouted.--"Cook's going crazy now," [...] said several voices. He yelled:--"Crazy, am I? I am more ready to die than any of you, officers incloosive--there! As long as she swims I will cook! I will get you coffee."--"Cook, ye are a gentleman!" [...] cried Belfast. But the cook was already going over the weather-ladder. He stopped for a moment to shout back on the poop:--"As long as she swims I will cook!" [...] and disappeared as though he had gone overboard. The men who had heard sent after him a cheer that sounded like a wail of sick children. An hour or more afterwards some one said distinctly: [...] "He's gone for good."--"Very likely," [...] assented the boatswain; [...] "even in fine weather he was as <b>smart</b> <b>about</b> the deck as a milch-cow on her first voyage. We ought to go and see." [...] Nobody moved. As the hours dragged slowly through the darkness Mr. Baker crawled back and forth along the poop several times. Some men fancied they had heard him exchange murmurs with the master, but at that time the memories were incomparably more vivid than anything actual, and they were not certain whether the murmurs were heard now or many years ago. They did not try to find out. A mutter more or less did not matter. It was too cold for curiosity, and almost for hope. They could not spare a moment or a thought from the great mental occupation of wishing to live. And the desire of life kept them alive, apathetic and enduring, under the cruel persistence of wind and cold; while the bestarred black dome of the sky revolved slowly above the ship, that drifted, bearing their patience and their suffering, through the stormy solitude of the sea.|$|E
