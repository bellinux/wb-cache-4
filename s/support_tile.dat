50|$|Except for the beginning, at {{no point}} can two players have the same Daimyo or Samurai honor. If one player moves onto another players honor amount, the moving player {{progresses}} one additional square. Daimyo honor is gained in three ways: Selling Katanas, acquiring territory, and converting Samurai honor. At {{the beginning of the}} Daimyos turn they may place three yellow triple katana tokens back in the <b>support</b> <b>tile</b> bag in order to progress up one Daimyo honor. the Daimyo may do this as many times as they wish, although it must only be done {{at the beginning of their}} turn. When the Daimyo gains territory they also gain the honor that territory provides, while if they lose a territory they lose any honor it provides.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{evaluated}} the structural behavior of porticos made from eucalyptus glued boards, using wood of Eucalyptus sp and resorcinol formaldehyde adhesive. Three units, in real scale, of tri-articulated straight porticos, with a 5 meter porthole and a 26 º inclination, capable to <b>support</b> <b>tiles</b> covering placement were designed, constructed {{and subjected to}} load testing, until rupture. The amount of adhesive used {{in the construction of}} the porticos was 250 g/m 2 and the bonding pressure of 1. 3 MPa. The Hankinson model was employed as an estimator of the glued joints strength, under different angles between the fibers. The average value for the last resistance of the structures was 4. 63 times the design load, according to the criteria established by the ABNT, 1997. The structures showed satisfactory mechanical performance and deformations lower than the ones allowed by the standard. It was concluded there is technical feasibility to manufacture porticos fully bonded with small thickness veneers...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a framework}} for integrated Augmented Reality (AR) architecture for indoor thermal performance data visualization that utilizes a mobile robot to generate environment maps. It consists of three modules: robot mapping, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation, and AR visualization. The robot mapping module enables the modelling of spatial geometry using a mobile robot. In order to generate steady approximations to scanned 3 D datasets, the paper presents a novel “Split and Merge Expectation-Maximization Patch Fitting ” (SMEMPF) planar approximation method. The developed SMEMPF method extends the classical Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. It allows for precise adjustment of patches independent from the initial model. The final result {{is a set of}} patches identifying planar macro structures that consist of a collection of <b>supported</b> <b>tiles.</b> These patches are utilized to model the spatial geometry under investigation. The CFD simulation module facilitates the prediction of building performance data based on the spatial data generated using the SMEMPF method. The AR visualization module assists in interactive, immersive visualization of CFD simulation results. Such an integrated AR architecture will facilitate rapid multi-room mobile AR visualizations...|$|R
5000|$|Bushido {{is played}} on a Hex map made up of several {{different}} tiles. These tiles are shuffled and arranged face down so that the game has a different board each time. Players then take turns picking a base (which they leave face down), and then flipping tiles they want until all players control 6 tiles. Play begins with the oldest player, going clockwise. To offset the benefit of going first, while the first person draws 10 <b>support</b> <b>tiles,</b> the second person draws 11, the third twelve, and so on. All player count up their Daimyo honor on the board (the green symbol), and then add up their rice and swords. Players then place a number of troops on the board equivalent to their rice total. All this information is recorded on a small board provided with the game. Players then draw 4 tactics tokens each, and place their samurai honor at 10. Players must always have 4 tactics tokens, and if they lose one they must immediately draw back to 4. Play then begins ...|$|R
