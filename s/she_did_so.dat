5|$|In late 1998, when long-time Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York {{announced}} his retirement, Rangel {{was one of}} the first to advocate that First Lady Hillary Clinton move to New York and run for the seat. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> <b>so,</b> successfully.|$|E

5|$|After {{several months}} of conditioning, training, {{revamping}} routines and showing readiness at summer training camp, Liukin petitioned for a spot at the Visa National Championships. In order for the petition to be granted, she had to show readiness by scoring at least a 14.0 on one apparatus at a qualifying event (the U.S. Secret Classic) on May 26. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> <b>so,</b> scoring a 14.9 on balance beam.|$|E

5|$|Cagney's {{frequent}} co-star, Pat O'Brien, {{appeared with}} him on the British chat show Parkinson in the early 1980s and they both made a surprise appearance at the Queen Mother's command birthday performance at the London Palladium in 1980. His appearance on stage prompted the Queen Mother to rise to her feet, the only time <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> during the whole show, and she later broke protocol to go backstage to speak with Cagney directly.|$|E
5|$|Howe and Queen Charlotte led {{the fleet}} by example, sailing {{directly}} at the French flagship Montagne. Passing between Montagne and the next in line Vengeur du Peuple, Queen Charlotte raked both and hauled up close to Montagne {{to engage in a}} close-range artillery battle. As <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>so,</b> Queen Charlotte also became briefly entangled with Jacobin, and exchanged fire with her too, causing serious damage to both French ships.|$|E
5|$|Both Lowell and Sexton {{encouraged}} Plath {{to write}} from her experience and <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>so.</b> She openly discussed her depression with Lowell and her suicide attempts with Sexton, who {{led her to}} write from a more female perspective. Plath began to conceive {{of herself as a}} more serious, focused poet and short-story writer. At this time Plath and Hughes first met the poet W. S. Merwin, who admired their work and was to remain a lifelong friend. Plath resumed psychoanalytic treatment in December, working with Ruth Beuscher.|$|E

5|$|During the duel between Vengeur and Brunswick, the {{undamaged}} HMS Ramillies {{had approached}} and put {{herself in a}} favourable position to rake Vengeur, and was waiting for Brunswick to separate to open fire. When <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>so,</b> Ramillies fired two broadsides, leaving Vengeur with only her foremast standing, which fell half an hour later. Ramillies sustained some damage herself. Soon afterwards, seawater inundated the powder room of Vengeur, denying her all means of defence, and 250 of her crew were out of action. The Trente-et-un Mai closed in around 3:30, attempting to provide assistance, but the proximity of several British sails endangered her so that she eventually sailed away.|$|E
5|$|Haislett was {{the first}} American woman to defeat a swimmer from East Germany in the 100-meter {{freestyle}} since the 1972 Summer Olympics; <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> at the 1990 Goodwill Games in Seattle, Washington. At the 1991 World Aquatics Championships in Perth, Western Australia, Haislett won the 100-meter freestyle, and swam the anchor legs for the winning U.S. teams in the 4×100-meter freestyle and the 4×100-meter medley relays, ending the East German women's eighteen years of overwhelming dominance in the 100-meter freestyle at the world championships. Haislett also endured the emotional agony of disqualifying her team on an early exchange in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay – a relay race that the American women won in the water.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Hershey won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Special for {{her role}} as Candy Morrison in A Killing in a Small Town, which was based on Candy Montgomery's {{acquittal}} for the death of Betty Gore. Montgomery had killed Gore on Friday, June 13, 1980, in Gore's Wylie, Texas, home, by hitting her 41 times with an ax. The jury determined that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> in self-defense. In preparation for the part, Hershey had a phone conversation with Montgomery. Many of the names of the real-life principals in the case were changed for the movie. The film's alternative title was Evidence of Love, the name of a 1984 book about the case.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately for Captain Segond, when dawn broke on 18 October, HMS Anson was {{revealed}} {{only a short}} distance off, limping southwards after the damage its rigging and masts had suffered before the battle on 12 October. Although his ship was almost unmanageable, Captain Durham {{was not prepared to}} lose a second opportunity to engage, and slowly brought his vessel to bear on Loire, which was unable to escape. Accompanying Anson was Kangaroo, recovered from the damage of 16 October and ready for further action. At 10:30, Anson and Loire began firing on one another, neither able to effectively manoeuvre and both relying on firepower to overwhelm their opponent. Kangaroo closed on the unprotected stern of Loire, firing as <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> and repeatedly raking the immobile French ship. By 12:00 Loire had lost her mainmast and was leaking badly, forcing Segond to surrender. His ship was towed to port as the sixth prize of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Henry Peake (1821–1886) was occupying Westholme by 1885. Peake was a {{solicitor}} {{who served}} as clerk to the county magistrates, and was {{a partner in the}} local law firm Peake, Snow and Peake, along with his son Henry Arthur Peake. The partnership had connections with Kirk and Parry, and Peake married Eliza, a daughter of Charles Kirk the elder. After his death, Peake's sons, George Herbert and Henry Arthur, successively occupied the house in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During the First World War, Henry Arthur and his wife, Alice Ann, lost three of their sons in battle. In 1923, Henry Arthur died while staying at Hastings. He and his wife were planning to sell Westholme and move to Guildford before his death; <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> and died there in 1933. The businessman and Liberal politician Samuel Pattinson (1870–1942) lived at the house from at least 1924. His wife, Betsy Sharpley Pattinson, also died in 1942 and their trustees auctioned off the furniture at Westholme two years later.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the court}} was {{convinced}} of her guilt, her refusal to admit guilt made her position worse on {{the eyes of the}} court. One suggestion was, that at the place of execution, she would be given a last chance to confess her sin; if <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>so,</b> she would be decapitated before she was burned.|$|E
