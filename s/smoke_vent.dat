40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} developed to investigate {{the effect of a}} sprinkler spray on adjacent horizontal <b>smoke</b> <b>venting</b> and in particular the water droplet drag component. The pressure difference across a roof vent and the volumetric flow of <b>smoke</b> <b>vented</b> are determined by considering the interaction between the drag force of the sprinkler spray and the buoyancy of the smoke layer in the spray region. <b>Smoke</b> <b>venting</b> may become progressively more inefficient as the sprinkler operating pressure increases due to the cooling and drag effect of the sprinkler spray. Full scale experiments were carried out to validate the model. Results show that the {{mathematical model}} can predict the observed trend of a decrease in vented volumetric flow with an increase in sprinkler operating pressure, which eventually leads to ineffective <b>smoke</b> <b>venting.</b> Experiments with different <b>smoke</b> <b>venting</b> areas show that vent area has little influence on smoke flow once sprinkler pressure causes a loss in smoke flow efficiency or vent function.

40|$|A set {{of burning}} {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the influence of <b>smoke</b> <b>vent</b> height and exhausting velocity on mechanical smoke exhausting efficiency. Results {{have shown that the}} smoke exhausting process becomes more efficient due to the increased <b>smoke</b> <b>vent</b> height and the decreased exhausting velocity, which eliminate the plug-holing issue with fewer disturbances on the smoke layer interface. For each certain exhausting velocity, there is a critical value of distance between the vent and the bottom of the smoke layer. When the distance is less than the critical value, the smoke exhausting is inefficient, and the efficiency decreases sharply as the distance decreases. Contrarily, when the distance is greater than the critical value, a good efficiency can be acquired and the exhausted smoke increased relatively slowly as the distance increases. A critical Froude number, proposed by Hinkley to predict the onset of plug-holing effect in gravity venting systems, was validated in the experiments. However, the experimental results indicate that in the tests without the plug-holing, the fresh air entrained due to smoke exhausting is up to 48 % of the mechanical exhausting rate...|$|E
40|$|Discharge rate of a {{horizontal}} adjacent <b>smoke</b> <b>vent</b> under sprinkler spray is experimentally investigated. Temperature of smoke layer and velocity of smoke venting were measured, under different sprinkler operating pressures and smoke venting areas. CO concentration at the <b>smoke</b> <b>vent</b> center and velocity of vent flow with fresh air outside {{were recorded in}} tests under different smoke venting conditions. Experimental results have shown that efficiency of smoke venting is controlled {{by a combination of}} smoke buoyancy and drag force of sprinkler spray. Only when buoyancy is greater than drag force the smoke could be extracted by venting. Velocity of smoke venting has shown to decrease as the operating pressure increases. Smoke venting logging, which represents the failure of smoke venting, was experimentally found from certain operating pressure called initial logging pressure. The CO concentration was found to increase after sprinkler was operated as the smoke is constrained in the spray region with horizontal momentum decreased. Negative pressure difference is caused at the vent when there is smoke venting logging, which might practically bring the exterior fresh air into the fire building. Additionally, experiments results have shown that the venting area has little influence on smoke flow under smoke venting logging...|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of guidance available for design {{of heat and}} <b>smoke</b> building <b>vents</b> installed in buildings is restricted to nonsprinklered, single-story buildings.

40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of five different smoke extraction modes for an underground channel fire was numerically investigated originally in this paper. Results {{have shown that}} mechanical air supplying from adjacent smoke bays will intensify the air entrainment and increase the smoke production, which lead to a reduction of smoke temperature and buoyancy so that it's easier for smoke to descend to the lower level of the building space. The smoke exhausting process is not effective while using the <b>smoke</b> <b>vents</b> remote to the fire region as the fresh air is strongly sucked into the <b>vents</b> instead of <b>smoke.</b> Compared with the commonly used smoke extraction mode with all the smoke bays together, exhausting the fire-induced smoke with relatively high velocity by using the vents inside of or close to the fire is able to achieve a more effective smoke exhausting process. The most effective smoke extraction mode has also been validated by simulating a platform fire scenario in a full-scale subway station...|$|R
