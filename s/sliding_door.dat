5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} of the {{basement}} led to a <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) shows Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) a photo taken {{moments before}} Teddy's death, {{showing that the}} balloon moved {{horizontally}} against the wind. Chuck Burks (Bill Dow), a digital photo expert, uses software to uncover evidence of electromagnetic disturbances {{in the shape of}} a child, holding the balloon. During a visit by the agents, the Holveys adamantly dispute Mulder's theory that Teddy was led onto the tracks. Scully sees Golda (Lilyan Chauvin), Maggie's elderly Romanian mother, drawing a swastika on Charlie’s hand. Scully hypothesizes that the Holvey children may be victims of Munchausen by proxy, perpetrated by their grandmother. At a meeting with Steve Holvey, he explains that Golda was against his marriage to Maggie, and that strange things began to happen when Teddy was born and Golda came to live with the family. Steve hints that Golda might be hurting Charlie, leading Scully to suggest that they visit a social worker named Karen Kosseff (Christine Willes). When preparing to leave for a session with Kosseff, Steve and Charlie get in the car but the garage <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> seems to be malfunctioning, making Steve to step out and take a double-sided ladder to reset the sliding door's motor but in doing so, his tie is caught in the door rails with the motor suddenly starting, strangling and hanging him. Meanwhile Charlie, having been mysteriously locked in the car, starts crying over his father's death.|$|E

25|$|Minibus: Designed {{to carry}} fewer people than a {{full-size}} bus, generally up to 16 people in multiple rows of seats. Passenger access in normally via a <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> {{on one side}} of the vehicle. One example of a van with a minibus version available is the Ford Transit.|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{sliding doors}} {{are open and}} closed either by power, spring, or by a sensor. This {{eliminates}} the need for a person to open or close a door by turning a doorknob or pressing up against a bar on the door itself. Automatic sliding doors are commonly found at entrance and exits of supermarkets, department stores, and airport terminals. In 1954, Dee Horton and Lew Hewitt co-invented the automatic <b>sliding</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{screen door}} {{can refer to}} a hinged storm door (cold climates) or hinged screen door (warm climates) {{covering}} an exterior door; or a screened <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> used with sliding glass doors. In any case, the screen door incorporates screen mesh to block flying insects from entering and pets and small children from exiting interior spaces, while allowing for air, light, and views. The screen door was invented in 1887 by Hannah Harger.|$|E

25|$|These Orlit {{structures}} were {{split into two}} sections. The entrance door led into the smaller roofed section which {{was used as a}} shelter and store with a <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> into the open section which housed the post instrument and chart on top of a wooden mounting. Two types of Orlit posts existed, the Orlit ‘A’ was at ground level and the Orlit ‘B’ was raised 6ft on four legs with a ladder for access.|$|E
25|$|The first Type 192 {{prototype}} XG447 flew on 5 July 1958 with tandem wooden rotor blades, {{a completely}} manual control {{system and a}} castored, fixed quadricycle undercarriage. From the fifth prototype, the rotors fitted were all-metal, four-bladed units. Production model controls and instruments allowed night operations. The prototype machines had an upwards-hinged main passenger and cockpit door, which was prone to being slammed shut by the downwash from the rotors. This {{was replaced by a}} <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> on the later aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The burial chamber has a base {{measurement}} of 29ft x 17ft and {{a height of}} 15ft. It was also left unfinished, but surprisingly a nearly completely arranged burial was found. The sarcophagus {{in the midst of}} the chamber is made of polished alabaster and shows an unusual feature: its opening lies at the front side and is sealed by a <b>sliding</b> <b>door,</b> which was still plastered with mortar when the sarcophagus was found. The sarcophagus was empty, however and it remains unclear whether the site was ransacked after burial or whether King Sekhemkhet was buried elsewhere.|$|E

50|$|The second {{generation}} was praised for its powerful V6, its handling from its four-wheel independent suspension, and its {{features such as}} a large cabin, power <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> (manual <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> on LX models) and the stow-away third-row seat. Some found it noisier than competitors. It won consecutive Edmunds.com Editors' Most Wanted awards from 1999-2003 in the minivan category.|$|R
25|$|The {{passenger}} {{doors are}} higher than on normal buses so that passengers can only board from designated shelters. The doors employ automated swing and slide mechanisms which is manually controlled by the driver. Currently, the slide mechanism is being phased out, with all new buses being equipped with swing doors. Protective full-height acrylic glass barriers are installed behind passenger seats close to the <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> mechanism. Although, feeder routes uses low street-level doors. This is achieved with the driver's door {{at the front of}} the bus on big buses and a pair of designated hydaulic folding door on medium buses.|$|E
25|$|After unsuccessfully {{attempting}} to entice Schaefer into their van with alternate offers {{of marijuana and}} a lift home, Bittaker and Norris drove further ahead and parked alongside a driveway. Norris then exited the vehicle, opened the passenger-side <b>sliding</b> <b>door,</b> and leaned into the van, with his head and shoulders obscured from view behind the door. When Lucinda Schaefer passed the van, Norris exchanged a few words with her before dragging her into the van and closing the door. Using a ruse they would repeat in most of their subsequent murders, Bittaker turned the radio to full volume as Norris bound the victim's {{arms and legs and}} gagged her with duct tape as Bittaker drove Schaefer to the fire road in the San Gabriel Mountains where, in April, the pair had previously switched the locks.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after {{entering}} the van, both girls realized that Bittaker had steered the van off the Pacific Coast Highway and was {{driving in the}} direction of the San Gabriel Mountains. When the girls protested, both Bittaker and Norris attempted to allay the girls' concerns with excuses, which did not deceive either girl. Lamp, aged 13, attempted to open the <b>sliding</b> <b>door,</b> whereupon Norris hit her on the back of the head with a bag filled with lead weights, briefly knocking her unconscious, before overpowering 15-year-old Jackie Gilliam. As he began to bind and gag Gilliam, Jacqueline Lamp regained consciousness and again attempted to flee the van, whereupon Norris twisted her arm behind her back and dragged her back into the van. As this struggle ensued, Bittaker—noting the girls' struggle was in full view of potential witnesses—stopped the van, punched Gilliam in the face, and assisted Norris in finishing binding and gagging the two girls.|$|E

500|$|The ship {{remained}} on the station until late August 1939, when the imminent start of the Second World War caused the Admiralty to order her to take up her war station with the Mediterranean Fleet at Malta. Duchess arrived there on 12 October and remained in the Mediterranean {{for the next two}} months. In December the ship, along with her sisters , [...] and , was assigned to escort the battleship HMS Barham back to the UK, and they departed Gibraltar on 6 December. During the morning of 12 December, Barham collided with Duchess off the Mull of Kintyre in heavy fog. The destroyer capsized and her depth charges exploded, killing 124 of her crew including her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Robin White, who was stuck in his sea cabin when the <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> jammed.|$|E
