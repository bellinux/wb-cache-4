2500|$|The Guardian on 24 August 1945 called Animal Farm [...] "a delightfully humorous and caustic satire on {{the rule}} of the many by the few". Tosco Fyvel, writing in Tribune on the same day, called the book [...] "a gentle satire on a certain State and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us." [...] Julian Symons responded, on 7 September, [...] "Should we not expect, in Tribune at least, {{acknowledgement}} {{of the fact that it}} is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular State—Soviet Russia? It seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify Napoleon with Stalin, and Snowball with Trotsky, and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author, upon a political ground. In a hundred years time perhaps, Animal Farm may be simply a fairy <b>story,</b> <b>today</b> it is a political satire with a good deal of point." ...|$|E

25|$|A Purim spiel was {{historically}} a comic dramatization that {{attempted to}} convey the saga of the Purim story.

Indeed, by the mid-19th century, some were even based on other biblical <b>stories.</b> <b>Today,</b> Purim spiels can revolve around anything relating to Jews and Judaism that will bring cheer and comic relief to an audience celebrating the day.|$|R
