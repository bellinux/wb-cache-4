5|$|A partial cranial endocast for RAM 14000 was reconstructed from CT <b>scan</b> <b>data,</b> {{the first}} ever for a Parasaurolophus of any ontogenetic stage. The endocast was reconstructed in two sections, one on {{the portion of the}} braincase {{articulated}} with the left half of the skull and the remainder on the disarticulated portion of the braincase. Their relative position was then approximated based on cranial landmarks and comparison with other hadrosaurids. Because of weathering, many of the smaller neural canals and foramina could not be identified for certain.|$|E

40|$|Imagery {{and laser}} <b>scanning</b> <b>data</b> {{are two major}} sources of 3 D information. Each dataset has {{distinct}} characteristics that render it preferable for certain applications. The fusion of imagery and laser <b>scanning</b> <b>data</b> is a prerequisite to utilising the complementary characteristics of both datasets. In the past decade, a number of methods {{have been developed for}} the geometrical fusion of the two types of datasets for better 3 D mapping in various applications. This article presents a systematic review of these methods. First, comparative analysis of the derivation of 3 D information from imagery through photogrammetry and laser scanning is presented. Then, three categories of methods for the geometric fusion of imagery and laser <b>scanning</b> <b>data</b> are detailed, namely, laser <b>scanning</b> <b>data</b> used as controls for imagery, imagery used as controls for laser <b>scanning</b> <b>data</b> and the combined adjustment of imagery and laser <b>scanning</b> <b>data.</b> The advantages and limitations of the three categories of methods are analysed. Finally, suggestions for future research in this area are discussed, and concluding remarks are given. Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatic...|$|R

It presented an approximate set of <b>scanned</b> <b>data</b> points with a simple curves or surfaces. In this paper, the reverse engineering use for scanning the spur gear using 3 D laser scanner and data is stored in point cloud format. Using this <b>scanned</b> <b>data,</b> reconstructing the smooth curve is achieved by proposed algorithm in MATLAB environment. In this study, scanned geometry and curve reconstruction technique suggested and it has been demonstrated to tooth curve reconstruction of spur gear as a complex surface object.

2500|$|In 2004, {{historian}} Giuseppe Pallanti published Monna Lisa, Mulier Ingenua (published in English as Mona Lisa Revealed: The True Identity of Leonardo's Model). The book gathered archival {{evidence in}} support of the traditional identification of the model as Lisa. According to Pallanti, the evidence suggests that Leonardo's father was a friend of del Giocondo: [...] "The portrait of Mona Lisa, done when Lisa del Giocondo was aged about 24, was probably commissioned by Leonardo's father himself for his friends as he is known to have done on at least one other occasion." [...] In 2007, genealogist Domenico Savini identified the princesses Natalia and Irina Strozzi as descendants of Lisa del Giocondo. <b>Scan</b> <b>data</b> obtained in 2004 suggested that the painting dated from around 1503 and commemorated the birth of the Giocondo's second son.|$|E
2500|$|A JPEG image {{consists}} of a sequence of segments, each beginning with a marker, each of which begins with a 0xFF byte followed by a byte indicating what kind of marker it is. Some markers consist of just those two bytes; others are followed by two bytes (high then low) indicating the length of marker-specific payload data that follows. (The length includes the two bytes for the length, but not the two bytes for the marker.) Some markers are followed by entropy-coded data; the length of such a marker {{does not include the}} entropy-coded data. Note that consecutive 0xFF bytes are used as fill bytes for padding purposes, although this fill byte padding should only ever take place for markers immediately following entropy-coded <b>scan</b> <b>data</b> (see JPEG specification section B.1.1.2 and E.1.2 for details; specifically [...] "In all cases where markers are appended after the compressed data, optional 0xFF fill bytes may precede the marker").|$|E

40|$|Methodologies for {{automatic}} building {{roof extraction}} {{are important in}} the context of spatial information acquisition for geographical information systems (GIS). Thus, this work proposes a methodology for roof contour extraction from laser <b>scanning</b> <b>data</b> by Markov Random Field model. The methodology is based on extraction of high regions (buildings, trees etc.) from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from laser <b>scanning</b> <b>data,</b> and building roof contour extraction. The high object polygons are extracted by using vectorization and polygonization techniques. The building roof contours are identified among all high objects extracted previously. Taking into account some roof properties and some feature measurements (e. g., area, rectangularity, and angles between principal axes of objects), an energy function was developed based on the Markov Random Field (MRF) model. The solution of this function is a polygon set corresponding to building roof contours and is found by using a minimization technique, like the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm. The data area consists of a regular grid obtained by interpoling a laser <b>scanning</b> <b>data</b> set from Curitiba/PR city. The test area with different object configuration complexities was tested. Experiments carried out with laser <b>scanning</b> <b>data's</b> DEM showed that the methodology allows discriminating the urban objects in the scene properly. Pages: 5023 - 503...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, renovations {{of plant}} {{equipment}} {{have been more}} frequent, and constructing 3 D as-built models of existing plants from large-scale laser <b>scanned</b> <b>data</b> {{is expected to make}} rebuilding processes more efficient. However, laser <b>scanned</b> <b>data</b> consists of enormous number of points, captures tangled objects and includes a high noise level, so that the manual reconstruction of a 3 D model is very time-consuming. Among plant equipment, piping systems especially account for the greatest proportion. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to propose an algorithm which can automatically recognize a piping system from large-scale laser <b>scanned</b> <b>data</b> of plants. The straight portion of pipes, connecting parts and connection relationship of the piping system can be automatically recognized. Normal-based region growing enables the extraction of points on the piping system. Eigen analysis of the normal tensor and cylinder surface fitting allows the algorithm to recognize portions of straight pipes. Tracing the axes of the piping system and interpolation of the axes can derive connecting parts and connection relationships between elements of the piping system. The algorithm was applied to large-scale <b>scanned</b> <b>data</b> of an oil rig and a chemical plant. The recognition rate of straight pipes, elbows, junctions achieved 93...|$|R
