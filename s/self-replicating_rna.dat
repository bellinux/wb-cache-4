5|$|How life {{originated}} from inorganic matter remains an unresolved problem in biology. One prominent {{hypothesis is that}} life {{first appeared in the}} form of short <b>self-replicating</b> <b>RNA</b> polymers. On this view, life may have come into existence when RNA chains first experienced the basic conditions, as conceived by Charles Darwin, for natural selection to operate. These conditions are: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources. The fitness of an early RNA replicator would likely have been a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (i.e., determined by the nucleotide sequence) and the availability of resources. The three primary adaptive capacities could logically have been: (1) the capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type), (2) the capacity to avoid decay, and (3) the capacity to acquire and process resources. These capacities would have been determined initially by the folded configurations (including those configurations with ribozyme activity) of the RNA replicators that, in turn, would have been encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences.|$|E

In addition, evidence strongly points to ancient ribosomes as self-replicating complexes, where the rRNA in the ribosomes had informational, structural, and catalytic purposes because it could have coded for tRNAs and proteins needed for ribosomal self-replication.

A relatively small genome size and simple procedure allow rapid generation of recombinants. Cytoplasmic RNA amplification eliminates nuclear involvement and leads to extremely high levels of gene expression, and continuous synthesis of double stranded RNA results in induction of enhanced immune responses, making these vectors unique among other gene expression systems.

40|$|In vitro {{expansion}} of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is a challenging task since these cells tend to differentiate under culture conditions resulting in {{loss of their}} stem cell character. Possibilities to enhance HSPC self-renewal involve intrinsic regulators such as transcription factors or microRNAs (miRNAs) but also extrinsic stimulation by signalling molecules. Most attempts for intrinsic stimulation of HSPC proliferation utilise stable gene modification such as viral vectors that are still controversial in clinical settings as they harbour the risk of insertional mutagenesis. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate new approaches to modify HSPC gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by using novel and established RNA-based molecules. First, various transfection methods were tested to deliver non-integrating RNA molecules into HSPCs. Standard chemical transfection methods including lipofection for delivery of siRNAs targeting surface markers {{did not lead to}} protein knockdown although more than 90 % of fluorescent cells were detected using a fluorescently labelled control siRNA. By means of confocal microscopy, we showed that the siRNA-reagent complexes stuck to or inside the cell membrane after transfection, thereby mimicking a transfection event. In contrast, efficient siRNA-mediated protein knockdown was achieved using electroporation, proving that this is the method of choice for HSPC transfection. For RNA-mediated HSPC expansion, the function of selected candidate miRNAs was modulated by electroporation of specific inhibitors or mimics. Enhancement of miRNA 125 b and miRNA- 99 a function or inhibition of miRNA 142 3 p slightly increased the {{expansion of}} HSPCs compared to a scrambled negative control. Serum taken from patients after chemotherapy has previously been shown to stimulate HSPC expansion. In this study, microarray analysis of miRNAs circulating in serum indicated that miRNAs are differentially expressed in serum before and after therapy. However, a combination of different soluble factors rather than a single miRNA probably is responsible for the observed growth-promoting effect. Overexpression of regulatory proteins such as HOXB 4 using mRNAs was efficient but presumably too short-lived to significantly impact on HSPC behaviour. Novel, <b>self-replicating</b> <b>RNAs</b> resulted in prolonged protein expression, offering new opportunities for DNA-free gene modulation in HSPCs. Preliminary data suggest that overexpression of the epigenetic modifier BMI 1 by <b>self-replicating</b> <b>RNAs</b> could prevent stem cell loss in vitro, but its effect on HSPC expansion has to be investigated more in detail in future studies. As an extrinsic approach for HSPC expansion, the Notch ligand Delta like 4 (Dll 4) was coupled to beads and added to long-term cultures. This system promoted the expansion of primitive HSPC subpopulations in a stromal cell- and serum-free culture system. In conclusion, non-integrating intrinsic HSPC modulation in combination with extrinsic stimulation might be the key to successful in vitro expansion of HSPCs...|$|R

The full-length viral cDNA, propagated within a bacterial artificial chromosome, was modified by targeted recombination within Escherichia coli. RNA transcripts were produced in vitro and introduced into cells by electroporation. The translation and replication of the replicon RNAs could be followed by the accumulation of luciferase (from Renilla reniformis or Gaussia princeps) protein expression (where appropriate), {{as well as by}} detection of CSFV NS 3 protein production within the cells. Inclusion of the viral E 2 coding region within the replicon was advantageous for replication efficiency. Production of chimeric RNAs, substituting the NS 2 and NS 3 coding regions (as a unit) from the Paderborn strain with the equivalent sequences from the highly virulent Koslov strain or the vaccine strain Riems, blocked replication. However, replacing the Paderborn NS 5 B coding sequence with the RNA polymerase coding sequence from the Koslov strain greatly enhanced expression of the reporter protein from the replicon. In contrast, replacement with the Riems NS 5 B sequence significantly impaired replication efficiency.

Recent experimental data {{have led to}} the suggestive proposal of a pathogenic model based on the RNA silencing mechanism. However, evidence of a direct relation between key components of the RNA silencing pathway and symptom expression in infected plants remains elusive. To address this issue, we used a symptomatic transgenic line of Nicotiana benthamiana that expresses and processes dimeric forms of Hop stunt viroid (HSVd). These plants were analyzed under different growing temperature conditions and were used as stocks in grafting assays with the rdr 6 i-Nb line, in which the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR 6) is constitutively silenced. Here, we show that the symptom expression in N. benthamiana plants is independent of HSVd accumulation levels but dependent on an active state of the viroid-specific RNA silencing pathway. The scion of rdr 6 i-Nb plants remained asymptomatic when grafted onto symptomatic plants, despite an accumulation of a high level of mature forms of HSVd, indicating the requirement of RDR 6 for viroid-induced symptom production. In addition, the RDR 6 requirement for symptom expression was also observed in wild-type N. benthamiana plants mechanically infected with HSVd. These results provide biological evidence of the involvement of the viroid-specific RNA silencing pathway in the symptom expression associated with viroid pathogenesis...|$|R

40|$|The {{discovery}} of catalytic RNA suggested {{a way out}} of a troublesome problem concerning the origin of life (Gilbert 1986). Given the known roles of the various biological informational molecules, it had been un-clear how a genetic system could ever have gotten started. The replica-tion of a nucleic acid would require a proteinaceous polymerase, but without replication, nothing, protein synthesis included, could evolve. Put another way, there was no molecule known that could both serve as a template for replication and express its information without some sort of translation, in the loose sense of the word. The {{discovery of}} modern catalytic RNA demonstrated in dramatic fashion that RNA could be such a molecule. The first nucleic acid polymerase, it is hypothesized, was an RNA molecule that catalyzed its own replication. Such <b>self-replicating</b> <b>RNAs</b> were the first genetic systems and might well be called the first living things. Once there were replicators, there was selection. Whereas the first selection-driven changes probably were "improvements " to polymerase activity, eventually metabolic innovations arose, including template-directed protein synthesis. The precursor of the modern ribosome, then, was a purely, or mostly, RNA-based system, confirming early suspicions about the origins of rRNA, mRNA, and tRNA (Woese 1967; Crick 1968; Orgel 1968). The fact that the modern translational ap-paratus contains so much RNA is explained by such an origin of transla-tion. In fact, it is tempting to think of ribosomal RNA as catalytic RNA, and experimental evidence indicates {{that at least some of}} the ribosome's activities are associated with ribosomal RNA rather than ribosomal protein (Noller 1991 a). This discussion of the evolution of translation considers how translation might have arisen in the "RNA World.

Some viruses use RNA as their genetic material, rather than DNA.

IFN-α treatment of replicon-containing cells results in a rapid loss of viral RNA via translation inhibition through double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and also through a new pathway involving RNA editing by an adenosine deaminase that acts on double-stranded RNA (ADAR 1). More than 200 genes are induced by IFN-α, and yet only a few are attributed with an antiviral role.

This is the first report of ADAR's involvement in a potent antiviral pathway and its action to specifically eliminate HCV RNA through adenosine to inosine editing.
