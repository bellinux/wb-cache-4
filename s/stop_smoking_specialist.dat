40|$|Introduction: Smokers {{receiving}} {{support in}} specialist centres {{tend to have}} a higher short-term quit rate, compared with those receiving support in other settings from professionals for whom smoking cessation is only a part of their work. We investigated the difference in longer-term abstinence after short-term smoking cessation treatment from <b>specialist</b> and non-specialist <b>smoking</b> cessation services. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a randomised controlled trial of self-help booklets for the prevention of smoking relapse. The trial included 1, 088 short-term quitters from <b>specialist</b> <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> clinics and 316 from non-specialist cessation services (such as general practice, pharmacies, and health trainer services). The difference in prolonged smoking abstinence from months four to 12 between specialist and non-specialist services was compared. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the association between continuous smoking abstinence and the type of smoking cessation services, adjusted for possible confounding factors (including demographic, socioeconomic, and smoking history variables). Results: The proportion of continuous abstinence from four to 12 months was higher in short-term quitters from specialist services compared with those from non-specialist services (39 % vs. 32 %; P= 0. 023). After adjusting for a range of participant characteristics and <b>smoking</b> variables, the <b>specialist</b> service was significantly associated with a higher rate of longer-term smoking abstinence (odds ratio 1. 48, 95 % CI: 1. 09 to 2. 00; P= 0. 011). Conclusions: People who receive support to <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> from a <b>specialist</b> appear to be at lower risk of relapse than those receiving support from a non-specialist advisor...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of cigarette smoking in Ukraine is different between genders and {{is among the}} highest in the world. There is need to identify gender-specific factors that are associated with having <b>stopped</b> <b>smoking</b> among adolescents. Findings: We used data from the Ukraine Global Youth Tobacco Survey 2005. We carried out a backward stepwise logistic regression analysis with having <b>stopped</b> <b>smoking</b> as the outcome. Altogether, 2800 adolescents reported having ever smoked cigarettes. Overall 64. 1 % (63. 4 % male, and 65. 5 % female) adolescents reported having <b>stopped</b> <b>smoking.</b> Male adolescents who stated that smoking decreases body weight were 25 % more likely, while female adolescents were 9 % less likely to <b>stop</b> <b>smoking.</b> While male adolescents who received support on how to <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> from a family member were 7 % less likely, female adolescents were 60 % more likely to <b>stop</b> <b>smoking.</b> Furthermore, while male adolescents who received a lecture on the harmful effects of smoking were 10 % less likely, female adolescents were 9 % more likely to <b>stop</b> <b>smoking.</b> Finally both male and female adolescents who were sure or most probably that they would not smoke a cigarette offered to them by their best friends were more likely, and those adolescents who were sure that smoking is harmful to health were less likely to <b>stop</b> <b>smoking...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to identify how midwives perceive providing <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> advice to pregnant smokers and how pregnant women who smoke perceive <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> services. The overall aim was to find methods to improve the uptake of <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> services by pregnant women. Three focus groups with midwives and ten semi-structured interviews with pregnant smokers were undertaken. The qualitative data was analysed using Grounded Theory. The perceptions of midwives regarding provision of advice were identified as barriers as well as facilitators and related to outcome of advice, the relationship with clients, personal experiences, attributes, perception of role, the impact of external factors and aspects related to pregnant smokers and pregnancy. Pregnant smokers’ perceived barriers and facilitators to approaching <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> services were categorised into areas of smoking behaviour, advice from health professionals, <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> services and negative perceptions of pregnant women who smoke. Midwives perceive a greater number of barriers than facilitators to providing <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> advice. Although many of these could be overcome by implementing effective mandatory training, other issues such as lack of time have major impacts on midwives’ abilities to promote health. Pregnant smokers tend to have negative expectations of <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> services but the experiences of those who have attended the service are positive.

40|$|Background: Smoking is {{the cause}} of a great deal of {{morbidity}} and mortality. General practitioners (GPs) can help prevent smoking-related diseases by following an active anti-smoking policy, i. e. by taking the initiative to discuss <b>stopping</b> <b>smoking</b> with their patients. The aim of our research is to gain insight into several aspects of advice on <b>stopping</b> <b>smoking</b> in Dutch general practice. Methods: In the Netherlands a representative number of GPs participate in the Dutch Sentinel Practice Network. In 2005, participants in this network (n= 49) were asked to fill in a short questionnaire for each consultation in which advice on <b>stopping</b> <b>smoking</b> was given. Results: 474 initial recommendations that the patient <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> were given, representing approximately 2. 6 recommendations per 100 adult (15 +) smokers in the Netherlands. The initiative to discuss <b>stopping</b> <b>smoking</b> was more frequently taken by GPs (54 %) as against patients (42 %). GPs tend to discuss <b>stopping</b> <b>smoking</b> particularly in cases of smoking-related symptoms (e. g. cough) or when the smoker belongs to a highrisk group (smokers with COPD, hypertension or cardiovascular disease). Smokers themselves bring up the subject of smoking for preventive reasons or because of smoking-related symptoms (e. g. cough). Even when the GP takes the initiative to recommend <b>stopping</b> <b>smoking,</b> at least 72 % of the patients appear (moderately) motivated to stop. The strategies most often used by GPs are verbal advice or prescribing a drug. Discussion: GPs are encouraged to initiate the "stop smoking" discussion with their patients more frequently. Furthermore, the Minimal Intervention strategy <b>Stop</b> <b>smoking</b> (MIS), a relatively effective method to help the patient to <b>stop</b> <b>smoking,</b> could be used more often.

For adult smokers, there is strong evidence that group behavioural support enhances quit rates.

Findings A cluster randomised trial for young people trying to <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> to compare the efficacy of a school-based 9 week intensive group behavioural support course versus a school-based 7 week brief advice only course. Participants were assessed for evidence of tobacco addiction and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) was used if it was deemed appropriate by the therapist. Both types of course aimed to recruit approximately one hundred participants from approximately ten schools. The primary outcome was successful quitting at 4 weeks after quit day judged according to the Russell standard.

The mainstay of National Health Service smoking cessation strategy should be the routine provision of brief opportunistic intervention in primary care, backed up by referral to a <b>specialist</b> <b>smoking</b> cessation service. There is an urgent need to increase substantially the numbers of smokers referred by general practitioners, other members of the primary care team, and those working in acute hospital trusts, to <b>specialist</b> <b>smoking</b> cessation services and for better channels of communication between the various agencies.

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} {{about the extent to which}} smokers {{attending}} stop-smoking clinics experience conflicting motivations about their quit attempt, whether such conflict can be understood in terms of a single dimension and if this 'conflict about quitting' differs from motivation to <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> and is associated with a smoker's choice of method to <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> (<b>stopping</b> gradually or abruptly). Method: Sociodemographic, smoking and quit attempt characteristics as well as measures relating to conflict about <b>stopping</b> <b>smoking</b> were recorded in a cross-sectional survey of 198 smokers attending five quit smoking clinics in Malaysia. Results: Five measures (having seriously thought about quitting before, being happy about becoming a non-smoker, being strongly motivated to stop, intending to <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> completely and believing in stopping for good this time) were loaded onto a single factor that could be labelled 'conflict about quitting'. The resultant scale had moderate internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha =. 625). Most smokers exhibited conflicting motivations about <b>stopping</b> <b>smoking,</b> with over half (52. 0, 95 CI 45. 1 - 59. 1) scoring 2 or higher on the 5 -point conflict scale. 'Conflict about quitting' was significantly associated with the decision to <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> gradually rather than abruptly controlling for other variables (OR 1. 36, 95 CI 1. 05 - 1. 76) and was more strongly associated with the choice of smoking cessation method than motivation to <b>stop</b> <b>smoking.</b> Conclusions: 'Conflict about quitting' can be conceptualised as a single dimension and is prevalent among smokers voluntarily attending stop-smoking clinics. The finding that smokers who display greater conflict about quitting are more likely to choose gradual cessation may explain contradictory findings in the literature regarding the effectiveness of different methods of smoking cessation...|$|R

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} effect on {{mortality}} of <b>stopping</b> <b>smoking</b> after myocardial infarction and the psychosocial factors that influence the decision to stop. DESIGN [...] Analysis of smokers in a large prospective study. Self completed questionnaires provided information on psychosocial factors. SETTING [...] Coronary care units at six English hospitals participating in a multicentre clinical trial. SUBJECTS [...] These comprised consenting myocardial infarction survivors who had been identified as smokers and who completed questionnaires within seven days of infarct at six hospitals participating in the Anglo-Scandinavian study of early thrombolysis. The 532 patients identified have been followed for over {{five and a half}} years. The main outcome measure was five year all cause mortality. MAIN RESULTS [...] Smokers who stopped within one month showed significantly reduced mortality compared with those who persisted, adjusting for other prognostic indicators (odds ratio 0. 56, 95 % confidence interval 0. 33, 0. 98). Overall, 74 % <b>stopped</b> <b>smoking.</b> Being married, low life stress levels before infarct, and higher social class were associated with <b>stopping</b> <b>smoking</b> but the differentials were small. Of the clinical variables, a final diagnosis of definite myocardial infarction was associated with <b>stopping</b> <b>smoking.</b> All associations remained after multiple logistic regression.
