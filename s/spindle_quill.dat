40|$|Purpose. The {{research}} of complex influence of design, kitting, mounting, maintenance conditions, and elastic-dissipative properties of spindle units on mode shapes forming. Design/Methodology/Approach. Spindle unit {{considered to be}} mechanical vibration system, that consists of subsystems: tool (tool holder), spindle and <b>spindle</b> <b>quill</b> that is elastically mounted on machine tool bed. Designed model of mode shapes based on solving {{of the system of}} deformation compatibility equations in the points of subsystems disconnection, and force method canonical equations for displacements in characteristic points of subsystems. Findings. Subsystems mode shapes on system natural frequencies has been calculated, with taking into account dissipative characteristics of supports and subsystems joints. Analysis of the elastic curves shapes of system elements was carried out and regularity of their forming is established. Originality/value. It was established, that the largest level of spindle and quill vibration occurs on spindle natural frequency and ?spindle-quill? system combined frequency. ????????? ????????????? ???? ????????? ??????? ???????????? ?????. ??????????? ???? ??????????? ? ???? ???????????? ????????????? ???????, ????????? ?? ????????? ???????????

40|$|A novel {{approach}} to mitigating chatter vibrations in machine tools is presented. Encountered in {{many types of}} metal removal processes, chatter is a dangerous condition which results from {{the interaction of the}} cutting dynamics with the modal characteristics of the machine-workpiece assembly. Tool vibrations are recored {{on the surface of the}} workpiece during metal removal, imposing a waviness which alters the chip thickness during subsequent cutting passes. Deviations from the nominal chip thickness effect changes in the cutting force which, under certain conditions, can further excite vibrations. The chatter mitigation strategy presented is based on periodically altering the impedance of the cutting tool assembly. A cyclic electric (or magnetic) field is applied to the <b>spindle</b> <b>quill</b> which contains an electro-rheological (or magneto-rheological) fluid. The variable yield stress in the fluid affects the coupling of the spindle to the machine tool structure, changing the natural frequency of oscillation. Altering the modal characteristics in this fashion disrupts the modulation of current tool vibrations with previous tool vibrations recorded on the workpiece surface. Results from a simulated milling process reveal that significant reductions in vibration amplitude can be achieved through proper selection of fluid and excitation frequency...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{research}} of complex influence of design, kitting, mounting and maintenance conditions of spindle units on natural frequencies array formation. Design/Methodology/approach. Spindle unit is considered as mechanical vibration system, which consist of subsystems: tool (tool holder), spindle and <b>spindle</b> <b>quill</b> that is elastically mounted on machine tool bed. Constraints {{of the system}} are: tool holder - spindle joint for first and second subsystems and support bearings for second and third subsystems. Method of dynamical compliances is used {{in order to work}} out balance equations in points of subsystems disconnection. Dynamical compliances are determined by using method of initial parameters in matrix form (method of transfer matrices). Four cases of system kitting are considered: spindle on supports; spindle on supports with connected tool holder; quill on supports with connected spindle; spindle unit (whole kitting). Findings. Natural frequencies of ?spindle unit? system for four types of kitting, taking into account varying of the stiffness of bearings of the spindle supports and quill supports, are calculated. Originality/value. Results of analysis indicates about concrete regularity of natural frequencies array forming of the ?spindle unit? system, that associated with spindle unit kitting. Design, mounting and maintenance conditions of spindle units defines nature of change of this natural frequencies. ????????? ???????????? ???????????? ??????? ???????????, ????????????, ??????? ? ??????? ???????????? ??????????? ????? ?? ???????????? ??????? ?????? ??????????? ?????????. ??????????? ???? ??????????? ? ???? ???????????? ????????????? ???????, ????????? ?? ????????? ???????????

50|$|A {{drill press}} (also {{known as a}} {{pedestal}} drill, pillar drill, or bench drill) is a fixed style of drill that may be mounted on a stand or bolted to the floor or workbench. Portable models with a magnetic base grip the steel workpieces they drill. A drill press consists of a base, column (or pillar), table, <b>spindle</b> (or <b>quill),</b> and drill head, usually driven by an induction motor. The head has a set of handles (usually 3) radiating from a central hub that, when turned, move the spindle and chuck vertically, parallel to the axis of the column. The drill press is typically {{measured in terms of}} swing. Swing is defined as twice the throat distance, which is the distance {{from the center of the}} spindle to the closest edge of the pillar. For example, a 16 in drill press has an 8 in throat distance.|$|R
