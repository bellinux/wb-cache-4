Odin responds that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe, who will soon arrive in Valhalla. Odin tells the heroes Sigmund and Sinfjötli to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall, if it is indeed he.|$|E

Due to the disease, Artemis finds himself obsessed with the number 5 and fearing the number 4 (which in Chinese <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> word for death). The disease worsens throughout the novel, leading to his distrust of close friends. A neutrino shock from Holly Short frees Artemis' alter-ego Orion but he comes back after being knocked out by a buzz baton blow from Holly. He later undergoes Atlantis Complex Disease treatment by the fairies, curing him and restoring his former self.|$|E
25|$|The name Berlin has {{its roots}} in the {{language}} of West Slavic inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old Polabian stem berl-/birl- ("swamp"). The Elbe and Saale rivers constituting the former eastern border of the Frankish Realm, most of the villages east of these rivers are of Slavic origin (Germania Slavica). Typical place name endings of these villages are -ow, -itz, -itzsch, and -in. There are many boroughs of Slavic origin in the city: Berlin-Karow, Berlin-Malchow, Berlin-Pankow, Berlin-Spandau (earlier: Spandow), Berlin-Gatow, Berlin-Kladow, Berlin-Steglitz, Berlin-Lankwitz, Berlin-Britz, Berlin-Buckow, Berlin-Rudow, Berlin-Alt-Treptow, Berlin-Schmöckwitz, Berlin-Marzahn, Berlin-Buch, and Berlin-Köpenick. Since the Ber- at the beginning <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> German word Bär (bear), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city. It is therefore a canting arm.|$|E

500|$|Chris Broderick {{compared}} {{some parts}} of the album specifically to Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? (1986), Rust in Peace, or Countdown to Extinction (1992), but also stated [...] "I've been likening it to a very diverse CD. It's not one of those ones that you'll put it on and every song <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> last one. It's got everything from anthems to more radio friendly stuff to hard-hitting thrash and some cool, dark-sounding stuff." [...] In a later interview, Broderick again touted the sonic diversity of the album, noting that it is [...] "like a cut in time from each CD of the past Megadeth discography".|$|E
500|$|On November 26, 2002, {{the group}} {{released}} its second album, Does This Look Infected? The special edition {{came with a}} DVD, Cross The T's and Gouge Your I's. Whibley said of the album: [...] "We don't want to make another record that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> last record, I hate when bands repeat albums." [...] The album featured a harder and edgier sound, and the lyrics featured a more serious outlook. The album peaked at No.32 on the Billboard 200 chart and at No.8 on the Top Canadian Albums chart. The album was certified Platinum in Canada and gold in the United States, but was not as successful as its predecessor.|$|E

[...] Elysa Gardner of USA Today was more {{critical}} of the song, calling it [...] "breathless" [...] and [...] "colorless". She also added that the song [...] "sounds less like the edgy, strong-but-vulnerable-woman number it purports to be than the Christina Aguilera throwaway it basically is." [...] The song received a nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 2004 Grammy Awards, but lost out to Aguilera's [...] "Beautiful". It was also nominated for Choice Summer Song at the 2003 Teen Choice Awards.|$|E
500|$|Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone {{considered}} it the band's catchiest music since their heyday, summarizing, [...] "At its best, California shows Blink trying {{new ways to}} freshen up yesterday's racket." [...] Jon Caramanica at The New York Times found it [...] "pleasantly familiar if not especially imaginative... the album [...] full of songs that have achieved their purpose by the halfway mark." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Spin felt DeLonge's presence was missed, describing it as [...] "fine, fun, and overall kinda meh." [...] Aidan Reynolds from Drowned in Sound noted [...] "California <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> work of a band filled with the joy of existence, giving in to every pop indulgence or production trick that could stuff in one more hook before the end. There are pick-scrapes and 'whoah-oh' backing vocals EVERYWHERE, and even the dumb, seconds-long throwaway tracks have their own charm." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Wilentz {{the final}} {{recording}} session, on March 9–10, produced six songs in 13 hours of studio time. The first number {{to be recorded}} to Dylan's satisfaction was [...] "Most Likely You Go Your Way and I'll Go Mine", when McCoy reinforced on trumpet a musical phrase Dylan played on his harmonica, changing {{the sound of the}} song radically. Dylan and his band then quickly recorded [...] "Temporary Like Achilles". The session atmosphere began to [...] "get giddy" [...] around midnight when Dylan roughed out [...] "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35" [...] on the piano. Johnston recalled commenting; [...] "That <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> damn Salvation Army band". Dylan replied; [...] "Can you get one?" [...] Johnston then telephoned trombonist Wayne Butler, the only additional musician required, and Dylan and the band, with McCoy again on trumpet, played a high-spirited version of the song.|$|E

500|$|Megan Gibson from Time was {{disappointed}} with the single, feeling {{that it was not}} [...] "particularly good", and called the music as trite, uninspiring and bland. Matthew Cole from Slant Magazine was polarized with the song, stating that while it lowered his expectations for the album, he expressed that the saxophone solo was [...] "admittedly a high point, and one of the more original ideas that Gaga has had of late." [...] Sal Cinquemani, from the same publication, felt that the song [...] "isn't retro so much as retrograde, starting off with some crafty Art of Noise synth tones before morphing into what <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> theme song to an early-'90s sitcom, or an inspirational sports flick, as sung by Bonnie Tyler." [...] Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune also gave a mixed review about the song, calling it a [...] "Springsteen-on-steroids bombast" [...] and adding that it features [...] "Clarence Clemons doing almost a parody of a Clarence Clemons sax solo." ...|$|E
500|$|In a very {{positive}} review, Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly highlighted {{the depth of the}} group's interplay, commenting that [...] "Tucker explores what her voice can do when it's not in overdrive, stretching vowels like a religious supplicant or spewing prosody like Patti Smith. At the same time, Brownstein blossoms as a singer herself [...] braiding lines with Tucker so artfully the result <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> voicings of a single restless mind". He considered The Hot Rock as Sleater-Kinney's [...] "most finely turned record" [...] and that its music [...] "never falters". Peter Tarizan of Out magazine credited the work of the producer for polishing the band's sound without losing its intensity or muscle. The album appeared at number 23 in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1999. Similarly, Spin placed The Hot Rock at number 18 in its list of [...] "The Top 20 Albums of 1999". In 2002, Rolling Stone ranked the album at number 17 on its list of [...] "Women in Rock: The 50 Essential Albums".|$|E

They worked on it again during the joint sessions for Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001). During this time, guitarist Ed O'Brien kept an online diary of the band's progress, and wrote in January 2000: [...] " [...] has been kicking around for about four years now and each time we approached it we {{seemed to be going}} down the same old paths. It actually <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> start of something exciting now." [...] One month later, he wrote: [...] "This is something like approach number 561 but it is a great song. It's simply {{trying to find a way}} of doing it which excites us. And we may have found a way, at the very least we've found a new approach … It may of course be utter crap and we have so lost the plot on this song. Please don't let that be the case." [...] The band failed to find an arrangement that satisfied them, and the song remained unreleased.|$|E

500|$|Edna Gundersen of USA Today {{criticized the}} use of pick-up lines, but said the single [...] "delivers enough dizzying dance-pop ecstasy to ensure another chart-topping ride." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com called it [...] "one of the most mature dance pop songs" [...] of Spears' career, praising the chorus {{structure}} and the electropop bridge. Lamb stated, [...] "The pop music of 2011 has an early {{shot in the arm}} here. [...] will quickly take its place among Britney Spears' best singles." [...] Music website Popjustice positively compared the song to the leaked demo, saying that although the lyrics and melody were not different, Spears' finished version [...] "is approximately 1000 times better than the demo. It's a harder, more urgent, extremely epic statement track that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> work of a superstar." [...] Glenn Gamboa of Newsday stated that [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] was [...] "a bit safer [...] like her current low-key, non-tabloid persona."

500|$|Despite his reservations, in October 2011 Virtanen {{cooperated with}} another scholar, Vesa Sirén, to prepare {{three of the}} more {{developed}} fragments for performance. The sketches were copied and tidied, but nothing not written by Sibelius {{was added to the}} material. Permission from the Sibelius Rights Holders was secured, and John Storgårds, chief conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic, agreed to play and record these excerpts at the orchestra's rehearsal session on 30 October 2011. The pieces comprise an opening segment of about a minute's duration, an eight-second fragment that might be part of a scherzo, and a final scrap of orchestral music again lasting roughly a minute. Sirén describes the music as [...] "strange, powerful, and with daring, spicy harmonies—a step into the new even after Tapiola and the music for The Tempest". Stearns gives a more detailed insight: [...] "The first excerpt is classic Sibelian announcement of a first movement. There's a genteel orchestral thunderclap that throws open the door to a harmonic world that is Sibelius' alone, but has strange dissonances unlike any other work. Another glimpse <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> beginning of a scherzo, surprisingly spring-like with a buoyant flute solo. Another snippet has a classic Sibelian bassoon solo, the sort that speaks of primal things and goes to a dark, wintry underworld." ...|$|E
500|$|For bass guitar playing, About.com's Melissa Bobbitt {{highlights}} the bass work of The Smashing Pumpkins' D'arcy Wretzky. Bobbitt states {{that in the}} song [...] "I Am One", Wretsky's [...] "...combative bass line" [...] and [...] "slinky delivery" [...] (i.e., playing style) on electric bass [...] "...was the glue that held [...] all together". Bobbitt also praises Alice in Chains bassist Mike Starr’s bass playing on the EP [...] "Would?". She states that Starr's [...] "...bass line <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> slithering coil of the dragon that is heroin...". [...] "Would?"

NME states that Nirvana's bassist Krist Novoselic's [...] "...dirty, sliding bass lines anchor the grunge chaos around him" [...] created by singer-guitarist Kurt Cobain and drummer Dave Grohl. TAD's Kurt Danielson stated that he was [...] "...completely blown away [...] Krist's bass playing." [...] The early Seattle grunge album Skin Yard recorded in 1987 by the band of the same name included fuzz bass (overdriven bass guitar) played by Jack Endino and Daniel House. Some grunge bassists, such as Ben Shepherd, layered power chords with distorted low-end density by adding a fifth and an octave-higher note to a bass note.|$|E
