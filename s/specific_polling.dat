In 2008, Peter Boyce wrote that successive polls since the 1990s showed an increasing disaffection with the monarchy, but also noted internal contradictions in <b>specific</b> <b>poll</b> results. Polls on the institution {{have been accused}} of using [...] "inconsistent and sometimes ambiguous wording." [...] Monarchists assert the use of the inaccurate word [...] "British" [...] in a poll question on the Canadian monarchy skews the results, while republicans say the same about the use of [...] "sever" [...] or [...] "abolish". It has also been noted, and confirmed by polls, that Canadians are not well educated about the monarchy and its role. In 2002, the majority polled thought the prime minister was head of state, only 5% knowing it was the Queen. Both republicans and monarchists in Canada have noted this fact in relation to polls on the monarchy.|$|R

WashburnThis thesis reports our attempt towards {{achieving}} a phase stabilized free-space nonlinear polarization rotation (NPR) mode locked erbium doped fiber laser frequency comb system. Optical frequency combs generated by mode-locked femtosecond fiber lasers are vital tools for ultra-precision frequency metrology and molecular spectroscopy. However, the comb bandwidth and average output power become {{the two main}} limiting elements {{in the application of}} femtosecond optical frequency combs. We have specifically investigated the free-space mode locking dynamics of erbium-doped fiber (EDF) mode-locked ultrafast lasers via nonlinear polarization rotation (NPR) in the normal dispersion regime. To do so, we built a passively mode-locked fiber laser based on NPR with a repetition rate of 89 MHz producing an octave-spanning spectrum due to supercontinuum (SC) generation in highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF). Most significantly, we have achieved highly stable self-starting NPR mode-locked femtosecond fiber laser based frequency comb which has been running mode locked for the past one year without any need to redo the mode locking. By using the free-space NPR comb scheme, we have not only shortened the cavity length, but also have obtained 5 to 10 times higher output power (more than 30 mW at central wavelength of 1570 nm) and much broader spectral comb bandwidth (about 54 nm) compared to conventional all-fiber cavity structure with less than 1 mW average output power and only 10 nm spectral bandwidth. The pulse output from the NPR comb is amplified through a 1 m long EDF, then compressed by a length of anomalous dispersion fiber to a near transform limited pulse duration. The amplified transform limited pulse, with an average power of 180 mW and pulse duration of 70 fs, is used to generate a supercontinuum of 140 mW. SC generation via propagation in HNLF is optimized for <b>specific</b> <b>polling</b> period and heating temperature of PPLN crystal for SHG around 1030 nm. At last, we will also discuss the attempt of second harmonic generation (SHG) by quasi phase matching in the periodically polled lithium niobate (PPLN) crystal due to nonlinear effect corresponding to different polling period and heating temperature...|$|E

50|$|Polled Holsteins {{were not}} fully {{recognized}} in the 1800s and were often placed in different categories then horned Holsteins. When record keeping began, polled Holsteins became more aware of and {{the understanding of the}} polled trait grew. The first polled Holstein sires used for artificial insemination (AI) started in the early to mid 1900s. After polledness was understood, farmers bred to these polled sires. Burket Falls Holsteins bred and got Burket Falls Elevation Sophia, a polled black & white Holstein. This particular cow has more than eight generations of polled progeny that has been spread through numerous farms. She herself had two daughters, Magnetic Susette, and Ca-lil Silver-ET and a bull Dispacher-ET. Both daughters produced calves and the son sired 400 calves. Having this <b>specific</b> <b>polled</b> Holstein with a large number of progeny greatly increased the amount of polled Holsteins present in the dairy industry and AI industry today. 38 polled bulls born between 1995 and 2004 were found in the artificial insemination breeding database in 2009.

40|$|Abstract. For a broad {{class of}} polling models the {{evolution}} of the system at <b>specific</b> embedded <b>polling</b> instants is known to constitute multitype branching process (MTBP) with immigration. In this paper it is shown that for this class of polling models the vector X that describes the state of the system at these polling instants satisfies the following heavy-traffic behavior, under mild assumptions: (1 − ρ) X →d γ Γ(α, μ) (ρ ↑ 1), (1) where γ is a known vector, Γ(α, μ) has a gamma-distribution with known parameters α and μ,andwhereρ is the load of the system. This general and powerful result is shown to lead to exact- and in many cases even closed-form- expressions for the Laplace-Stieltjes Transform (LST) of the complete asymptotic queue-length and waiting-time distributions for a broad class of branching-type polling models that includes many wellstudied polling models policies as special cases. The results generalize and unify many known results on the waiting times in polling systems in heavy traffic, and moreover, lead to new exact results for classical polling models that have not been observed before. As an illustration of the usefulness of the results, we derive new closed-form expressions for the LST of the waiting-time distributions for models with a cyclic globally-gated polling regime. As a by-product, our results lead to a number of asymptotic insensitivity properties, providing new fundamental insights in the behavior of polling models...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the results of a}} {{comprehensive}} survey concerning environmental awareness and vulnerability, conducted in October 2013 in the Yellow River Delta, China. The purpose of this survey is to provide insight to the vulnerability of rural households and their livelihoods to internal and external threats, such as flooding, oil spills, droughts, erosion, and salinization. Education level, awareness, opinions regarding pollution and available public utilities and facilities are also <b>polled.</b> <b>Specific</b> questions regarding agriculture and aquaculture activities are included. It is the most comprehensive questionnaire regarding social vulnerability in the area to date, with 93 households interviewed with the aid of an interpreter. The results show that the respondents generally have a low education; many earn below minimum wage for the area, and are not aware of global processes of climate variability and sea level rise. Cotton and maize are the predominant agriculture crops farmed in the area, while ground salinization is a major threat to agriculture. The results of this survey {{can be used in a}} follow up study in conjunction with a separate spatial data analysis (e. g. earth observation, census) to assess the social vulnerability in the Yellow River Delta in a spatially representative fashion.

40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} opinion polls before elections, their {{accuracy}} and their limitations. Even though these polls get great attention at public space, their limitations are not emphasized enough {{because of their}} issues. In my paper, I deal with the theory and clarify {{the way in which}} the polls are created at first. To present some context, a history of opinion polls is introduced in short in the text as well as their role in the political space. I also focus on the limitations of opinion polls and on the reasons which influence their accuracy. Furthermore, the text presents various methods which are used in pre-election surveys. It also describes the difference between <b>specific</b> types of <b>poll</b> results. The issue of potential influence of these polls on the decisions of voters is also discussed. In the next part of the thesis, I verify the accuracy of the opinion polls by comparing them to election results from the elections to the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic in 2010 and 2013. Three Czech agencies were involved in this study: CVVM, Median and STEM. Information about when the Czech voters decide if they will vote and which party they will choose plays significant importance in this thesis with regard to its conclusion.

40|$|Most jurisdictions {{maintain}} a registry {{of persons who}} are eligible to vote. To be eligible to vote, a person must be a U. S. citizen, meet a residency requirement, and have attained the age of 18 by Election Day. Persons who have been legally declared insane or mentally incompetent or who {{have been convicted of}} a felony and have not had their civil rights legally restored generally cannot vote, depending on state law. Prior to HAVA (Help America Vote Act of 2002), voter registration rolls were administered by local election officials. HAVA required states to administer voter registration, although not all states have completed the transition to a statewide voter registration system. Only 17 states had a fully functional statewide voter registration system in place for the 2004 election. To register to vote, a person must submit an application to the election authority of the local jurisdiction in which he or she resides. HAVA also requires that first-time registrants provide some form of identification. After the application has been processed, a voter registration, or confirmation, card is usually mailed to the registrant. The card assigns the registrant to a <b>specific</b> precinct and <b>polling</b> place. The registration remains “active ” as long as the registrant lives at his or her original residence address.
