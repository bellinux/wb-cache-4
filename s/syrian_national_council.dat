The <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> was recognized or supported in some capacity by at least 17 member states of the United Nations, with three of those (France, United Kingdom and the United States) being {{permanent members of the}} Security Council.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> (al-Majlis al-Waṭanī as-Sūri) {{sometimes}} {{known as}} SNC, the Syrian National Transitional Council or the National Council of Syria, is a Syrian opposition coalition, based in Istanbul (Turkey), formed in August 2011 during the Syrian civil uprising {{against the government}} of Bashar al-Assad.|$|E
25|$|After the Antalya conference, a {{follow-up}} meeting took place {{two days later}} in Brussels, then another gathering in Paris that was addressed by Bernard Henri Levy. It took a number of further meetings in Istanbul and Doha before yet another meeting on 23 August 2011 in Istanbul set up a permanent transitional council in form of the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> Democratic <b>Council</b> (SNDC) is a Syrian {{political}} opposition council created in November 2011 {{to oppose the}} current Syrian government. The council consists of Syrian opposition figures in exile.|$|R
25|$|Initially, {{the council}} denied seeking {{to play the}} role of a {{government}} in exile, but this changed a few months later when violence in Syria intensified. The <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> seeks the end of Bashar al-Assad's rule and the establishment of a modern, civil, democratic state. The SNC National Charter lists human rights, judicial independence, press freedom, democracy and political pluralism as its guiding principles.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} ten countries did {{not allow}} expatriate voting {{to be held in}} the Syrian diplomatic missions. In order to allow voters to participate in the elections following the ban, the Syrian government encouraged Syrian expatriates to fly back to their home country and cast their votes. Those foreign governments' decisions were welcomed by the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council,</b> a Syrian opposition organization and an opponent of Bashar al-Assad.|$|E
25|$|During {{the ongoing}} revolution, the Syrian opposition, {{represented}} by the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council,</b> then by the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces (commonly named the Syrian National Coalition) used {{a modified version of}} the independence flag first used in 1932 with a 2:3 aspect ratio. The modified independence flag began to be used as a universal display of the protesting opposition in late 2011. The opposition wanted to distinguish themselves from the current Syrian government and favoured the use of the flag used when Syria gained its independence from France. Khaled Kamal, an official from the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council,</b> now believes this flag to also represent independence and the end of Bashar al-Assad's government. Today the flag is mainly used in areas controlled by the Syrian National Coalition. The use of the modified independence flag is similar to the Libyan rebels' use of the pre-Gaddafi Libyan flag from the era of the Kingdom of Libya in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi's green flag. The original 1:2 aspect ratio flag has been used by the opposition unofficially on several occasions.|$|E
5000|$|On January 30, 2012, the Russian foreign {{ministry}} suggested [...] "informal" [...] talks in Moscow between the Syrian government and opposition, {{and said the}} Syrian authorities had already agreed to the Russian offer. Abdel Baset Seda, {{a member of the}} <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council’s</b> executive committee, told Reuters that the SNC had not received any formal invitation for such talks, but would decline if one arrived: [...] "Our position has not changed and it {{is that there is no}} dialogue with (President Bashar al-Assad)".|$|R
50|$|On 15 August 2012, {{members of}} the Syriac {{nationalist}} Syriac Union Party stormed the Syrian embassy in Stockholm in protest of the Syrian government. A dozen of its members were later detained by Swedish police.By October 2012, the <b>Syrian</b> Syriac <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> had been formed. In January 2013, a military wing, the Syrian Syriac Military council, was formed, based in Al-Hasakah Governorate, home to a large Assyrian Christian population.|$|R
50|$|Burhan Ghalioun (Arabic: برهان غليون) (born 11 February 1945 in Homs, Syria), is a French Syrian {{professor}} of sociology at the Université de Paris III Sorbonne University in Paris, and the first chairman of the <b>Syrian</b> opposition Transitional <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> (SNC). He was named chairman on 29 August 2011. His chairmanship was criticized for his perceived closeness to the Muslim Brotherhood, his early reluctance to arm opposition forces, and what opponents called the autocratic nature of his leadership. On 17 May 2012, feeling he had become an increasingly divisive figure for the council, Ghalioun resigned.|$|R
25|$|In July 2011, {{some of the}} anti-Assad groups met in Istanbul {{with a view to}} {{bringing}} the various internal and external opposition groups together. They agreed to form the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council.</b> Rebel fighters were joined by army defectors on the Turkish-Syrian border and declared the formation of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). They began forming fighting units to escalate the insurgency from September 2011. From the outset, the FSA was a disparate collection of loosely organized and largely independent units.|$|E
25|$|The Syrian Democratic Council was {{established}} on 10 December 2015 in al-Malikiyah. It was co-founded by prominent {{human rights activist}} Haytham Manna and was intended as the political wing of the Syrian Democratic Forces. The council includes {{more than a dozen}} blocs and coalitions that support federalism in Syria, including the Movement for a Democratic Society, the Kurdish National Alliance in Syria, the Law–Citizenship–Rights Movement, and since September 2016 the Syria's Tomorrow Movement. The last group is led by former National Coalition president and <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> Ahmad Jarba. In August 2016 the SDC opened a public office in al-Hasakah.|$|E
25|$|The National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces is a {{coalition}} of opposition groups and individuals, mostly exilic, who support the Syrian revolution side and are against the Assad government ruling Syria. It formed on 11 November 2012 at a conference of opposition groups and individuals held in Doha, Qatar. It has relations with other opposition {{organizations such as the}} <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council,</b> the previous iteration of an exilic political body attempting to represent the grassroots movement; the union of the two was planned, but has failed to realize. Moderate Islamic preacher Moaz al-Khatib, who had protested on the Syrian street in the early nonviolent phase of the uprising, served a term {{as the president of the}} coalition, but soon resigned his post, frustrated with the gap between the body and the grassroots of the uprising inside Syria. Riad Seif and Suheir Atassi, both of whom had also protested on the street in Syria early in the uprising, were elected as vice presidents. Mustafa Sabbagh is the coalition's secretary-general.|$|E
50|$|Formed on 23 August 2011, the <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> is a {{coalition}} of anti-government groups, based in Turkey. The <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> seeks the end of Bashar al-Assad's rule {{and the establishment of}} a modern, civil, democratic state. SNC has links with the Free Syrian Army. In November 2012, the council agreed to unify with several other opposition groups to form the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> Coalition. The SNC has 22 out of 60 seats of the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> Coalition.|$|R
5000|$|On 21 November 2012, the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), which {{controls}} {{territory in the}} north of Syria, rejected the new coalition and criticised it for [...] "obedience to Turkey and Qatar". The Kurdish <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> agreed to join the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> Coalition; the PYD criticized the KNC for doing so.|$|R
50|$|In November 2012, {{the council}} agreed to unify {{with several other}} {{opposition}} {{groups such as the}} NCCDC and the Damascus Declaration to form the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> Coalition.

2500|$|Unlike the MB-led {{insurgency}} of 1976-1982, {{the civil}} uprising {{phase of the}} Syrian Civil War which started in March 2011 began as a secular and nonviolent youth-led movement. Protesters, mostly formerly apolitical Syrians in their twenties and thirties, came together on a local, grassroots basis and had affiliations to older political ideologies, calling instead {{for the release of}} prisoners of conscience, guarantees of democratic freedoms, and the fall of the Assad government. In August, 2011, expatriated Syrian oppositionists formed the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> to seek international support for the uprising. The Syrian Muslim Brotherhood officially held five seats in the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council,</b> the main opposition umbrella outside Syria, but created a network of alliances with other SNC members, and created a controlling influence on the Council's relief committee. Since the formation of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces in November, 2012, the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> has taken a backseat to the Coalition, which is recognized as the external political body of oppositionists [...] "leading" [...] the revolution.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 October 2011 Libya's interim government, {{following}} the Libyan Civil War, the National Transitional Council {{became the first}} government to express [...] "its full recognition of the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> as the legitimate ruler of Syria" ...|$|E
50|$|On July 25, 1936, Maronite priest Louis Khalil {{published}} a book in which he stated numerous accusations against the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> Party and its leader. He did so {{with the approval of}} the Maronite Patriarch ‘Arida. The booklet was entitled Al-Hizb al-Suri al-Qawmi Mu’amarah ‘ala al-Din wa al-Watan (Arabic: الحزب السوري القومي مؤامرة على الدين والوطن) which means The <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> Party: a Conspiracy Against Religion and Country. In the book, the Rev. Khalil mentioned, “This is the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> Party, a secret sect endeavoring to dissolve the Holy Church and every religion as well as ethics and Lebanon.” He also argued that the principles of the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> Party are against the Lebanese homeland and religion, especially Christianity.|$|R
2500|$|The {{capture of}} al-Yaarubiyah {{was hailed as}} great success by the PYD, but was also welcomed by the Kurdish <b>National</b> <b>Council,</b> a local {{political}} opponent of the PYD. Similarly, Syrian pro-government media reported {{the defeat of the}} Islamist rebel forces at al-Yaarubiyah with satisfaction. The <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> Coalition, however, another Syrian opposition group and rival of the PYD, condemned the YPG for expelling the [...] "Free Syrian Army" [...] from the town, even though no FSA forces had been present during the battle. In contrast, the Ahrar al-Jazeera Brigade took an intermediate stance, and officially denounced the purported Iraqi invasion of al-Yaarubiyah, {{while at the same time}} trying to negotiate a power-sharing deal with the YPG.|$|R

2500|$|A broader {{opposition}} umbrella group, the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, {{was formed}} in November 2012 and has gained recognition as the [...] "legitimate representative of the Syrian people" [...] by the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (CCASG) and as a [...] "representative of aspirations of Syrian people" [...] by the Arab League. The Syrian National Coalition was subsequently given the seat of Syria in the Arab League, with The Syrian Government representative suspended. The <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council,</b> initially {{a part of the}} Syrian National Coalition, withdrew on 20 January 2014 in protest at the decision of the coalition to attend the Geneva talks. Despite tensions, the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> retains a degree of ties with the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces. Syrian opposition groups held reconciliation talks in Astana, Kazakhstan in October 2015.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 October 2011, the NTC {{became the}} first {{government}} {{in the world to}} recognize the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> (SNC) as Syria's [...] "legitimate authority." [...] In November, the Libyan authorities met secretly with members of the SNC and offered them money, arms and, potentially, volunteer fighters for the insurgency against the Syrian government. Abdelhakim Belhadj, head of the Tripoli Military Council, met with leaders of the Free Syrian Army to discuss sending Libyan fighters to train the army's troops. By December, thousands of refugees fleeing the escalating violence in Syria were seeking shelter in Libya.|$|E
2500|$|Relations {{with other}} Syrian {{political}} opposition groups are generally poor. The Syrian Revolution General Commission, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria or the Supreme Council of the Syrian Revolution oppose the NCC calls to {{dialogue with the}} Syrian government. In September 2012, the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> (SNC) reaffirmed that despite broadening its membership, it would not join with [...] "currents close to [...] NCC". Despite recognizing the Free Syrian Army on 23 September 2012, the FSA has dismissed the NCC {{as an extension of}} the government, stating that [...] "this opposition is just the other face of the same coin".|$|E

2500|$|According to Hassan Hassan {{writing in}} the Guardian {{newspaper}} in mid-2012, while the Brotherhood did come to dominate the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council,</b> a body formed outside Syria, the Brotherhood {{appears to be more}} popular among exiles than in the uprising population inside Syria. [...] "Activists from various parts of Syria have told me that, prior to the uprising last year, the country had almost zero Brotherhood presence." [...] "At least 70%" [...] of Syria's population – non-Sunnis (Muslim and Christian), Kurds, and tribal groups [...] "have been outside" [...] the Brotherhood's influence [...] "in the past", and Hassan believes will remain so in the future.|$|E
2500|$|The FSA {{called on}} their “Kurdish brothers” to join rebels {{fighting}} President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, while promising {{an end to}} injustices against Kurds in a future democratic Syria. The spokesperson for the joint command of the FSA said; [...] "“The Joint Command of the Free Syrian Army ... appeals to our Kurdish brothers, soldiers and civilians, and invites them to {{join the ranks of}} the FSA inside the country, let us work together to transform the FSA into an alternative national military institution to the army of the ruling gang.” The statement also emphazied that kurds are and have always been [...] "partners" [...] working “hand-in-hand to build the country’s future and end discrimination for all Syrians, whatever their ethnic or religious background.” The head of the <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>council</b> is a Kurdish activist.|$|E
2500|$|Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, {{head of the}} United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), {{confirmed}} opposition group {{claims that}} at least 90 civilians were killed, including 32 children in Houla, Homs province. General Mood declared the killings [...] "indiscriminate and unforgivable" [...] without explaining how they happened, but said the violence had begun Friday evening {{with the use of}} [...] "tanks, artillery, rocket-propelled grenades, and heavy machine guns", implying an attack by government forces since the FSA do not possess heavy weaponry. The official news agency of the Syrian government alleged that [...] "Al-Qaeda terrorist groups" [...] were responsible for the killings, while opposition groups alleged that the Syrian military and government-linked militias known as Shabiha were the perpetrators. The <b>Syrian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> (SNC), Syria's main opposition bloc, put the death toll at more than 110 people, half of them children. State media claimed 17 had been killed.
