Despite this, the DragonFly BSD and FreeBSD projects still work together contributing bug fixes, driver updates, and other system improvements to each other.|$|E
5|$|Phase {{truncation}} spurs can {{be reduced}} substantially {{by the introduction of}} white gaussian noise prior to truncation. The so-called dither noise is summed into the lower W+1 bits of the PA output word to linearize the truncation operation. Often the improvement can be achieved without penalty because the DAC noise floor tends to dominate <b>system</b> <b>performance.</b> Amplitude truncation spurs can not be mitigated in this fashion. Introduction of noise into the static values held in the PAC ROMs would not eliminate the cyclicality of the truncation error terms and thus would not achieve the desired effect.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method to describe, analyse and estimate production <b>system</b> <b>performances.</b> Work-in-process (units), lead time (number of time units {{spent in the}} production system for each unit) and throughput (number of produced units per time unit) are basic performance measures, also used in this article. It is essential for industry to know about relations between system parameters and <b>system</b> <b>performances</b> in existing <b>systems,</b> and in not yet implemented <b>system</b> alternatives. Different <b>performances</b> are achieved by adjusting system parameters. Trade-offs between system parameters and its different performances are necessary to stay efficient and competitive in today's market. Queuing theory and simulation can help the decision makers to estimate <b>system</b> <b>performances</b> of existing and not yet implemented systems. When the complexity increases queuing theory becomes cumbersome, very difficult and eventually impossible to use. A single simulation presents limited information. Multiple simulations are necessary {{to ensure that the}} best alternative is chosen. A high number of simulations demand a lot of computer time and resources. Reduction of runs is desirable even with cheaper computer equipment. Currently, traditional two-dimensional charts are the only tools to present and analyse <b>system</b> <b>performances.</b> This article {{presents a}} new surrogate model for easier estimation and presentation of <b>system</b> <b>performances,</b> their internal relations, and relations to the system parameters. With the new surrogate model, <b>system</b> <b>performances</b> based on simulations are presented as positions in a three-dimensional environment. Parametric curves and surfaces of Bezier type are generated and adapted to these positions. <b>System</b> <b>performances</b> of other <b>system</b> alternatives can then be estimated without explicit simulation. The number of simulation calculations can thereby be moderated. The method is illustrated with a small production line systemValiderad; 2010; 20100719 (andbra...|$|R

25|$|The control <b>system</b> <b>performance</b> can be {{improved}} by combining the feedback (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with feed-forward (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall <b>system</b> <b>performance.</b> The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or error remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open loop control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can {{be based on the}} setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{important}} bottlenecks to the wider adoption of planning support systems {{is a lack of}} evidence about whether they improve planning processes. In addition, existing research does not include field studies with high context validity. This paper fills this gap in the literature by reporting the results from a field study evaluating the performance of a planning support systems used for sketch planning as part of a land use planning project in metropolitan Austin, Texas, USA. Participants reported high levels of learning and dialog quality, the two chosen planning support <b>systems</b> <b>performance</b> measures. A regression analysis finds both are related to the ability of planning support systems to change participantsâ€™ perceptions. In addition, as suggested by learning theory, the planning support <b>systems</b> <b>performance</b> outcomes are significantly related to participantsâ€™ identity as a planner and meeting attendance, but are not related to gender or educational attainment. Finally, for the planning support systems studied here, participation in the planning support systems creation is less important than other factors in explaining planning support <b>systems</b> <b>performance.</b> The paper contributes to efforts to develop and implement robust measures of planning support <b>systems</b> <b>performance</b> and links concept of planning support <b>systems</b> <b>performance</b> to broader theories of learning.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{present a}} {{framework}} for measuring the quality of community systems for children, based on key attributes of <b>systems</b> <b>performance</b> for children's services. We present a research agenda for refining the model, evaluating indicators across the performance domains identified, developing normative standards for performance, and assessing the empirical basis for performance criteria. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: <b>Systems</b> <b>performance</b> can be measured. A systems approach to evaluating community systems for children needs to incorporate the multilevel service delivery networks, programs, and systems of care for children. A model of community <b>systems</b> <b>performance</b> for children includes key dimensions of structure, financing, and accountability. Attributes within these dimensions serve as indicators that communities can use to evaluate <b>systems</b> quality. <b>Performance</b> standards can {{be based on the}} evidence from field demonstrations as well as from normative assessments. RECOMMENDATIONS: The model of community <b>systems</b> <b>performance</b> should be refined and developed using empirical findings of analyses of children's systems. A set of indicators that capture vital aspects of performance and that are relevant, scientifically valid, and feasible should be developed and tested in field studies. Once indicators are evaluated for use in performance monitoring, communities will be able to implement performance monitoring...|$|R
