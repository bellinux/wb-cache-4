5|$|Under the Maryland Constitution of 1776, the Governor {{was chosen}} for one-year terms by both houses of the General Assembly. An 1838 {{constitutional}} amendment allowed voters to elect the Governor to three-year terms from one of three rotating gubernatorial districts: eastern, southern, and western. At each election, only voters from a single gubernatorial election district selected the Governor. The Maryland Constitution of 1851 lengthened the Governor's term of office from three to four years, which brought elections for Governor in line with elections for Federal offices that occur only in even years. Finally, the Constitution of 1864 eliminated the rotating gubernatorial election districts and, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> of 1868, the Governor has been elected by all the voters of the state.|$|E
