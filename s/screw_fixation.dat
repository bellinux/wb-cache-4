2500|$|The {{proximal}} tendons of the biceps brachii {{are commonly}} involved in pathological processes {{and are a}} frequent cause of anterior shoulder pain. Disorders of the distal biceps brachii tendon typically result from partial and complete tears of the muscle. [...] Partial tears are usually characterized by enlargement and abnormal contour of the tendon. Complete tears generate a soft-tissue mass in the anterior aspect of the arm, the so-called Popeye sign, which paradoxically leads to a decreased strength during flexion and supination of the forearm. Tears of the biceps brachii occur in athletic activities and corrective surgery repairs biceps brachii tendon tears. [...] Proximal ruptures of the long head of the biceps tendon can be surgically repaired by two different techniques. Biceps tenodesis is resurfacing the tendon by <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> on the humerus and biceps tenotomy is trimming the long head of the biceps tendon promoting the muscle origination from the coracoid process. Preexisting degeneration in the tendon can cause partial tears called lesions and are rarely associated with a traumatic event. The most common symptom of a biceps tear is pain. It {{will be the most}} severe in the muscle, but may stretch to the shoulders and elbows as well. [...] Treatment of a biceps tear depends on the severity of the injury. [...] In most cases, the muscle will heal over time with no corrective surgery. Applying cold pressure and using anti-inflammatory medications will ease pain and reduce swelling. More severe injuries require surgery and post-op physical therapy to regain strength and functionality in the muscle. Corrective surgeries of this nature are typically reserved for elite athletes who rely on a complete recovery.|$|E

40|$|Session: Trauma: {{acetabular}} and proximal femoral fractureOral PresentationINTRODUCTION: Os calcis fractures {{are among}} {{one of the}} most difficult fractures to treat. Many of these fractures are the result of high energy trauma in heavy manual workers. Many of them could not go back to their original work because of various degrees of pain and stiffness. METHODS: From January 2007 till December 2007, Sanders II os calcis fractures were selected for operation with percutaneous <b>screws</b> <b>fixation.</b> After the operation, the patients were allowed to have free ankle mobilization exercise. 6 - 12 weeks of protected weight bearing walking was allowed followed by full weight bearing walking. Their x-rays, ankle range of movement and walking ability were assessed in regular interval. RESULTS: We have operated 14 os calcis fractures using percutaneous <b>screws</b> <b>fixation</b> in 12 patients. Their age ranged from 17 to 86. 8 were male and the other 4 were female. 4 patients had bilateral os calcis fractures. All fractures healed radiologically within 3 months. Some minor loss of initial reduction was seen. There were no major fractures. All fractures healed radiologically within 3 months. Some minor loss of initial reduction was seen.

To achieve this operative or non-operative treatment plans are considered by physicians based on criteria such as patient characteristics, severity, risk of complications, fracture depression and displacement, degree of injury to ligaments and menisci, vascular and neurological compromise.For early management, traction should be performed early in ward. It can either be Skin Traction or Skeletal Traction. Depends on the body weight of patient and stability of the joint.

50|$|Dynamic hip screw (DHS) or Sliding <b>Screw</b> <b>Fixation</b> {{is a type}} of {{orthopaedic}} implant designed for fixation of certain types of hip fractures which allows controlled dynamic sliding of the femoral head component along the construct. One common use is internal fixation of intertrochanteric fractures of the femur, which are common in older osteoporotic patients. There are 3 components of a dynamic hip screw, including a lag screw (inserted into the neck of the femur), a sideplate and four cortical screws (fixated into the proximal femoral shaft). The idea behind the dynamic compression is that the femoral head component is allowed to move along one plane; since bone responds to dynamic stresses, the native femur may undergo primary healing: cells join along boundaries, resulting in a robust joint requiring no remodeling.|$|E
5000|$|Minimally {{invasive}} {{procedures are}} a more common alternative {{due to the}} decreased risk of damaging significant muscle tissue. The difference between invasive and minimally invasive spinal surgeries is that minimally invasive procedures involves {{a series of small}} incisions. Minimally invasive procedures can be performed anywhere along the spine, and have been used to treat various abnormalities. The percutaneous pedicle <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> technique allows for a procedure that presents minimal risk to the patient. Fluoroscopic image guided navigation through these portals allows for surgeons to perform more efficient procedures. Minimally invasive procedures often yield a much faster recovery time than fully invasive surgeries, making them more appealing to patients. Laminectomies have always been the gold standard when treating lumbar spinal stenosis, but recently, less invasive surgeries have emerged as a safer alternative treatment that helps maintain the postoperative structural integrity of the spine.|$|E

50|$|Non {{displaced}} or minimally displaced {{waist and}} distal fractures {{have a high}} rate of union with closed cast management. The choice of short arm, short arm thumb spica or long arm cast is debated in the medical literature and no clear consensus or proof of the benefit of one type of casting or another has been shown; although it is generally accepted to use a short arm or short arm thumb spica for non displaced fractures. Non displaced or minimally displaced fracture can also be treated with percutaneous or minimal incision surgery which if performed correctly has a high union rate, low morbidity and faster return to activity than closed cast management. Percutaneous <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> is recommended over a wide surgical approach as this method preserves the palmar ligament complex and local vasculature, and helps avoid postoperative complications. This surgery includes screwing the scaphoid bone back together at the most perpendicular angle possible to promote quicker and stronger healing of the bone. During this procedure, slight excavation of the edge of the trapezium bone may be necessary to reach the scaphoid as 80% of this bone is covered with articular cartilage, which makes it difficult {{to gain access to the}} scaphoid.|$|E
50|$|A {{legitimate}} {{concern in}} any fracture {{is whether the}} fracture will heal quickly and without complication. Failure of the fractured ends to unite is called non-union and its frequency varies with the fracture site, some fracture sites being notorious for non-union. An example of such would be a scaphoid (navicular) fracture of the wrist. Such a complication also involves fractures of the proximal end of the fifth metatarsal, such as the Jones fracture. This {{has been the subject}} of interest, and initially led to the description of three zones at the proximal end of the fifth metatarsal. Zones I and III have been associated with relatively guaranteed union and this union has taken place with only limited restriction of activity combined with early immobilization. On the other hand, zone II has been associated with either delayed or non-union and, consequently, it has been generally agreed that fractures in this area should be considered for some form of internal immobilization, such as internal <b>screw</b> <b>fixation.</b> These zones can be identified anatomically and on x-ray adding to the clinical usefulness of this classification.It should be emphasized that surgical intervention is not, by itself, a guarantee of cure and has its own complication rate. Other reviews of the literature have concluded that conservative, non-operative, treatment is an acceptable option for the non-athlete.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{subsidence}} displacement after cyclic loading among 4 sacral pedicle <b>screw</b> <b>fixations</b> of bicortical, tricortical, standard polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) augmentation, and sub-endplate PMMA augmentation in osteoporotic condition. Summary of background data: Implant failure caused by screw loosening is a clinical problem for lumbosacral fusions, especially in osteoporotic patients. To improve sacral screw anchoring strength, the main fixation techniques {{need to be}} evaluated biomechanically. Methods: For this study, 11 fresh osteoporotic cadaver sacra were harvested and bone mineral density was measured with dual-energy radiograph absorptiometry. A 7 mm diameter monoaxial pedicle screw (S 1) was randomly assigned by side (left vs. right) and placed bicortically or tricortically. The 2 screws, followed 2000 cyclic compression loading of 30 to 250 N, were removed. The screw tracts were filled up with PMMA, then, screws 5 mm shorter than the bicortical or tricortical fixation were reinserted (defined as standard and sub-endplate PMMA augmented sacral <b>screw</b> <b>fixations,</b> respectively). The PMMA augmented screws were then retested as before. Screw subsidence displacement after 2000 cyclic loading was measured and compared. Results: The average bone mineral density of 11 specimens was 0. 71 g/cm, ranged from 0. 65 to 0. 78 g/cm. No significant difference of subsidence displacement was detected between tricortical and standard PMMA augmented screws (P> 0. 05), however, the 2 fixations exhibited markedly less subsidence than bicortical screw (P< 0. 05). Sub-endplate PMMA augmented screw showed the least subsidence among all the screws (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: PMMA augmentation can increase the bonding strength of sacral screw-bone interface and the sub-endplate PMMA augmented sacral screw could obtain the highest stability among the 4 fixation techniques in osteoporotic condition. © 2010 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{compare the}} {{stability}} of lengthened sacroiliac screw and standard sacroiliac screw {{for the treatment of}} unilateral vertical sacral fractures; to provide reference for clinical applications. MethodsA finite element model of Tile type C pelvic ring injury (unilateral Denis type II fracture of the sacrum) was produced. The unilateral sacral fractures were fixed with lengthened sacroiliac screw and sacroiliac screw in six different types of models respectively. The translation and angle displacement of the superior surface of the sacrum (in standing position on both feet) were measured and compared. ResultsThe stability of one lengthened sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in S 1 or S 2 segment is superior to that of one sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in the same sacral segment. The stability of one lengthened sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in S 1 and S 2 segments respectively is superior to that of one sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in S 1 and S 2 segments respectively. The stability of one lengthened sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in S 1 and S 2 segments respectively is superior to that of one lengthened sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in S 1 or S 2 segment. The stability of one sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in S 1 and S 2 segments respectively is markedly superior to that of one sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in S 1 or S 2 segment. The vertical and rotational stability of lengthened sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> and sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in S 2 is superior to that of S 1. ConclusionIn a finite element model of type C pelvic ring disruption, S 1 and S 2 lengthened sacroiliac screws should be utilized for the fixation as regularly as possible and the most stable fixation is the combination of the lengthened sacroiliac screws of S 1 and S 2 segments. Even if lengthened sacroiliac screws cannot be systematically used due to specific conditions, one sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in S 1 and S 2 segments respectively is recommended.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: No {{studies have}} {{compared}} monoaxial and polyaxial pedicle screws {{with regard to}} the von Mises stress of the instrumentation, intradiscal pressures of the adjacent segment and adjacent segment degeneration. METHODS: Short-segment monoaxial/polyaxial pedicle <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> techniques were compared using finite element methods, and the redistributed T 11 -L 1 segment range of motion, largest maximal von Mises stress of the instrumentation, and intradiscal pressures of the adjacent segment under displacement loading were evaluated. Radiographic results of 230 patients with traumatic thoracolumbar fractures treated with these fixations were reviewed, and the sagittal Cobb&# 39;s angle, vertebral body angle, anterior vertebral body height of the fractured vertebrae and adjacent segment degeneration were calculated and evaluated. RESULTS: The largest maximal values of the von Mises stress were 376. 8 MPa for the pedicle screws in the short-segment monoaxial pedicle <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> model and 439. 9 MPa for the rods in the intermediate monoaxial pedicle <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> model. The maximal intradiscal pressures of the upper adjacent segments were all greater than those of the lower adjacent segments. The maximal intradiscal pressures of the monoaxial pedicle <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> model were larger than those in the corresponding segments of the normal model. The radiographic results at the final follow-up evaluation showed that the mean loss of correction of the sagittal Cobb&# 39;s angle, vertebral body angle and anterior vertebral body height were smallest in the intermediate monoaxial pedicle <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> group. Adjacent segment degeneration was less likely to be observed in the intermediate polyaxial pedicle <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> group but more likely to be observed in the intermediate monoaxial pedicle <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> group.
