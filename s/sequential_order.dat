5|$|The idea {{to develop}} a remake came when Oyamada, due to the Mana series' 25th anniversary in 2016, thought about how he would like players {{to be able to}} play through the series in <b>sequential</b> <b>order</b> on modern game {{platforms}}. The platforms – Android, iOS and PlayStation Vita – were decided on from the beginning. Initially, there were some arguments at Square Enix about whether to create the game using 2D or 3D graphics; they settled on 3D, as Oyamada thought that 3D games are easier to control on smartphones. Additionally, the development team thought that a 3D version would be better, as it could be used as a base for potential remakes of other Mana games; depending on the reception of Adventures of Mana, Oyamada said that he would like {{to develop a}} remake of Seiken Densetsu 3, and would consider one of Secret of Mana depending on demand.|$|E

40|$|The <b>sequential</b> <b>ordering</b> {{problem is}} a graph problem with several {{applications}} in dierent Operations Research topics. One of them is scheduling problems. In this topic we can identify a solution of the <b>sequential</b> <b>ordering</b> problem with a solution sequence of a certain single machine scheduling problem associated. This paper uses these scheduling applications to study the <b>sequential</b> <b>ordering</b> problem from a stochastic approach, considering two hierarchical performance criteria. Note that in deterministic sequencing problems, given a solution, {{it is easy to}} check if it is feasible and to calculate its makespan. However, {{this is not the case}} in stochastic problems. Thus, the two criteria considered to formulate the Hierarchical Stochastic <b>Sequential</b> <b>Ordering</b> Problem (HSSOP) are: to maximize feasibility probability and to minimize expected makespan. The paper shows that this problem has maximun computational complexity. We develop these ideas and we study several alternatives to measure feasibility probability and expected makespan. We also compute bounds and values to estimate these quantities. Finally, we develop an approach to solve the problem and report a computational experience...|$|R

25|$|The {{chronology}} of this era is particularly uncertain due to difficulties {{in our understanding}} of the text, our understanding of the material culture of the Early Dynastic period and a general lack of radiocarbon dates for sites in Iraq. Also, the multitude of city-states made for a confusing situation, as each had its own history. The Sumerian king list is one record of the political history of the period. It starts with mythological figures with improbably long reigns, but later rulers have been authenticated with archaeological evidence. The first of these is Enmebaragesi of Kish, c. 2600 BC, said by the king list to have subjected neighboring Elam. However, one complication of the Sumerian king list is that although dynasties are listed in <b>sequential</b> <b>order,</b> some of them actually ruled at the same time over different areas.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Industrial Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. This {{project was}} {{initiated}} {{to develop a}} new and novel approach to address complex sequencing problems, in particular, an alternative method was developed to find solutions to the <b>sequential</b> <b>ordering</b> problem. The <b>sequential</b> <b>ordering</b> problem is concerned with the arrangement of a number of elements in a sequence that respects a number of precedence constraints and results in the lowest overall cost. A precedence constraint requires that some element will occur before another in the solution sequence, and the cost of a solution is determined by summing the independent individual costs that are incurred when progressing from one specific element in the solution sequence to another. Instances of this problem are regularly found in the practice of industrial engineering in problems such as the routing of a delivery vehicle, the scheduling of jobs on a machine and the preparation of project plans with limited resources. The <b>sequential</b> <b>ordering</b> problem is known to be complex in the sense that as the size of problem instances increases, the best-known time required to find a guaranteed optimal solution increases exponentially...|$|R
25|$|By contrast, Genie {{performed}} significantly {{below average}} and showed much slower progress on all tests measuring predominantly left-hemisphere tasks. Stephen Krashen wrote that by 2 {{years after the}} first examinations on her mental age Genie's scores on left-hemisphere tasks consistently fell into the 2- to 3-year-old range, only showing an improvement of 1 years. On <b>sequential</b> <b>order</b> tests she consistently scored well below average for someone with a fully intact brain, although she did somewhat better on visual than on auditory tests. The scientists especially noted that she did not start to count until late 1972, and then only in an extremely deliberate and laborious manner. In January 1972 the scientists measured her in the 50th percentile for an 8- to 9-year-old on Raven's Progressive Matrices, although they noted she was outside of the age range of the test's design. Similarly, when the scientists administered Knox Cubes tests in 1973 and 1975 Genie's score improved from the level of a 6-year-old to a 7-year-old, more rapid than her progress with language but significantly slower than that of right hemisphere tasks.|$|E
25|$|By November 1972 Genie {{could use}} the word on, {{although}} it was uncertain whether she distinguished between on and in and Curtiss wrote that all of Genie's earliest utterances containing on and in were answers to somebody asking her a question, and could correctly use the suffix -ing to describe events in the present progressive. These were the first grammatical markers in her speech, and both are normally two of the first grammatical markers young children can use. Her use of -ing on exclusively dynamic verbs also indicated to linguists that she categorized dynamic versus stative verbs, although she did not use it with the verb to be until the fall of 1973 and then only when speaking in first or third-person. Even after learning the present progressive she inconsistently gave correct responses to it on tests, {{and use of the}} suffix -ing was the only way Genie modified a sentence without changing any of the base words. Although Genie had gained some understanding of number words during her initial stay at Children's Hospital she only began to count in <b>sequential</b> <b>order</b> in late 1972, always in very deliberate and laborious manner, and her progress was extremely slow.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{application}} of multigrid methods to the equations of elasticity has been suggested, few such applications {{have been reported in}} the literature. In the present work, multigrid techniques are applied to the finite element analysis of a simply supported Bernoulli-Euler beam, and various aspects of the multigrid algorithm are studied and explained in detail. In this study, six grid levels were used to model half the beam. With linear prolongation and <b>sequential</b> <b>ordering,</b> the multigrid algorithm yielded results which were of machine accuracy with work equivalent to 200 standard Gauss-Seidel iterations on the fine grid. Also with linear prolongation and <b>sequential</b> <b>ordering,</b> the V(1,n) cycle with n greater than 2 yielded better convergence rates than the V(n, 1) cycle. The restriction and prolongation operators were derived based on energy principles. Conserving energy during the inter-grid transfers required that the prolongation operator be the transpose of the restriction operator, and led to improved convergence rates. With energy-conserving prolongation and <b>sequential</b> <b>ordering,</b> the multigrid algorithm yielded results of machine accuracy with a work equivalent to 45 Gauss-Seidel iterations on the fine grid. The red-black ordering of relaxations yielded solutions of machine accuracy in a single V(1, 1) cycle, which required work equivalent to about 4 iterations on the finest grid level...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{show how}} {{ordering}} {{time can be}} used as a mechanism to mitigate the supply risks of the unreliable newsboy.

The effectiveness of our approach is assessed by comparing its expected cost with the expected cost of the conventional reliable newsboy problem. It is demonstrated that the adverse effect of supply side risks can be almost completely negated by adopting our approach when the combined purchasing and holding costs for a low cost supplier at an earlier stage are equal to those of a high cost supplier at the next stage.

500|$|Feedforward processing: The {{cerebellum}} {{differs from}} most {{other parts of}} the brain (especially the cerebral cortex) in that the signal processing is almost entirely feedforward—that is, signals move unidirectionally through the system from input to output, with very little recurrent internal transmission. The small amount of recurrence that does exist consists of mutual inhibition; there are no mutually excitatory circuits. This feedforward mode of operation means that the cerebellum, in contrast to the cerebral cortex, cannot generate self-sustaining patterns of neural activity. Signals enter the circuit, are processed by each stage in <b>sequential</b> <b>order,</b> and then leave. As Eccles, Ito, and Szentágothai wrote, [...] "This elimination in the design of all possibility of reverberatory chains of neuronal excitation is undoubtedly a great advantage in the performance of the cerebellum as a computer, because {{what the rest of the}} nervous system requires from the cerebellum is presumably not some output expressing the operation of complex reverberatory circuits in the cerebellum but rather a quick and clear response to the input of any particular set of information." ...|$|E
