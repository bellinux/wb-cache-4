40|$|Bombyx mori silk fibroin is a {{fibrous protein}} whose fiber is {{extremely}} strong and tough, {{although it is}} produced by the silkworm at room temperature and from an aqueous solution. The primary structure is mainly Ala-Gly alternative copolypeptide, but Gly-Ala-Ala-Ser units appear frequently and periodically. Thus, this study aims at elucidating the role of such Gly-Ala-Ala-Ser units on the secondary structure. The sequential model peptides containing Gly-Ala-Ala-Ser units selected from the primary structure of B. mori silk fibroin were synthesized, and their secondary structure was studied with 13 C CP/MAS NMR and wide-angle X-ray scattering. The 13 C isotope labeling of the peptides and the 13 C conformation-dependent chemical shifts {{were used for the}} purpose. The Ala-Ala units take antiparallel β-sheet structure locally, and the introduction of one Ala-Ala unit in (Ala-Gly) 15 chain promotes dramatical <b>structural</b> changes from <b>silk</b> I (repeated β-turn type II structure) to silk II (antiparallel β-sheet structure). Thus, the presence of Ala-Ala units in B. mori silk fibroin chain {{will be one of the}} inducing factors of the <b>structural</b> transition for <b>silk</b> fiber formation. The role of Tyr residue in the peptide chain was also studied and clarified to induce "locally nonordered structure. ...|$|R

40|$|Embioptera is {{a little}} studied order of widely distributed, but rarely seen, insects. Members of this group, also called embiids or webspinners, all heavily rely on silken tunnels {{in which they live}} and reproduce. However, embiids vary in their {{substrate}} preferences and these differences may result in divergent silk mechanical properties. Here, we present diameter measurements, tensile tests, and protein secondary <b>structural</b> analyses of <b>silks</b> spun by several embiid species. Despite their diverse habitats and phylogenetic relationships, these species have remarkably similar silk diameters and ultimate stress values. Yet, ultimate strain, Young’s modulus, and toughness vary considerably. To better understand these tensile properties, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy was used to quantify secondary structural components. Compared to other arthropod silks, embiid silks are shown to have consistent secondary structures, suggesting that commonality of amino acid sequence motifs and small differences in structural composition can lead to significant changes in tensile properties...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigated}} whether elevated host immune capacity can inhibit T. gondii infection. For this purpose, we used silk protein extracted from Bombyx mori cocoons {{as a natural}} supplement to augment immune capacity. After silk protein administration to BALB/c mice for 6 weeks, ratios of T lymphocytes (CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cells) and splenocyte proliferative capacities in response to Con A or T. gondii lysate antigen (TLA) were increased. Of various cytokines, which regulate immune systems, Th 1 cytokines, such as IFN-γ, IL- 2, and IL- 12, were obviously increased in splenocyte primary cell cultures. Furthermore, the survival of T. gondii (RH strain) -infected mice increased from 2 days to 5 or more days. In a state of immunosuppression induced by methylprednisolone acetate, silk protein-administered mice were resistant to reduction in T-lymphocyte (CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cells) numbers and the splenocyte proliferative capacity induced by Con A or TLA with a statistical significance. Taken together, our results suggest that silk protein augments immune capacity in mice and the increased cellular immunity by silk protein administration increases host protection against acute T. gondii infection.

The first chapter gives an overview of the work done so far in the preparation of peptide-polymer hybrid materials. In the second, third and fourth chapter, the controlled radical polymerisation, using ATRP, of peptide sequences based on the <b>structural</b> proteins <b>silk</b> and elastin was investigated. It was found that by including peptides sequences from these two structural proteins into the side chain of a synthetic polymer, the secondary structure associated with these peptide sequences was also introduced. In the case of the elastin based polymer a variety of interesting properties were observed. In the fifth chapter a beta-hairpin forming peptide, again based on silk, was used to initiate the polymerisation of methyl methacrylate. This gave rise to a triblock copolymer with a hydrophilic peptide as a central block with two hydrophobic outer blocks. Upon examining this polymer with electron microscopy large spherical aggregates were observed. In the final chapter a two monomers based on the antimicrobial peptides, KFFKFFKFFK and gramicidin S, a large cyclic decapeptide were prepared and polymerised using ATRP.

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{overcome}} the shortcomings of the existing membranes by developing new barrier membrane from silk protein. Silk is a natural macromolecule originating from Bombyx mori that mainly consists of two proteins, fibroin and sericin [12 – 15]. Fibroin is the <b>structural</b> center of <b>silk,</b> with a specific fibroin layer giving the silk tensile strength. The high glycine and alanine content in silk fibroin leads to tightly packed beta membranes, resulting in rigidity and tensile strength [15]. Silk fibroin can increase alkaline phosphatase activity and type I collagen expression in MG 63 cells [16]. As both proteins are bone formation marker, silk fibroin has been widely used as a scaffold for bone graft [12]. The first silk barrier membrane was produced by electrospinning, which requires a large facility for mass production [17]. However, silk fibroin film was found to be fragile and dissolved easily in aqueous solution when it was used a barrier membrane [18].|$|R

Furthermore, an increase in thermal diffusivity and elastic modulus is observed with decreasing fiber diameter, trending toward properties of natural fiber.

Because of the rough morphology and the ultrafine size of the particles, degradation of silk particles by protease XIV was increased by about 3 -fold compared to silk fibers.

Rapid, on-site condition monitoring would offer significant benefits to conservators and museum curators concerned with continued access to collections. In this paper, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) is investigated as noninvasive approach to the characterization of silk fabrics and particularly for determining the moisture content of silks as potential age-related marker. Bands within the NIR spectrum of silk are assigned to contributions from water and the silk fibroin polymer. The water bands may be deconvolved to show separate contributions from bound and <b>structural</b> water. When <b>silk</b> is exposed to deuterium oxide, the water OH NIR bands are rapidly lost. The accompanying changes in the amide-related NIR absorptions reflect differential accessibility of regions within the semi-crystalline fibroin aggregate.

The recombinant proteins can be fabricated into a range of forms; however the resultant material is soluble in water and requires a post production stabilizing treatment. In this study, we describe the structural and mechanical properties of sponges fabricated from artificial honeybee silk proteins that have been stabilized in aqueous methanol baths or by dry heating. Aqueous methanol treatment induces formation of ß-sheets, {{with the amount of}} ß-sheet dictated by methanol concentration.

40|$|Silk is an {{important}} biomaterial for tissue engineering purposes due to its improved mechanical and biological properties. The natural fiber has two major components – the structural centre protein chain called fibroin and the outer glue like covering fiber called sericin. It {{has been well documented}} that sericin has the immunogenic properties in animal and human physiological system and so the silk is used only after the sericin is removed thus improving the mechanical and biological properties of silk. Removing sericin from silk is called degumming i. e. “removing the gum”. It should be done carefully {{in a way that the}} fibroin is not damaged. Sericin is removed by using a base such as anhydrous sodium carbonate as well as autoclaving by using water under pressure.

Spider webs themselves are characterized by a highly organized geometry that optimizes their function 7, 8, 18, 19, 20. To explore the contribution of the material characteristics to web function, we developed a web model with spiral and radial threads based on the geometry commonly found in orb webs 1. The silk material behaviour was parameterized from atomistic simulations of dragline silk from the species Nephila clavipes (model A) 16, 17 (Fig. 1 a, b) and validated against experiments 10 (Methods Summary). Properties of silk can vary across evolutionary lineages by over 100 % (refs 9, 27 and 28; Supplementary Information section 1), so we avoided species-specific silk properties and instead used a representative model to reflect the characteristic nonlinear stress–strain (σ–ε) behaviour of silk found in a web.

The most striking similarities are in the codon usage biases of the fibroin genes, particularly in the repetitive regions, as well as sequence conservation of the carboxyl-terminal regions of the fibroins. Based on analyses of the silk genes, we propose hypotheses regarding codon bias and its effect on the translation and replication of these unusual genes. Furthermore, we discuss the significance of specific fibroin motifs to the mechanical and <b>structural</b> characteristics of <b>silk</b> fibers. Lastly, we report that the conservation of webspinner fibroin carboxyl-terminal regions suggests that fiber formation may occur through a mechanism analogous to that found in Lepidoptera.

" Here, we used 13 C solid-state NMR to clarify the heterogeneous structure of the natural fiber from Bombyx mori silk fibroin in the silk II form. Interestingly, the 13 C CP/MAS NMR revealed a broad and asymmetric peak for the Ala Cβ carbon. The relative proportions of the various heterogeneous components were determined from their relative peak intensities after line shape deconvolution. Namely, for 56 % crystalline fraction (mainly repeated Ala-Gly-Ser-Gly-Ala-Gly sequences), 18 % distorted β-turn, 13 % β-sheet (parallel Ala residues), and 25 % β-sheet (alternating Ala residues).

Pilling is a phenomenon which consists of the formation of small balls made out of fibre congeries on the textile’s surface due to attrition and fatigue. For textiles used as liturgical items, the process of pilling formation includes the following stages: the emergence of the pilling surfaces (the formation of fuzzy), fibre tangle (appearance of small balls), and the detachment of small balls from the fabric’s surface. The analysis method of pilling for liturgical items made out the four types of fabrics mentioned above consists of stereoscopic microscopy techniques and electronic microscopy methods (SEM).

40|$|Purpose To {{develop a}} novel 3 -D cell culture model {{with the view}} to {{studying}} the pathomechanisms underlying the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Our central hypothesis is that the <b>silk</b> <b>structural</b> protein fibroin {{used in conjunction with}} cultured human cells can be used to mimic the structural relationships between the RPE and choriocapillaris in health and disease. Methods Co-cultures of human RPE cells (ARPE- 19 cells grown in Miller’s medium) and microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC- 1 cells grown in endothelial culture medium) were established on opposing sides of a synthetic Bruch’s membrane (3 microns thick) constructed from B mori silk fibroin. Cell attachment was facilitated by pre-coating the fibroin membrane with vitronectin (for ARPE- 19 cells) and gelatin (for HMEC- 1 cells) respectively. The effects of tropoelastin on attachment of ARPE- 19 cells was also examined. Barrier function was examined by measurement of trans-epithelial resistance (TER) using a voltohmmeter (EVOM- 2). The phagocytic activity of the synthetic RPE was tested using vitronectin-coated microspheres (2 micron diameter FluoSpheres). In some cultures, membrane defects were created by puncturing within a 24 G needle. The architecture of the synthetic tissue before and after wounding was examined by confocal microscopy after staining for ZO- 1 and F-actin. Results The RPE layer of the 3 D model developed a cobblestoned morphology (validated by staining for ZO- 1 and F-actin), displayed barrier function (validated by measurement of TER) and demonstrated cytoplasmic uptake of vitronectin-coated microspheres. Attachment of ARPE- 19 cells to fibroin was unaffected by tropoelastin. Microvascular endothelial cells attached well to the gelatin-coated surface of the fibroin membrane and remained physically separated from the overlaying RPE layer. The fibroin membranes were amenable to puncturing without collapse thus providing the opportunity to study transmembrane migration of the endothelial cells. Conclusions Synthetic Bruch’s membranes constructed from silk fibroin, vitronectin and gelatin, support the co-cultivation of RPE cells and microvascular endothelial cells. The resulting RPE layer displays functions similar to that of native RPE and the entire tri-layered structure displays potential to be used as an in vitro model of choroidal neovascularization...|$|R
40|$|Among {{a myriad}} of spider web geometries, the orb web {{presents}} a fascinating, exquisite example in architecture and evolution. Its <b>structural</b> component, the <b>silk</b> protein, is an exemplary natural material because its superior properties stem intrinsically from the synergistic cooperativity of hierarchically-organized components, {{rather than from the}} particular properties of the building blocks themselves. By bridging together different levels of hierarchy in the web, we elucidate the mechanisms by which structure at each composite level contributes to organization and material phenomena at subsequent levels, demonstrating that the web is a highly adapted system where both material and hierarchical structure across all length-scales is critical for its functional properties. Further, the material hierarchy scheme within the orb web is exploited to address questions of silk evolution. Spider orb webs can be divided into two categories distinguished by the capture silk used in construction: cribellate orb webs composed of pseudoflagelliform silk coated with dry cribellate threads and ecribellate orb webs, composed of viscid flagelliform silk fibers, coated by adhesive glue droplets. Cribellate capture silk is generally stronger but less extensible than viscid capture silk and a body of phylogenic evidence suggests that cribellate capture silk is more closely related to the ancestral form of capture spiral silk. Here, we use a coarse-grained web model to investigate how the mechanical properties of spiral capture silk affect the behavior of the web system, illustrating that more extensible capture spiral silk yields a decrease in the web's energy absorption, suggesting that the function of the capture spiral shifted from prey capture to other structural roles. Additionally, we observe that in webs with more extensible capture silk, the effect of thread strength on web performance is reduced, indicating that thread extensibility is a dominant driving factor in web diversification. In this thesis, we propose a novel model-centered materials-hierarchy based approach to studying evolutionary trends and suggest possible applications for other fields. by Anna Tarakanova. Thesis: S.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{mechanisms}} behind natural silk spinning by integrating rheology, spectroscopy and small angle scattering {{to better understand}} this process and to guide our efforts towards mimicking Nature’s ways of producing high performance fibres. As a result of natural selection, arthropods such as spiders and moths have evolved the ability to excrete silk proteins in a highly controlled manner. Spun from liquid feedstocks, silk fibres are used ex vivo to build structures with mechanical properties currently unmatched by industrial filaments. As yet, relatively {{little attention has been}} directed to the investigation of spinning under biologically relevant conditions. To better understand how and why silk is spun, this thesis bridges the gap between liquid silk flow properties and structure development. To directly connect the two, I have developed and deployed novel experimental platforms that combine infrared spectroscopy and small angle scattering with rheology. This approach has clarified long-standing ambiguities on the <b>structural</b> root of <b>silk’s</b> apparently complex flow properties. Small angle scattering revealed the length scales involved in the flow induced solidification under a range of spinning conditions. Mo reover, infrared spectroscopy offered a unique perspective into silk’s formation process immediately after excretion. In a similar manner to the post-extrusion tuning of the properties of partly solidified spider silk filaments, this thesis has revealed that silkworm silk fibres are far from completely formed once excreted. One might describe the filaments of mulberry silkworm as seeded molten polymers that form its hydrogen bonding network and crystallises slowly on site. Consequently, it enlightens that post-spinning conditions are equally paramount for silkworm silk, giving an explanation for the relatively poorer mechanical properties. The comparison of silks from a range of species, allowed this hypothesis to be extended to wild silkworm silk. My insights into spinning had the fortuitous repercussion of facilitating silk fibre solubilisation leading to the development of better artificial silk feedstocks flowing like native silks. With these findings, I believe we are now in an improved position to conceive artificial fibres with properties rivalling those of Nature. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
40|$|Spider silk is a {{material}} of extraordinary beauty and utility. From the spider's perspective, it is foremost a building material, {{but also a}} safety net, a sensory organ, a weapon. From a human perspective, it is {{a material}} of extraordinary mechanical properties, an object of artistic and cultural interest, and a valuable window into the evolutionary history of spiders. Historically, {{there have been a}} mere handful of spider silk textiles, the most recent example of which was constructed by Simon Peers and Nicholas Godley. This was an extravagant work of art, and the silk was collected entirely by hand. Though the finished article {{is a testament to the}} beauty of spider silk, it also illustrates the technical challenges associated with obtaining it in any significant quantity. The effects of this scarcity are evident in the lab of David Kaplan at Tufts University. His group has developed a wide variety of applications for silk, but has focused mainly on silkworm silk in spite of spider silk's greater variety and superior mechanical properties. In the wild, spiders use silk for everything from weaving webs and capturing prey to breathing underwater. Shaped by almost every environment on Earth, spider silk has evolved into endless variations and permutations, offering a vast wealth of material knowledge if we can find a way to tap it. A visit to Cheryl Hayashi's spider silk genetics lab at the University of California, Riverside offers a look inside a spider and a glimpse of how genetic research can illuminate the evolution of silk. At the same time, it puts the limits of our knowledge into stark relief. The scarcity of natural spider silk has helped to drive a small industry in bioengineered and synthetic silk research, and also motivated projects that seek to apply the <b>structural</b> principles of <b>silk</b> fibers to other materials. But so far, these efforts are only a pale imitation of the real thing. For now, the spider is keeping her secrets. by Gillian S. Conahan. Thesis (S.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the dynamic mechanical properties of natural silk fibres, mainly from silkworm species Bombyx mori (B. mori) and spider species Nephila edulis, using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, DMTA. The aim {{is not only}} to provide novel data on mechanical properties of silk, but also to relate these properties to the structure and morphology of silk. A systematic approach is adopted to evaluate the effect of the three principal factors of stress, temperature and hydration on the properties and structure of silk. The methods developed in this work are then used to examine commercially important aspects of the ‘quality’ of silk. I show that the dynamic storage modulus of silks increases with loading stress in the deformation through yield to failure, whereas the conventional engineering tensile modulus decreases significantly post-yield. Analyses of the effects of temperature and thermal history show a number of important effects: (1) the loss peak at - 60 °C is found to be associated the protein-water glass transition; (2) the increase in the dynamic storage modulus of native silks between temperature + 25 and 100 °C is due simply to water loss; (3) a number of discrete loss peaks from + 150 to + 220 °C are observed and attributed to the glass transition of different states of disordered structure with different intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Excess environmental humidity results in a lower effective glass transition temperature (Tg) for disordered silk fractions. Also, humidity-dynamic mechanical analysis on Nephila edulis spider dragline silks has shown that the glass transition induces a partial supercontraction, called Tg contraction. This new finding leads to the conclusion of two independent mechanisms for supercontraction in spider dragline silks. Study of three commercial B. mori cocoon silk grades and a variety of processed silks or artificial silks shows that lower grade and poorly processed silks display lower Tg values, and often have a greater loss tangent at Tg due to increased disorder. This suggests that processing contributes significantly to the differences in the structural order among natural or unnatural silks. More importantly, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis is proposed to be a potential tool for quality evaluation and control in silk production and processing. In summary, I demonstrate that DMTA is a valuable analytical tool for understanding the structure and properties of silk, and use a systematic approach to understand quantitatively the important mechanical properties of silk in terms of a generic <b>structural</b> framework in <b>silk</b> proteins.

40|$|Periodontitis is {{a dental}} disease which {{can result in}} a loss of {{integrity}} of the periodontal tissues and lead to eventual tooth loss. Barrier membranes can be used in conjunction with guided bone regeneration (GBR) to help repair the damage caused by periodontitis. GBR promotes and directs the growth of new bone, whilst the barrier membrane secludes the defect site from infiltration by fast growing connective and epithelial tissues which would otherwise fill the defect space. The ideal properties for a barrier membrane are: to have a controllable degradation rate, be biocompatible, prevent surrounding tissues from collapsing into the defect space, and provide cell occlusivity. Current commercial barrier membranes are produced out of materials which are either non-resorbable, requiring a secondary surgery for their extraction, or made from resorbable materials which can have poor structural integrity or degrade into acidic by-products. Silk has had a long history of use as a biomaterial. It degrades into non-toxic components and has adaptable mechanical properties. When used in its regenerated silk fibroin form (RFS), it has recently been used for tissue engineering scaffolds. RSF has several polymorphs of which silk I and silk II are of interest. Silk I is non-crystalline and water soluble while silk II has a crystalline β-sheet structure that is non-water soluble. Silk I converts to silk II upon exposure to methanol, heat treatments and stretching. The ability to transform RSF from a water soluble structure into a non-water soluble structure makes it ideal for a variety of processing techniques. In this thesis, reactive inkjet printing has been investigated as a possible processing method of RSF for the manufacture of barrier membranes. Reactive inkjet printing has been used to control the <b>structural</b> conversion of <b>silk</b> I to silk II by printing different volumes of methanol during film fabrication. It was established that RSF crystallinity (and silk II content) was dependant on the volume of methanol printed. RSF film degradation rate was shown to be related to RSF crystallinity, and hence the volume of printed methanol. Cell studies performed on the RSF films showed that MG- 63 osteosarcoma cells remained metabolically active and continued to proliferate during the duration of the study, as well as showing signs of osteogenic activity. RSF films were investigated with the inclusion of nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) to promote osteogenic activity. nHA/RSF films were produced from a composite ink containing both nHA and RSF. It was found that the inclusion of nHA within the ink impeded the transition of silk I to silk II, and instead increased β-turn structural content, which is an intermediate structure in the transition of silk I to silk II. The inclusion of nHA within the RSF films was shown to improve the osteogenic response of the MG- 63 cells. Overall, the work presented in this thesis has demonstrated {{for the first time that}} reactive inkjet printing can produce biocompatible RSF films with controllable crystallinity and degradation rate. As a result, a controllable degradation rate, the possibility of including bioactive components such as nHA, in addition to the other promising properties of RSF, make reactively inkjet printed RSF as a viable alternative for use as a barrier membrane. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, Internet has been {{established}} as a place for drug markets to expand into a new reality and develop according to new business opportunities. Silk Road {{is one of many}} cryptomarkets that have succeeded online, offering a wide selection of drugs on global level. This thesis deals with the <b>structural</b> aspect of <b>Silk</b> Road and how it is organized, with theories of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari as a theoretical perspective to catch the complexity. Data has been collected through observations of Silk Road 2. 0, the second edition of the Silk Road market concept. More than a thousand screen shots have been captured and hundreds of pages with forum conversations printed to give a complete understanding of the market structure. The online environment has made huge changes in the structure of drug markets, where new opportunities have been offered and restrictions created. As a facilitator of communication without hardly any spatial or timely limits, the Internet has become a place to establish connections around the world. Cryptomarkets are deriving advantages from this new context and have established themselves as a meeting point for entrepreneurs, consumers, and other people wanting drug related information. Markets such as Silk Road are offering an anonymous marketplace and forum where people can stay without being connected to their physical self. This might lead to a more socially equal market, but one cannot ignore existence of online restrictions and risks. The lack of face-to-face contact challenges Silk Road when it comes to trust and security – how can anything be secure when the participants are unidentifiable? Silk Road solves this insecurity by introducing a feedback system and encouraging social interaction to increase the trust level. Leaving feedback has left the consumers with a major power to affect the market; bad comments and rumors are hurtful for the vendors, who in return offer the buyers great customer service to avoid negative feedback. Silk Road s forum is also important because of how the vivid interaction leads to a closer community bond that heightens the level of trust. The closeness among the participants is also increased by similar motivations and goals, which steers the market in a specific direction following the participants lead. But it is still the administrator that enforces rules and delegates roles. Silk Road might seem as a free market, but after a closer look one discovers restrictions and formal boundaries. The restrictions, though, are not involuntarily enforced, but rather desired by the participants {{in order to keep the}} market more stable. Morally decisions such as banning the sale of weapons are taken collectively and forum hierarchies are revealing the level of experience – all to induce trust into the market. Additionally, formal rules are an attempt of creating order, which does increase the trust, but it also seems to leave the participants with a false security. Role divisions are not as formal as they might seem, especially since all the participants can interact in multiple activities crisscrossing their appointed tasks. This is where Deleuze and Guattari s rhizome theory becomes particularly useful. According to their theory, social structures are based on a multitude of connecting nodes and other unnatural attempts to create order. Silk Road s rules and role divisions are accepted as organizing elements in the market, but it is also important to look beyond them to see the chaos that really exists. Nothing is as simple as ordering structures such as binary opposites and hierarchical structures; they need to be placed in a larger rhizomatic structure to see the many connections. Also, this opens up for acceptance of elements from the general society as important influences on Silk Road s structure. Cryptomarkets would not exist without the development of networked technologies and constraints set by law enforcement agencies. Media also has an impact on creating the cryptomarket reality adding to the participants experience and influence on the market structure. Silk Road is also tightly connected to the physical world through drug supplies and postal services. The structure of Silk Road is a complex rhizome, where elements of hierarchical settings and role divisions are important for its totality. But so is also the interplay between different connections both inside and outside the online market. Silk Road is a place for entrepreneurs to enter a structured environment and act as a collective group, while still keeping their individuality. Therefore, the complex structure of Silk Road resembles a controlled entrepreneurial market, where chaos and multiplicity lingers under the seemingly formal structure...|$|R
