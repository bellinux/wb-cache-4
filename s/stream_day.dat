60|$|Then Tom went on down, for he {{was afraid}} of staying near Grimes: and as he went, all the vale looked sad. The red and yellow leaves showered down into the river; the flies and beetles were all dead and gone; the chill autumn fog lay low upon the hills, and {{sometimes}} spread itself so thickly on the river that he could not see his way. But he felt his way instead, following the flow of the <b>stream,</b> <b>day</b> after day, past great bridges, past boats and barges, past the great town, with its wharfs, and mills, and tall smoking chimneys, and ships which rode at anchor in the stream; and now and then he ran against their hawsers, and wondered what they were, and peeped out, and saw the sailors lounging on board smoking their pipes; and ducked under again, {{for he was}} terribly afraid of being caught by man and turned into a chimney-sweep once more. He did not know that the fairies were close to him always, shutting the sailors' eyes lest they should see him, and turning him aside from millraces, and sewer-mouths, and all foul and dangerous things. Poor little fellow, it was a dreary journey for him; and more than once he longed to be back in Vendale, playing with the trout in the bright summer sun. But it could not be. What has been once can never come over again. And people can be little babies, even water-babies, only once in their lives.|$|E

60|$|Now we open Rillage, and now Hillsborough, two of {{the most}} picturesque of headlands; see how their round foreheads of glistening grey shale sink down into two dark, jagged moles, running far out to seaward, and {{tapering}} off, each into a long black horizontal line, vanishing at last beneath its lace-fringe of restless hissing foam. How grand the contrast of the lightness of those sea-lines, with the solid mass which rests upon them! Look, too, at the glaring lights and Tartarean shadows of those chasms and caves, which the tide never leaves, or the foot of man explores; and listen how, at every rush of the long ground-swell, mysterious mutterings, solemn sighs, sudden thunders, as of a pent-up earthquake, boom out of them across the glassy swell. Look at those blasts of delicate vapour that shoot up from hidden rifts, and hang a moment, and vanish; and those green columns of wave which rush mast-high up the perpendicular walls, and then fall back and outward in a waterfall of foam, lacing the black rocks with a thousand snowy streams. There they fall, and leap, and fall again. And so they did yesterday, and the day before; and so they did centuries ago, when the Danes swept past them, battleworn, and sad of heart for the loss of the magic raven flag, from the fight at Appledore, to sit down and starve on 'the island of Bradanrelice, which men call Flat Holms.' Ay, and even so they leapt and fell, before a sail gleamed on the Severn sea, when the shark and the ichthyosaur paddled beneath the shade of tropic forests--now scanty turf and golden gorse. And so they will leap and fall on, on, through the centuries and the ages. O dim abyss of Time, into which we peer shuddering, what will be the end of thee, and of this ceaseless coil and moan of waters? It is true, that when thou shalt be no more, then, too, 'there shall be no more sea;' and this ocean bed, this great grave of fertility, into which all earth's wasted riches <b>stream,</b> <b>day</b> and night, from hill and town, shall rise and become fruitful soil, corn-field and meadow-land; and earth shall teem as thick with living men as bean-fields with the summer bees? What a consummation! At least there is One greater than sea, or time: and the Judge of all the earth will do right.|$|E

50|$|Other {{terms are}} used when {{discussing}} only oil. These terms {{can refer to}} either the production of crude oil at an oil well, the conversion of crude oil to other products at an oil refinery, or the overall consumption of oil by a region or country. One common term is barrels per day (BPD, BOPD, bbl/d, bpd, bd, or b/d) where 1 BPD is equivalent to 0.0292 gallons per minute. One BPD also becomes 49.8 tonnes per year. At an oil refinery, production is sometimes reported as {{barrels per calendar day}} (b/cd or bcd), which is total production in a year divided by the days in that year. Likewise, barrels per <b>stream</b> <b>day</b> (BSD or BPSD) is the quantity of oil product produced by a single refining unit during continuous operation for 24 hours.|$|E

40|$|Australia {{has enjoyed}} near {{self-sufficiency}} in crude oil production {{since the late}} 1960 s but has declined to 80 – 90 % in recent years. This is expected to drop to below 50 % of demand by 2019 – 2020. Southern Pacific Petroleum NL is pioneering the development of breakthrough technology to unlock oil from Australia’s largest oil resource, with 17. 3 billion barrels of oil shale held in ten deposits {{along the coast of}} Central Queensland, Australia. These deposits could support production of more than one million barrels of oil per day, helping to secure oil self-sufficiency for Australia and meet part of a growing oil demand in Asia. The company spent more than A$ 150 million on research and develop-ment before embarking on a demonstration plant to produce oil commer-cially. It is the depth of this research and its application that has provided a sound basis {{for the development of a}} new industry that can help fuel the growing demand for oil in the transportation sector in a way that is environ-mentally responsible. The company’s initial operations at the Stuart deposit, located 15 km north of Gladstone, Central Queensland, is the start of a multi-stage risk-managed approach to developing a shale oil industry using the first-of-a-kind Alberta Taciuk Processor (ATP) technology. Stage 1, a 4, 500 -bpsd (barrels per <b>stream</b> <b>day)</b> demonstration-scale plant, is a 75 : 1 scale-up of a successful laboratory pilot plant developed to proc-ess oil sands in Canada.
