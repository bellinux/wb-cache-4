To detect the <b>suspicious</b> cases <b>of</b> scoliosis the test of Adam it was used: humped presence (suspects of scoliosis); humped absence. The verification of the adaptation of the weight of the school material (WSM) it was done starting from the relationship between PME and body mass (BM), being used the following classification: 10 % of BM = adequate and; > 10 % of BM = inadequate. The associations were verified by chi square. It was detected 71 (49. 7 %) <b>suspicious</b> cases <b>of</b> scoliosis, 40 men and 103 women. In both sexes, the frequency <b>of</b> <b>suspicious</b> cases was larger in the 13 - 15 year-old age group.

There were associations (statistically significant) between suspects of scoliosis WSM for 10 - 12 year-old boys and girls of 10 - 12 and 13 - 15 years. For this group of scholars, the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>suspicious</b> cases <b>of</b> scoliosis was larger in th women, in the older age group and in the individuals with school material with inadequate weight...|$|R

3000|$|To {{make the}} {{detection}} of multiple malicious nodes feasible in practice, we propose a heuristic [...] "onion-peeling approach" [...] that detects the malicious user set in a batch-by-batch way. Initially all nodes {{are assumed to be}} honest. We calculate <b>suspicious</b> level <b>of</b> all users according to their reports. When the <b>suspicious</b> level <b>of</b> a node is beyond certain threshold, it will be considered as malicious and moved into the malicious user set. Reports from nodes in malicious user set are excluded in primary user detection. And the way to calculate suspicious level is updated once the malicious node set is updated. We continue to calculate the <b>suspicious</b> level <b>of</b> remaining nodes until no malicious node can be found.|$|R
