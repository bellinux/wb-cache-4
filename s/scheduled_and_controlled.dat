40|$|Abstract—The EU WINNER {{projects}} have studied OFDM-based packet data systems beyond 3 G that use adaptivity on all timescales to obtain high flexibility and performance. The adaptive transmission in both downlink and uplink is <b>scheduled</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlled</b> at base stations and relay nodes and requires frequent transmission of control information over the downlink. The use of scheduling, adaptive modulation and coding, with fine granularity in both time and space, could potentially result in unrealistic bandwidth demands for such downlink control signaling. The present paper describes how this {{problem has been}} handled within WINNER in two cases: Frequency-adaptive transmission, which allows individual link adaptation within time-frequency resource units and non-frequency adaptive transmission, which averages over the channel variations in the frequency domain. An important tool for limiting the associated control information is to broadcast only a small essential set of control data to all user terminals, using a safe but therefore bandwidth-demanding code rate. The remaining control information is multicast to groups of users with different signal to interference and noise ratios (SINRs). The modulation and code rates of these transmissions are adjusted to the SINRs of these groups. The over-all coded data rate of the control transmission can thereby be reduced to acceptable levels.

40|$|The {{environmental}} conditions in many locations on board maritime vessels can favour {{the proliferation of}} microorganisms associated with microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC). This paper will broadly review {{the internal and external}} environments for ships and submarines, and provide several case histories of MIC in maritime vessels, both merchant marine and naval. The main focus will be consideration of the various complementary approaches required to unequivocally diagnose the presence of MIC, possibly in the presence of alternative corrosion mechanisms, and then to categorise and quantify the microbiological species present. Particular consideration is given to diagnosis that is applicable to field testing, as well as techniques that are more suitable for confirmatory laboratory based testing. Quick but accurate diagnosis is essential on maritime vessels and in shipyards where maintenance activity must be tightly <b>scheduled</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlled,</b> to control costs and to maximise availability. The paper also considers developments in MIC sensors, for monitoring vulnerable regions of maritime vessels, and providing early warning of the risk or onset of MIC so that preventative maintenance activity can be better scheduled. This is part of an industry move towards Condition Based Maintenance, and is equally applicable to minimising the effects of MIC on shore-based infrastructure. Finally, a brief survey of possible mitigation techniques to reduce the propensity or severity of MIC is discussed.

40|$|Literature on {{production}} planning <b>and</b> <b>control</b> has focused {{almost exclusively on}} technical aspects, addressing {{the development and implementation}} of new or existing analytical models for different types of production environments. Recent studies have however shown that organizational factors have a significant impact on the production planning <b>and</b> <b>control</b> performance. The aim of this study has been to develop a capability maturity model that evaluates an organization s ability to take into account the organizational factors in performing the production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> process. This study advances the understanding of how organizational factors influences production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control.</b> This study is motivated by two research questions: (1) How to evaluate the organizational competence in production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control?</b> (2) What is the current level of organizational competence for production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> in a selected case company? To answer these questions, the study utilized a qualitative literature study to examine organizational factors discussed in literature. The capability maturity model is based on these findings and on the organizational maturity levels defined in ISO/IEC 15504 - 7 : 2008. In order to test out the model, a case study at the pipe manufacturer Pipelife Surnadal was conducted. The findings from this research show that organizational factors have a significant impact {{on production}} <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> performance. Organizational factors should therefore not be overlooked. Nine organizational factors of production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> were identified in this study: 1) decision autonomy between shop floor and schedulers, 2) department structure and scheduler location, 3) scheduler training, 4) knowledge and communication facilitation of scheduling interconnections, 5) collaboration during rescheduling, 6) common understanding of problems and constraints, 7) fit between context <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> systems, 8) synchronization of performance indicators, and 9) reduction of compensation tasks. The capability maturity model for organizational competence in production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> evaluates <b>scheduling</b> environments on a five-level maturity scale. The model specifies characteristics and criteria for each level, which make it easy for an environment to evaluate itself and get suggestions for improvement. By using the developed model, the organizational competence of Pipelife Surnadal s <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> function was evaluated. The theory-testing and evaluating case study showed that the model is well fitted for real life situations, and identified some organizational aspects that they should focus on in order to improve their <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> performance.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} question, “How can {{manufacturing}} companies effectively handle {{events that are}} unavoidable in real life uncertain and complex manufacturing environments?” {{within the context of}} production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control.</b> The research was initiated as a part of an 8 -year project called NORMAN (Norwegian Manufacturing Future), www. sfinorman. no, and supported by two other ongoing research projects called SoundChain and MIX with industrial partners. The PhD study took place {{as a part of the}} NORMAN task addressing intelligent handling of events in production control. This task aimed to analyze real-life production <b>control</b> practices, <b>and</b> develop decision support models and systems for multi-level real time <b>control</b> of plants <b>and</b> supply chains. The motivation of the PhD study stems from the challenges created by events that are unforeseen during the initial production planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> decisions. Events are caused by situations such as material shortages, machine breakdowns, rush orders, quality problems and due date changes, when executing <b>and</b> <b>controlling</b> the production operations. These causes can be categorized into resource-related causes (e. g. machine breakdowns) and order-related causes (e. g. order priority changes). Some efforts are made during the initial planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> decisions to mitigate against events, such as keeping safety stocks. However, real life schedulers still use a great deal of effort to monitor and handle events in production execution. “Handling events” refers to a decision making process that consists of identification of the event, evaluation of possible reactions, and choosing the most appropriate action. The decisions taken in response to events are referred as “reactive control decisions”. Effective reactive control decisions for events are critical to avoid unnecessary plan deviations and keep the overall performance high. High performance means keeping commitments to customers while sustaining operational efficiency, which together builds the competitiveness of the firm. Handling events in production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> is a well-studied research topic. Many methods, optimization algorithms, and tools have been developed and proposed in the scientific literature and commercial systems. However, the majority of these theoretical developments are based on simplified and well-defined models of the real life production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> practice, which in reality is much more complex and ill defined. The real life production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> practice is much broader than an optimization problem, incorporating other aspects such as iterative information sharing practices between different parties in the organization. Many scholars recognize this issue as one of the main reasons for the gap between the theory and practice of production scheduling, leading to implementation challenges when attempting to apply theoretical developments in real life practice. The scope of this research encompasses these issues with the aim to contribute to better understanding of how events can be handled effectively in real life production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> practice. The study is built on the hypothesis that the design and development of decision support principles and systems for production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> should consider the dynamics of event handling in real life practice. This hypothesis was inspired by the pioneering studies of McKay and Wiers (1999) and Aytug et al. (2005) that discussed the gap between the theory and practice of production scheduling. Advancing the knowledge on how events are handled and what aspects of real life practice are involved is crucial for bridging the gap between theory and practice. In turn, this will improve the implementation of the decision support principles and systems in real life uncertain and complex manufacturing environments. The research was conducted primarily through the case study methodology, involving four manufacturing companies. Two of the companies were members of the NORMAN consortium and two were partners of SoundChain and MIX projects. Initial studies within the two NORMAN companies provided in depth understanding of the decision making process and interactions that take place when handling events in real life production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> practice. Research further focused on the real life production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> aspects that influence the effectiveness of the decision making process for event handling, through a literature study. The combined findings were then tested and evaluated in all four Norwegian manufacturing companies. Finally, the research addressed the implications of the real life aspects on designing decision support systems for production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> practice. These implications led to the generation of guidelines that were used to develop and propose prototypes of decision support systems for the two NORMAN companies involved in this study. This research contributes both to theory and to practice by increasing the knowledge about the decision making process in real life production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> practice as well as the knowledge on decision support requirements. The findings of this research can be applied further to develop more useful decision support principles and systems, addressing the requirements of real life practice. The main contributions of this thesis are summarized as follows. • A task model for event-driven production control, which describes the stages that are taken to classify and handle different types of events in real life practice. • A decision making framework for event handling in production control, which classifies the decision making patterns when handling events in production control. The framework can guide the development of event handling principles better suited to the decision making patterns and behavior of real life decision makers. • An organizational maturity model for effective production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> practice, which addresses the needs of an organizational environment for establishing and performing effective decisions in production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control.</b> The model can be utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> process in real life practice, as an initial step in the improvement efforts. The auxiliary contributions of the thesis are summarized as follows. • A framework for characterizing the events, which can be utilized to model the events in production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control.</b> • A model for categorizing the events based on their potential impact, which can be utilized in development of event specific principles and algorithms for taking reactive control decisions • A set of guidelines for design and development of a practical decision support system, which analyses and addresses the requirements of real life production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> practice. • Real life case studies on the topic of production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control,</b> that provided additional insights and field-based learnings to the literature The findings and contributions of this thesis imply the following issues to be carefully considered in order to provide more relevant contributions from the production scheduling theory to real life practice: • Prior to developing principles and tools for production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control,</b> there is need for a thorough understanding of the production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> practice in a given context, • The real life production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> aspects that influence the coordination and information sharing efforts when making effectiveness-oriented reactive control decisions are often unique and deserve thorough analysis, • The <b>scheduling</b> context <b>and</b> decision support systems should be modelled and designed in accordance with the identified aspects of the real life production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> practice. Overall, this PhD project has achieved its goals by contributing to broader understanding of the real life production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> practice which is significantly influenced by the real time events.

The tracking <b>and</b> <b>control</b> algorithm is designed to evaluate the cost and work performance of an on-going project at three levels: (1) entire project, (2) housing unit, and (3) subcontractor. The application of this algorithm facilitates the early detection of construction problems, if any, allowing timely corrective actions to be considered. The developed model is implemented as a prototype software system named 'Residential Planner'. In addition to considering various practical aspects, Residential Planner can generate a number of specialized reports to address the diverse needs of the residential development firms. Residential Planner is an effective tool for <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> of housing projects, and its application can lead to savings in project time and cost...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} joint <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> rate <b>control</b> in {{wireless}} networks for multicast traffic is considered. The optimal <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> rate <b>control</b> policy is characterized analytically {{and the effects}} of the current channel conditions are incorporated into the optimal decisions. First, the problem of maximizing the sum throughput of the network is considered <b>and</b> the optimal <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> rate <b>control</b> solution is obtained. Next, the objective of proportional fairness is considered and it is shown that under a restricted set of rate conrol <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> actions the optimal joint <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> rate <b>control</b> policy is of threshold type. Finally, our analytical results are verified through a set of numerical experiments. Our results are valid for multicast, as well as for unicast and broadcast traffic...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: With {{global markets}} and global competition, {{pressures}} {{are placed on}} manufacturing organizations to compress order fulfillment times, meet delivery commitments consistently and also maintain efficiency in operations to address cost issues. This chapter argues for a process perspective on planning, <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> that integrates organizational planning structures, information systems as well as human decision makers. The chapter begins with a reconsideration of the gap between theory and practice, in particular for classical <b>scheduling</b> theory <b>and</b> hierarchical production planning <b>and</b> <b>control.</b> A number of the key studies of industrial practice are then described and their implications noted. A recent model of scheduling practice derived from a detailed study of real businesses is described. Socio-technical concepts are then introduced and their implications for the design and management of planning, <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> systems are discussed. The implications of adopting a process perspective are noted along with insights from knowledge management. An overview is presented of a methodology for the (re-) design of planning, <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> systems that integrates organizational, system and human perspectives. The most important messages from the chapter are then summarized...|$|R
40|$|This Tug Fleet <b>and</b> Ground Operations <b>Schedules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Controls</b> Study {{addresses}} both ground {{operational data}} and technical requirements that span the Tug planning phase and operations phase. A similar study covering mission operations (by others) provides the complimentary flight operations details. The two studies provide the planning data requirements, resource allocation, <b>and</b> <b>control</b> milestones {{for supporting the}} requirements of the STS program. This Tug Fleet <b>and</b> Ground Operations <b>Schedules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Controls</b> Study incorporates the basic ground operations requirements and concepts provided by previous studies with the interrelationships of the planning, IUS transition, and Tug fleet operations phases. The interrelationships of these phases were studied as a system to optimize overall program benefits and minimize operational risk factors...|$|R
