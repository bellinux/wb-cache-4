40|$|The {{following}} work {{provides the}} necessary details to assemble an adaptable enclosure device to protect precision experiments from {{the influence of}} outside factors. Through the use of UV <b>resistant,</b> <b>sound</b> <b>resistant,</b> electric resistant acrylic the enclosure provides a simple means of guaranteeing better data acquisition without the requirement of complex protective mechanisms. The acrylic material used for the design resists UV wavelengths up to 500 nm. The design is also dependant on its adaptability and the ease of manufacturing and use. By machining 14 acrylic sheets and applying magnetic strips to the edges, as well as cutting 12 steel beams, 7 different enclosure sizes can be assemble. There is one smaller box that is 6 inches in height, 4 that are 12 inches in height and {{a wide variety of}} widths and lengths, and two that are 18 inches in height. Because of the design they can also be changed to a new size any point. The enclosure improves the performance of testing on the nanometer level because small influences on the experiment can greatly affect the data collected. This device protects the experiment and the integrity of the data and improves the values recorded by 40 %. The report details the necessary materials, the machining process and the assembly required to create this enclosure device. by Shannon Turner. Thesis (S. B.)

5000|$|The model cottage was {{designed}} by Henry Roberts, who was honorary architect to the SICLC, and, like the Prince Consort, was interested in upgrading housing for the working class. The cottage demonstrated at the Great Exhibition was possibly conceived {{as a model for}} larger blocks of flats (designs for a three-storey version were prepared). It {{was designed}} to house four families, with two flats, or apartments, on each level. Roberts indicated that the design was aimed at “the class of mechanical and manufacturing operatives who usually reside in towns or in their immediate vicinity”. Each flat had a living room, with a built-in cupboard heated by the fireplace that was also [...] "well contrived equally to cook the family meals at midday and to warm the feet of the family group at eve", a kitchen/scullery, three bedrooms and a toilet. Bathrooms were not usually provided in houses built in England at this time. Three bedrooms were included for the sake of [...] "decency" [...] so that children of the same sex would not have to share a room.The most notable external feature was the covered central staircase to give access to the two upper flats. Hollow bricks were used for construction of the building. These were claimed to be <b>sound</b> <b>resistant,</b> damp resistant, non-porous, and cheap to make. The internal face of the walls was smooth and plastering was considered unnecessary.|$|R
40|$|Continuous-flow {{toxicity}} {{tests were}} conducted to determine the relative tolerances of newly hatched alevins, swim-up alevins, parr, and smolts of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and steelhead (Salmo gairdneri) to cadmium, copper, and zinc. Newly hatched alevins were much more tolerant to cadmium and, to a lesser extent, to zinc than were later juvenile forms. However, the later progression from swim-up alevin, through parr, to smolt {{was accompanied by a}} slight increase in metal tolerance. The 96 -h LC 50 values for all four life stages ranged from 1. 0 to> 27 /•g Cd/liter, 17 to 38 /•g Cu/liter, and 93 to 815 /•g Zn/liter. Steelhead were consistently more sensitive to these metals than were chinook salmon. When a sensitive life stage for acute toxicity tests with metals is sought, the more <b>resistant</b> newly <b>hatched</b> alevins should be avoided. Although tolerance may increase with age, all later juvenile life stages are more sensitive and should give similar results. Juvenile anadromous salmonids reside in fresh water for up to 2 yr prior to their mi-gration to the sea, and during their fresh...|$|R
5000|$|To advance {{his career}} in 1990, Larkin moved to Berlin, Germany. From there he {{discovered}} the appreciative jazz culture and started playing jazz gigs. Here he decided to add singing to his act for the first time, inspired by the standing ovation he received for his rendition of the song [...] "On the Sunny Side of the Street". Soon after, his agent Manfred Zähringer from Iceberg Records (Denmark) thought of combining scat-singing with modern dance music and hip hop <b>sounds.</b> Larkin was <b>resistant</b> at first, but BMG Hamburg was open.|$|R

40|$|Rubblization is an in-place {{rehabilitation}} technique that involves breaking the concrete pavement into pieces. This process {{results in a}} structurally <b>sound,</b> rut <b>resistant</b> base layer which prevents reflective cracking (by obliterating the existing concrete pavement distresses and joints) that can then be overlaid with Hot-Mix Asphalt (HMA). The design of the structural overlay thickness for rubblized projects is difficult as the resulting structure is neither a true rigid pavement nor a true flexible pavement. The HMA overlay thickness design methodology currently used {{in the state of}} Iowa is purely empirical. In the Mechanistic-Empirical (M-E) design approach developed for the analysis and design of rubblized concrete pavements in Iowa, the tensile strain {{at the bottom of the}} HMA layer (Îµt) is used to predict fatigue life using an HMA fatigue design algorithm and the vertical compressive strain on top of the subgrade layer (Îµc) is used to consider subgrade rutting. In the current study, the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) -based structural models for predicting the critical strains based on FWD deflection data, is successfully demonstrated. The ANN-based structural models were validated by comparing the ANN-based strain predictions with the field-measured strains from an instrumented trial project at highway IA- 141 located in Polk County, Iowa...|$|R
40|$|Scanning {{electron}} micrographs of the nematode-egg-parasitic fungus Paecilomyces lilacinus infecting eggs of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne spp. {{suggested the}} involvement of lytic enzymes. When grown on a liquid mineral salts medium, supplemented with different substrates as the sole N- and C-source, the fungus produced an extracellular protease. Colloidal chitin, vitellin and intact eggs of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne hapla induced proteolytic activity that was repressed by glucose. The protease was partially purified from the culture filtrate by affinity chromatography. It has a molecular mass of 33. 5 kDa, a pH optimum of 10. 3, a temperature optimum of 60 °C and an isoelectric point above pH 10. 2. The enzyme was completely inhibited by PMSF. The amino acid sequence, as derived from the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone, had high homology with several subtilisin-like serine proteases. It was shown that the purified enzyme degrades vitellin. The protease quantitatively bound to nematode eggs, and eggs incubated with the purified protease eventually floated. Incubation of the purified protease with nematode eggs significantly influenced their development as demonstrated by time-lapse microscopy. Immature eggs were highly vulnerable to protease treatments, whereas those containing a juvenile were more <b>resistant.</b> In addition, <b>hatched</b> larvae were not visibly affected by the protease. It can be concluded that the serine protease might {{play a role in}} penetration of the fungus through the egg-shell of nematodes...|$|R
40|$|Dental Caries is {{a disease}} of great concern which affects people of all races in all places, the exact {{etiology}} of caries though unknown; it is well established that the release of calcium and phosphate from hydroxyapatite crystal is due to decreased pH of saliva. However the relationship between calcium release, pH and time is not well documented. The present {{study was designed to}} assess the calcium release from intact enamel when subjected to different pH at different time intervals. The enamel samples were subjected to acid challenge using Acetate buffer of pH of 3. 5, 4, 4. 5, 5, 5. 5, 6 and 6. 5 and buffer solution were analyzed for calcium release at specific time intervals for each pH using atomic absorption spectrometry. The results show that the rate of calcium release significantly increased from pH 5. 0 to 3. 5, however the calcium release was very little in pH 5. 5 to 6. 5. From the observations made from this study we can conclude that <b>sound</b> enamel is <b>resistant</b> to acid attack between pH of 5 to 5. 5 and Time {{plays an important role in}} the reaction of enamel to acid...|$|R
40|$|A new mean of {{assembling}} steel to aluminiumwas developed, following previouswork by Germanworkers [1]. In this newmethod, a laser-induced aluminium {{melt pool}} spreads and wets a solid steel, to generate, after solidification a <b>sound</b> and <b>resistant</b> interface layer. Joint properties were investigated, {{in terms of}} surface aspects, interface microstructures and mechanical resistances under tensile testing, for non-galvanized and galvanized DC 04 steels. Thermal and diffusional finite element (FE) simulations were also carried out to calculate temperature history at interfaces, and reaction layer thickness. The 2 – 20 m thick reaction layers formed all along the interface {{were found to be}} mostly composed of Fe 2 Al 5 intermetallic compound with a high hardness (1200 HV) and rather low ductility (presence of solidification cracks). The presence of a 10 m thick Zn layer on the steel was shown to have a beneficial influence on the wetting characteristics of the joint, despite the formation of occluded pores in the melt pool due to Zn vaporisation. FE thermal modelling evidenced 760 – 1020 ◦C wetting temperatures at the interface between DC 04 low carbon steel and 6016 aluminium sheets, with time maintains of the melt pool in the 0. 2 – 0. 5 s range, resulting in high-speed reaction kinetics. Using these temperature data, diffusion calculations were shown to provide a rather good prediction of intermetallic thicknesses. Tensile tests were considered on aluminium–steel lap joints and evidenced higher mechanical resistances (220 N/mm linear tensile strength) on galvanized steels, provided that fluxing of the steel surfacewas carried out prior to welding to avoid zinc vaporisation. Comparatively, non-galvanized assemblies exhibited much lower mechanical resistances (170 N/mm resulting in a 90 MPa interfacial shear strength). It was concluded that the laser-induced wetting technique is a rather effective way for generating Al-steel joints without filler material, and that it should be considered as a competitive technique versus solid assembly modes (friction stir welding...) ...|$|R
40|$|Non-galvanized and 10 µm {{zinc-coated}} 1. 2 mm thick DC 04 steel {{was joined}} to 6016 -T 4 aluminium alloy by using three different laser processses : a key-hole welding mode, with a precise {{control of the}} aluminium – steel dilution, a reactive wetting mode where solid steel – liquid aluminium reaction occurred driving to a uniform Fe 2 Al 5 intermetallic layer between the two overlapped sheets and a braze-welding mode involving direct fusion of aluminium and an Al- 12 Si filler wire on solid steel. For liquid aluminium to liquid steel interactions obtained by key-hole mode, rather <b>sound</b> and <b>resistant</b> assemblies were realized either on non-galvanized or galvanized steel provided steel was placed upon aluminium with penetration in aluminium limited to 0. 5 mm. The influence of galvanized layer was only detectable on the fusion zone of aluminium where occluded zinc bubbles were observed. Mechanical resistances of 150 N/mm were obtained for one joint assemblies and could be increased up to 250 N/mm making two joints per assembly. For liquid aluminium to solid steel interactions carried out by defocused laser, 180 N/mm transverse tensile strengths were obtained on non-galvanized steels by using a brazing flux. Due to a better wetting on non-galvanized steels, good assemblies could be obtained without using flux leading to lower mechanical resistances of up to 140 N/mm. However, using flux conduced to 220 N/mm maximal mechanical resistance. For this kind of interaction solid/liquid), using an Al- 12 Si filler wire allows to obtained also 180 N/mm mechanical strengths on non-galvanized steels using a brazing flux. Same characteristics are obtained in the reaction layers composition with a decrease in maximal layer thickness under 1 µm compared to the 2 - 40 µm thickness obtained without filler wire. Finally, comparisons are made between the three processes investigated focusing on the mechanical properties and the robustness of each process...|$|R
5000|$|Hopper {{recalled}} [...] "John Robie {{was a big}} flashy, Arthur Baker-style producer; it was all {{beats and}} polished <b>sounds.</b> I was <b>resistant</b> to it, I respected him as a producer but I didn’t think he was suitable for Stump. If you listen to Stump songs they are very simple chords, they’re not sophisticated, they’re not like listening to a Cole Porter song or something like that, they are just major and minor chords usually. The interlocking drums and bass and the broken up mosaic style of the music is all about arrangement. I don’t think John Robie saw that as relevant, he just looked through all that to the melody, the rhythm, and the chords he didn’t look at the arrangement, which was what Stump's music was all about. It was an awful situation." [...] The band thought of Steve Albini as a possible third producer to finish the album, but ultimately Jones was brought back to [...] "clean up the mess" [...] and finish the recordings at Britannia Row Studios in North London. Jones recalled that, by the point he rejoined the sessions, [...] "the recording was finished; I was just there to mix it really. It happens a lot I think, once you get past that first ‘bang out stuff that you’ve done on stage for the last year’ bit which {{is relatively easy to}} do, it gets into second album syndrome, it's such a cliché." [...] Hopper, nonetheless, stated the band were happy with the way the album turned out.|$|R
40|$|AbstractOn Tuesday April 28, 2009 {{a report}} for BBC {{displayed}} {{an interview with}} a Palestinian citizen rebuilt his destroyed house with mud brick and mentioned that, it is a shame to live in a mud house at this age. The researcher was struck by this interview which led to work on this research. Due to the siege, the Palestinians lost the hope to reconstruct their destroyed homes, public buildings and infrastructure. Building with mud bricks as a thermal insulation and environmentally friendly method, works as a fire <b>resistant,</b> <b>sound</b> proof and can be entirely chemical free. It is cheaper; 80 m 2 house made of cement would cost around 16, 000 dollars at least, but a mud one with local materials cost just 3, 000 dollars. Best of all, it can be made on site in any shape, color or size, made of a mixture of clay, mud, sand, and water mixed with a binding material such as rice husks or straw. Mud bricks fulfill the compressive strength and heat conductivity requirements. It also keeps indoor temperatures stationary during the summer and winter as a thermal insulation method. It is a traditional building material in much of the Middle East, India, North Africa and the majority of the Islamic cities buildings. Recently, there have been attempts to revive the use of mud brick through special projects such as those instigated by Hassan Fathy in Egypt, the beautiful Cob House on Mayne Island, Canada, etc. The mud bricks aim to save energy. The energy crisis experienced in the past have shifted the focus of the economical gain to energy saving. The research will display all the successful methods of building with mud bricks in order to extract different recommendations from it. this will be a guide for anyone who want to build his own house in a wonderful form, shape, style and colors. Besides different recommendations for the governmental institutions to encourage the citizens to reconstruct their homes by this method and construct models of mud houses to teach the citizens how to build their own homes? Finally, earthen structures are cheap, environmentally friendly and it is not a shame to live in a mud house but it is a global trend to preserve and to protect the environment...|$|R
