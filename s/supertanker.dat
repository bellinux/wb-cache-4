5|$|The {{production}} team returned briefly to the UK {{to shoot at}} the Faslane submarine base before setting off to Spain, Portugal and the Bay of Biscay where the <b>supertanker</b> exteriors were filmed.

5|$|It {{was shot}} on {{location}} in Egypt (Cairo and Luxor) and Italy (Costa Smeralda, Sardinia), with underwater scenes filmed at the Bahamas (Nassau), and a new soundstage built at Pinewood Studios for a massive set which depicted {{the interior of a}} <b>supertanker.</b> The Spy Who Loved Me was well-received by critics. The soundtrack composed by Marvin Hamlisch also met with success. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards amid many other nominations and novelised in 1977 by Christopher Wood as James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
5|$|At a dock {{owned by}} Shell Oil Company in Deer Park near Houston, a {{lightning}} bolt from thunderstorms of Elena struck the oil <b>supertanker</b> SS Chevron Hawaii. The lightning started a fire on the ship, which expanded and wrecked one adjacent barge and burned nearby docks. The ship was nearly split in half from the lightning strike, and oil seeped into Houston Ship Channel for several hours. Firefighters combated the fire on the tanker in boats, but their efforts were hindered due to unsettled weather from Elena, as well as unsafe water to travel through. The fire caused three deaths and 13 injuries, and damage related to the incident totaled $27 million (1979 USD, $76 million 2007 USD).|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Elena was a weak {{tropical}} storm that moved ashore along Texas in the 1979 Atlantic hurricane season. The sixth {{tropical storm}} of the season, Elena developed from a tropical wave {{to the south}} of Louisiana on August 29. It tracked generally west-northwest, strengthening little before making landfall on Matagorda Island on September 1 as a minimal tropical storm; the storm quickly dissipated over land. Elena dropped moderate rainfall along its path, causing two direct deaths in Houston from drowning; storm damage was minor, amounting to less than $10 million (1979 USD, $28 million 2007 USD). Lightning from the storm set fire to an oil <b>supertanker</b> in Houston, causing three indirect deaths and 13 injuries.|$|E
5|$|While {{travelling}} {{by train}} to Stromberg's base in Sardinia, Bond saves Amasova from Jaws, and their cooling rivalry turns to affection. Posing as a marine biologist and his wife, they visit Stromberg's base and discover {{that he had}} launched a mysterious new <b>supertanker,</b> the Liparus, nine months previously. As they leave the base, an unknown henchman on a motorcycle featuring a rocket sidecar, Jaws in a car, and Naomi, an assistant/pilot of Stromberg in an attack helicopter, chase them, but Bond and Amasova escape underwater when his car – a Lotus Esprit from Q Branch – converts into a submarine. Jaws survives a car crash and Naomi is killed when Bond fires a sea-air missile from his car which destroys her helicopter. The pair also encounter a fleet of Stromberg's minisubs which Amasova obliterates by launching mines. Bond finds out that the Liparus has never visited any known port or harbor. Amasova discovers that Bond killed her lover (as shown {{at the beginning of}} the movie), and she vows to kill Bond as soon as their mission is complete.|$|E
25|$|The Manhattan was a {{specially}} reinforced <b>supertanker</b> sent {{to test the}} viability of the passage for the transport of oil. While the Manhattan succeeded, the route was deemed not to be cost effective. The United States built the Alaska Pipeline instead.|$|E
5000|$|Because of this depth, {{engineers}} chose Charco Azul as {{the site}} of a port for use by <b>supertankers.</b> As the dock is only 300 feet long, many captains of these <b>supertankers</b> worried that they would run aground, but the water is deep enough to support the largest ones. In fact, one can see deepwater fish swimming just underneath the dock.|$|R
5|$|Because {{of their}} great size, <b>supertankers</b> often cannot enter port fully loaded. These ships {{can take on}} their cargo at {{off-shore}} platforms and single-point moorings. On {{the other end of}} the journey, they often pump their cargo off to smaller tankers at designated lightering points off-coast. A <b>supertanker's</b> routes are generally long, requiring it to stay at sea for extended periods, up to and beyond seventy days at a time.|$|R

25|$|In the 1960s, notable {{achievements}} for {{the yard}} included the tanker Myrina, {{which was the}} first <b>supertanker</b> built in the UK and the largest vessel ever launched down a slipway (September 1967).

This was a first and only time this was ever done.|$|E

500|$|Ken Adam {{returned}} as production designer. As no studio stages were {{big enough for}} {{the interior of the}} villain Karl Stromberg's <b>supertanker,</b> in March 1976 construction began of a new sound stage at Pinewood, the 007 Stage, which cost $1.8 million and became the largest stage in the world. In contrast to the volcano crater set Adam had built for You Only Live Twice in 1966—which Adam had called [...] "a workable but ultimately wasteful set"—the 007 Stage would be a permanent structure that could be rented out to other productions. Secondary filming began in July 1976 at Baffin Island, where the ski jump for the opening credits was filmed. Principal filming commenced in Sardinia in August 1976, moving on to Egypt shortly afterwards. Further filming took place in Sardinia, Malta, Japan, Switzerland and the Faslane submarine base. On 5 December 1976, with principal photography finished, the 007 Stage was formally opened by the former Prime Minister Harold Wilson.|$|E

500|$|As no {{studio was}} big enough for the {{interior}} of Stromberg's <b>supertanker,</b> and set designer Ken Adam {{did not want to}} repeat what he had done with SPECTRE's volcano base in You Only Live Twice— [...] "a workable but ultimately wasteful set"— construction began in March 1976 of a new sound stage at Pinewood, the 007 Stage, at a cost of $1.8 million. To complement this stage, Eon also paid for building a water tank capable of storing approximately 1,200,000 gallons (5,500,000 litres). The soundstage was so huge that cinematographer Claude Renoir found himself unable to effectively light it due to his deteriorating eyesight, and so Stanley Kubrick visited the production, in secret, to advise on how to light the stage. For the exterior, while Shell was willing to lend an abandoned tanker to the production, the elevated insurance and safety risks caused it to be replaced with miniatures built by Derek Meddings' team and shot in the Bahamas. Stromberg's shark tank was also filmed in the Bahamas, using a live shark in a saltwater swimming pool. Adam decided to do experiments with curved shapes for the scenery, as he felt all his previous setpieces were [...] "too linear". This was demonstrated with the Atlantis, which is a dome and curved surfaces outside, and many curved objects in Stromberg's office inside. For Gogol's offices, Adam wanted an open space to contrast M's enclosed headquarters, and drew inspiration from Sergei Eisenstein to do a [...] "Russian crypt-like" [...] set.|$|E
