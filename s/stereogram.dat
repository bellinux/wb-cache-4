Stereoscopic perception depends on spatial information for <b>stereograms</b> generated with variations along tritan confusion lines. For observers who perceive stereopsis via tritan directions, the results show a gradation in the disparity range, with the disparity range for <b>stereograms</b> generated by luminance variations being greater than for <b>stereograms</b> generated in red-green directions; the latter range is, in turn, greater than for <b>stereograms</b> generated along tritan directions. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Unrestricted {{positioning}} of elements in random-dot <b>stereograms</b> with steep disparity gradients, such as stereo-transparent <b>stereograms</b> depicting overlaid surfaces, can produce perceptual artifacts similar to disparity noise. It is shown that these artifacts hinder the segregation of overlaid surfaces in transparent random-dot <b>stereograms</b> and thus disrupt {{the perception of}} stereotransparency. This effect is intensified with increases in the overall element density of the stimuli. We outline {{the origin of this}} phenomenon and discuss techniques to prevent such artifacts. ...|$|R

A simple operation for random-dot <b>stereograms</b> converts the stereo correspondence problem to the segmentation one. For solving the segmentation problem derived from random-dot <b>stereograms,</b> the stereo vision system proposed here utilizes the grouping process of our previously proposed model. The model for the grouping process consists of multiple reaction-diffusion models, each of which governs segments having a disparity in the stereo vision system. A self-inhibition mechanism due to strong inhibitory diffusion within a particular reaction-diffusion model and a mutual-inhibition mechanism among the models are built in the proposed system.

40|$|As {{computer}} generated holograms becomes more common, the fast computation of holographic interference patterns in digital environment becomes a necessity. Since the computation time of holograms via Fresnel (or Rayleigh-Sommerfeld) diffraction models makes real time applications impossible, the holographic <b>stereograms</b> are developed to be {{a solution for}} this problem. Holographic <b>stereograms</b> divide the hologram plane into segments. In phase added <b>stereograms</b> the coordinates of 3 D source points are used while calculating the diffraction field. And that enables to calculate the diffraction field with appropriate sized FFTs. Although the phase added <b>stereograms</b> are advantageous in terms of computation time, {{the quality of the}} reconstructed three dimensional images may not be satisfactory. The main reason is that the diffraction field of a given point source is approximated as a pure complex sinusuoid in each segment. To increase the reconstruction quality, we propose a method that uses variable sized segments, as opposed to previously developed holographic <b>stereograms</b> that use fixed sized segments. While approximating the diffraction field of a point source, higher frequency regions are covered with smaller segments and lower frequency regions with larger segments. As a result of this, we keep the total number of oscillations of pure sinusoidal waves constant in each segment. The simulations that we carried out for a point source show that we are able to obtain better quality reconstruction with our method. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} extract retinal {{disparity}} from a visual scene, the brain must match corresponding {{points in the}} left and right retinae. This computationally demanding task is known as the stereo correspondence problem. The initial stage of the solution to the correspondence problem is generally thought to consist of a correlation-based computation. However, recent work by Doi et al suggests that human observers can see depth in a class of stimuli where the mean binocular correlation is 0 (half-matched random dot <b>stereograms).</b> Half-matched random dot <b>stereograms</b> are made up of an equal number of correlated and anticorrelated dots, and the binocular energy model-a well-known model of V 1 binocular complex cells-fails to signal disparity here. This has led to the proposition that a second, match-based computation must be extracting disparity in these stimuli. Here we show that a straightforward modification to the binocular energy model-adding a point output nonlinearity-is by itself sufficient to produce cells that are disparity-tuned to half-matched random dot <b>stereograms.</b> We then show that a simple decision model using this single mechanism can reproduce psychometric functions generated by human observers, including reduced performance to large disparities and rapidly updating dot patterns. The model makes predictions about how performance should change with dot size in half-matched <b>stereograms</b> and temporal alternation in correlation, which we test in human observers. We conclude that a single correlation-based computation, based directly on already-known properties of V 1 neurons, can account for the literature on mixed correlation random dot <b>stereograms...</b>|$|R
