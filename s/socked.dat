Straight cargo operations were hazardous enough, especially during the monsoon season when South Vietnamese troops were <b>socked</b> in within the mountainous valleys. To execute the mission, the C-123s would line up in a proper direction, let down in the undercast, {{and if they did}} not break out by a given altitude, would climb back up.

25|$|Upon the squadron's {{arrival in}} Brisbane, its {{aircraft}} {{had not yet}} arrived. The ground crews were pressed into service as ground crews for the 19th Bombardment Group's B-17F Flying Fortresses. Since the 3d Bomb Group had no aircraft available and since additional training was necessary, it did not begin operations immediately. On 6 March, the Squadron moved to Charters Towers, where an airfield and a camp were hurriedly built (Breddan Airfield) while the air crews trained with their A-24 dive bombers. On 31 March, the air echelon flew north to Port Moresby, New Guinea and the 8th was again at war. On 1 April 1942 the 3d Bomb Group flew their first combat mission of World War II. Six A-24's were headed for Japanese Lae Airfield in Eastern New Guinea. Lae was <b>socked</b> in by weather so they diverted to Salamaua and attacked Japanese forces occupying the town. They dropped 5 bombs in their first combat mission since November 1918.|$|E
25|$|The 1908 pennant {{races in}} both the AL and NL {{were among the most}} {{exciting}} ever witnessed. The conclusion of the National League season, in particular, involved a bizarre chain of events, {{often referred to as the}} Merkle Boner. On September 23, 1908, the New York Giants and Chicago Cubs played a game in the Polo Grounds. Nineteen-year-old rookie first baseman Fred Merkle, later to become one of the best players at his position in the league, was on first base, with teammate Moose McCormick on third with two outs and the game tied. Giants shortstop Al Bridwell <b>socked</b> a single, scoring McCormick and apparently winning the game. However, Merkle, instead of advancing to second base, ran toward the clubhouse to avoid the spectators mobbing the field, which at that time was a common, acceptable practice. The Cubs' second baseman, Johnny Evers, noticed this. In the confusion that followed, Evers claimed to have retrieved the ball and touched second base, forcing Merkle out and nullifying the run scored. Evers brought this to the attention of the umpire that day, Hank O'Day, who after some deliberation called the runner out. Because of the state of the field O'Day thereby called the game. Despite the arguments by the Giants, the league upheld O'Day's decision and ordered the game replayed at the end of the season, if necessary. It turned out that the Cubs and Giants ended the season tied for first place, so the game was indeed replayed, and the Cubs won the game, the pennant, and subsequently the World Series (the last Cubs Series victory until 2016).|$|E

2500|$|Contrary to British opinion, King was {{a strong}} believer in the Germany first strategy. However, his natural {{aggression}} did not permit him to leave resources idle in the Atlantic that could be utilized in the Pacific, especially when [...] "it was doubtful when — if ever — the British would consent to a cross-Channel operation". King once complained that the Pacific deserved 30% of Allied resources but was getting only 15%. When, at the Casablanca Conference, he was accused by Field-Marshal Sir Alan Brooke of favoring the Pacific war, the argument became heated.

2500|$|Perhaps {{appropriately}} for a cold war, {{the relationship}} between the East and West German border guards and officials was frosty. As a Bayerische Grenzpolizei report of 1968 noted, [...] "the conduct of the Soviet zone [...] border troops continued unfriendly and uncooperative. Officers and officials only sought contact to obtain information about refugees or to influence the border population with their propaganda." [...] There was very little official face-to-face interaction between the two sides on the ground, as the East German border guards were under orders not to speak to Westerners. Klaus Grünzner, a former West German border guard, later recalled: [...] "I served ... for eight years and the East German police never said a single word to us, except in 1974 during the World Cup, when East Germany beat us. One of the guards shouted at us: 'Sparwasser [...] really <b>socked</b> it to you!'" [...] After the initiation of détente between East and West Germany in the 1970s, the two sides established procedures for maintaining formal contacts through fourteen direct telephone connections or Grenzinformationspunkt (GIP, [...] "border information point"). They were used to resolve local problems affecting the border, such as floods, forest fires or stray animals.|$|E

2500|$|As a young man, Chrétien {{was well}} known for his love of violence, and as someone who relished his {{reputation}} as a local tough guy who was most happy when punching out his fellow students. One of Chrétien's classmates recalled that he was much feared on the account of his [...] "atrocious temper". Chrétien attended Séminaire Saint-Joseph de Trois-Rivières and studied law at Université Laval. As a student at Trois-Rivières, Chrétien later recalled that his best day at that school was his first day when he attacked without provocation another student taller than himself, leading him to proudly remember that: [...] "I really <b>socked</b> it to him bad. In front of everybody!". Chrétien recalled that his assault was meant to send the message to the other students: [...] "Don't mess with Chrétien!". When asked in an interview by his biographer Lawrence Martin about what subject he was best at in high school, Chrétien replied: [...] "It was street fighting that I was best at". Despite the thuggish image that he cultivated at Séminaire Saint-Joseph, Chrétien's grades were high, with an education that focused mostly on Catholic theology, the classics, philosophy, and French, though Chrétien resisted the efforts of the priests to have him speak Parisian French. When Chrétien graduated from Séminaire Saint-Joseph, Duplessis came to address the class and upon meeting Chrétien asked him if his grandfather was François Chrétien, who once served as maylor of St-Étiene-des-Grès and his father was Wellie Chrétien, and upon receiving affirmative answers to both questions, said with disgust: [...] "Then you're a damn rouge". Chrétien's grades were sufficiently good to allow him to attend Laval, the training ground of the French-Canadian elite.|$|E
