5|$|According to e-mails {{released}} in the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, Millionaire narrowly avoided cancellation after the 2014–15 season. The show's declining ratings prompted DADT to demand a dramatically reduced licensing fee for renewal, which SPE was hesitant to accept. The series was nonetheless renewed for the 2015–16 season, with various cuts to the show's production budget {{and a return to}} the original format (but with only 14 questions). Had the show not been renewed, SPE would have placed the show on extended hiatus for three years, reclaimed full rights to the show (without the innovations and format added in the syndicated run, to which DADT owns intellectual property rights), and <b>shopped</b> the revived show to another network or syndicator. In January 2017, it was announced that Millionaire has been renewed through 2018.|$|E

5|$|Bergstein then <b>shopped</b> {{the script}} around to other studios but was {{repeatedly}} rejected, until she {{brought it to}} Vestron Pictures, the newly formed studio division of Stamford, Connecticut, based Vestron Inc., the leading independent home video distribution company. While honing their pitch to Vestron, Gottlieb and Bergstein chose Emile Ardolino as the film's director, who had won the 1983 Academy Award for the documentary, He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin'. Ardolino had never directed a feature film, but was extremely passionate about the project; he even sent a message {{from where he was}} sequestered on jury duty, insisting that he was the best choice as director. The team of Gottlieb, Bergstein, and Ardolino then presented their vision for the film to Vestron's president, Jon Peisinger, and the company's vice president for production, Mitchell Cannold. By the end of the meeting, Peisinger had greenlighted the project to become Vestron's first feature film production. The approved film was budgeted at the relatively low amount of $5million, {{at a time when the}} average cost for a film was $12million.|$|E
5|$|During {{their brief}} existence, Wicked Lester {{performed}} in public twice. The first show {{took place at}} the Rivoli Theatre in South Fallsburg, New York on April 23, 1971. The second, in late summer 1971, was at an Atlantic City, New Jersey hotel hosting a B'nai B'rith Youth Organization event. Not long after that show, the band suffered a major setback when they had all of their musical gear stolen. After a chance meeting with Electric Lady Studios engineer Ron Johnsen, Wicked Lester was given the opportunity to record some demos in late 1971. Johnsen, who produced the demo tape, <b>shopped</b> it to a few labels, with no success. Eventually the tape was screened by Epic Records, who purchased the masters and agreed to fund the recording of a full album. One of the conditions, however, was that Stephen Coronel be fired and replaced with a better guitarist.|$|E

Before leaving the eastern US, the King met with Thomas Edison to have a demonstration of electric lights, and visited Virginia's Fort Monroe. He toured Hampton Normal and Agricultural School, and <b>shopped</b> for horses in Kentucky. The royal party boarded a train to California, where they were house guests of Claus Spreckels at his estate in Aptos (near Santa Cruz), and had {{a few days of}} seeing the sights in the area before sailing back to Hawaii. Kalākaua was successful in jump-starting new immigration, with the first transplants arriving in Hawaii less than a year later. In the years that followed, he began emulating the lifestyles of European royalty with expensive furnishings in Iolani Palace, a public coronation of himself, and a two-week public celebration of his birthday.|$|E

5|$|The next season, the Yellow Jackets {{joined the}} EAHL. Brimsek {{finished}} with the most wins and shutouts of any goal tender in the league with 20 and 8 respectively. At {{the end of the}} season, he was named to the league's Second All-Star Team and he was awarded the George L. Davis Trophy for having the lowest goals against average (GAA). Impressed by Brimsek, Harris wanted to protect his interests in the goalie so he ironically had the Red Wings put Brimsek on their protected list. Harris then tried to get the Red Wings to call Brimsek up. However, the Red Wings wanted Brimsek to first play one year for their amateur team in Pontiac, but Brimsek turned down the offer. Brimsek opted to stay with the Yellow Jackets instead. Harris then <b>shopped</b> Brimsek around the NHL until he was accepted by the Boston Bruins in October 1937. The Bruins were already well established in net with future hall-of-famer Tiny Thompson. This led to Brimsek being assigned by the Bruins to the Providence Reds of the International-American Hockey League (IAHL) for the 1937–38 season. In his only full season with the Reds, Brimsek helped his team win the Calder Cup and he was named to the league's First All-Star Team.|$|E

40|$|<b>Shopping</b> {{is a daily}} {{necessary}} {{activity to}} {{most of the people in}} Hong Kong. From the old days when people went <b>shopping</b> in the bazaars to the recent days when most people go <b>shopping</b> in <b>shopping</b> centres, the dominant mode of <b>shopping</b> changed. The effects brought by different kinds of <b>shopping</b> facilities to people are worth studying. It is not difficult to observe the trend that old retail developments in old districts are mainly <b>shopping</b> streets while new retail developments in new towns are mainly <b>shopping</b> centres. Some voices from the public are pushing the retaining of old street <b>shops</b> and old street cultures despite the property developers tend to build <b>shopping</b> centres in their new projects. The benefits from <b>shopping</b> streets and <b>shopping</b> centres to shoppers and developers have been studied in this dissertation by empirical and conceptual background study, survey to shoppers and <b>shop</b> operators and information provided by property agents and employees of private developers. From socialization point of view, the comprehensive tenant mix and comfortable <b>shopping</b> environment in <b>shopping</b> centres attract shoppers to stay longer in <b>shopping</b> centres than in <b>shopping</b> streets which increase the chance of interaction among shoppers thus improve their level of social lives. However, the stability of <b>shops</b> and <b>shop</b> operators in <b>shops</b> at <b>shopping</b> streets is beneficial to building up community strength within the neighbourhood. The relationships among shoppers and <b>shop</b> operators and among <b>shop</b> operators in <b>shopping</b> streets are stronger than that in <b>shopping</b> centres. For the benefits other than socialization aspect, <b>shops</b> in <b>shopping</b> streets provide cheaper goods due to the relatively lower rents and lower overhead costs in <b>shopping</b> streets while <b>shopping</b> centres provide better accessibility and better facilities due to their better management. For the benefits to developers, developing <b>shopping</b> centres is beneficial to them in the ways of increasing their rental income when leasing retail premises and boosting the selling prices of residential properties where <b>shopping</b> centre is a bundle of the development. In some of the projects of official organizations, such as Urban Renewal Authority, we can see that benefits from these two <b>shopping</b> facilities can be merged together. For example, the design of <b>shopping</b> streets and the buildings around and setting up greenery areas along <b>shopping</b> streets can improve the air-conditioning problem and improve the attractiveness of staying to shoppers. Private developers also introduced old <b>shops</b> to their <b>shopping</b> centres. Product prices of old <b>shops</b> remain the same in <b>shopping</b> centre as in <b>shopping</b> streets. However, the relationship among shoppers and <b>shop</b> operators cannot be copied easily even if the old <b>shop</b> signs are the same. Time is needed for building the strength within a community. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R
