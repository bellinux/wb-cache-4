The unique presence of high energy, multicharged (HZE) particles and full-range ultraviolet irradiation in space prompted evaluation of the response of single cells to these factors.

40|$|Abstract Background Rapid {{increase}} in multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) production for their industrial and biomedical applications {{has led to}} concerns over the effects of MWCNTs on {{human health and the}} environment. Both animal and in vitro studies have provided important findings about MWCNT-induced effects on the lung cells or tissues. In vitro studies have provided a considerable amount of fundamental information on MWCNT-induced effects on the specific lung cells. However, the <b>cell</b> culture <b>systems</b> used in those studies were limited by the absence of dynamic nature of lung tissues. We hypothesized that MWCNT-induced cellular responses such as proliferation, inflammation, and oxidative stress under dynamic cell growth environment may differ from those under <b>static</b> <b>cell</b> growth environment. Results In this study, we used a dynamic cell growth condition to mimic mechanically dynamic environment of the lung and characterized interleukin 8 (IL- 8), reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), and cell proliferation for three days following exposure of MWCNTs at different concentrations (5, 10, and 20 μg/ml) to A 549 cell monolayer under both <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>cell</b> growth conditions. Our results demonstrated the distinct differences in the levels of inflammatory response and oxidative stress between <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>cell</b> growth conditions. Conclusions In conclusion, the dynamic <b>cell</b> growth <b>system</b> used in this study provided important changes in cellular responses that were not found in the <b>static</b> <b>cell</b> growth <b>system</b> and were similar to animal studies. The dynamic <b>cell</b> growth <b>system</b> can be considered as a viable alternative to in vivo test system in combination with existing in vitro <b>static</b> <b>cell</b> growth <b>systems</b> to evaluate the effect of MWCNTs on cellular responses in the respiratory system. </p...|$|R

We examinedthe diffusion and metabolism of BPA using viable skin models: human skin explants and short-term culturesof pig ear skin, an alternative model {{for the study of}} the fate of xenobiotics following contact exposure. 14 C-BPA [50 – 800 nmol] was applied on the surface of skin models. Radioactivity distribution wasmeasured in all skin compartments and in the diffusion <b>cells</b> of <b>static</b> <b>cells</b> diffusion <b>systems.</b> BPA andmetabolites were further quantified by radio-HPLC. BPA was efficiently absorbed in short-term cultures,with no major difference between the models used in the study [viable pig ear skin: 65 %; viable humanexplants: 46 %; non-viable (previously frozen) pig skin: 58 %]. BPA was extensively metabolized in viablesystems only. Major BPA metabolites produced by the skin were BPA mono-glucuronide and BPA monosulfate,accounting together for 73 % and 27 % of the dose, in pig and human, respectively. In conclusion,experiments with viable skin models unequivocally demonstrate that BPA is readily absorbed and metabolizedby the skin. The trans-dermal route is expected to contribute substantially to BPA exposure inhuman, when direct contact with BPA (free monomer) occurs...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of {{enterovirus}} {{infection is}} difficult in animals because they express different virus receptors than humans, and <b>static</b> <b>cell</b> culture <b>systems</b> do not reproduce the physical {{complexity of the}} human intestinal epithelium. Here, using coxsackievirus B 1 (CVB 1) as a prototype enterovirus strain, we demonstrate that human enterovirus infection, replication and infectious virus production can be analyzed in vitro in a human Gut-on-a-Chip microfluidic device that supports culture of highly differentiated human villus intestinal epithelium under conditions of fluid flow and peristalsis-like motions. When CVB 1 was introduced into the epithelium-lined intestinal lumen of the device, virions entered the epithelium, replicated inside the cells producing detectable cytopathic effects (CPEs), and both infectious virions and inflammatory cytokines were released in a polarized manner from the cell apex, {{as they could be}} detected in the effluent from the epithelial microchannel. When the virus was introduced via a basal route of infection (by inoculating virus into fluid flowing through a parallel lower 'vascular' channel separated from the epithelial channel by a porous membrane), significantly lower viral titers, decreased CPEs, and delayed caspase- 3 activation were observed; however, cytokines continued to be secreted apically. The presence of continuous fluid flow through the epithelial lumen also resulted in production of a gradient of CPEs consistent with the flow direction. Thus, the human Gut-on-a-Chip may provide a suitable in vitro model for enteric virus infection and for investigating mechanisms of enterovirus pathogenesis...|$|R

Optimal cells of a particular period may not be optimal for other periods due to possible variations of production requirements of different product mixes (Niakan et al. 2016; Deep and Singh 2016). According to Niakan et al.

40|$|<b>Static</b> <b>cell</b> {{culture has}} serious {{limitations}} {{in its ability}} to represent cellular behaviour within a live organism. In vivo, cells are constantly exposed to the flow of bodily fluids and contact with other cell types. Bioreactors provide the opportunity to study cells in an environment that more closely resembles the in vivo setting because cell cultures can be exposed to dynamic flow in contact with or in proximity to other cell types. In this study we compared the metabolic profile of a dynamic <b>cell</b> culture <b>system</b> to that of a <b>static</b> <b>cell</b> culture in three different cellular phenotypes: adipocytes, endothelial cells and hepatocytes. Albumin, glucose, free fatty acids, glycerol, and lactate were measured over 48 h. We show that all three cell types have increased glucose uptake in the presence of flow; lactate release was also significantly affected. We provide robust evidence that the presence of flow significantly modifies cellular metabolism. While flow provides a more uniform nutrient distribution and increases metabolite turnover, our results indicate that different cell types have specific metabolic responses to flow, suggesting cell-specific flow-regulated activation of metabolite signalling pathways...|$|R
40|$|The reflex actions {{elicited}} by graded {{electrical stimulation}} of hind-limb cutaneous (sural, superficial peroneal and tibial) nerves were investigated with intra- and extracellular micro-electrode recordings in gamma-motoneurones projecting to hind-limb muscles in twenty-four cats anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose. In total, reflex responses of 100 gamma-motoneurones were analysed. 82 of the gamma-cells {{were classified as}} dynamic (43) or static (39) using the method of mesencephalic stimulation (Appelberg, Hulliger, Johansson & Sojka, 1982). The general responsiveness (i. e. number of input nerves with effect/number of input nerves tested) of the whole sample of gamma-cells to stimulation of skin nerves was extremely high (94. 8 %). All negative observations were encountered among static and non-classified gamma-cells. Generally, the stimulation strengths needed for evoking effects in the gamma-cells were very low. A majority of the excitatory effects in the dynamic cells appeared with stimulation intensities below 1. 5 threshold (T), while most <b>static</b> <b>cells</b> were excited with stimulation strengths between 1. 5 and 2 T. Also a statistical comparison of the populations of stimulation strength thresholds for the excitatory effects revealed a significant difference (P less than 0. 0009) between dynamic and static gamma-cells. By contrast, the thresholds for inhibitory effects in dynamic cells were slightly higher than for excitatory effects (P less than 0. 0009). As regards excitation of <b>static</b> <b>cells,</b> inhibition of dynamic cells and inhibition of <b>static</b> <b>cells,</b> no statistically significant threshold differences were found. A strong dominance of excitation over inhibition was found in both dynamic and static flexor (posterior biceps and semitendinosus) gamma-motoneurones from all input nerves. In comparison to flexor gamma-motoneurones, there was a much higher incidence of inhibitory and mixed (excitatory and inhibitory) responses in extensor (triceps) gamma-motoneurones, from all nerves tested. For dynamic cells there was an about even balance between excitation and inhibition, while for <b>static</b> <b>cells</b> inhibition seemed to prevail. The latencies for excitatory effects in dynamic gamma-cells differed from those in static gamma-cells (P less than 0. 027). The shortest latencies of excitatory effects found for dynamic gamma-cells indicate a disynaptic coupling, while for <b>static</b> <b>cells</b> the shortest route seemed to involve at least three synapses.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{have shown}} in mice and rats, enhanced leukocyte recruitment to airway postcapillary venules after excessive distention {{imposed by the}} application of positive end-expiratory pressure. Because P-selectin was shown to be essential for this outcome, we sought to establish an in vitro endothelial cell model and determine the mechanisms whereby mechanical distension alters adhesion molecule expression. P-selectin surface expression on mouse jugular vein endothelial cells exposed to cyclic stretch (5 or 20 % elongation for 5 min; Flexercell) were compared with <b>static</b> <b>cells.</b> The larger, pathophysiological regimen of cyclic stretch showed a 54 % increase in P-selectin expression after stretch compared with <b>static</b> <b>cells.</b> This response was attenuated but confirmed in tracheal venular endothelium (29 % increase). We questioned whether these changes were dependent on increases in intracellular Ca 2 + through voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels. The stretch-induced increase in P-selectin expression was substantially decreased by pretreatment with the T-type Ca 2 + channel inhibitor mibefradil (76 % inhibition). Furthermore, when the Cav 3. 1 T-type Ca 2 + channel expression was decreased in both endothelial cell subtypes with specific small-interfering RNA, the distension-induced expression of P-selectin decreased to levels less than that observed in <b>static</b> <b>cells.</b> We conclude that P-selectin expression on systemic venular endothelial cells contributes to a proinflammatory phenotype after mechanical stretch and can be selectively modulated by voltage-gated calcium channel inhibition...|$|R

We now show here that integrin � 4 tail deletion markedly impairs <b>static</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion by a mechanism that does not involve altered binding of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ligand. Instead, truncation of the � 4 cytoplasmic domain caused a severe deficiency in integrin accumulation into cell surface clusters, as induced by ligand and/ or antibodies.

Notably, low doses of cytochalasin D partially restored the deficiency in cell adhesion seen upon � 4 tail deletion.

For protection and risk assessment purposes, the influence of ‘everyday’ clothing, and skin surface decontamination on dermal chemical absorption was also assessed. The model compounds (caffeine and benzoic acid), and the surrogate compounds (chlorpyrifos, dichlorvos and phorate) were generally found to be poor marker chemicals for comparison with HD absorption through human and pig skin in vitro. However, benzoic acid absorption from a finite dose in IPA more closely matched the absorption profile of HD applied as a finite dose in IPA. Dichlorvos absorption was greatest from all vehicles compared with chlorpyrifos and HD absorption in vitro. Dermal absorption of chlorpyrifos was enhanced when applied in PG compared with absorption from IPA or IPM. No differences were observed between absorption of neat HD and HD in IPA in terms of percentage of applied dose absorbed at 24 hours. Absorption of HD through full thickness pig skin more closely matched absorption through full thickness human skin, split thickness pig skin overestimated absorption of HD in vitro in comparison. ‘Everyday’ clothing (cotton shirt) significantly reduced absorption of dichlorvos, chlorpyrifos and HD through human skin. Chemicals were applied to clothed skin in IPA to mimic finite exposure, and left in contact for 30 minutes (dichlorvos), 4 hours (chlorpyrifos), and 1 hour (HD). For all chemicals, removal of clothing followed by immediate skin surface decontamination with 0. 5 % (v/v) soap solution further reduced absorption compared with removal of clothing alone. Despite these differences not being significant, in terms or civilian exposure, it would be recommended to remove clothing and decontaminate as early as possible postexposure to minimise the potential for dermal absorption and localised toxicity within the skin. In conclusion, the organophosphate compounds used in these studies (chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos) could potentially be useful surrogates for organophosphate agents such as VX or sarin, however, further work is needed to make these comparisons. The vehicle in which a chemical is applied to the skin can {{have a profound effect on}} dermal absorption, and this knowledge is important for risk assessment for exposure to a range of chemicals. Cotton shirt material significantly reduced dermal absorption of all chemicals used compared with 24 hour exposure. Despite this clothing not being designed for protective purposes, this may have a significant impact for reducing dermal absorption and toxicity in vivo as a result of chemical exposure. Further investigation is needed to assess absorption of a wider range of chemicals and application vehicles for risk assessment purposes, and to identify chemicals that more closely mimic dermal absorption of bioactive agents in vitro for extrapolation to in vivo exposure scenariosEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{a one-year}} Department of Defense {{demonstration}} project, proton exchange membrane fuel <b>cell</b> <b>systems</b> have been installed at three residences to provide electrical power and waste heat for domestic hot water and space heating. The 5 kW-capacity fuel cells operate on reformed natural gas. These systems operate at preset levels providing power to the residence and to the utility grid. During grid outages, the residential power source is disconnected from the grid and the fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> operates in standby mode to provide power to critical loads in the residence. This paper describes lessons learned from installation and operation of these fuel <b>cell</b> <b>systems</b> in existing residences. Issues associated with installation of a fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> for {{combined heat and power}} focus primarily on fuel cell siting, plumbing external to the fuel cell unit required to support heat recovery, and line connections between the fuel cell unit and the home interior for natural gas, water, electricity, and communications. Operational considerations of the fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> are linked to heat recovery system design and conditions required for adequate flow of natural gas, air, water, and system communications. Based on actual experience with these systems in a residential setting, proper system design, component installation, and sustainment of required flows are essential for the fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> to provide reliable power and waste heat...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{recent years}} fuel cell {{vehicles}} are rapidly appearing all over the globe. In less than 10 years, {{fuel cell vehicles}} have gone from mere research novelties to operating prototypes and demonstration models. At the same time, government and industry in development countries have teamed up to invest {{billions of dollars in}} partnerships intended to commercialize fuel cell vehicles within {{the early years of the}} 21 st century. The purpose of this study is evaluation of model and performance of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle in different drive cycles. A fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> model developed in this work is a semi-experimental model that allows users to use the theory and experimental relationships in a fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system.</b> The model can be used as part of a complex fuel cell vehicle model in advanced vehicle simulator (ADVI-SOR). This work reveals that the fuel consumption and energy efficiency vary in different drive cycles. Arising acceleration and speed in a drive cycle leads to Fuel consumption increase. In addition, energy losses in drive cycle relates to fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> power request. Parasitic power in different parts of fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> will increase when power request increases. Finally, most of energy losses in drive cycle occur in fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> because of producing a lot of energy by fuel cell stack.
