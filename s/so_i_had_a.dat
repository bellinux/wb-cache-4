500|$|Beach {{maintained}} that the greatest challenge facing the crew was a seeming mundane activity, garbage disposal and cleaning: [...] "It was 84 days of strenuous work just keeping the ship clean. It was amazing how much dirt we created, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> field day every weekend. The crew started objecting until they saw how much trash we kept getting rid of. Then they couldn't object." [...] To remove trash without surfacing, Triton had a garbage disposal unit (GDU), a small inverted torpedo tube that ejected a weighted bag of refuse through {{the bottom of the}} ship. [...] However, if the GDU was temporarily out of commission due to repairs, as it was on 22 February, the after torpedo tubes were used, a less than optimum solution.|$|E
500|$|The {{album cover}} {{features}} {{a photograph of}} Dylan with Suze Rotolo. It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein {{at the corner of}} Jones Street and West 4th Street in the West Village, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: [...] "He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat." [...] In her memoir, A Freewheelin' Time, Rotolo analyzed the significance of the cover art: ...|$|E
500|$|As the {{recording}} sessions progressed, Wim Wenders approached {{the band and}} asked them for a song for his next film, Faraway, So Close!. The Edge said [...] "we heard Wim Wenders {{was looking for a}} song... <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> go at finishing it." [...] U2 watched the film, Faraway, So Close!, for inspiration on how to craft the song. Bono said [...] "the film was about angels who want to be human and who want to be on Earth. But to do so they have to become mortal. That was a great image to play with- the impossibility of wanting something like this, and then the cost of having it." [...] Two versions of the song were crafted; the first was released on Zooropa, and the second, almost two minutes longer and featuring [...] "an edgier guitar and drum performance," [...] was included on the Faraway, So Close! soundtrack. Close to the completion of {{the recording}} Bono renamed the song [...] "Stay." [...] Wanting to further reference the Wenders film he then changed it once more, to [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)".|$|E

Of course my resentment did {{not extend}} to the students, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> unforgettable good time talking to them.

2500|$|Canadian comedian Rick Miller first {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} of blending The Simpsons and Shakespeare in 1994. At the time, Miller was performing in a production of Macbeth, playing the minor role of Murderer No. 2. He said, [...] "That's a small role, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of time to sit backstage and concoct ideas, one of which was to make fun of our production. By then, The Simpsons had become a big part of pop culture, so I decided to do the voices of those cartoon characters in my mangled version of the play." [...] He performed a skit at that night's closing party, which was well received.|$|E
2500|$|After {{having done}} acting for some years, Chang went into {{directing}} theatre. She made the career change because [...] "it {{was a chance}} to work on projects that resonate deeply and personally and highlighted my world [...] of coming from a divided China that was still in the throes of revolution but steeped in culture and history. As a director, I had more autonomy in choosing projects, and felt I was contributing to American theatre with stories drawn from China's vast literary legacy. I had been acting and dancing professionally for 10 years on and off-Broadway, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> very good immersion into mainstream theatre. With directing, I can help shape what the audience experiences and walks away with." ...|$|E
2500|$|Still {{fresh off}} The Machinist, it became {{necessary}} for Bale to bulk up to match Batman's muscular physique. He {{was given a}} deadline of six months to do this. Bale recalled it had been far from a simple accomplishment: [...] "when it actually came to building muscle, I was useless. I couldn't do one push up the first day. All of the muscles were gone, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> real tough time rebuilding all of that." [...] With {{the help of a}} personal trainer, Bale succeeded in meeting the deadline, gaining a total of [...] in six months. He went from about 130lbs to 230lbs. He discovered that he had actually gained more weight than the director desired, and dropped his weight to 190lbs by the time filming began.|$|E
5000|$|Allen has on his {{shoulder}} a tattoo of Rinka the dog, owned by Norman Scott, which was shot dead during the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He has explained that: [...] "I had the tattoo placed on my arm lest <b>I</b> forget, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> history of <b>having</b> suspicions about the establishment and the government and court cases." ...|$|R

2500|$|Paul Weitz {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the story of Grandma long before he began writing the script. He never completed the story until he had met and worked with Tomlin on the 2013 film Admission, saying that [...] "After meeting Lily, the voice and the character really clicked, I had thought about it for years, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of it worked out in my head, and then I just went to a coffee shop and wrote it longhand." [...] He said that, as he wrote, he could hear her [...] "performing it in [...] head". After writing the script, he was afraid to present it to Tomlin in case she turned down the lead role. Tomlin said that she immediately connected with the character and the story; she and Weitz then spent several months editing the script together. The film marked Tomlin's first leading role in 27 years, after co-starring with Bette Midler in the 1988 comedy film Big Business.|$|E
2500|$|Medcalf has {{revealed}} to the Walford Gazette how she prepared for the role: [...] "I actually watched the show a bit when Danniella had been on <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> distinct memory of her to work with. What I basically did was to read a prepared, detailed biography of the character which {{was provided by the}} production office. I did sit down to watch a five-minute clip of Danniella but I quickly realised I didn't want to carry on watching because I was afraid of falling into doing an imitation of her, d'ye know what I mean? I'll tell you something weird-when I first started getting the scripts I used to hear the lines first in my head with HER voice saying them! But that changed over time, thank God, as I hopefully made the character my own and I gave her my voice." [...] Medcalf added that contrastingly to Westbrook, who played Sam as a young girl who was overprotected by her brothers and sheltered, she played Sam as a young woman [...] "trying to find her place both in a career and in relationships with the opposite sex." ...|$|E
2500|$|By September 1943, Disney {{assigned}} Dick Huemer and Joe Grant {{to begin}} work on Cinderella as story supervisors and given a preliminary budget of $1 million. However, by 1945, their preliminary story work was halted. During the writing stages of Song of the South, Dalton S. Reymond and Maurice Rapf entered into a personal dispute, in which Raft was reassigned to write for Cinderella. In his version, Cinderella was written to be a less passive character than Snow White, and more rebellious against her stepfamily. Raft explained, [...] "My thinking was you can't have somebody who comes in and changes everything for you. You can't be delivered it on a platter. You've got to earn it. So in my version, the Fairy Godmother said, 'It's okay till midnight but from then in it's up to you.' I made her earn it, and {{what she had to}} do achieve it was to rebel against her stepmother and stepsisters, to stop being a slave in her own home. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> scene where they're ordering her around and she throws the stuff back at them. She revolts, so they lock her up in the attic. I don't think anyone took (my idea) very seriously." ...|$|E

6000|$|If life be a war, {{it seemed}} my destiny to conduct it single-handed. I pondered now {{how to break}} up my winter-quarters--to leave an encampment where food and forage failed.

I thought she looked a bit pale and tired. She said she hadn't slept well. That accounted for it. Unless you get your eight hours, where are you? ...|$|E
