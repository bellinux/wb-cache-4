5|$|One <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{minimise}} actual motion, as when predators such as tigers stalk prey {{by moving}} very slowly and stealthily. This strategy effectively avoids {{the need to}} camouflage motion.|$|E
5|$|Predator {{avoidance}} {{may also}} explain the frequent behaviour where S.latus will carry food items {{back to a}} shelter before consuming them. When two S.latus individuals compete for a food item, they may use the enlarged second antennae to flip their opponent over, by wedging the antennae underneath the opponent's body and quickly raising them. An alternative <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> grip an opponent and begin the tail-flipping movement, or {{to engage in a}} tug of war.|$|E
5|$|When {{movement}} is required, one <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> minimise the motion signal, for example by avoiding waving limbs about and by choosing patterns {{that do not}} cause flicker when seen by the prey from straight ahead. Cuttlefish may be doing this with their active camouflage by choosing to form stripes {{at right angles to}} their front-back axis, minimising motion signals that would be given by occluding and displaying the pattern as they swim.|$|E

50|$|The {{first of}} the main {{strategies}} used to achieve high output and low fuel consumption <b>was</b> <b>to</b> improve air intake efficiency by applying the MIVEC system (valve timing & lift switching-type), and also optimizing the intake/exhaust-ports in the cylinder head, and employing a variable intake manifold. The second <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> reduce mechanical friction by using an offset crankshaft and other technologies. The third <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> improve anti-knocking performance by more efficient cooling of the cylinder head/combustion chambers. The fourth <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> adopt twin knock sensors (for sensing & control in each bank) to optimize combustion.|$|R

5|$|DNA walkers are a {{class of}} nucleic acid nanomachines that exhibit {{directional}} motion along a linear track. A large number of schemes have been demonstrated. One <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> control {{the motion of the}} walker along the track using control strands that need to be manually added in sequence. Another approach is to make use of restriction enzymes or deoxyribozymes to cleave the strands and cause the walker to move forward, which has the advantage of running autonomously. A later system could walk upon a two-dimensional surface rather than a linear track, and demonstrated the ability to selectively pick up and move molecular cargo. Additionally, a linear walker has been demonstrated that performs DNA-templated synthesis as the walker advances along the track, allowing autonomous multistep chemical synthesis directed by the walker. The synthetic DNA walkers' function {{is similar to that of}} the proteins dynein and kinesin.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bivalves}} adopt a sedentary or even sessile lifestyle, often {{spending their}} whole lives {{in the area in}} which they first settled as juveniles. The majority of bivalves are infaunal, living under the seabed, buried in soft substrates such as sand, silt, mud, gravel, or coral fragments. Many of these live in the intertidal zone where the sediment remains damp even when the tide is out. When buried in the sediment, burrowing bivalves are protected from the pounding of waves, desiccation, and overheating during low tide, and variations in salinity caused by rainwater. They are also {{out of the reach of}} many predators. Their general <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> extend their siphons to the surface for feeding and respiration during high tide, but to descend to greater depths or keep their shell tightly shut when the tide goes out. They use their muscular foot to dig into the substrate. To do this, the animal relaxes its adductor muscles and opens its shell wide to anchor itself in position while it extends its foot downwards into the substrate. Then it dilates the tip of its foot, retracts the adductor muscles to close the shell, shortens its foot and draws itself downwards. This series of actions is repeated to dig deeper.|$|E
5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} is a ground-dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the {{spotted sandgrouse}} are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant on the desert floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird. The sandgrouse <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> have one bird flying high overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E

50|$|To {{determine}} whether submissions were legitimate or fake, the team employed {{at least three}} strategies.

A second <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> check whether the IP address of the submitter matched the supposed location of the balloon. A third <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> examine photos accompanying the submission.

25|$|This can be {{attempted}} {{through several}} mechanisms.

25|$|Another <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> remove {{dendritic}} {{cells from}} the blood of a patient and activate them outside the body.

These cells (with optional adjuvants) are infused and provoke an immune response.|$|E
