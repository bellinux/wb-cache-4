The adhesion characteristics of ligament fibroblasts depend on the expression of cell surface molecules and their interaction with the ECM. Although many receptors mediating the effects of ECM components on ligament cell function remain poorly defined, it is known that fibronectin (FN) allows ligament cells to adhere through the VLA- 5 receptor (a 50 i). A direct meas-urement of the adhesion between anterior cruciate ligament {ACL) or medial col-lateral ligament (MCL) fibroblasts and fibronectin matrix proteins was achieved by using a micromanipulation technique to determine the force required to detach an A CL or MCL cell from fibronectin-coated glass. We have found that the adhesion strength is not random, but has well-defined functional relationships with the FN concentration and the <b>seeding</b> <b>time</b> (time allowed for the cell to establish attach-ment). The adhesion strength (i. e., force required to detach) of ACL cells shows a stronger dependence on FN concentration (1, 2, and 5 /ig/ml) for short <b>seeding</b> <b>times</b> (15 - 30 min) than for long <b>seeding</b> <b>times</b> (38 - 75 min). For MCL cells, the effect of the <b>seeding</b> <b>time</b> on adhesion strength was apparent for all concentrations.

The adhesion strengths of ACL and MCL fi-broblasts to FN are correlated to cell adhesion area.

Em cada época de semeadura, efetuaram-se avaliações de rendimento de grãos e altura de plantas. A disponibilidade hídrica do solo para a cultura foi caracterizada através de balanço hídrico decendial, considerando 125 mm como a capacidade máxima de retenção de água no solo. Os resultados indicaram como a melhor faixa de semeadura, independente de cultivar, o período compreendido entre o terceiro decêndio de março e o primeiro decêndio de abril. Indicaram, também, que os períodos extremos estudados são pouco favoráveis à semeadura do trigo na região. O cultivar CNT- 8 foi o mais produtivo, de maior porte de planta, independente do ano e da época de semeadura. Entre os anos em estudo, destacou-se o de 1979, cujos cultivares de trigo exibiram as maiores produções de grãos, em vista das condições climáticas favoráveis para a cultura.

If France, now unable to secure our co-operation, still thought the Italian danger grave enough to warrant single-handed intervention, how does that support the inference that she must certainly be ready to invade England next? He ridicules the conclusion that the invasion was at our doors, from such contested allegations as that the Châlons farmers refused the loan of horses from the government, because they would soon be wanted back again for the approaching war with England.

With emphasis, he insists that we have no adequate idea of the predisposing power which an immense series of measures of preparation for war on our own part, have in actually begetting war.
