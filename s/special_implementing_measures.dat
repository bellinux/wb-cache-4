40|$|AbstractA {{possible}} gastroenteritis {{outbreak in}} a hotel located in northern Majorca was reported on June 2009. The subsequent investigation revealed a total of 14 cases with onset of symptoms from 18 June to 26 June. Symptoms affected mainly the children, their parents and the staff related to the children's club; a vomiting episode was described {{at the beginning of}} the outbreak. Genotype 2 norovirus was detected in stool samples, demonstrating its role as the aetiological agent.

Work will therefore {{need to be}} undertaken locally to drive unit costs closer to the UK average. Hospitals are to be inspected by the Commission for Health Audit and Improvement (CHAI) {{and will continue to}} be allocated a star rating based on performance against an increasing range of performance assessment framework (PAF) indicators. CHAI will be given new powers to <b>implement</b> <b>special</b> <b>measures</b> if trusts do not perform at the expected level. The star rating of a trust currently affects the trust’s ability to access the NHS Performance Fund, but in the future it will also affect the size of the trust’s baseline allocation.|$|R
40|$|In The Netherlands, the {{percentage}} of struggling readers in the 1 st year of formal reading instruction is about 25 %. This problem inspired us to develop the Reading Acceleration Programme. To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} this programme, a quasi-experiment is carried out. The teachers in the experimental group have been trained to improve their core instruction, to broaden their instruction for struggling learners, and to <b>implement</b> <b>special</b> <b>measures</b> for pupils who do not respond sufficiently to these interventions. A significant difference was found on the post-tests for measuring reading of single words and reading whole sentences, after correcting for pre-test, age, intelligence, socioeconomic status, and ethnic minority. Furthermore, the programme turned out to reduce {{the percentage}} of struggling readers in the experimental group from over 28 % to less than 6 %. In the follow-up study, the overall effects remained to a moderate degree...|$|R
40|$|International {{legislation}} forms {{a cornerstone}} of conservation, yet its efficacy is rarely quantified. We assess whether species listed on Annex I of the European Union (EU) Birds Directive, for which EU Member States are obliged to <b>implement</b> <b>special</b> conservation <b>measures,</b> differ systematically in their short-term (2001 - 2012) or long-term (1980 - 2012) population trends from those of non-Annex I species. In both periods, Annex I species had more positive trends than non-Annex I species, particularly in countries that joined the EU earlier. There were additional signatures of climate change and life history strategy in the trends of species in one or both periods. Within Annex I species, long-distance migrants fared significantly worse than other species, suggesting that enhanced protection on the breeding grounds alone may be insufficient for these species. We conclude that the EU's conservation legislation has had a demonstrably positive impact on target species, even during {{a period in which}} climate change has significantly affected populations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Maintenance and {{construction}} programs are arguably {{one of the}} most important functions of states’ DOT (as represented by the percentage of the budget invested). On the other hand, during the construction period, there are temporarily traffic disruptions, which increase the number of accidents with associated deaths and injuring thousands of people every year. Therefore, several states have taken a proactive role in <b>implementing</b> <b>special</b> <b>measures</b> in construction work zones to reduce the number of accidents. One of these special measurements is the increase of law enforcement surveillance in construction zones. This paper presents a series of assessments done nationwide to measure the impact of law enforcement in construction zones. The content of this paper was then used as the foundation to establish a method to determine the impact of a law enforcement surveillance increase in Mississippi. This work followed a descriptive research methodology with meta-analysis based on a systematic literature review performed in the databases of several organizations. The results presented in this paper could be used as the foundation for similar studies in other states, and they have the potential to directly benefit construction education by serving as an example of good practice in engineering education...|$|R
40|$|On January 5, 1990 the Lower Saxonian {{government}} decided {{to set up}} a continuous soil monitoring programme. The idea of establishing a monitoring system for the environmental medium of soil is to have a means of early risk prediction as part of the basis that is needed for the sustentation of human existence. The decision was based on a resolution by the Lower Saxonian Government on June 25, 1985 to improve the information base for soil protection by establishing a soil cadastre, <b>implementing</b> <b>special</b> <b>measures</b> for problem areas, and setting up trial plots. In accordance with this decision the Lower Saxonian State Office for Soil Research (NLfB) has since 1985 been developing the Lower Saxonian Soil Information System NIBIS which contains an extensive body of digitally stored data on the distribution and properties of soils. Another measure to this end was the establishment of plots for continuous soil monitoring (BDF) to permit the long-term observation of influences on soil with respect to pollution and specific soil uses. This is an important prerequisite for developing preventive measures.

The collection of information from the agencies followed a descriptive research methodology. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the importance of inter-agency collaboration. Furthermore, this paper provide an example of data collected, archiving mechanism and retrieval procedures of each agency involved in this project.
