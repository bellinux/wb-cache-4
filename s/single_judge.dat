5|$|Section 4 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 had {{provided}} that two judges or justices {{would constitute a}} quorum. The practice of sending a single circuit rider was explicitly authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1793, but was already common before 1793. Under the Judicial Act of 1802, a <b>single</b> <b>judge</b> (either the district judge or the circuit rider) could preside alone.|$|E
5|$|Bamber first sought {{leave to}} appeal in November 1986, arguing that the judge had {{misdirected}} the jury. The application was heard and refused by a <b>single</b> <b>judge</b> in April 1988. Bamber's lawyer requested a full hearing before three judges, arguing that the trial judge's summing up had been biased against Bamber, that his language had been too forceful, {{and that he had}} undermined the defence by advancing his own theory. The lawyer also argued that the defence had not pressed Julie Mugford about her dealings with the media, but should have, because as soon as the trial was over her story began to appear in newspapers. The judges rejected the application in March 1989.|$|E
5|$|Tracing its {{heritage}} to 1841 when Oregon pioneers {{selected a}} Supreme Judge with probate powers, {{the court has}} grown from a <b>single</b> <b>judge</b> to its current make up of seven justices. Justices of the court serve six-year terms upon election, however vacancies are filled by appointments of the Governor of Oregon until the next general election when any qualified candidate may run for the position, including the appointee. These seven justices then select one member to serve a six-year term as Chief Justice. The court’s Chief Justice is not only responsible for assigning cases to the other justices to write the court’s opinions, but is also {{the chief executive of the}} Oregon Judicial Department.|$|E

25|$|The Catholic Church {{developed}} the inquisitorial {{system in the}} Middle Ages. This judicial system features collegiate panels of judges and an investigative form of proceeding, in contradistinction to the adversarial system found in the common law of England and many of her former colonies, which utilises concepts such as juries and <b>single</b> <b>judges.</b>|$|R
5|$|Since {{there were}} no sitting justices at the {{beginning}} of Washington's term, he had the unique opportunity to fill the entire body of United States federal judges with his selections. Despite this, Washington appointed only 28 judges to the United States district courts, due to the smaller size of the judiciary at the time; there were far fewer states, most states had a single district court, and each district had a <b>single</b> <b>judge</b> assigned to it. Because intermediate federal appellate courts had not yet been established, this, combined with the Supreme Court appointments, constituted the total number of federal judicial appointments made by Washington. The number is roughly 10% of the record 376 judges appointed by Ronald Reagan from 1980 to 1988, when the judiciary was much larger, and less than 5% of the number of active federal judges serving as of July 2010. Richard Peters, Jr. served for over 36 years, the longest of Washington's appointments.|$|E
5|$|Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, the United States circuit {{courts were}} {{composed}} of a stationary United States district court judge and any two Supreme Court justices riding circuit. If one judge or justice disagreed with the other two, the majority prevailed. If only one Supreme Court justice could attend (as was authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1793), and a division arose between the district judge and the Supreme Court justice, the practice was to hold the case over until the next term. If a one-to-one division persisted with a different circuit riding justice, {{the opinion of the}} previous circuit rider broke the tie. Following a brief intermezzo with the soon-repealed Midnight Judges Act of 1801 (which briefly abolished circuit riding), under the Judiciary Act of 1802, the circuit courts were {{composed of a}} stationary district judge and one Supreme Court justice assigned to the circuit. But, a <b>single</b> <b>judge</b> (either the district judge or the circuit rider) could preside alone. In cases where both judges sat, though, one-to-one divisions {{were less likely to be}} resolved by continuing the case until the next term because the circuit riding justice would be the same (barring a change in membership on the Court).|$|E
25|$|A <b>single</b> <b>judge</b> hears {{and decides}} cases in {{ordinary}} and summary proceedings {{as well as}} in small claims cases. A panel of three judges decides cases of great importance in ordinary proceedings as well as appeals or interlocutory appeals from the summary and small claims proceedings. Criminal cases are decided by a panel of three judges, with the exception of summary proceedings which may be held by a <b>single</b> <b>judge.</b> The Juvenile Court hears and decides only cases involving juveniles.|$|E
50|$|Placing of dancersFor Individual dance competitions, placing {{is based}} entirely on a <b>single</b> <b>judges</b> {{subjective}} opinion.

For instance, a tie at 2nd place {{would result in the}} 4th best dancer receiving 3rd place (1st, 2nd, 2nd, 3rd, instead of 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 4th).|$|R
50|$|Judges are {{selected}} through competitive examinations, while honorary judges {{for all the}} functions performed by <b>single</b> <b>judges</b> can be appointed also by election.

5000|$|Much of the {{legislative}} style was adapted from the Roman Law Code of Justinian. As a result, Roman ecclesiastical courts tend to follow the Roman Law style of continental Europe with some variation, featuring collegiate panels of judges and an investigative form of proceeding, called [...] "inquisitorial", from the Latin [...] "inquirere", to enquire. This {{is in contrast to}} the adversarial form of proceeding found in the common law system of English and U.S. law, which features such things as juries and <b>single</b> <b>judges.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Appeals Court usually hears {{cases in}} three-judge panels, which rotate {{so that every}} judge has an {{opportunity}} to sit with every other <b>judge.</b> However, <b>single</b> <b>judges</b> will often hear interlocutory appeals concerning such issues as court orders, stays of civil proceedings, and awards of attorney's fees. The Appeals Court consists of twenty-five active justices as well as several recall justices who despite having retired continue to assist the Court with its case load. Appeals are heard from September through June at the John Adams Courthouse as well as at special sessions held at various locations such as law schools throughout Massachusetts.|$|R
50|$|Three judges usually {{form the}} panel for appeals, {{although}} five judges {{can be used}} for significant legal issues. The Chief Justice has ultimate discretion in determining the number of judges to sit on the Bench, and the selection of individual judges for each case. A unanimous decision is not needed as the majority view will prevail. Judges are selected from the Chief Justice in complex matters, the President of the Court of Appeal, the Judges of Appeal, the Chief Judge as well as other nominated judges of the Common Law Division. <b>Single</b> <b>judges</b> hear sentence appeals from the Drug Court.|$|R

25|$|In {{the final}} points, the Court {{found that a}} {{judicial}} review of the type brought by the Government against the railroads did not require a three-judge panel to make a ruling; rather, a <b>single</b> <b>judge</b> was the most appropriate course.

5|$|Similarly, {{different}} court systems existed. In Nejd, {{there was}} a simple system of <b>single</b> <b>judges</b> {{for each of the}} major towns.

In 1925, Abdul Aziz Al Saud of Nejd conquered the Hejaz and united it with his existing territories to form the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. In 1927, the king introduced a new court system to the Hejaz comprising general and summary courts and ordered that Hanbali fiqh should be used. However, Nejd's traditional system of judges was left in place in the face of conservative opposition from the Nejd religious establishment.|$|R
50|$|The court hears {{very serious}} {{cases such as}} murder and treason, civil cases {{involving}} more than $750 000, and civil matters such as wills, injunctions, and admiralty.

The court includes the Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal which hear appeals from the District Court and the Local Court and from <b>single</b> <b>judges</b> sitting in the Common Law or Equity Divisions.
