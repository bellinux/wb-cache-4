40|$|Radar {{data quality}} {{control is a}} major {{component}} to the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Ground Validation (GV) effort. The quality control algorithm utilizes several adjustable height and reflectivity threshold parameters to remove non-precipitation echoes from ground-based radar data. Spurious radar reflectivity returns not removed during the quality control process may create biases in ground validation rainfall products used to evaluate rainfall measurements retrieved from aboard the TRMM satellite. To better evaluate {{the performance of the}} quality control algorithm, WSR- 88 D radar data from one primary GV site, Melbourne, Florida, are used to determine the seasonal characteristics of non-meteorological radar echoes in cast central Florida {{during the first year of}} the TRMM mission. It is demonstrated that unique <b>spurious</b> <b>echo</b> regimes develop throughout the year, leading to different levels of successful non-meteorological echo removal by the quality control algorithm. In addition to the type of non- precipitation echoes present, the success of the algorithm is also greatly dependent upon the amount of precipitation present. Less aggressive attempts to remove non-meteorological echoes must be employed when rain is observed so as not to remove these echoes as well. Therefore, precipitation statistics from ground validation monthly rainfall products will be utilized to further document the quality control algorithm performance. Moreover, these precipitation statistics will be used to demonstrate the relationship between dominant <b>spurious</b> <b>echo</b> regimes and rainfall amount. Finally, monthly statistics of contaminated ground validation radar data will be calculated and the effect on rainfall accumulation products will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|When {{performing}} {{magnetic resonance}} (MR) experiments, a strong {{homogeneous magnetic field}} is often preferred, especially in clinical applications. However, all objects that are placed in the magnetic field will disturb the field homogeneity and cause local magnetic field gradients. In the human body, which consists {{of a large number}} of tissues and organs of different shape and susceptibility (the ability to become magnetised), the field distribution becomes very complex. To minimise magnetic field inhomogeneities in the studied region, shim gradients, of linear or higher order, are locally optimised for each measurement. In clinical MR the trend is towards higher field strengths, from 1. 5 T to 3 T and beyond, and this leads to increased susceptibility effects, both in MR imaging (MRI) and MR spectroscopy (MRS). To have control of the susceptibility effects, and achieve high accuracy in phantom studies, it is valuable to have an easy and accessible method for measuring the susceptibility value of the phantom materials. A method which utilises MRI for susceptibility measurements was significantly improved by using an echo planar imaging sequence instead of the standard implementation of a spin echo sequence. An increased sensitivity and accuracy provides a possibility to detect smaller susceptibility differences, to be more flexible in choice of reference liquid or to decrease the sample volume. An automated evaluation method based on model fitting was also developed and this increased the accuracy even further. Finally, the volume susceptibility of two plastics, commonly used in phantoms, was determined. For small volume 1 H MRS in susceptibility influenced regions, the <b>spurious</b> <b>echo</b> artifact has become a problem. It is, however, seldom recognised as a susceptibility artifact. In this thesis a k-space description was introduced and the causes and conditions of this artifact were studied. When the shim gradients are optimised for a small volume, the possibility of achieving a good local shim, i. e. a locally homogenous magnetic field, is increased. An imaging technique was developed, the WSI-scan (water suppression imaging), which visualises how the global effects of the locally optimised shim might shift the water resonance in some regions outside the water suppression bandwidth. When regions of unsuppressed water overlap with the excitation regions of the volume selection, the probability of a <b>spurious</b> <b>echo</b> artifact increases significantly. To destroy any outer volume signal strong spoiling gradients are implemented in the volume selection sequences. By using the new modified k-space concept it was possible to demonstrate all magnetic configurations and their relative positions prior to acquisition in one single k-space map. This tool showed to be powerful not only for describing the artifact formation but also for evaluating the effective spoiling of unwanted magnetic configurations and it was applied to two volume selection methods, PRESS (point resolved spectroscopy) and STEAM (stimulated echo acquisition mode). The k-space description was verified by in vitro experiments where the magnetic configurations of PRESS were separately refocused into <b>spurious</b> <b>echo</b> artifacts. This thesis shows that shim gradients are not only likely to shift water resonances of the brain outside the water suppression band, they might also refocus unwanted, and spoiled, magnetic configurations into a <b>spurious</b> <b>echo.</b> The k-space concept, the WSI-scan and the susceptibility measurements all provide important tools for evaluating strategies and prerequisites for high quality 1 H MRS of small volumes...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{function}} of the TRMM Ground Validation (GV) Program is to create GV rainfall products that provide basic validation of satellite-derived precipitation measurements for select primary sites. A fundamental and extremely important step in creating high-quality GV products is radar data quality control. Quality control (QC) processing of TRMM GV radar data is based on some automated procedures, but the current QC algorithm is not fully operational and requires significant human interaction to assure satisfactory results. Moreover, the TRMM GV QC algorithm, even with continuous manual tuning, still can not completely remove all types of spurious echoes. In an attempt to improve the current operational radar data QC procedures of the TRMM GV effort, an intercomparison of several QC algorithms has been conducted. This presentation will demonstrate how various radar data QC algorithms affect accumulated radar rainfall products. In all, six different QC algorithms will be applied to two months of WSR- 88 D radar data from Melbourne, Florida. Daily, five-day, and monthly accumulated radar rainfall maps will be produced for each quality-controlled data set. The QC algorithms will be evaluated and compared based {{on their ability to}} remove spurious echoes without removing significant precipitation. Strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm will be assessed based on, their abilit to mitigate both erroneous additions and reductions in rainfall accumulation from <b>spurious</b> <b>echo</b> contamination and true precipitation removal, respectively. Contamination from individual <b>spurious</b> <b>echo</b> categories will be quantified to further diagnose the abilities of each radar QC algorithm. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis will be conducted to determine if a more automated QC algorithm is a viable alternative to the current, labor-intensive QC algorithm employed by TRMM GV...|$|E

40|$|The Poker Flat MST (mesosphere {{stratosphere}} troposphere) radar {{has operated}} from early 1979 to 1985. The data recorded {{during that time}} resides on some 1100 magnetic tapes. A second set containing only the derived parameters of velocity, width and signal to noise of the primary echo at each height, plus the noise spectra, occupies another 250 tapes. While processing to generate the compressed data set does correct some known errors, no attempt {{has been made to}} identify or remove <b>spurious</b> <b>echoes.</b> Because the Poker Flat data set is such a unique and valuable resource, a proposal is made to archive the data in forms more useful for analysis. The archived data set would contain only the parameters for significant echoes with contamination from airplanes, unwanted ionospheric returns, frequently aliased Doppler signals and other sources removed. The archived set should be as good or better than the example shown and may occupy only 25 to 50 tapes...|$|R
40|$|The anisotropic, {{heterogeneous}} and coarse granular {{structures of}} {{austenitic stainless steel}} welds may lead to important disturbances of the ultrasonic propagation: beam skewing and splitting, attenuation, backscattering and <b>spurious</b> <b>echoes.</b> Numerous studies were undertaken by EDF R&D and CEA {{for a few years}} to study these disturbances and to improve the ultrasonic NDT in nuclear applications. This paper presents a laboratory study on the ultrasonic examination of the branch pipe weld connecting the Chemical and Volume Control System (CVCS) and the primary coolant piping of PWR circuits. Both experimental and theoretical approaches are used in this work, which helped to set up the methodology for modelling ultrasonic inspection of an austenitic stainless steel weld, presented in this conference [1]. Two theoretical approaches are presented: a FEM code, ATHENA, developed by EDF, and a semi-analytical code integrated in the CIVA simulation platform, developed by CEA. These codes simulate the propagation of the ultrasonic beam in the weld and calculate the defect/beam interaction. Experimental tests are performed on a plane mock-up representative of a CVCS weld in terms of material and welding process. The geometrical effect is not studied here.

40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{computer simulation}} technologies which are indispensable forperformance improvement of ultrasonic testing systems. In Chapter 1, {{the importance of}} ultrasonic nondestructive testing is described, and therequirements for simulation technology are presented. In Chapter 2, a new measurement method for ultrasonic velocity using a pair of tone burstsof distinct frequencies is described. Round trip delay is determined {{on the basis of}} the phasesand envelopes of the returned echoes. Phase uncertainty in multiples of 2 is removed usingthe frequency difference. The usefulness of the method is verified by experiments. Also, theinfluence of the surface roughness of the test object on the echo height is discussed using anequivalent circuit. Calculations are given for a broadband and a narrow-band transducer. It isshown that the variation of the echo height due to surface roughness depends on thecharacteristics of the transducers. In Chapter 3, a simple simulation model for estimating echoes from a planar flaw existingnear the bottom surface of the test object is presented and is shown to be useful for the anglebeam technique. An expression for echoes is derived, and the results calculated with theexpression are in a good agreement with echoes observed in experiments. It is demonstratedthat echo waveforms depend on the inclination angle of the planar flaw. Next, a similar simulation method is proposed for estimating echoes in an automatictesting system for a round bar. On the bases of the Rayleigh integral and geometrical opticsapproximation, an expression for a <b>spurious</b> <b>echo</b> as well as an expression for a flaw echo isderived. A new probe design is given based on the optimization of the ratio of the flaw echoheight to the <b>spurious</b> <b>echo</b> height. The new probe exhibits an improvement of about 10 dB inthe ratio, which is in a good agreement with the simulation results. In Chapter 4, simulation techniques for estimating ultrasonic fields in the test object arepresented when the angle beam technique is used. The technique is based on the elasticFDTD (finite difference time domain) method. An angle beam transducer model and two setsof boundary conditions around a flaw are considered, and the validity of the technique isverified by experiments. A simple model for the absorbing boundary is also presented. Usingthe models, we found that a SV (shear vertical) wave is generated which propagates along thesurface of the test object. The wave is useful for measuring shear wave velocity. In Chapter 5, a hybrid simulation technique is presented for estimating echoes andultrasonic fields in the test object. The use of this hybrid technique reduces the computationaltime and computer memory. In this technique, the fields generated by the transducer arecalculated by the method of the Rayleigh integral, and fields scattered around the flaw arecalculated by the FDTD method. The received echo signals are expressed as the innerproduct of the transmitted and scattered field vectors. The validity of the technique is verifiedby experiments. In Conclusions, this study on simulation technology is summarized, and further works tobe done are described. 電気通信大学 200...|$|E

40|$|Echocardiographic and phonocardiographic {{records of}} 19 {{patients}} with a normally functioning Cooley-Cutter mitral valve were analyzed {{in order to provide}} quantitative baseline values for this prosthesis. The average duration between the second heart sound and peak opening of the valve (A 2 -OC interval) was 83 ± 4 (standard error of the mean) msec. The Q-CC interval (from the electrocardiographic Q wave to closure of the valve) was 71 ± 2 msec. Mean opening and closing velocities of the disc were similar (396 ± 11 mm/sec and 393 ± 12 mm/sec, respectively). Amplitude of disc excursion ranged from 6 to 9 mm, but this measurement was not possible in all patients due to the presence of <b>spurious</b> <b>echoes.</b> Early onset of prosthetic valve closure was a relatively common finding in {{patients with a}}trial fibrillation or with various forms of atrioventricular block, and frequently resulted in a variety of phonocardiographic alterations. Except for the A 2 -OC interval and amplitude of disc excursion, there was no significant correlation between valve size and echo-phonocardiographic measurements. Results of this study are compared with values previously reported for other types of caged disc valves, and the usefulness and limitations of echo-phonocardiographic assessment of prosthetic valve function are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Water Column imaging, using hydrographic-grade multibeam echo {{sounders}} is {{now available}} commercially. Such a capability was originally developed primarily for fisheries imaging, but provides significant advantages for hydrographic data quality control. Most immediately apparent {{is the ability to}} view the near 2 -D scattering field around wrecks or other man-made objects. Robust bottom tracking algorithms have to be optimized for likely seabed geometry. To avoid excessive outlier density, mistracking on <b>spurious</b> <b>echoes</b> is often discouraged by the use of gating or neighbour-proximity rules. Such methods, however, can fail spectacularly on abrupt non-continuous surfaces, commonly found over submerged man-made structures like wrecks or oil and gas infrastructure. These structures are often unsuspected and imaged only in a random pass of a regular survey. Based on prior experience, the least depth determination is often questionable from the real-time bottom tracking solutions. The main submerged superstructure is usually apparent but concern over protruding features can result in the need for bar or wire sweep investigations. Nevertheless, if the complete water-column trace from each beam is retained it is possible to review the full volume of scattering targets {{in the vicinity of the}} suspected object during post-mission feature examination. The interpretation of such imagery is prone to error unless the operator fully comprehends the imaging geometry. Particularly significant is the role of sidelobe echoes, both from the transmit and receive beams, producing secondary, ghost-like targets in the vicinity of point scattering features, such as masts or abrupt hull forms. This paper will review the imaging geometry and resulting scattering field that would be produced by such targets. Real examples of wrecks, imaged using EM 3002 and EM 710 sonars, are presented as case studies...|$|R
40|$|Background: MRI physics {{simulators}} {{have been}} developed {{in the past for}} optimizing imaging protocols and for training purposes. However, these simulators have only addressed motion within a limited scope. The {{purpose of this study was}} the incorporation of realistic motion, such as cardiac motion, respiratory motion and flow, within MRI simulations in a high performance multi-GPU environment. Methods: Three different motion models were introduced in the Magnetic Resonance Imaging SIMULator (MRISIMUL) of this study: cardiac motion, respiratory motion and flow. Simulation of a simple Gradient Echo pulse sequence and a CINE pulse sequence on the corresponding anatomical model was performed. Myocardial tagging was also investigated. In pulse sequence design, software crushers were introduced to accommodate the long execution times in order to avoid <b>spurious</b> <b>echoes</b> formation. The displacement of the anatomical model isochromats was calculated within the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) kernel for every timestep of the pulse sequence. Experiments that would allow simulation of custom anatomical and motion models were also performed. Last, simulations of motion with MRISIMUL on single-node and multi-node multi-GPU systems were examined. Results: Gradient Echo and CINE images of the three motion models were produced and motion-related artifacts were demonstrated. The temporal evolution of the contractility of the heart was presented through the application of myocardial tagging. Better simulation performance and image quality were presented through the introduction of software crushers without the need to further increase the computational load and GPU resources. Last, MRISIMUL demonstrated an almost linear scalable performance with the increasing number of available GPU cards, in both single-node and multi-node multi-GPU computer systems. Conclusions: MRISIMUL is the first MR physics simulator to have implemented motion with a 3 D large computational load on a single computer multi-GPU configuration. The incorporation of realistic motion models, such as cardiac motion, respiratory motion and flow may benefit the design and optimization of existing or new MR pulse sequences, protocols and algorithms, which examine motion related MR applications...|$|R
40|$|Weather radars {{have been}} used to quantitatively {{estimate}} precipitation since their development in the 1940 s, yet these estimates are still prone to large uncertainties which dissuade the hydrological community in the UK from adopting these estimates as their primary rainfall data source. Recently dual polarisation radars have become more common, with the national networks in the USA, UK and across Europe being upgraded, and the benefits of dual polarisation radars are beginning to be realised for improving quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE). The National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) mobile Doppler X-band dual polarisation weather radar is the first radar {{of its kind in the}} UK, and since its acquisition in 2012 has been deployed on several field campaigns in both the UK and abroad. The first of these campaigns was the Convective Precipitation Experiment (COPE) where the radar was deployed in Cornwall (UK) through the summer of 2013. This thesis has used the data acquired during the COPE field campaign to develop a processing chain for the X-band radar which leverages its dual polarisation capabilities. The processing chain developed includes the removal of <b>spurious</b> <b>echoes</b> including second trip, ground clutter and insects through the use of dual polarisation texture fields, logical decision thresholds and fuzzy logic classification. The radar data is then corrected for the effects of attenuation and partial beam blockage (PBB) by using the differential phase shift to constrain the total path integrated attenuation and calibrate the radar azimuthally. A new smoothing technique has been developed to account for backscatter differential phase in the smoothing of differential phase shift which incorporates a long and a short averaging window in conjunction with weighting smoothing using the copolar correlation coefficient. During the correction process it is shown that the calculation of PBB is insensitive to the variation in the ratio between specific attenuation and specific differential phase shift provided a consistent value is used. It is also shown that the uncertainty in attenuation correction is lower when using a constrained correction such as the ZPHI approach rather than a direct linear correction using differential phase shift and is the preferred method of correction where possible. Finally the quality controlled, corrected radar moments are used to develop a rainfall estimation for the COPE field campaign. Results show that the quality control and correction process increases the agreement between radar rainfall estimates and rain gauges when using horizontal reflectivity from a regression correlation of - 0. 01 to 0. 34, with a reduction in the mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD) from 86...|$|R
