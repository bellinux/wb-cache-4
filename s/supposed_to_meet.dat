Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the showcase, all five members delayed signing contracts on the legal advice from, amongst others, Victoria Beckham's father, Anthony Adams. In March 1995, because of the group's frustration at their management's unwillingness {{to listen to their}} visions and ideas, they parted from Heart Management. In order to ensure they kept control of their own work, the group retrieved the master recordings of their discography from the management offices.

5|$|Initially overjoyed at the {{prospect}} of marrying, Marguerite Louise's ebullience faded to dismay when she discovered her half-sister, despite initially favouring the Tuscan match, then changed her mind. In reaction, Marguerite Louise's behaviour became erratic: she shocked the court by going out unaccompanied, a grievous offence in contemporary French society, with her cousin Prince Charles of Lorraine, who soon became her lover. Her marriage by proxy, on 19 April 1661, did nothing to change her attitude, much to the annoyance of Louis XIV's ministers. On the day she was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> diplomats offering their congratulations on the wedding, she attempted to abscond and go hunting, only to be stopped by the Duchess of Montpensier.|$|E

In Weert, Captain Mayhew was {{assisted}} by local resistance fighters. To locate German positions they often had to expose themselves to enemy fire, which resulted in several injuries among the company. On 16 October 1944, during the Battle of Overloon, Mayhew was injured by shells while creating bridges for tanks across a stream at Venray. He was sent to a hospital in Brussels, but returned to his company, against the orders of his doctors, in fear that his command might be given away to someone else. On 25 February 1945 he was again injured while advancing towards the Rhine, and was evacuated back to the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Fénix was {{stationed}} in Cádiz in January 1762 {{and spent the next}} two years serving in the Mediterranean Sea, the Straits of Gibraltar, and the Atlantic Ocean. Fénix underwent several large repairs at the Arsenal de la Carraca between 1764 and 1765, where she remained stripped of her armament until 1769, under the command of Francisco Cotiella. In 1778 Fénix was recommissioned under Captain Félix Ignacio deTejada, who was superseded by Captain Francisco Javier deMelgarejo y Rojas when Spain entered the American Revolutionary War in June 1779. Fénix immediately set sail for the English Channel, part of the fleet under Lieutenant General Luis de Córdova y Córdova, which was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> a French fleet at the Sisgaras Islands, off the northern coast of Spain. This Franco-Spanish Armada of 1779 of more than 60 ships-of-the-line was to escort an invasion force of 40,000 troops across the Channel in a bid to capture the British naval base at Portsmouth. Córdova's ships were delayed by contrary winds, which forced them to keep close to the coast of Portugal. In consequence they did not arrive at the rendezvous until 22July, by which time the French, short of supplies, had left. Although the two fleets would eventually unite, Fénix left for the Azores on 23July with a squadron under Lieutenant General Antonio de Ulloa, to protect the Spanish anchorage and to face a British force of which the Spanish had received news.|$|E

25|$|In the 1919 Cost Accounting Nicholson and Rohrbach again {{deal with}} the admittedly {{controversial}} {{question as to whether}} it is proper to treat normal interest return on passive investment as a part of manufacturing costs, the position is taken that interest on fixed assets should be so charged, but not interest on floating capital investment. The charging of some interest item is considered necessary to the successful distribution of overhead. Or, more exactly, normal return on passive investment is regarded as overhead to be distributed among the factory products. The authors in chapter IV considers that the opposition argument is directed chiefly at the practice of making these charges as part of the regular costs, not at the mere calculation thereof for use in statistical report form in the quotation of prices. He therefore suggests (p.140) an accounting procedure <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> this objection.|$|E

In addition, this study also examine the differences of long-lived assets impairment in predicting firm’s future cash flows between countries with common law legal system and civil law legal system in ASEAN. Accounting for long-lived assets impairment is regulated by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the International Accounting Standards (IAS) No. 36 Impairment of Assets. Information of longlived assets impairment <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meets</b> the fundamental qualitative characteristics such as relevance. One of the relevance criteria is predictive value. Therefore, information of long-lived assets impairment <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have predictive value. The population in this research is manufacturing firms which have been listed on the stock exchange in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand in 2012 - 2014. Ten firms which report long-lived assets impairment in each country are taken as sample, resulting in total companies selected are 40 firms or 120 observations. The analytical tools that used in this research are multiple regression analysis and chow test. The results show that long-lived assets impairment has a significant and negative effect on future operating cash flows. In other words, long-lived assets impairment has predictive ability to future operating cash flows. This finding suggest that after tested empirically, information of long-lived assets impairment which stipulated in IAS 36 is consistent with fundamental qualitative characteristic, i. e., relevance. However, the ability of long-lived assets impairment in predicting firm’s future operating cash flows between common law legal system and civil law legal system in ASEAN countries is the same...|$|R

Thales has said that water is the source of everything. Anaximander would not agree to this, for he thought that all had come from space. Anaximenes had affirmed that it was air. Anaxagoras had remarked that matter was infinite. Xenophanes had declared that everything was one whole, and that it was a god, everlasting, eternal, never born and never dying, but round in his shape! Parmenides thought that it was fire that moved the earth. Leucippus believed it to be [...] "plenum et inane." [...] What [...] "full and empty" [...] may mean I cannot tell; but Democritus could, for he believed in it--though in other matters he went a little farther! Empedocles sticks to the old four elements. Heraclitus is all for fire. Melissus imagines that whatever exists is infinite and immutable, and ever has been and ever will be. Plato thinks that the world has always existed, while the Pythagoreans attribute everything to mathematics.[279] [...] "Your wise man," [...] continues Cicero, [...] "will know one whom to choose out of all these.
