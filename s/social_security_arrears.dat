30|$|Under {{the current}} system, <b>social</b> <b>security</b> funds and <b>social</b> <b>security</b> fees {{are the two}} main sources of revenue for <b>social</b> <b>security</b> causes, and I believe that this system should be {{replaced}} by the system of <b>social</b> <b>security</b> tax. <b>Social</b> <b>security</b> tax is compulsive as compared with <b>social</b> <b>security</b> fee, it guarantees a more stable revenue, and its greater coverage allows for a larger scale of revenue. <b>Social</b> <b>security</b> funds are close to commercial security, because principal and interest in personal accounts belong to individuals, and thus, losing the ability to coordinate the society’s needs as a whole. <b>Social</b> <b>security</b> tax is fiscal and governments may use <b>social</b> <b>security</b> tax revenue for coordination.

40|$|With {{the dawn}} of democracy, the South African <b>social</b> <b>security</b> system was {{in dire need of}} change. The right of access to <b>social</b> <b>security</b> was for the first time entrenched as a {{fundamental}} right in the 1995 Constitution. Since then, many changes have been effected to the present formal <b>social</b> <b>security</b> system, but these were mostly ad hoc and lacked a comprehensive approach. The past history of the country led to the exclusion {{of the majority of the}} population from formal <b>social</b> <b>security</b> protection. The excluded and marginalised had to rely on informal <b>social</b> <b>security</b> measures to provide social protection. This resulted in a system of co-existence between formal and informal <b>social</b> <b>security.</b> Although informal <b>social</b> <b>security</b> is increasingly recognised as part of the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> landscape, the role and importance of informal <b>social</b> <b>security</b> have largely been ignored in all reforms to improve the protective scope of the present <b>social</b> <b>security</b> system. The thesis aims to change this. Informal <b>social</b> <b>security</b> has been denied a rightful place in the South African <b>social</b> <b>security</b> landscape. The thesis recommends a model as to how the divide between formal and informal <b>social</b> <b>security</b> can be bridged. This model will, it is hoped, serve as a baseline for stimulating debate and generating new innovative ideas as to how to improve the present <b>social</b> <b>security</b> system in South Africa.

40|$|Although not {{characterized}} as {{a program designed to}} address the problems of poverty, <b>Social</b> <b>Security,</b> the linchpin of Americaâ€™s social welfare enterprise, impacts poverty more significantly than most of the usually identified anti-poverty programs. For examples, more children receive <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> benefits than those on welfare, and <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> payments are modified to provide low income earners with proportionately higher benefits than their higher earning counterparts. Affirming the validity of <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> the recent National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform represents a changed environment for <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> policy development, and it has proposed several <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> initiatives that would expand its reach more deeply into the jungle of poverty. Recognizing the limitations of existing social welfare anti-poverty programs, collapsing the cash assistance functions of these programs into <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> would contribute significantly to reducing poverty in the United States. Such an endeavor, however, would not only require a realignment of Americaâ€™s social welfare programs, but would increase the fiscal burdens born by <b>Social</b> <b>Security.</b> Such proposals could reduce the poverty rate by 3 percent or more, but they also call further attention to the failure of the payroll tax to sustain not only current <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> commitments, let alone satisfy any further obligations <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> might assume by virtue of its expanded role.
