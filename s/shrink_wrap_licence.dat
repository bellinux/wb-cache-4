40|$|The {{effects of}} {{packaging}} treatments, post harvest cooling delay and storage duration on color, texture, ascorbic acid content, {{weight loss and}} glucosinolate retention in crown-cut heads of broccoli were studied. Oxygen and CO 2 levels inside <b>shrink</b> <b>wrap</b> packages were also monitored. <b>Shrink</b> <b>wrap</b> packaging had a significant positive effect on hue angle (p 0. 05).
