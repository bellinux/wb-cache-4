50|$|Tire Uniformity {{refers to}} the dynamic {{mechanical}} properties of pneumatic tires as strictly defined {{by a set of}} measurement standards and test conditions accepted by global tire and car makers. These measurement standards include the parameters of radial force variation, lateral force variation, conicity, plysteer, radial run-out, lateral run-out, and <b>sidewall</b> <b>bulge.</b> Tire makers worldwide employ tire uniformity measurement as a way to identify poorly performing tires so they are not sold to the marketplace. Both tire and vehicle manufacturers seek to improve tire uniformity in order to improve vehicle ride comfort.|$|E
50|$|Given {{that the}} tire is an {{assembly}} of multiple components that are cured in a mold, {{there are many}} process variations that cause cured tires to be classified as rejects. Bulges and depressions in the sidewall are such defects. A bulge is a weak spot in the sidewall that expands when the tire is inflated. A depression is a strong spot that does not expand in equal measure as the surrounding area. Both are deemed visual defects. Tires are measured in production to identify those with excessive visual defects. Bulges may also indicate defective construction conditions such as missing cords, which pose a safety hazard. As a result, tire makers impose stringent inspection standards to identify tires with bulges. <b>Sidewall</b> <b>Bulge</b> and Depression is {{also referred to as}} bulge and dent, and bumpy sidewall.|$|E
50|$|The {{tire tread}} and {{sidewall}} elements undergo deformation and recovery {{as they enter}} and exit the footprint. Since the rubber is elastomeric, it is deformed during this cycle. As the rubber deforms and recovers, it imparts cyclical forces into the vehicle. These variations are collectively referred to as tire uniformity. Tire uniformity is characterized by radial force variation (RFV), lateral force variation (LFV) and tangential force variation. Radial and lateral force variation is measured on a force variation machine {{at the end of}} the manufacturing process. Tires outside the specified limits for RFV and LFV are rejected. Geometric parameters, including radial runout, lateral runout, and <b>sidewall</b> <b>bulge,</b> are measured using a tire uniformity machine at the tire factory {{at the end of the}} manufacturing process as a quality check. In the late 1990s, Hunter Engineering introduced the GSP9700 Road Force balancer, which is equipped with a load roller similar to the force variation machine used at the factory to grade tire uniformity. This machine can find the best position for the tire on a given wheel so that the over-all assembly is as round as possible.|$|E
50|$|Contact Stylus {{technology}} utilizes a touch-probe to {{ride along}} the tire surface as it rotates. Analog instrumentation senses {{the movement of}} the probe, and records the run-out waveform. When used to measure radial runout, the stylus is fitted to a large-area paddle that can span the voids in the tread pattern. When used to measure lateral runout on the sidewall the stylus runs in a very narrow smooth track. The contact stylus method is one of the earliest technologies, and requires considerable effort to maintain its mechanical performance. The small area-of-interest in the sidewall area limits the effectiveness in discerning <b>sidewall</b> <b>bulges</b> and depressions elsewhere on the sidewall.|$|R
50|$|Sheet-of-Light Laser (SL) Systems were {{introduced}} in 2003, and have emerged as the most capable and reliable run-out, bulge and depression measurement methods. SL sensors project a laser line instead of a laser point, and thereby create a very large area-of-interest. Sidewall sensors can easily span an area from the bead area to the tread shoulder, and inspect the complete <b>sidewall</b> for <b>bulge</b> and depression defects. Large radial sensors can span 300mm or more to cover the entire tread width. This enables characterization of RRO in multiple tracks. SL sensors also feature stand off distances large enough to assure no collisions with the tire. Two-dimensional tread void filtering and sidewall letter filtering are also employed to eliminate these characteristics from the runout measurements.|$|R
40|$|A static {{finite element}} stress {{analysis}} of an inflated radial car tire was carried out. The deformed {{shape of the}} <b>sidewall</b> presents outward <b>bulging.</b> The analysis of a homogeneous isotropic toroidal shell shows {{that the problem is}} common to all solids of this type. The study suggests that the geometric stiffness due to the inflation pressure has to be taken into account. Also, the resulting large displacements make it necessary for the geometry to be updated at each load step...|$|R
40|$|Competitive {{aerodynamic}} {{performance of}} a Formula One car relies upon total understanding of the downstream wake of exposed rotating wheels. Sensitivities to the downstream vortices and low stagnation-pressure regions lead to subtle design decisions in bargeboards, side-pods and {{the leading edge of}} the highly sensitive floor region. A significant proportion of an F 1 aerodynamicist's time is spent dealing with front wheel wake structures and indeed much of the front wing is developed to provide pressure gradients and vortex structures to control this wake. Wind tunnel testing of scaled deformable tyres has become a common occurrence in F 1 in recent years although there is a significant lack of available literature, academic or otherwise. Due to high vertical loads experienced by a grand prix car and the relatively high levels of camber used for mechanical advantage, the use of a rigid tyre is no longer considered suitable for the accurate simulation of an F 1 wheel wake. This investigation has studied in detail the aerodynamic consequences born from <b>sidewall</b> <b>bulge</b> and contact patch parameters through the use of an innovative rotating sidewall scanning technique, static contact patch measurements, five-hole pressure-probe wake measurements, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and load-cell drag measurements. A table of three-dimensional coordinates for the maximum and minimum deformation levels has been included in this paper to enable further CFD studies to be undertaken. For longevity of tyre and moving ground plane, deformation levels are often fairly conservative in industrial and race team applications. The work presented here includes a full range of on-track axle heights, which far exceed those usually tested in the aforementioned settings and the aerodynamic consequences of under-deforming have been identified. It has been concluded that insufficient deformation of the tyre sidewalls leads to a significant overestimate in the width of the wake as well as the aerodynamic loads associated with it. As a result of this study, the most sensitive parameters of a deformable tyre relating to aerodynamic testing have been identified and summarised. For development of an F 1 car, a compromise in tyre pressure is considered less detrimental to the downstream wake compared to providing insufficient deformation with an incorrect axle height. ...|$|E
40|$|Competitive {{performance}} of an F 1 race car relies upon a well designed and highly developed aerodynamic system. In {{order to achieve}} this, total understanding of the downstream wake of exposed rotating wheels is essential. Components such as bargeboards and indeed much of the front wing are developed to provide pressure gradients and vortex structures to influence the wheel wake, ensuring high energy mass-flow to the sensitive {{leading edge of the}} underfloor and eventually the rear wing. Wind tunnel testing of model-scale deformable tyres has become a common occurrence in F 1 in recent years although there is a significant lack of available literature, academic or otherwise, as to their use. This work has studied in detail the aerodynamic consequences which occur from the varying <b>sidewall</b> <b>bulge</b> and contact patch region making use of several techniques. These include scanning rotating tyre profiles under load, static contact patch size measurements, five-hole pressure probe wake measurements, particle image velocimetry (PIV) and load-cell drag measurements. CFD simulations utilising two industrial codes have also been performed to support the experimental work. Coordinates representing tyre profiles under a range of on-track conditions are available for other researchers to use as a basis for CFD studies. The work presented here includes a full range of representative on-track axle heights which far exceed the more conservative range usually tested in an industrial setting for longevity reasons. The most sensitive parameters for aerodynamic testing of wheels have been identified. For development of a full car, in decreasing order of priority, the following must be correctly matched to the realistic scenario: axle height, yaw condition (without glycerol - often used to reduce friction at the expense of a compromised tyre profile), camber angle, detailed internals, high inflation pressure, through-hub flow rate and least significantly the rotation of the internal brake rotor. The study of through-hub flows revealed that the external aerodynamic effect of the brake scoop inlet varies significantly with the amount of internal restriction. The pumping effect of the brake rotor was measured to be negligible compared to the restrictive effect of its internal passages and that leads to an effect known as inlet spillage with a negative cooling drag trend, whereby the drag of the wheel assembly decreases with increased through-hub flow...|$|E
