40|$|Introduction: Endotracheal tube <b>suctioning</b> is {{essential}} for improve oxygenation in the patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. There {{are two types of}} shallow and deep endotracheal tube <b>suctioning.</b> This study aimed to evaluate the effect of shallow and deep <b>suctioning</b> methods on respiratory rate (RR), arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2) and number of <b>suctioning</b> in patients hospitalized in the intensive care units of Al-Zahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 74 patients who hospitalized in the intensive care units of Isfahan Al-Zahra Hospital were randomly allocated to the shallow and deep <b>suctioning</b> groups. RR and SpO 2 were measured immediately before, immediately after, 1 and 3 minute after each <b>suctioning.</b> Number of <b>suctioning</b> was also noted in each groups. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA), chi-square and independent t-tests. Results: RR was significantly increased and SpO 2 was significantly decreased after each <b>suctioning</b> in the both groups. However, these changes were not significant between the two groups. The numbers of <b>suctioning</b> was significantly higher in the shallow <b>suctioning</b> group than in the deep <b>suctioning</b> group. Conclusion: Shallow and deep <b>suctioning</b> had a similar effect on RR and SpO 2. However, shallow <b>suctioning</b> caused further manipulation of patient’s trachea than deep <b>suctioning</b> method. Therefore, it seems that deep endotracheal tube <b>suctioning</b> method can be used to clean the airway with lesser manipulation of the trachea...|$|R

In the UFD technique, relatively tightly spaced, useful crossflow vortices are excited once, grow to nonlinearly large amplitudes due to primary instability, and deform the baseflow thus suppressing otherwise naturally growing, nocent vortices with larger spanwise spacing, and do not cause secondary instability that otherwise rapidly invokes turbulence.

50|$|At <b>suctions</b> {{less than}} one-third bar, water moves in all {{directions}} via unsaturated flow {{at a rate that}} is dependent on the square of the diameter of the water-filled pores.

Doubling the diameter of the pores increases the flow rate by a factor of four. Large pores drained by gravity and not filled with water do not greatly increase the flow rate for unsaturated flow. Water flow is primarily from coarse-textured soil into fine-textured soil and is slowest in fine-textured soils such as clay.|$|E

50|$|Process: The {{evaporation}} surface (1) <b>suctions</b> {{water out}} of the capillary basin (6), puts the capillary pump (8) for the flooding process in action and quickly fills the surface from top to bottom. Then it drips into the catch basin (2). The water evaporates and sets the air circulation into motion. The drained water closes the hose (3) below. Here, air which flows via pipe into the water tank (5) is interrupted. The water in the tank can no longer flow out because under-pressure occurs. The residual water in the capillary basin (6), on the upper part, is evaporated by the evaporation surface (1). The residual water in the catch basin (2), on the bottom, is suctioned out by the lime separator (7) and evaporated. As soon as the catch basin is empty, air then flows again through the hose (3); water from the tank flows back to the capillary basins (6) and thereby begins the process again. The alternating filling levels for the catch and capillary basins suppress the creation of germs.|$|E
