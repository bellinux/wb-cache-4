5|$|During the Prussian {{invasion}} of Hesse in June 1866, Victoria and Elisabeth {{were sent to}} England {{to live with their}} grandmother until hostilities were ended by the absorption of Hesse-Kassel and parts of Hesse-Darmstadt into Prussia. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, military hospitals were set up in the palace grounds at Darmstadt, and she helped in the soup kitchens with her mother. <b>She</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> intense cold of the winter, and being burned on the arm by hot soup. In 1872, Victoria's eighteen-month-old brother, Friedrich, was diagnosed with haemophilia. The diagnosis came as a shock to the royal families of Europe; it had been twenty years since Queen Victoria had given birth to her haemophiliac son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, {{and it was the first}} indication that the bleeding disorder in the royal family was hereditary. The following year, Friedrich fell from a window onto stone steps and died. It was the first of many tragedies to beset the Hesse family.|$|E
5|$|Many {{years after}} the event, the Kentish {{antiquarian}} J. Meadows Cooper related that while sitting in a pub {{on the outskirts of}} Margate on Boxing Day 1855 he had encountered a party carrying a hooden horse that entered the building. Another local resident, Mrs. Edward Tomlin, later related that as a child she had lived at a house named Updown that was near to Margate, and that <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> hooden horse visiting them at Christmas time during the 1850s and up until 1865. Maylam's researches also found recollections of a hooden horse which had appeared in Herne and Swalecliffe but which been discontinued in the 1860s, another that was active from Wingate Farm House in Harbledown during the 1850s, and one that had been active at Evington but which had ceased by the 1860s. He found another based at Lower Hardres which had been active from at least the least the 1850s under the leadership of Henry Brazier; it was subsequently taken over by his son John, until the tradition ended locally in 1892.|$|E
25|$|She {{was born}} on 31 March 1896 and said <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> Boer War. At the age of four she saw Queen Victoria when the queen visited Leeds. In 1920, she married painter and {{decorator}} Clifford Baldwin and moved to Woodhouse. After his death in 1973, Baldwin lived alone until she was 105, still being able to put up curtains and clean windows. She then moved to Radcliffe Gardens, a nursing home in Leeds.|$|E

The past is {{consumed}} {{in the present and}} the present is living only because it brings forth the future. Statues of women, if Lynch be right, should always be fully draped, one hand of the woman feeling regretfully her own hinder parts.|$|R

25|$|When Delaney {{wrote her}} memoir late in life, <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> Major {{and his wife}} Fanny Berry as kind slaveholders.

After the major died in a duel, Fanny Berry married Robert Wash, a lawyer later {{appointed}} as a Missouri State Supreme Court judge. When Fanny Wash died, the Berry slave family's fortunes changed. Judge Wash sold Lucy Ann's father to a plantation down the Mississippi River in the Deep South.|$|E
500|$|Expecting {{to show a}} new {{and more}} mature side visually, TLC were in Los Angeles {{discussing}} about the project when a Matthew Rolston-directed music video for Salt-N-Pepa came on. [...] "We were looking at it and said, 'Whoever did this video has to do the 'Creep' video. We {{fell in love with the}} way it was shot," [...] Thomas said. Often times, <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> video that they were seeing was [...] "Whatta Man", however, during their interview with MTV in 1995, the show cited [...] "None of Your Business", a video which was also done by Rolston and had more visual similarities to the final [...] "Creep" [...] video. Lopes also recalled the moment: [...] "We were very, very adamant about redoing the 'Creep' video because we were coming back out [...] And we were like, 'Look at that video Salt-N-Pepa got. Man, we're going to kick nobody's butts putting these videos out. [...] is budi, [...] is whack, we've got to do it over.'" [...] Their management team then suggested going back to the editing room to find better shots and have the video redone, but group declined and said: [...] "There is no better shot." [...] Initially, TLC reached out to Rolston and set up the third version's shooting in LA.|$|E

[...] <b>She</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> bedroom scene where her dying mother received the last sacraments while Thérèse knelt and her father cried. She wrote: [...] "When Mummy died, my happy disposition changed. I had been so lively and open; now I became diffident and oversensitive, crying if anyone looked at me.

2500|$|In 1951 Karl Winsch {{took over}} as manager of South Bend. By the time the season rolled around, his wife Jean Faut was a {{successful}} and established pitcher. She {{led the league in}} strikeouts (135), tied for seventh in wins (15), and ranked third in earned run average (1.33) and in shutouts (seven). Wagoner, who was proficient at hitting line drives, played 110 games and hit a [...]272 average (102-for-375), driving in 41 runs and scoring 77 times to set career numbers in both categories. Faut reached her peak of the season on July 21, when she hurled a perfect game against the visiting Rockford Peaches at Playland Park. Ahead 2–0, she struck out five of the last nine hitters, including pitching ace Helen Nicol to end the game. Faut gave considerable credit for her perfect performance to the flawless fielding of her teammates. I had an extremely good team behind me, she recalled years later. To this day <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> shoestring catch Wagoner made on the right field foul line in the second inning. That was the only real scare I had. That was a tremendous catch, adding that Wagoner ran a long way on a dead run to snag it justoff the ground.|$|E
