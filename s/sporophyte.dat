5|$|Like most brown algae, Postelsia {{goes through}} {{alternation}} of generations, {{and is an}} annual species. The diploid <b>sporophyte</b> produces, through meiosis, haploid spores, which drip down through the grooves in the blades onto the substrate, which may be mussels, barnacles, or bare rock. These spores develop, through mitosis, into small, multicellular haploid gametophytes, male and female. The male and female gametophytes create sperm and eggs, respectively. The sperm of the male reaches the female egg and fertilizes, resulting in a diploid zygote, which develops into a new <b>sporophyte.</b>|$|E

The spores are tetrahedral to globose, yellow in color, and measure 41 to 58micrometers(μm) in diameter (averaging 51.4μm), on average larger than other species in the A.pedatum complex.

40|$|Stipe {{lengths of}} <b>sporophytes</b> of Ecklonia cava Kjellman have been {{reported}} to be longer along the southeast than southwest coast of the Izu Peninsula, central Japan. Two bays in this region that have natural populations of E. cava, but with different stipe lengths, were chosen for transplant experiments to examine if stipe length was an environmentally controlled trait. Transplant experiments were carried out in order to determine whether large-type <b>sporophytes</b> of E. cava with long stipes growing in Nabeta Bay (southeast Izu Peninsula, Japan) would turn into small-type <b>sporophytes</b> with short stipes when transplanted to Nakagi Bay (southwest Izu Peninsula). Ten juvenile <b>sporophytes</b> of E. cava (stipe length < 5 cm) were collected from Nabeta Bay (large-type habitat) and transplanted to Nakagi Bay (short-type habitat) in December 1995. As a transplant control, ten juvenile <b>sporophytes</b> of E. cava growing in Nakagi Bay were also transplanted to the same artificial reefs. Growth and survival rates of the <b>sporophytes</b> were monitored monthly for 3 y until December 1998. The transplanted <b>sporophytes</b> showed an increase in their stipe length and diameter from winter to spring, whereas almost no increase was observed from summer to autumn. However, the elongation was greater in Nabeta <b>sporophytes</b> than in Nakagi <b>sporophytes.</b> The primary blade length increased mainly from winter to early spring and decreased largely in autumn. Average primary blade lengths were similar in both Nabeta and Nakagi <b>sporophytes</b> {{from the end of the}} first year of transplanting. Although ca. 70 % of both Nabeta and Nakagi <b>sporophytes</b> survived during the first 2 y after transplantation, no Nakagi <b>sporophytes</b> and only two Nabeta <b>sporophytes</b> survived to the end of the 3 y study period. Despite transplantation to Nakagi Bay, where short sitpes are naturally present, the <b>sporophytes</b> from Nabeta Bay persisted in having longer stipes, which suggests that stipe length is genetically, rather than environmentally, controlled. <br /...|$|R

Numerous studies have evaluated the ability plants to remove contaminants from the environment. The present study evaluated the ability of Ceratopteris richardii gametophytes and <b>sporophytes</b> to tolerate copper, lead and zinc and for the <b>sporophytes</b> to accumulate the three metals in their shoots. Spores were sown in plant medium treated with varying concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn. Fifteen-day- old <b>sporophytes</b> were transferred into medium mixed with varying concentrations of the three metals. Ceratopteris richardii tolerated and accumulated each of the three metals differently.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{behaviour}} of the fern Osmunda regalis in in vitro culture, to identify the most suitable conditions for possible micropropagation. Starting material was constituted by spores harvested from a mature plant. Spores, germinated on gelled Hoagland and Arnon growth medium, produced normal gametophytes and <b>sporophytes.</b> <b>Sporophytes</b> cultivated both on MS and Hoagland and Arnon growth media consistently were susceptible to tissue vitrification, even when different cytokinins were used. On hormone-free growth medium, <b>sporophytes</b> looked normal and underwent considerable growth but secondary meristems were produced only rarely.

5|$|The Rhynia {{plant was}} small and stick-like, with simple dichotomously {{branching}} stems without leaves, each tipped by a sporangium. The simple form echoes that of the <b>sporophyte</b> of mosses, {{and it has been}} shown that Rhynia had an alternation of generations, with a corresponding gametophyte in the form of crowded tufts of diminutive stems only a few millimetres in height. Rhynia thus falls midway between mosses and early vascular plants like ferns and clubmosses. From a carpet of moss-like gametophytes, the larger Rhynia sporophytes grew much like simple clubmosses, spreading by means of horizontal growing stems growing rhizoids that anchored the plant to the substrate. The unusual mix of moss-like and vascular traits and the extreme structural simplicity of the plant had huge implications for botanical understanding.|$|E

40|$|Based on genetic differentiation, the haploid {{dioecious}} bryophyte taxa Polytrichum commune and P. uliginosum {{have been}} inferred {{to be completely}} reproductively isolated. However, analysing diploid <b>sporophytes</b> from a sympatric population for three diagnostic microsatellite markers, we show here that reproductive isolation between these taxa is far more complex and highly asymmetric. Isolation between female-P. communexmale-P. uliginosum seems to be complete and prezygotic (or early postzygotic) as no hybrid <b>sporophytes</b> were observed on P. commune females. In the other direction (female-P. uliginosumxmale-P. commune) isolation was clearly postzygotic as high frequencies of hybrid <b>sporophytes</b> were found on P. uliginosum females. However, during maturation these <b>sporophytes</b> showed irregular development, indicating that hybrid <b>sporophytes</b> are unlikely to produce ripe spores. Mechanisms possibly underlying this asymmetric reproductive isolation pattern are discussed. Notwithstanding hybrid offspring being unlikely, the high frequency of hybrid <b>sporophytes</b> observed suggests that viable spores may be formed occasionally through such rare processes as chromosome nondisjunction, possibly giving rise to allodiploids. Allodiploids {{have been reported in}} Polytrichum (and other bryophyte genera).

(The taxobox at the right represents their view of the classification of the polysporangiophytes.) The defining feature of the clade is that the <b>sporophyte</b> branches and bears multiple sporangia.

40|$|Young <b>sporophytes</b> of short-stipe ecotype of Ecklonia cava from {{a warmer}} {{locality}} (Tei, Kochi Pref., southern Japan) {{and those of}} long-stipe ecotype from a cooler locality (Nabeta, Shizuoka Pref., central Japan) were transplanted in 1995 to artificial reefs immersed at the habitat of long-stipe ecotype in Nabeta Bay, Shizuoka Pref., central Japan. The characteristics of photosynthesis and respiration of bladelets of the transplanted <b>sporophytes</b> of the two ecotypes were compared in winter and summer 1997; the results were assessed per unit area, per unit chlorophyllacontent and per unit dry weight. In photosynthesis-light curves at 10 – 29 °C, light saturation occurred at 200 – 400 µmol photon m – 2 s – 1 in <b>sporophytes</b> from both Tei and Nabeta. The maximum photosynthetic rate (P max) at 10 – 29 °C and the light-saturation index (I k) at 25 – 29 °C in <b>sporophytes</b> from both localities were generally higher in winter than in summer. P max at 25 – 29 °C (per unit area and chlorophylla) were higher in <b>sporophytes</b> from Tei than those from Nabeta in both seasons. The optimum temperature for photosynthesis was 25 °C in winter and 27 °C in summer at high light intensities of 100 – 400 µmol photon m – 2 s – 1. However, at lower light intensities of 12. 5 – 50 µmol photon m – 2 s – 1, it was 20 °C in winter and 25 – 27 °C in summer for <b>sporophytes</b> from both locations.

40|$|Abstract – Information {{is limited}} on the {{presence}} of endophytic fungal associations in green gametophytes and young <b>sporophytes</b> of extant ferns. Nothing is known about their presence in Polypodiales, the largest order among extant ferns. We screened chlorophyl-lous gametophytes and young <b>sporophytes</b> of Nephrolepis exaltata (L.) Schott., (Loma-riopsidaceae, Polypodiales) growing naturally on soil, brick and coir for the presence of fungal endophytes. Gametophytes and young <b>sporophytes</b> growing on different substrates were invariably colonized by septate endophytic fungi. Hyaline or brown, regularly septate, inter- or intracellular hyphae with moniliform cells or microsclerotia character-ized septate endophytic fungi. However, only the roots of young <b>sporophytes</b> growing on soil and bricks harboured arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The AM morphology con-formed to the intermediate type with intracellular hyphal coils, arbusculate coils and intercellular hyphae. No AM fungal spores could be retrieved from the soil on which gametophytes and young <b>sporophytes</b> were growing. The observations in this study sup-port the idea that the septate fungal endophytes could confer an ecological advantage on colonized individuals, especially on nutrient deficient substrates...|$|R
25|$|Polysporangiophytes, {{also called}} polysporangiates or {{formally}} Polysporangiophyta, are plants {{in which the}} spore-bearing generation (<b>sporophyte)</b> has branching stems (axes) that terminate in sporangia. The name literally means many sporangia plant. The clade includes all land plants (embryophytes) except for the bryophytes (liverworts, mosses and hornworts) whose sporophytes are always unbranched. While the definition is independent {{of the presence of}} vascular tissue, all living polysporangiophytes also have vascular tissue, i.e., are vascular plants or tracheophytes. Fossil polysporangiophytes are known that have no vascular tissue, and so are not tracheophytes.|$|E
25|$|The sori are pale brown, {{resembling}} {{those of}} the parent species. The chromosome number of the <b>sporophyte</b> is 2n = 108; it is a triploid. As a hybrid triploid, A.×trudellii is unable to undergo meiosis to form spores, and its spores are typically abortive and sterile. Such {{was the case in}} examinations of Georgia, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania material by Wherry and Paul Kestner in 1932. Both found only sterile spores. However, the species has been observed, particularly along the lower Susquehanna River, to form colonies, suggesting that it undergoes independent reproduction. This has been hypothesized to occur by apogamy, yielding triploid spores and gametophytes which then grow directly into a new generation of triploid sporophytes.|$|E
25|$|Sphagnum, {{like all}} other land plants, has an {{alternation}} of generations; like other bryophytes, the haploid gametophyte generation is dominant and persistent. Unlike other mosses, the long-lived gametophytes do not rely upon rhizoids to assist in water uptake. Sphagnum species can be unisexual (male or female, dioecious) or bisexual (male and female gametes produced from the same plant; monoecious); In North America, 80% of Sphagnum species are unisexual. Gametophytes have substantial asexual reproduction by fragmentation, producing much of the living material in sphagnum peatlands. Swimming sperm fertilize eggs contained in archegonia that remain attached to the female gametophyte. The <b>sporophyte</b> is relatively short-lived, and consists almost entirely of a shiny green, spherical spore capsule that becomes black with spores. Sporophytes are raised on stalks to facilitate spore dispersal, but unlike other mosses, Sphagnum stalks are produced by the maternal gametophyte. Tetrahedral haploid spores are produced in the <b>sporophyte</b> by meiosis, which are then dispersed when the capsule explosively discharges its cap, called an operculum, and shoots the spores some distance. The spores germinate to produce minute protonemae, which start as filaments, can become thalloid, and can produce a few rhizoids. Soon afterwards the protonema develops buds and these differentiate into its characteristic, erect, leafy, branched gametophyte with chlorophyllose cells and hyaline cells. This stage dominates the environment where Sphagnum grows, obliterating and burying the protonema and eventually building up into layers of dead moss called peat. Carpets of living Sphagnum may be attacked by various fungi, and one fungus that is also a mushroom, Sphagnurus paluster, produces conspicuous dead patches. When this fungus and other agarics attack the protonema, Sphagnum is induced to produce non-photosynthetic gemmae that can survive the fungal attack and months later germinate to produce new protonema and leafy gametophytes. It is unknown whether the leafy stage can produce such gemmae.|$|E

A total of 11 characters of Undaria were measured to determine a reliable morphological character representing its growth and reproduction. Plant weight of Undaria <b>sporophytes</b> increased steadily over the experimental period, but it increased in four different ways. Undaria pinnatifida increased body weight by growth in length and width (October–early December), and by growth in width with the thickening of blade and stipe when <b>sporophytes</b> began to be fertile (December–January). In the middle of January, growth in length and width had almost stopped with the maturation of Undaria <b>sporophytes.</b> Finally, the weight of Undaria increased again by growth in width at the end of February.

Plant weight was positively correlated and fitted well with stipe width and blade width. The blade of Undaria was very thin (ca. 254  μm) and breakable by wave action, but its stipe was strong and relatively thick (ca. 8. 7  mm). Furthermore, the fertility of U. pinnatifida was fitted better with stipe width than blade width.

Pteridophytic vascular plants with true xylem and phloem that reproduced by spores germinating into free-living gametophytes evolved during the Silurian period and diversified into several lineages {{during the late}} Silurian and early Devonian.

40|$|ABSTRACT Title of Dissertation: THE ROLE OF AUXIN ON THE EVOLUTION OF EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT AND AXIS FORMATION IN LAND PLANTS DorothyBelle Poli, Doctor of Philosophy, 2005 Dissertation {{directed}} by: Professor Todd J. Cooke, Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics This thesis {{examined the}} role of auxin {{in the evolution of}} land plants. Several approaches were used to study how auxin regulates the development in the bryophyte <b>sporophytes.</b> The altered growth of isolated young <b>sporophytes</b> exposed to applied auxin (indole- 3 -acetic acid) or an auxin antagonist (p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid) suggested that endogenous auxin regulates the rates of axial growth in all bryophyte divisions. In the hornwort Phaeoceros personii, auxin moved at very low fluxes, was insensitive to an auxin-transport inhibitor (N-[1 -naphthyl]phthalamic acid), and exhibited a polarity ratio close to 1. 0, implying that auxin moves by simple diffusion. The liverwort Pellia epiphylla exhibited somewhat higher auxin fluxes, which were sensitive to transport inhibitors but lacked any measurable polarity. Thus, auxin movement in liverwort <b>sporophytes</b> appears to result from facilitated diffusion. In the moss Polytrichum ohioensis, auxin movement was predominantly basipetal in young <b>sporophytes</b> and occurred at high fluxes exceeding those measured in maize coleoptiles. In older <b>sporophytes,</b> acropetal auxin flux had increased beyond the level measured for basipetal flux in the specimens observed in several, but not all, seasons. The evidence from both inhibitor treatments and isolated tissues is consistent with the interpretation that the cortex carries out basipetal transport in both younger and older <b>sporophytes,</b> whereas the central vascular tissues carries out basipetal transport in younger <b>sporophytes</b> and acropetal flux in older <b>sporophytes.</b> Given the significant differences in fall rainfall in the collection years, the purported sensitivity of vascular tissue development may account for the seasonal variation observed in these experiments. Auxin regulators and polar transport were also used to study the regulation of the embryogenesis of the fern Marsilea vestita. Auxin biosynthesis inhibitors affected initial cell proliferation resulting in the formation of aborted embryos, p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid delayed growth and development in all stages of embryogenesis while &# 61537;-naphthaleneacetic acid mediated rapid cell proliferation that caused enlarged disorganized embryos. Polar auxin transport inhibitors caused no significant abnormalities, which suggested a limited role for polar transport in fern embryogenesis. In conclusion, this evidence suggests that auxin is ultimately involved in the establishment of the body plans in all land plant <b>sporophytes...</b>|$|R
