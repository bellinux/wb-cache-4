To assess {{the resistance of}} switchgear in <b>switching</b> <b>substations</b> which use 3 / 2 wiring, online assessment method based on real-time current measurements is proposed in this paper. The method use Kirchhoff’s law to establish the mathematical model of <b>switching</b> <b>substations</b> which use 3 / 2 wiring.

40|$|A {{significant}} increase in the distributed generating sources connected and planned for connection to medium voltage (MV) grids makes voltage criteria very important in assessing the sources’ connectivity.

With the ongoing growth of the electric utility industry, including deregulation in many countries; numerous changes are continuously being introduced to a once predictable system.

Insufficient reactive power support affects the reliable operation of electric power systems leading to voltage collapses as observed by the 2003 National blackout.

40|$|Every {{switching}} operation {{in a power}} substation must be executed after proper evaluation of its consequence. Often, switching actions for various operating conditions and contingencies are pre determined by using the control engineer's knowledge and previous experience. When the need arises, either a computer or an operator carries out these actions. However, {{it is difficult for}} an operator to know all the operating conditions and contingencies in advance. An on line decision making tool can provide an operator with the most appropriate switching decisions for the present system configuration and system state so the continuity and quality of power supply can be maintained by implementing those switching decisions. Since the circuit configuration varies from one substation to another, such decision-making tools developed for one substation may not be applicable to another substation. This thesis presents a technique to design digital computer based <b>substation</b> <b>switching</b> schemes. The technique is applicable to all practical substations. The rules of interlocking and sequence switching used by the schemes are generalized and are not based upon a particular substation configuration. While being applicable to all substations, these schemes also ensure the most appropriate {{switching operation}}s with minimum operator intervention. The switching schemes ensure the safety of the system before making any switching action. They assist human operators in the evaluation of abnormal circumstances and are easy to integrate with other monitoring, control and protection systems. A software application for developing <b>switching</b> schemes for <b>substations</b> called SSP was developed by using the techniques presented in this thesis.

The accuracy of time correlation is smaller than 1. 4 μs. As a result, it provides excellent scalability and is well suited for the measurement of analogue signals spread over a large physical space with time synchronisation. Another major difference is that the new system uses wireless links and programmable devices to replace cables and data acquisition equipment of currently available systems, thus making the new measurement system more compact, flexible and much more powerful.

40|$|This paper investigates voltage and {{reactive}} power control in distribution systems {{and how the}} presence of synchronous machine-based distributed generation (DG) affects the control.

The power-flow reversal due to the DG is shown not to interfere with the effectiveness of the OLTC operation. Further, it is also shown {{that as long as the}} available capacitors are enough to compensate the reactive power demand, the DG operation mode does not give a significant effect to the distribution system losses. However, DG operating at a constant voltage is beneficial for a significant reduction of OLTC operation and voltage fluctuation in the distribution system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Through several giant {{evolutionary}} steps, Ethernet {{has become}} an almost ubiquitous technology for communication. Being versatile enough to be employed in new and various fields of application, it is now making inroads in factories. However, automated systems are different from many other applications of Ethernet, first and foremost because they require the network technology to deliver real-time performance. In the present study, a number of critical aspects of Ethernet, usually referred to as an Industrial Ethernet, are examined. More specifically, there is {{a focus on the}} application-to-application delay and jitter characteristics of such networks, when using Internet protocols such as UDP and TCP. It is demonstrated {{how important it is to}} take control of the latency in the station nodes, since the main communication delays occur inside the nodes, and different solutions are presented for controlling these delays. In particular, a priority-based protocol stack is assessed. The results show that real-time, Ethernet-based IP communication is now adequate even for demanding automated applications. In this paper, sub-station automation (power distribution) is used as an example of a demanding automation system.

These transients have traveling wave behavior and travel to external systems through discontinuities and interface such as enclosures, bushings, cable joints etc. Depending up on configuration of the GIS and the amplitude of the electric and magnetic fields could be of the order of a few tens of kilovolts per meter and a few hundreds of amps per meter respectively. These very fast transient over (VFTO) voltages create critical situations in protection circuit and control circuit and makes raise faults in cables, transformers and secondary circuits, which result in malfunctioning of the primary equipment.

40|$|Abstract:- Distribution {{control systems}} are {{normally}} managed by experienced control engineers who manage the different switching operations {{in order to}} isolate one or more stations for maintenance or for repairing faults. Whenever a fault takes place, these engineers have to quickly prepare a switching plan to isolate a station or a complete circuit {{which is a very}} logically complex task due to the complexity of current and voltage flow and the challenging task of ensuring the minimum disturbance to the current supply to the customers. The distribution network is a very dynamic environment of changing circuits and flow and contains thousands of <b>substations,</b> <b>switching</b> stations, feeders, poles, switches, circuit breakers and cables. Preparing a switching plan requires knowledge of the up-to-date network. The switching plan is normally prepared manually and can take from a few minutes to a few hours to complete in order to reduce risk to field workers and to minimize the supply disturbance. In this paper, we have analyzed the switching plans mechanism and developed a number of algorithms to help the control engineers prepare switching plans quickly and put them to action. Our method not only ensures that the disturbance of the supply to customers is reduced but also minimizes the risk to the filed engineers. In this paper, we show only a sample of the many automatically prepared switching plans which have been tested and proven...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Electrical {{power systems}} (EPS) are systems that include energy generation, {{transmission}} and distribution. One {{of the most}} important components of EPS corresponds to the electrical substation, which is utilized to control, modify, distribute and direct the electricity flow. The quality level of these systems is regulated by using Service Level Agreements (SLAs) which specify, for instance, maximum downtime per year. Penalties may apply if the quality level is not satisfied. On the other hand, fault tolerance techniques employ redundant equipment to increase the availability level of general systems, and the use of spare devices may incur additional infrastructure costs. Thus, to meet the SLA requirements, electrical system designers need to evaluate the dependability level of these systems. It is important to state that the use of software tools is suitable for dependability metrics evaluation, since it is not trivial to simulate or analyze complex systems. Modeling techniques with a strong mathematical background such as Stochastic Petri Nets (SPN) and Reliability Block Diagrams (RBD) can be adopted to assess dependability in power systems. This work proposes a methodology, which includes a hierarchical heterogeneous modeling technique that considers the advantages of both stochastic Petri nets (SPN) and reliability block diagrams (RBD) to evaluate data center power infrastructures considering <b>substation</b> <b>switching</b> operations.

40|$|The {{earthing}} {{of electric}} installations {{plays an important}} part as regards the behaviour of the network and personal safety when there are disturbances. Presently all earthing designs are performed by contractors and submitted to Ceylon Electricity Board for approval. But {{due to lack of}} information at the tender stage majority of the contractors are unable to bid the earthing design part accurately resulting deviations to the contract during the implementation stage. To minimize this problem Transmission Design Branch and the Transmission Maintenance Branch of the Ceylon Electricity Board jointly decided to do the Earthing Design and submitted with the tender for bidding. After the initial soil resistivity measurements, {{it was found that the}} resistivity values were very high compared to other Grid Substation locations. Therefore it was decided to do an earthing design for Horana Grid Substation to identify the suitabil ity of proposed land and identify the land to be developed to construct an additional earthing mat to transfer the earth fault current. Without a properly designed grounding system large potential differences can exist between different points within the substation itself. Under normal circumstances, the current flow through the grounding grid from line - to - ground faults that constitutes the main threat to personnel. The earthing design for Horana Grid Substation has the following objectives. 1. Ensure such a degree of human safety that a person working or walking in the vicinity of grounded facilities, is not exposed to the danger of a critical electric shock. The touch and step voltages produced in a fault condition have to be at safe levels. A safe value is one that will not produce enough current within a body to case ventricular fibrillation. 2. Provide means to carry and dissipate electric currents into earth under normal and faulty conditions without exceeding any operating and equipment limits or adversely affecting continuity of service. 3. Provide grounding for lightning impulses and the surges occurring from the <b>switching</b> of <b>substation</b> equipment, which reduces damage to equipment. 4.

Compared with the DC system, the AC system can save the anti-stray current devices along the metro line, save rectifier units and DC <b>switches</b> at each <b>substation,</b> and save expensive energy storage devices or renewable energy feedback devices. Consequently the metro’s underground equipment can be simplified, thus occupied area is reduced. In terms of integrated automatic control devices [4, 5, 6], both the DC and AC systems have the similar scale and costs. However, the AC system needs to have the NCDs, the cost for an AC–DC–C train is higher than that for a DC–AC train. Generally, one-time costs of an AC system may be close {{to that of a}} DC system, but the MSS installed capacity of an AC traction system is significantly lower than the capacity sum of all individual SSs. Thus power resources and costs of the basic electricity are saved. In an AC system, the renewable energy can be directly used in an efficient way, resulting in further saving of power cost. All of these merits to an AC system are beneficial to the economy and in line with the national policy of energy conservation and emission reduction.|$|R
