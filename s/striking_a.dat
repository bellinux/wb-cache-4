5|$|Gillan is {{a passionate}} {{football}} fan, supporting Queens Park Rangers. He {{is also a}} big fan of cricket. He is also known for his intolerance of aggressive crowd security personnel at concerts. On 15 August 1998, he was charged with assault after <b>striking</b> <b>a</b> security guard on the head with a microphone.|$|E
5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack of knowledge of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry of the impact sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating shock waves from the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles <b>striking</b> <b>a</b> planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E
5|$|After the {{war ended}} in 1945, {{first-class}} cricket resumed in 1945–46. Harvey played in a trial match for state selection. Playing for the Rest of Victoria against the first-choice state team, he made 82 and 25. This {{was not enough to}} convince the state selectors and Harvey did not get a recall to the Victorian team {{until the end of the}} season when he played against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. He responded by <b>striking</b> <b>a</b> career-best 163 to help his team to an innings win.|$|E

5|$|Evidence of {{abstract}} thinking {{can be seen}} in the archaeological record as early as the Acheulean-Middle Stone Age transition, approximately 300,000-250,000 years ago. This transition involves a shift in stone tool technology from Mode 2, Acheulean tools, to Mode 3 and 4, which include blades and microliths. The manufacture of these tools requires planning and the understanding of how <b>striking</b> <b>a</b> stone will produce different flaking patterns. This requires abstract thought, one of the hallmarks of modern human behavior. The shift from large cutting tools in the Acheulian to smaller and more diversified toolkits in the MSA represents a better cognitive and conceptual understanding of flintknapping, as well as the potential functional effects of distinct tool types.|$|E
5|$|Further inland, {{moisture}} from Bonnie {{combined with a}} cold front to produce widespread thunderstorms over Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee. In Arkansas, lightning from a severe thunderstorm knocked out power {{to much of the}} city of Rison after <b>striking</b> <b>a</b> transformer. Significant wind damage took place in Dallas County where awnings were blown off homes, structures sustained roof damage, and trees were felled. Heavy rains also triggered localized flash flooding, covering several highways. Throughout the state, storm damage was estimated at $356,000 (2010USD).|$|E
5|$|In May 1941, Edwards became {{commanding}} officer of No. 105 Squadron replacing the previous incumbent, {{who had been killed}} in an anti-shipping raid on Stavanger. At that time, the Squadron was engaged in a series of daylight operations against Germany and the occupied countries, with its principal targets being enemy shipping, power installations, shipbuilding yards, locomotives, steelworks and marshalling yards. On 15 June, by now an acting wing commander, Edwards led six Blenheims on a search for enemy shipping and soon sighted a convoy of eight merchantmen anchored near The Hague. He launched an attack at low level, his bombs <b>striking</b> <b>a</b> 4,000 ton ship. He was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for this action.|$|E

5|$|Miller {{then lifted}} Laker for another six over long off, hitting a spectator in the head. The English captain, noted {{for his ability}} to break {{partnerships}} with his occasional bowling, brought himself on. Miller responded by <b>striking</b> <b>a</b> four over long on from Yardley's bowling to reach 54. He drove the next ball through cover for four. The English skipper responded by stacking the leg side with outfielders and bowled outside leg stump, challenging Miller to attempt another hit for six. Yardley bowled a half-volley outside leg stump and the batsman obliged, but edged the ball off the back of his bat onto wicket-keeper Evans' head and was caught by a forward-diving Edrich at short fine leg.|$|E
5|$|Related to weapon {{dances and}} war dances is {{the dance of}} the hunt. A very early {{reference}} to a weapon dance of the hunt {{comes in the form}} of a rock engraving at Çatal Höyük, the large neolithic settlement in south-central Anatolia. It depicts a hunting ritual involving dancers holding their bows; one figure has a bow in each hand, two perform artistic leaps and another holds a horn-shaped stick and is <b>striking</b> <b>a</b> frame drum.|$|E
5|$|That same year, J.J. Thomson {{conducted}} {{an experiment in}} which he channeled a stream of neon ions through magnetic and electric fields, <b>striking</b> <b>a</b> photographic plate at the other end. He observed two glowing patches on the plate, which suggested two different deflection trajectories. Thomson concluded this was {{because some of the}} neon ions had a different mass. The nature of this differing mass would later be explained by the discovery of neutrons in 1932.|$|E

5|$|The Australians moved {{onto the}} next match against Derbyshire, where Miller scored a half-century and took 3/31 in an innings victory. Against Glamorgan, Miller took two wickets before <b>striking</b> <b>a</b> hard-hitting 84 with five sixes. He struck {{one of the}} sixes with one hand, sending it 20 rows into the crowd. In a match against Lancashire, Jack Ikin had reached 99 despite being {{repeatedly}} hit. Miller refused to bowl to Ikin, saying that he felt the batsman deserved a century. Lindwall was given the ball and promptly removed Ikin for 99.|$|E
5|$|The {{combat system}} in Dwarf Fortress is anatomically detailed. Combat is {{displayed}} by viewing the log which describes each weapon <b>striking</b> <b>a</b> specific {{part of the}} character's body. Internal organs can get punctured, combatants can fall to the ground, vomit and lose body parts. Each dwarf has individually detailed limbs, each with damageable bone, fat, muscle and skin. Fat can be bruised without breaking bones and vice versa. Injuries sometimes can be permanent. There is a medical system where a hospital {{can be set up}} containing crutches for disabled dwarves, traction benches, plasters and cloth for casts and bandages, thread for suturing, and splints.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme music}} was {{composed}} by Peter Davis (who {{after the second}} series composed {{the rest of the}} series alone as principal composer), John Mealing and John G. Perry.

5|$|By 1935, al-Qassam had {{recruited}} {{several hundred}} men—the figures range from 200 to 800—organized in cells of five men, and arranged military training for peasants. The cells were equipped with bombs and firearms, which {{they used to}} raid Jewish settlements and sabotage British-constructed rail lines. Though <b>striking</b> <b>a</b> responsive chord among the rural poor and urban underclass, al-Qassam's movement deeply perturbed the Muslim urban elite as it threatened their political and patronage connections with the British Mandatory authorities. Following the October 1935 discovery of a clandestine cache of arms in the port of Jaffa apparently originating from Belgium and destined for the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary force, Palestinian Arab indignation broke out in two general strikes. The arms shipment to the Haganah served as the final impetus for al-Qassam to launch a revolt against the authorities.|$|E
5|$|France sank after <b>striking</b> <b>a</b> rock in Quiberon Bay in 1922. Between {{the wars}} the {{surviving}} ships were modernised several times, {{but they were}} not rebuilt thoroughly enough to prevent them from becoming obsolete in comparison to modern German or Italian battleships. They were relegated to training duties during the 1930s. Courbet and Paris escaped to Portsmouth where they became depot and accommodation ships after the French armistice in 1940. Jean Bart was demilitarised, renamed Océan, and became a school hulk in Toulon. She was captured there on 27 November 1942, although she was not scuttled. She was used for experiments with large shaped charge warheads by the Germans until she was sunk by the Allies in 1944, later broken up in place in 1945. Courbet was scuttled on 9 June 1944 as a breakwater for a Mulberry harbour used during the Battle of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Carmen was {{the most}} intense {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1974 Atlantic hurricane season. A destructive and widespread storm, Carmen originated as a tropical disturbance that emerged from Africa {{toward the end of}} August. The disturbance traveled westward, spawning a tropical depression east of the Lesser Antilles on August29. The storm moved through the Caribbean Sea, and in an environment conducive to intensification, it quickly strengthened to its initial peak intensity as a Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Carmen moved ashore on the Yucatán Peninsula, where, despite <b>striking</b> <b>a</b> sparsely populated region, it caused significant crop damage and killed several people. Before the storm's arrival, officials had set up several evacuation centers, and many residents had moved to higher ground.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, {{after the}} {{overthrow}} of King Alfonso XIII, his namesake battleship was renamed España. In the mid-1930s, the Spanish Navy considered modernization programs for the two surviving battleships, but none came to fruition, primarily {{as a result of}} the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. The two ships found themselves on opposite sides during the conflict; España served on the side of Francisco Franco's Nationalists, and Jaime I fought for the Republicans. España was used for coastal bombardment and to enforce the blockade of Republican ports, while Jaime I unsuccessfully attempted to disrupt the blockade, though neither ship engaged the other. In August 1936, Jaime I was attacked and moderately damaged by Nationalist bombers; while undergoing repairs in Cartagena, she was destroyed by an internal explosion in June 1937. España was sunk on 30 April 1937 after <b>striking</b> <b>a</b> mine laid by her own side off the coast of Santander in northern Spain.|$|E
5|$|On 27/28 February 1942 33 bombers {{flew over}} Wilhelmshaven looking for Scharnhorst. Cloud {{obscured}} the target area and German reports noted only three explosions. Three Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bombers were lost to unstated causes. In 1942 Scharnhorst had evaded the worst attacks from RAF Bomber Command. It {{was ready for}} redeployment by the summer, {{but a series of}} accidents, such as <b>striking</b> <b>a</b> mine and running aground meant this was delayed until the turn of the year. The ship made three unsuccessful attempts to sail to Norway. On 10 January 1943 she was spotted by RAF aircraft and turned back after reaching only the Skagerrak. Another attempt was tried in January but failed. On 3 March 1943 Scharnhorst finally made it to Norway. She would survive another eight months before being sent on her last wartime mission, Operation Ostfront. During her sortie Scharnhorst was sunk at the Battle of the North Cape.|$|E
5|$|Raphel was {{instrumental}} in coordinating the State Department's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Taliban shortly after its takeover of Kabul. A senior Unocal executive commented that the pipeline project would be far easier to implement with the Taliban in control, {{in reference to the}} need for central control in Afghanistan to undertake a project of the size, complexity and cost the Texas-based oil giant was considering. Unocal's consortium also included Saudi Arabia's Delta Oil, Pakistan's Crescent Group and Gazprom of Russia. The project involved building an 890-kilometer gas pipeline that would carry 1.9 billion cubic feet of gas to Pakistan each day. Unocal held detailed discussions with Taliban representatives in Houston in December 1997, <b>striking</b> <b>a</b> deal that would later collapse under the weight of rising U.S. and Afghan domestic political pressures against the Taliban's record on human rights, education and treatment of women.|$|E
