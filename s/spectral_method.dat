30|$|In recent years, <b>spectral</b> <b>methods</b> (see [1 – 8]) {{have often}} {{turned out to}} be {{efficient}} and highly accurate schemes when compared with the local methods. The speed of convergence {{is one of the great}} advantages of <b>spectral</b> <b>methods.</b> Besides, <b>spectral</b> <b>methods</b> have exponential rates of convergence; they also have a high level of accuracy. The main idea of all versions of <b>spectral</b> <b>methods</b> is to express the approximate solution of the problem as a finite sum of certain basis functions (orthogonal polynomials or a combination of them) and then choose the coefficients in order to minimize the difference between the exact and approximate solutions as well as possible. The <b>spectral</b> collocation <b>method</b> is a specific type of <b>spectral</b> <b>methods,</b> which is more applicable and widely used to solve almost all types of the differential equations [9 – 12].|$|R

40|$|As a {{tool for}} {{large-scale}} computations in fluid dynamics, <b>spectral</b> <b>methods</b> were prophesized in 1944, born in 1954, virtually buried in the mid- 1960 's, resurrected in 1969, evangalized in the 1970 's, and catholicized in the 1980 's. The use of <b>spectral</b> <b>methods</b> for meteorological problems was proposed by Blinova in 1944 and the first numerical computations were conducted by Silberman (1954). By the early 1960 's computers had achieved sufficient power to permit calculations with hundreds of degrees of freedom. For problems of this size the traditional way of computing the nonlinear terms in <b>spectral</b> <b>methods</b> was expensive compared with finite-difference <b>methods.</b> Consequently, <b>spectral</b> <b>methods</b> fell out of favor. The expense of computing nonlinear terms remained a severe drawback until Orszag (1969) and Eliasen, Machenauer, and Rasmussen (1970) developed the transform methods that still form the backbone of many large-scale spectral computations. The original proselytes of <b>spectral</b> <b>methods</b> were meteorologists involved in global weather modeling and fluid dynamicists investigating isotropic turbulence. The converts who were inspired by the successes of these pioneers remained, for the most part, confined to these and closely related fields throughout the 1970 's. During that decade <b>spectral</b> <b>methods</b> appeared to be well-suited only for problems governed by ordinary diSerential eqllations or by partial differential equations with periodic boundary conditions. And, of course, the solution itself needed to be smooth. Some of the obstacles to wider application of <b>spectral</b> <b>methods</b> were: (1) poor resolution of discontinuous solutions; (2) inefficient implementation of implicit methods; and (3) drastic geometric constraints. All of these barriers have undergone some erosion during the 1980 's, particularly the latter two. As a result, the applicability and appeal of <b>spectral</b> <b>methods</b> for computational fluid dynamics has broadened considerably. The motivation {{for the use of}} <b>spectral</b> <b>methods</b> in numerical calculations stems from the attractive approximation properties of orthogonal polynomial expansions...|$|R

[...] Use of the <b>spectral</b> <b>method</b> for measuring Microvolt T-wave Alternans has been approved for reimbursement by Medicare, as well as major insurers such as Aetna, Cigna, and Humana. The <b>Spectral</b> <b>Method</b> was FDA approved in 2001 and approved in 2006 for federal reimbursement by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), (CAG-00293N).

50|$|Two {{methods are}} {{currently}} FDA-cleared to perform MTWA {{testing in the}} U.S., namely, the <b>Spectral</b> <b>Method,</b> which was developed by Cohen and Smith at M.I.T. and was commercialized by Cambridge Heart, and the Modified Moving Average (MMA) method, which was developed by Nearing and Verrier at Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and is commercialized by GE Healthcare. The <b>Spectral</b> <b>Method</b> requires a specialized exercise protocol and proprietary electrodes and washout of beta-adrenergic blocking agents to allow the patient to achieve a target heart rate of 105-110 beats/min. The MMA method uses routine, symptom-limited exercise stress testing or ambulatory ECG monitoring and standard electrodes and requires that chronic medications be retained. Both methods achieve 1-microvolt resolution. Interpretation of <b>Spectral</b> <b>Method</b> test results is described above. With the MMA method, risk {{is defined by the}} peak MTWA level, with cutpoints of 47µV and 60 µV for abnormal and severely abnormal risk, respectively. Quantification of TWA levels allows physicians to track patients' responses to medications and cardiac rehabilitation.|$|E
30|$|<b>Spectral</b> <b>methods</b> are an {{efficient}} and highly accurate techniques adopted in applied mathematics and fluid dynamics to numerically solve linear and nonlinear differential equations and integral equations (see, e.g., [1 – 4] and the references therein).

The <b>spectral</b> collocation <b>method</b> offers the exponential rate of convergence as the grid is refined or the degree of the interpolation polynomial is increased.|$|R
40|$|<b>Spectral</b> <b>methods</b> {{constitute}} {{a useful tool}} in the analysis and synthesis of Boolean functions, especially in cases when other methods reduce to brute-force search procedures.

30|$|While the <b>spectral</b> <b>methods</b> do present higher {{computational}} times (Fig.  5 d, Table  1 (Time), Fig.  6 d and Table  2 (Time)), {{these times}} are still feasible. Moreover, the <b>spectral</b> <b>methods</b> {{have the upper}} hand, MSE-wise, when the data is missing in chunks and when evaluating acute exposure, i.e., max-difference and signal behavior through its standard deviation. In the cases where the simple <b>methods</b> prevail, the <b>spectral</b> <b>methods</b> do not fall far behind. Therefore, we conclude that the <b>spectral</b> <b>methods</b> in general, K-SVD and DCT in particular, do present viable tool for data imputation and should {{be used as the}} tool of choice in general as it presents the overall best performance.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Spectral</b> <b>methods</b> and {{finite element}} methods {{are closely related}} and built on the same ideas; the main {{difference}} between them is that <b>spectral</b> <b>methods</b> use basis functions that are nonzero over the whole domain, while finite element methods use basis functions that are nonzero only on small subdomains. In other words, <b>spectral</b> <b>methods</b> take on a global approach while finite element methods use a local approach.
