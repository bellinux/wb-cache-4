The theoretical part outlines the responsibilities of drivers, especially the motor vehicle documentation, scheduling and planning of the working time on the road, stacking and <b>securing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>freight</b> and, duties and responsibilities during accidents {{in relation to the}} above mentioned legal framework. All this is then related to the roadside checks that constitute a commonly used control mechanism. The analytical part consists of a one-company case study; it examines the routines and general duties <b>of</b> the road <b>freight</b> drivers <b>of</b> one Czech <b>freight</b> company using surveys and interviews with the drivers focusing on their knowledge of Czech and EU legal norms.

40|$|Freight {{transport}} {{issues at}} the city level are still not well understood {{and there is no}} widespread methodology specifically aimed at the analysis and planning <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> movements.

By this the article contributes to laying the ground for designing strategies and solutions to overcome the challenge <b>of</b> <b>securing</b> the mobility <b>of</b> goods and at the same time reducing unsustainable impacts from freight transport. Interviews with stakeholders were conducted in four cities in the Baltic Sea Region. A large quantity of local actors and stakeholders has contributed to this analysis. The study shows, that interaction and cooperation of all involved actors are necessary but lacking, including both actors from the public and private sector. Furthermore, taking into account freight transport’s growing contribution to the negative impacts, compared to passenger transport, city authorities need more capacity and competence within this area...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} the {{liability}} <b>of</b> the <b>freight</b> forwarders according to national and international law. The liability <b>of</b> the <b>freight</b> forwarder is an extremely complex issue for theoretical examination. The latter is especially case considering the process of complete transformation <b>of</b> the <b>freight</b> forwarder position that freight forwarders experienced {{in the last decade}} of 21 -st century. Considering the fact that process <b>of</b> transformation <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> forwar-ders position imposed a new terminology determinant - logistic operators, in this paper we use the term freight forwarders, and emphasize that the subject of examination is conventional/classical freight forwarders. Theoretical examination <b>of</b> the <b>freight</b> forwarder status is vital for clarification of many practical dilemmas and disputes in logistic sector. The determination <b>of</b> the <b>freight</b> forwarders liability is aimed at reducing of judical and arbitral disputes in Macedonian practice, and analysis of the legal regime <b>of</b> the <b>freight</b> forwarder’s liability in the context of international shiiping, which present the main goal of this paper. The clarification <b>of</b> the <b>freight</b> forwarders liability is closely related to the determination <b>of</b> the <b>freight</b> forwarder position towards his principal and the third party in the obligation.

It has been found that the key business-indicators of the diagnosis system of transport activity as a component of the enterprise logistical system are: the coefficient <b>of</b> timeliness <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> transportation (delivery); coefficient of completeness of transportation; coefficient <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> safety conditions; coefficient <b>of</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> transportation; coefficient <b>of</b> complexity <b>of</b> servicing <b>freight</b> owners; coefficient <b>of</b> satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> owners’ demand, coefficient of readiness to operation of transport facilities per working day; coefficient of using vehicle kilometers travelled; coefficient of extensity of transport facility packing...|$|R
