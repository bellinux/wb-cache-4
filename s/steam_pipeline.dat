40|$|This master’s thesis {{focuses on}} the design of steam {{condensate}} system of steam power plants. Condensate is generated when fractions of extracted steam from the turbine transfer heat to feedwater in the feedwater heaters. Also small amounts of condensate form in <b>steam</b> <b>pipelines</b> due to radiation heat loss. The condensate produced in the steam using equipment and pipelines should be removed as quickly as possible in order to avoid various problems, such as fractures in pipeline fittings, loss of live steam and so forth. The recovered condensate is treated water containing sensible heat that accounts for approximately 10 % to 30 % of the total heat contained by the live steam. Thus the boiler fuel demand can be potentially reduced from 10 % to 20 % by economically recovering hot condensate. The proper design of condensate system requires detail knowledge about condensate piping network, different components of the system as well as various problems associated with condensate flow both in <b>steam</b> and condensate <b>pipelines.</b> In this study, major components of steam condensate system are presented, followed by a discussion of most common problems with condensate, such as water hammer, flash steam, pipe erosion and so on. For optimum design of steam condensate system, the study highlights recommendations for the slope of horizontal <b>steam</b> and condensate <b>pipelines,</b> analysis of condensate flow behaviour in upward inclined steam pipes, sizing of components, such as drain pockets, discharge lines from steam traps, and the importance of using different components in steam condensate system...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems affecting geothermal fields is the abatement of hydrogen chloride contained in the vapor phase.

30|$|A {{solution}} {{like this}} has many advantages because a substantial rise in the temperature of steam, especially reheated steam, increases {{the problem of the}} difference between the bleed steam and the saturation temperatures in regenerative heaters fed with bleeds from the intermediate-pressure turbine, which are situated right after the steam reheater. This causes material and thermodynamic problems because, with the rise in the mean difference in temperature of the heat-exchanging agents, the exergy losses rise too which leads to a reduction in the process effectiveness and to an increase in the heating steam consumption. By keeping pressures in the bleeds of the auxiliary turbine at the same level as in the intermediate-pressure turbine, the temperature difference in the exchangers will be much lower (the outlet of this turbine is even in the area of saturated steam). Another advantage of the master cycle is that the construction of an intermediate-pressure turbine without bleeds is much simpler and cheaper. This is essential in view of the need to use expensive construction materials. Lower temperatures of the steam in the bleeds from the driving turbine, compared to the intermediate-pressure turbine, result in an increase in the mass flow from them. This causes a reduction in the steam mass flow to the reheater, i.e., lower costs of the reheated <b>steam</b> <b>pipelines</b> and of the reheater in the boiler. The steam mass flow from the main turbine into the condenser is also smaller which decreases heat losses of the cycle.|$|R
