50|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{important}} aspect of the ISDA Master Agreement is that the Master Agreement and all the Confirmations entered into under it form a single agreement. This is very important (especially for regulated financial companies) as it allows the parties to an ISDA Master Agreement to aggregate the amounts owing by each of them under all of the Transactions outstanding under that ISDA Master Agreement and replace them with a <b>single</b> <b>net</b> <b>amount</b> payable by one party to the other. Netting, dealt with under section 2(c) of the ISDA Master Agreement, allows the parties to net out amounts payable on the same day and in the same currency.|$|E

Results: In general, it is suggested to use the multinet Bayesian network framework for predictive medicine instead of the <b>single</b> <b>net</b> Bayesian network, because for large numbers of samples and features, it is highly likely {{that it is the}} stronger predictor, and for smaller numbers of samples and features, if the multinet returns good results, {{it is likely to be}} a better predictor than the <b>single</b> <b>net</b> Bayesian network. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{one theory}} of life {{insurance}}, needs based analysis, life insurance is only needed {{to the extent}} that assets left behind by a person will not be enough to meet the income and capital needs of his or her dependents. In one form of variable universal life insurance, the cost of insurance purchased is based only on the difference between the death benefit and the cash value (defined as the <b>net</b> <b>amount</b> at risk {{from the perspective of the}} insurer). Therefore, the greater the cash value accumulation, the lesser the <b>net</b> <b>amount</b> at risk, and the less insurance that is purchased.|$|R

Such complexes are thought to play important roles in the apical positioning and regulated endocytosis of NaPi-IIa and therefore such interactions have to be considered when explaining proximal phosphate ion reabsorption...|$|R
