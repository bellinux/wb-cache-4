5|$|A <b>support</b> <b>wall</b> {{was built}} at Sørlia, {{just south of}} Steinkjer, after there was a clay landslide. Construction of the bridge over Figgja, just south of Steinkjer, was {{performed}} in 1904. The superstructure was built by Kværner of Oslo and installed between 11 November and 21 December 1904. The bridge over Steinkjerelva took up {{a significant portion of}} the old river port in Steinkjer, resulting in a spur being built to a new port location. The railway ran right through the town center, forcing 20 houses to be demolished and splitting the town in two. The arrival and route of the railway was described by some locals as vandalism. A counter-proposal which saw the line run further up and cross through Steinkjersannan and Furuskogen—and thus avoid the town itself—was discarded because it would wreck the military camp at Steinkjersannan and would be located too far from the port. There was also a major debate as to whether the station should be on the south side or north side of the river. The municipal council voted for the south side with the mayor's double vote being decisive. Construction of the bridge over Steinkjerelva started in August 1902 and was completed on 7 May 1904. A proposal to build the bridge as a swing bridge was dropped, forcing the railways to pay NOK45,402 in compensation to companies with facilities upstream.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2009, with {{unemployment}} at 9.5% and climbing, Warsh {{argued that}} the Fed should begin to pull back on its efforts to help the real economy recover: [...] "if policymakers insist on waiting until the level of real activity has plainly and substantially returned to normal — and the economy has returned to self-sustaining trend growth — they will almost certainly have waited too long… There is a risk, of much debated magnitude, that the unusually high level of reserves, along with substantial liquid assets of the banking system, could fuel an unanticipated, excessive surge in lending." [...] The runaway inflation he warned about never appeared. University of Oregon Professor Tim Duy wrote {{in response to the}} speech that it looked as though [...] "monetary policymakers are more willing to use unconventional monetary policy to <b>support</b> <b>Wall</b> Street than Main Street." ...|$|E
2500|$|The visible {{ruins of}} the walled village or hill fort {{includes}} a plan of great dimensions with four lines of walls and approximately oval shape. The main platform covers [...] area of 24 hectares, following along two principal axis. The defensive ramparts includes a partially maintained fourth line {{to the north and}} a pair of moats. The preserved walls measure [...] thick and less than [...] high; a portion of the wall was restored by Martins Sarmento that measures almost [...] high. The walls were built using irregular dry stone masonry methods, edged on both sides. The innermost rampart was partially absorbed into the urban development by being incorporated as a <b>support</b> <b>wall</b> for several family compounds. Gates were cut through each of the ramparts to provide passage; some of the gate openings still have hollows where palisades were placed. Ramps and stairs providing access {{to the top of the}} third rampart are evident.|$|E

6000|$|... § IX. The second kind of superimposition, {{lightness}} on weight, is, in {{its most}} necessary use, of stories of houses one upon another, where, of course, wall veil is required in the lower ones, and has to <b>support</b> <b>wall</b> veil above, aided by as much of shaft structure as is attainable within the given limits. The greatest, if not the only, merit of the Roman and Renaissance Venetian architects is their graceful management {{of this kind of}} superimposition; sometimes of complete courses of external arches and shafts one above the other; sometimes of apertures with intermediate cornices at the levels of the floors, and large shafts from top to bottom of the building; always observing that the upper stories shall be at once lighter and richer than the lower ones. The entire value of such buildings depends upon the perfect and easy expression of the relative strength of the stories, and the unity obtained by the varieties of their proportions, while yet the fact of superimposition and separation by floors is frankly told.|$|E

50|$|Architectural Structures such as {{walls and}} {{ceilings}} are typical supports for fresco and mural style paintings. Preserving the both the paint layer and the <b>support</b> (<b>wall)</b> is crucial. Regular {{maintenance of the}} building and structure is necessary to safeguarding wall paintings. Monitoring environmental conditions, limiting visitor access, and temporary closures to public access can be used to help preserve the paintings. Conservation treatments may take the form of reconstruction using traditional materials and techniques, and complete or partial coverings with protective layers.|$|E
50|$|Wall {{is the son}} of Frances Pulley and John Carroll Wall, Sr. When Wall was 8 years old, {{his father}} was {{released}} from prison but died of liver cancer a month later, on August 24, 1999 at the age of 52. Throughout his childhood, Wall's mother worked multiple jobs to <b>support</b> <b>Wall,</b> his sister, Cierra, and his half-sister, Tonya. Wall's father was incarcerated due to the armed robbery of a convenience store and had served time earlier for second-degree murder.|$|E
5000|$|The church {{stands on}} a small hill in the Murova neighborhood, the town's {{historic}} core, and is dedicated to Saint Leonard of Noblac. It is first mentioned in documents dating to 1460 and was originally dedicated to Mary Magdalene. The original Gothic church had a rectangular nave and pentagonal presbytery, and was surrounded with a defensive wall, fortified with three square towers, one of which partially survives in the southern <b>support</b> <b>wall.</b> It {{was built in the}} mid 15th century and has its first major rebuilding in 1524 and was remodelled in the Baroque style in the early 18th century.|$|E

5000|$|While Valley Parade was re-developed, Bradford City played {{games at}} various {{neighbouring}} grounds: Elland Road, Leeds; Leeds Road, Huddersfield; and Odsal Stadium, Bradford. Valley Parade re-opened on 14 December 1986, when Bradford City beat an England XI 2-1 in a friendly. Since then, {{it has been}} further re-developed and, today, Valley Parade is a modern 25,136 all-seater stadium, which is virtually unrecognisable from how {{it was at the}} time of the disaster, save for the original [...] that still stands beside the main stand, and the flank <b>support</b> <b>wall</b> that runs down the Hollywell Ash Lane at the [...] "Bradford End".|$|E
50|$|Between 1965 and 1966, {{the support}} walls, churchyard spaces and {{staircase}} were defined and expanded, {{which included the}} reinforcement of the northern, southern and western limits with cap-stone and erecting an eastern fence. The project also involved the cleaning and repair of the staircase access to the main chapel and removal of rubble from the doorway and cracks in the walls, doors, window frames and spaces. These improvements lead to the installation of exterior illumination in 1967 to attract tourism. Reconstruction of the <b>support</b> <b>wall,</b> the roofing, construction of interior doorways and painting of the exterior doors were completed {{at the beginning of}} 1970. Similar cleaning and lateral door replacement occurred by the end of 1979.|$|E
50|$|The {{renovation}} of the Altenburg-Paditz section, which is about four kilometers long, was completed on 25 November 2013 {{after more than two}} years of construction; this work included the restoration of operations on two tracks. Since the summer of 2011, around €36 m have been invested {{and at the same time}} about 8 kilometres of track have been renewed; 11 kilometres were fully reconstructed and four railway overpasses and one road overpass as well as two culverts were built. In the area of the former Altenburg tunnel, about 1000 metres of <b>support</b> <b>wall</b> and 500 metres of trough construction were built. In the future trains in this section will be able to operate at up to 150 km/h.|$|E

40|$|Analyzes of {{influence}} of the point thermal bridges of buildings with ventilated facade systems on the thermal properties of envelops are presented in the paper. The relation between the separate components of the envelop were made: thermal properties and thickness of <b>supporting</b> <b>wall's</b> layer; value of thermal conductivity and thickness of insulation layer. Studies have shown, {{that the value of}} the point thermal transmittance, which depended on the thermal properties of the envelop and thickness of the layers, might increase to 35 %. The higher thermal conductivity coefficient of the material of the <b>supporting</b> <b>wall</b> and thickness of the insulation layer, the larger value the point thermal transmittance. And contrary, if the thickness of the <b>supporting</b> <b>wall</b> and coefficient of thermal conductivity of insulation layer was increased, the value the point thermal transmittance was decreased. It is possible to determine the value of thermal bridges of certain construction design solution by simplified calculations, according to the existing dependencies formulas or graphics. In this case it's necessary to have dependence of the point thermal bridges from thermal insulation properties and dimensions of envelop layers...|$|R
