25|$|Over time, {{however, the}} {{pheromone}} trail starts to evaporate, thus reducing its attractive strength. The more {{time it takes}} for an ant to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. A short path, by comparison, gets marched over more frequently, and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones. Pheromone evaporation also has the advantage of avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution. If there were no evaporation at all, the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones. In that case, the exploration of the <b>solution</b> <b>space</b> would be constrained. The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear, but it is very important in artificial systems.|$|E

25|$|This {{notion of}} slow cooling {{implemented}} in the Simulated Annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the <b>solution</b> <b>space</b> is explored. Accepting worse solutions is a fundamental property of metaheuristics because it allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. In general, the Simulated Annealing algorithms work as follows. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and then decides to move to it or {{to stay with the}} current solution based on either one of two probabilities between which it chooses {{on the basis of the}} fact that the new solution is better or worse than the current one. During the search, the temperature is progressively decreased from an initial positive value to zero and affects the two probabilities: at each step, the probability of moving to a better new solution is either kept to 1 or is changed towards a positive value; instead, the probability of moving to a worse new solution is progressively changed towards zero.|$|E

2500|$|A {{key part}} of FBA {{is the ability to}} add {{constraints}} to the flux rates of reactions within networks, forcing them to stay within a range of selected values. This lets the model more accurately simulate real metabolism. The constraints belong to two subsets from a biological perspective; boundary constraints that limit nutrient uptake/excretion and internal constraints that limit the flux through reactions within the organism. [...] In mathematical terms, the application of constraints can be considered to reduce the <b>solution</b> <b>space</b> of the FBA model. In addition to constraints applied at the edges of a metabolic network, constraints can be applied to reactions deep within the network. These constraints are usually simple; they may constrain the direction of a reaction due to energy considerations or constrain the maximum speed of a reaction due to the finite speed of all reactions in nature.|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, every median graph {{must be the}} retract of a hypercube. [...] This may be {{seen from}} the connection, {{described}} above, between median graphs and 2-satisfiability: let G be the graph of solutions to a 2-satisfiability instance; without loss of generality this instance can be formulated {{in such a way that}} no two variables are always equal or always unequal in every solution. [...] Then the space of all truth assignments to the variables of this instance forms a hypercube. [...] For each clause, formed as the disjunction of two variables or their complements, in the 2-satisfiability instance, one can form a retraction of the hypercube in which truth assignments violating this clause are mapped to truth assignments in which both variables satisfy the clause, without changing the other variables in the truth assignment. [...] The composition of the retractions formed in this way for each of the clauses gives a retraction of the hypercube onto the <b>solution</b> <b>space</b> of the instance, and therefore gives a representation of G as the retract of a hypercube. [...] In particular, median graphs are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes, and are therefore partial cubes.
