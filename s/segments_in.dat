5|$|Grasshoppers may be {{confused}} with Ensifera (crickets, etc.), but they differ in many aspects; these include the number of <b>segments</b> <b>in</b> their antennae {{and the structure of}} the ovipositor, as well as the location of the tympanal organ and the methods by which sound is produced. Ensiferans have antennae that can be much longer than the body and have at least 20–24 segments, while caeliferans have fewer <b>segments</b> <b>in</b> their shorter, stouter antennae.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen shows {{considerable}} variability {{among members}} of the order. It consists of eleven <b>segments</b> <b>in</b> primitive groups and ten <b>segments</b> <b>in</b> more derived groups, the tenth and eleventh segments having fused. The last two or three segments are adapted for reproduction. Each segment is made up of a dorsal and a ventral sclerite, connected by an elastic membrane. In some females, the sclerites are rolled into a flexible, telescopic ovipositor.|$|E
5|$|One {{potentially}} distinguishing {{character is}} {{the shape of}} the ultimate <b>segments</b> <b>in</b> the middle part of the leaf blade, which are oblong in A.pedatum and long-triangular or reniform (kidney-shaped) in A.viridimontanum and some specimens of A.aleuticum. Furthermore, A.viridimontanum can grow in both shade and sun, while A.pedatum grows in shade only.|$|E
30|$|Hayakawa et al. (2002) {{identified}} similar structural {{differences between}} segments A and B by a wide-angle seismic structure study along profile NS 1999. They showed that (i) the sedimentary layers were thicker <b>in</b> <b>segment</b> B than <b>in</b> <b>segment</b> A, (ii) the forearc crust was thinner <b>in</b> <b>segment</b> B than <b>in</b> <b>segment</b> A, and (iii) the forearc Moho was remarkably shallower <b>in</b> <b>segment</b> B than <b>in</b> <b>segment</b> A.|$|R
30|$|The seismic {{moments of}} each {{behavioral}} <b>segment</b> <b>in</b> the model 16 {{are larger than}} those obtained by applying the empirical relationship to the rupture area of the segment. If the empirical relationship between seismic moment and rupture area is satisfied for each behavioral <b>segment</b> <b>in</b> a single-segment rupture, our result may mean that the slip of each <b>segment</b> <b>in</b> a multi-segment rupture {{is different from that}} in a single-segment rupture.|$|R

5|$|Ants are {{distinct}} in their morphology from other insects in having elbowed antennae, metapleural glands, {{and a strong}} constriction of their second abdominal segment into a node-like petiole. The head, mesosoma, and metasoma are the three distinct body segments. The petiole forms a narrow waist between their mesosoma (thorax plus the first abdominal segment, which is fused to it) and gaster (abdomen less the abdominal <b>segments</b> <b>in</b> the petiole). The petiole may be formed by one or two nodes (the second alone, or {{the second and third}} abdominal segments).|$|E

5|$|However, the 2000s housing bubble {{that drove}} {{significant}} growth of Poinciana collapsed and Avatar {{was unable to}} justify the costs or finance construction of the highway. Around 2010, Avatar decided not to build the highway {{while at the same}} time, the state established the Osceola County Expressway Authority (OCX) to develop and built a series of toll road <b>segments</b> <b>in</b> Osceola County. The 2040 Master Plan developed by OCX has a loop route around the south and east sides of the Kissimmee-St.Cloud area. The Poinciana Parkway is a natural part of the proposed loop road.|$|E
5|$|Kid Icarus: Uprising {{takes place}} in a setting based loosely around Greek mythology. The main protagonist is the angel Pit, servant of the Goddess of Light Palutena. When the Goddess of Darkness Medusa returns to destroy humanity, Pit goes on {{missions}} first against her, then against the forces of Hades, Lord of the Underworld and the source behind Medusa's return. During gameplay, players control Pit during airborne rail shooter segments and ground-based third-person shooter <b>segments.</b> <b>In</b> addition to the single-player campaign, multiple multiplayer modes are available, with competitive modes available for up to six players.|$|E
5|$|Announced in May 2014, {{development}} on Far Cry 4 began {{immediately after the}} shipment of Assassin's Creed III in late 2012. The team originally intended to develop a direct sequel to Far Cry 3 that continues 3s story, but the idea was later scrapped and the team decided {{to develop a new}} setting and new story for the game. Certain aspects of Far Cry 4 were inspired by the Nepalese Civil War, and the costume of the game's antagonist Pagan Min was inspired by Japanese films Ichi the Killer and Brother. The game's competitive multiplayer was created by Red Storm Entertainment while the Shangri-La <b>segments</b> <b>in</b> the campaign were handled by Ubisoft Toronto.|$|E
40|$|It is {{concluded}} that the ductus epididymidis of the echidna is divided into only two structurally distinct segments which are each homogeneous along their length. The initial <b>segment</b> <b>in</b> the echidna is structurally {{very similar to the}} initial <b>segment</b> proper <b>in</b> the epididymis of all other mammals which have been studied, whereas the terminal segment is structurally quite different from the terminal <b>segment</b> <b>in</b> other mammals. The terminal <b>segment</b> <b>in</b> the echidna is involved in considerable apocrine secretion of highly membranous material. The secretions gradually degenerate and occupy {{a large proportion of the}} lumen of the duct...|$|R

5|$|As the Osiris myth first {{appears in}} the Pyramid Texts, most of its {{essential}} features must have taken shape sometime before the texts were written down. The distinct segments of the story—Osiris's death and restoration, Horus's childhood, and Horus's conflict with Set—may originally have been independent mythic episodes. If so, they must have begun to coalesce into a single story {{by the time of}} the Pyramid Texts, which loosely connect those <b>segments.</b> <b>In</b> any case, the myth was inspired by a variety of influences. Much of the story is based in religious ideas and the general nature of Egyptian society: the divine nature of kingship, the succession from one king to another, the struggle to maintain maat, and the effort to overcome death. For instance, the lamentations of Isis and Nephthys for their dead brother may represent an early tradition of ritualized mourning.|$|E
5|$|Bradley Meek, {{writing for}} THEM Anime, gave the series 3/5 stars. He praised {{the way the}} series {{maintained}} its horror-based atmosphere in between the action sequences. He greatly enjoyed the horror and action aspects, but felt that the character-driven <b>segments</b> <b>in</b> early episodes threatened to drag down the whole experience due to mundane content and poor characters. Talking about the anime's second half, {{he said that it}} drastically altered the pace and content to the point that viewers might be put off with its conscious bending of the rules of handling characters and viewers alike—Meek was ultimately angry at the series' brutal ending, but it also left him eager to see its movie conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Every {{character}} {{has been given}} their own unique ability. For example, Jazz can fire a grappling hook to reach high or distant places, Optimus Prime can command the massive Metroplex, and the Combaticons {{have the ability to}} combine into the Decepticon Bruticus. <b>Segments</b> <b>in</b> which players control Bruticus are designed to accommodate its larger size. Scale is maintained so the character towers over enemies. The Autobot Grimlock, who transforms into a dinosaur, is controlled differently than other characters. Carrying only a sword and shield, Grimlock cannot transform at will, instead accumulating rage as he battles opponents. When he gains enough rage, Grimlock is able to transform and inflict massive damage. The online cooperative campaign play featured in the first game has been removed in favor of levels that utilize each character's specific abilities.|$|E

5|$|I-75 {{has five}} named <b>segments</b> <b>in</b> Michigan. The {{southern}}most section {{from the state}} line north to the Detroit area is the Detroit–Toledo Expressway. The segment through southern and central Detroit {{is known as the}} Fisher Freeway. It was dedicated on September 17, 1970, to the Fisher Brothers, who founded Fisher Body, later a part of General Motors. After the curve in downtown Detroit, I-75 follows the Walter P. Chrysler Freeway northward. That segment is named for Walter P. Chrysler, founder of Chrysler. The name was chosen by the Detroit Common Council on November 6, 1957, and codified in state law in 1990; the state definition for the name places the northern end of the designation at the Oakland–Genesee county line.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, US 98 {{replaced}} the MS 24 designation from US 51 in McComb to east of McLain; as a result, MS 24 was {{split into two}} <b>segments.</b> <b>In</b> 1957, the paved portion of MS 24 west of Woodville was extended further to the west. The eastern segment of MS 24 between McLain and the Alabama border was redesignated as MS 594 in 1958. In 1962, the highway was paved to a point east of Fort Adams. Paving was completed on the remainder of MS 24 leading to Fort Adams in 1964. In 1967, the eastern terminus of MS 24 was truncated to its current location at the interchange with I-55; US 98 {{replaced the}} route between there and US 51. Since then, MS 24 has remained on the same alignment.|$|E
5|$|In Flow, {{the player}} guides a small, multi-segmented worm- or snake-like {{creature}} through an aquatic environment. There are no menus or guidelines; the game begins immediately. The game world, which is viewed from a top-down perspective, consists of two-dimensional planes stacked vertically upon each other. A blurred {{version of the}} layer below appears {{in the background of}} each plane. Planes contain organisms of varying sizes; the player's creature automatically attempts to consume them when they are nearby. The majority of these creatures are non-confrontational, and are composed of cells that increase the number of <b>segments</b> <b>in</b> the player's creature when eaten. All planes, except for the highest and lowest, contain two specially colored organisms that move the player's creature up or down one plane when touched.|$|E

5|$|In its 2014 {{edition of}} the Technology Roadmap: Solar Photovoltaic Energy report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) {{published}} prices for residential, commercial and utility-scale PV systems for eight major markets as of 2013 (see table below). However, DOE's SunShot Initiative has reported much lower U.S. installation prices. In 2014, prices continued to decline. The SunShot Initiative modeled U.S. system prices {{to be in the}} range of $1.80 to $3.29 per watt. Other sources identify similar price ranges of $1.70 to $3.50 for the different market <b>segments</b> <b>in</b> the U.S., and in the highly penetrated German market, prices for residential and small commercial rooftop systems of up to 100kW declined to $1.36 per watt (€1.24/W) by the end of 2014. In 2015, Deutsche Bank estimated costs for small residential rooftop systems in the U.S. around $2.90 per watt. Costs for utility-scale systems in China and India were estimated as low as $1.00 per watt.|$|E
5|$|Kumbakonam {{is a part}} of the Kumbakonam Legislative Assembly {{constituency}} and elects {{a member}} to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly once every five years. Despite being a hub of militant Communism in the 1950s, Kumbakonam voted for the Indian National Congress in the first five state elections held between 1952 and 1977. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam won the elections in 1977 and between 1977 and 1989, the seat was alternatively held by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam or the Indian National Congress. Since 1989, barring an interregnum of five years between 1991 and 1996, the seat has been held by Ko. Si. Mani of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Kumbakonam was a part of the Kumbakonam Lok Sabha constituency from 1952 till 1977, when the constituency was disbanded.
