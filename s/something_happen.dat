25|$|Secret {{investigations}} into Panday began after the 2001 election, when the Central Authority and the Anti Corruption Bureau {{was set up}} by the PNM. On September 18, 2002, Panday was charged under section 27(1)(b) of the Integrity in Public Life Act No. 8 of 1987 for failing to declare the contents of a bank account in London for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999. During the investigation, he had first stated that the funds in the account were for his children's education and that his name was added to the account to prevent problems should <b>something</b> <b>happen</b> to his wife. He did not consider the funds his own, and thus did not declare them. However, after receiving further information from the bank, he stated that the account had been opened jointly with his wife to deposit money for his open heart surgery. After his wife transferred the account to another branch she maintained and administered it, and his name remained on it out of convenience.|$|E
25|$|An oral {{tale about}} the shava sadhana is {{told by the}} Tantrikas of Bengal. Vasudeva Bhattacharya of Tipperah (West Bengal) went to the Goddess temple of Kamakhya and worshipped the deity by Tantric means. A voice {{told him about the}} ritual and that he will gain moksha in his next life when he will be reborn as his own {{grandson}} Sarvananda. Vasudeva gave his servant Purvananda an engraved copper plate with a mantra. Purvananda, now an old man, now served Sarvananda, who he passed the secret of shava sadhana ritual, told by his former master. Purvananda volunteered to be used as the corpse for shava sadhana and Sarvananda performed the ritual, where ghosts tormented him; storms tried to interrupt his practice; beautiful dancers tempted him, until the Goddess gave him a vision. She blessed him with vak siddhi, the ability to make <b>something</b> <b>happen</b> by just saying it. She also revived the servant. Sarvananda became a siddha and the first tantrika to see the theophany of the Goddess' ten mahavidya forms. The Shakta poet Ramprasad Sen is also told to have performed the ritual and gained the vision of his patron, goddess Kali.|$|E

[...] Chambers has described this plot strand as portraying Sam [...] "(bending) the rules to make <b>something</b> <b>happen</b> [...] It's yet another example of Sam not thinking about the repercussions of his actions." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{stage is}} made entirely of {{unfinished}} hinoki, Japanese cypress, {{with almost no}} decorative elements. The poet and novelist Tōson Shimazaki writes that [...] "on {{the stage of the}} Noh theatre there are no sets that change with each piece. Neither is there a curtain. There is only a simple panel (kagami-ita) with a painting of a green pine tree. This creates the impression that anything that could provide any shading has been banished.

Nansen attempted to start a newspaper, but the project soon fizzled out through lack of interest. Small tasks were undertaken and scientific observations maintained, {{but there was no}} urgency. Nansen expressed his frustration in his journal: [...] "I feel I must break through this deadness, this inertia, and find some outlet for my energies."

500|$|The film {{received}} mixed reviews, {{but also}} criticism for {{several aspects of}} the production. The Morning Telegraph stated, [...] "The photography {{at the beginning of}} the film is poor. It seems queer that the child should be able to escape from the orphan asylum in such an easy manner and that no search be made by the institution. It seemed very theatrical and hardly possible that the child should make the first stop at the house of the father's intended. Why did not the producer have the child make a few more stops or have <b>something</b> <b>happen</b> to her instead of making the first stop at the woman's house?" [...] The Moving Picture World spared little coverage of the actual film in its review, noting that the emotional story might be a plausible. The New York Dramatic Mirror gave a detailed review that found the acting favorable, but found the plot and its resolution to be fantastical by stating, [...] "The manifest absurdity of this plot lies in the adoption. No girl just betrothed would ever adopt a runaway orphan." ...|$|E

I was trying to make <b>something</b> <b>happen</b> and got in the wall which ended up killing our car. The good part about that is I was able to save fuel because there was no pressure from behind. I was able to save fuel and our Camry got the best fuel mileage it got all day." [...] Kyle Busch's crew chief Dave Rogers said of his drivers' performance, [...] "I think he handled it well -- it's tough. You lead all these laps and he could have gone for the clean sweep this weekend -- win all three in a row. He deserved to win all three in a row and to get beat -- it's tough.", he continued, [...] "We're disappointed -- this Toyota deserved to be in Victory Lane. I thought we had one of the best cars throughout the entire race, but it just didn't work out that way. We were a little short on fuel." ...|$|E
