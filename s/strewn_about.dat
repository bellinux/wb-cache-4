5|$|In the Summer of 1999, a {{group of}} volunteers worked to restore and clean up the {{cemetery}} {{that led to a}} ceremony in October 1999 with more than 60 people in attendance. The article in The Day highlighted the difficulty in finding the cemetery which is located {{on the banks of the}} Pachaug River, in the village of Glasgo, located in the town of Griswold. Iva Arpin said that the town would repair the stone walls and that the Children of the American Revolution would return in the spring to continue their work on the cemetery. In 2002, the cemetery had undergone a significant restoration which included the unearthing and accounting for all the burial markers that had been <b>strewn</b> <b>about</b> the grounds. Arpin noted that some of the stones showed signs of vandalism. The Day described how some of the marker stones and monuments were covered in nearly a foot of pine needles and that the roots had uprooted the anchor stones causing the headstones to fall and break.|$|E
5|$|Rima Hadley, a sinuous rille located {{west of the}} Apollo 15 landing site, {{begins in}} an area of low domes at an {{elongated}} crater, Běla, and runs on to the North along the Apennine Mountain Range. Some research has suggested that both the rille and Běla are volcanic vents, and lava flows created the features. Another hypothesis suggests that the rille was originally an underground lava tube, the roof of which collapsed, creating the current appearance of the rille. Several large boulders, some of which are as large as houses, are <b>strewn</b> <b>about</b> the feature's floor. The elongated crater Běla, which forms the beginning of Rima Hadley, could have been formed by the collapse of a shallow magma chamber. Visual observation suggests that the same is the case with other lunar rilles with similar features at their beginnings.|$|E

25|$|In {{the typical}} form of her myth, Isis {{was the first}} {{daughter}} of Geb, god of the Earth, and Nut, goddess of the Sky, and she was {{born on the fourth}} intercalary day. She married her brother, Osiris, and she conceived Horus with him. Isis was instrumental in the resurrection of Osiris when he was murdered by Set. Using her magical skills, she restored his body to life after having gathered the body parts that had been <b>strewn</b> <b>about</b> the earth by Set.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the same}} time, a retired Siemens {{engineer}} named Franz Selinger, who {{was writing a}} history of the company, went through Sommermeyer's papers and learned of the station's existence. He contacted Canadian Department of National Defence historian W.A.B. Douglas, who went to the site with a team in 1981 and found the station still there, although canisters had been opened and components <b>strewn</b> <b>about</b> the site. Weather Station Kurt was brought to Ottawa and is now on display at the Canadian War Museum.|$|E
25|$|At 12:02p.m., Harris and Klebold {{returned}} to the library. This was 20 minutes after their lethal shooting spree had ended, leaving 12 students dead, one teacher dying, and another 24 students and staff injured. Ten of their victims {{had been killed in}} the library, with their bodies <b>strewn</b> <b>about</b> the floor. Harris and Klebold went to the west windows and opened fire on the police outside. Six minutes later, they walked to the bookshelves near a table where Patrick Ireland lay badly-wounded and unconscious. Student Lisa Kreutz, injured in the earlier library attack, was also in the room, unable to move.|$|E

50|$|The many monstrous statues {{appear to}} be {{unconnected}} to any rational plan and {{appear to have been}} <b>strewn</b> almost randomly <b>about</b> the area, sol per sfogare il Core ("just to set the heart free") as one inscription on an obelisk says.|$|R
60|$|The {{shutters}} of {{the window}} were closed, but enough light streamed through the chinks and crevices {{for them to see}} dimly. There was odd rubbish <b>strewn</b> all <b>about,</b> and in one corner a heap of decaying sacks. To these both rushed, and threw some on the floor by the door, placing their feet on them to keep them firm, just as with a rush the men came against it. This door was far stronger than the one below, but it gave before the weight.|$|R
25|$|As {{the gang}} rallies for an all-out final assault, Wilson, Leigh, and Bishop {{retreat to the}} basement, taking the still-catatonic Lawson with them. Protected by a large durable sign, the gang then storms the {{building}} and rush the survivors. Bishop shoots a tank full of acetylene gas, which explodes and kills all the gang members in the basement. The remaining gang members retreat as more police support arrives to secure the station. Venturing down into the basement, the police officers find dozens of badly burned and killed gang members <b>strewn</b> <b>about</b> the hallway; the only survivors are Bishop, Leigh, Wilson, and Lawson. An officer tries to cuff Wilson, but Bishop angrily stops him and asks Wilson {{to walk out of}} the station with him.|$|E
25|$|Records {{show that}} by the 1790s, there were seven {{different}} slave families represented at Poplar Forest. Jefferson encouraged common-law unions amongst the slaves, and recorded the birth dates of each slave born on the property. He also rewarded women who married a fellow slave from Poplar Forest with a pot; archaeologists have found remnants of these gifts in archaeological studies of the property. Jefferson kept records of family connections - surviving records have allowed scholars to conclude that multiple generations of single families were enslaved at Poplar Forest and had relatives <b>strewn</b> <b>about</b> other plantations in Virginia. William and Marian Cobbs inherited a slave family that included Mary and her daughters Lucy and Matilda (who are recorded to have worked as house servants) {{as well as other}} siblings and extended family members.|$|E
25|$|At 6:00 AM on {{the morning}} of November 16, the Vigilant {{launched}} a boat manned by marines to haul down the American flag, which had been left flying. Two hours later, Osborn's troops landed amid snow flurries and took possession of the ruined fort. They were greeted by a lone American deserter who told them that Thayer's men suffered about 50 killed and 70 to 80 wounded. Historian Mark M. Boatner III estimated total American casualties at 250 from a garrison that counted 450 men plus reinforcements. British losses in the last phase of the siege were seven killed and five wounded. The victors were appalled at the damage and at the blood and brains <b>strewn</b> <b>about</b> the fort's interior. While the needy enlisted men were busy looting the corpses for shoes and clothing, a few of the British officers admitted in their letters that the defenders had been brave.|$|E
60|$|We came to {{the cliffs}} beside the little river where it empties into the bay with the great inland sea beyond. The cliffs were weather-worn and rotted, and in one place a deep hollow ran back beneath the {{overhanging}} stone for several feet, suggesting shelter for the night. There were loose rocks <b>strewn</b> all <b>about</b> with which I might build a barricade across {{the entrance to the}} cave, and so I halted there and pointed out the place to Ajor, trying to make her understand that we would spend the night there.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{having left}} the tent behind, he carried his {{blankets}} {{away from the}} fire, and rolled himself up in them between two great fir-roots that afforded concealment as well as shelter. Though he had <b>strewn</b> them <b>about</b> the blaze the blankets were still clammy, but he drew the damp folds about him uncomplainingly, and lay down with the rifle at his side. Ten minutes passed. The fire snapped and crackled, the growl of the rapid rose and fell fitfully, but the worn-out man heard neither, for he was sleeping heavily.|$|R
5000|$|An EF5 tornado {{struck the}} city on April 27, 2011, leaving 25 fatalities. It {{initially}} touched down 10 mi to the southwest in Lakeview, causing structural damage to small buildings and snapping trees. It grew in intensity, and the path width increased from around fifty yards to a half a mile, as the rotation entered the Rainsville and Sylvania communities. Damage included houses that were completely removed from foundations and debris scattered for about one mile, trees debarked, and a few mobile homes were destroyed with debris <b>strewn</b> for <b>about</b> a mile downstream. In Sylvania, some of these houses removed from foundations contained anchor bolts and foundation straps.|$|R
25|$|Annoyed at Sir Eglamour’s success, {{the next}} task that the earl gives his daughter’s suitor {{is to kill}} the Boar of Sidon, a dreadful beast that has laid waste to the area where it lives. Sir Eglamour spends a month {{travelling}} out to Sidon where he locates this boar by seeing all the bodies of dead men <b>strewn</b> <b>about</b> the ground; in a scene that is perhaps mimicked by one featuring a Rabbit of Caerbannog in the irreverent Monty Python movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail. After a struggle with this boar that lasts for three days, Sir Eglamour kills the ferocious creature. His feat of bravery and skill-at-arms is noticed by the King of Sidon, who is riding nearby {{on the day that}} Sir Eglamour at last overcomes this beast. The king takes Sir Eglamour back to his castle where his daughter (beautiful, of course) is being threatened by a giant. This giant is demanding her hand in marriage and when he appears, Sir Eglamour kills him singlehandedly. The King of Sidon at once offers to confer onto Sir Eglamour all his titles and lands, as well as the hand of his daughter in marriage.|$|E
25|$|Her major investigative works include La noche de Tlatelolco (Massacre in Mexico) (1971), Fuerte es el silencio (Strong is Silence) (1975) and Nada nadie. Las voces del temblor (Nothing No one: The Voices of the Earthquake) (1988). The {{best known}} of these is La noche de Tlatelolco about the 1968 {{repression}} of student protests in Mexico City. She {{found out about the}} massacre on the evening of October 2, 1968, when her son was only four months old. Afterwards, Poniatowska went out on the streets in the neighborhood and began interviewing people while there was still blood on the streets and shoes <b>strewn</b> <b>about</b> and women searching for the children who had not come home. The books contains interviews with informants, eyewitnesses, former prisoners which are interspersed with poems by Octavio Paz and Rosario Castellanos, excepts from pre Hispanic texts and newspaper as well as political slogans. Massacre in Mexico was the only book published on the subject for twenty years, contradicting the government's account of the events and the number dead. The government offered her the Xavier Villaurrutia Award in 1970 for the work but she refused it.|$|E

60|$|He {{was writing}} at a table, {{with a great}} {{confusion}} of clothes, tin cases, books, boots, brushes, and portmanteaus <b>strewn</b> all <b>about</b> the floor. He was only half dressed--in plain clothes, I observed, not in uniform--and his hair was unbrushed, and he looked as wild as his room. All this I saw after he had heartily welcomed me and I was seated near him, for he started upon hearing my voice and caught me in his arms in a moment. Dear Richard! He was ever the same to me. Down to--ah, poor poor fellow!--to the end, he never received me but with something of his old merry boyish manner.|$|R
60|$|Not {{only is the}} day waning, but the year. The low sun is fiery and yet cold {{behind the}} monastery ruin, and the Virginia creeper on the Cathedral wall has showered half its deep-red leaves down on the pavement. There has been rain this afternoon, and a wintry shudder goes among the little pools on the cracked, uneven flag-stones, and through the giant elm-trees as they shed a gust of tears. Their fallen leaves lie <b>strewn</b> thickly <b>about.</b> Some of these leaves, in a timid rush, seek {{sanctuary}} within the low arched Cathedral door; but two men coming out resist them, and cast them forth again with their feet; this done, {{one of the two}} locks the door with a goodly key, and the other flits away with a folio music-book.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed that}} Rachel herself had no {{suspicion}} {{that she was}} watched, or that there was anything in her manner likely {{to draw attention to}} her. What had happened to her she did not know. Her mind was very much in the condition of the racing water to which Helen compared it. She wanted to see Terence; she was perpetually wishing to see him when he was not there; it was an agony to miss seeing him; agonies were <b>strewn</b> all <b>about</b> her day on account of him, but she never asked herself what this force driving through her life arose from. She thought of no result any more than a tree perpetually pressed downwards by the wind considers the result of being pressed downwards by the wind.|$|R
500|$|Meanwhile, Deputy Hawk {{visits the}} {{residence}} of Harold Smith and finds him hanging dead amongst his orchids. Maddy announces to her Uncle Leland (Ray Wise) and Aunt Sarah (Grace Zabriskie) that she is leaving Twin Peaks {{to return to her}} home in Missoula, Montana. Cooper, Truman, and a police team arrive at Smith's residence. They discover the torn-up remains of Laura Palmer's secret diary <b>strewn</b> <b>about,</b> and a suicide note that reads, [...] "J'ai une âme solitaire." [...] Cooper translates, [...] "I am a lonely soul." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for Monster was widely controversial, being banned on MTV. Ta-Nehisi Coates of The Atlantic {{questioned}} [...] "what {{would have become}} of John Mayer, had he cut a video with dead black women <b>strewn</b> <b>about</b> and invoked black women throughout his lyrics in the manner Kanye does" [...] and labeled the video both racist and sexist in nature. However, Brandon Soderberg of Spin argues that the video was simply a [...] "surreal response to hip-hop misogyny" [...] and a [...] "knowing provocation", and commented that the video was in fact inspired by horror films.|$|E
500|$|At {{about the}} same time, the Prussian 5th, 14th, and 16th Brigades were {{starting}} to push through Plancenoit, in the third assault of the day. The church was by now on fire, while its graveyard—the French centre of resistance—had corpses <b>strewn</b> <b>about</b> [...] "as if by a whirlwind". Five Guard battalions were deployed {{in support of the}} Young Guard, virtually all of which was now committed to the defence, along with remnants of Lobau's corps. The key to the Plancenoit position proved to be the Chantelet woods to the south. Pirch's II Corps had arrived with two brigades and reinforced the attack of IV Corps, advancing through the woods.|$|E
5000|$|Kelly Grimes and Aaron Allston {{reviewed}} Beastmaker Mountain in The Space Gamer #58. They {{described it}} as [...] "a hero's adventure" [...] but noted {{that it was not}} [...] "a hack-'n-slash adventure of mismatches monsters, secret doors, and treasure <b>strewn</b> willy-nilly <b>about</b> a dungeon; Beastmaker Mountain was constructed with both sense and logic. An extensive amount of work has gone to detail. Monsters and treasures are placed logically and {{in the context of the}} area's rationale." [...] They added: [...] "The adventure has few flaws. There are occasional outbreaks of silliness ... but all these do is alter the tone of the adventure somewhat and can be worked around." [...] Grimes and Allston concluded the review by saying: [...] "All in all, the adventure is of good quality and excellent playability. It makes for a challenge and an enjoyable time".|$|R
2500|$|By [...] another rush on the {{south-eastern}} {{corner by}} IR 180 failed and more piecemeal attacks from all round the redoubt were driven off, with many casualties. Messages were {{sent back to}} the 26th Division headquarters for a bombardment and at [...] the divisional artillery began to fire on the redoubt, from the north-east to the south-east for one hour. The German infantry attacked again, supported by two battalions of IR 185, which had arrived from reserve at Beugny at about [...] and attacked from Stuff and Zollern (Goat) redoubts. In costly hand-to-hand fighting, the Germans recaptured the redoubt in about thirty minutes, finding it <b>strewn</b> with <b>about</b> [...] dead. By midnight the ridge had been re-occupied and two more battalions of IR 180 had arrived and moved to the Hansa Line and the redoubt, available to reinforce the front line from Thiepval to the Ancre.|$|R
6000|$|The room {{in which}} he sat was a fair {{specimen}} of the dwellings devoted to the employes of the Hudson's Bay Company throughout the country. It was large, and low in the roof, built entirely of wood, which was unpainted; a matter, however, of no consequence, as, from long exposure to dust and tobacco-smoke, the floor, walls, and ceiling had become one deep, uniform brown. The men's berths were constructed after the fashion of berths on board ship, being wooden boxes ranged in tiers round the room. Several tables and benches were <b>strewn</b> miscellaneously <b>about</b> the floor, in the centre of which stood a large double iron stove, with the word [...] "Carron" [...] stamped on it. This served at once for cooking, and warming the place. Numerous guns, axes, and canoe-paddles hung round the walls or were piled in corners, and the rafters sustained a miscellaneous mass of materials, the more conspicuous among which were snow-shoes, dog-sledges, axe handles, and nets.|$|R
500|$|A decade later, a New York Times {{reporter}} {{visiting the}} zoo noted that [...] "...an Asiatic Black Bear {{lay on a}} rock {{a short distance from}} a guard rail. A shattered wine bottle, a cracked stick, and a number of empty beer cans were <b>strewn</b> <b>about</b> the ground a few feet in front of him. 'How many times have I seen a bear lift his foot and leave a bloody foot print?' said John Kinzig, a park supervisor at the Prospect Park Zoo. 'Vandalism is a major problem, and deterioration is overtaking repairs.'" [...] Activists were pressing for major renovations of the zoo, which, in 1983, was rated by the Humane Society of the United States as one of the [...] "10 worst" [...] zoos in the country. Others felt that a zoo was not in keeping with the original design of Prospect Park and urged its complete removal from the grounds. A fatal accident of an 11-year-old boy scaling the fence to the polar bear pit only served to underscore difficulties with the fifty-year-old facility.|$|E
500|$|Harmonia {{begins when}} the protagonist [...] {{wakes up in}} a {{derelict}} facility without any memories of who or where he is. Rei notices that his right hand is mechanical, and when he sees various Phiroids <b>strewn</b> <b>about</b> the facility, he assumes he is a Phiroid whose production went unfinished, as he also realizes {{that he does not}} have any emotions. Rei leaves the facility and walks several days to the outskirts of a town, where he is found by a girl named [...] who takes him back to the church where she lives and names him Rei. To pay Shiona back for her kindness, Rei sets out to repair a broken music box containing a song her brother had composed. Rei goes to the library to find a book to help in the repairs and meets the librarian, a little girl named [...] who is constantly sad. Once the music box is repaired, Shiona is able to sing to the tune in the town plaza while Rei plays the music box. With the help of the townspeople, Rei also repairs a projector to play a film directed by the son of , the owner of the general store.|$|E
2500|$|Whether Nicola Pisano {{learned his}} {{appreciation}} of neo-classicism in Frederick II’s workshop {{or whether he}} picked up inspiration from the ruins of Roman sculpture that were <b>strewn</b> <b>about</b> Pisa during that time period one can only imagine, but what is known is that Nicola mastered the combination of Christian traditions such as the Narrative of Christ {{with the use of}} Roman and Late Antique style. With the similar pulpit in Pisa being finished in 1260 and this Siena pulpit being completed in 1268 {{it can be seen that}} Nicola embraced the Classic revival before any of those deemed “Renaissance Artists” ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{search for}} typical impact {{material}} (shatter cones, suevites, tektites), {{that could prove}} an impact event, has yet to take place. Based on available observations and data, this site is listed as improbable, or unlikely to be an impact site. But {{in spite of this}} an expedition by the Nicaraguan Scientific Association of Astronomers and Astrophysicists (Astronic) to the Pantasma Valley in July 2009 has provided some supoprt for the impact hypothesis. Note: The Pantasma valley can not be [...] "triassic" [...] (250 to 200 million years B.C.) because it lies on the caribbean platter, that was formed between 140 and 70 million years ago. The fresh look of the crater suggests an age of only up to 1 million years. In 2010, the Geologist Jean H. Cornec from Denver/Col. reportet the detection of a new tektite <b>strewn</b> field (<b>about</b> 800,000 years old!) in western Belize, 300 miles north-west, which could be strongly related to the Pantasma crater.|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{successes in}} {{exploration}} demonstrate that gas resources are undoubtedly widely {{available on the}} planet. Recent gas discoveries are <b>strewn</b> just <b>about</b> everywhere, affecting all the continents, and prospects for large undiscovered structures are promising. This abundance of gas reserves and resources, combined with the obvious need for cleaner fuels, fuel a "gas rush”. Indeed, benefiting in particular from its undeniable intrinsic properties, natural gas, which was never sure of a captive market, and which was actually restricted or banned in the power sector three decades ago, has proved very successful. Be it technological, economic or environmental, numerous factors have made it the fuel of choice in many key markets. Already accounting for about 24 % of primary energy requirements worldwide, gas enjoys the highest growth rate and the brightest prospects, readily grabbing additional shares of the energy mix. While on the whole gas availability does not raise any doubt in the medium-to-long term, major trends in discoveries and field characteristics are very likely to strongly impact the future of gas. The overall distribution of gas reserves on the earth in particular does no...|$|R
50|$|V. Guerin, {{who visited}} the site in 1875, {{provides}} a lengthy description of the ancient ruins in evidence throughout the area. He states his belief {{that this is the}} site of ancient Usha and speculates that the ruins of a finely built edifice in which there are the remnants of many columns was a synagogue. He then says a synagogue of Ousha should be constructed if there is not already such a place of worship in the vicinity. Also noting the presence of the domed wali of Neby Houchan consecrated to the prophet Hosea, he cites the Muslim tradition that this prophet is here interred. He describes the shrine as being constructed of what appear to ancient stones, with {{what seems to be a}} mihrab at its base, noting there are shreds of clothing <b>strewn</b> and floating <b>about</b> it.|$|R
