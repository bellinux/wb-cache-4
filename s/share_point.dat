50|$|As WBMG, channel 42's newscasts {{consistently}} languished at (an often distant) {{third place}} among the Birmingham market's television news operations. According to local legends, the station's newscasts often - inadvertently or not - became comedy shows. Examples of this include Tommy Charles (a local radio personality formerly with WSGN and WAQY, {{who served as a}} sports anchor for WBMG during the mid-1970s) wadding up scripts and tossing them over his shoulder during the sports segment after he read them, as well as even letting deflating balloons fly around the set for no apparent reason. Under Park Communications ownership, the station made concerted moves to professionalize its newscasts; under general manager Hugh Smith, it hired Thom Gossom as lead anchor, and acquired the first color remote vehicle in Birmingham (which incorporated equipment originally purchased in 1972 for its broadcasts of Dawson Memorial Baptist Church's weekly services); although these efforts led to little success in increasing its ratings. WBMG discontinued long-form local news programming in 1980, instead airing syndicated shows at both 5:00 and 10:00 p.m. The only news programming that aired on channel 42 for the next seven years consisted of hourly cut-ins during regular programming. WBMG re-established a full-fledged news department in 1987, but its newscasts barely registered much higher than hashmarks (less than one ratings <b>share</b> <b>point)</b> in the ratings.|$|E

[...] Andrew Billen wrote in The Times that Wallander and Ella's relationship not working out is conventional for a television detective drama, though liked how Wallander's depression [...] "has grown out of the failure of his marriage and the experiences of his career". On TV Scoop website, John Beresford wrote that the episode [...] "went quickly downhill" [...] from the murder of the taxi driver in the opening minutes; [...] "Pedestrian plots, characters that wander aimlessly about with next to nothing to do or say, and a format that seems better fitted for radio than it is for television. By that I mean the endless shots where there's a someone on the left of the screen, someone on the right, and they stand there for hours tal...king...verrrry...slow...ly to each other with absolutely nothing else happening." [...] One Step Behind received overnight ratings of 5.6 million (22.4%). Final ratings were recorded as 5.66 million, making it the week's twelfth-most-watched programme on BBC One. David Chater's Times preview called Branagh [...] "a masterpiece of vulnerability and despair". He wrote of the conclusion: [...] "a climactic scene that has been done dozens of times in thrillers, on this one occasion it felt entirely believable". The Daily Record named it [...] "Best of this week's TV" [...] though it was criticised in The Herald; David Belcher called it [...] "far worse than initially reckoned. Never has there been a less observant, more irritating fictional detective". Belcher hoped that no more adaptations would be made.|$|E
