5|$|The chassis of the C5 {{consists}} of two identical metal pressings which are joined at top and bottom with a closing plate at the rear. It lacks a separate suspension system, instead relying on the chassis structure having enough torsional flex. Its motor was produced in Italy by Polymotor, {{a subsidiary of the}} Dutch company Philips. Although it was later famously said that the C5 was powered by a washing machine motor, the motor was in fact developed from a design produced to drive a truck cooling fan. Lotus provided the gearbox and a rear axle based on a design for car <b>steering</b> <b>columns.</b> The C5's electronics were produced by MetaLab, a Sinclair spin-off. The wheels were assembled from tyres made in Taiwan and wheels from Italy. Oldham Batteries provided a lead-acid battery developed for Sinclair that could manage more than the 300 charge-discharge cycles that had originally been specified.|$|E
25|$|Pontiacs {{built in}} the late 1960s {{conformed}} to new U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. These included energy-absorbing interior parts such as <b>steering</b> <b>columns,</b> steering wheels, knobs and handles, dual-circuit hydraulic brake systems, shoulder belts, side marker lights, and headrests.|$|E
25|$|Drive train, {{front and}} rear suspension, brakes, radiators, master cylinders, trunnions, <b>{{steering}}</b> <b>columns,</b> power steering pumps, engines, transmissions, brake drums and rotors are interchangeable with 1965 and 1966 Ambassadors and Classics. Some parts are even interchangeable back to 1958 and earlier, while other components were used by AMC into the 1970s.|$|E

50|$|A {{combination}} {{steering lock}} and ignition key was fitted to the <b>steering</b> <b>column,</b> which replaced the dashboard mounted ignition switch and charismatic push button starter. A new <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> was {{fitted with a}} collapsible section {{in the event of}} an accident.|$|R
50|$|The {{collapsible}} <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> {{has been}} designed to protect the driver from injuries caused by striking the steering system in a crash. Consisting of two interlocking shafts, the collapsible <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> absorbs energy by collapsing inwards or breaking upon impact.|$|R
25|$|In 1966, Cadillac had {{its best}} annual sales yet, over 192,000 units (142,190 of them de Villes), an {{increase}} of more than 60%. This was exceeded in 1968, when Cadillac topped 200,000 units for the first time. 1967 and 1968 saw {{the introduction of a}} host of federally mandated safety features, including energy-absorbing <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> and wheels, soft interior and instrument panel knobs and surfaces, front shoulder belts, and side marker lights.|$|E
25|$|The city of Lackawanna redeveloped some of {{the former}} Lackawanna Steel plant land into small {{business}} zones, bringing about 700 jobs back to the town in the late 1980s. In 1993, Veritas Capital, Inc., purchased one of the bar, rod and wire plants on the old Lackawanna site and added another 250 jobs (the workers made automobile <b>steering</b> <b>columns).</b> Bethlehem Steel ended coke production at the Lackawanna site in 2001, and as of 2008 only a galvanized steel finishing plant employing about 250 people remained.|$|E
25|$|In 1930 {{cars had}} {{dashboards}} of rigid metal, non-collapsible <b>steering</b> <b>columns,</b> and protruding knobs, buttons, and levers. Without seat belts, passengers in a frontal collision could be hurled against {{the interior of}} the automobile or through the windshield. The vehicle body itself was rigid, and impact forces were transmitted directly to the vehicle occupants. As late as the 1950s, car manufacturers were on public record as saying that vehicle accidents simply could not be made survivable because the forces in a crash were too great.|$|E

50|$|For 1982, the locking <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> was introduced; the {{ignition}} switch, dimmer switch and wiper switch were relocated to the <b>steering</b> <b>column.</b> After 1982, 3-speed manuals would be relocated {{to the floor}} and base models will no longer have round headlamps, which would make Manual Transmission 1982 G vans rare and collectable as 1982 was the only model year with column shift manual transmission and ignition switch on the <b>steering</b> <b>column.</b> Also, 1982 was the only year with the left rear glass as an option on one side only.|$|R
25|$|Options {{included}} headrests ($52) and a tilt-telescopic <b>steering</b> <b>column.</b>|$|R
25|$|Inside, {{headrests}} {{were now}} standard equipment {{and a new}} instrument panel included square instruments replacing the round instruments of previous years along with a push-button operated ashtray and rotary glove compartment knob, as well as heating/air conditioning controls relocated {{from the center of}} the dash to the left of the steering wheel near the lights and wiper switches. The high-beam lights indicator was a red rocket located on the dash. Also new was a steering column-mounted ignition switch that also locked the steering wheel when not in use â€“ a feature found on all 1969-model General Motors passenger cars, a year before locking <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> were required by federal mandate starting in 1970.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with other}} 1969 GM vehicles, locking <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> were {{incorporated}} into the Nova. Simulated air extractor/vents were added below the Nova script, which was relocated to the front fender behind the wheelwell instead of the rear quarter panel. The [...] V8 with four-barrel carburetor that came standard with the SS option was revised with a [...] increase to , while a two-barrel carbureted version of the [...] V8 rated at [...] was a new option on non-SS models. The SS option price remained US$312 A new Turbo-Hydramatic 350 three-speed automatic was made available for non-SS Novas with six-cylinder and V8 engines, although the older two-speed Powerglide continued to be available on the smaller-engined Novas. 1969 SS models were the first Nova SS models to have standard front disc brakes.|$|E

50|$|The {{steering}} wheels were rigid and mounted on non-collapsible <b>steering</b> <b>columns.</b> This arrangement increased {{the risk of}} impaling the driver {{in case of a}} severe crash. The first collapsible steering column was invented in 1934 but was never successfully marketed. By 1956, Ford came out with a safety steering wheel that was set high above the post with spokes that would flex, but the column was still rigid. In 1968, United States regulations (FMVSS Standard No. 204) were implemented concerning the acceptable rearward movement of the steering wheel in case of crash. Collapsible <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> were required to meet that standard.|$|E
