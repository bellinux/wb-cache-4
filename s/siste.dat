50|$|Cusack {{was raised}} in the Anglican church, but {{converted}} to Catholicism in 1858. She entered the Poor Clare Sisters, and was then known as Sister Francis Clare. She worked in many forms of ministry in Ireland over the years, and was known for her writing. In 1881, she went to Knock, in County Mayo, to open a school for young woman during the day, which held evening classes for daytime land workers. Other women were inspired by this work, and this led her to decision to form her own community, the <b>Sistes</b> of Saint Joseph of Peace. Conflict with Church leaders in Knock caused her to seek support in England, and in 1884, with the support of Cardinal Manning and Bishop Bagshawe, she received approval for her new order from Pope Leo XIII, and the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace was founded.|$|R

40|$|To orchestrate the genomic {{response}} to cellular stress signals, p 53 recognizes and binds to DNA containing specific and well-characterized p 53 -responsive elements (REs). Differences in RE sequences can strongly affect the p 53 transactivation capacity and occur even between closely related species. Therefore, {{the identification and}} characterization of a species-specific p 53 Binding <b>sistes</b> (BS) consensus sequence and of the associated target genes may help to provide {{new insights into the}} evolution of the p 53 regulatory networks across different species. Although p 53 functions were studied {{in a wide range of}} species, little is known about the p 53 -mediated transcriptional signature in Danio rerio. Here, we designed and biochemically validated a computational approach to identify novel p 53 target genes in Danio rerio genome. Screening all the Danio rerio genome by pattern-matching-based analysis, we found p 53 RE-like patterns proximal to 979 annotated Danio rerio genes. Prioritization analysis identified a subset of 134 candidate pattern-related genes, 31 of which have been investigated in further biochemical assays. Our study identified runx 1, axin 1, traf 4 a, hspa 8, col 4 a 5, necab 2, and dnajc 9 genes as novel direct p 53 targets and 12 additional p 53 -controlled genes in Danio rerio genome.

40|$|Evidence for the monophyly of Loricariinae is {{presented}} using phylogenetic analysis (maximum parsimony in PAUP*) of osteological and external morghological characters. The two different analyses used, with the characters unordered {{and the characters}} partly ordered, produced the same levels of relationship among the ingroup taxa, displaying similar support (similar values of decay index and bootstrap). The analyses showed differences in the Loricariinae sister group. In the unordered analysis, the <b>sistes</b> group of the Loricariinae is a clade formed by representatives of Hypostominae, Ancistrinae and Hypoptopomatinae. In the ordered analysis, Neoplecostomus came out as the sister group of Loricariinae. Loricariinae is diagnosed by a large set of synapomorphies under both data sets. Loricariinae is subdivided in two large clades, Loricariini Bonaparte, 1831 and Harttiini Boeseman, 1971, which basically comprise the genera originally assigned. Loricariini comprises two subclades here named after already available taxa, Hemiodontichthyina (Isbrucker, 1979) and Planiloricariina (Isbrucker, 1979, 1980), plus the genera Loricaria, Spatuloricaria and the non-monophyletic Rineloricaria. Harttiini comprises two subclades, Farlowellina (Fowler, 1958) and Harttiina (Boeseman, 1971), plus the genus Sturisomatichthys. In Planiloricariina, Crossoloricaria came out non-monophyletic, and Crossoloricaria and Apistoloricaria are synonymized to Rhadinoloricaria, since these taxa are not supported separately, but as a clade. All taxa inside Loricariinae are diagnosed phylogenetically. The phylogenetic results are discussed under the current systematics for the group. Taxa not available for the analyses were tentatively placed within the phylogenetic hypothesis proposed. New systematic accounts are provided. The co-occurrence of extreme sets of apomorphies is discussed. Due to the positive correlation between sex dimorphic traits and monophyletic groups, a hypothesis on origin of dimorphic traits in Loricariinae is inferred...|$|R
40|$|Two plasmid {{systems were}} used {{successfully}} for entrapping and analyzing IS 1 plasmid insertion mutants in E. coli. Plasmid pS 177 carries the sucrose-sensitive sacR/B genes and cells harboring the plasmid are lethal on 5 % sucrose plates. Plasmid DNAs of the survivor colonies were extracted and screend for insertions of IS 1 by restriction mapping and Southern hybridization. Ninety-one IS 1 plasmid insertion mutants were collected and their insertion junction sequences determined. The {{results indicated that}} there were total of 24 insertions <b>sistes</b> for the 91 plasmid IS 1 insertion mutants. The insertions were distributed fairly random in the target sacR/B genes. Plasmids pBLT and pBLA were originally constructed by cloning the immunity region of bacteriophage lambda into the EcoRI site of pBR 322 in both orientations. They carry the temperature-sensitive cI 857 gene {{and part of the}} lambda left operon containing the left promoter/operator, N gene, tL 1, and ral, cIII, ssb and kil genes. Cells harboring the plasmid are lethal at 40 ℃ because that the temperature-sensitive cI 857 repressor is non-functional at 40 ℃ and the Kil protein is expressed. Plasmid DNAs of the six-hundred-and-ninety 40 ℃ survivor colonies were extracted and again screened for insertions of IS 1 by restriction mapping and Southern hybridization. The restriction mapping results indicated that of the 323 IS 1 insertions isolated, 226 had insertions in the N gene, 6 in the ssb gene and 91 in the kil gene. Nineteen IS 1 insertion mutant plasmids, of which 5 had insertions in the N gene, 6 had insertions in the ssb gene and 8 had insertions in the kil gene, were randomly picked for insertion junction sequence determination. and the results confirmed the mapping results. Insertions in the N or kil gene were detected in both orientations at about equal frequency; but insertions in the ssb gene were detected only in one orientation in which transcription of the IS 1 transposase is {{in the same direction as}} the oL/pL transcription. Several pBLT derivatives were constructed in which a copy of IS 1 was cloned either in the ssb gene but in the reverse orientation, or in the region between the kil and the ssb genes in both orientations. Cells harboring these pBLT derivatives were plated out at both 40 ℃ and 30 ℃ and their ratios of cfu at 30 ℃were measured. The results showed that those cells were unable to grow at 40 ℃unless deletions had occurred in the containing plasmids so that the left promoters were deleted. This implied that the insertion of IS 1 in one orientation, but not in the other orientation, generated a transcriptional terminator to block expression of the downstream kil gene, and that SSB and possibly N proteins were capable of antiterminating the termination. There were many IS 1 -mediated pBLT deletion mutants generated during the course of the study. Twenty such mutants were randomly chosen for restriction mapping of the deletion endpoints. While their one endpoints were located in the region between oL/pL and kil in several positions, their other endpoints, with one exception, were all located in the vicinity of the reported pBR 332 IS 1 insertion hotspot. 本研究使用兩種質體系統篩選並分析大腸桿菌的IS 1 轉位變異株。質體pS 177 帶有對 5 %蔗糖敏感的sacR/B基因，使帶有此質體的菌在含有 5 %的蔗糖的培養皿上死亡，但是菌若在sacR/B處發生變異，則可存活下來。本研究首先收集 5 %蔗糖培養皿上的存活變異株，再自其中以內限制及南方雜配法篩選有染色體IS 1 插入的質體變異株。總共分離到 91 個IS 1 質體插入變異株。將此 91 株的IS 1 插入點以DNA定序方法定出。結果共得到 24 個插入點，這些插入點均勻地分佈於sacR/B基因的DNA片段上。 質體pBLT及pBLA是將噬菌體λ的免疫區的DNA片段選殖到質體pBR 322 上的EcoRI切位上所得到的兩個方向反的質體。此二質體皆帶有對溫度敏感的cI 857 基因及部分λ的left operon，其中包括oL/pL啟動子、N基因、tL 1 及ral、cIII、ssb、kil等基因。由於cI 857 基因所做出的抑制子在 40 ℃時會喪失其對oL/pL啟動子抑制的功能，導致Kil蛋白質表現，使帶有pBLT或pBLA的菌死亡。以限制及南方雜配法自 690 株 40 ℃存活株中篩選IS 1 插入株，得到 323 株IS 1 質體插入株。根據限制切割的結果，推測其中有 226 株IS 1 插在N基因上， 56 株IS 1 插在ssb上， 91 株IS 1 插在kil上。隨機選取 5 株插在N基因、 8 株插在kil基因、及 6 株插在ssb基因上的變異株做IS 1 插入點定序。此 19 株變異株之定序結果，與以內限制異株中，均可得到IS 1 插入位置的結果吻合。定序結果同時顯示插在N及kil上的變 異株中,均可得到IS 1 以正或反方向的變異株。而插在ssb上的變異株中，人武部都是IS 1 以正向（IS 1 轉位轉錄方向與oL/pL轉錄方向一致的方向）插入的變異株。 本研究進一步構築將IS 1 以反方向選殖到ssb基因上，以及將IS 1 以正反兩種方向選殖到介於ssb及kil基因之間的pBLT衍生質體，並且計算這些衍生質體轉型株菌液在 40 ℃的cfu/ml與 30 ℃的cfu/ml的比值。結果顯示除非質體上之oL/pL因IS 1 -mediated deletion事件被刪除、這些轉型株都不能在 40 ℃中生長。這結果也顯示IS 1 正向插入時，會產生transcriptional terminator，可中斷其下游的kil基因表現；並且SSB及N蛋白質可能對此terminator行antitermination作用，面反向插入的LS 1 上就不會產生terminator。因此，以內限制酉每將 20 株有IS 1 -mediated deletion的刪除株檢查刪除的區域，發現有 15 株其刪除的區域一端的端點，位於pBLT上的一個Zerbib等人(1985) 報導過的pBR 322 IS / insertion hostpot的附近...|$|R
