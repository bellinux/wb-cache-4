The possibility of printing postage stamps and other <b>security</b> <b>items</b> in India had been enquired into before the First World War but could not be pursued at that time.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{tested the}} {{properties}} of the 18 Household Food <b>Security</b> Survey (HFSS) <b>items,</b> and the validity of the resulting food security classifications, in an English-speaking middle-income country. Methods Survey of primary school children in Trinidad and Tobago. Parents completed the HFSS. Responses were analysed for the 10 adult-referenced items and the eight child-referenced items. Item response theory models were fitted. Item calibrations and subject scores from a one-parameter logistic (1 PL) model were compared with those from either two-parameter logistic model (2 PL) or a model for differential item functioning (DIF) by ethnicity. Results There were 5219 eligible with 3858 (74 %) completing at least one food <b>security</b> <b>item.</b> Adult item calibrations (standard error) in the 1 PL model ranged from - 4. 082 (0. 019) for the 'worried food would run out' item to 3. 023 (0. 042) for 'adults often do not eat for a whole day'. Child item calibrations ranged from - 3. 715 (0. 025) for 'relied on a few kinds of low cost food' to 3. 088 (0. 039) for 'child didn't eat for a whole day'. Fitting either a 2 PL model, which allowed discrimination parameters to vary between items, or a differential item functioning model, which allowed item calibrations to vary between ethnic groups, had little influence on interpretation. The classification based on the adult-referenced items showed that there were 19 % of respondents who were food insecure without hunger, 10 % food insecure with moderate hunger and 6 % food insecure with severe hunger. The classification based on the child-referenced items showed that there were 23 % of children who were food insecure without hunger and 9 % food insecure with hunger. In both children and adults food insecurity showed a strong, graded association with lower monthly household income (P Conclusion These results support the use of 18 HFSS items to classify food security status of adults or children in an English-speaking country where food insecurity and hunger are more frequent overall than in the US. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The 2004 National Household Survey Data was {{analyzed}} {{to test the}} hypothesis that cash transference from government social programs is associated with household food security. Methods: Secondary data were used from the National Household Sample Survey which interviewed residents of 112, 716 households. The present analysis included permanent and temporary private households, where food <b>security</b> <b>items</b> were informed by a resident of the household, restricting the collection of data to households with per capita monthly income of up to 1 minimum wage, representing 51. 2 % of the sample. Three models for estimating the amount of cash transference were developed; model 3 was chosen because it was less likely to overestimate effects. To analyze how cash transference affected the prevalence of food security, only households that received cash transference were included in the analysis, representing 14. 2 % of the interviewed households. The association between food security and cash transference, controlled for other independent variables, was estimated using a logistic regression model with stepwise method {{for each of the three}} income strata. Results: The mean per capita cash transference was of R$ 81. 68 per family. Multiple logistic regression showed an increased chance of food security of 8 % per each R$ 10. 00 contributed by social programs. Rural residence, male head of household, and Caucasian head of household were factors that also presented a higher chance of food security.

40|$|ObjectiveâTo assess {{convergent}} validity, factorial validity, testâretest {{reliability and}} {{internal consistency of}} a diet quality food behaviour checklist (FBC) for low-literate, low-income Spanish speakers. DesignâParticipants (n 90) completed three dietary recalls, the Spanish-language version of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM) and the Spanish-language FBC. Factor structure was examined using principal component analysis. Spearman correlation coefficients between FBC item responses and nutrient intakes from 24 h recalls were used to estimate convergent validity. Correlation coefficients were also calculated between FBC item responses at two time points in another group of participants (n 71) to examine testâretest reliability. Cronbach's Î± coefficient was determined for items within each sub-scale. SettingâNon-profit community agencies serving low-income clients, migrant farm worker camps and low-income housing sites in four California counties. SubjectsâSpanish-speaking women (n 161) who met income eligibility for the SNAP-Ed (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance ProgramâEducation). ResultsâFactor analysis resulted in six sub-scales. Responses to nineteen food behaviour items were significantly correlated with hypothesized 24 h recall data (with a maximum correlation of 0 Â· 44 for drinking milk and calcium) or the USDA HFSSM (0 Â· 42 with the food <b>security</b> <b>item).</b> Coefficients for testâretest reliability ranged from 0 Â· 35 to 0 Â· 79.

Even if the rail safety landscape in urban guided transport is highly diversified, the sector will benefit from some kind of harmonization. Furthermore, <b>security</b> <b>items</b> are considered more and more as vital for the urban transport sector. The 22 partners are from industry, associations, R&D organisations, consultants and operators. VThe MODSafe project successfully started in 2008 with state of the art evaluations and initial models. Hazard analyses, safety requirements as well as functional and object models have been developed in the safety sector, while a life cycle approach proposal and an approval approach were established in the process sector. For the security sector, the existing means and technologies for security systems have been analysed, forming the base for a model reference under development. As an outlook to the project closure in August 2012, one can expect reasonable suggestions for the future, aiming to contribute to the European drive for harmonize and to simplify the upgrade/modernization or new construction of urban guided transport systems.
