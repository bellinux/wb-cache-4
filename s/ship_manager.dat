The empirical analysis of the cognition maps reveals that there are big {{differences between the two}} countries and among the four respondent groups and that the <b>shipping</b> <b>managers</b> are more concerned with a wider range of financial ratios when dealing with the financial problems; in contrast, the financial ratios focused by certificated public accounts (CPAs) are in relatively narrower range than the <b>shipping</b> <b>managers.</b> Both the <b>shipping</b> <b>managers</b> and the CPAs are little concerned with the groups of activity efficiency and cash flow out of the total six groups. The contribution of cognition map in this study enables stakeholders of the shipping companies to predict management behaviour of <b>shipping</b> <b>managers.</b> The cognition map also contributes to predicting business and financial strategies of the shipping companies, based on the cognition of financial ratios of their <b>shipping</b> <b>managers,</b> subject to global economic booming or slowdown conditions...|$|R

In 1730 the pair secured a government licence to moor a ship [...] with a prominent light affixed to it to serve as a navigation aid [...] at the Nore in the Thames mouth. Hamblin and Avery intended to profit from the vessel by collecting a fee from passing merchant vessels. The licence was opposed by Trinity House which considered that it possessed a monopoly on construction and maintenance of navigation aids in British waters. After extensive legal dispute the licence was revoked in 1732 and Trinity House assumed direct responsibility for the proposed lightship; Hamblin and Avery were granted nominal lease revenues in exchange. The Nore lightship commenced operations in 1734.|$|E

Exmar NV is supervising an LPG carrier new building programme and a refit of its LNG fleet to accommodate Regas operations on a number of its LNG Gas Carriers. EXMAR Ship Management Superintendents are typically former serving Officers who manage vessels from NB spec review to full operations. Similarly, the experience gained in assisting the owner during pre-delivery and the first months of operation (first outfit, guarantee items, etc.) are utilised for the subsequent technical superintendence of the vessel. The company's Marine Department manages all aspects of vessel conformance with the relevant ISO, OHSAS and TMSA standards.Training programs have been set up with the Antwerp Maritime Academy and other Institutes for in-depth training with the STCW and ARPA, BRM, GMDSS and full mission Bridge simulators.|$|E
40|$|An {{assessment}} of {{the rationale for the}} vertical disintegration of ship management suggests that there might be compelling economic benefits for the separation of ownership from management. In this context, as a means for developing effective marketing strategies, it is important for ship managers to know the criteria used by current and prospective clients for <b>ship</b> <b>manager</b> selection and evaluation. The aim {{of this paper is to}} empirically identify the dimensions for <b>ship</b> <b>manager</b> selection and performance evaluation and their relative importance and to discuss the implications for marketing emanating from such an assessment. The methodology adopted includes the collection of secondary and primary data, both from ship managers and their clients, using interviews and a mail survey. The results indicate the prevailing importance of certain dimensions in selection (e. g. technical ability, reputation, competency) and evaluation (responsiveness, trustworthiness, technical ability), whereas it also found that price alone is not perceived to be as important in <b>ship</b> <b>manager</b> selection. It is concluded that placing emphasis on such dimensions in the formulation of a marketing strategy will contribute towards the attraction and retention of clients, whereas cost-cutting measures to allow price reduction, as well as advertising, will be ineffective over the long term.

40|$|The {{last four}} decades {{have seen the}} rise of third party ship {{management}} and its evolution into an industry in its own right. This signified a new reality in ship management practice, whereby the traditional custom of {{doing business with the}} ship owner being also the <b>ship</b> <b>manager</b> was abandoned and a revolutionary model that assigned the role of the owner {{and the role of the}} manager to two different entities was proposed. In essence, then, third party ship management comes very close, in principle and in practice, to the separation of ownership and management as experienced in many industrial fields, after the emergence, in the last half of the 19 th century, of the salaried manager. The purpose of this paper is to examine the forces at work in the process of such separation with a view to provide an insight into the relevant, contemporary parameters that can be considered instrumental in the strategic decision to employ third party ship management...|$|E
40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 449 on 01. 02. 2017 by CS (TIS) Professional ship management, i. e. {{the management of}} ships by third parties {{on behalf of their}} owners, has grown in importance in international shipping. This research investigates the relationship between professional ship managers and their clients in order to lay down the foundations for optimal marketing strategies directed towards retention of current clients and prospects over the long-term. Professional ship management has been described as an efficient organisational. adjustment {{to the needs of the}} global shipping market and a way by which western countries have been trying to sustain their global maritime dominance (Sletmo 1989). Despite this, ship management has received little attention from academia. The importance of the subject area and the limited scientific attention it has received, make professional ship management worthy of scholarly consideration. A review of ship management was undertaken in order to ascertain current marketing policies and problems faced by the industry. Frequent client defections and client uncertainty and dissatisfaction coupled with marketing directed towards client attraction (mainly promotion) resulted in identifying that application of relationship marketing may be beneficial for professional ship management. A review of the relationship marketing literature supported the application of the concept in a ship management context and assisted in developing a conceptual model. The conceptual model aimed towards identifying the dimensionality of ship manager-client relationships and their classification. Classification involved carrying out tests to identify whether ship management companies may be assembled into segments on the basis of their client relationships, and if so, whether particular characteristics of the interacting organisations may be found in particular relationship segments. Analysis of the data obtained from telephone interviews with a sample of ship managers in the United Kingdom and Cyprus resulted in the identification of the dimensions in ship manager-client relationships. A subsequent questionnaire to the respondents aimed at identifying the organisational characteristics of the companies and obtained structured responses to the relationship dimensions. Application of cluster analysis indicated the existence of four segments of ship management companies on the basis of their client relationships. The clusters obtained were validated and also supported on a theoretical basis from the relationship marketing literature. Preliminary investigation between organisational, characteristics and cluster membership indicated that companies in particular relationship segments share certain similar organisational characteristics. Multiple discriminant analysis assisted in identifying those organisational characteristics that are more strongly associated with cluster membership. A discussion of the results provides serious implications for practitioners, be it professional ship management companies or their clients. The research shows that ship management companies may be facing problems due to their client relationship attitudes, that the ship management industry is segmented in terms of service providers and that clients can have a choice of <b>ship</b> <b>manager</b> based on their individual needs. Companies with particular client relationships may face problems like short-term contracts and client defections. Based on the study, ship management companies will be able to address and combat such problems. Furthermore, implications for theory development, research methodology in a maritime context and scope for further research in professional ship management are discussed...|$|E
