40|$|Considering {{the data}} from the Ministry of Agriculture, in 2014 the Gross Domestic Product - Brazilian {{agricultural}} GDP accounted for about 23 % of the total GDP of the Brazilian economy, in reais equivalent to R $ 1. 1 trillion. And within it agriculture is represented in 70 % of the production of agribusiness. Seen it, one sees Brazil's potential in this activity. Therefore, it is evident that this Montate production needs to be managed throughout the production cycle. This includes as a first <b>step</b> <b>planting,</b> a fact that needs initial investment to allow the harvest {{to the end of the}} process. Because of this it was thought what are the ways to start agricultural production. This work specifically measured the transgenic soybean crop in the state of Goiás. The source of the resource that defrayed the cost of production was studied. It found that can be made via bank through a rural financing or financing with own resources, considering that the farmer has this option when you start your planting. If the producer utilizasse own resources he would not receive the full amount calculated the profitability of Agribusiness Credit Bills - LCA. By financing the farmer will pay only the interest calculated if using all capital financed the formalization of the contract. And taking into account that the cost of financing ranges from planting to harvest, if the releases are gradually made the producer may also reduce the interest to be paid. </p...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of three cycles of mass selection to improve simultaneously yield and grain protein in the maize population GR-OP- 319, derived from the F- 2 generation of the single-cross hybrid PX- 95. The two step selection procedure involved a stratified mass selection system that included check plants for environmental control. In the first <b>step,</b> <b>plants</b> having grain yield higher than 80 % of the check-plant mean and protein concentration greater than the check-plant mean were selected. In the second <b>step,</b> the four <b>plants</b> within each selection grid having the highest protein concentration were selected, which resulted in a final selection intensity of 5 %, Three cycles of selection were completed during 1991 to 1995. Response to selection was evaluated during the selection process and by direct field evaluation of the C- 0, C- 1, C- 2, and C- 3 populations in 1995 and 1996. The average response during the selection was 5. 1 % cycle(- 1) for yield, 0. 8 g kg(- 1) cycle(- 1) for protein concentration, and 7. 0 % cycle(- 1) for protein yield. No measurable differences among cycles were observed in the direct field evaluation even though the trends in the means of the cycles followed the trends shown during selection.

The first section provides an overview of the classification of membranes for hydrogen separation, while the second section describes their preparation technology in detail.

The last section deals with the analysis of the water gas shift (WGS) reaction as a case study, and in particular its application downstream to a reforming <b>step</b> <b>plant</b> {{in order to reduce the}} CO content in the exhaust stream. Two possibilities of coupling a membrane with a water gas shift reactor (WGSR) are investigated: either as an open architecture, where hydrogen separation modules are located before and/or after the WGSR, or as an integral WGSR membrane reactor (closed architecture), where reaction and separation occur in a single step. After a literature review focusing on the use of membranes for hydrogen separation in the WGS reaction, the next section discusses the mathematical modeling of a WGS membrane reactor, comparing the performances of the two proposed configurations. The last part of the chapter focuses on a preliminary techno-economic analysis, comparing conventional technology with membrane assisted WGSR developed around open architecture...|$|R

Besides, succulent plants freezed under liquid nitrogen turn to stonelike tissues {{that are difficult to}} grind. Flowers were not considered as a source of genomic DNA as the case of young leaves, this might be due to the seasonal nature and short half-life feature. Several protocols described for plant DNA isolation from Aloe barbadensis Miller using leaf, found difficult and tedious. This plant contains exceptionally high amount of secondary metabolites that interfere with DNA isolation. To address this problem, young leaf gel was used for DNA isolation that gave good quality DNA suitable for molecular biological applications. Cell lyses was carried out in extraction buffer supplemented with cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide and sodium chloride. Inclusion of high concentration of CTAB and PVP removed polyphenols. Chloroform Isoamyl washes followed by precipitation with NaCl efficiently removed high protein and polysaccharide contamination. The yield of pure DNA ranges from 25 - 50 μg per gram of leaf tissues. The RAPD analysis from the isolated DNA was optimized to produce clear amplification in all the germplasm tested. Index Terms- Aloe barabdensis, DNA isolation, medicinal plant, leaf gel A I...|$|R

They efficiency depends on used technological process conditions as well as plant species. One {{of the most dangerous}} metallic elements mercury plays a particular role, which is a trace element and a physiologically foreign in living organisms. Mercury has a high degree of toxicity with strong affinity to thiol groups. This may cause an adverse effect on the enzymatic processes and consequently inhibiting the physiological functions. Because of high risk for human health, water environment treatment from mercury is essential proecological action. Mercury removal studies were conducted using Salvinia natans pleustofit, sampled from its natural water environment. In the first step, epiphytic bacteria, which was resistant to high concentrations of mercury (0, 6 mgHg/l), was isolated from the plant and than selected by the tiles gradient mthod.

In the following <b>step</b> <b>plant</b> Salvinia natans was exposure to high levels of mercury {{in the presence of the}} three isolated Pseudomonas strains with exceptional resistance characteristics to environmental factors.
