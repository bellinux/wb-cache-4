Twenty-five percent of the light from the lens' central image was siphoned through a semi-transparent reflex mirror and reflected off a piggy-backed secondary mirror to the AF module.

40|$|Introduction Quality in {{radiology}} {{images can}} be assessed by determining the levels of information retained or lost in an image. Information loss in images has been recently assessed via a method based on information theory and the employment of a contrast-detail (CD) phantom. In this study, the traditional CD phantom (air-Perspex) and a modified CD phantom were used. Methods Using the Agfa DX-D 600 digital flat panel system, six phantom radiographs were acquired at 70 kVp and 20 mAs. Three x-ray images were acquired for each phantom. Results Our results demonstrate that the material within the CD phantom influences total information loss (TIL) and image quality figure (IQF) measurements. The modified CD phantom provides a more realistic account of TIL and IQF for soft tissue radiology imaging. Conclusion It is recommended that a low inherent <b>subject</b> <b>contrast</b> phantom, such as this modified CD phantom, {{be added to the}} image quality assessment processes of radiology departments.

40|$|Relating to the {{adoption}} of the Law No. 18 / 1997 of the Legal Code, the so called ?Atom Law? amended with the Law No. 13 / 2002 of the Legal Code, the radiation protection regulations were considerably toughen. According to the Paragraph 4 of the Law each subject executing operations resulting in radiation is obliged to ensure priority radiation protection. In addition, each subject is obliged to implement quality assurance system according to the Regulation No. 214 / 1997 of the Legal Code and each subject authorized to handling sources of ionizing radiation is according to the Paragraph 18, Article I, Letter a) of the Atom Law also obliged to monitor the source of ionizing radiation by monitoring, measuring, evaluating and recording relevant figures. The Law No. 18 / 97 of the Legal Code also imposes the obligation to maintain such level of radiation protection that the life and health hazard and the environmental threats are as low as it is reasonably possible when economic and social views are taken into account. This optimization is attained with the implementation of the quality assurance program, which contains the long-term stability test. One of the steps leading to optimization and reduction of the ionizing radiation dose is correct selection of the load parameters of the X-ray machine. An important factor is the used voltage of the x-ray tube; it affects the input surface kerma, which is the fundamental information for the subsequent estimation of the effective dose. Changing this parameter can considerably effect, or decrease, the absorbed dose for the patients and the staff. Often such conditions arise which necessitate a voltage change, which on the other hand require a change in exposition (mAs or distance). However, we {{have to keep in mind}} that increased voltage together with adjusted exposition with the average density maintained the same; will result in lower image contrast, because the x-ray radiation produced with higher voltage reduces the <b>subject</b> <b>contrast.</b> The same applies vice versa, i. e. when voltage is decreased, <b>subject</b> <b>contrast</b> is increased. The objectives of the practical part of the thesis is to find out based on dosimetry measurement using a phantom, what is the effect of the voltage change on the x-ray tube on the increase or decrease of the radiation load on patients during skiagraphic procedures...|$|E
40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown that caries diagnostics is improved when performed on radiographs exposed with a voltage of 60 kV compared to 70 kV. This is because low voltage provides higher <b>subject</b> <b>contrast.</b> The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether the tube voltage used when exposing bitewings, influence the possibility to diagnose caries when using a new digital system with CMOS-sensors. Extracted teeth were mounted and bitewings exposed with both 60 and 70 kV and varying exposure times, using a digital system with CMOS-sensors. Observers with different experience in dentistry evaluated the radiographs for caries. CBCT of each single tooth was used as golden standard. There was no significant difference between the results of diagnosing caries between radiographs exposed with 60 kV compared to 70 kV. All radiographs that were exposed to an acceptable level of brightness gave similar result, independent on voltage. In conclusion; there was no significant difference between radiographic caries diagnosis performed with radiographs exposed with 60 compared to 70 kV, given that the exposure time was optimized. This indicates that 70 kV can be used for all intraoral examination if a correct decreased exposure time is used and that lowering to 60 kV is not necessary when intraoral examinations for caries evaluation are performed...|$|E
40|$|Finding {{appropriate}} measures to trigger machine changes in an adaptive system remains a huge {{challenge in the}} field of adaptive automation. Trigger candidates include the alpha, beta, and theta frequency bands of the EEG. These measures have been linked to mental effort and could therefore potentially be used in an adaptive control loop aimed at keeping mental effort investment high enough to prevent boredom related problems yet low enough to prevent overload related problems. Both of these unwanted states of mental effort are relevant for the driving task and may be viewed as a predictor for unsafe driving. When driving, task demands and mental effort investment may be regulated by changing driving speed. This could be handled by a biocybernetic system monitoring mental effort investments. To explore which EEG locations (8) and frequency bands (5) are most informative for such a system, drivers were exposed to a range of driving speeds, relative to the driver’s preferred speed, in a rural environment during a pilot study. Results indicate that an increase in speed is accompanied by a linear increase of subjective mental effort while lateral vehicle control deteriorates. Speed effects on EEG measures are diffused across locations and frequency bands, although within <b>subject</b> <b>contrast</b> revealed a linear power decrease with speed increase for all affected EEG measures. It is concluded these observations are promising for using EEG measures of mental effort in a implicit closed-loop biocybernetic system...|$|E

To this aim, quasi-monochromatic x-rays have been produced in the mammographic energy range by making use of a conventional W- anode, Be-window x-ray tube and a monochromator optical system based on an array of mosaic crystals. The mosaic crystals are highly oriented pyrolytic graphite which provide a gain in flux as compared to perfect crystals because of their higher integrated reflectivity. The monochromator optical system consists of an array of three crystals which has been assembled so as to produce in the image plane an irradiation field obtained with adjacent reflected beams.

This new technology uses flexible and re-usable storage phosphor plates {{that can be used}} in a fashion similar to film. To ensure that CR provides Probability of Detection (POD) performance for flaw indications that is equivalent to that of film radiography, international standards have been developed (ASTM E 2445 /E 2446 and CEN 14784 - 1 / 2) to govern the assessment of the image quality. These standards classify CR systems using the concept of normalized SNR (nSNR), which is based on the hypothesis that the SNR is inversely proportional to the basic spatial resolution (SR) of the system. Because of concerns that CR plates can have a lower spatial resolution than some industrial films, the above-mentioned standards specify the maximum SR depending on the penetrated thickness. However, in practice POD is primarily determined by the minimum <b>subject</b> <b>contrast</b> threshold that can be observed. The contrast threshold depends on many parameters including primary-to-scatter ratio, attenuation coefficient of the material, flaw geometry (globular, needle etc.), SNR, and the effective contrast modulation. Of these, the effective contrast modulation is the only parameter that depends on the system resolution. We present a model that estimates the relative importance of the different factors affecting the success of a radiographic technique. Only for very small globular flaws and materials with very high X-ray attenuation is the system resolution expected to be the limiting factor.

Comparatively, the image quality at the low doses studied was better for the film screen radiography than both processed and unprocessed CR images suggesting that low doses achieved in FSR may not be applicable to CR.   This difference {{may be attributed to}} the differences in the image receptors’ response to high photon energies, and the reduced number of x-ray quanta which produce lower <b>subject</b> <b>contrast</b> in FSR and reduced signal to noise ratio (SNR) as a result of increased noise in CR.

40|$|In an fMRI analysis, testing {{activation}} {{in each of}} over 100, 000 voxels induces a huge multiple testing problem. To {{guard against}} an explosion of false positives (FPs), thresholding is made very conservative but comes {{at the price of}} a problematic increase in false negatives (FNs). In their recent paper, Kang et al. (2015) propose a likelihood ratio (LR) approach that contrasts evidence in favor of true activation against evidence in favor of the null. They show how the likelihood paradigm (LP) controls average FP and FN error rates, decreasing FNs with only a slight increase in FPs. Their work is promising and a welcome contribution to the development of methods that not solely focus on classical null hypothesis testing but also take into account practical relevance. The authors acknowledge that the approach is specific to the effect size (ES) specified under the alternative and point out that this requires further research. They show that choosing an ES equal to a percentile between 90 th and 99 th of the contrast of interest is a possibility. In this note, we study the impact of choosing this ES in more detail. First want to raise awareness that the value of percentiles of estimated contrast values is highly dependent on the proportion of the brain activated by the task. For example, within the context of localizer tasks, we expect to pinpoint a single brain region and hence a small activated volume. The 95 percentile value would then lead to an underestimation of the true ES, since the ES of active voxels will be at the right tail of the ESs. Secondly, the LP measures evidence between two simple hypotheses (Blume, 2002). This requires valid estimation of the specified ES as both under- and overestimation of the true ES will result in a reduced LR for active voxels. Methods We simulated single <b>subject</b> <b>contrast</b> values maps (resolution: 32 × 32; voxel size 1 mm × 1 mm) with a proportion of q active voxels (ES = 2. 5 % BOLD). Gaussian noise {{with a standard deviation of}} 8 was added to the image, resulting in a CNR of 0. 32. The LR for each voxel was calculated as the likelihood of the data under the simple alternative with a specified ES divided by the likelihood of the data under the null. First, we let q vary from 0. 01 to 0. 99 and in each step used the 95 th percentile of the estimated contrasts as the specified ES. We demonstrate the effect of a varying q on the LR of one active voxel. Second, we set q = 0. 098 and let the specified ES vary from 0. 5 % to 4. 5 % BOLD. For dichotomous LP (dLP), all voxels having a LR larger or equal to k were retained. For continuous LP (cLP), inactive voxels had a LR smaller or equal to 1 /k, active voxels had a LR larger or equal to k and for weak evidence voxels, the LR was situated between 1 /k and k. Using contrast maps, we demonstrate the effect of under- or overestimating the true ES for k = 8. Results We show how the LR varies in function of the proportion of active voxels through variation in the specified ES. Evidence for activation is only convincing if the specified ES is close to the true ES (2. 5 % BOLD). Additionally, misspecifying the alternative hypothesis reduces the LR of the active voxels, resulting in more FNs. For cLP, many null voxels exhibit weak evidence when underestimating the true ES. Conclusions Kang et al. (2015) present a valuable approach for simultaneous control of error rates in fMRI data analysis. Our results demonstrate the importance of a correct specification of the alternative hypothesis. Voxels with an ES higher than the specified ES may exhibit a low LR and hence may show inconclusive evidence.
