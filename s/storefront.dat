5|$|Commercial {{building}} at 46 Third Street: Downtown Troy's only example of Streamline Moderne architecture. Having an enameled metal facade and <b>storefront,</b> and dating to 1940, {{it is the}} newest contributing property in the district.|$|E
5|$|In addition, a Colonel Sanders statue {{was taken}} from the <b>storefront</b> of a KFC in nearby Kōbe, and its hands were cut off {{supposedly}} in imitation of Sharia law.|$|E
5|$|Mukunda and Janaki met up {{with friends}} from college, who would later {{come to be known}} as Shyamasundar Das, Gurudas, Malati Dasi, and Yamuna Dasi. Teaming up with them, Mukunda rented a <b>storefront</b> in the San Francisco Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, which at that time was turning into the hub of the hippie counterculture, and stayed to take care of the {{developing}} new center.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1989 {{the police}} {{department}} had established 19 <b>storefronts</b> and planned to open 10 additional <b>storefronts</b> in 1990.|$|R
50|$|Artists {{can sell}} Tickets to their shows from their Nimbit <b>storefronts.</b> The event/show/gig {{information}} is entered once through the Nimbit Dashboard {{and then the}} etickets are automatically available on all <b>storefronts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The seven {{chapters}} {{that make}} up the 826 National network each feature uniquely themed <b>storefronts.</b> All proceeds from the <b>storefronts</b> go directly to various 826's free writing programs for under-resourced youth.|$|R
5|$|The Steam client {{includes}} a digital <b>storefront</b> called the Steam Store through which users can purchase computer games. Once {{the game is}} bought, a software license is permanently attached to the user's Steam account, allowing {{him or her to}} download the software on any compatible device. Game licenses can be given to other accounts under certain conditions. Content is delivered from an international network of servers using a proprietary file transfer protocol. Steam sells its products in US and Canadian dollars, euros, pounds sterling, Brazilian reais, Russian rubles, Indonesian rupiah and Indian rupees depending on the user's location. From December 2010, the client supports the Webmoney payment system, which is popular in many European, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries. Starting in April 2016, Steam began accepting payments in Bitcoin, valued based on the user's geolocation, with transactions handled by BitPay. The Steam <b>storefront</b> validates the user's region; the purchase of titles may be restricted to specific regions because of release dates, game classification, or agreements with publishers. Since 2010, the Steam Translation Server project offers Steam users to assist with the translation of the Steam client, <b>storefront,</b> and a selected library of Steam games for twenty-seven languages. Steam also allows users to purchase downloadable content for games, and for some specific game titles such as Team Fortress 2, the ability to purchase in-game inventory items. In February 2015, Steam began to open similar options for in-game item purchases for third-party games.|$|E
5|$|Beecher's Handmade Cheese is an artisan cheesemaker {{and retail}} shop with {{locations}} in the Pike Place Market, Seattle, Washington and New York City's Flatiron District. The company was founded by Kurt Beecher Dammeier in 2003 and opened in the Pike Place Market after Dammeier obtained a difficult to obtain <b>storefront</b> lease in the Market. Because Dammeier {{had never been a}} cheesemaker, he sought out the assistance of Brad Sinko, who helped run a family cheese-making business in Oregon. A second location was opened in 2011 in the Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City.|$|E
5|$|Developers {{are able}} to request Steam keys of their {{products}} to use as they see fit, such as to give away in promotions, to provide to selected users for review, or to give to key resellers for different profitization. Valve generally honors all such requests, but clarified that they would evaluate some requests to avoid giving keys to games or other offerings {{that are designed to}} manipulate the Steam <b>storefront</b> and other features. For example, Valve said that a request for 500,000 keys for a game that has significantly negative reviews and 1,000 sales on Steam is unlikely to be granted.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "most outstanding" [...] is the Brannen Building, on {{the south}} side of West Main St. running east from the corner of Walnut, which hosts a row of five <b>storefronts.</b> The <b>storefronts</b> have pressed metal pilasters and cornices.|$|R
5000|$|The Union Block is a three-story, brick Italianate {{commercial}} building containing two <b>storefronts.</b> The building measures 58 feet by 56 feet, and the roof gradually slopes {{from front to}} rear. The front facade has its original arched windows on the upper floors, and a cornice tops the facade. It {{is divided into two}} unequal <b>storefronts</b> - one three bays wide and one four bays wide - separated by a slightly projecting bay that originally had an open entryway leading to a stair accessing the upper floors. The <b>storefronts</b> were modernized in the 1950s, replacing the open entryway with a display window and combining the two <b>storefronts</b> into one, with a single recessed entrance.|$|R
50|$|Though it has {{a number}} of {{buildings}} of great architectural significance, downtown Newark has very few housing units and its <b>storefronts</b> are typically not well maintained. The buildings range from four to 35 stories tall presenting indiscriminate architecture. Many <b>storefronts</b> have enormous awnings.|$|R
5|$|New {{construction}} almost halted {{when the}} Great Depression {{began in the}} 1930s. As a result, there are few buildings in the district in that era's architectural styles. The post office at Fourth and Broadway, built despite much public outcry over the demolition of its landmark 1894 predecessor, is the district's most notable building of the 1930s. Its stripped-down Classical Revival style shows the influence of Art Deco in its smooth, finished surfaces. The enameled metal facade on a Third Street <b>storefront,</b> dating to 1940, makes it the only building in the district to show any trace of the Streamline Moderne style.|$|E
5|$|The Panic of 1873 put {{a damper}} on this growth, and in the interim the city's steel {{industry}} began to decline, squeezed by competition from newer, more efficient producers in Western Pennsylvania and the Midwest on one side and labor unrest at home. But the textile industry remained strong, and even grew. Accordingly, its residents continued to embrace new movements in architecture. The 1880 pharmacy building at 137 Second Street featured a highly decorated cast iron <b>storefront</b> and curved windows showing the influence of the Queen Anne Style. Further down Second Street, industrialist Jonas Heartt's house built that same year {{is one of the best}} residential applications of the same style.|$|E
5|$|Two men, Brad and Ryan, {{wake up in}} a {{metropolitan}} <b>storefront</b> window, bound at the wrists to opposite sides of a worktable with a circular saw {{in front of each}} of them. Their mutual lover, Dina, is suspended above a third saw. As the scene draws attention and police arrive, a puppet informs the men that they can kill each other or let Dina die. They initially fight each other, during which Brad is cut, but ultimately choose to allow Dina to die instead.|$|E
5000|$|Unnamed {{building}}, 109-117 Canfield (1918) This {{building has}} three <b>storefronts.</b> The corner store housed Jewish-owned pharmacy from 1929 to 1957. The {{building is a}} one-story, red brick Commercial Style building with flat roof. The three <b>storefronts</b> are tied together by a common parapet.|$|R
50|$|The Fairman Building is {{a three-story}} {{rectangular}} red brick Italianate commercial block. It {{is located at}} the intersection of Maple and South Michigan, and has two main facades, with five three-bay <b>storefronts</b> and single-bay entryway to the upper floors on South Michigan and four three-bay <b>storefronts</b> on Maple. The facade is accentuated with buff colored brick work at the corners. A metal cornice supported with brackets runs across the top; the brackets provide a delineation between the <b>storefronts</b> on each facade.|$|R
50|$|As {{designed}} by Parkinson & Bergstrom, the Metropolitan Building was a dignified building with handsomely appointed public spaces and multiple retail <b>storefronts.</b> Despite exterior alterations to the <b>storefronts</b> and main entrance, the building retains sufficient integrity of design, material and workmanship, to maintain significance under criterion C.|$|R
5|$|Argo {{opened its}} {{flagship}} New York City location in January 2010 by signing a 10-year lease in the Flatiron Building. It promptly {{followed with a}} Chelsea neighborhood <b>storefront</b> and then a Columbus Circle store in the spring. It opened {{a total of four}} cafes in New York City in 2010, taking advantage of the late-2000s recession, which allowed the company to procure prime retail locations such as Union Square, Columbus Circle and the Flatiron District at reasonable rates. The business replaced a Dean & Deluca in the Union Square neighborhood. Among the investors in the New York City expansion were Sam Zell, Glen Tullman and Oxford Capital. In May 2011, the company added its fifth tea room in New York City.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, the European Commission began {{investigating}} Valve {{and five}} other publishers—Bandai Namco Entertainment, Capcom, Focus Home Interactive, Koch Media and ZeniMax Media—for anti-competitive practices, specifically the use of geo-blocking through the Steam <b>storefront</b> and Steam product keys to prevent access to software to citizens of certain countries. Such practices would be against the Digital Single Market initiative set by the European Union. The French gaming trade group, Syndicat National du Jeu Vidéo, noted that geo-blocking was a necessary feature to hinder inappropriate product key reselling, where a group buys a number of keys in regions where the cost is low, and then resells them into regions of much higher value to profit on the difference, outside of European oversight and tax laws.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, Moore {{signed a}} record deal with The Firm, a record label run by EMI. The singer's fifth studio album, Wild Hope, was {{released}} in June 2007. A departure from her previous style, Moore incorporated folk and acoustic music into the album. The album peaked at number thirty on the Billboard 200 chart {{and went on to}} sell about 109,000 copies in the US. In May 2009, Moore's sixth studio album, Amanda Leigh, was released through <b>Storefront</b> Recordings. Following the same musical style as Wild Hope, the album's title was taken from Moore's full name. It debuted at number twenty-five on the Billboard 200 and has sold 16,000 copies in the US, as of June 2009. The singles from Wild Hope and Amanda Leigh were commercially unsuccessful and failed to chart.|$|E

5|$|Milk's {{continuing}} campaign, {{run from}} the <b>storefront</b> of Castro Camera, was a study in disorganization. Although the older Irish grandmothers and gay men who volunteered were plentiful and happy to send out mass mailings, Milk's notes and volunteer lists were kept on scrap papers. Any time the campaign required funds, the money came from the cash register without any consideration for accounting. The campaign manager's assistant was an 11-year-old neighborhood girl. Milk himself was hyperactive and prone to fantastic outbursts of temper, only to recover quickly and shout excitedly about something else. Many of his rants were directed at his lover, Scott Smith, who was becoming disillusioned {{with the man who}} was no longer the laid-back hippie he had fallen in love with.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, the Multnomah County Library began distributing {{books to}} neighborhoods outside {{downtown}} Portland. A reading room {{was established in}} the Woodstock neighborhood's fire station building in 1908; later that year it was recognized as a branch of Multnomah County Library. Deposit stations, containing packing crates that turned into two-shelf bookcases holding up to 50 books each, were often set up within fire stations or private homes. Woodstock received its deposit station, a collection of children's books housed within a public school, in 1909, becoming one of fifteen outlying service areas. On May 16, 1911, the Woodstock deposit station was replaced by a sub-branch library, supplying more reading material for adults and children but without the reference works and other library services offered at regular branches. The collection was moved to a larger <b>storefront</b> facility, west of SE 44th on SE Woodstock Boulevard, on September 12, 1914. The library achieved full branch status in 1917, offering a collection and services comparable to other branches. In 1918, the Woodstock branch and several others were threatened with closure after employees received a $10 per month salary increase, but funding sources helped to defray the additional expense. Along with other county libraries, the branch closed between November 1 and November 16 in response to the 1918 flu pandemic.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, Steam {{introduced}} non-gaming applications, {{which are}} sold through the {{service in the}} same manner as games. Creativity and productivity applications can access the core functions of the Steamworks API, allowing them to use Steam's simplified installation and updating process, and incorporate features including cloud saving and Steam Workshop. Steam also allows game soundtracks to be purchased to be played via Steam Music or integrated with the user's other media players. Valve have also added the ability for publishers to rent and sell digital movies via the service, with initially most being video game documentaries. Following Warner Bros. Entertainment offering the Mad Max films alongside the September 2015 release of the 2015 game based on the series, Lionsgate entered into agreement with Valve to rent over one hundred feature films from its catalog through Steam starting in April 2016, with more films following later. In March 2017, Crunchyroll started offering various anime for purchase or rent through Steam. With the onset of Steam Machines, the Steam <b>storefront</b> also includes the ability to purchase Steam Machine-related hardware.|$|E
50|$|The Pinkston-Mays Store Building is a {{historic}} commercial building at 107-109 Lackston Street in Lowell, Arkansas. It is a two-story brick building with a flat roof, and {{is divided into two}} <b>storefronts,</b> separated by a stairway leading to the second floor. The two <b>storefronts</b> are arranged identically, with a central entrance flanked by fixed glass windows. The elements of the first floor facade are separated by brick pilaster, and the <b>storefronts</b> are highlighted by brick corbelling above. Built in 1902, the building is a little-altered local example of early 20th century commercial architecture.|$|R
2500|$|The main {{lobby is}} {{accessed}} from Fifth Avenue, on the building's east side, and contains an entrance with {{one set of}} double doors between a pair of revolving doors. At {{the top of each}} doorway is a bronze motif of three of the [...] "crafts or industries" [...] used in the building's construction—Electricity, Masonry, and Heating from north to south. The lobby contains two tiers of marble: a lighter marble on the top, above the <b>storefronts,</b> and a darker marble on the bottom, flush with the <b>storefronts.</b> There is a pattern of zigzagging terrazzo tiles on the lobby floor, which leads from the entrance on the east to the aluminum relief on the west. The chapel-like three-story-high lobby, which runs parallel to 33rd and 34th Streets, contains <b>storefronts</b> on both its northern and southern sides. These <b>storefronts</b> are framed by tubes of dark, [...] "modernistically rounded marble", and above the <b>storefronts</b> is a vertical band of grooves set into the marble. Immediately inside the lobby is an airport-style security checkpoint.|$|R

5|$|In mid-1967, New York City mayor John Lindsay {{sought to}} develop closer ties {{with leaders of}} impoverished neighborhoods. Prompted in part by {{concerns}} voiced by the New York Police Department (NYPD), the mayor dispatched one of his aides, Barry Gottehrer, to meet with Clarence13X. Belying his fearsome reputation, Clarence13X had a congenial meeting with Gottehrer, during which he requested more bus routes and school funding. Clarence13X subsequently attended a meeting of black leaders at Gracie Mansion, the mayor's official residence. The city provided buses for Five Percenters to travel to a Long Island park, and {{with help from the}} National Urban League, obtained an abandoned <b>storefront</b> for use as a school. It became known as the Allah School in Mecca and aimed to prepare young people for college preparatory schools. Tensions soon formed between the Five Percenters and the school's overseers; Clarence13X desired more control over the curriculum and had difficulty finding qualified teachers. Police regularly visited the school to ensure that the students were not being radicalized. In 1975, Gottehrer chronicled his friendship with Clarence13X in The Mayor's Man. The book was well received by some Five Percenters, who republished portions of it after it went out of print. They have not reprinted the entire book, owing to a passage in which Gottehrer relates that Clarence13X offered to allow him to sleep with his teenage daughter.|$|E
5|$|New mixes will {{be added}} {{regularly}} to DJ Hero through downloadable content that can be purchased on the console's respective online stores; content was made available {{on the day of}} the game's release. Unlike Guitar Hero games' downloadable content, which costs approximately US$2 per track, each mix costs approximately $3 to download because of the additional effort needed to create the mixes. Furthermore, mixes are provided only as bundles for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 users; the Wii's <b>storefront</b> prevents the selling of bundled packages; instead, each track is offered individually. Critics viewed the lack of individual song selection on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms as a way of limiting consumers' choice, as previous downloadable songs for games such as Guitar Hero allow players on these systems to select individual tracks to purchase from a bundle. The long time between the second downloadable pack (in November 2009) and the third pack (in March 2010) was also believed to be the result of a last-ditch effort by Activision to support the game, and that the few packs released did not meet expectations for the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{shopping}} center {{is expected to}} include Bebe, Coach and J.Crew. Lettuce Entertain You who also operates the food court at Water Tower Place will operate a cafe, food court and market. The top floor was to be occupied by Muvico Theaters, however they pulled out in 2009. The David Barton Gym, the first and largest tenant of the Block 37 project, has {{pulled out of the}} project favoring, instead, the Roosevelt Collection in the south loop. The reason the gym opted out was the delayed opening of the mall, which is scheduled for fall 2009 opening rather than fall 2008 as scheduled. In March 2009, Apple Inc. also withdrew from its leasing agreement, and less than a month later it signed an agreement to develop a new <b>storefront</b> in the Clybourn Corridor on property bounded by North Avenue, Halsted Street and Clybourn Avenue. After Apple backed out of its lease, Lululemon backed out of its lease to be located next to Apple. Other March 2009 tenant signings included Chicago's haberdashery Bigsby & Kruthers, Sunglass Hut, crystal jewelers Swarovski, Starfruit Cafe, and Fast-casual eatery Tahini. Also, in the face of declining advertising revenue, CBS sought to sublease part of its studio. A Loews Hotel will be built in forthcoming years.|$|E
