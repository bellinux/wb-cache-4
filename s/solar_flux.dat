We have found that a distinct lower peak cannot be reproduced by scaling the <b>solar</b> <b>fluxes</b> below 250 Å by a constant factor of 3 [...] 6.

The rate of photon absorption depends upon the absorption spectrum of the sensitized TiO2 layer and upon the <b>solar</b> <b>flux</b> spectrum. The overlap between these two spectra determines the maximum possible photocurrent. Typically used dye molecules generally have poorer absorption in the red part of the spectrum compared to silicon, which means that fewer of the photons in sunlight are usable for current generation.

2500|$|Skywave propagation, also {{referred}} to as skip, is any of the modes that rely on reflection (actually refraction) of radio waves from the ionosphere. [...] The ionosphere is [...] a region of the atmosphere from about 60km (37mi) to 500km (310mi) that contains layers of charged particles (ions) which can refract a radio wave back toward the Earth. [...] A radio wave directed at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth beyond the horizon by these layers, allowing long distance radio transmission. The F2 layer is the most important ionospheric layer for long-distance, multiple-hop HF propagation, though F1, E, and D-layers also play significant roles. The D-layer, when present during sunlight periods, causes significant amount of signal loss, as does the E-layer whose maximum usable frequency can rise to 4MHz and above and thus block higher frequency signals from reaching the F2-layer. The layers, or more appropriately [...] "regions", are directly affected by the sun on a daily diurnal cycle, a seasonal cycle and the 11-year sunspot cycle and determine the utility of these modes. During solar maxima, or sunspot highs and peaks, the whole HF range up to 30MHz can be used usually around the clock and F2 propagation up to 50MHz is observed frequently depending upon daily <b>solar</b> <b>flux</b> 10.7cm radiation values.
