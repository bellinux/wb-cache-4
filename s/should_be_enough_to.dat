25|$|I return herewith, under {{separate}} cover, the 'Pearl of Great Price.' The 'Book of Abraham,' it {{is hardly}} necessary to say, is a pure fabrication. Cuts 1 and 3 are inaccurate copies of well known scenes on funeral papyri, and cut 2 is a copy {{of one of the}} magical discs which in the late Egyptian period were placed under the heads of mummies. There were about forty of these latter known in museums and they are all very similar in character. Joseph Smith's interpretation of these cuts is a farrago of nonsense from beginning to end. Egyptian characters can now be read almost as easily as Greek, and five minutes' study in an Egyptian gallery of any museum <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> convince any educated man of the clumsiness of the imposture.|$|E

He wrote: [...] "Under the enormous pressure of her $40 million deal with Virgin Records, Jackson had to deliver something big enough to put her {{on a first-name basis}} with the world... 'janet.' isn't perfect, but it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make her the Queen of Pop." [...] "Dammit, Janet!," [...] marveled Melody Maker. [...] "The last Jackson hero(ine) has carried peacock feathers to the dance. Holier than Mahalia." [...] "Janet will please most people," [...] remarked The Daily Telegraph, [...] "because it is crammed with the sort of tender, joyous pop music that lingers long after smarter records have been forgotten." ...|$|E
500|$|A [...] segment from Medicine Hat to west of Severn Persons was {{completed}} in 1973, with grading for another 21.7km west of Seven Persons done in 1974. [...] Several local Social Credit Party Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) expressed dissatisfaction with {{the rate at which}} the work was progressing and the reasoning given by Highways Minister Clarence Copithorne. [...] He cited a labour shortage and the fact that provincial funds were being spread across multiple projects, and also the fact that drivers should not be subjected to overly lengthy construction zones. [...] The MLAs disagreed, saying that Alberta's oil and gas revenue <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> expedite Highway3 work, and that their constituents preferred for the work to be done sooner even if it meant longer stretches of the road would be under construction at a given time.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} watched by 8.3 million viewers, the twelfth most-watched {{programme}} of the week, with an Appreciation Index score of 85%. Jacob Clifton of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A+ rating, and jokingly {{stated that he}} [...] "didn't know why the Doctor was fucking around : he taught Physics at Coal Hill School way back in '63". Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode an 8.7 out of 10 ("Great") and commented that the episode had [...] "fantastic character moments" [...] and [...] "brilliant CGI effects", and that [...] "if you're {{willing to accept the}} Scooby-Doo storyline, then the strong nostalgic vibes present in this episode <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> carry this episode into a must-see category.", and K9 and Sarah-Jane alone made the episode worth watching for fans of the classic series. The episode was subsequently nominated for the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form, an award that was won by the following episode [...] "The Girl in the Fireplace".|$|E
500|$|In response, Duchesne gave what Nosanchuk writes was a [...] "well-reasoned argument", {{which the}} jury paid rapt {{attention}} to. Duchesne {{declared that the}} incident had been the cold, calculated murder of a defenceless group of innocent young people by an ex-convict, released only three weeks earlier and already known as an anti-social psychopath. The defendant had given wildly conflicting stories to different doctors, Duchesne said, yet had convinced each one. Duchesne {{said that this was}} possible as Lamb was highly intelligent and able to project a false front if it suited him. The prosecutor then moved off the topic of Lamb's mental state and focussed on the matter of criminal responsibility in general. Five out of the eight psychiatrists in the court, the prosecutor said, had testified that Lamb had understood on an intellectual level that shooting Chaykoski and Woloch would kill them, which he asserted <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> incur criminal responsibility, even taking the psychiatric evidence into account. Finding Lamb {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity, he reasoned, would provide an inexpedient precedent in Canadian law and cause a spate of similar insanity defence attempts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{generally}} well received by critics. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album for proving that they're [...] "stronger and {{more serious than}} many of their post-grunge peers" [...] and concluding that [...] "there's not quite enough of it this time around to make Blue the equal of its predecessor, but it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> please devoted fans." [...] James Hunter of Rolling Stone similarly praised the album for its [...] "finely worked-out chunks of serious gun-metal rockcraft that depend on the San Francisco band's restless, edgy electric guitars" [...] {{and concluded that the}} album was a rarity in the way it [...] "works best as either background rock or intimate headphone material." [...] Elysa Gardner of Entertainment Weekly noted Jenkins' lyrics and vocal delivery and Cadogan's guitar-work as standout elements of the album.|$|E

2500|$|Metropolis {{features}} {{a range of}} elaborate special effects and set designs, ranging from a huge gothic cathedral to a futuristic cityscape. In an interview, Fritz Lang reported that [...] "the film was born from my first sight of the skyscrapers in New York in October 1924". He had visited New York {{for the first time}} and remarked [...] "I looked into the streets – the glaring lights and the tall buildings – and there I conceived Metropolis." [...] Describing his first impressions of the city, Lang said that [...] "the buildings seemed to be a vertical sail, scintillating and very light, a luxurious backdrop, suspended in the dark sky to dazzle, distract and hypnotize". He added [...] "The sight of Neuyork [...] alone <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> turn this beacon of beauty into the center of a film..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Game Informer {{gave the}} game {{a rating of}} 8.75 out of 10, writing [...] "a number of new {{features}} have been attempted to make Revelations feel new and different from its predecessors. In that quest for broader variety and a unique identity from the earlier games, Revelations makes some missteps {{that are hard to}} ignore. However, the game offers more of what has been great about the franchise, and that <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> bring most fans to the table, even if it a poor starting point for new players." [...] GameTrailers also gave the game a rating of 8.8 out of 10, saying that [...] "the engine is a bit long in the tooth and some of the content isn't entirely worth exploring, but if you're looking for an unforgettable top shelf action/adventure, heed the creed." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the subject}} of suicide, Hauerwas {{challenges}} the claim that autonomous suicide is morally acceptable, but also wants to distinguish himself from the position that denies rational suicide. He believes that suicide can be and often is a rational decision of an “autonomous” agent, but does {{not agree with the}} notion that it is justified. He contends that suicide as an institution must be considered morally doubtful, as the life that we are given should be considered a gift bestowed upon us by God. To many, the term [...] "rational suicide" [...] {{is based on the assumption}} that the decision to live or die depends on whether life has a meaning or purpose. Hauerwas, however, contends that the reason we should live on, is because our lives are not ours, and as such, reminds us that there is a commitment to keep on living. Yet, while there may be times in our lives where suicide may seem rational, mere existence allows us to enjoy certain joys, such as helping another, or healing the sick, that <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> sustain our commitment to living.|$|E

2500|$|He {{rejected}} the respondents' position that [...] "an employer's good-faith belief that its actions {{are necessary to}} comply with Title VII's disparate-impact provision <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> justify race-conscious conduct." [...] This position would ignore [...] "the original, foundational prohibition of Title VII," [...] which bars employers from taking adverse action [...] "because of... race." [...] §2000e–2(a)(1); and when Congress codified the disparate-impact provision in 1991, it made no exception to disparate-treatment liability for actions taken in a good-faith effort {{to comply with the}} new, disparate-impact provision in subsection (k). Respondents' policy would encourage race-based action at the slightest hint of disparate impact— e.g. causing employers to discard the results of lawful and beneficial promotional examinations even where there is little if any evidence of disparate-impact discrimination— which would amount to a de facto quota system, in which a [...] "focus on statistics... could put undue pressure on employers to adopt inappropriate prophylactic measures." [...] "That operational principle could not be justified, for Title VII is express in disclaiming any interpretation of its requirements as calling for outright racial balancing." [...] §2000e–2(j). The purpose of Title VII [...] "is to promote hiring on the basis of job qualifications, rather than {{on the basis of race}} or color." ...|$|E
2500|$|January Jones plays Emma Frost/White Queen in , {{released}} by Fox on June 3, 2011. She {{is a powerful}} telepath as well as possessing her diamond skin, and is the consort of Sebastian Shaw, the villainous leader of the Hellfire Club who seeks to start a nuclear war between the Soviet Union and United States. This would eradicate all non-mutant life and mutate any survivors, leaving the Hellfire Club to rule over this new world order. Charles Xavier, Erik Lehnsherr, and their team of teenage mutants thwart their plan, and Emma is incarcerated, though she is freed by Erik, who {{is now known as}} Magneto, {{at the end of the}} film. In this film, she is able to completely block Xavier from using his telepathy on her and Shaw, create illusions, perform mental torture, as well as sense the initial activation of Cerebro from thousands of miles away. While in diamond form, she shows absolute immunity towards psychic attack and has enhanced strength, durability, and reflexes, able to easily cut through glass and glacial ice, catch a throwing knife, and punch Magneto off a boat and into the sea. However, Erik uses his powers to choke her with a metal bar to get information out of her while in her diamond form. This caused massive cracks in her body while in that form, and after she reverts to flesh and blood, he implies a single tap <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> shatter her completely should she morph.|$|E
