40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 5 FEB 2014 The strength of high-frequency radio signals, when refracted by the ionosphere, can be {{strongly influenced by}} <b>ionospheric</b> <b>absorption.</b> Accurate modeling {{of the amount of}} this absorption is a vital part of many studies of radio waves propagating in the ionosphere. We have developed a new, flexible model of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>absorption,</b> the Semiempirical Model for <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Absorption</b> based on the NRLMSISE- 00 atmospheric model (SiMIAN). This article describes the methods and formulae used by SiMIAN, a comparison of SiMIAN with an older absorption model, and validation work performed by simulating the power returned in vertical incidence soundings of the ionosphere and comparing the results with real soundings.

It was found that sharp increases in <b>ionospheric</b> <b>absorption</b> are mainly due to solar protons emission with an energy greater than 10 MeV.

40|$|Data {{acquired}} {{with the}} Geophysics Laboratory's high-latitude meteor scatter test-bed between Sondrestrom Air Base (AB) and Thule AB, Greenland, during the solar disturbances of March and August 1989 are presented. These disturbances provided {{a unique opportunity}} to observe a number of naturally occurring disturbance effects on meteor scatter links operated in the frequency range (35 to 147 MHz) covered by the test-bed. The disturbances range from signal absorption to system noise variations. The properties of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>absorption</b> in general are discussed and illustrated with computations using electron density profiles from the September 1978 solar proton event (SPE). It has been found that accurate measurements of high levels of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>absorption</b> with riometers pose special problems. These problems are identified and discussed. The data acquired during the March and August 1989 solar disturbances are then related to the zenith absorption measured at Thule, and the influence of absorption as well as system noise variations are discussed. The two events presented are very different. The August event was dominated by <b>ionospheric</b> <b>absorption</b> which affected meteor arrival rates and duty cycles primarily at the lower frequencies (35 and 45 MHz), although some effects could also be seen at the higher frequencies (65 to 147 MHz). The March event combined weak <b>ionospheric</b> <b>absorption</b> with large solar noise bursts. The effects of this event on the test-bed were dominated by increased solar noise at all frequencies. The relative influence of solar noise and <b>ionospheric</b> <b>absorption</b> during SPE events is discussed along with speculation as to the validity of frequency dependence conclusions based on testing of the JANET system...|$|R

5000|$|A {{riometer}} (commonly relative ionospheric opacity meter, although originally: Relative Ionospheric Opacity Meter for Extra-Terrestrial Emissions of Radio noise) is {{an instrument}} used {{to quantify the}} amount of electromagnetic-wave <b>ionospheric</b> <b>absorption</b> in the atmosphere. As the name implies, a riometer measures the [...] "opacity" [...] of the ionosphere to radio noise emanating from cosmic origin. In {{the absence of any}} <b>ionospheric</b> <b>absorption,</b> this radio noise, averaged over a sufficiently long period of time, forms a quiet-day curve. Increased ionization in the ionosphere will cause absorption of radio signals (both terrestrial and extraterrestrial), and a departure from the quiet-day curve. The difference between the quiet-day curve and the riometer signal is an indicator of the amount of absorption, and is measured in decibels. Riometers are generally passive radio antenna operating in the VHF radio frequency range (~30-40 MHz). Electromagnetic radiation of that frequency is typically Galactic synchrotron radiation and is absorbed in the Earth's D region of the ionosphere.|$|R

It could be shown that the energy transfer function ε as introduced by PERREAULT and AKASOFU (Geophys. J. R. Astron. Soc., 54, 547, 1978) is a good quantity to describe the energy transfer from the solar wind into the magnetosphere and ionosphere as demonstrated by {{a comparison of the}} longterm variation of ε with the variation of the geomagnetic Ap-index and the excessive particle-induced absorption in mid-latitudes. A correlation analysis confirms also the significant connection between hourly values of different geomagnetic indices and of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>absorption</b> data from high latitudes with the energy transfer function ε and suggests a time delay of particle injection into the magnetospheric ring current and the precipitation into the ionosphere of about one hour in relation to ε. Investigations of individual geomagnetic storms in midlatitudes demonstrate that the particle precipitation during the main phase of the storm is markedly controlled by the energy transfer function, whereas during the post-storm phase the internal magnetospheric processes play an important role, too...|$|R

It is concluded that the absorption due to such irregularities with a mean-square fractional electron density deviation greater than about 0. 000001 exceeds the normal collisional height-integrated absorption.

40|$|Studies {{were made}} of inter-relations among VLF-ELF-ULF radio noises, <b>ionospheric</b> <b>absorption,</b> {{geomagnetic}} variations and aurora at the South Pole, Byrd and Eights Stations, Antarctica. Semi-diurnal peaks in the above geophysical parameters were found : these peaks occurred {{within a few hours}} before magnetic noon and others a few hours before magnetic midnight. A geophysical event which takes place in the day sector is called a D (day) event and night sector an N (night) event. The N event is similar to AKASOFU 2 ̆ 7 s substorm. One N event consists of three phases called N- 1,N- 2 and N- 3. Early in the evening the N- 1 is the major part of the N event. In mid-evening, three phases co-exist. The N- 3 is the dominant feature of the late evening N event. Observations made by the Injun III satellite showed that VLF hiss (main feature of the N- 1) was observed at the boundary and beyond the region of trapped electrons in the dark sector. VLF chorus (main feature of N- 3) was observed in the closed lines of force. From the above observations, we suggest that the physical characteristics of auroral zone are asymmetric with respect to the day-night major axis. VLF hiss and band-type aurora are the main features of the evening side (N- 1). VLF chorus, <b>ionospheric</b> <b>absorption,</b> ULF and patchy and surface-like aurora are characteristics of a post-midnight region (N- 3).

However, at intermediate latitudes riometer absorption maximizes during the fall season, whereas the A 1 data show a semi-annual variation with maxima occurring in summer and winter.

40|$|Ionospheric {{disturbances}} {{associated with}} magnetospheric substorms were detected with VLF (ƒ= 10. 2 and 13. 6 kHz) {{radio wave propagation}} and a riometer simultaneously at Syowa Station, Antarctica. It is shown that the phase of the OMEGA REUNION signals (10. 2 and 13. 6 kHz, La Reunion) advances significantly in association with geomagnetic bays and <b>ionospheric</b> <b>absorptions.</b> In correspondence to these disturbances, VLF phase anomalies are also observed on the OMEGA ALDRA signal (13. 6 kHz, Aldra, Norway) as received at Inubo, Japan. The conjugacy of occurrence of the VLF phase anomalies in {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres indicates that ionospheric disturbances responsible for VLF phase anomalies are caused by precipitation of energetic electrons from the magnetosphere. Local time characteristics of VLF phase and absorption anomalies are obtained from data recorded during a period from September 1, 1980 to January 31, 1981. Precipitation of energetic electrons responsible for VLF phase anomalies takes place predominantly in the evening sector peaked around 22 MLT, whereas electron precipitation responsible for absorption anomalies takes place in the morning sector peaked around 0230 and 0730 MLT. The discrepancy in these local time characteristics is due to a difference in height of the ionosphere responsible for the VLF phase anomaly (h 30 keV and VLF phase anomalies by more energetic electrons with energies> 300 keV. This conclusion is confirmed qualitatively by observational facts that a significant phase anomaly is observed on the REUNION (10. 2 kHz) signal which is reflected from the lowermost part of the ionosphere, whereas no corresponding disturbances either on the REUNION (13. 6 kHz) signal and in <b>ionospheric</b> <b>absorption...</b>|$|R
