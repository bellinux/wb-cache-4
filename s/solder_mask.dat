Gerber is also the standard image input format for all bare board fabrication equipment needing image data, such as photoplotters, legend printers, direct imagers or automated optical inspection (AOI) machines and for viewing reference images in different departments. For assembly the fabrication data contains the solder paste layers and the central locations of components to create the stencil and place and bond the components.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{reflective}} {{properties of}} white <b>solder</b> <b>masks</b> {{are subject to}} this investigation. Selected materials were used to fabricate test boards with increasing solder resist thickness, ranging from 1 to 4 layers. Reflectivity and reflectivity loss were measured, and some visual and mechanical properties. Our main conclusion is that high reflective white <b>solder</b> <b>masks</b> appear suitable for optical mixing design-in for lighting systems. The main route {{seems to be to}} print a first layer of a white photosensitive solder resist, which will define the component footprint for soldering; followed by multiple layers of a screen printed, thermal curable white resist, with slightly bigger opening, which will give the needed reflectivity and stability. Reflectivity increases with increasing layer thickness from 87 - 90 % for one layer of 20 µm to 95 % for four layers or 80 µm. Reflectivity loss up to 10 % is observed in the blue spectrum after heat treatment for 1000 hrs at 100 ºC...|$|R

50|$|New {{management}} {{shed the}} unprofitable low-end business to refocus on the mid- range, more technologically complex {{segment of the}} market. These changes were made in time to capture some explosive growth. Historically, the PCB market had grown about 6% a year, but from 1995-2000 it grew at 10%. By 2000, the company's sales had increased to $30 million.

40|$|In microelectronic {{packaging}} technologies organic {{thin film}} materials, e. g. photo resists acting as dielectric layers or <b>solder</b> <b>masks,</b> gain {{more and more}} importance due to trends towards miniaturization and high system integration. Therefore, a profound characterization of these materials {{is an important issue}} for reliable FEM simulations and improved process control. In this paper, viscoelastic material behavior of dielectric polymer thin films is characterized in time and frequency domain and implemented into ANSYS. The FEM results are compared to relaxation experiments for consistency check and it was found that material models from frequency data simulate a stiffer long term material behavior compared to data from time domain. The latter showed good agreement with accordant experiments. In addition to the standard macroscopic material characterization methods we initiated the steps towards a local microscopic material characterization method on device level using na noindentation technique. The indentation creep compliance of organic thin films was measured and compared to standard methods. The advantage of analyzing in a small volume scale is to consider material characteristics of real processed thin films with thermal load histories as they appear in final products...|$|R
50|$|The ideal PCBA {{manufacturing}} test covers (that is, successfully detects) any defect(s) {{present from}} the entire PCBA manufacturing test defect universe. However, in practice {{it is almost impossible}} to test for 100% of the PCBA manufacturing defect universe due to electrical and imaging test limitations and tradeoffs. The electrical process test challenges can range from the lack of access(test pads) to components in parallel circuits (for example, hundreds of small capacitors in parallel across power and ground planes). Imaging test challenges can be component(s) and solder joints hidden by RF shielding, small outline surface mount device (SMD) (e.g. 01005) under a larger SMD (e.g. ball grid array (BGA)) and even hidden <b>solder</b> joints <b>masked</b> by underside heat sinks or another solder joints. Thus, each test technology has significant ‘blind spots’, and a goal is to combine technologies to more effectively eliminate untested defects.|$|R

2500|$|The Lockerbie {{judgment}} stated: [...] "From {{the evidence}} {{which we have}} discussed so far, we are satisfied {{that it has been}} proved that the primary suitcase containing the explosive device was dispatched from Malta, passed through Frankfurt and was loaded onto PA103 at Heathrow. It is, as we have said, clear that, with one exception the clothing in the primary suitcase was the clothing purchased in Mr Gauci's shop on 7 December 1988. The purchaser was, on Mr Gauci's evidence, a Libyan. The trigger for the explosion was an MST-13 timer of the single <b>solder</b> <b>mask</b> variety. A substantial quantity of such timers had been supplied to Libya. We cannot say that it is impossible that the clothing might have been taken from Malta, united somewhere with a timer from some source other than Libya and introduced into the airline baggage system at Frankfurt or Heathrow. When, however, the evidence regarding the clothing, the purchaser and the timer is taken with the evidence that an unaccompanied bag was taken from KM180 to PA103A, the inference that that was the primary suitcase becomes, in our view, irresistible. As we have also said, the absence of an explanation as to how the suitcase was taken into the system at Luqa is a major difficulty for the Crown case, but after taking full account of that difficulty, we remain of the view that the primary suitcase began its journey at Luqa. The clear inference which we draw from this evidence is that the conception, planning and execution of the plot which led to the planting of the explosive device was of Libyan origin. While no doubt organisations such as the PFLP-GC and the PPSF were also engaged in terrorist activities during the same period, we are satisfied that there was no evidence from which we could infer that they were involved in this particular act of terrorism, and the evidence relating to their activities does not create a reasonable doubt in our minds about the Libyan origin of this crime." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Solder</b> <b>mask</b> {{comes in}} {{different}} media {{depending upon the}} demands of the application. The lowest-cost <b>solder</b> <b>mask</b> is epoxy liquid that is silkscreened through the pattern onto the PCB. Other types are the liquid photoimageable <b>solder</b> <b>mask</b> (LPSM or LPI) inks and dry film photoimageable <b>solder</b> <b>mask</b> (DFSM). LPSM can be silkscreened or sprayed on the PCB, exposed to the pattern and developed to provide openings in the pattern for parts to be soldered to the copper pads. DFSM is vacuum laminated on the PCB then exposed and developed. All three processes typically go through a thermal cure of some type after the pattern is defined although LPI solder masks are also available in Ultra Violet (UV) cure.|$|E
40|$|<b>Solder</b> paste <b>masks</b> or stencils are an {{integral}} part of the manufacturing process for surface mount PCBs. This study examines the feasibility of a process for rapid creation of a solder paste stencil using thermoplastic material. CNC laser cutting of the stencil geometry is replacing traditional use of chemical etching on metal sheets to produce stencils. Laser cutting has been used to improve process speed, accuracy, and cost. This research attempts to continue to simplify and reduce costs in the stencil making process by proposing as the stencil material a common thermoplastic that can be cut easily and quickly using a low-power rapid-prototyping laser process. The effects of several variables on the success of the process are experimentally tested to determine a feasible solution. Various solder pastes and solder material characteristics are studied for their effect on the new material. Stencil dimensions, including thickness and aperture characteristics, are examined. Several key process factors are also varied in the tests to determine recommendations for settings such as print direction, alignment procedures, squeegee pressure and attack angle, print speed, and stencil release method. Subjective evaluation is also made of important qualities of the paste in reaction to the new material, including paste roll and consistency, paste volume, adherence, and instances of cold slumping. The resulting process is demonstrated by producing plastic stencils on a rapid prototyping laser housed in the Cal Poly laboratories. Cost, cycle time, and performance characteristics of the plastic stencil are estimated...|$|R

50|$|<b>Solder</b> <b>mask</b> or solder stop mask or {{solder resist}} {{is a thin}} lacquer-like layer of polymer that is usually applied to the copper traces of {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) for {{protection}} against oxidation and to prevent solder bridges from forming between closely spaced solder pads. A solder bridge is an unintended electrical connection between two conductors by means of a small blob of solder. PCBs use solder masks to prevent this from happening. <b>Solder</b> <b>mask</b> is not always used for hand soldered assemblies, but is essential for mass-produced boards that are soldered automatically using reflow or solder bath techniques. Once applied, openings must be made in the <b>solder</b> <b>mask</b> wherever components are soldered, which is accomplished using photolithography. <b>Solder</b> <b>mask</b> is traditionally green but is now available in many colors.|$|E

50|$|The {{required}} accuracy in alignment {{can also be}} achieved by controlling the flow of solder on the PWB during reflow soldering. For this purpose, {{the space between the}} pads is often coated with a <b>solder</b> <b>mask.</b> The <b>solder</b> <b>mask</b> materials have no affinity to the molten solder and hence, no positive bonding is formed between them as the solder solidifies. This process {{is often referred to as}} Solder Masking. The mask must be centered correctly. The mask protects the PWB against oxidation, and prevents unintended solder bridges from forming between closely spaced solder pads.|$|E

5000|$|Bead probes {{are made}} from a very small [...] "beads" [...] of solder that fit atop of the PCB traces. They are {{manufactured}} using the same techniques as other solder features. Construction requires a hole to be opened in the <b>solder</b> <b>mask,</b> exposing the copper trace. This hole is sized to precisely control the amount of metal that forms the bead. Solder paste {{is applied to the}} location and reflowed. During reflow, solder flows and is drawn to the copper trace. Surface tension causes the bead to have a curved surface and rise above the <b>solder</b> <b>mask,</b> where it solidifies into a Bead Probe. The bead will be roughly obround in shape and may be 15-25 mils long. A properly constructed bead is the same width as the trace and just enough to clear the surrounding <b>solder</b> <b>mask.</b> The bead is then accessible for testing using a probe with a flat end, which can help compensate for the tolerance build up in the test fixture and PCB.|$|E

50|$|Also {{the height}} of the <b>solder</b> <b>mask</b> should be lower than the pad height to avoid {{gasketing}} problems as shown. If {{the height of}} the <b>solder</b> <b>mask</b> is greater than that of the pad, then some of the solder paste would settle in the empty space between the mask and the pad. This is what is referred to as gasketing. It is a seal that fills the space between two surfaces to prevent leakages. However, in this case, the gasketing is a problem as the excess solder paste around the pad may be more than a nuisance factor for circuits having very small line spacing.|$|E
