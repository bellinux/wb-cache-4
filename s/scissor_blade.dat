40|$|A fiber Bragg grating (FBG) -based {{strain sensing}} system for {{minimally}} invasive telerobotic cutting applications {{is presented in}} this paper. Investigations assume that a <b>scissor</b> <b>blade</b> can be approximated as a uniformly tapered cantilever beam. A replica of the <b>scissor</b> <b>blade</b> is produced and strain characterization {{has been carried out}} using an FBG sensor system. Results are validated against measurements obtained using conventional electrical resistance strain gauges. The <b>scissor</b> <b>blade</b> experiences both direct and lateral forces during cutting, hence the system is characterized for a direct load range of 0 - 30 N and a lateral load range of 0 - 10 N. The results show a very good linear response for direct loading and some sensitivity to lateral loading. An actual sensorized <b>scissor</b> <b>blade</b> prototype is also characterized and results compared with that of the replica blade. The FBG interrogation system used was a macro-bend fiber filter-based ratiometric system. The use of FBGs together with macro-bend fiber-based interrogation system eliminates the influence of temperature on the sensing system and hence temperature independent strain information from the blade is obtained. The results obtained using the macro-bend fiber filter are compared with that of a commercial interrogation system and found to be in agreement. By implementing an all fiber sensing system based on fiber Bragg gratings and macrobend fiber filter interrogation system, remote operation of telerobotic cutting applications can be made more cost effective while providing a competitive accuracy and resolution solution. © 2010 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|Thin {{slices of}} soft {{flexible}} solids have negligible bending resistance and hence store negligible elastic strain energy; furthermore such offcuts are rarely permanently deformed after slicing. Cutting forces thus depend only on work of separation (toughness work) and friction. These simplifying assumptions {{are not as}} restrictive as it might seem, and the mechanics are found to apply {{to a wide variety}} of foodstuffs and biological materials. The fracture toughness of such materials may be determined from cutting experiments: the use of scissors instrumented for load and displacement is a popular method where toughness is obtained from the work areas beneath load–displacement plots. Surprisingly, there is no analysis for the variation of forces with <b>scissor</b> <b>blade</b> opening and this paper provides the theory. Comparison is made with experimental results in cutting with scissors. The analysis is generalised to cutting with blades of variable curvature and applied to a commercial food cutting device having a rotating spiral plan form blade. The strong influence of the ‘slice/push ratio’ (blade tangential speed to blade edge normal speed) on the cutting forces is revealed. Small cutting forces are important in food cutting machinery as damage to slices is minimised. How high slice/push ratios may be achieved by choice of blade profile is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Sensorized {{instruments}} that cater for accurate {{measurement of the}} interaction forces (between biological tissue and instrument end-effector) during surgical procedures offer surgeons {{a greater sense of}} immersion during minimally invasive robotic surgery (MIRS). There is much ongoing research into force measurement/evaluation involving surgical graspers. However, comparatively little corresponding effort has been expended in the measurement and subsequent evaluation of forces between scissor blades and tissue. This paper presents the design and development of a force/strain measurement test apparatus, which will ultimately serve as an effective sensor characterisation and evaluation platform. Data acquired from the testing platform can be used to differentiate between tissue samples with differing mechanical properties in a reliable, repeatable manner. PVA cryogel samples which have been exposed to differing freeze-thaw cycles, giving properties similar to those of biological tissue are used. These samples, with a range of stiffness values, allow testbed performance to be evaluated over a wide range of tissue types. Further experimental data/analysis is presented which quantifies the levels of strain generated on the scissor blades during a cutting procedure. The resulting force/strain data correlates well with typical scissor cutting trends. This data is being used to establish a comprehensive set of operational requirements for force sensing transducers which could be incorporated into, or placed on to, a <b>scissor</b> <b>blade</b> end-effector. Future applications of the test equipment will include the assessment of new direct force sensing technologies for telerobotic end-effectors in minimally invasive robotic surgery...|$|E
40|$|The term Multi-Angle and Rear Viewing Endoscopic tooL (MARVEL) denotes an {{auxiliary}} endoscope, now undergoing development, that a surgeon would use {{in conjunction with}} a conventional endoscope to obtain additional perspective. The role of the MARVEL in endoscopic brain surgery would be similar to the role of a mouth mirror in dentistry. Such a tool is potentially useful for in-situ planetary geology applications for the close-up imaging of unexposed rock surfaces in cracks or those not in the direct line of sight. A conventional endoscope provides mostly a frontal view that is, a view along its longitudinal axis and, hence, along a straight line extending from an opening through which it is inserted. The MARVEL could be inserted through the same opening as that of the conventional endoscope, but could be adjusted to provide a view from almost any desired angle. The MARVEL camera image would be displayed, on the same monitor as that of the conventional endoscopic image, as an inset within the conventional endoscopic image. For example, while viewing a tumor from the front in the conventional endoscopic image, the surgeon could simultaneously view the tumor from the side or the rear in the MARVEL image, and could thereby gain additional visual cues that would aid in precise three-dimensional positioning of surgical tools to excise the tumor. Indeed, a side or rear view through the MARVEL could be essential in a case in which the object of surgical interest was not visible from the front. The conceptual design of the MARVEL exploits the surgeon s familiarity with endoscopic surgical tools. The MARVEL would include a miniature electronic camera and miniature radio transmitter mounted on the tip of a surgical tool derived from an endo-scissor (see figure). The inclusion of the radio transmitter would eliminate the need for wires, which could interfere with manipulation of this and other surgical tools. The handgrip of the tool would be connected to a linkage similar to that of an endo-scissor, but the linkage would be configured to enable adjustment of the camera angle instead of actuation of a <b>scissor</b> <b>blade.</b> It is envisioned that thicknesses of the tool shaft and the camera would be less than 4 mm, so that the camera-tipped tool could be swiftly inserted and withdrawn through a dime-size opening. Electronic cameras having dimensions of the order of millimeters are already commercially available, but their designs are not optimized for use in endoscopic brain surgery. The variety of potential endoscopic, thoracoscopic, and laparoscopic applications can be expected to increase as further development of electronic cameras yields further miniaturization and improvements in imaging performance...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} unique and {{scalable}} sensorized medical <b>scissor</b> <b>blades</b> for application in minimally invasive robotic surgery. The blades exploit the strain sensing capabilities {{of a single}} fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor bonded to the blade surface. This smart sensing structure allows detection of friction and material fracture forces during cutting and subsequently enables accurate estimation of the blade kinetic friction coefficient and fracture toughness values of the material being cut. We present theory on the determination of strain variation along the blade length during combined direct and lateral loading of the blade element during operation. Demonstration of the sensorized instrument is realized on an application specific experimental test-bed employing a commercial interrogation system for signal demodulation. Friction and cutting forces measured using the FBG are validated against load cell force data from the test-bed. Characterization tests showed that the sensorized blade has an unfiltered force sensing resolution of 0. 5 N over a 30 N load range. This work demonstrates that a single optical fiber placed onto cutting instrument blades can, in an unobtrusive manner, reliably measure friction forces and material fracture properties during surgical cutting. 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
40|$|A MODIFICATION of Gillies's plastic {{needle holder}} for {{ophthalmic}} use {{was described by}} the author 17 years ago (Foster, 1938).

The instrument had all the great advantages of Gillies's instrument for the forceps tie-knot, though the <b>scissor</b> <b>blades</b> could only be used when cutting sutures in the lids on the temporal side of the eye, owing to limitations of space. With the development of corneo-corneal suturing in cataract extraction, and the corneal grafting made possible by the Bindehautnadel nach Professor Vogt (usually known in England by the Grieshaber catalogue designations 81 / 7 and 8 1 / 10) and the fil de suture corneenne de Marcel Kalt (usually referred to here as Kalt's silk, though it is in fact Sea Island cotton), it became obvious that the jaws were too big to control these tiny round needles and that the serrations on the jaws at times failed to maintain a grip on the fine threads when seized parallel to them. To correct this, the jaws have-how been reduced to a little below the size of the smallest Quarry Silcock needle holder obtainable as a pattern (about half the size of the 1938 model), {{and the rest of the}} instrument has been diminished in proportion.

40|$|Haptic {{feedback}} in telesurgical applications {{refers to}} the relaying of position and force information from a remote surgical site to the surgeon in real-time during a surgical procedure. This feedback, coupled with visual information via microscopic cameras, {{has the potential to}} provide the surgeon with additional ‘feel’ for the manipulations being performed at the instrument-biological tissue interface. This increased sensitivity has many associated benefits which include, but are not limited to; minimal tissue damage, reduced recuperation periods, and less patient trauma. The inclusion of haptic feedback leads to reduction in surgeon fatigue which contributes to enhanced performance during operation. Commercially available Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgical (MIRS) systems are being widely used, the best-known examples being from the daVinci® by Intuitive Surgical Inc. However, currently these systems do not possess force feedback capability which therefore restricts their use during many delicate and complex procedures. The ideal system would consist of a multi-degree-of-freedom framework which includes end-effector instruments with embedded force sensing included. A force sensing characterisation platform has been developed by this group which facilitates the evaluation of force sensing technologies. Surgical scissors have been chosen as the instrument and biological tissue phantom specimens have been used during testing. This test-bed provides accurate, repeatable measurements of the forces produced at the interface between the tissue and the <b>scissor</b> <b>blades</b> during cutting using conventional sensing technologies.

OASI is linked to midline episiotomies and mediolateral episiotomies with post-delivery angles of 60 degrees. Studies show that doctors and midwives are unable to correctly "eyeball" the safe angle required due to perineal stretching by the fetal head at crowning. A new scissor instrument (Episcissors- 60) was devised to allow cutting a mediolateral episiotomy at a fixed angle of 60 degrees from the perineal midline. Methods: Scissors with a marker guide limb pointing towards the anus were devised, ensuring an angle of 60 degrees between the <b>scissor</b> <b>blades</b> and the guide limb. This device was initially tested in models. Post-delivery angles were recorded on transparencies and analyzed by an author blinded to clinical details. Accoucheurs {{were asked to rate}} the ease of use on a 5 -point scale. Results: Of the 17 women, 14 delivered with ventouse, two with forceps, and one with sequential ventouse–forceps. Indications for instrumental delivery were suboptimal cardiotocogram and/or prolonged second stage of labor. Mean birth weight was 3. 41 (2. 92 – 4. 12) kg. A mean post-delivery angle of 42. 4 ± 7 (range 30 – 60, median 43) degrees (95 % confidence interval 38. 8 – 46) was achieved with the Episcissors- 60 instrument. Eighty-eight percent of clinicians agreed or strongly agreed that the scissors were easy to use. Conclusion: The Episcissors- 60 delivered a consistent post-delivery angle of 43 degrees. They could replace "eyeballing" when performing mediolateral episiotomies and form part of a preventative strategy to reduce OASI.

40|$|The 'across grain' {{toughness}} of 51 {{woods has}} been determined on thin wet sections using scissors. The moisture content of sections and the varying sharpness of the <b>scissor</b> <b>blades</b> {{had little effect on}} the results. In thin sections (less than 0. 6 mm), toughness rose linearly with section thickness. The intercept toughness at zero thickness, estimated from regression analysis, was proportional to relative density, consistent with values reported for non-woody plant tissues. Extrapolation of the intercept toughness of these woods and other plant tissues/materials to a relative density of 1. 0 predicted a toughness of 3. 45 kJ m- 2, which we identify with the intrinsic toughness of the cell wall. This quantity appears to predict published results from KIC tests on woods and is related to the propensity for crack deflection. The slope of the relationship between section thickness and toughness, describing the work of plastic buckling of cells, was not proportional to relative density, the lightest (balsa) and heaviest (lignum vitae) woods fracturing with less plastic work than predicted. The size of the plastic zone around the crack tip was estimated to be 0. 5 mm in size. From this, the hypothetical overall toughness of a thick (greater than 1 mm) block of solid cell wall material was calculated as 39. 35 kJ m- 2, due to both cell wall resistance (10 per cent) and the plastic buckling of cells (90 per cent). This value successfully predicts the toughness of most commercial woods (of relative densities between 0. 2 and 0. 8) from 'work area' tests in tension and bending. Though density was the most important factor, both fibre width/fibre length (in hardwoods) and lignin/cellulose ratios were negatively correlated with the work of plastic buckling, after correcting for density. At low densities the work of plastic buckling in the longitudinal radial (LR) direction exceeded that in longitudinal tangential (LT), but the reverse was true for relative densities above 0. 25. This could be attributed to the direction of rays. Density for density, the toughness of temperate hardwoods tested was about 20 per cent lower than that of tropical hardwoods. This is probably due to the much greater number of vessels in temperate hardwoods. Vessels appear either not to display buckling behaviour during fracture at all or to collapse cheaply. These general results have applications to other plant tissues...|$|R
