5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to <b>spread</b> between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free <b>spread</b> and cell-to-cell <b>spread,</b> i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the cell-free <b>spread,</b> virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell <b>spread.</b> The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E
5|$|Viruses <b>spread</b> in many ways. Just as many viruses {{are very}} {{specific}} {{as to which}} host species or tissue they attack, each species of virus relies on a particular method for propagation. Plant viruses are often <b>spread</b> from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as vectors. Some viruses of animals, including humans, are <b>spread</b> by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as influenza are <b>spread</b> through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as norovirus are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. Rotavirus is often <b>spread</b> by direct contact with infected children. The human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex. Others, such as the Dengue virus, are <b>spread</b> by blood-sucking insects.|$|E

40|$|The Osbourn Trough is {{a fossil}} <b>spreading</b> center that rifted apart the Manihiki and Hikurangi Plateaus during Cretaceous time. Previous {{models of the}} Osbourn <b>spreading</b> center are based on data {{collected}} near the trough axis, and therefore only constrain {{the history of the}} Osbourn <b>spreading</b> center during the last few Ma of <b>spreading.</b> Our data set includes multibeam data collected northward to the Manihiki Plateau, allowing us to examine seafloor morphology created during the entire active period of the Osbourn <b>spreading</b> center, as well as several additional multibeam data sets that provide the opportunity {{to examine the relationship between}} the Osbourn paleospreading center and the Cretaceous Pacific-Phoenix ridge. The axial gravity of the trough is similar to the gravity found at other extinct slow-intermediate <b>spreading</b> rate ridges. Magnetic field measurements indicate that <b>spreading</b> at the trough ceased during Chron C 34. Abyssal-hill trends indicate that <b>spreading</b> during the early history of the Osbourn <b>spreading</b> center occurred at 15 °– 20 °. The east-west component of this <b>spreading</b> explains the modern east-west offset of the Manihiki and Hikurangi Plateaus. <b>Spreading</b> rotated to 2 °– 5 ° prior to extinction. Abyssal-hill RMS amplitudes show that a decrease in <b>spreading</b> rate, from > 7 cm/yr to 2 – 6 cm/yr full-spreading rate, occurred ∼ 2 – 6 Ma prior to ridge extinction. Our data analysis is unable to determine the exact <b>spreading</b> rate of the Osbourn <b>spreading</b> center prior to the slowing event. The temporal constraints provided by our data show that the Osbourn <b>spreading</b> center ceased <b>spreading</b> prior to 87 Ma or 93 Ma, depending on whether the Manihiki and Hikurangi Plateaus rifted at 115 Ma or 121 Ma. Our model resolves the conflict between regional models of Osbourn <b>spreading</b> with models based on trough characteristics by showing that <b>spreading</b> at the Osbourn <b>spreading</b> center was decoupled from Pacific-Phoenix <b>spreading...</b>|$|R

50|$|Seafloor <b>spreading</b> is {{a process}} that occurs at mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed through {{volcanic}} activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge. Seafloor <b>spreading</b> helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere.The motivating force for seafloor <b>spreading</b> ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at <b>spreading</b> ridges. At a <b>spreading</b> center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at <b>spreading</b> centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the <b>spreading</b> zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the <b>spreading</b> zone. Additionally <b>spreading</b> rates determine if the ridge is a fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges see <b>spreading</b> rate of more than 9 cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a <b>spreading</b> rate of 4-9 cm/year while slow <b>spreading</b> ridges have a rate less than 4 cm/year.|$|R

5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to <b>spread</b> between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free <b>spread</b> and cell-to-cell <b>spread,</b> i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the cell-free <b>spread,</b> virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell <b>spread.</b> Two pathways of cell-to-cell transmission have been reported. Firstly, an infected T cell can transmit virus directly to a target T cell via a virological synapse. Secondly, an antigen presenting cell (APC) can also transmit HIV to T cells by a process that either involves productive infection (in the case of macrophages) or capture and transfer of virions in trans (in the case of dendritic cells). Whichever pathway is used, infection by cell-to-cell transfer {{is reported to be}} much more efficient than cell-free virus <b>spread.</b> A number of factors contribute to this increased efficiency, including polarised virus budding towards the site of cell-to-cell contact, close apposition of cells which minimizes fluid-phase diffusion of virions, and clustering of HIV entry receptors on the target cell to the contact zone. Cell-to-cell <b>spread</b> is thought to be particularly important in lymphoid tissues where CD4+ T lymphocytes are densely packed and likely to frequently interact. Intravital imaging studies have supported the concept of the HIV virological synapse in vivo. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E

40|$|With great {{theoretical}} and practical significance, identifying the node <b>spreading</b> influence of complex network {{is one of the}} most promising domains. So far, various topology-based centrality measures have been proposed to identify the node <b>spreading</b> influence in a network. However, the node <b>spreading</b> influence is a result of the interplay between the network topology structure and <b>spreading</b> dynamics. In this paper, we build up the systematic method by combining the network structure and <b>spreading</b> dynamics to identify the node <b>spreading</b> influence. By combining the adjacent matrix A and <b>spreading</b> parameter β, we theoretical give the node <b>spreading</b> influence with the eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue. Comparing with the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model epidemic results for four real networks, our method could identify the node <b>spreading</b> influence more accurately than the ones generated by the degree, K-shell and eigenvector centrality. This work may provide a systematic method for identifying node <b>spreading</b> influence. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
