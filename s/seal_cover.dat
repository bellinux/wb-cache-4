50|$|Throughout {{much of the}} West of the North Island, rocks {{containing}} coal {{were formed}} from swampland in Late Eocene times (37-34 Ma). The land sunk and the sea transgressed, and calcareous sandstone, mudstone, and limestone were deposited in Oligocene times (34-24 Ma). These rocks underlie more recent Miocene rocks, around the Taranaki Peninsula and surrounding seas. The Eocene rocks often provide oil and gas deposits of the Taranaki Region. Mudstone anticlines often provide a suitable <b>sealing</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{gas mask}} is worn over {{the face to}} protect the wearer from inhaling [...] "airborne pollutants" [...] and toxic gases.

Some gas masks are also respirators, though the word gas mask {{is often used to}} refer to military equipment (e.g. field protective mask). The user of the gas mask is not protected from gas that the skin can absorb. Most gas mask filters will last around 24 hours in a nuclear biological chemical (NBC) situation.|$|R

[...] "Quick beats of the pectoral fins" [...] allow hatchetfish to [...] "lift themselves half {{out of the water}} and glide along the surface ... Some species can even leave the water for short stretches" [...] Because of this ability to fly and tendency to jump, aquaria used to keep hatchetfish should have a tightly <b>sealed</b> <b>cover</b> to prevent these fish from escaping.|$|R

5000|$|The Trangia stove is {{a popular}} {{commercial}} alcohol stove, which is available in many different models, from a single bare burner to an integrated expedition cooking system. Some of these come with a <b>sealing</b> <b>cover,</b> allowing the burner to be packed while still containing fuel, although putting the lid on while the stove is hot can damage the O ring seal (hence it may leak in transit). An even simpler system is the Sterno heater, in which the can that contains a jellied fuel also serves as the burner. Homemade beverage can stoves (or [...] "Pepsi can stoves") are similar. These are made from discarded aluminium beverage cans, and come {{in a wide variety}} of different designs.|$|R

40|$|In this study, a {{laser line}} auto-scanning system was {{designed}} to perform underwater close-range 3 D reconstructions with high accuracy and resolution. The system changes the laser plane direction with a galvanometer to perform automatic scanning and obtain continuous laser strips for underwater 3 D reconstruction. The system parameters were calibrated with the homography constraints between the target plane and image plane. A cost function was defined to optimize the galvanometer’s rotating axis equation. Compensation was carried out for the refraction of the incident and emitted light at the interface. The accuracy and the spatial measurement capability of the system were tested and analyzed with standard balls under laboratory underwater conditions, and the 3 D surface reconstruction for a <b>sealing</b> <b>cover</b> of an underwater instrument was proved to be satisfactory...|$|R
50|$|The diploma {{consisted}} of two bronze tablets hinged together. Inscriptions would be engraved {{on each side of}} both plates. The full text of a diploma was engraved on the outer side of the so-called tabula 1, while the outer side of tabula 2 displayed the names of 7 witnesses, their <b>seals</b> <b>covered</b> and protected by metal strips (such seals have rarely survived, being of organic material). The text of tabula 1 was reproduced exactly on the two inner sides. The plates would then be folded shut and sealed together, so that the external inscription would be legible without breaking the seals. The internal inscription was the official notarised copy of the text on the constitutio published in Rome. The double-inscription and seals were presumably to prevent forgery or alteration.|$|R

2500|$|A {{gas mask}} is a mask worn over {{the face to}} protect the wearer from inhaling [...] "airborne pollutants" [...] and toxic gasses. The mask forms a <b>sealed</b> <b>cover</b> over the nose and mouth, but may also cover the eyes and other {{vulnerable}} soft tissues of the face. The gas mask was invented in 1847 by Lewis Haslett, a device that contained elements that allowed breathing through a nose and mouthpiece, inhalation of air through a bulb-shaped filter, and a vent to exhale air back into the atmosphere. According to First Facts, it states that the [...] "gas mask resembling the modern type was patented by Lewis Phectic Haslett of Louisville, Kentucky who received a patent on June 12, 1849". U.S. patent #6,529 issued to Haslett, described the first [...] "Inhaler or Lung Protector" [...] that filtered dust from the air.|$|R
