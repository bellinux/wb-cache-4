5|$|The {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the {{receiving}} chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The atria open into the ventricles via the atrioventricular valves, {{present in the}} atrioventricular septum. This distinction is visible also {{on the surface of}} the heart as the coronary <b>sulcus.</b> There is an ear-shaped structure in the upper right atrium called the right atrial appendage, or auricle, and another in the upper left atrium, the left atrial appendage. The right atrium and the right ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the right heart. Similarly, the left atrium and the left ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the left heart. The ventricles are separated from each other by the interventricular septum, visible {{on the surface of the}} heart as the anterior longitudinal <b>sulcus</b> and the posterior interventricular <b>sulcus.</b>|$|E

5|$|The ilium of {{the pelvis}} had a convex upper border, a low postacetabular blade (behind the acetabulum), and a narrow brevis-shelf (a {{projection}} where tail muscles attached). The pubic foot was pronounced and shorter {{at the front}} than behind. The ischium was straight and expanded hindwards, ending in a lobe-shape. The femur was sigmoid-shaped, and had a very robust, upwards pointing head, with a deep <b>sulcus</b> (groove). The lesser trochanter of the femoral head was wing-like, and placed below the greater trochanter, which was short. The fourth trochanter was large and projected backwards. The tibia of the lower leg was expanded at the upper end, its articular facet (where it articulated with the femur) was wide, and its shaft was compressed from front to back.|$|E

Our previous work proceeds with segmentation of the brain by thresholding the LCR, and skeletonisation of the LCR. We present here a method based on geometrical feature (curvature) which doesn't require the fine segmentation of the LCR-Grey Matter or of the Grey Matter-White Matter interface.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the influence of gyri and <b>sulci</b> on the response of human head under transient loading. To this end, two detailed parasagittal slice models with and without gyri and <b>sulci</b> have been developed. The models comprised not only cerebrum and skull but also cerebellum, brain stem, CSF, and corpus callosum. In addition, white and gray matters were separated. The material properties were adopted from the literature and assigned to different parts of the models. Nahum’s and Trosseille’s experiments reported in relevant literature were simulated and the simulation results were compared with the test data. The results show that there is no evident difference in terms of intracranial pressure between the models with and without gyri and <b>sulci</b> under simulated conditions. The equivalent stress below gyri and <b>sulci</b> in the model with gyri and <b>sulci</b> is slightly higher than that in the counterpart model without gyri and <b>sulci.</b> The maximum principle strain in brain tissue is lower in the model with gyri and <b>sulci.</b> The stress and strain distributions are changed due to the existence of gyri and <b>sulci.</b> These findings highlight the necessity to include gyri and <b>sulci</b> in the finite element head modeling...|$|R

25|$|In {{the fourth}} week a {{swelling}} appears {{from the second}} pharyngeal arch, in the midline, called the copula. During the fifth and sixth weeks the copula is overgrown by a swelling from {{the third and fourth}} arches (mainly from the third arch) called the hypopharyngeal eminence, and this develops into the posterior part of the tongue (the other third). The hypopharyngeal eminence develops mainly by the growth of endoderm from the third pharyngeal arch. The boundary between the two parts of the tongue, the anterior from the first arch and the posterior from the third arch is marked by the terminal <b>sulcus.</b> The terminal <b>sulcus</b> is shaped like a V with the tip of the V situated posteriorly.

25|$|The {{terminal}} <b>sulcus</b> is {{a shallow}} groove that runs forward as a shallow groove in a V shape from the foramen cecum, forwards and outwards to the margins (borders) of the tongue. The terminal <b>sulcus</b> divides the tongue into a posterior pharyngeal part and an anterior oral part. The pharyngeal part is {{supplied by the}} glossopharyngeal nerve and the oral part is suppled by the lingual nerve (a branch of the mandibular branch (V3) of the trigeminal nerve) for somatosensory perception and by the chorda tympani (a branch of the facial nerve) for taste perception.|$|E
25|$|The {{tongue is}} a muscular hydrostat that forms {{part of the}} floor of the oral cavity.

The apex of the terminal <b>sulcus</b> is marked by a blind foramen, the foramen cecum, which is the remnant of median thyroid diverticulum in early embryonic development. The anterior oral part is the visible part situated at the front and makes up roughly two-thirds the length of the tongue. The posterior pharyngeal part is the part closest to the throat, roughly one-third of its length. These parts differ in terms of their embryological development and nerve supply.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMany studies {{dealing with}} the human brain use the spatial {{coordinate}} system of brain anatomy to localize functional regions. Unfortunately, brain anatomy, and especially cortical <b>sulci,</b> {{is characterized by a}} high interindividual variability. Specific tools called anatomical atlases must then be considered to make the interpretation of anatomical examinations easier. The work described here first aims at building a numerical atlas of the main cortical <b>sulci.</b> Our system is based on a database containing a collection of anatomical MRI of healthy volunteer brains. Their <b>sulci</b> have been manually drawn and labeled for both hemispheres. <b>Sulci</b> are represented as 3 D superficial curves. After a nonlinear registration process, a statistical atlas of the cortical topography of a particular MRI is built from the database. It is an a priori model of cortical <b>sulci,</b> including three major components: an average curve represents the average shape and position of each sulcus; a search area accounts for its spatial variation domain; a set of quantitative parameters describes the variability of <b>sulci</b> geometry and topology. This atlas is completely individualized and adapted to the features of the brain under examination. The atlas is represented by a graph, the nodes of which represent <b>sulci</b> and the edges the relations between <b>sulci.</b> It can also be considered a statistical model that describes the cortical topography as well as its variability...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at {{studying}} {{the effect of}} <b>sulci</b> structures during tumor growth and cerebral edema in brain tissues.

To consider the extra-large deformation during the tumor growth, a nonlinear finite element method has been adopted. Numerical simulation results reveal that <b>sulci</b> structures play significant roles in macroscopic volume expansion and maximum stress of brain tissues. Without considering the <b>sulci</b> structures, predictions on the ICP will be dramatically different from those including <b>sulci</b> structure.
