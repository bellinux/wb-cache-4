40|$|The use of sunscreens as {{protective}} barriers against {{skin damage}} and cancer, by absorbing harmful UVA and UVB rays, {{is becoming an}} increasingly important issue. Such products are usually based on TiO 2 or ZnO, although both Fe 2 O 3 and hydroxyapatite (Ca- 10 (PO 4) (6) (OH) (2), HAp) doped with metal ions have been reported as being ultraviolet (UV) absorbing materials. HAp is {{the main component of}} bone; it is, therefore, highly biocompatible. In the present work, an iron-doped HAp-based material, containing both Fe ions substituted into the HAp structure and iron oxide in hematite (alpha-Fe 2 O 3) form, was successfully developed from waste cod fish bones. This was achieved through a simple process of treating the bones in a Fe(II) containing solution, followed by heating at 700 degrees C. The material showed good absorption in the whole UV range and did not form radicals when irradiated.

Methods: SAF was measured before and after local administration of body lotion, day <b>cream,</b> <b>sunscreen,</b> or self-browning <b>cream</b> and after attempts to remove these effects with alcohol swabs and washing. SAF was measured before and during three hyperemia maneuvers: vasoconstriction and on a dry and wet skin. Results: The body lotion increased SAF by 18 %. Day <b>cream,</b> <b>sunscreen,</b> and self-browning <b>cream</b> gave an increase of > 100 %. Except for body lotion, subsequent cleaning with alcohol swabs and washing with soap did not return SAF to baseline values.

40|$|BACKGROUND. There is an 'epidemic' {{increase}} in skin cancers worldwide in white-skinned populations. Australia {{has the highest}} incidence of skin {{cancer in the world}} despite intensive publicity in the last 30 years aimed at prevention. AIM. This study set out to assess risk factors, knowledge and preventive behaviour relevant to skin cancer in general practice patients in South Australia, and to investigate the relationship between risk, knowledge and behaviour. METHOD. A questionnaire on skin cancer was distributed to 980 patients aged 16 years and over attending general practitioners' surgeries in South Australia. A total of 810 questionnaires were analysed (83 %). RESULTS. There was a high overall level of knowledge and awareness of skin cancer. However, the majority of respondents were unaware of the risks of blue eyes (87 %), fair hair (83 %) or red hair (68 %). A third of respondents were unaware that having lots of moles and freckles was a risk factor for skin cancer. A considerable minority were unaware of the risk of a fair complexion (26 %), getting sunburnt (14 %) or prolonged exposure to the sun (11 %). <b>Sunscreen</b> <b>cream</b> was the most popular preventive behaviour (use reported by 74 %), followed by clothing (54 %), shade (16 %) and timed sun exposure (13 %). The most common number of methods of prevention used was two, but 16 % were not able to mention anything that they did to prevent skin cancer. The correlations between presence of risk factors, knowledge and preventive behaviour were poor. CONCLUSION. There was a high overall level of knowledge and awareness of skin cancer in South Australia but despite intense publicity, important areas of ignorance were still found to exist. The simpler methods of skin cancer prevention appeared to be neglected in favour of <b>sunscreen</b> <b>cream.</b> Those at high risk did not know more about skin cancer and reported doing little more to prevent it than those at low risk.

40|$|Background: TiO 2 {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) {{which are}} used in sunscreen formulations are able to block ultraviolet (UV) radiation with a higher efficiency compared with micro-scale particles. The concentration of corresponding particles {{is an important factor}} in UV attenuation effects as well as cell toxicity profiles. Herein, TiO 2 NPs were dispersed using ultrasonication treatment and a <b>sunscreen</b> <b>cream</b> was prepared using TiO 2 NPs. Methods: The effect of TiO 2 concentration (i. e. a physical barrier) and octocrylene (i. e. a chemical UV filter) as well as sonication time (i. e. aggregation preventer) were studied on UVB blocking efficiency of the preparation by measurement of sun protection factor (SPF). Response surface methodology was employed to investigate the effect of the inputs (independent parameters) on the output (dependent parameter). Results: Findings indicated that maximum amount of nano-TiO 2 and octocrylene make the preparation most effective. The effect of ultrasonication in breaking the agglomerates was however dominated by the effect of concentration of octocrylene, possibly due to hydrophobic interactions between NPs and octocrylene. Also, TiO 2 NPs showed a significant increase in cytotoxicity profile of the preparation.

40|$|Background: Wrong {{beliefs about}} risky actions such as sunbathing and tanning are common due to media {{advertisements}} or {{general lack of}} knowledge. This work {{has focused on the}} knowledge and attitude of a group of citizens in Tehran, Iran and the protective actions they take regarding undesirable effects of the sun. Methods: A descriptive-analytic cross-sectional study has been conducted on 400 randomly selected individuals from the citi-zens of Shahrak-E-Gharb, an area in northwest Tehran. A questionnaire comprising 24 questions including demographic informa-tion, individuals ’ knowledge about sun exposure, and their opinions and behaviors on protective actions towards solar radiation were used to assess study objectives. Crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95 % condence intervals for socio-demographic fac-tors were calculated through univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Results: The majority of participants had good knowledge about sun protective behaviors. Knowledge about sun exposure dura-tion and tanning was higher among women and those with higher education. As for attitude, only 15 % were concerned about skin cancer and 61. 8 % thought skin cancer can be prevented by sun protection. Higher education was associated with a more positive attitude towards tanning. Among respondents, 41 % had suitable clothing to protect themselves against sun burn and only 32 % used sunscreen most of the time. University graduates had signicantly better practice towards using <b>sunscreen</b> <b>cream</b> compared to high school graduates. Conclusion: Although our study sample possessed good knowledge towards sun protection, their attitude and practices were unsatisfactory. Thereby, they need to be informed and educated as how to be safely protected against excessive sun exposure...|$|E
40|$|Public health campaigns {{encourage}} people to protect themselves against skin cancer by using sunscreens and taking other protective measures. The objective is to estimate {{the impact of these}} campaigns on the rise of awareness among the general public. This study explores the prevalence and predictors of solar protection behaviour in a sample of beachgoers and compares these results to another similar study carried out 9 years earlier (i. e. summer 2001). During the month of August 2010, a total of 408 participants (144 men and 264 women) were randomly selected {{on their way to the}} Belgian beach in the city of Ostend, Belgium. The solar protection behaviour of each participant was assessed by direct observation and an interview. The exact same questions were asked as in 2001. The general risk awareness stays the same for skin aging and skin cancer but gets higher for sunburn. When we control these results for sex, the overall higher general awareness is completely because of the higher awareness of the female subgroup. As in 2001, risk awareness is considerably higher in the female subgroup than in the male one. As in 2001, <b>sunscreen</b> <b>cream</b> was the most popular preventive behaviour in 2010 (use of sunscreen with sun protection factor 15 or higher reported by 66. 4 %), followed by timed sun exposure (46. 8 %), use of clothing and hats (36. 8 %) and shade (34. 1 %). As in summer 2001 the sunscreen use is more popular in the female population. The use of protective clothing and hats is more popular in the male group. As solar protection has become part of the beach behaviour routine, there is room for improvement for their more frequent application, the use of a higher sun protection factor (15 +), timed sunbathing, more use of clothing and hats and seeking shade. The results of this study can assist in evaluating the effectiveness of present sun-protection campaigns and health education programmes.

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics as products intended to cleanse or beautify (for instance, shampoos and lipstick). A separate category exists for medications, which are intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease, or to affect the structure or function of the body (for instance, <b>sunscreens</b> and acne <b>creams).</b> Some products, such as moisturizing sunscreens and anti-dandruff shampoos, are regulated within both categories.
