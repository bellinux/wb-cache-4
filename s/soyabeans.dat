40|$|Infectious {{diarrhoea}} is a {{major problem}} in both children and piglets. Infection of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) results in fluid secretion and electrolyte losses in the small intestine. In the present study the effect of processed and fermented <b>soyabean</b> products on net absorption during ETEC infection was investigated. <b>Soyabean</b> was processed into an autoclaved, a cooked and a mould-fermented (tempeh) product. The <b>soyabean</b> products were pre-digested and the effect of the products on net absorption in the small intestine of piglets was studied. Pairs of small-intestinal segments, one non-infected and the other ETEC-infected, were perfused simultaneously with the different products during 8 h. Net absorption of fluid, DM, Na, chloride, K and total solutes was determined. Net fluid absorption was highest for cooked <b>soyabean</b> followed by autoclaved <b>soyabean</b> and tempeh {{as a result of the}} osmolality of these products. In ETEC-infected segments, cooked <b>soyabean</b> and tempeh showed minor fluid losses (27 (se 23) and 43 (se 20) ¿l/cm 2, respectively) compared with the saline control (260 (se 23) ¿l/cm 2).

The present study aimed to determine the effect of an increasing dose of dietary vegetable oil on allergic outcomes in mice. To study this, mice received a 7 v. 10 % <b>soyabean</b> oil diet before and during oral sensitisation with whey or whey hyperimmune serum transfer. Another group of mice received partial whey hydrolysate (pWH) while being fed the diets before oral sensitisation. The acute allergic skin response, serum Ig level, mouse mast cell protease- 1 (mMCP- 1) concentration and/or splenic T-cell percentages were determined upon whey challenge. When the diets were provided before and during oral sensitisation, the acute allergic skin response was increased in mice fed the 10 % <b>soyabean</b> oil diet compared with the 7 % <b>soyabean</b> oil diet. Whey IgE and IgG 1 levels remained unaltered, whereas mMCP- 1 levels increased in mice fed the 10 % <b>soyabean</b> oil diet. Furthermore, allergic symptoms were increased in naive mice fed the 10 % <b>soyabean</b> oil diet and sensitised with whey hyperimmune serum. In addition to enhancing the mast cell response, the 10 % <b>soyabean</b> oil diet increased the percentage of activated Th 1 and Th 2 cells as well as increased the ratios of Th 2 :regulatory T cells and Th 2 :Th 1 when compared with the 7 % <b>soyabean</b> oil diet. Oral tolerance induction by pWH was abrogated in mice fed the 10 % <b>soyabean</b> oil diet compared with those fed the 7 % <b>soyabean</b> oil diet during pretreatment with pWH. In conclusion, increased intake of <b>soyabean</b> oil rich in n- 6 PUFA suppresses tolerance induction by pWH and enhances the severity of the allergic effector response in whey-allergic mice.

Also, the Hmars enjoy sathu (a kind of fermented fats mostly of pork) and prepared in various dishes. The preparation for fermentation is that fat of pork is cut into pieces and cooked well. It is then put into an airtight container (preferably a traditional gourd) for some days until it is fermented. Sathu forms {{one of the main}} traditional seasoning agents for curries. Some other seasoning items like [...] "sithu" [...] (made from fermented sesame seeds), [...] "bekanthu" [...] (made from fermented <b>soyabeans),</b> etc. are also commonly eaten.The diet of the Hmar people is very simple.

One of the major factors limiting this potential is farmers preference to allocate nutrient resources to food security cereal crops on the most fertile fields, leaving grain legumes to grow on residual fertility on infertile fields. Two experiments were conducted to: (i) compare the current farmer practice with targeting manure and single super phosphate (SSP) to <b>soyabean</b> in a three-year rotation cycle on two fields with different soil fertility: an infertile sandy soil and a more fertile clay soil; and (ii) assess the effects of variability of soil fertility within and across farms on productivity of <b>soyabean</b> and groundnut. In the first experiment, <b>soyabean</b> (< 0. 2 t ha? 1) and maize yields (< 0. 7 t ha? 1) without fertilizer were poor on a degraded sandy soil. Both crops responded poorly to SSP due to deficiency of other nutrients. Manure application significantly increased <b>soyabean</b> and maize yields, led to yield stabilization over three seasons and also significantly increased the proportion of N 2 fixed by <b>soyabean</b> (measured using 15 N natural abundance) from 60 % to 83 %. On the sandy soil, P was used more efficiently and gross margins were greater when SSP and manure were applied to maize in a maize <b>soyabean</b> rotation. <b>Soyabean</b> and maize yields without fertilizer inputs were larger on clay soil with moderate fertility (0. 4 0. 7 t ha? 1 and 2. 0 2. 3 t ha? 1 respectively) and were significantly increased by application of SSP and manure. Within rotations, P recovery was higher when manure and SSP were applied to maize (43 and 25 %) than when applied to <b>soyabean</b> (20 and 19 %). However, application of manure to <b>soyabean</b> on the clay was more profitable than application to maize for individual crops and within rotations. In the second experiment, <b>soyabean</b> and groundnut yields were largest (? 1 and ? 0. 8 t ha? 1 respectively) on plots closest to homesteads on wealthy farms, which were more fertile due to good past management. Yields were poor (< 0. 5 t ha? 1) on other fields which previously had received little nutrient inputs. <b>Soyabean</b> and groundnut yields correlated well with available P (R 2 = 0. 5 0. 7) and soil organic C (SOC) contents (R 2 = 0. 4 0. 6). For smallholder farmers to maximise benefits from legume production they need {{to focus attention on}} the more fertile plots, although production should be optimized in relation to maize. Targeting nutrients to maize as currently practiced by farmers was more efficient and economic under poor soil fertility conditions, whilst potential exists to increase income by targeting manure to <b>soyabean</b> on the more fertile soils.

40|$|Nutritional {{recovery}} with a <b>soyabean</b> diet decreases {{body and}} fat weights {{when compared with}} a casein diet. We investigated whether the reduced adiposity observed in rats recovering from early-life malnutrition with a <b>soyabean</b> diet results from alterations in lipid metabolism in white adipose tissue (WAT) and/or brown adipose tissue (BAT). Male rats from mothers fed either 17 or 6 % protein during pregnancy and lactation were maintained on 17 % casein (CC and LC groups), 17 % <b>soyabean</b> (CS and LS groups) or 6 % casein (LL group) diets over 60 d. The rats maintained on a <b>soyabean</b> diet had similar relative food intakes, but lower body and retroperitoneal WAT weights and a reduced lipid content in the retroperitoneal WAT. The insulin levels were lower in the recovered rats and were elevated in those fed a <b>soyabean</b> diet. Serum T 3 concentration and uncoupling protein 1 content in the BAT were decreased in the recovered rats. The thermogenic capacity of the BAT was not affected by the <b>soyabean</b> diet. The lipogenesis rate in the retroperitoneal WAT was similar {{in all of the}} groups except for the LL group, which had exacerbated lipogenesis. The enhancement of the lipolysis rate by isoproterenol was decreased in white adipocytes from the soyabean-recovered rats and was elevated in adipocytes from the soyabean-control rats. Thus, in animals maintained on a <b>soyabean</b> diet, the proportions of fat deposits are determined by the lipolysis rate, which differs depending on the previous nutritional status...|$|R
