Originally the switch locked the screen to its current orientation, but the iOS 4.2 changed it to a mute switch, with rotation lock now available in an onscreen menu. In the iOS 4.3 update, released with the iPad 2, a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute.|$|E
5|$|The first-generation iPad {{features}} an Apple A4 SoC, which comprises a 1GHz processor, 256MB of RAM and a PowerVR SGX535 GPU. There are four physical <b>switches</b> <b>on</b> the iPad, including a home button near the display that returns {{the user to}} the main menu, and three plastic physical <b>switches</b> <b>on</b> the sides: wake/sleep and volume up/down, plus a software-controlled switch whose function has changed with software updates.

In the iOS 4.3 update, a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute. Unlike its successors, the first-generation iPad has no cameras.|$|E
5|$|Player {{controls}} include clockwise and counterclockwise rotation, forward thrust, firing torpedoes, and hyperspace. Initially {{these were}} controlled using the front-panel test <b>switches</b> <b>on</b> the PDP-1 minicomputer, with four switches for each player, but these {{proved to be}} awkward to use and wore out quickly under normal gameplay, as well as causing players to accidentally flip the computer's control and power switches. The location of the switches also left one player {{off to one side}} of the CRT display due to the limited space in front of the computer, which left them at a disadvantage. To alleviate these problems, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. The gamepad had a switch for turning left or right, another for forward thrust or hyperspace, and a torpedo launch button. The button was silent so that the opposing player would not have a warning that the player was attempting to fire a torpedo during a cooldown period.|$|E

The album's name is in tribute to Switched-On Bach and other similar titles from the late 1960s to 1970s that feature Moog synthesizers as the primary instrument. [...] <b>Switched</b> <b>On</b> was later licensed to Slumberland Records for a US release, and Rough Trade Germany, for that country, both in 1992.|$|R

5|$|Such a {{cascading}} regulatory {{network has}} been studied in detail {{in the development of}} the fruit fly embryo. The young embryo is oval in shape, like a rugby ball. A small number of genes produce messenger RNAs that set up concentration gradients along the long axis of the embryo. In the early embryo, the bicoid and hunchback genes are at high concentration near the anterior end, and give pattern to the future head and thorax; the caudal and nanos genes are at high concentration near the posterior end, and give pattern to the hindmost abdominal segments. The effects of these genes interact; for instance, the Bicoid protein blocks the translation of caudals messenger RNA, so the Caudal protein concentration becomes low at the anterior end. Caudal later <b>switches</b> <b>on</b> genes which create the fly's hindmost segments, but only at the posterior end where it is most concentrated.|$|E
5|$|The IND {{side of the}} station, the {{southern}} side, was completed in 1984, when it was named the Construction Achievement Project of the Year by the Metropolitan Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers; however, it did not open for passenger service until October 29, 1989, due to delays {{in the construction of}} the multi-level 63rd Street Tunnel, caused by the financial crisis of the 1970s. Upon the station's opening, it operated as a typical one-track, one-side platform station on each level, with only the IND side in use, while the BMT side of each level was hidden beyond an orange tiled false wall. <b>Switches</b> <b>on</b> both levels connected the lines to the west of the station.|$|E
5|$|The game offers three {{different}} skill levels. Level 1 is the easiest, as {{it uses a}} simplified room layout missing one of the castles {{and one of the}} mazes, and doesn't include the bat and one of the dragons. Level 2 is the full version of the game, with the various objects appearing in set positions {{at the start of the}} game. Level 3 is similar to Level 2, but the location of the objects is randomized to provide a more challenging game. In addition, the player can use the difficulty <b>switches</b> <b>on</b> the Atari 2600 to further control the game's difficulty by affecting the behavior of the dragons: one switch controls the dragons' bite speed, and one causes them to flee when the player is wielding the sword.|$|E

25|$|In 1824, the French {{physicist}} François Arago formulated {{the existence}} of rotating magnetic fields, termed Arago's rotations, which, by manually turning <b>switches</b> <b>on</b> and off, Walter Baily demonstrated in 1879 as in effect the first primitive induction motor.|$|E
25|$|When Ras is 'switched on' by {{incoming}} signals, it subsequently <b>switches</b> <b>on</b> other proteins, {{which ultimately}} turn on genes involved in cell growth, differentiation and survival. Mutations in ras genes {{can lead to}} the production of permanently activated Ras proteins. As a result, this can cause unintended and overactive signaling inside the cell, {{even in the absence of}} incoming signals.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to bipolar transistors, MOSFETs {{do not require}} constant power input, {{as long as they}} are not being <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> or off. The isolated gate-electrode of the MOSFET forms a capacitor (gate capacitor), which must be charged or discharged each time the MOSFET is <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> or off. As a transistor requires a particular gate voltage in order to <b>switch</b> <b>on,</b> the gate capacitor must be charged to at least the required gate voltage for the transistor to be <b>switched</b> <b>on.</b> Similarly, to <b>switch</b> the transistor off, this charge must be dissipated, i.e. the gate capacitor must be discharged.|$|R
40|$|In {{a series}} of {{experiments}} the peak current during <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> of a fast switching valve, which {{was found to be}} out of tolerances with respect to some armature dimensions, was varied to realize different <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> times. Despite the fact that the holding current was identical for all cases and the time between <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> and off was very long, the valve’s switch off time showed an unexpected dependency <b>on</b> the <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> peak current value. This paper presents an explanation of this phenomenon by coarse mathematical models, demonstrating that the manufacturing error in combination with friction, skewness, and fluid stiction are responsible for this behavior...|$|R

25|$|When {{the machine}} first shipped, {{flipping}} <b>switches</b> <b>on</b> the front panel {{was the only}} way to get programs or data into the machine, and the only output from the programs was the patterns of lights on the panel.

Roberts was already hard at work on additional cards, including a paper tape reader for storage, additional RAM cards, and a RS-232 interface to connect to a proper Teletype terminal.|$|E
25|$|A 1982 Presidential Emergency Board convened {{under the}} Railway Labor Act {{directed}} United States railroads to begin eliminating caboose cars where {{possible to do}} so. A legal exception was the state of Virginia, which had a 1911 law mandating cabooses {{on the ends of}} trains, until the law's final repeal in 1988. With this exception aside, year by year, cabooses started to fade away. Very few cabooses remain in operation today, though they are still used for some local trains where it is convenient to have a brakeman {{at the end of the}} train to operate <b>switches,</b> <b>on</b> long reverse movements, and are also used on trains carrying hazardous materials.|$|E
50|$|When {{the circuit}} is first powered up, neither {{transistor}} will be <b>switched</b> <b>on.</b> However, {{this means that}} at this stage they will both have high base voltages and therefore a tendency to <b>switch</b> <b>on,</b> and inevitable slight asymmetries will mean {{that one of the}} transistors is first to <b>switch</b> <b>on.</b> This will quickly put the circuit into one of the above states, and oscillation will ensue. In practice, oscillation always occurs for practical values of R and C.|$|R

25|$|Relay logic was {{introduced}} with factory electrification, which underwent rapid adaption from 1900 though the 1920s. Central electric power stations were also undergoing rapid growth {{and operation of}} new high pressure boilers, steam turbines and electrical substations created a large demand for instruments and controls. Central control rooms became common in the 1920s, but {{as late as the}} early 1930s, most process control was on-off. Operators typically monitored charts drawn by recorders that plotted data from instruments. To make corrections, operators manually opened or closed valves or turned <b>switches</b> <b>on</b> or off. Control rooms also used color coded lights to send signals to workers in the plant to manually make certain changes.|$|E
25|$|The driverless tractor is {{considered}} controversial {{in terms of}} safety and public acceptance. A tractor operating without a driver makes some people nervous. Creating technology that stays safe in all scenarios where failure could possibly occur {{takes a lot of}} programming and time. In terms of motion detection, the tractors have sensors to stop them if they detect objects in their path such as people, animals, vehicles or other large objects. In 2004, researchers from the Danish Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University published a paper in which they examined the safety of a driverless tractor in detail. With their driverless tractor, they had one person designated as a safety operator. This operator controlled a switch which could immediately shut down and halt the tractor. They also wired four emergency stop <b>switches</b> <b>on</b> each corner of the tractor.|$|E

The display responds to other sensors: an ambient light sensor to adjust screen brightness and a 3-axis accelerometer to sense orientation and to switch between portrait and landscape modes. Unlike the iPhone and iPod Touch's built-in applications, which work in three orientations (portrait, landscape-left and landscape-right), the iPad's built-in applications support screen rotation in all four orientations, including upside-down. Consequently, the device has no intrinsic [...] "native" [...] orientation; only the relative position of the home button changes.|$|E

Misako enters the arena and, crazed, he instinctively shoots her dead, then falls from the ring.|$|E
500|$|The game {{features}} two spaceships, [...] "the needle" [...] and [...] "the wedge", {{engaged in}} a dogfight while maneuvering in the gravity well of a star. Both ships are controlled by human players. Each ship has limited fuel for maneuvering and {{a limited number of}} torpedoes, and the ships follow Newtonian physics, remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating. Flying near the star to provide a gravity assist was a common tactic. Ships are destroyed when hit by a torpedo or colliding with the star. At any time, the player can engage a hyperspace feature to move to a new, random location on the screen, though each use has an increasing chance of destroying the ship instead. The game was initially controlled with <b>switches</b> <b>on</b> the PDP-1, though Alan Kotok and Bob Saunders built an early gamepad to reduce the difficulty and awkwardness of controlling the game.|$|E
500|$|The series {{revolves}} around Dexter (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh in seasons 1–2; Candi Milo in seasons 3–4), a bespectacled boy-genius who possesses a secret laboratory {{hidden behind a}} bookcase in his bedroom. The laboratory is filled with Dexter's inventions and can be accessed by speaking various passwords or by activating hidden <b>switches</b> <b>on</b> Dexter's bookshelf (e.g. pulling out a specific book). Though highly intelligent, Dexter often fails at what he has {{set out to do}} when he becomes overexcited and makes careless choices. Although he comes from a typical all-American family, Dexter speaks with a thick accent of indeterminate origin. Christine Cavanaugh described it as [...] "an affectation, some kind of accent, we're not quite sure. A small Peter Lorre, but not. Perhaps he's Latino, perhaps he's French. He's a scientist; he knows he needs some kind of accent." [...] Genndy Tartakovsky explained, [...] "He considers himself a very serious scientist, and all well-known scientists have accents." ...|$|E
