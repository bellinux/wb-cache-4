50|$|Independent front {{suspension}} {{developed through}} the 1930s, for high-performance cars at least, often using double wishbone suspension. This performance also encouraged {{the reduction of}} unsprung weight. Rather than using separate pivots for both the up-and-down motion of the suspension and the <b>steering</b> <b>swivel,</b> {{the use of a}} spherical ball joint that could move in two degrees of freedom allowed the same joint to carry out both functions. The hub carrier extended vertically to span the ends of both wishbones, with a ball joint at each end. In the 1950s and 1960s, such independent suspension became commonplace through light cars in all price ranges. Although the kingpin was no longer an identifiable physical component, suspension geometry was still designed in terms of a virtual kingpin along a line between the ball joint centres.|$|E
