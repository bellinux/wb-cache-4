5|$|In August 1939 Cunningham rejoined his squadron, now {{equipped}} with {{a version of the}} Bristol Blenheim. His operator was Jimmy Rawnsley, who would serve as his gunner and radio operator for most of the war and contribute to all but three of Cunningham's victories.

5|$|In February and March 1942 the Allied {{position}} in New Guinea was under pressure and Japanese aircraft had been sighted over the Torres Strait Islands and Cape York in northern Australia. As a result, priority {{was given to}} basing a fighter squadron at Port Moresby in New Guinea to defend the town's important airfields and port facilities. The RAAF received an allocation of 25 P-40Kittyhawk fighters in late February that were flown to Townsville, Queensland, and used to form No.75 Squadron on 4March 1942. The need to reinforce Port Moresby's defences was so pressing that the squadron was allowed only nine days to train with the aircraft before it deployed. Commanded initially by <b>Squadron</b> <b>Leader</b> Peter Jeffrey, No.75 Squadron's advance party arrived in Port Moresby on 17March and its aircraft followed between the 19th (when <b>Squadron</b> <b>Leader</b> John Jackson assumed command) and 21st of the month. At this time only four of the squadron's 21 pilots, including its commander, had previously seen combat.|$|E
