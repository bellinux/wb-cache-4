40|$|<b>Valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>seal</b> leakage is a {{major source}} of {{fugitive}} emissions, and controlling these emissions can result in added expense in leak detection and repair programs. Elastomeric O-rings can be used as <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>seals,</b> and O-ring manufacturers recommend lubrication of elastomeric seals to prevent damage and to assure proper sealing. In this research, a metallic coating was applied as a lubricant using a vacuum vapor deposition process to the surface of elastomeric <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>seals.</b> <b>Valve</b> <b>stem</b> leak measurements were taken to determine if the coated O-rings, alone or with the recommended lubrication, reduced <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>seal</b> leakage.

40|$|Detailed exhaust {{emission}} data {{have been taken}} from a Cummins N- 14 single cylinder research engine in which the oil consumption was varied by different engine modifications. Low sulfur fuel was used, and oil consumption was varied by modifying the intake <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>seals,</b> the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>seals,</b> the oil control ring and combinations of these modifications. Detailed measurements of exhaust gas particle size distributions and chemical composition were made for the various oil consumption configurations {{for a range of}} engine loads and speeds. The particulate mass was measured with TEOM and traditional gravimetric filter methods. Filter data for EC/OC, sulfates and trace metals have been taken and analyzed. The trace metals in the particulate mass {{serve as the basis for}} assessing oil consumption at the different operating conditions. The data indicate that the oil consumption for the steady state testing done here was approximately an order of magnitude below oil consumption values cited in the literature. We did measure changes in the details of the chemical composition of the particulate for the different engine operating conditions, but it did not correlate with changes in the oil consumption. Furthermore, the data indicate that the particle size distribution is not strongly impacted by low level oil consumption variations observed in this work...|$|R

50|$|The <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> is a tube made {{of metal}} or rubber, {{through which the}} tire is inflated, with a check valve, {{typically}} a Schrader valve on automobiles and most bicycle tires, or a Presta valve on high-performance bicycles. <b>Valve</b> <b>stems</b> usually protrude through the wheel for easy access. They mount directly to the rim, {{in the case of}} tubeless tires, or {{are an integral part of}} the inner tube. The rubber in <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> eventually degrades, and, in the case of tubeless tires, replacement of the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> at regular intervals or with tire replacement reduces the chance of failure. Some may notice that their <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> is all metal with a nut retaining it (as opposed to the typical rubber stem with brass threads). Most modern passenger vehicles are now required to have a tire pressure monitoring system which usually consists of a <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> attached to an electronic module.
