Research is carried out by comparing the finite speed of penetration of this series at a speed of penetration of the elongated one-piece (rod) of the missile of the same mass and diameter. Examines the range of initial impact speeds from 1 to 12 km/s taking into account such physical phenomena as fracture, melting and evaporation of the interacting bodies. The analysis showed that almost in all range of impact speeds <b>segmented</b> <b>drummer</b> is better solid elongated...|$|R

50|$|Mercury clocks used a drum {{with several}} {{chambers}} that were connected through calibrated holes. A rope was wound around the drum with a weight connected to one end. The weight pulling down turned the drum, and the mercury in the drum chambers resisted the turning motion by slowly flowing from one <b>segment</b> of the <b>drum</b> to the next, thus inhibiting {{the movement of}} the drum and making it turn at a more or less constant speed. The movement of the drum could be used to measure time.|$|R

He starred as Larry the Dwarf in Frank Zappa's 200 Motels (1971). His voice is also featured in Harry Nilsson's animated film The Point! (1971).|$|R

Purpose: {{development of the}} procedure for calculating elastic contact interaction of equipment components, determination of their stress-deformed state, working-out of practical recommendations for designing of structural members. Methods of investigation: calculations {{with the use of}} a developed computer mathematical model, experimental strain-measuring investigation on physical parts. The results include the development of the algorithm for calculating the contact interaction of structural members and its use in programs, determination of the parameters of parts stress-deformed state substantiation of the necessity for accounting for the "external zones" on the working and back-up rolls during the calculation of roll system deformations.

2500|$|The film's {{original}} music <b>segments</b> are a <b>drum</b> score consisting {{entirely of}} solo jazz percussion performances by Antonio Sánchez. The score is offset {{by a number}} of well known classical music pieces, including Mahler and Tchaikovsky. Iñárritu did not regard the particular choice of classical pieces as important. Nonetheless, the choice of classical music was strongly oriented to highly melodic scores taken predominantly from the 19th century classical repertoire (Mahler, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Ravel). Iñárritu stated that the classical components come from the world of the play, citing the radio in Riggan's room and the show itself as two sources of the music. The classical music segments also included two compositions by American composer John Adams. Several jazz compositions by Victor Hernández Stumpfhauser and Joan Valent counterbalance the original music composition by Sánchez. The drum sections comprise the majority of the score however, and were composed by Sánchez. Iñárritu explained the choice by saying they helped to structure scenes, and that [...] "The drums, for me, was a great way to find the rhythm of the film... In comedy, rhythm is king, and not having the tools of editing to determine time and space, I knew I needed something to help me find the internal rhythm of the film." ...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISISin acceso a texto completoWe report {{experimental}} {{results on the}} motion and levitation of a freely to-move heavy cylinder, of constant diameter and varying mass, inside a water-filled drum rotating around its horizontal axis. The resulting flow field and the cylinder dynamics were determined {{with the aid of}} flow visualizations and particle image velocimetry methods. The spatial tracking of the inner cylinder was done with the aid of Fourier cross correlation methods. The steady bulk flow field created by the drum rotation generated forces that make the inner cylinder to counter-rotate without contact with the drum walls. Testing different cylinder masses and rotating drum frequencies has shown that there exists a range of stable spatial positions of the inner cylinder describing an angular <b>segment</b> inside the <b>drum</b> flow. The cylinder frequency can be set to zero if we increase the drum frequency beyond a threshold value. Increasing the drum frequency produces a stronger secondary flow circulation which is the key-mechanism responsible of the counterrotating cylinder frequency. At this point, the inner cylinder levitates with a constant separation from the drum walls close to half of its diameter. Tests on heavy hollow cylinders revealed that the fluid filling the cylinder remains at rest while the cylinder was under levitation with zero rotation frequency. Fondecyt 108502...|$|R
40|$|Radioactive waste must be {{characterized}} {{in order to}} verify its conformance with national regulations for intermediate storage or its disposal. Segmented gamma scanning (SGS) is a most widely applied non-destructive analytical technique for the characterization of radioactive waste drums. The isotope specific activity content is generally calculated assuming a homogeneous matrix and activity distribution for each measured <b>drum</b> <b>segment.</b> However, real radioactive waste drums exhibit non-uniform isotope and density distributions most affecting the reliability and accuracy of activities reconstruction in SGS. The presence of internal shielding structures in the waste drum contributes generally to a strong underestimation of the activity and this in particular for radioactive sources emitting low energy gamma-rays independently of their spatial distribution. In this work we present an improved method to quantify the activity of spatially concentrated gamma-emitting isotopes (point sources or hot spots) in heterogeneous waste drums with internal shielding structures. The isotope activity is reconstructed by numerical simulations and fits of the angular dependent count rate distribution recorded during the drum rotation in SGS using an analytical expression derived from a geometric model. First results of the improved method and enhancements of this method are shown and are compared {{to each other as}} well as to the conventional method which assumes a homogeneous matrix and activity distribution. It is shown that the new model improves the accuracy and the reliability of the activity reconstruction in SGS and that the presented algorithm is suitable with respect to the framework requirement of industrial application...|$|R
