5|$|A hemlock-mixed {{hardwood}} palustrine {{forest is}} present in the vicinity of Scotch Run east of the reservoir on the stream. The forest contains wooded wetlands and vernal pools. Trees inhabiting the forest include white oak, red oak, tulip poplar, yellow birch, eastern hemlock, American beech, and red maple. Other plants in the forest include teaberry, sphagnum moss, wood anemone, false hellebore, <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbage,</b> goldthread, and sensitive fern.|$|E
5|$|Five {{species of}} shrubs {{grow in the}} {{vicinity}} of Mahoning Creek, its floodplain, and the nearby slopes: smooth alder, silky dogwood, gray dogwood, spicebush, and American elderberry. 11 herb species also grow in this location. These include <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbage,</b> bloodroot, sensitive fern, sedge, wood anemone, woolgrass, and others. There are also invasive plants such as multiflora rose, Japanese knotweed, and garlic mustard in the area.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the cypress, the sanctuary protects many songbirds (prothonotary warbler, waterthrush), frogs (green frog, spring peeper) and several wildflower species (cardinal flower, jack-in-the-pulpit). <b>Skunk</b> <b>cabbages</b> emerge early each spring.|$|R
50|$|In {{warm weather}} a finch aviary among the {{blossoms}} complements the Flower Garden. The floral displays in 27 circular beds are changed frequently year-round. Nearby is a Bog Garden with day lilies, <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbages,</b> ornamental grasses and a six-foot leafed Gunnera plant.|$|R
5000|$|I get {{the feeling}} that through some {{oversight}} or taxonomical confusion (Mr. Greenan's books are difficult to classify, therefore hard to explain) not enough readers are aware of what delightful fun he is poking at the notion that human beings are superior to <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbages.</b>|$|R
5|$|Most {{land around}} the oxbow is steep. It {{is covered by}} hemlock and {{hardwood}} forests, as well as <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbage</b> seeps. The forests around the lake also contain black birch, yellow birch, white oak, red oak, sugar maple, tulip poplar, and Norway maple, while the understory contains slippery elm, European privet, Japanese barberry, American elderberry, wild hydrangea, witch hazel, mountain laurel, ironwood, and the rare American yew. The American yew population was in significant decline by 2004 due to heavy grazing by deer.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} old-growth forests with tree species and genera such as black oak, hickory, beech, cherry birch, sweetgum, red maple, and tuliptree. The forests also contain owls, bats, chipmunks, groundhogs, gypsy moths, rabbits, raccoons, opossums, coyotes. In addition, over 130 species of {{butterflies}} {{can be found}} in the park. In 1937, it was noted that the marshlands had fauna such as red-winged blackbirds, yellowthroats, green bottle flies, beetles, dragonflies, tadpoles, herons, kingfishers, and ospreys. Its flora included cattail, <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbage,</b> and moss.|$|E
5|$|The Chetco River {{watershed}} {{is covered}} primarily by temperate coniferous forest, which includes {{species such as}} Douglas fir, western hemlock, white fir, Port Orford cedar, California incense cedar, and Sitka spruce. Jeffrey pine, knobcone pine, and golden chinquapin have also been identified. Hardwoods including tanoak, bigleaf maple, red alder, and Pacific madrone are common. Manzanita, hazelnut, vine maple, western <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbage,</b> and multiple species of berries and grasses make up the understory. Kalmiopsis, a flowering evergreen shrub and the namesake of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, only grows in the Siskiyou Mountains. Several noxious weeds have also been identified, including gorse, Scotch broom, blackberries, and thistles.|$|E
5000|$|Located in {{the northwestern}} portion of the Kantō Plain, the village {{stretched}} from the summit of Mount Akagi to the bottom. At the summit of Mount Akagi, there are two lakes, Ōnuma and Konuma, caldera lakes. Alpine plants such as Asian <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbages</b> grow in the marshland. The northern portion of the village was mainly covered by forests without many human dwellings, while the southern portion was flat with farmland.|$|R
50|$|Snow {{around the}} house melted faster than {{anywhere}} else nearby, and <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbages</b> of prodigious size and unusual color sprouted out of the soil. The trees budded early and were observed to be moving even with no wind of any sort. Sprouting saxifrage bore the same unnatural hues as the cabbages. Within a few months, all plant life near the site took on unnatural properties and odd hues {{to the point where}} the road running near it fell into disuse, owing to people fearful of seeing such a sight.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the garden}} {{emphasis}} is placed on its educational potential; its collection is extensive and well-labelled and there are many posters describing points of botanical/ecological interest, designed to stimulate further interest in trees, especially amongst younger visitors. The collection includes numerous species and cultivars from Northern Asia, North America and other temperate regions around the world; it includes cultivars of Cornus kousa (Chinese dogwood), Liquidambar styraciflua (American sweetgum), Liriodendron (tulip tree) and various Betula (birch) species, as well as other woody plants from many different genera.The arboretum includes a 2007 planting of 75 Sequoiadendron giganteum, the well-known giant redwood from the mountains of Southern California, and this area of the arboretum is intended to become a redwood grove in the future. Britain's first [...] "Singing Sequoia" [...] was commissioned in BlueBell Arboretum in spring, 2013; this automated musical and educational feature is amongst a group planting of Coastal Redwoods, which fully-grown in California are the tallest trees in the world. The aim of this planting is to create a small-scale representation of a Californian redwood forest, complete with sword ferns, 'Polystichum munitum', growing beneath the redwoods and <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbages,</b> 'Lysichiton americanus', in a nearby damp area.|$|R
5|$|Vegetation: Most of {{the spray}} zone {{adjacent}} to the Falls is covered with patches of various mosses, liverworts, and other low herbaceous vegetation, including Eutrochium purpureum, Angelica atropurpurea, and Aster spp. In addition, watercress Nasturtium officinale increased after the 1993 flood event. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found on vegetation up to 92cm above the ground and at 1/3 the maximum sunlight intensities of the sympatric Succinea sp. B. Vegetation is quite sparse {{on the west side}} of the Falls, and the only snails that have been observed there are Succinea sp. B. In drier talus {{adjacent to the}} mossy areas are various plant species, such as eastern <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbage</b> Symplocarpus foetidus and Angelica atropurpurea, upon which Succinea sp. B has also been found. During periods of heavy water flow, dew, or rain, when the vegetation is saturated, the snails have been observed actively crawling on the vegetation. During drier times, both species of snails attach themselves to the underside of leaves with a mucous epiphragm. In the patch of watercress, the vegetation is dense and lush. Although the watercress is dominant, other species include Angelica atropurpurea, jewelweed Impatiens capensis and Impatiens pallida, forget-me-nots Myosotis scorpioides, various mints Mentha spp., and poison ivy Toxicodendron radicans, which again support Succinea sp. B but not Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. The ledges where Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is found clearly comprise an early successional sere, periodically rejuvenated to a bare rock substrate by flood waters.|$|E
25|$|The {{deciduous}} forest that brackets the stream features wetland areas categorized by sphagnum moss, cinnamon ferns, <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbage</b> and tulip trees. In late {{spring and early}} summer, hikers may chance upon the clump of grass-like leaves with a white to pale green bloom of the lily of the wildflower fly poison.|$|E
25|$|Plant life {{along the}} Kishwaukee is abundant. Various native flora from burr oaks, and lady's {{slippers}} to lousewort, and trilliums to trout lilies. <b>Skunk</b> <b>cabbage</b> blooms in late February {{and at the}} other end of the spectrum goldenrods and gentians bloom in late October, 1,070 species of plant are found in the Kishwaukee Basin, around 34% of the state's native vascular plants. Of that number 14 are listed as endangered in Illinois and another 14 as threatened in the state as of 1997. In addition the prairie bush clover is a federally threatened species that occurs in the basin.|$|E
60|$|Just {{a little}} way beyond Jimmy <b>Skunk</b> the runaway <b>cabbage</b> brought up with a thump against a stump on which sat Striped Chipmunk, with the pockets in his cheeks filled full of yellow corn. The sudden bump of the big cabbage made Striped Chipmunk lose his balance, and off he tumbled, right down on to old Mr. Toad, who had just sat down behind the stump {{for a few minutes}} of rest. It knocked all the wind out of Mr. Toad, and of course Striped Chipmunk spilled all his corn.|$|R
500|$|The valleys on {{the western}} side of the park support dense wet forests, with a thick understory. [...] The widest valleys, such as the Illecillewaet, contain a rare {{wetlands}} environment, featuring <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbage</b> and water hemlock. [...] Outside of the wetlands, the lower valleys are covered by Western Red cedar, western white pine, western hemlock, Interior douglas fir, and white birch. [...] Ground species include devil's club, blueberries, liverwort, and fern species.|$|E
500|$|Marsh shrews {{typically}} live in wetlands (such as marshes), {{and their}} habitat includes extensive forest canopy and ground cover from shrubs, logs, and debris; {{they may also}} be found in riparian environments. [...] During cold, rainy seasons, they may travel as much as a kilometer from wet areas to more sheltered habitats; these generally include mixed deciduous or coniferous forest with downed logs and surface cover. Marsh shrews have been collected from near sea level to as high as [...] in the Cascades. They may inhabit forests of red alder, bigleaf maple, western hemlock or redcedar, often near marshes with western <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbage.</b> In British Columbia the marsh shrew is generally found below , but it has been collected at [...] in Mount Seymour Provincial Park. Environmental officials in British Columbia believe that marsh shrews are one of the rarest small mammals in the province. In 1992, Carlos Galindo-Leal and Gustavo Zuleta trapped 1,000 small mammals at 55 locations in a large area of southwestern British Columbia; only three were Pacific water shrews.|$|E
500|$|Gardens in {{the upper}} park area include Longfellow Gardens, Minnehaha Falls Pergola Garden, and the Song of Hiawatha Garden. The lower glen area offers {{examples}} of a surprisingly large number of trees that are native to Minnesota including basswood, black ash, maples, oaks, willows, and cottonwoods. [...] Unusual plants include the first spring-blooming plant, <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbage,</b> often blooming so early that temperatures are still freezing and snow may still be on the ground. [...] As the name implies, they have a disagreeable odor except to the various insects that prefer to feed on rotting flesh or dung. By consuming carbohydrates stored in its fleshy roots, skunk cabbages can maintain a temperature inside the spathe that is 15–35 degrees warmer than the surrounding air temperature. The warmth helps attract cold-blooded, early-emerging pollinating insects during early spring when temperatures are still chilly. [...] As the spathe dies back the large, showy leaves emerge which die back by mid-August, making the plant difficult to find in late summer. Other wild flowers include wild ginger, trout lilies, anemones, marsh marigold and various ferns and sedges. [...] The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board is working to remove invasive species that have been introduced into the park {{in order to promote}} a healthy environment so that native species may survive and grow.|$|E
2500|$|In spring, {{salmonberry}} shoots and bracken fern fiddleheads were foraged, {{while men}} hunted deer or elk grazing on the <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbage</b> or the anthropogenic grasslands. [...] Camas from nearby prairies would be gathered or traded. [...] The grasslands encouraged berries, fern roots, bulbs and other useful plants. [...] Garry oaks, whose thick bark helps them survive fires, are {{typically associated with}} prairies, and their presence at Seward Park and Martha Washington Parks suggests that anthropogenic grasslands extended between them. [...] They may have been planted for their edible acorns.|$|E
2500|$|After being cleaned, the wila is {{traditionally}} cooked in a pit. [...] The pit {{is traditionally}} quite large, 1 to 3 m across and 60 to 90cm deep. [...] A fire is lit in the pit, and numerous rocks are heated {{up on the}} fire until they are very hot. [...] Some people sprinkle some dirt over the rocks {{after they have been}} heated up. [...] Then a thick layer of wet vegetation (perhaps moss, fern fronds, <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbage</b> leaves, bark, grass, or conifer needles) is used to cover the rocks and line the pit. [...] The wila is piled on top of this vegetation, almost always with layers of root vegetables or other food. [...] The lichen is then covered with more wet vegetation. [...] Often a barrier of large leaves, bark, reed mats, or burlap sacks is placed on top of all the vegetation to stop any detritus from falling into the food. [...] The entire thing is then covered over with a layer of dirt.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{confluence}} of the Jordan and Mill Creeks, the Jordan enters the preserve and heads north-north-east. [...] To its west, the Jordan is bounded by the imposing Mill Hill (along which the Theyken Ridge Trail runs). [...] Further downstream, Mill Hill recedes straight north as the Jordan turns east—Mill Hill's proximity to the Jordan is further distanced by a valley cut by Hegel's Run. [...] Hegel's Run is a perennial minor tributary of Jordan Creek, originating within <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbage</b> wetlands in the interior of the preserve. Flowing north to south, Hegel's Run continues out of the wetlands and parallel to the Fireman's trail where, along its course, it is fed by two smaller unnamed tributaries originating from springs on the sloping Mill Hill which are blanketed by a heavy canopy of autumn-olive and by a minor tributary originating to the northeast in the grassy Schantz valley. Hegel's Run flows further south where, after being crossed by the firemen's trail forms a confluence with Jordan Creek immediately upstream of Schlicher's Covered Bridge.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{geographical}} territory was {{abundant in}} rich food sources from land animals to sea life and plants and animals. For meat, deer, bear, elk, duck, swan, and small rodents such as squirrel. With ocean food it was mussels, sea eggs, cockles, clams, seaweed, herring, trout, crab, urchin, sea lion, seal, {{all kinds of}} salmon. [...] For berries and plants, it was different kinds of wild blueberry, blackberry, salmon berry, salal berry, five different kinds of grass and the roots of different plants. Ooligans were once in their river system and Ooligan grease was once made from it. [...] Sea food, particularly salmon was their main staple. [...] It was this abundance of sea food and salmon that their diet was considerably heavy on natural fats and oils. This left relatively small amounts of carbohydrates in the diet. [...] To ensure that essentials vitamins are acquired, they eat almost all parts of animals which they harvest. [...] Bones used for soup stock provide leached calcium, as do ground calcined shells. Vitamin A is obtained from liver. Vitamin C is primarily found in berries and some other plants, such as <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbage</b> leaves. Intestines and stomachs can be eaten to provide vitamin E and the vitamin B complexes. [...] Within the decade following the establishment of Fort Langley in 1827 the Squamish had begun extensive farming of potatoes. [...] Recent shifts away from a traditional diet, relatively low in carbs and sugar has led to many health problems in the present day Squamish community.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know." [...] Anne looked thoughtful. [...] "I {{read in a}} book {{once that}} a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but I've {{never been able to}} believe it. I don't believe a rose WOULD be as nice if it was called a thistle or a <b>skunk</b> <b>cabbage.</b> I suppose my father could have been a good man even if he had been called Jedediah; but I'm sure {{it would have been a}} cross. Well, my mother was a teacher in the High school, too, but when she married father she gave up teaching, of course. A husband was enough responsibility. Mrs. Thomas said that they were a pair of babies and as poor as church mice. They went to live in a weeny-teeny little yellow house in Bolingbroke. I've never seen that house, but I've {{imagined}} it thousands of times. I think it must have had honeysuckle over the parlor window and lilacs in the front yard and lilies of the valley just inside the gate. Yes, and muslin curtains in all the windows. Muslin curtains give a house such an air. I was born in that house. Mrs. Thomas said I was the homeliest baby she ever saw, I was so scrawny and tiny and nothing but eyes, but that mother thought I was perfectly beautiful. I should think a mother would be a better judge than a poor woman who came in to scrub, wouldn't you? I'm glad she was satisfied with me anyhow, I would feel so sad if I thought I was a disappointment to her--because she didn't live very long after that, you see. She died of fever when I was just three months old. I do wish she'd lived long enough for me to remember calling her mother. I think it would be so sweet to say 'mother,' don't you? And father died four days afterwards from fever too. That left me an orphan and folks were at their wits' end, so Mrs. Thomas said, what to do with me. You see, nobody wanted me even then. It seems to be my fate. Father and mother had both come from places far away and it was well known they hadn't any relatives living. Finally Mrs. Thomas said she'd take me, though she was poor and had a drunken husband. She brought me up by hand. Do you know if there is anything in being brought up by hand that ought to make people who are brought up that way better than other people? Because whenever I was naughty Mrs. Thomas would ask me how I could be such a bad girl when she had brought me up by hand--reproachful-like.|$|E
