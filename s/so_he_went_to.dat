Hope was hospitalized with pneumonia in 1967 and died a few weeks later, on May 19, of heart failure. His wife was aged 31 {{at the time of his}} death. They had three children; their daughter, Monica Hope, became a singer.|$|E

25|$|Bexley Hall is an Episcopal Church U.S.A. {{theological}} seminary {{founded in}} 1823 by Philander Chase, the Bishop of Ohio. Most of the East Coast Episcopal leadership {{did not see}} the need for another seminary, and denied financial support to Bishop Chase. <b>So</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> England and appealed to his Anglican / Church of England colleagues, and won their overwhelming support. A victorious Chase returned to Gambier, Ohio, and founded Kenyon College, an Episcopal liberal arts college. In conjunction with Kenyon, he opened the seminary on the same campus. Still in Gambier, Bexley Hall was eventually identified as a separate institution and named after one of Kenyon College's biggest benefactors, the retired English Chancellor of the Exchequer, coincidentally known as Lord Bexley. Bexley Hall remained affiliated with Kenyon College until 1968, when it broke ties with Kenyon and relocated to Rochester, New York, forming a new association with the Baptist seminary Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School. In 1998, Bexley Hall returned to its native Ohio, sharing a campus with Trinity Lutheran Seminary, also coincidentally located in Bexley. The aptly named seminary remains a part of the Episcopal Church USA.|$|E

Arbuckle then claimed Rappe told him she felt ill and asked to lie down, and that he carried her into the bedroom and asked a few of the party guests to help treat her. When Arbuckle {{and a few of the}} guests re-entered the room, they found Rappe on the floor near the bed tearing at her clothing and going into violent convulsions. To calm Rappe down, they placed her in a bathtub of cool water. Arbuckle and Fischbach then took her to room 1227 and called the hotel manager and doctor. After the doctor declared that Rappe was just drunk, Arbuckle then drove Taub to town.|$|E

However, a yearning to start a career in light entertainment and a contract to re-appear in Bert Graham and Will Bentley's concert party at the West Cliff Theatre caused him to return home after six months.|$|E
500|$|The subplot of [...] "The Mansion Family", where Mr. Burns gets {{a medical}} examination, was {{inspired}} by Swartzwelder's own visit to a Mayo Clinic.
