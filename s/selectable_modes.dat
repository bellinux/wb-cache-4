40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to the Dept. of Electronics & Telecommunication Eng. for the degree of Master of Science. CD-ROM IncludedIn this thesis a transformer less voltage source sine wave inverter is proposed. A previously developed tri-state boost converter is utilized for the stepping up operation. By using this topology the dynamic response of the inverter is increased, by avoiding the right hand plane zero in the converter’s small-signal control-to-output transfer function when operating in the continuous conduction mode. The reference voltage for the tri-state boost converter is determined from the measured output voltage of the sine wave inverter, and the calculated instantaneous value of the sine wave. The inverter with the tri-state boost converter and the inverter with a classical boost converter with voltage mode control and current mode control are compared for the dynamic response and efficiency. The analytical work of the design has been verified using a simulation. Furthermore, the boost converter is implemented in hardware to verify the boost inverter calculations. The current mode control and the tri-state logic hardware implementation is ongoing, and it is presented as future work.

40|$|The NOVA Fringe Tracker (NFT) is a {{proposed}} {{solution to the}} call by ESO for a second generation fringe tracking facility. This instrument at the VLTI will enable the cophasing of up to 6 telescopes simultaneously. Using broad band optics with detection from 1. 2 to 2. 4 microns, a unique configuration is employed that eliminates so-called “photometric crosstalk. ” This refers to imbalance in the beam combiner which results in fluctuations of the incoming wavefronts {{and the proportion of}} power accepted by a spatial filter masquerading as a visibility, a common problem afflicting previous interferometric instruments and fringe trackers. Also proposed for use in “science instruments ” (for the measurement of visibility), the “Polarization-Based Collimated Beam Combiner, ” with its achievement of photometric symmetry in hardware, is particularly suited for combined use of the smaller AT (1. 8 meter) telescopes with the UT (8 meter) telescopes involving a 20 : 1 intensity ratio of the interfering beams, and also for fringe tracking using highly resolved sources having a very small visibility.

40|$|Abstract Background Laser bio-stimulation is a {{well-established}} procedure in Medical Acupuncture. Nevertheless {{there is still}} a confusion as to whether it works or the effect is just placebo. Although a plethora of scientific papers published, showing positive clinical results, {{there is still a}} lack of objective scientific proofs about the bio-stimulation effect of lasers used in Acupuncture. The objective of this work was to design and build a body surface electrode and an amplifier for biopotential recording from acupuncture points, considered here as small localized bio-sources (SLB). The design is aimed for studying SLB potentials provoked by laser stimulus, in search for objective proofs of the bio-stimulation effect of lasers used in Medical Acupuncture. Methods The active electrode presented features a new adjustable anchoring system and fractionation of the biopotential amplifier between the electrode and the cabinet's location. The new adjustable electrode anchoring system is designed to reduce the electrode-skin contact impedance, its variation and motion artifacts. That is achieved by increasing the electrode-skin tension and decreasing its relative movement. Additionally the sensing element provides local constant skin stretching thus eliminating the contribution of the skin potential artifact. The electrode is attached to the skin by a double-sided adhesive pad, where the sensing element is a stainless steel, 4 mm in diameter. The fractionation of the biopotential amplifier is done by incorporating the amplifier's front-end op-amps at the electrodes, thus avoiding the use of extra buffers. The biopotential amplifier features two <b>selectable</b> <b>modes</b> of operation: semi-AC-mode with a - 3 dB bandwidth of 0. 32 – 1000 Hz and AC-mode with a bandwidth of 0. 16 – 1000 Hz. Results The average measured DC electrode-skin contact impedance of the proposed electrode was 450 kΩ, with electrode tension of 0. 3 kg/cm 2 on an unprepared skin of the inner forearm. The peak-to-peak noise voltage measured at the amplifier output, with input terminals connected to common, was 10 mV p-p, or 2 μV p-p referred to the input. The common-mode rejection ratio of the amplifier was 96 dB at 50 Hz, measured with imbalanced electrodes' impedances. The prototype was also tested practically and sample records were obtained after a low intensity SLB laser stimulation. All measurements showed almost a complete absence of 50 Hz interference, although no electrolyte gel or skin preparation was applied. Conclusion The results showed that the new active electrode presented significantly reduced the electrode-skin impedance, its variation and motion artifact influences. This allowed SLB signals with relatively high quality to be recorded without skin preparation. The design offers low noise and major reduction in parts, size and power consumption. The active electrode specifications were found to be better or at least comparable to those of other existing designs. </p...|$|E
