The most efficient contributions to system reliability enhancement {{can be found}} in probabilistic methods applicable to real transmission grids. One aim of the research was also to get an estimate of the Finnish 400  kV transmission grid reliability. The method developed in this thesis takes into account the effect of the following issues: frequency of line faults, fault location on the line, protection system, different <b>substation</b> <b>structures,</b> failure rates of substation components and the dynamic behaviour of the power system after different contingencies. Mathematical modelling and computational methods were used in this research. Statistical analyses for the estimation of initiating events such as line faults were made. A failure mode and effect analysis was made for substation components using both the Finnish 400  kV device-failure database and expert judgments. Reliability analyses for substation post-fault operations were made with event and fault trees. Different event tree end states (fault duration and circuit breaker trips) were then simulated with a power system dynamic analysis program using a particular load flow and grid topology. The dynamic analysis results were classified as secure, alert, emergency and system breakdown. A special alert case 'partial system breakdown' was also classified. The event trees were then reanalysed, now focusing on the power system states rather than the substation consequences. The method was applied to the Finnish transmission system and some quantitative estimates for grid reliability were obtained. Several grid-level importance measures (Fussell-Vesely, risk decrease factor, risk increase factor and sensitivity of parameters) for substation components and model parameters, as well as estimates of the total and partial system breakdown frequencies, were calculated. In this way, the relative importance of the substation components regarding the total and partial system breakdown was reached. Contributing factors to partial and total system breakdown after line faults were also found and ranked. On the basis of the results, some recommendations for improving the transmission grid reliability, in terms of maintenance planning and investments, were made. reviewe...|$|E

In this thesis, {{earthquake}} {{performance of}} an existing <b>substation</b> <b>structure</b> which was designed in 1989 is investigated through displacement and force-based assessment procedures. Destructive earthquakes cause loss of life and property aspecially in the high population and industrial zones. Besides these losses, many industrial plants became unserviceable and national economy was damaged.   Seismic Code of Turkey (2007) {{is one of the}} codes which state the design requirements for buildings to be built in disaster areas and also the assessment requirements for existing buildings in disaster areas. As expected, it is not an easy task to give compatible methods applicable for buildings to be designed and for buildings to be assessed. The methods in the Code take into account directly or indirectly non-linear behavior of the structure, when the seismic effects are considered. However, the non-linear behavior of a structure can be considered in various ways, as it is the case in the seismic codes. The adoption of a seismic load reduction factor is one of them. On the other hand the use of the principles of the capacity design is another way of taking into account the non-linear capacity of the structural elements.   The use of the seismic load reduction factor is easy to apply and probably for this reason it is adopted widely by the large number of seismic codes. In a common application of the seismic force reduction factor it is applied to all elements of the structures disregarding the ductility degree of the individual elements. This type of the application of the seismic force reduction factor {{can be found in the}} Turkish Seismic Code for buildings to be designed as well. This application can be found in the equivalent static load method, the multi mode method and the time domain analysis method stated by the Code. However, the Code requires that the nonlinear behavior of the existing structures should be considered by a parameter which may be regarded as a load reduction factor which depends on the type of the elements as well as on the type and degree of the internal force. In fact this is much more realistic approach that the application of the global force reduction factor to all structural elements, provided that the information level of the element of the structure is high. In the Code there is an alternative method as well, where the nonlinear behavior of the structures is taken into account by using the plastic hinge hypothesis under the assumption that enough information exists for the structural elements for defining the characteristics of the hinge. In this case single or multi mode pushover analysis is applied for evaluating the lateral load capacity of the structure beyond the elastic range. Structural engineering experts and other authorities concur on the opinion that the seismic performance assessment of constructed facilities is an important subject. The aim of the performance based evaluation is generally to predict the damage (inelastic deformations) of the structure under expected earthquakes and to determine whether the structural system has enough ductility to support those inelastic deformations and whether those inelastic deformations are acceptable by the owner of the building. For the performance based evaluation, various approaches are developed which can be considered in two groups. First one is the linear methods. Engineers are familiar to the linear methods and they use them in everyday engineering design practice. Second one is the nonlinear methods which are more realistic than the linear ones to simulate the behavior of structures under earthquake. Non-linear methods can be also categorized as Nonlinear Static Procedure and Nonlinear Dynamic Procedure based on the time dependence of the procedure. Nonlinear Static Procedure (NSP) so called pushover analysis has a widespread use in practice. The main effort of the performance evaluation in NSP is to obtain the seismic capacity curve and the target displacement of the structural system under considered earthquake. The capacity curve of a structural system is obtained from a nonlinear model which includes force-deformation relations of the cross-sections, i. e., bending moment-rotation relations. Pushover analysis is applied by adopting a lateral load pattern compatible to the first mode shape. The capacity curve of the system represents a non-linear relationship between the lateral load and the top displacement and shows the weak and the strong points of the system. The displacement demand of the SDOF system is determined by using the effective period, the relevant spectrum and the displacement modification factors. The seismic deformation demands of the structural components are determined due to the performance point of the structure. Deformation demands are checked as if they can be compensated by the existing capacity of the section. At the first section of the thesis, the topic is introduced and a summary of literature is presented.   In the second section, seismic performance levels of the examined <b>substation</b> <b>structure</b> are determined according to two different methods which are available in “Specification for Buildings to be Built in Earthquake Regions” put into force in 2007. Equivalent seismic load method with linear elastic evaluation approach is a force-based approach. This force-based method takes into account the ductile behavior of the structure indirectly through the seismic load reduction factors and capacity design principles. In accordance with this approach, base shear force is distributed to each storey considering mass participating ratios and internal forces are obtained. Structural performance is determined with these internal forces and member capacities. Incremental equivalent seismic load method is a non-linear seismic assessment procedure. As a matter of fact, this method which takes into account inelastic behaviour can be used in direct determination of internal force and deformation demand of the structure under the earthquake. At the third section several rehabilitation methods are studied for improving earthquake performance of existing structure. In the fourth section these methods are examined and evaluated in a comperative manner. Moreover, in this section all consequences of analysis are explained for all evaluation approaches.   In conclusion, material properties, reinforcement size and reinforcement layout of the examined <b>substation</b> <b>structure</b> is included in Appendix-A. Besides, loads which are assigned to the structure for SAP 2000 analysis is presented in Appendix-B. Finally, in Appendix-C, all member end forces and damage failures of the members for equivalent seismic load method are submitted. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R

40|$|Through {{accidental}} and intentional introductions, {{the monk}} parakeet, native to South America, is now established in several {{parts of the}} United States. In Florida, it occurs in 21 of 67 counties. Monk parakeets build a bulky nest structure of sticks, and they often build on electric utility <b>substations</b> and support <b>structures</b> for distribution and transmission lines. This nesting activity is incompatible with reliable electric service because nest material creates short circuits that cause power outages. Nest removal by electric utility personnel is ongoing but provides only short-term relief, as buds readily rebuild their nests. In h s study, we evaluated passive and active methods to trap monk parakeets, and we documented the effectiveness of trapping to reduce rates of nest rebuilding on distribution poles. At electric substations, we tested two passive trap designs: a drop-in style trap, and a walk-in style trap. Monk parakeets were wary of traps, however, and were not easily captured even with extensive pre-baiting {{and the use of}} decoy birds. At distribution poles, we actively trapped birds at 47 nest sites using specially designed nets placed over nest entrances at night while birds roosted. Birds were then caught as they flew out of the nests into the net. Capture success at individual nest sites ranged from 0 to 100 % with an overall average of 51 %. Of the 47 sites where birds were trapped at night, 43 nests were removed immediately or shortly after netting. Subsequent monitoring revealed that higher nest site capture rates resulted in slower rates of nest rebuilding. We conclude that while {{more research is needed to}} design an effective passive trapping system, monk parakeets can be readily trapped from distribution pole nests at night thereby enhancing nest removal efforts...|$|R

Located several kilometres offshore, the transmission cable resistance becomes substantial. To limit the losses, the voltage in the cables is increased in a <b>substation.</b> As this <b>structure</b> is often the largest in a wind farm, profits can be expected when optimizing this topside structure. Topside structures for the oil & gas industry generally require to be ventilated {{in order to prevent}} gas stacking. The equipment in the substation module, however, is vulnerable for the corrosive sea environment. Therefore, the structure needs to be sheltered. Hereby, the question rises if a weight reduction can be obtained by incorporating the shelter in the structural design. The thesis is carried out at Iv-Oil & Gas, who provided the basis of a comparative case study. For the research to be generally applicable, the case study design is simplified. Then a frame form the simplified model is chosen as a basis for the comparison. For a single governing load combination, two designs are constructed: a beam-column design complying to the conventional oil & gas design practice and a stressed skin design that incorporates the sheltering wall as a structural element. Both of the designs are then compared on steel mass and weld labour. The stressed skin design is found to be considerably lighter than the beam-column design. However, in terms of welds, the stressed skin design consists of a higher weld volume and a higher weld pass length. These aspects contribute to the total manufacturing costs of the design. Concluding, both of the designs have their advantages and disadvantages. It is made clear that applying the dividing wall as a structural element in the format of a stressed skin design provides a competitive design in terms of structural mass and weld labour. The final conclusions based on the comparison may vary dependent on the resources available at the manufacturer.
