40|$|Purpose: A {{system to}} measure the {{visibility}} of agricultural tractor operators was designed and evaluated according to ISO standards, and a blind area diagram around the tested tractor was created based on the manual method recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Methods: A visibility measurement system was designed and evaluated based on the ISO 5006 and ISO 5721 - 1 standards. Two bulbs used to simulate the operator's eyes were mounted on a bar with a supporting frame. A wooden frame {{was used to determine}} the seat index point position. The 12 -m visibility test circle was divided into six <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> and the test tractor was placed {{at the center of the}} circle. Artificial light was supplied in the darkened environment, and shadow or masking effects were measured manually around the 12 -m circle. Results: When the bulbs were placed at the operator’s eye level, front visibility was good; no masking was found in the “A ” vision sector, but larger masking widths were found in the “B ” and “C ” vision sectors. Since the masking width exceeded 700 mm, additional tests, such as movement of the light sources to both sides of the operator’s eye level, were performed. Less than six masking effects were found in the semi-circle <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> to the front, and more than one masking was found in the “B ” and “C ” visual fields. The minimum distance between the centers of two masking effects exceeded 2500 mm when measured as a chord on the semi-circle <b>of</b> <b>vision.</b> A blind area diagram was created to define the exact nature of the blind spots and mirror visibility. Conclusions: Visibility evaluation is an effective way to enable proper and safe operation for agricultural tractor operators. Inclusion of this visibility evaluation test in the general testing process might aid tracto...|$|R

40|$|Abstract There {{are many}} studies {{focusing}} on Karabuk province, {{which is one}} of the most important iron-steel manufacturing centers in Turkey, and the developing iron-steel sector in this province. This iron-steel sector and Karabuk as a whole have undergone many transformations due to the following factors: the privatization of the national iron-steel factory, Kardemir; the foundation of Karabuk University; and the implementation of training programs for steelworkers and an Iron and Steel Institute for students by Karabuk University. These factors suggest that the changes in Karabuk province are ongoing ones that will have a rapid and favorable effect on the society. To follow this change, it is necessary to have periodic studies <b>of</b> the iron-steel <b>sector</b> in Karabuk. This study empirically examines on such variables as socio-economic status, job satisfaction, and <b>sector</b> <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> the steelworkers...|$|R

This paper intends to assess the current, as well as to disentangle potentials for further tourism development of Krusevo, as a famous destinations in Macedonia.

In order to meet the research aims, the quantitative approach is mainly used by conducting a survey among four target groups, thus covering the demand and supply side. The overall conclusion is that the destination has profound limiting factors for tourism development.

50|$|The cone <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> a flame {{detector}} {{is determined by}} the shape and size of the window and the housing and the location of the sensor in the housing. For infrared sensors also the lamination of the sensor material plays a part; it limits the cone <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the {{flame detector}}. A wide cone <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> does not automatically mean that the flame detector is better. For some applications the flame detector needs to be aligned precisely to take care that it does not detect potential background radiation sources. The cone <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the flame detector is three dimensional and is not necessarily perfectly round. The horizontal angle <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> and the vertical angle <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> often differ; this is mostly caused by the shape of the housing and by mirroring parts (meant for the self test). Different combustibles can even have a different angle <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> in the same flame detector. Very important is the sensitivity at angles of 45°. Here at least 50% of the maximum sensitivity at the central axis must be achieved. Some flame detectors here achieve 70% or more. In fact these flame detectors have a total horizontal angle <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> more than 90°, but most of the manufacturers do not mention this. A high sensitivity on the edges of the angle <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> provides advantages for the projection of a flame detector.|$|R

40|$|Patients often {{perceive}} a detachment of the retina as a deterioration of their visus and/or {{the reduction of}} their field <b>of</b> <b>vision.</b> Whereas the measuring of the visus is an established method to assess the results in retinal surgery, {{the assessment of the}} field <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> is only <b>of</b> minor importance. The present dissertation introduces a method (the quantitative classification of the field <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> (QCFV)) that allows us to exactly quantify the hand-drawn sketches of the field <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> in the patients’ records. This method was used on a collective of patients who underwent retinal surgery 10 years ago, because it could be expected that the data of these patients’ reports kept in the central archive were as complete as possible. Moreover the results of the quantification of the field <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> as an objective method to assess the success when operating retinal detachment were compared to the findings of visus-measuring and to the fundoscopic assessment of the reattachment of the retina. First a method was developed with which the field <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> could be quantified based on the hand-drawn perimetry sketches in the patients’ reports. The examination of quantitative perimetry with defined, differently configured test-fields proved the method to be reliable. So the method is also suitable for the quantification of the perimetric sketches of the visional field. An exemplary collective of patients was used to prove that the all-over development of visus and the field <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> following an operation of retinal detachment showed similar tendencies (the visus remained unaltered or improved in 67 % of all cases, the field <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> expanded in 53 %). Although the development of visus and of the field <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> did not differ when the whole collective was looked at, the development of the visus of individual patients was contrary to that of their field <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> in more that 25 % of all cases. Therefore the development of visus and that of the field <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> are criteria to be looked at independently with each single patient in order to assess the success of an operation. The results show that the total improvement – or in only a few cases the damage – the patient experiences because of an operation of retinal detachment is not sufficiently described by stating the visus or the fundoscopic results showing the reattachment of the retina. For the patient the discernible changes in his field <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> are a criterion to judge the operational success. So the quantification of the field <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> probably makes an important contribution here. In future the evaluation of different parts of the field <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> should be taken into account...|$|R
