40|$|In {{order to}} obtain better performance, gas {{turbines}} always operate with high inlet temperature. This contributes to {{a high level of}} thermal load on the first stage vane endwall. To ensure safe operation of a gas turbine within a proper temperature range, the cooling performance of the vane endwall must be further investigated. In the present study, effects of the mainstream turbulence and upstream coolant flow direction on the endwall cooling and vane <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> surface phantom cooling were numerically investigated. Three-dimensional (3 D) Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations combined with shear stress transport (SST) k-ω turbulence model were solved to conduct the numerical simulations on basis of the validated turbulence model. The calculated results indicate that both the adiabatic cooling effectiveness on the endwall and the phantom cooling effectiveness on the vane <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> surface are significantly influenced by slot injection angle. For α=- 30 °, the coolant injection is driven towards the vane <b>suction</b> <b>side,</b> which contributes to the lowest adiabatic cooling effectiveness level on the pressure side endwall and the highest phantom cooling effectiveness level on the vane <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> surface. With the increase of the slot injection angle, the adiabatic cooling effectiveness level on the pressure side endwall is enhanced significantly. In contrast, the phantom cooling (when the vane <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> is cooled by coolant originating from the endwall) of the vane <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> surface is reduced significantly. This is because a large slot injection angle leads to a large coolant momentum towards the pressure side. Moreover, the case with a smaller slot injection angle obtains a slightly higher area-averaged adiabatic cooling effectiveness level around the leading edge due to a relatively larger portion of coolant being confined near the leading edge. In addition, the inlet turbulence intensity has a small impact on the overall endwall cooling and the phantom cooling of the vane <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> surface compared to the slot injection angle...|$|R

A simple flat blade with an inclined 30 ° film hole, which is parallel to the hot mainstream, was installed.

A steady liquid crystal technique was applied to obtain detailed distribution of the temperature over the blade surface.

Five different rotational speeds, i. e., 0, 300, 500, 800, 1000 r/min, were considered. Experimental results indicate that the film trajectory could bend under the rotating condition. With the increase of the rotational speed, on the pressure side, the film trajectory inclines centripetally firstly and then centrifugally; whereas, on the <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> the film trajectory bends centrifugally.

The leakage flow, mainly induced by the pressure differential between the pressure <b>side</b> and <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> of a rotor tip section, usually rolls into a streamwise vortical structure near the <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> part of the blade tip. The current study uses the concept of a tip platform extension that is a very short “winglet ” obtained by slightly extending the tip platform in the tangential direction. The use of a pressure side tip extension can significantly affect the local aerodynamic field by weakening the leakage vortex structure.

40|$|Abstract—Tip vortex {{cavitation}} {{is one of}} {{well known}} patterns of cavitation phenomenon which occurs in axial pumps. This pattern of cavitation occurs due to pressure difference between the pressure and <b>suction</b> <b>sides</b> of blades of an axial pump. Since the pressure in the pressure side of the blade {{is higher than the}} pressure in its <b>suction</b> <b>side,</b> thus a very small portion of liquid flow flows back from pressure <b>side</b> to the <b>suction</b> <b>side.</b> This fact is cause of tip vortex cavitation and gap cavitation that may occur in axial pumps. In this paper the results of our experimental investigation about movement of tip vortex cavitation along blade edge due to reduction of pump flow rate in an axial pump is reported. Results show that reduction of pump flow rate in conjunction with increasing of outlet pressure causes movement of tip vortex cavitation along blade edge towards the blade tip. Results also show that by approaching tip vortex cavitation to the blade tip, vortex tip pattern of cavitation replaces with a cavitation phenomenon on the blade tip. Furthermore by further reduction of pump flow rate and increasing of outlet pressure, an unstable cavitation phenomenon occurs between each blade leading edge and the next blade trailing edge...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{flow field}} in a {{centrifugal}} fan is highly complex with flow reversal {{taking place on}} the <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> of impeller and diffuser vanes. Generally performance of the centrifugal fan could be enhanced by judiciously introducing splitter vanes so as to improve the diffusion process. An extensive numerical whole field analysis {{on the effect of}} splitter vanes placed in discrete regions of suspected separation points is possible using CFD. This paper examines the effect of splitter vanes corresponding to various geometrical locations on the impeller and diffuser. The analysis shows that the splitter vanes located near the diffuser exit improves the static pressure recovery across the diffusing domain to a larger extent. Also it is found that splitter vanes located at the impeller trailing edge and diffuser leading edge at the mid-span of the circumferential distance between the blades show a marginal improvement in the static pressure recovery across the fan. However, splitters provided near to the <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> of the impeller trailing edge (25 % of the circumferential gap between the impeller blades towards the <b>suction</b> <b>side),</b> adversely affect the static pressure recovery of the fan.
