Because in type III Hoffa fractures, the fracture line is oblique and the fracture fragment in the intercondylar notch is big enough to insert a screw. But in type I Hoffa fractures, the fracture line is vertical and the screw entry point must be closed to the weight-bearing area of the articular cartilage.|$|R
50|$|Monobrowlines are {{a variant}} of browlines in which the bridge is {{contiguous}} with the caps, creating a solid, unbroken line {{across the top of}} the frame.

The original stag had no metal chassis: the lenses were mounted directly to the brow caps via two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>screws.</b> The modern monobrowline originated in the 1980s, as part of an effort by Bausch and Lomb to diversify their Ray-Ban sunglass collection with the Wayfarer Max, a fusion of the then-popular Wayfarer and Clubmaster sunglass models. The style proved unpopular and was quickly phased out. The monobrowline design was resurrected by a variety of manufacturers in the 2010s (chiefly Oakley) after browlines returned to popularity.

40|$|Fractures of long {{bones are}} {{sometimes}} treated using {{various types of}} fracture fixation devices including internal plate fixators. These are specialised plates which are used to bridge the fracture gap(s) whilst anatomically aligning the bone fragments. The plate is secured in position by <b>screws.</b> The aim <b>of</b> such a device is to support and promote the natural healing of the bone. When using an internal fixation device, {{it is necessary for}} the clinician to decide upon many parameters, for example, the type of plate and where to position it; how many and where to position the screws. While {{there have been a number}} of experimental and computational studies conducted regarding the configuration <b>of</b> <b>screws</b> in the literature, there is still inadequate information available concerning the influence <b>of</b> <b>screw</b> configuration on fracture healing. Because screw configuration influences the amount of flexibility at the area of fracture, it has a direct influence on the fracture healing process. Therefore, it is important that the chosen screw configuration does not inhibit the healing process. In addition to the impact on the fracture healing process, screw configuration plays an important role in the distribution of stresses in the plate due to the applied loads. A plate that experiences high stresses is prone to early failure. Hence, the screw configuration used should not encourage the occurrence of high stresses. This project develops a computational program in Fortran programming language to perform mathematical optimisation to determine the <b>screw</b> configuration <b>of</b> an internal fixation device within constraints of interfragmentary movement by minimising the corresponding stress in the plate. Thus, the optimal solution suggests the positioning and number <b>of</b> <b>screws</b> which satisfies the predefined constraints of interfragmentary movements. For a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>screw</b> configurations the interfragmentary displacement and the stress occurring in the plate were calculated by the Finite Element Method. The screw configurations were iteratively changed and each time the corresponding interfragmentary displacements were compared with predefined constraints. Additionally, the corresponding stress was compared with the previously calculated stress value to determine if there was a reduction. These processes were continued until an optimal solution was achieved. The optimisation program has been shown to successfully predict the optimal screw configuration in two cases. The first case was a simplified bone construct whereby the screw configuration solution was comparable with those recommended in biomechanical literature. The second case was a femoral construct, of which the resultant screw configuration was shown to be similar to those used in clinical cases. The optimisation method and programming developed in this study has shown that it has potential to be used for further investigations with the improvement of optimisation criteria and the efficiency of the program...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the study and {{extension}} <b>of</b> <b>screw</b> image space and its application to kinematic restraint and robotic grasping. In the study of restraint and robotic grasping, problems arise in relation to how to map the conditions and requirements of restraint in a special representational space, and how to map an object in the same space, so that all analysis and synthesis can be performed and further developed in such a space. Meanwhile, it is desirable that such a space would allow us to establish a relationship between equilibrium and geometry of a restraint circumstance, and also a relationship between geometry and algebra. The study is to introduce the restraint mapping in a newly extended screw image space. With the help of a new look at the properties <b>of</b> <b>screws</b> and screw systems, the screw image space is extended with its relevant spaces, the relationship among them is clarified together with a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> definitions. The <b>screw</b> image space is further completed with the study of its entities including hyperplanes, simplexes and polytopes, and further with the partition of the space. A framework is thus established and associated to restraint mapping and the extension <b>of</b> <b>screw</b> image space, and a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> theories is developed to study the entities in screw image space and to apply them to the restraint mapping. The study is based on the linear dependence <b>of</b> <b>screws</b> with detailed algebraic reasoning, which puts forward new properties <b>of</b> zero pitch <b>screw</b> combinations and theory of linear dependence <b>of</b> reciprocal <b>screw</b> systems together with algebraic and geometric reasoning. The study is successfully applied to kinematic restraint and robotic grasping with a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> theorems and methodologies, not only by mapping the restraint of an object, but also by mapping a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> restraint <b>screws</b> along the surface of an object. The graspability of an arbitrary object can thus be determined, the planning and optimisation can be carried out in the screw image space, together with three new invariant quality measures. An optimal grasp is hence achieved with isotropic resistance to arbitrary externally applied forces. The mapping and entities in screw image space are further weighted to account for the stiffness of contacts in dealing with frictional restraint, and planning is thus based on a stiffness weighted mapping. The planning and optimisation are further given in the concept of normal related restraint, and are achieved in the relevant screw image spaces. An augmented space is then established with the introduction of an affine condition. The relationship between the affine solution and the volumetric ratios of sub-simplexes to an n-simplex reconciles the quality measures with the optimisation. With the further introduction of elastic compatibility, frictional grasps are decomposed, and the force equation of equilibrium is augmented. The approach makes it possible to plan grasps in screw image space and to solve them in augmented space. The approach is further used to predict the failure of a specific case of grasping, and gives a satisfactory result, when compared with an experimental result. The final phase of the study is applied to the unknown grasping of unknown objects. By aggregating contact normals and their position vectors of an unknown object by means of newly developed tactile fingertip detectors, and by mapping them into screw image space, the description of an unknown object is completed. The planning and optimisation can thus operate in screw image space, giving a sufficient prediction of a grasp to be applied on the object. Examples and case studies are given through the thesis. Experiments are quoted to demonstrate the implementation of the new system of theories and methodologies in this Thesis. Further, a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> strategies and their methodology is given and incorporated into a package in C++ with a general application to the study <b>of</b> restraint in <b>screw</b> image space. The thesis ends with a concluding chapter reviewing the contents of the thesis and the main achievements of the study, proposing suggestions for further work...|$|R
