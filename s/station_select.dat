The channel was named {{as an extension of}} CITY-TV's newscasts, which were then known as CityPulse. For the first 10 years after its inception, CP24's programming was anchored and featured reports from Citytv personalities, live CityPulse news broadcasts were immediately repeated on CP24 after their initial broadcast on CITY-TV (except for breaking news coverage), and special coverage was simulcast between the channel and the television <b>station.</b> <b>Select</b> programming from other CHUM stations would also be featured on the channel including The NewMusic and Fashion Television.|$|E

It continues in the same manner for scheduling outstanding multicast transmissions, if any, for subsequent time slots. At each time slot t, the process proceeds in an iterative manner, whereby the selection of the (k- 1)-st addition of a base station to the transmission schedule is followed by considering the residual base <b>stations</b> and <b>selecting,</b> when feasible, the k-th addition of a base station to the schedule.|$|R

40|$|Abstract A few {{aspects of}} spatial variability, {{connected}} with climate variability, in the Rio de la Plata basin are analysed through {{changes in the}} basin runoff considered as indicative of the annual integrated precipitation. Those changes contain better information on climate variability than the sparse records of precipitation and temperature {{in view of the}} high spatial and temporal variability of those parameters. The precipitation data are applied in the most active zones of the basin, however, in order to assess aspects of hydrological variability that the lack of data causes in the studied region. The hydrological series employed correspond to average monthly and yearly flows at <b>stations</b> <b>selected</b> along the main rivers, both due to stability in their gauging stations and to the availability and quality of data for the 1931 - 1992 period. This period includes the longest series of simultaneous observations for the <b>stations</b> <b>selected.</b> Similar approaches were applied to the series of precipitation. Through basic statistical analysis, and from the annual evolution of flow...|$|R
