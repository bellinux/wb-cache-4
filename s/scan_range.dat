40|$|The <b>scan</b> <b>range</b> of {{an antenna}} array can be {{increased}} by providing a degree of curvature to its structure. However, achieving a wide <b>scan</b> <b>range</b> with an antenna array with limited number of elements is a challenging design issue. In this study,a novel 8 -element linear array of polarisation reconﬁgurable antennas conformed to four different array structures; namely 2 -faceted, 3 -faceted, 4 -faceted and 8 -faceted are analysed and synthesised. Observations are made on the inﬂuence of the tilting angle of the faceted structures to the geometrical characteristics and the <b>scan</b> <b>range</b> of the array.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of speckle reduction using traditional frame averaging technique was limited in ultrahigh speed {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT). As the motion between repeated frames was very small, the speckle pattern of the frames might be identical. This problem could be solved by averaging frames acquired at slightly different locations. The optimized <b>scan</b> <b>range</b> depended on the spot size of the laser beam, the smoothness of the boundary, and the homogeneity of the tissue. In this study we presented a method to average frames obtained within a narrow range along the slow-axis. A swept-source OCT with 100, 000 Hz axial scan rate was used to scan the retina in vivo. A series of narrow raster scans (0 - 50 micron along the slow axis) were evaluated. Each scan contained 20 image frames evenly distributed in the <b>scan</b> <b>range.</b> The imaging frame rate was 417 HZ. Only frames with high correlation after rigid registration were used in averaging. The result showed that the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) increased with the <b>scan</b> <b>range.</b> But the best edge reservation was obtained with 15 micron <b>scan</b> <b>range.</b> Thus, for ultrahigh speed OCT systems, averaging frames from a narrow band along the slow-axis could achieve better speckle reduction than traditional frame averaging techniques...|$|E

Therefore, in this Monte Carlo study based on the phantom of a 11 -year-old Iranian boy, the effect of using an optimized shield on dose reduction to body organs was quantified. Based on the impact of shield on image quality, lead shields with thicknesses of 0. 2 and 0. 4 mm were considered for organs exposed directly and indirectly in the <b>scan</b> <b>range,</b> respectively.

The array consists of 64 resonant aperture stacked patch (ASP) antennas. An element spacing of 16. 5 mm ensures that no grating lobes occur over the entire <b>scan</b> <b>range.</b> A <b>scan</b> <b>range</b> of - 55 &# 176; to 55 &# 176; and - 45 &# 176; to 45 &# 176; have been achieved in the E-plane and H- plane respectively.

Methods to improve the <b>scan</b> <b>range</b> and the reflection coefficient such as electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) material, defected ground structures (DGS), and adaptive matching circuits was investigated.

The efficiency of the array is 0. 96 which is an important result considering that 50 W is to be applied to each element. The antenna element used in the array was based on a design developed during the specialization project.
