Using an uncertainty analysis, theoretical expressions for Oh are found for the <b>slow</b> <b>transient</b> case, and these expressions are in excellent agreement with values computed using a Monte Carlo method.

40|$|While {{synoptic}} {{surveys in}} the optical and at high energies have revealed a rich discovery phase space of <b>slow</b> <b>transients,</b> a similar yield is still awaited in the radio. Majority {{of the past}} blind surveys, carried out with radio interferometers, have suffered from a low yield of <b>slow</b> <b>transients,</b> ambiguous transient classifications, and contamination by false positives. The newly-refurbished Karl G. Jansky Array (Jansky VLA) offers wider bandwidths for accurate RFI excision as well as substantially-improved sensitivity and survey speed compared with the old VLA. The Jansky VLA thus eliminates the pitfalls of interferometric transient search by facilitating sensitive, wide-field, and near-real-time radio surveys and enabling a systematic exploration of the dynamic radio sky. This thesis aims at carrying out blind Jansky VLA surveys for characterizing the radio variable and transient sources at frequencies of a few GHz and on timescales between days and years. Through joint radio and optical surveys, the thesis addresses outstanding questions pertaining to the rates of <b>slow</b> radio <b>transients</b> (e. g. radio supernovae, tidal disruption events, binary neutron star mergers, stellar flares, etc.), the false-positive foreground relevant for the radio and optical counterpart searches of gravitational wave sources, and the beaming factor of gamma-ray bursts.

The proposed converter and its control {{is designed to be}} compatible to a fuel cell power source, which exhibits 2 : 1 voltage variation as well as a <b>slow</b> <b>transient</b> response. The proposed approach consists of two stages: a primary three-level boost converter stage cascaded with a high frequency, isolated boost converter topology, which provides a higher voltage gain and isolation from the input source. The function of the first boost converter stage is to maintain a constant voltage at the input of the cascaded DC-DC converter to ensure optimal performance characteristics with high efficiency. At the output of the first boost converter a battery or ultracapacitor energy storage is connected {{to take care of the}} fuel cell <b>slow</b> <b>transient</b> response (200 watts/min).

Thirteen showed loss of alpha activity as the dominant rhythm and half had <b>slow</b> wave <b>transient</b> activity in the temporal lobe areas. This <b>slow</b> wave <b>transient</b> activity correlated with a clinical history of loss of consciousness. The patients with Alzheimer's disease were less likely to show <b>transient</b> <b>slow</b> waves and tended to have less marked slowing of dominant rhythm.  CONCLUSIONS—The greater slowing of the EEG in DLB than in Alzheimer's disease may be related to a greater loss of choline acetyltransferase found in DLB. Temporal <b>slow</b> wave <b>transients</b> may be a useful diagnostic feature in DLB and may help to explain the transient disturbance of consciousness which is characteristic of the disorder. ...|$|R

40|$|Capable of {{reaching}} similar magnitudes to large megathrust earthquakes ($M_w> 7 $), slow slip events {{play a major}} role in accommodating tectonic motion on plate boundaries. These slip <b>transients</b> are the <b>slow</b> release of built-up tectonic stress that are geodetically imaged as a predominantly aseismic rupture, which is smooth in both time and space. We demonstrate here that large slow slip events are in fact a cluster of short-duration <b>slow</b> <b>transients.</b> Using a dense catalog of low-frequency earthquakes as a guide, we investigate the $M_w 7. 5 $ slow slip event that occurred in 2006 along the subduction interface 40 ~km beneath Guerrero, Mexico. We show that while the long-period surface displacement as recorded by GPS suggests a six month duration, motion in the direction of tectonic release only sporadically occurs over 55 days and its surface signature is attenuated by rapid relocking of the plate interface. These results demonstrate that our current conceptual model of slow and continuous rupture is an artifact of low-resolution geodetic observations of a superposition of small, clustered slip events. Our proposed description of slow slip as a cluster of <b>slow</b> <b>transients</b> implies that we systematically overestimate the duration $T$ and underestimate the moment magnitude $M$ of large slow slip events.

40|$|First-passage {{times in}} random walks have {{a vast number}} of diverse {{applications}} in physics, chemistry, biology, and finance. In general, environmental conditions for a stochastic process are not constant on the time scale of the average first-passage time, or control might be applied to reduce noise. We investigate moments of the first-passage time distribution under a transient describing relaxation of environmental conditions. We solve the Laplace-transformed (generalized) master equation analytically using a novel method that is applicable to general state schemes. The first-passage time {{from one end to the}} other of a linear chain of states is our application for the solutions. The dependence of its average on the relaxation rate obeys a power law for <b>slow</b> <b>transients.</b> The exponent ν depends on the chain length N like ν=-N/(N+ 1) to leading order. <b>Slow</b> <b>transients</b> substantially reduce the noise of first-passage times expressed as the coefficient of variation (CV), even if the average first-passage time is much longer than the transient. The CV has a pronounced minimum for some lengths, which we call resonant lengths.

40|$|For fully-developed {{two-phase}} flows, {{maps that}} correlate experimental and semi-empirical expressions for flow regimes are widely used. For calculations {{of the various}} important two-phase flow parameters, this in turn requires correlations for various interfacial and wall interaction effects that are flow regime dependent. For many systems of practical interest, however, the evolution of flow regimes (such as slug flow in oil-gas pipelines) is of interest because the development lengths are long and flow regimes may change in regions where pipeline inclination changes due to the terrain. It is shown here that for <b>slow</b> <b>transients</b> in near-horizontal pipes, the one-dimensional multi-field model, when solved with sufficient resolution, does not require flow regimes to be specified or flow regime dependent closure relationships. The formulation predicts the development of flow regimes and various flow parameters {{without the need for}} maps, or the need to change closure relationships. To accomplish this, the model includes four fields, i. e. continuous and dispersed liquid, continuous and dispersed gas, as well as a set of appropriate closure relationships from the literature. For the main application considered here, i. e. <b>slow</b> <b>transients</b> in oil-gas pipelines, order of magnitude analyses indicate that certain inertial terms in the model are very small and can be neglected in comparison to the others. Advantage is taken of this to simplify both the structure of the mathematical problem and the solution procedure, which is sufficiently accurate that mass is conserved {{for each of the four}} fields. Furthermore, the calculations require high spatial resolution, so a fast, easily-parallelizable numerical procedure has been applied. The results indicate that the development of certain flow regimes, including transitions from bubbly to stratified flow and vice versa, slug flow including slug frequency and length, and the evolution of these parameters along a pipeline are well predicted by the model when compared to experimental data. As part of the validation it is also shown that the model predicts, without need to change closure relationships, flow regimes in fully-developed near-horizontal two-phase flows in good agreement with existing flow regime maps. This suggests that for <b>slow</b> <b>transients</b> in flows for which one-dimensional effects dominate, predictions can be made without requirements for flow regime maps and closure relationships that depend on them.
