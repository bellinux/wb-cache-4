5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{wildlife}} {{can be found in}} and around San Antonio Bay. According to Texas Parks and Wildlife, the following fish have been caught in the bay: palmetto bass, <b>striped</b> <b>bass,</b> hardhead catfish, black drum, red drum, crevalle jack, southern kingfish, ladyfish, lefteye flounder, pinfish, spotted seatrout, and the sheepshead.|$|E
5|$|Several {{antibiotics}} {{have been}} used successfully to treat S.iniae infection in fish. Enrofloxacin, a quinolone antibiotic, {{has been used to}} great effect in hybrid <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> (Morone chrysops√ó M.saxatilis), although evidence suggested the development of a resistant strain. Amoxicillin, erythromycin, furazolidone, and oxytetracycline have also been used (the last with varying success, only in barramundi). Vaccination against S.iniae has been attempted with limited success as it only provides up to 6 months' immunity.|$|E
5|$|Stocking of {{the lake}} with fish began before the {{reservoir}} was filled, with a small rearing pond being placed {{on the bottom of}} the valley. The lake has several species of freshwater fish; largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, bluegill, crappie, rainbow trout, <b>striped</b> <b>bass,</b> channel catfish, and shad. It is considered one of the best fisheries in California.|$|E
5|$|Before the New Waddell Dam was constructed, {{two phases}} of a {{three-phase}} study {{were carried out}} {{to determine the effects}} of the dam on fisheries. Completed in 2005, the third phase of the study determined that the larger reservoir has less nutrient concentrations due to CAP water introduction and that water fluctuations have reduced fish cover, likely affecting food and spawning. Large mouth bass populations have also declined but <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> have entered the lake, likely by eggs transferred through CAP water. Around the lake, Reclamation has taken steps to protect wildlife habitats, including those for bald eagles and Gila topminnows.|$|E
5|$|Some teleosts are migratory; certain {{freshwater}} species move within river {{systems on}} an annual basis; other species are anadromous, spending their lives at sea and moving inland to spawn, salmon and <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> being examples. Others, exemplified by the eel, are catadromous, doing the reverse. The fresh water European eel migrates across the Atlantic Ocean as an adult to breed in floating seaweed in the Sargasso Sea. The adults spawn here and then die, but the developing young are swept by the Gulf Stream towards Europe. By the time they arrive, they are small fish and enter estuaries and ascend rivers, overcoming obstacles in their path to reach the streams and ponds where they spend their adult lives.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E
5|$|Mammals include white-tailed deer, black bear, beaver, bobcat, coyote, raccoon, skunk, groundhog, Virginia opossum, gray fox, red fox, {{and eastern}} cottontail rabbit. Other mammals include: nutria, fox squirrel, gray squirrel, flying squirrel, chipmunk, brown bat, and weasel. Birds include {{cardinals}} (the state bird), barred owls, Carolina chickadees, red-tailed hawks, ospreys, brown pelicans, quail, seagulls, bald eagles, and wild turkeys. Virginia {{is also home}} to the pileated woodpecker as well as the red-bellied woodpecker. The peregrine falcon was reintroduced into Shenandoah National Park in the mid-1990s. Walleye, brook trout, Roanoke bass, and blue catfish are among the 210 known species of freshwater fish. Running brooks with rocky bottoms are often inhabited by plentiful amounts of crayfish and salamanders. The Chesapeake Bay is host to many species, including blue crabs, clams, oysters, and rockfish (also known as <b>striped</b> <b>bass).</b>|$|E
5|$|The main stem of Darby Creek is {{designed}} as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from its source to the Pennsylvania Route 3 bridge. From that point downstream to its mouth, the non-tidal portions of the creek's main stem are a Trout Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Numerous fish species were observed in the creek during a 2009 electrofishing survey by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for smallmouth bass was slightly over 10 and the rate for rock bass was under 10. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for redbreast sunfish was 123, the highest of several warmwater streams tested during the survey. Some stocked rainbow trout and brown trout were also captured in the creek. High numbers of American eels were observed in the creek was well. Fish species such as mummichogs, silvery minnows, <b>striped</b> <b>bass,</b> and white perch were found at the head-of-tide of the creek. Brown trout naturally reproduce in the creek's headwaters.|$|E
5|$|There are 26 {{species of}} native and {{introduced}} {{fish in the}} lower Central Valley portion of the river, including Sacramento sucker, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass and carp. Anadromous fish species found in the lower river are chinook salmon, Pacific lamprey and <b>striped</b> <b>bass.</b> The upper section of the river, defined as the stretch from Lake McClure to the headwaters, has 11 species of fish. Historically, the range of anadromous fish extended to the waterfalls {{at the head of}} Yosemite Valley, but dams have blocked their migration since the early 1900s, and diversions frequently dewater their remaining spawning habitat in {{the lower part of the}} river. Environmental measures enacted in the late 20th century have had some success in boosting chinook salmon populations, from a record low of 500 fish during several years in the 1950s, to a high of 30,000 in 1984. Since the 1970s, the annual chinook run has averaged about 5,300.|$|E
25|$|<b>Striped</b> <b>bass</b> has {{firm and}} flavorful flesh {{with a large}} flake. The hybrid <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> yields more meat, has a more fragile texture, and a blander flavor than wild <b>striped</b> <b>bass.</b> The fish has a mild and {{distinctive}} flavor. In recipes, it can be substituted for milder fish like cod, {{as well as for}} stronger fish like bluefish. Other fish can substitute it, including weakfish, tilefish, blackfish, small bluefish, catfish, salmon, swordfish, and shark. <b>Striped</b> <b>bass</b> is easily grilled in fillets, and is therefore popular in beach communities.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{biologists}} came {{to believe}} that <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> stayed in rivers for long periods of time, with some not returning to sea unless temperature changes forced migration. Once fishermen and biologists caught on to rising <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> populations, many state natural resources departments started stocking <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> in local lakes. <b>Striped</b> <b>bass</b> still continue to exhibit upstream migrations from freshwater lakes during the spawning period. Landlocked stripers have a hard time reproducing naturally, {{and one of the few}} and most successful rivers they have been documented reproducing successfully is the Coosa River in Alabama and Georgia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Striped</b> <b>bass</b> {{have also}} been hybridized with white bass to produce hybrid <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> also known as wiper, whiterock bass, {{sunshine}} bass, palmetto bass, and Cherokee bass. These hybrids have been stocked in many freshwater areas across the US.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> was {{designated}} as a protected game fish in 2007, and executive agencies were directed to use existing legal authorities to prohibit the sale of <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> caught in federal waters in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> fishery in North America {{dates back to the}} Colonial period. Many written {{accounts}} by some of the first European settlers describe the immense abundance of <b>striped</b> <b>bass,</b> along with alewives, traveling and spawning up most rivers in the coastal Northeast.|$|E
25|$|The main piscivore of the LSZ is the <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> (Morone saxatilis), {{which was}} {{introduced}} in the 1890s and preys heavily upon native fishes. <b>Striped</b> <b>bass</b> are an important sport fishery in the San Francisco Estuary, and as such, represent a minor withdrawal of biomass from the estuary.|$|E
25|$|Cape Cod {{is known}} {{around the world}} as a spring-to-fall {{destination}} for sport anglers. Among the species most widely pursued are <b>striped</b> <b>bass,</b> bluefish, bluefin tuna, false albacore (little tunny), bonito, tautog, flounder and fluke. The Cape Cod Bay side of the Cape, from Sandwich to Provincetown, has numerous harbors, saltwater creeks, and shoals that hold bait fish and attract the larger game fish, such as <b>striped</b> <b>bass,</b> bluefish and bluefin tuna.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the only}} {{landlocked}} <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> populations in Canada {{is located in the}} Grand Lake, Nova Scotia. They migrate out in early April into the Shubenacadie River to spawn. These bass also spawn in the Stewiacke River (a tributary of the Shubenacadie). The Shubenacadie River system is one of five known spawning areas in Canada for <b>striped</b> <b>bass,</b> with the others being the St. Lawerence River, Miramichi River, Saint John River, Annapolis River and Shubenacadie/Stewiacke Rivers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Striped</b> <b>bass</b> {{have also}} been {{introduced}} into waters in Ecuador, Iran, Latvia, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey, primarily for sport fishing and aquaculture.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{population}} of <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> was growing and repopulating in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, a study executed by the Wildlife and Fisheries Program at West Virginia University found that {{the rapid growth of}} the <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> population was exerting a tremendous pressure on its prey (river herring, shad, and blueback herring). This pressure on their food source was putting their own population at risk due to {{the population}} of prey naturally not coming back to the same spawning areas.|$|E
25|$|In the Mid-Atlantic regions, Saint Joseph's Day is {{traditionally}} {{associated with the}} return of anadromous fish, such as <b>striped</b> <b>bass,</b> to their natal rivers, such as the Delaware.|$|E
25|$|According to the NYSDEC Hudson River Estuary Program, about 220 {{species of}} fish, {{including}} 173 native species, currently {{are found in}} the Hudson River. These include <b>striped</b> <b>bass,</b> the most important game fish in the Hudson. Estimates of the <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> population in the Hudson range to nearly 100 million fish. American eels also live in the river before reaching breeding age; for much of this stage they are known as glass eels because of the transparency of their bodies. The fish are the only catadromous species in the Hudson's estuary.|$|E
25|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> is {{the state}} fish of Maryland, Rhode Island, and South Carolina, and the state {{saltwater}} (marine) fish of New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and New Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|Beltzville Lake is {{a popular}} fishing destination. Anglers can fish for <b>striped</b> <b>bass,</b> largemouth and smallmouth bass, trout, walleye, perch, and muskellunge. Pohopoco Creek is stocked with trout by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission.|$|E
25|$|Predators of herring include seabirds, {{marine mammals}} such as dolphins, porpoises, whales, seals, and sea lions, predatory fish such as sharks, billfish, tuna, salmon, <b>striped</b> <b>bass,</b> cod, and halibut. Fishermen also catch and eat herring.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, the {{province}} of Quebec designated the <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> population of the Saint Lawrence as extirpated in 1996. Analysis of available data implicated overfishing and dredging in the disappearance. In 2002, a reintroduction program was successful.|$|E
25|$|The largest <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> {{ever taken}} by angling was an 81.88-lb (37.14-kg) {{specimen}} {{taken from a}} boat in Long Island Sound, near the Outer Southwest Reef, {{off the coast of}} Westbrook, Connecticut. The all-tackle world record fish was taken by Gregory Myerson on the night of August 4, 2011. The fish took a drifted live eel bait, and fought for 20 minutes before being boated by Myerson. A second hook and leader was discovered in the fish's mouth when it was boated, indicating it had been previously hooked by another angler. The fish measured 54in length and had a girth of 36in. The International Game Fish Association declared Myerson's catch the new all-tackle world record <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> on October 19, 2011. In addition to now holding the All-Tackle record, Meyerson's catch also landed him the new IGFA men‚Äôs 37-kg (80-lb) line class record for <b>striped</b> <b>bass,</b> which previously stood at 70lb. The previous all-tackle world record fish was a 78.5-lb (35.6-kg) specimen taken in Atlantic City, New Jersey on September 21, 1982 by Albert McReynolds, who fought the fish from the beach for 1:20 after it took his Rebel artificial lure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Striped</b> <b>bass</b> {{are native}} to the Atlantic {{coastline}} of North America from the St. Lawrence River into the Gulf of Mexico to approximately Louisiana. They are anadromous fish that migrate between fresh and salt water. Spawning takes place in fresh water.|$|E
25|$|Oregon IIs {{projects}} include {{summer and}} autumn groundfish surveys, summer shark longline surveys, and surveys of ichthyoplankton, marine mammals, and reef fish. She annually supports a <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> survey and tagging effort by NMFSs Beaufort Laboratory in Beaufort, North Carolina.|$|E
25|$|<b>Striped</b> <b>bass</b> has {{white meat}} {{with a mild}} flavor and a medium texture. It is {{extremely}} versatile in {{that it can be}} pan-seared, grilled, steamed, poached, roasted, broiled, saut√©ed, and deep fried (including batter-frying). The flesh can also be eaten raw or pickled.|$|E
25|$|The creek's estuary {{below the}} dam at Saugerties {{has also become}} a popular spot for bass fishing. Several tournaments are held for both largemouth and smallmouths. <b>Striped</b> <b>bass</b> from the Hudson also spawn in the estuarine Esopus, making it a popular spot for them as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{spawning}} {{success of}} <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> {{has been studied}} in the San Francisco Bay-Delta water system, with a finding that high total dissolved solids (TDS) reduce spawning. At levels as low as 200mg/l TDS, an observable diminution of spawning productivity occurs. They {{can be found in}} lakes, ponds, streams, and wetlands.|$|E
25|$|The Bay {{is famous}} for its rockfish, a {{regional}} name for <b>striped</b> <b>bass.</b> Once on the verge of extinction, rockfish have made a significant comeback because of legislative action that put a moratorium on rockfishing, which allowed the species to re-populate. Rockfish can now be fished in strictly controlled and limited quantities.|$|E
25|$|Forage {{fish are}} {{the food that}} sustains larger {{predator}}s above them in the ocean food chain. The superabundance they present in their schools make them ideal food sources for top predator fish such as tuna, <b>striped</b> <b>bass,</b> cod, salmon, barracuda and swordfish, as well as sharks, whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, sea lions, and seabirds.|$|E
25|$|During her career, Chapman dredged for {{scallops}} and trawled for cod off {{the coast}} of New England, and conducted winter tagging of <b>striped</b> <b>bass</b> off the Outer Banks of North Carolina. She also made physical oceanographic measurements and plankton collections in the Gulf Stream and the Loop Current, collected red tide organisms, and observed marine mammals.|$|E
25|$|The Delaware River and the Delaware Canal {{are warm}} water fisheries. Common game fish include the American shad, <b>striped</b> <b>bass,</b> walleye and smallmouth bass. The river is also popular {{with people who}} wish to explore it in canoes and other small non-powered watercraft. All boats must have a launch permit for Pennsylvania or New Jersey or a current {{registration}} from any state.|$|E
25|$|Maryland {{has a large}} food-production sector. A large {{component}} of this is commercial fishing, centered in the Chesapeake Bay, but also including activity off the short Atlantic seacoast. The largest catches by species are the blue crab, oysters, <b>striped</b> <b>bass,</b> and menhaden. The Bay also has overwintering waterfowl in its wildlife refuges. The waterfowl support a tourism sector of sportsmen.|$|E
