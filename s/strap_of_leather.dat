5000|$|On a {{finished}} horse, a bosal with a properly balanced heel knot and mecate generally {{does not require}} additional support beyond the headstall. If needed, however, additional support can be provided by one or two accessories. The first is a throatlatch known as a fiador. If a fiador is used, a browband is added to hold the fiador to the headstall. [...] Less often, the bosal may be further supported by attaching the nose button to the horse's forelock or the crownpiece of the headstall, using a single thin <b>strap</b> <b>of</b> <b>leather</b> called a forelock hanger.|$|E
50|$|On riding horses, it is {{most helpful}} on horses with large {{shoulders}} and a flat ribcage. It is also a safety feature, especially on cross-country, should a rider's girth or billets break, as she will {{have enough time to}} stop the horse and dismount before the saddle slipped off the animal's back or underneath its belly. The breastplate is used on both English and Western saddles. When used in English riding, the hunting breastplate is made <b>of</b> thinner <b>straps</b> <b>of</b> <b>leather,</b> as is the western style used for horse shows.

Zeke, being the owner of a pair of huge, dilapidated boots, hanging from a rafter like saddlebags, the doctor succeeded in exchanging for them a case-knife, the last valuable article in his possession.

6000|$|The {{night was}} fine and frosty, though, when I pretended {{to see what}} its {{character}} was, it might have rained like the deluge.

In the best days of my life, when I won one or two hard walking matches, I doubt if I ever walked so fast as I did betwixt the Treddles Arms and the borough town for which I was bound.

5000|$|The cinch {{attaches}} to the saddle {{by means of a}} latigo on either side. The latigo is a wide, flexible <b>strap,</b> usually <b>of</b> <b>leather,</b> though nylon webbing is also seen.

The latigo on the near (left) side is attached to the saddle at all times, but the loose end is used to secure the saddle for riding by running it through the left cinch ring one or more times, back through the saddle's dee ring, and then finally buckled or knotted when tight. It is loosened and removed from the cinch to take off the saddle.|$|R
50|$|It {{is roughly}} square in cross-section, with the {{keyboards}} consisting of cylindrical buttons on each end arranged in curving rows. Like other concertinas, the buttons travel {{in a direction}} approximately parallel to {{the motion of the}} bellows, whereas the keys and buttons of an accordion move roughly perpendicular to the motion of the bellows. A <b>strap,</b> usually <b>of</b> <b>leather,</b> is fitted at each end to hold the player's palm against the instrument for playing. Compare to the English concertina where the thumb holds a strap, the little finger is held on a rest, and the remaining three fingers press the keys. The instrument is bisonoric, meaning that each button corresponds to two notes: one when the bellows is compressed, and another when it is expanded. On most instruments, two or more (and as many as five) reeds sound for each note. The tones produced are either in octaves, unison, or in some combination thereof.|$|R
