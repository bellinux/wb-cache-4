40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to analyse two Estonian {{databases}} – the Succession Register and the notices of <b>succession</b> <b>proceedings</b> (Pärimisteated) in the public electronic publication Official Announcements – and compare the goals set for the Estonian Succession Register to those set for other registers of wills in EU member states in order to suggest some proposals for future development. The Estonian register of wills (the Succession Register) was established on 1 October 1996 under the first Estonian Succession Law Act, which also provided for the publishing of notices of <b>succession</b> <b>proceedings,</b> an operation that started on 1 January 1997. <b>Succession</b> <b>proceedings</b> conducted by Estonian notaries are readily accessible and observable by all interested persons through the Succession Register and the electronic database of notices of <b>succession</b> <b>proceedings</b> published in Official Announcements. From the data available in the Succession Register, {{it is possible to}} obtain complete information about the succession proceedings: not only data about the testaments and succession contracts entered in it but also information about which notary is conducting the <b>succession</b> <b>proceedings</b> for any given deceased person, information about estate-management measures, and succession certificates. Everyone, including those persons entitled to inherit and the creditors of the deceased, has since the end of 2013 had access to information about the initiation of <b>succession</b> <b>proceedings</b> and about the notary conducting them, just as much as about the general state of <b>succession</b> <b>proceedings,</b> directly through the Succession Register data from the e-state portal. The Estonian Succession Register belongs to the European Network of Registers of Wills (ENRW or RERT). The information in the second electronic database, Pärimisteated, can be divided into three types: notices related to the initiation of <b>succession</b> <b>proceedings,</b> notices of the calling proceedings for identification of heirs, and notices of calling proceedings conducted for purposes of determining the obligations incurred by the deceased and applying to the estate...|$|E
40|$|International law of {{succession}} focusing on European regulation The aim of my thesis is the international Law of Succession with emphasis on the European Regulation No. 650 / 2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and acceptance and enforcement of authentic instruments in matters {{of succession}} and {{on the creation of}} a European Certificate on Succession. The regulation of succession will apply to <b>succession</b> <b>proceedings</b> with an international element concerning those who died after 17 August 2015. The purpose of the regulation is to simplify and expedite such proceedings within the European Union. In principle, the ruling on the entire estate of the testator should be decided {{in the course of a}} single succession proceeding in order to avoid conflicts in court judgments that could occur if the procedure was split into different countries. Furthermore, the diploma thesis deals with the concept of border determinant in international law, where habitual residence becomes increasingly important, while other borderline determinants such as domicile or nationality already lose their importance. I also explain the term 'estate planning' in my paper, i. e. the arrangement of inheritance conditions of the future [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the Regulation (EU) No 650 / 2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on jurisdiction, {{applicable}} law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and acceptance and enforcement of authentic instruments in matters of succession and {{on the creation of}} a European Certificate of Succession (regulation on succession). This regulation will be applicable in the matters of successions with cross-border implications of people who will decease on 17 August 2015 or later. Regulation on succession unifies legislation in matters of succession with cross-border implications, both in terms of substantive law and procedural law. This regulation has been expected {{for a long time in}} the European Union because the succession matters were expressly excluded from the scope of other regulations. Also thanks to the free movement of persons, the unification of this area of law is becoming more necessary from day to day. The preparation of this regulation and the connected discussions lasted several years. Not only for the numerous differences between the national rules of the Member States but also for the intention to create a complete unification of the substantive law, the <b>succession</b> <b>proceedings</b> itself and of the recognition, enforceability and enforcement of decisions. In [...] ...|$|E
60|$|This hopeful {{beginning}} was followed up by a <b>succession</b> of <b>proceedings</b> {{which should be}} recorded for the instruction of all who seek for help from the race of boys. Such a loser of all tools, great and small; such an invariable leaver-open of all gates, and letter-down of bars; such a personification of all manner of anarchy and ill luck, {{had never before been}} seen on the estate. His time, while I was gone to the city, was agreeably diversified with roosting on the fence, swinging on the gates, making poplar whistles for the children, hunting eggs, and eating whatever fruit happened to be in season, in which latter accomplishment he was certainly quite distinguished. After about three weeks of this kind of joint gardening, we concluded to dismiss Master Tom from the firm, and employ a man.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{capacity}} as Chancellor of Saxony, we now {{find him in}} {{the proceedings of the}} Elector again from 1529. Furthermore as the Chancellor of Saxony he performed the on 25 June 1530 in the afternoon from 3 until 5 o'clock Diet of Augsburg to Emperor Charles V and the other Electors of the Holy Roman Empire with the German edition of [...] "Augsburg Confession", as skilfully developed by Philipp Melanchthon. The session was held in the chapter-hall of the Episcopal Palace. He read it aloud and was widely heard, so that the crowd, which stood close together in the outside courtyard, could understand word for word of the speech through the open window. This is the first official and until now has remained firm commitment of the Evangelical Lutheran Church.In 1532 of his chancellery phase, he served in the <b>succession</b> homage <b>proceedings</b> of John, Elector of Saxony in the city of Gotha, as when he also was at the convention in Brunswick to confirm the formal council authority of the town Buttelstädt. In 1533 he was invested as witness to the dispute regarding the Elector's financial credit given to Wolffen, Count of Barby, and the Castle and township of Barby and it's signed “Privileges of Werdau”.In 1534 he was in the then Upper Kranichfeld (today Kranichfeld), where he exhibited the Credit documents.|$|R
40|$|Resumé <b>Succession</b> <b>proceedings</b> As a {{theme of}} my thesis, I chose "The probate process". The reason for this emerged from my {{practice}} in a notary's office during my studies. After graduation, I plan on working further as a notary clerk. [...] The paper is divided into five primary chapters. The first chapter is introductory, describing why I decided {{to work on this}} topic, how the dissertation is divided and what is according to my opinion its main asset. [...] - The second chapter, called "the historical evolution", deals with the development of notary and its authorities over Czech lands from the 12 th century until present days. This chapter consists of four parts. The first one focuses on the development from the 12 th century until the foundation the First Republic. The chapter continues with part number two, which explores the era from 1918 to 1948. The third part then explains changes in legislative, as after 1948 many acts were adopted, which had changed the whole notary organization and notary had been step-by-step nationalized. The last section of this chapter, the era after 1993, is focused on changes due to notary privatization. [...] - [...] The third chapter characterizes the inheritance [...] ...|$|E
