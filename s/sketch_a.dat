5|$|At George Washington University, a {{group of}} artists <b>sketch</b> <b>a</b> nude male model. However, one of the artists, John Mostow (Levani Outchaneichvili), draws a demonic {{creature}} in the model's place; while using a utility knife to sharpen his pencil he cuts his hand trying and smears the blood on his drawing. When the model reaches his car after the session, he is attacked and killed by an obscured assailant. The following morning, Mostow is arrested in his apartment by an FBI task force led by Agent Bill Patterson (Kurtwood Smith), who finds the utility knife used in the murder covered in blood.|$|E
5|$|The New Yorker {{film critic}} Anthony Lane wrote that Belushi was {{flawless}} and captured Shatner's essence while adding simultaneously his own layer of weariness to the character. The Hollywood Reporter interviewed Tom Hanks and Elliott Gould in 2015; Gould called the <b>sketch</b> <b>a</b> favorite, while Hanks placed {{it among the}} best five of all time. In ranking every single Saturday Night Live cast member by talent in 2015, Rolling Stone called the Captain Kirk parody one of Belushi's most memorable and wrote that it was evidence of the actor's youthful innocence.|$|E

5|$|While on the trip, he did <b>sketch</b> <b>a</b> line {{of walking}} wounded, and some prisoners {{making their way}} to the rear from an early morning offensive. This became the basis of the {{painting}} The Harvest of Battle which was the largest single work Nevinson painted. It was completed in February 1919 and Nevinson arranged a 'private view' of the painting in his studio on 2 April for numerous critics and journalists. Whilst this produced some favourable reviews, notably in the Daily Express, it also led to articles claiming that the painting was so grim that it was being withheld from the public. When the painting was shown at the huge The Nation's War Paintings and Drawings exhibition organised by the Imperial War Museum in December 1919 at Burlington House Nevinson was furious to find it had not been hung in the main room but rather in a side gallery. He began a campaign of vilification against all those he held responsible for this insult. Unreasonable as Nevinsons' outrage was it did have consequences; it destroyed his friendship with Muirhead Bone, who had been on the organising committee for the exhibition, made the Imperial War Museum wary of dealing with him, and blinded Nevinson himself to the high esteem in which his war paintings were held.|$|E

25|$|In {{a number}} of his short stories and sketches, Caragiale makes use of another {{particularly}} Junimist theme, and investigates the glamorous but superficial impact of modernization on high society.

40|$|A sketch-based {{interface}} {{within an}} animation engine provides an end-user with tools for creating emitter textures and oscillator textures. The end-user may create an emitter texture by sketching {{one or more}} patch elements and then <b>sketching</b> <b>an</b> emitter. The animation engine animates the <b>sketch</b> by generating <b>a</b> stream of patch elements that emanate from the emitter. The end-user may create an oscillator texture by <b>sketching</b> <b>a</b> patch that includes one or more patch elements, and then <b>sketching</b> <b>a</b> brush skeleton and an oscillation skeleton. The animation engine replicates the patch along the brush skeleton, and then interpolates the replicated patches between the brush skeleton and the oscillation skeleton, thereby causing those replicated patches to periodically oscillate between the two skeletons...|$|R
25|$|On {{the eve of}} the First World War there {{appeared}} a small, practical booklet composed by Captain (later Colonel) Léopold-Victor Justinard (1878–1959), entitled Manuel de berbère marocain (dialecte chleuh). It contains a short grammatical <b>sketch,</b> <b>a</b> collection of stories, poems and songs, and some interesting dialogues, all with translations. The work was written while the author was overseeing military operations in the region of Fès, shortly after the imposition of the French protectorate (1912).

25|$|Upon {{completion}} of the Merritt, George Dunkelberger, the designer of all sixty-nine original bridges, was asked to <b>sketch</b> <b>a</b> bird's-eye view of a Parkway scene he particularly enjoyed. He chose the Park Avenue Underpass in Trumbull with the Sport Hill Road Underpass and Morehouse Highway Underpass in the distance. The sketch, with Park Avenue as a focal point, was used {{on the cover of}} the 1940 Highway Commissioner's Biennial Report. The Park Avenue Underpass was also used to symbolize the Parkway on the state of Connecticut's Anniversary Plate issued in 1943.|$|E
25|$|Robert Chambers {{became a}} {{prominent}} suspect {{as early as}} the spring of 1845. In 1854, following the publication of the 10th edition of Vestiges along with its anonymous biographical <b>sketch,</b> <b>a</b> former assistant named David Page accused Chambers directly. The accusation was printed in the Athenaeum, but because Page was an embittered former employee of the Chambers's firm, his testimony was not taken very seriously. Vyvyan finally denied that he was the author outright and the British Museum listed the book under George Combe's name as late as 1877.|$|E
