In an interview with The Daily Caller he <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> candidates [...] "don't understand what's wrong with the economy, let alone how to fix it", and that foreign policy was not being discussed enough. He observed that since former United Nations ambassador John R. Bolton announced he would not run for president, foreign policy discussion had ceased. [...] McCotter hoped the next president would select Bolton as Secretary of State.|$|E
500|$|Filming of {{the trap}} scenes, which was done last, began in March. The film's opening trap scene was filmed at Metro Hall in Toronto, Ontario, just outside Roy Thomson Hall, and {{included}} 400 extras. [...] In the trap, the circular saw blades were actually real and functional, but safety precautions were taken for the actors. One actor {{that was in}} the trap, Jon Cor, told Demon FM that he had scars on his hands from the shackles, and <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> actors, Sebastian Pigott chipped his tooth and Anne Lee Greene lost the feeling in her feet and had to receive medical attention.|$|E
500|$|Despite Vanderbilt's strong record, the Sewanee Tigers were undefeated {{and felt}} cause for {{optimism}} in the effective Southern championship. One account recalls: [...] "A high authority on foot-ball <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> day: Vanderbilt is not invincible, {{by a good}} deal. The Sewanee [...] "Tigers" [...] are going to Nashville on Thursday to prove that fact." [...] Vanderbilt struggled, but still won 20–0. [...] "With Vandy making only 20 points–Vandy was stale, was the explanation." [...] After the big win over Carlisle, [...] "a matter-of-course feeling pervaded the entire game." [...] The first score of the game came on a 25-yard field goal. The first touchdown came from Owsley Manier. In the second half, Bob Blake made a 22-yard field goal, and Manier got another touchdown.|$|E

500|$|In a 1994 {{interview}} for The Beatles Anthology, however, McCartney disagreed with Lennon's recollections, recalling {{that it was}} the Beatles, and not Lester, who had come {{up with the idea of}} using Starr's verbal misstep: [...] "The title was Ringo's. We'd almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we'd not known about before, which was naming the film. So we were sitting around at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session ... and we said, 'Well, there was something Ringo <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> day.' Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they were sort of magic even though he was just getting it wrong. And he said after a concert, 'Phew, it's been a hard day's night.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Houston Chronicle critic Joey Guerra {{gave the}} album two-and-a-half {{out of four}} stars and was underwhelmed with the {{production}} for sounding like his previous recordings. He recognized that Miguel was capable of handling love songs because of his [...] "rich, deep voice" [...] highlighting [...] "Tu Mirada", [...] "Soy Yo", and [...] "O Tú o Ninguna" [...] as examples. However, Guerra felt that Miguel [...] "runs into trouble" [...] on the dance tracks as he did on his prior albums. He chided [...] "Sol, Arena y Mar" [...] for its [...] "tepid mix of blaring horns and uninspired lyrics" [...] and <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> uptempo songs [...] "don't fare any better"; he criticized the over usage of horns on every fast-paced track as [...] "dated" [...] and [...] "repetitive". Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News wrote a more positive review of the album. He complimented [...] "Te Propongo Esta Noche" [...] and lauded the ballads such as [...] "Dormir Contigo" [...] and [...] "Ese Momento" [...] as [...] "sensual and solemn". Tarradell closed his review by calling Amartes Es un Placer an [...] "enjoyable balance between high-brow ballads and hardwood workouts". Miami Herald editor Leila Cobo was disappointed with the record. She noted that while Miguel's vocals are still [...] "dazzling", the production sounds [...] "dated". She found [...] "Tú, Sólo Tú" [...] and [...] "Dímelo en un Beso" [...] to be [...] "discoish duds that lack the oomph to get you on the dance floor". Cobo also commented the tracks suffer {{from a lack of}} [...] "strong hooks or melodies" [...] despite Miguel having the ability to [...] "elevate pretty much any style". Even so, Cobo praised [...] "Dormir Contigo" [...] for its [...] "few memorable lyrics" [...] and [...] "No Me Fío" [...] for its arrangements.|$|E
2500|$|Schwahn stated of the {{basketball}} element, [...] "A lot of times, {{the basketball}} games for us are like the crimes, or it's the courtroom, the police precinct, or the medical operating arena – it was like our home turf." [...] He <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> shows rarely focus on the court case or medical problem being dealt with, but are more about the people. [...] "For us, that's what basketball was. It was never about playing basketball, but it was {{about what was happening}} to the people when this game or tournament was approaching." ...|$|E

5000|$|A story {{passed on}} {{by word of}} mouth showing {{friendly}} banter between villagers that lived on the two rivers is that the people on <b>the</b> Weisse Lütschine <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> [...] "were so dirty it turned the river black" [...] and the villagers on the Schwarze Lütschine claimed <b>the</b> <b>others</b> [...] "never even washed so <b>the</b> <b>other</b> tributary remained perfectly white".|$|R

Yzerman also said, [...] "If we wanted to we could have kept them on this team. They're better off playing a lot of minutes in the American Hockey League." [...] On the same day, Lightning head coach Jon Cooper announced that Ryan Callahan will wear a permanent [...] "A" [...] as an alternate captain this season.

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the large growth of the church, their bylaws, which {{outlined}} how the church was organised, were rewritten more than once. The outcome of this process led to changes in leadership organization in November 2007. The new bylaws installed lead pastor Jamie Munson, preaching pastor Mark Driscoll, and pastors Scott Thomas and Tim Beltz as [...] "executive pastors" [...] who led the objectives of the church [...] "under the authority of the Board of Directors," [...] on which the executive pastors also served as directors. This change precipitated the firing of two pastors. [...] "Mars Hill leaders said in forum postings that one fired pastor was removed, in part, for [...] "displaying an unhealthy distrust in the senior leadership." [...] They <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> was removed for [...] "disregarding the accepted elder protocol for the bylaw deliberation period" [...] and [...] "verbally attacking the lead pastor"— charges the fired pastor denied, the leaders added." ...|$|E
