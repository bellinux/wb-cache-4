40|$|Transient {{increases}} in cytosolic free calcium concentration, [Ca 2 +]i, {{appear to be}} required for the migration of human neutrophils on poly-D- lysine-coated glass {{in the presence of}} dilute serum (Marks, P. W., and F. R. Maxfield. 1990. J. Cell Biol. 110 : 43 - 52). In contrast, no requirement for [Ca 2 +]i transients exists when neutrophils migrate on albumin-coated glass in the absence of serum. To determine the mechanism that necessitates [Ca 2 +]i transients on poly-D-lysine in the presence of serum, migration was examined on substrates consisting of purified adhesive glycoproteins. In the absence of external Ca 2 +, a treatment which causes the cessation of [Ca 2 +]i transients, migration on fibronectin (fn) and vitronectin (vn) was significantly inhibited. Migration was also inhibited in Ca 2 (+) -buffered cells on these substrates, indicating that this effect was the result of an alteration of [Ca 2 +]i. In the absence of external Ca 2 +, the inhibition of migration on fn or vn was more pronounced when soluble fn or vn was added to cells migrating on these substrates. This effect of <b>soluble</b> <b>adhesive</b> glycoprotein was specific: in the absence of external Ca 2 +, soluble fn did not affect the migration of cells on vn, and soluble vn did not affect the migration on fn. No additional inhibition of migration was observed in Ca 2 (+) -buffered cells with the addition of <b>soluble</b> <b>adhesive</b> glycoprotein. These data indicate that [Ca 2 +]i transients are involved in continued migration of human neutrophils on fn or vn, proteins which are part of the extracellular matrix that neutrophils encounter in vivo...|$|E

To investigate whether the mechanism of targeting of P-selectin to granules is specific for megakaryocytes and endothelial cells and/or dependent on von Willebrand factor, a <b>soluble</b> <b>adhesive</b> protein that is stored in the same granules, we have expressed the cDNA for P-selectin in AtT 20 cells.

40|$|The thermal {{imidization}} of {{a number}} of polyimide precursors in the form of powders, films, and prepregs was examined by an in situ diffuse reflectance-FTIR technique where infrared spectra were determined while the material was being heated. An analysis of these spectra revealed that, {{with the exception of one}} water <b>soluble</b> <b>adhesive,</b> each precursor developed an anhydride band around 1850 cm/cu during imidization. This band diminished in intensity during final stages of cure. Efforts were made to quantify the amount of anhydride in several samples. Evidence obtained could be interpreted to mean that poly(amic acid) resins undergo an initial reduction in molecular weight during imidization before recombining to achieve their ultimate molecular weights as polyimides. Several reports in the literature are cited to support this interpretation. This report serves both to document anhydride formation during imidization and to increase our fundamental understanding of how polyimides cure...|$|E

40|$|The ShcA gene {{products}} {{have served as}} a model for the analysis of phosphotyrosine-recognition domains, and for the functions of docking proteins during tyrosine kinase signaling. Here we show that ShcA is primarily expressed in the cardiovascular system during early mouse embryogenesis and regulates both heart development and establishment of mature blood vessels. Targeted mutation suggests that the ShcA adaptor is a pivotal target of tyrosine kinases that selectively potentiates activation of the MAP kinase pathway in the remodeling vasculature. Biochemical analysis of mutant cells shows that ShcA sensitizes cells to growth factor-induced MAP kinase activation, and also organizes cytoskeletal rearrangement in response to the extracellular matrix. ShcA may therefore orchestrate complex interactions within the vascular compartment by rendering cells permissive to respond to <b>soluble</b> and <b>adhesive</b> external cues...|$|R

To {{access the}} role of endothelial {{adhesive}} dysfunction {{in the development of}} atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) complicated by chronic heart failure (CHF). Material and methods. 111 patients with CHF class I–IV due to myocardial ischemia were included in the study. All participants were divided into four groups according to the presence of AF and CHF class. The control group consisted of 25 healthy individuals. Endothelial adhesive function was assessed by levels of <b>soluble</b> intercellular <b>adhesive</b> molecules sVCAM- 1 and sE-selectin. Results. The sVCAM- 1 level in patients with CHF class III–IV with AF was significantly higher than this in control group and patients with CHF class I–II regardless of AF occurrence, as well as higher than this in patients with CHF class III–IV without AF (65 %, 56. 1 %, 36. 3 % and 13. 9 %, respectively, p< 0. 05).

The objective {{of our study}} was to compare markers of systemic inflammation and <b>soluble</b> <b>adhesive</b> molecules in patients undergoing elective hip replacement to those with hip fracture either intracapsular (IC) or extracapsular (EC). DesignWe included 65 consecutive patients undergoing hip surgery – 17 patients with elective hip replacement (EL group), 29 patients with EC fracture (EC group) and 11 patients with IC fracture (IC group). Fibrinogen (FBG), orosomucoid (ORM), C-reactive protein (CRP), transferrin (TRF) and white blood cells count (WBC), sP-selectin, sE-selectin, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (sICAM- 1) were measured before surgery 4 h, 48 h, and 7 days after surgery. ResultsIC patients had preoperatively highest values of inflammatory markers including FBG, CRP, ORM, WBC and lowest values of TRF, as compared to intermediate values found in EC and lowest values in EL groups. The surgery has led in all three subgroups to significant elevation in CRP, ORM and decrease in TRF. In IC group, the subsequent recovery of inflammatory markers was very slow. We noted a significant suppression of sP-selectin and sE-selectin values in all subgroups after surgery. The decrease of sE-selectin but not of sP-selectin correlated with changes in hemoglobin and blood transfusions' administration. ConclusionsHip surgery is associated with significant inflammatory reaction. In patients with hip fractures, inflammatory markers are elevated already preoperatively, more so in IC than in EC fractures. The unexpected observation of a significant postoperative decrease in sE-selectin and sP-selectin will require further research for elucidation...|$|E
40|$|Apart {{from the}} {{paradigm}} that cell–biomaterials interaction {{depends on the}} adsorption of <b>soluble</b> <b>adhesive</b> proteins we anticipate that upon distinct conditions also other, less soluble ECM proteins such as collagens, associate with the biomaterials interface with consequences for cellular response that might be of significant bioengineering interest. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) we seek to follow the nanoscale behavior of adsorbed type IV collagen (Col IV) —a unique multifunctional matrix protein involved {{in the organization of}} basement membranes (BMs) including vascular ones. We have previously shown that substratum wettability significantly affects Col IV adsorption pattern, and in turn alters endothelial cells interaction. Here we introduce two new model surfaces based on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), a positively charged –NH 2, and negatively charged –COOH surface, to learn more about their particular effect on Col IV behavior. AFM studies revealed distinct pattern of Col IV assembly onto the two SAMs resembling different aspects of network-like structure or aggregates (suggesting altered protein conformation). Moreover, the amount of adsorbed FITC-labeled Col IV was quantified and showed about twice more protein on NH 2 substrata. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells attached less efficiently to Col IV adsorbed on negatively charged COOH surface judged by altered cell spreading, focal adhesions formation, and actin cytoskeleton development. Immunofluorescence studies also revealed better Col IV recognition by both α 1 and α 2 integrins on positively charged NH 2 substrata resulting in higher phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase recruitment in the focal adhesion complexes. On COOH surface, no integrin clustering was observed. Taken altogether these results, point to the possibility that combined NH 2 and Col IV functionalization may support endothelization of cardiovascular implants...|$|E
40|$|SummarySrc is a nonreceptor {{tyrosine}} kinase that coordinates responses to diverse <b>soluble</b> and <b>adhesive</b> signaling molecules and regulates cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and migration [1]. Normally, Src activity is tightly regulated, and Src-catalyzed phosphorylation is counterbalanced by phosphotyrosine phosphatases [2, 3]. However, deregulated mutant Src causes malignant transformation when highly expressed [4]. Src transformation is dose dependent, {{but it has}} been unclear how much mutant Src, compared with endogenous Src, is required for transformation [5]. Here, we show that transformation requires high-level overexpression of mutant src mRNA, in part because active Src protein is degraded by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis [6]. We show that active but not inactive Src protein is downregulated depending on the putative tumor suppressor and E 3 ubiquitin ligase component, Cullin- 5 (Cul 5). Cul 5 removal synergizes with physiological levels of mutant src mRNA to increase protein tyrosine phosphorylation, induce morphological transformation, and deregulate growth. Cul 5 also represses Src-induced tumorigenesis and regulates Src signaling in normal cells. These results suggest that, when Src is activated by mutation or physiological mechanisms, its effects are limited by Cul 5, which downregulates active Src and its phosphorylated substrates. These findings demonstrate the importance of a new mechanism that downregulates Src signaling in cells...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Obesity {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} health problems in the canine population. While haemostatic parameters and markers of endothelial function have been evaluated in various disease conditions in dogs, there are no studies of these markers in canine obesity. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of naturally gained weight excess and obesity on inflammatory, hemostatic and endothelial biomarkers in dogs. A total of 37 overweight and obese dogs were compared with 28 normal weight dogs. Results Overweight and obese dogs had significantly elevated concentrations of serum interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Number of platelets, activity of factor X and factor VII were significantly higher, while activated partial thromboplastine time (aPTT) and soluble plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) were significantly decreased. Statistical analysis of high mobility group box 2 ̆ 013 1 protein (HMGB- 1), <b>soluble</b> intercellular <b>adhesive</b> molecule - 1 (sICAM- 1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI- 1) concentrations did not show significant differences between the total overweight and obese group and the normal weight group of dogs. Conclusions Analytical changes in the dogs in our study reflects that weight excess in dogs can be associated with a chronic low degree of inflammation and a hypercoagulable state, where primary and secondary hemostasis are both affected. However obesity is not associated with impairment of endothelial function in dogs...|$|R

AtT- 20 cells are a mouse pituitary cell line that can store proteins in a regulated fashion. By double-label immunofluorescence, P-selectin was visible as a punctate pattern at the tips of cell processes. This pattern closely resembled the localization of ACTH, the endogenous hormone produced and stored by the AtT- 20 cells. Fractionation of the transfected cells resulted in the codistribution of P-selectin and ACTH in cellular compartments of the same density. Immunoelectron microscopy using a polyclonal anti-P- selectin antibody demonstrated immunogold localization in dense granules, morphologically indistinguishable from the ACTH granules. Binding experiments with radiolabeled monoclonal antibody to P-selectin {{indicated that there was}} also surface expression of P-selectin on the AtT- 20 cells. After stimulation with the secretagogue 8 -Bromo-cAMP the surface expression increased twofold, concomitant with the release of ACTH. In contrast, the surface expression of P-selectin transfected into CHO cells, which do not have a regulated pathway of secretion, did not change with 8 -Br-cAMP treatment. In conclusion, we provide evidence for the regulated secretion of a transmembrane protein (P-selectin) in a heterologous cell line, which indicates that P-selectin contains an independent sorting signal directing it to storage granules...|$|E
40|$|Axonin- 1 is a {{glycoprotein}} that {{is released}} from axons of cultured neurons (Stoeckli, E. T., P. F. Lemkin, T. B. Kuhn, M. A. Ruegg, M. Heller, and P. Sonderegger. 1989. Eur. J. Biochem. 180 : 249 - 258). It {{has recently been}} purified from the ocular vitreous fluid of the chicken embryo (Ruegg, M. A., E. T. Stoeckli, T. B. Kuhn, M. Heller, R. Zuellig, and P. Sonderegger. 1989. EMBO (Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.) J. 8 : 55 - 63). Immunohistochemistry localized axonin- 1 prevalently in developing nerve fiber tracts. The presence of anti-axonin- 1 Fab fragments during axon growth in vitro resulted in antibody binding to the axonal surfaces and in a marked perturbation of the fasciculation pattern. Hence, a fraction of axonin- 1 is associated with axonal membranes and, by operational criteria, qualifies as a cell adhesion molecule. The major proportion of membrane-associated axonin- 1 co- solubilized with the integral membrane proteins. By physico-chemical, immunological, and protein-chemical criteria, the integral membrane form {{was found to be}} highly similar to soluble axonin- 1. In common with a number of other cell adhesion molecules, both soluble and membrane- bound axonin- 1 express the L 2 /HNK- 1 and the L 3 epitopes. Radioactive pulse-chase and double-labeling experiments revealed that the released form was not derived from the membrane-bound form by shedding from the membrane surface, but directly secreted from an intracellular pool. Due to its high degree of similarity to the membrane-associated form and the presence of the L 2 /HNK- 1 and L 3 epitopes, reported to be ligands in adhesive cell interactions, adhesive properties are postulated for secreted axonin- 1. As a <b>soluble</b> <b>adhesive</b> protein, it may function as a regulator of cell adhesion around its most likely site of secretion, the growth cone...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{correlate}} the disorders of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure with abnormalities in renal function, vascular endothelium, as well as serum melatonin levels before and after delivery in patients with preeclampsia. Subjects and methods A total of 91 women divided in four groups were enrolled in this perspective study. Group A consisted of patients with preeclampsia (n= 31), group B of women with gestational hypertension without proteinuria (n= 20) and group C included normotensive pregnant women (n= 20). Healthy non-pregnant women of a reproductive age formed group D (n= 20). From group A, 21 women were diagnosed with mild preeclampsia while the other 10 met at least one of the criteria of heavy preeclampsia. Renal function was assessed by 24 h urine protein excretion, serum creatinine, urea, uric acid and cystatin C. Endothelial function was assessed by markers of endothelial activation (von Willebrand factor) and damage (<b>soluble</b> <b>adhesive</b> molecules sVCAM- 1 and sICAM- 2). Serum melatonin and its major urine metabolite 6 -sulfatoxymelatonine (6 -SMT) levels were also evaluated in daytime and nighttime measurements. Subjects from group A and group B before the initiation of antihypertensive therapy underwent 24 h blood pressure monitoring. Moreover, in all women from both groups A and B, 24 h urine samples were collected and blood samples were obtained at 10 : 00 a. m. and at 00 : 00 of the same day. In women from group A, all sample collections mentioned above and blood pressure monitoring were repeated 2 months postpartum. Ιn women from group C and group D the 24 h urine collection as well as the collection of morning and nocturnal blood and urine samples was performed only once at their recruitment in the study. Results Women with preeclampsia had significantly higher body mass index (BMI), serum cystatin C and endothelial damage markers (vWf and sVCAM- 1) compared to women from the other groups in our study. On the contrary, nocturnal serum melatonin concentrations and morning urine 6 -SMT concentrations were significantly lower in the group of preeclampsia. Elimination of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure was defined as a decrease of the mean arterial pressure (MAP) during the night by less than 10 % compared to the MAP during the day (6 : 00 a. m. to 9 : 00 p. m.). According to that definition, 21 out of 31 women with preeclampsia (68 %), 8 out of 20 with gestational hypertension (40 %) and 2 out of 20 normotensive pregnant women (10 %) were considered as non-dippers. In group A (women with preeclampsia), non-dippers had significantly higher BMI and significantly elevated serum cystatin C, sVCAM- 1 and vWf compared to dippers. Serum uric acid levels and 24 h urine protein excretion were elevated in non-dippers but the differences were not statistically significant. In addition, serum nocturnal melatonin and morning urine 6 -SMT levels were significantly reduced in non-dippers with preeclampsia. Two months postpartum, 11 women out of 21 non-dippers (52 %) with preeclampsia continued to be non-dippers while the other 10 restored blood pressure circadian rhythm. In these new subgroup of dippers and non-dippers, it was demonstrated that non-dippers had higher proteinuria and serum cystatin C levels compared to dippers, while endothelial damage markers (vWf, sVCAM- 1 and sICAM- 1) were decreased in non-dippers. Serum nocturnal melatonin and morning urine 6 -SMT concentrations were still higher in non-dippers compared to dippers, while nocturnal melatonin secretion was normalized in dippers. ...|$|E

Further, TNF-alpha receptors and sICAM- 1 have been implicated in periportal fibrosis in advanced human schistosomiasis mansoni and correlate with schistosome granuloma formation in the murine model. We measured serum levels of sICAM- 1, TNFR-I and TNFR-II in Chinese patients with different clinically defined stages of schistosomiasis japonica and controls; these included 35 patients with acute schistosomiasis, 45 patients with chronic schistosome infections, 34 advanced patients with evidence of severe morbidity and 20 patients with no known history of exposure to infection. Markedly elevated levels of soluble TNFRs (sTNFRs) and sICAM- 1 were observed in the acute and advanced patients compared with the chronic and control groups. Mean sTNFR-II levels were significantly higher in acute patients compared with advanced (P <  0. 00001) and chronic patients (P <  0. 00001) and showed the strongest association of the markers with acute disease (odds ratio (OR)  =  1. 099). sTNFR-II and sICAM- 1 levels both correlated with infection intensity and there were significant positive correlations observed between eosinophil count and infection intensity (P =  0. 0072) and sICAM- 1 (P =  0. 0014). Although there were significantly higher levels of antigen-specific IgG 4 and total IgG in infected individuals compared with controls, none correlated with infection intensity.

Por lo anterior el objetivo del presente estudio es evaluar la precisión de dos técnicas de transferencia para la cementación indirecta de brackets preajustados. Para tal fin se compararon dos técnicas de cementación indirecta descritas a continuación; La primera técnica (grupo 1 – 6 modelos) consistió de 2 placas termo formables elaboradas al vacío: la primera es una lámina de caucho flexible de 0. 4 mm de espesor que contacta íntimamente la placa; y la segunda es una placa mas rígida CLEAR ADVANTAGE series I, Ortho technology, de 0. 4 mm de espesor.

Materials and methods: A rubber mold ORT 1006 is used 28 (ideal Occlusion) house Nissin Dental Products INC (Kyoto, Japan) in order to make emptying in acrylic, 20 accurate models (10 upper and 10 lower). Master Series preadjusted brackets System, Technical MBT slot 0. 022 (American Orthodontics, USA) for upper and lower jaw (5 to 5) and direct cementation tubes for first upper and lower molars (American Orthodontics, USA) were positioned. The method of adhesion of the brackets to the model, will be held following the methodology described by White in 2002, using a water <b>soluble</b> <b>adhesive</b> (Aleenes's Tacky Glue, USA). Once positioned the brackets, proceed to capture digital images using 3 D laser scanner processing laboratory models of American Orthodontics in Sheboygan, Wisconsin (USA), for Harmony Custom System. The procedure will be performed following the standard to minimize errors in radius and distance between centers and archives will be obtained in. stl format protocol. Subsequently transfer buckets customized for each of the two techniques to assess were manufactured: • The first technique consists of 2 plates thermos vacuum formable made: the first is a flexible rubber sheet 0. 4 mm thick intimately contacting plate; and the second is a more rigid plate Essix C + 0. 6 mm thick which is empty on the above, in order to give more rigidity to the transfer system. • The second technique requires the application by the vestibular face of the model, including the brackets, a transparent PVS Memosil Heraeus Kulzer ™ silicone, Germany. Once polymerized silicone, we will proceed to develop a rigid vacuum plate Essix C + 0. 6 mm thick to make the transfer. Once obtained the transfer plates, trimmed and adapted the model that will serve for assembly (the same previously scanned with brackets in position). To prepare this model, it was washed with hot water and stiff brush; it dried and subsequently Sandblast the labial surface to improve adhesion of the resin. After washing and drying again the model is applied to the bracket and the vestibular acrylic surface model liquid resin Assure Plus (liquid resin multipurpose increase adhesion acrylic) following the manufacturer's instructions (Reliance Orthodontic Products, Inc., USA). Subsequently nano-hybrid resin fluid Flow Grandio (VOCO, Germany) was applied {{to the base of the}} bracket and the bucket to settle in the model. For both types of plates transfer is perform photocuring using an LED light-curing. VALO (Ultradent, USA). Once polymerized resin, proceed to remove the transfer buckets of the first technique; and transfer tray and silicone to the second technique. Models with the brackets will again be scanned using the same 3 D scanner Orthodontic processing laboratory models of American Orthodontics.

In a previous paper (Gennarini, G., P. Durbec, A. Boned, G. Rougon, and C. Goridis. 1991. Neuron. 6 : 595 - 606), we have established that F 3 fulfills the operational definition of a cell adhesion molecule and that it stimulates neurite outgrowth when presented to sensory neurons as a surface component of transfected CHO cells. In the present study the question as to whether soluble forms of F 3 would be functionally active was addressed in vitro on cultures of mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. We observed that preparations enriched in soluble F 3 had no effect on neuron attachment but enhanced neurite initiation and neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner. By contrast, soluble NCAM- 120 does not have any measurable effect on these phenomena. Addition of anti-F 3 monovalent antibodies reduced the number of process-bearing neurons and the neuritic output per neuron to control values. Addition of cerebrospinal fluid, a natural source of soluble F 3, also stimulated neurite extension, and this effect was partially blocked by anti-F 3 antibodies. Our results suggest that the <b>soluble</b> forms of <b>adhesive</b> proteins with neurite outgrowth-promoting properties could act at a distance from their site of release in a way reminiscent of growth and trophic factors...|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} {{fabricating}} improved transformer cores from composites of thermoplastic matrices and iron-particles has been invented. Relative to commercially available laminated-iron-alloy transformer cores, the cores fabricated by this method weigh less {{and are less}} expensive. Relative to prior polymer-matrix/ iron-particle composite-material transformer cores, the cores fabricated by this method can be made mechanically stronger and more magnetically permeable. In addition, whereas some prior cores have exhibited significant eddy-current losses, the cores fabricated by this method exhibit very small eddy-current losses.

The present method is a product of an experimental study of the relationships among fabrication conditions, final densities of iron particles, and mechanical and electromagnetic properties of fabricated cores. Among the fabrication conditions investigated were molding pressures (83, 104, and 131 MPa), and molding temperatures (250, 300, and 350 C). Each block of core material was made by uniaxial-compression molding, at the applicable pressure/temperature combination, of a mixture of 2 weight percent of LaRC (or equivalent high-temperature <b>soluble</b> thermoplastic <b>adhesive)</b> with 98 weight percent of approximately spherical iron particles having diameters in the micron range. Each molded block was cut into square cross-section rods that were used as core specimens in mechanical and electromagnetic tests. Some of the core specimens were annealed at 900 C and cooled slowly before testing. For comparison, a low-carbon-steel core was also tested. The results of the tests showed that density, hardness, and rupture strength generally increased with molding pressure and temperature, though the correlation was rather weak. The weakness of the correlation was attributed to the pores in the specimens. The maximum relative permeabilities of cores made without annealing ranged from 30 to 110, while those of cores made with annealing ranged from 900 to 1, 400. However, the greater permeabilities of the annealed specimens were not associated with noticeably greater densities. The major practical result of the investigation was the discovery of an optimum distribution of iron-particle sizes: It was found that eddy-current losses in the molded cores were minimized by using 100 mesh (corresponding to particles with diameters {{less than or equal to}} 100 m) iron particles.

In the crustacean processing unit, the dumping of large quantities of discards into the environment lead to a major problem of accumulation of discards due to the very slow biodegradation of chitin. Instead of simply dumping the waste, the shrimp and crab wastes have been widely used for the isolation of chitin, followed by its usage in food packaging. In this study, the prawn wastes were collected from the Muttom and the chitin and chitosan were isolated using simple chemical method. The yield of chitin and chitosan was 31 % and 58 % respectively.

This {{can be achieved}} by either physical stabilization or chemical functionalization. Functionalization usually expands the possible applications for the conducting materials depending on the properties of the functional groups. Processable conducting materials can also be combined with other co-dissolving materials to prepare composites with desired chemical and physical properties. Polyanilines (PANI) doped with dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) are soluble in many organic solvents such as chloroform and toluene. Single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) can be dispersed into PANI/DBSA to form homogeneous solutions. PANI/DBSA functions as a conducting surfactant for SWCNTs. The mixture can beiicombined with two-parts polyurethanes that co-dissolve in the organic solvent to produce conducting polymer composites. The composite mixtures can be applied onto various substrates by simple spray-on methods to obtain transparent and conducting coatings. Graphene, a single layer of graphite, has drawn intense interest for its unique properties. Processable graphene has been produced in N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP) by a one-step solvothermal reduction of graphite oxide without the aid of any reducing reagent and/or surfactant. The as-synthesized graphene disperses well in a variety of organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), ethanol and tetrahydrogenfuran (THF). The conductivity of solvothermal reduced graphite oxide is comparable to hydrazine reduced graphite oxide. Attempts were made to create intrinsically conducting glue comparable to mussel adhesive protiens using polyaniline and graphene. Mussels can attach to a variety of substrates under water.

40|$|The {{integrin}} αVβ 5 is a receptor for sCD 23 molecule and the αVβ 5 -CD 23 interaction sustains {{proliferation of}} the pre-B cell line SMS-SB. This thesis describes further {{investigation into the}} role of αVβ 5 integrin during human B cell development. B cell development in the bone marrow involves stepwise maturation of progenitor cells through different defined stages. A tight regulation of proliferation and differentiation mediates the progression of progenitor cells through this developmental pathway. A variety of signals from <b>soluble</b> molecules and <b>adhesive</b> interactions regulate this balance of proliferation and differentiation. The main aim of this work was to assess the importance of the integrin αVβ 5 during B cell development by defining its expression and function during specific stages of B cell development in the bone marrow. The αVβ 5 integrin was expressed by B cell precursors in the bone marrow, by different pre-B cell lines and the αVβ 5 -CD 23 interaction sustained proliferation of some pre-B cell lines. The pre-B cell lines SMS-SB, RS 4; 11 and 697 showed a significant proliferative response to αVβ 5 stimulation by sCD 23, a sCD 23 -derived long peptide and anti-αVβ 5 MAb 15 F 11. Transitional and more mature B cell lines down-regulated αVβ 5 expression and did not show a proliferative response. Both αVβ 5 and αVβ 3 integrin could be detected on normal bone marrow B cell precursor populations, though αVβ 5 was the more highly expressed integrin. In preliminary functional experiments, stimulation of CD 19 +/κ- cells with sCD 23 induced cell proliferation whereas equivalent treatment of CD 19 +/κ+ cells did not. The data are consistent with the interpretation that αVβ 5 integrin is expressed in B cell precursors but that its ability to sustain growth of these cells wanes as the cells mature towards a membrane immunoglobulin-positive state. The αVβ 5 -mediated proliferation was enhanced by the chemokine SDF- 1 and PDGF but not by the cytokines IL- 3, IL- 4, IL- 7 or IL- 11. This effect was apparently restricted to earlier B cell precursors and was independent of levels of expression of both αVβ 5 and CXCR 4. Stimulation of SMS-SB cells by αVβ 5 ligands provoked ERK phosphorylation and co-stimulation with SDF- 1 promoted a more rapid and sustained ERK activation. PDGF induced a similar effect on αVβ 5 -mediated activation of ERKphosphorylation. These data suggest that ligation of αVβ 5 by soluble, adhesion-independent stimuli activates ERK phosphorylation and this pathway can be modulated by inputs from G-protein-coupled and tyrosine kinase receptors. The murine pro-B cell line BAF 03 also displayed αVβ 5 -mediated proliferation in response to human CD 23. Preliminary experiments showed that human CD 23 sustained growth of murine bone marrow B cell precursors. Therefore, these data suggest that murine B cells can also use αVβ 5 integrin to sustain their growth and the studies described here in human cell lines could be translated into in vivo murine models. Further work is needed to confirm the proliferative response due to the αVβ 5 -CD 23 interaction in normal B cell precursors in the bone marrow and to define the exact stage of development where this interaction is critical. In addition to its expression in the bone marrow B cell precursors, previous work has also demonstrated the expression of αVβ 5 integrin in B cells from patients with ALL. Therefore, the αVβ 5 -CD 23 interaction could have important implications not only in proliferation of normal B cell precursors but also in proliferation of neoplastic B cells. These data identify the αVβ 5 -CD 23 interaction as a potentially important interaction during early B cell development, as αVβ 5 expression and function is stage-specific, regulated by other molecules and can be demonstrated in both human and murine cell lines.

40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Ciências Biomédicas (Ciências Funcionais), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Medicina, 2013 Neutrophils {{are among}} the first leukocytes to migrate from the blood to sites of inflammation. Here, {{they are able to}} {{recognize}} and engulf inflammatory agents, such as infectious agents and activate various anti-microbial strategies to inactivate and destroy them. Importantly, an efficient neutrophil recruitment and function will be pivotal for the success of the inflammatory response in recovering the host’s health. In inflammatory conditions, neutrophil recruitment from the bloodstream through the vascular endothelium into interstitial tissues requires successive interactions of neutrophils with the endothelial cells throughout this multistep process. Among diverse cellular adhesion molecules involved is the β 2 -integrin Mac- 1 (CD 11 b/CD 18), that by binding the endothelial ICAM- 1 is specifically required during firm adhesion and leukocyte crawling. Additionally, this integrin has been shown to bind fibrinogen with a strong affinity as well as to its clotting product fibrin, among other molecular targets. Fibrinogen is a soluble glycoprotein present in the plasma that is importantly required for coagulation and the major determinant of blood viscosity and flow. It has been also proposed as a relevant player in inflammation in view of its ability to modulate the neutrophil function by potentiating degranulation, phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and by providing survival cues that delay apoptosis of activated neutrophils. One possible explanation for these effects could be that by binding Mac- 1 in a low-avidity state, fibrinogen could function as a primer for resting neutrophils and thus decrease the threshold for cell activation. Taken all this, our goal in the present work was to address whether circulating fibrinogen could also modulate neutrophil recruitment and thus understand its role in the mechanism of microvascular inflammatory response. In this respect, we hypothesized that upon binding Mac- 1, plasma fibrinogen could potentiate neutrophil-endothelial cell interaction by priming the neutrophil to a more adhesive phenotype. To test this, we first investigated whether soluble fibrinogen could modulate neutrophil activation, more precisely concerning the production of oxygen free radicals (OFR). By combining flow cytometry with dihydrorhodamine 123, we showed that by itself, soluble fibrinogen could induce OFR production by neutrophils isolated from human peripheral blood, arguing it could modulate neutrophil activation. Furthermore, we demonstrated this effect not to be Mac- 1 dependent as: (i) fibrinogen did not interfere with the neutrophil Mac- 1 activation and (2) an anti-total Mac- 1 antibody known to block this integrin function did not impair the induced OFR production. Finally, binding of fibrinogen to the neutrophil’s membrane was observed independently of its co-localization with Mac- 1 staining, arguing for the fibrinogen interaction with another unidentified neutrophil membrane receptor. Next, we addressed in vitro whether fibrinogen could modulate the adhesive behaviour of circulating neutrophils. For such, we used flow chamber assays that allowed the visualization and study of cell adhesion processes under well-defined wall shear stress. Human neutrophils were flown over monolayers of HUVECs at a constant wall shear stress of 0, 1 dynes/cm 2 in {{the presence or absence of}} <b>soluble</b> fibrinogen. Neutrophil’s <b>adhesive</b> behaviour was evaluated by determining the numbers of rolling and adherent neutrophils and the velocity of rolling. Under a physiological concentration (300 mg/dL) of fibrinogen, the number of rolling neutrophils was not significantly affected in comparison to that measured in its absence. Surprisingly, the rolling velocities measured for the first were significantly higher than those exhibited by the latter. Additionally, the number of adherent fibrinogen-treated neutrophils was smaller than that determined for non-treated ones. This showed that at physiological concentrations, soluble fibrinogen could modulate the adhesive behaviour of circulating neutrophils towards activated endothelium. This effect may be important in a non-inflammatory condition by preventing excessive adhesion of neutrophils to the vascular wall and enabling adherent cells to easily detach from it. It may constitute an important mechanism to prevent unwanted accumulation of neutrophils in the vasculature and to avoid thrombus formation and growth. These results led us to propose that fibrinogen could further influence leukocyte recruitment in vivo and particularly, impact on the normal progression of acute inflammation. To explore this, the effect of soluble fibrinogen on leukocyte recruitment in acute inflammation was next evaluated in vivo by intravital microscopy of post-capillary venules of mouse mesentery. This approach allowed us to address specifically its contribution for leukocyte rolling and adhesion by determining the number of rolling leukocytes, their rolling velocities and the number of adherent leukocytes. To enable the in vivo study of leukocyte recruitment in the absence of soluble fibrinogen in the bloodstream, we made use of a mouse model bearing a disrupted fibrinogen α chain gene for which, homozygous individuals had been shown not to express any experimentally detected plasmatic soluble fibrinogen. As control groups, wild-type and heterozygous mice, known to possess normal coagulation patterns, were used. Acute inflammation was mimicked by superfusing the mesentery with PAF, a well-known neutrophil activator. Under these conditions, a slightly reduced number of rolling leukocytes was observed in homozygous (α-/-) mice when compared to both control groups. Despite this, rolling leukocytes migrated with increased velocities in homozygous (α-/-) mice when compared to those from control animals. Consistently, homozygous mice further displayed a diminished number of adherent leukocytes than the other groups. Overall, these observations led us to conclude that leukocyte recruitment is compromised in the absence of soluble fibrinogen in the blood circulation. Altogether our studies led us to conclude that soluble fibrinogen can modulate neutrophil activation and importantly, that it should constitute an important factor for leukocyte recruitment in acute inflammation. As soluble fibrinogen is able to bind either to the neutrophil or to the endothelial cell, one could envisage that it could also be able to bridge these two cellular identities and possibly favour a more stable and effective leukocyte recruitment. These results have profound implications in inflammation. As central players in the process, leukocytes need rapidly to cross the vascular wall and reach the inflamed areas. If this is affected due to absent or reduced levels of plasmatic soluble fibrinogen, ineffective immune responses will be elicited to invading pathogens. This will compromise the organism’s health by enhancing the risk of sepsis development among other possible pathological consequences. Os neutrófilos estão entre os primeiros leucócitos a migrar da corrente sanguínea para o local da inflamação. Um vez no local, estes possuem a capacidade de reconhecer e englobar os agentes causadores de infecções desenvolvendo estratégias anti-microbianas de forma a conseguir desativar e destruir esses mesmos agentes. Assim sendo, é importante salientar que um recrutamento de neutrófilos funcional e eficiente é fundamental para o sucesso da resposta inflamatória e para recuperação da saúde do hospedeiro. Em situações inflamatórias, o recrutamento dos neutrófilos é feito a partir do sangue e através do endotélio vascular para os tecidos intersticiais, este recrutamento consiste num processo com várias etapas que requer interações sucessivas do neutrófilos com as células endoteliais. Entre as várias moléculas de adesão celular envolvidas neste processo, é a integrina-β 2, Mac- 1 (CD 11 b/CD 18), que permite que neutrófilos se liguem á ICAM- 1 endotelial, passo essencial para a adesão firme dos leucócitos e o seu consequente alongamento. Além disso, foi também demonstrado que o fibrinogénio, assim como a fibrina, são ligandos de alta afinidade para esta mesma integrina, para além de outros alvos moleculares. O fibrinogénio é uma glicoproteina solúvel que está presente no plasma, sendo um dos elementos determinantes para o fluxo e viscosidade sanguínea, desempenhando ainda uma função fundamental na coagulação. Para além desta funções sobejamente conhecidas foi proposto por vários autores que fibrinogénio tem também uma função relevante no processo inflamatório tendo em conta a sua capacidade em modular a função do neutrófilo potenciando a sua desgranulação, fagocitose e atrasando a apoptose dos neutrófilos ativados. Uma das possíveis explicações para estes efeitos está diretamente relacionada com a ligação do fibrinogénio á Mac- 1 quando esta se encontra em baixa afinidade, o fibrinogénio pode não só pre-ativar os neutrófilos mas também facilitar a sua ativação. Tendo tudo isto em consideração, o objetivo deste trabalho consiste investigar se o fibrinogénio solúvel que se encontra em circulação pode ou não modular o recrutamento dos neutrófilos e desta forma modular a resposta inflamatória microvascular. Na primeira abordagem a esta pergunta começou-se por investigar se o fibrinogénio solúvel ao ligar-se á Mac- 1, poderia facilitar a interação entre as células endoteliais e os neutrófilos facilitando a sua adesão. Começou-se por tentar perceber se o fibrinogénio solúvel pode modular a ativação dos neutrófilos, tendo como medida de ativação a produção de radicais livres de oxigénio (OFR). Recorrendo á citometria de fluxo e á incubação dos neutrófilos com diidrorodamina 123, conseguiu-se provar que o fibrinogénio só por si induz a produção de OFR pelos neutrófilos isolados a partir de sangue periférico humano, ativando-os. Para além disso, demonstrou-se ainda que este efeito não é dependente da ligação do fibrinogénio á Mac- 1, uma vez que, mesmo quando foi utilizado um anticorpo bloqueador da Mac- 1 a produção de OFR não foi afectada. Para além disso, foi também verificado por microscopia confocal que não existe uma colocalização entre a marcação por Mac- 1 e pelo fibrinogénio, o que sugere um receptor ainda não identificado para o fibrinogénio, na membrana do neutrófilo. Seguidamente, utilizando uma abordagem in vitro, investigou-se se o fibrinogénio conseguia modular o efeito adesivo dos neutrófilos em circulação. Para tal recorreu-se ao uso de uma camara de fluxo laminar que permitiu a visualização do processo de adesão com “shear-stress constante. Os neutrófilos isolados a partir de sangue periférico humano foram colocados sobre uma monocamada de HUVECs com um fluxo constante de 0, 1 dynes/cm 2 na presença e na ausência de fibrinogénio solúvel. O comportamento adesivo dos neutrófilos foi avaliado contando o numero de neutrófilos em rolamento e aderidos e determinando a sua velocidade de rolamento. A uma concentração fisiológica (300 mg/dL) de fibrinogénio, o numero de neutrófilos em rolamento não foi afectado significativamente quando comparado com o numero encontrado na ausência de fibrinogénio. Mas surpreendentemente as velocidades de rolamento foram significativamente superiores na presença do fibrinogénio. Determinou-se ainda que o numero de neutrófilos aderidos na presença de fibrinogénio foi mais pequeno do que na sua ausência. O que conduziu á conclusão que o solúvel fibrinogénio em concentrações fisiológicas podem influenciar a adesão dos neutrófilos circulantes à parede endotelial ativada. Este efeito assume especial importância em situações não-inflamatórias, prevenindo a adesão excessiva de neutrófilos á parede vascular e também facilitando que células aderentes facilmente se libertem. Pode assim constituir um mecanismo importante para prevenir a acumulação não desejada de neutrófilos na vasculatura e impedir a formação e crescimento de trombos vasculares. Estes resultados conduziram a que se propusesse que o fibrinogénio pode influenciar o recrutamento dos leucócitos in vivo, e particularmente, ter um importante impacto na normal progressão de uma inflamação aguda. De forma a explorar esta hipótese, o efeito do fibrinogénio solúvel no recrutamento dos leucócitos durante uma inflamação aguda, foi utilizada uma abordagem in vivo, recorrendo á microscopia intravital das vénulas pós-capilares do mesentério do murganho. Esta abordagem permitiu visualizar diretamente e contar o numero de leucócitos aderidos e em rolamento assim como determinar as sua velocidades de rolamento. O modelo animal utilizado nesta abordagem foi um murganho geneticamente alterado, sem a cadeia α do fibrinogénio o que faz com que os indivíduos homozigoticos não possuam fibrinogénio em circulação. Como grupo controlo foram utilizados murganhos “wild-type” e heterozigoticos que possuem um padrão de coagulação normal. De forma a recriar uma situação de inflamação aguda, perfundiu-se o mesentério com PAF, um ativador de neutrófilos bem descrito na literatura. Nesta condições, foi encontrado um numero ligeiramente reduzido de leucócitos em rolamento nos murganhos homozigoticos(α-/-) quando comparado com o numero encontrado tanto nos murganhos heterozigoticos como nos “wild-type”. No entanto, a velocidade de rolamento é superior nos murganhos homozigoticos(α-/-) quando comparada com os mesmos grupos controlo. Consistentemente com este resultado, também o numero de leucócitos aderentes foi inferior neste grupo quando comparado com o mesmo grupo controlo. Estes resultados permitiram concluir que o recrutamento leucocitário ficou comprometido na ausência do fibrinogénio solúvel em circulação. De uma forma global, este trabalho permitiu concluir que o fibrinogénio solúvel pode modular a ativação dos neutrófilos e ainda constituir um factor importante para o recrutamento leucocitário durante uma situação de inflamação aguda. O fibrinogénio solúvel tem a capacidade de se ligar não só ao neutrófilo mas também ás células endoteliais, podendo assim servir de ponte de ligação entre estas duas identidades celulares e desta forma favorecer um recrutamento leucocitário mais eficaz e mais estável. Estes resultados tem implicações importantes no processo inflamatório. Sendo os neutrófilos células determinantes neste processo, precisam de conseguir atravessar rapidamente a parede vascular e chegar ao local onde ocorre a inflamação. Se este processo se encontra comprometido devido a uma concentração reduzida ou mesmo á ausência de fibrinogénio solúvel em circulação, a resposta imunitária fica comprometida e suscetível á invasão por agentes patogénicos.
