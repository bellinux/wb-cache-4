25|$|Frith {{was born}} in Heathfield in Sussex, England into a family where music was {{considered}} {{an essential part of}} life. He started violin lessons at the age of five and became a member of his school orchestra. But at 13 he switched to guitar after watching a group imitating a popular instrumental band at the time, the Shadows. He decided to learn how to play guitar and get into a band. Frith taught himself guitar from a book of guitar chords and soon found himself in a school group called The Chaperones, playing Shadows and Beatles covers. But when Frith started hearing blues music from the likes of <b>Snooks</b> Eaglin and Alexis Korner it changed his whole approach to the guitar, {{and by the time he}} was 15, The Chaperones had become a blues band.

25|$|After {{shakedown}} {{training off}} the New England coast, Snook departed New London on 3 March 1943 and set sail for the Pacific. Following a 12-day stopover at Pearl Harbor, the submarine put to sea on 11 April {{and headed for}} the Yellow Sea and East China Sea for her first war patrol. Upon completion of mine planting in the Shanghai area, Snook continued on up the coast of China to the Yellow Sea. On the afternoon of 5 May, she sighted two freighters standing out of Dairen and took up the chase. She trailed both until after nightfall, then fired a spread of three torpedoes that quickly sank Kinko Maru. The lead freighter continued, unaware of the attack, until someone on the sinking ship sounded a whistle. At that point, the freighter began a series of frantic maneuvers to dodge two of <b>Snooks</b> torpedoes, then opened fire with her guns, forcing the submarine to withdraw out of range, returning shortly after and firing three torpedoes, one of which hit Daifuku Maru amidships and sank her. Snook then resumed patrol.|$|E

On 12 April, she was ordered to take lifeguard station in the vicinity of Sakishima Gunto in support of British carrier air strikes. On 20 April, the commander of the British carrier task force reported that he had a plane down in <b>Snooks</b> assigned area, and that he could not contact the submarine by radio. Snook was ordered to search the area and to acknowledge the order. When she failed to make a transmission, submarine [...] was sent to make the search and rendezvous with Snook. Although Bang arrived and rescued the downed aviators, she saw no sign of the missing submarine; on 16 May, Snook was presumed lost due to unknown causes. It is believed that she was sunk by kaibokans Okinawa, CD-8, CD-32 and CD-52. It has also been suggested that Snook may have been lost in combat with one of five Japanese submarines which were also lost in April–May 1945. One candidate is the Japanese submarine I-56 [...] (type B3) but it is just a hypothesis because it is not confirmed by a single Japanese source.|$|E

50|$|The common <b>snook</b> is an estuarine-dependent fish species. Within estuaries, {{juvenile}} common <b>snook</b> {{are most}} often found inhabiting areas such as coastal wetland ponds, island networks, and creeks. Despite being a euryhaline species of fish, common <b>snook</b> do show a tendency to gravitate towards lower salinity conditions {{in the early stages}} of their life. By being able to adapt and thrive in both high and low salinity conditions through osmoregulation, common <b>snook</b> display a high level of habitat plasticity. Common <b>snook</b> are opportunistic predators whose feeding habits indicate that there is a positive relationship between their size and the size of their prey, meaning that as the <b>snook</b> grows it feeds on larger and larger prey. Common <b>snook</b> have been found to occasionally engage in cannibalistic activities, though this behavior is rare. This usually occurs during the winter months when adult and juvenile common <b>snook</b> are in close proximity to one another within their estuarine habitats. This form of cannibalism where the juveniles are fed on by the adults is referred to as intercohort cannibalism. The adult common <b>snook</b> who do cannibalize juveniles most likely target them due to the fact that the juveniles may be the largest of the available prey, and are therefore more nutritionally efficient to prey upon.|$|R
