5|$|The Hiroshima {{authorities}} took {{advice about}} the city's reconstruction from foreign consultants, and in 1947 Tam Deling, an American park planner, suggested they build a Peace Memorial and preserve buildings situated near ground zero, that point directly below {{the explosion of}} the atomic bomb.

5|$|Macaulay's {{final two}} seasons were {{affected}} by injury, as he was increasingly bothered by rheumatism. In the 1934 season, while trying to take a catch, he injured the finger he used to spin the ball. He did not appear for Yorkshire until June, but went on to take 55 wickets {{at an average of}} 23.43. The next season was his final one. He only played nine matches, taking 22 wickets at 20.09. At the end of the year, he retired from first-class cricket and Yorkshire awarded him a <b>special</b> <b>grant</b> of £250. Yorkshire did have a replacement in mind; Frank Smailes was considered to be versatile enough in his bowling style to take Macaulay's place, {{but it was not until}} Ellis Robinson secured a place in 1937 that a new specialist off-spinner was found.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the origin and}} persistence of agricultural research earmarks. Since 1965, {{a significant portion of}} USDA research funds have been directly earmarked by Congress for particular research projects. These so-called “special grants ” are a source of political pork for individual legislators. While <b>special</b> <b>grants</b> have become a vehicle for pork-barrel politics, this outcome was the unintended consequence of legislation sought by the USDA to deploy its research funds more efficiently. We illustrate and model the process by which a minority of Congress is able to induce the USDA to carry out its budgetary suggestions and show that the elimination of <b>special</b> <b>grants</b> is unlikely in spite of intense opposition from particular legislators, the White House, and the academy. The story of the <b>special</b> <b>grants</b> program provides an excellent illustration of path-dependence in government policy as well {{as an example of how}} distributive politics can arise in a context without voting...|$|R
25|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{acquiring}} citizenship, the Cook Islands, Niue, the Ross Dependency and Tokelau are treated as part of New Zealand – hence, for example, a child born in Tokelau to a Tokelauan permanent resident would qualify for New Zealand citizenship. However, for Samoan citizens applying for a <b>special</b> <b>grant</b> of New Zealand citizenship, the Cook Islands, Niue, the Ross Dependency and Tokelau are not treated as part of New Zealand.|$|E

When encore broadcasts of Adventures in Good Music ceased entirely on June 29, 2007, Exploring Music gained an even wider national listenership, {{as it was then}} scheduled in the retired show's time slot on many radio stations.|$|E
25|$|Peregrini {{could also}} acquire {{citizenship}} individually, either through {{service in the}} auxilia for the minimum 25-year term, or by <b>special</b> <b>grant</b> of the emperor for merit or status. The key person in the grant of citizenship to individuals was the provincial governor: although citizenship awards could only {{be made by the}} emperor, the latter would generally act on the recommendation of his governors, as is clear from the letters of Pliny the Younger. As governor of Bithynia, Pliny successfully lobbied his boss, the emperor Trajan (r.98-117), to grant citizenship to a number of provincials who were Pliny's friends or assistants.|$|E

25|$|Haseltine then {{helped design}} {{programs}} to transfer knowledge from academic laboratories to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies {{to develop new}} anti viral drugs. Early on pharmaceutical companies were reluctant to initiate new research programs on HIV/AIDS. Biotechnology companies lacked the necessary funds and expertise for such work. To address this issue, Haseltine suggested that NIAID create a <b>special</b> <b>grant</b> program to encourage pharmaceutical and biotech companies to work on HIV related problems. Under this program a relatively large amount of money was granted to academic scientists provided that their laboratory have a pharmaceutical or biotechnology partner capable of translating knew knowledge to new drugs. The majority of the funds of these grants went to the industry partner to encourage {{the development of new}} drug research activities. These co-operative drug development grants led directly to the discovery of the protease inhibitors that changed the course of HIV/AIDS treatment and later to drugs that effectively target the integrase and envelope proteins.|$|E
