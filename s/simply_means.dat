5|$|Haystacks is {{the common}} English title {{for a series of}} impressionist {{paintings}} by Claude Monet. The principle subject of each painting in the series is stacks of harvested wheat (or possibly barley or oats: the original French title, Les Meules à Giverny, <b>simply</b> <b>means</b> The Stacks at Giverny). The title refers primarily to a twenty-five canvas series (Wildenstein Index Numbers 1266-1290) which Monet began {{near the end of the}} summer of 1890 and continued through the following spring though Monet also produced earlier paintings using this same stack subject.|$|E
5|$|The luster of {{a diamond}} is {{described}} as 'adamantine', which <b>simply</b> <b>means</b> diamond-like. Reflections on a properly cut diamond's facets are undistorted, due to their flatness. The refractive index of diamond (as measured via sodium light, 589.3nm) is 2.417. Because it is cubic in structure, diamond is also isotropic. Its high dispersion of 0.044 (variation of refractive index across the visible spectrum) manifests in the perceptible fire of cut diamonds. This fire—flashes of prismatic colors seen in transparent stones—is perhaps diamond's most important optical property from a jewelry perspective. The prominence or amount of fire seen in a stone is heavily influenced by the choice of diamond cut and its associated proportions (particularly crown height), although the body color of fancy (i.e., unusual) diamonds may hide their fire to some degree.|$|E

25|$|The Socialist Party has {{consistently}} opposed nationalism {{of any sort}} throughout its history.

25|$|Logic is {{generally}} considered formal when it analyzes and represents the form of any valid argument type. The form of an argument is displayed by representing its sentences in the formal grammar and symbolism of a logical language to make its content usable in formal inference. Simply put, formalising <b>simply</b> <b>means</b> translating English sentences into the language of logic.|$|E
25|$|More generally, vector {{calculus}} can {{be defined}} on any 3-dimensional oriented Riemannian manifold, or more generally pseudo-Riemannian manifold. This structure <b>simply</b> <b>means</b> that the tangent space at each point has an inner product (more generally, a symmetric nondegenerate form) and an orientation, or more globally {{that there is a}} symmetric nondegenerate metric tensor and an orientation, and works because vector calculus is defined in terms of tangent vectors at each point.|$|E

25|$|Byzantine {{failures}} {{are considered}} the most general and most difficult class of failures among the failure modes. The so-called fail-stop failure mode occupies the simplest end of the spectrum. Whereas fail-stop failure model <b>simply</b> <b>means</b> {{that the only way}} to fail is a node crash, detected by other nodes, Byzantine failures imply no restrictions, which means that the failed node can generate arbitrary data, pretending to be a correct one, which makes fault tolerance difficult.|$|E

Although this species is highly prized as a food {{it is difficult to}} cultivate and rarely farmed commercially.|$|E
25|$|The term 'icon' {{comes from}} the Greek word eikon, which <b>simply</b> <b>means</b> image. The Orthodox believe that the first icons of Christ and the Virgin Mary were painted by Luke the Evangelist. Icons are filled with {{symbolism}} designed to convey information about the person or event depicted. For this reason, icons tend to be formulaic, following a prescribed methodology for how a particular person should be depicted, including hair style, body position, clothing, and background details.|$|E

Bhakti is mentioned in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad where it <b>simply</b> <b>means</b> participation, devotion and love for any endeavor. Bhakti yoga as one of three spiritual paths for salvation is discussed in depth by the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
25|$|Peer-reviewed {{research}} undertaken {{since then}} has not validated previous assumptions. Recent research indicates that inflating students' self-esteem {{in and of itself}} has no positive effect on grades. Roy Baumeister has shown that inflating self-esteem by itself can actually decrease grades. The relationship involving self-esteem and academic results does not signify that high self-esteem contributes to high academic results. It <b>simply</b> <b>means</b> that high self-esteem may be accomplished as a result of high academic performance due to the other variables of social interactions and life events affecting this performance.|$|E
25|$|The minor Taíno gods {{related to}} the growing of cassava, the process of life, {{creation}} and death. Baibrama was a minor god worshiped for his assistance in growing cassava and curing people from its poisonous juice. Boinayel and his twin brother Márohu were the gods of rain and fair weather, respectively. Guabancex was the non-nurturing aspect of the goddess Atabey who had control over natural disasters. Juracán is often identified as the god of storms but the word <b>simply</b> <b>means</b> hurricane in the Taíno language. Guabancex had two assistants: Guataubá, a messenger who created hurricane winds, and Coatrisquie who created floodwaters.|$|E

25|$|Nofekh (נֹפֶךְ = in the masoretic text) / Anthrax (in the Septuagint) - while Anthrax <b>simply</b> <b>means</b> coal (presumably here {{referring}} to the colour of burning coal), the Vulgate here has Carbunculus, {{referring to}} the Carbuncle, which was red. Philo of Alexandria, when writing about this stone, says that it was red. He {{seems to be in}} agreement with Josephus, the LXX, and the Jerusalem Targum, the latter saying that it is כדכדנא, explained by Saadia Gaon as meaning karkand, a red variety of precious stone. Nofekh appears to be a loan word; it may derive from the Egyptian term m-f-k-t, referring to Malachite or Turquoise, both of which are a greenish blue; it may instead derive from lupakku, a term appearing in the Amarna letters, referring to a mineral of unknown colour which was sent in tribute to Akhnaten from Ashkalon. In classical rabbinical literature there is some debate between whether Nofekh was red or greenish blue; Exodus Rabbah and the second Jerusalem Targum favour it being red, while the Babylonian Targum and first Jerusalem Targum favour it being green.|$|E
