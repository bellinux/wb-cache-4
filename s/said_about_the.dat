5|$|One of {{the biggest}} criticisms Steiner {{received}} was that he himself believed what his fictive Hitler <b>said</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Jews. It was also thought {{that at the end}} of the London theatre production, the audience were applauding Hitler and not the play.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of this confrontation, Henry {{unexpectedly}} fell ill and died near Lyons-la-Forêt. It is uncertain what, if anything, Henry <b>said</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> succession before his death. Contemporary chronicler accounts were coloured by subsequent events. Sources favourable to Matilda suggested that Henry had reaffirmed his intent to grant all his lands to his daughter, while hostile chroniclers argued that Henry had renounced his former plans and had apologised for having forced the barons to swear an oath of allegiance to her.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June 1942, Marseille {{claimed his}} 100th aerial victory. He was the 11th Luftwaffe pilot {{to achieve the}} century mark. Marseille then {{returned}} to Germany for two months leave and the following day was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords. On 6 August, he began his journey back to North Africa accompanied by his fiancée Hanne-Lies Küpper. On 13 August, he met Benito Mussolini in Rome and was presented with the highest Italian military award for bravery, the Medaglia d'Oro al Valor Militare. While in Italy Marseille disappeared for some time prompting the German authorities to compile a missing persons report, submitted by the Gestapo head in Rome, Herbert Kappler. He was finally located. According to rumours he had run off with an Italian girl and was eventually persuaded {{to return to his}} unit. Unusually, nothing was ever <b>said</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> incident and no repercussions were visited upon Marseille for this indiscretion.|$|E

5|$|Also {{noting the}} unachievable {{ambition}} {{of solving the}} conflict between naturalism and religion, Martin A Greenman, remarks that one must come to the book “with a certain mood”. Too critical a mood would blind the reader to its religious insights, while the sensitivity and depth of its philosophic insights would be lost {{if one were to}} approach it in a too enthusiastically religious mood. Greenman finishes by justifying Stace’s philosophy to logical positivists by quoting from Wittgenstein's Tractatus: “My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them….He must surmount these propositions: then he sees the world rightly” (6. 54.) Dorothy M. Emmet found issue with the notion that the mystical experience is the point of intersection between the temporal and eternal orders. She writes that there are difficulties in Stace defining these orders as two distinct “orders of being”, rather than just as a way of speaking, because this then means some statements about the temporal order are relevant to what is <b>said</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> eternal order and vice versa. Indeed, the interrelation between these two orders is difficult to maintain. She also questioned Stace’s characterisation of mystical consciousness as being the same everywhere.|$|E

25|$|The Ottoman Empire {{ruled in}} {{accordance}} to Islamic law. As such, the People of the Book (the Christians and the Jews) had to pay an extra tax to fulfil their status as dhimmi and in return were guaranteed religious autonomy.

25|$|The {{diversity}} of A. mellifera subspecies {{is probably the}} product of a largely Early Pleistocene radiation aided by climate and habitat changes during the last ice age.

25|$|The main Bulgarian {{advantage}} {{was their}} strong patriotic spirit and high morale, {{as well as}} the feeling among the men that they were fighting for a just cause. The same could not be <b>said</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Serbs. Their king had misled them in his manifesto to the army, telling the Serbian soldiers that they were being sent to help the Bulgarians in their war against Turkey, and the Serbian soldiers were initially surprised to find that they were fighting Bulgarians instead. Presumably, lying to his army was King Milan's only means to mobilise and command his troops without experiencing disobedience and unrest.|$|E
25|$|This {{definition}} {{applies to}} a Banach space, {{but of course}} other types of space exist as well, for example, topological vector spaces include Banach spaces, but can be more general. On the other hand, Banach spaces include Hilbert spaces, and it is these spaces that find the greatest application and the richest theoretical results. With suitable restrictions, much can be <b>said</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> structure of the spectra of transformations in a Hilbert space. In particular, for self-adjoint operators, the spectrum lies on the real line and (in general) is a spectral combination of a point spectrum of discrete eigenvalues and a continuous spectrum.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the king}} {{repeated}} his invitation to Casaubon {{to settle in}} Paris, {{and gave him a}} pension. No more was <b>said</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> university. The recent reform of the University of Paris closed its doors to all but Catholics; and though the chairs of the Collège de France were not governed by the statutes of the university, public opinion ran so violently against Protestants, that Henry IV dared not appoint a Calvinist to that position. When the king's sub-librarian Jean Gosselin died of extreme old age in 1604, Casaubon succeeded him, with a salary of 400 livres in addition to his pension.|$|E
25|$|The Sierra Club, The Humane Society, and the Eco-Justice Program {{have all}} officially {{endorsed}} the Green Bible. Reaction to the Green Bible among Christian leaders has been mixed. Some leaders have praised {{the concept of}} the Green Bible, but have raised issues with how some content is presented, stating that the environmental message deemphasizes the Bible’s central message of the Gospels. Richard Land, head of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission <b>said</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> edition: “Sure it's important, but when they asked Jesus what was most important, he said, 'Love your God, and love your neighbor as yourself.'

25|$|Gender inequality, however, is not {{increasing}} or decreasing in a collinear fashion among these predominantly Muslim states. In Afghanistan, for example, gender inequality, {{as measured by}} the index, improved by 2% from 2005 to 2008 but then declined by 2% from 2008 to 2011. In Iraq, the GII score jumped by 9% from 2005 to 2008 but then leveled off in 2011. Turkey, Indonesia, Tunisia, and Pakistan have seen consistent improves to gender equality since 2005. Due to the broad, general nature of the indicators, the minimal and narrow data used to compile the three categories which compose the indicator, and innumerable political and socio-economic issues which may increase or decrease gender inequality, nothing definitive can be <b>said</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> level of gender inequality or its growth trend in many predominantly Muslim nations.|$|E

25|$|In 2003 TCB, a band {{based in}} the Washington area, created a spinoff sound from go-go called bounce beat. Bounce beat is a heavier version of its {{ancestor}} that relies on timbales, drums, keyboards and bass to form its signature sound. At a time when bands like Backyard, UnCalled 4, and Raw Image were moving the genre toward a more driving sound by using a more forceful “breakdown” beat, bounce beat seems, in retrospect, like a natural progression. Still, the music was initially dismissed by all but a core of believers. It took fans time to realize TCB’s innovation wasn’t a rejection of “traditional” go-go, but a shift. Instead of paying homage to the genre’s early greats by copying their style, bounce beat built on a strong foundation and showed that the music still had more ideas to explore, limited only by percussive innovation and imagination. Fans of bounce beat, like the sound itself, tend to be much younger than the traditional go-go crowd. The rototom-dependent subgenre was initially maligned—some called it “noise,” others argued that it wasn’t go-go at all. Criticism of bounce beat was similar to what was <b>said</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> trap rap bubbling in other cities around the same time: It was blasted for its sometimes suggestive lyrics, its thwacking beat, its tempos that vacillated between syrupy and frenetic. But over time, bounce beat made inroads.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the Phenomena is to give an {{introduction}} to the constellations, with the rules for their risings and settings; and of the circles of the sphere, amongst which the Milky Way is reckoned. The positions of the constellations, north of the ecliptic, are described by reference to the principal groups surrounding the north pole (Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Draco, and Cepheus), whilst Orion serves as a point of departure for those to the south. The immobility of the earth, and the revolution of the sky about a fixed axis are maintained; the path of the sun in the zodiac is described; but the planets are introduced merely as bodies having a motion of their own, without any attempt to define their periods; nor is anything <b>said</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> moon's orbit. The opening of the poem asserts the dependence of all things upon Zeus. From the lack of precision in the descriptions, it would seem that Aratus was neither a mathematician nor observer or, at any rate, that in this work he did not aim at scientific accuracy. He not only represents the configurations of particular groups incorrectly, but describes some phenomena which are inconsistent with any one supposed latitude of the spectator, and others which could not coexist at any one epoch. These errors are partly to be attributed to Eudoxus himself, and partly {{to the way in which}} Aratus has used the materials supplied by him. Hipparchus (about a century later), who was a scientific astronomer and observer, has left a commentary upon the Phenomenas of Eudoxus and Aratus, accompanied by the discrepancies which he had noticed between his own observations and their descriptions.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{actively}} {{participating in}} the current discussions on evolutionary theory and genetics, Mosterín has also tackled issues like the definition of life itself or the ontology of biological organisms and species. Following in Aristotle’s and Schrödinger’s footsteps, he has been asking the simple question: what is life? He has analyzed the main proposed definitions, based on metabolism, reproduction, thermodynamics, complexity and evolution, and found all of them wanting. It is true that all organisms on Earth share many characteristics, from the encoding of genetic information in DNA to the storage of energy in ATP, but these common features merely reflect the inheritance from a common ancestor that possibly acquired them in a random way. From that point of view, our biology is the parochial science of life on Earth, rather than a universal science of life in general. Such a general biology seems impossible, {{as long as we}} do not detect and come to know other forms of life in the galaxy (if they exist). Concerning the ontological thesis of Michael Ghiselin and David Hull on the individuality of biological species, Mosterín shows that they are neither classes nor individuals in the usual meaning of these words. He tries to extend and make more precise the available conceptual framework of the discussion. Specifically, he shows the formal equivalence of the set-theoretical and the mereological (or part and individual) approach, so that everything that can be <b>said</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> classes can be translated into the jargon of individuals, and the other way around. All these concerns converge in his recent philosophy of animality, which combines the ontology of animals as paradigmatic individuals with the insights and results of biological research. This general theory of animals provides a solid foundation for the development of anthropology, conceived as the science of human primates.|$|E
