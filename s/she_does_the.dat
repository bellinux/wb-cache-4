5|$|Mulder, Scully, Asekoff, and Fazekas are rescued, {{but there}} is no sign of Glaser or the other {{creature}}. Upon leaving the forest, Mulder states that the creature may, in fact, be an evolved version of the first Spanish conquistadors who had first settled in the forest 450 years before. Although Kinsley finds it ridiculous, Mulder believes that centuries of seclusion could be adequate for such drastic adaptations to happen. Afterwards, Mulder realizes that the creatures presume others' presence in their territory as threatening and rushes to the hotel room where Scully is packing her things. After ascertaining that she is finished packing, he firmly urges her to vacate the room, which <b>she</b> <b>does.</b> <b>The</b> camera then pans under the bed where a pair of red eyes open.|$|E
5|$|After a long chase, the Flying Monkeys {{succeed in}} {{capturing}} their targets {{and bring them}} back to Evillene. Vengeful for Dorothy having killed her sister, she dismembers the Scarecrow, flattens the Tin Man, and tortures the Lion in hopes of making Dorothy give her the silver shoes. When she threatens to throw Toto into a fiery cauldron, Dorothy nearly gives in until the Scarecrow hints to her to activate a fire sprinkler switch, which <b>she</b> <b>does.</b> <b>The</b> sprinklers put out the fire but also melt Evillene. She is flushed down into her throne, the lid of which slams shut like a toilet. With Evillene finally gone, her spells lose their power: the Winkies are freed from their permanent costumes (revealing attractive humans underneath) and their sweatshop tools disappear. They rejoice in dance and praise Dorothy as their emancipator. The Flying Monkeys give her and her friends a triumphant ride back to the Emerald City.|$|E
5|$|A human {{going into}} an ala’s house, which is {{frequently}} {{deep in a}} forest, but may also be in the clouds, in a lake, spring, cave, gigantic tree, or other hidden remote place, or on an inhospitable mountain, can have varied consequences. If he approaches the ala with an appeal, and does not mention the differences between her and humans, he will be rewarded. Otherwise, he will be cruelly punished. According to one story, a stepdaughter, driven away from home by her stepmother, comes to an ala’s house; addresses her with the word mother; picks lice from the ala’s hair full of worms; and feeds the ala’s “livestock” of owls, wolves, badgers, and other wild animals; behaving and talking as if these things are quite normal to her, and is rewarded by the ala with a chest filled with gold. When the stepmother’s daughter comes to the ala’s house, <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> opposite, and the ala punishes her and her mother by sending them a chest of snakes, which blind them. In another example, when a prince asks an ala for her daughter’s hand, she saves him from other ale, and helps him get married. But when a girl to whom an ala is the godmother visits the ala with her mother, the ala eats them both because the mother talked about the strange things in her house.|$|E

25|$|According to {{economist}} David Foot of the University of Toronto, {{the level}} of a woman's education is {{the most important factor in}} determining whether she will reproduce: the higher her level of education, the less likely she is to bear children (or if <b>she</b> <b>does,</b> <b>the</b> fewer children she is likely to have). Overall, researchers have observed childless couples to be more educated, and it is perhaps because of this that they are more likely to be employed in professional and management occupations, more likely for both spouses to earn relatively high incomes, and to live in urban areas. They are also less likely to be religious, subscribe to traditional gender roles, or subscribe to conventional roles.|$|E

25|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} {{the members of}} The Dells, who recorded both the single featured in the music video and the version featured in the movie. In the music video the group is seen in a music video recording their song, interrupted by flashbacks including clips from the movie and album covers from both the Dells and the fictional group The Five Heartbeats. One of the flashbacks shows the lead singer singing and cleaning with a woman and then spontaneously stripping off his clothes as <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> same. Although black and white clips are shown of the fictional Five Heartbeats, none of the choreography is featured. Instead the audience witnesses an aged appearance of the Dells who stand still while singing the song and attempt to imitate the clapping and snapping portrayed in the movie.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Sindhu {{really has}} fallen for JKB {{and both of}} them get {{intimate}} with each other. One day, JKB is caught coming out of Sindhu's apartment by Bhairavi. Sindhu is seen as the home wrecker and is forced to quit her association with JKB. He pines for her and leans on alcohol for support, which sadly leads to his downward spiral ending in an embarrassing barter of his musical knowledge for a drink. He even steals money from Bhairavi's grandfather, which leads to his death. Sindhu reenters his life and brings him around, however she has a secret of her own, the secret of her pregnancy. After Sindhu brings back JKB from his alcoholic state, JKB's friends pressurize Sindhu to leave the town and to never come back, which <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> very next day. Both Bhairavi and JKB are distraught as Bhairavi had agreed to marry Sindhu to JKB.|$|E

25|$|Grant’s gazelles {{sexually mature}} at 18 months. Territory-holding bucks mate more than ones in {{bachelor}} groups. The courting ritual {{begins with a}} buck following a doe, {{waiting for her to}} urinate. When <b>she</b> <b>does,</b> <b>the</b> male does the Flehmen response to determine if she is in estrus. If she is, he will continue to follow her. The female will lift her tail, signaling she is ready to mate, and the male will mount her. The gestation period for the gazelle lasts for 198 days. Births peak in January and February. A doe will leave her herd and find a well-hidden place to give birth. Afterwards, the female eats the afterbirth and other fluids to keep the fawn clean and scentless. Females that have recently given birth will stay together for protection. The does nurse their fawns four times a day. Fawns are immobile for the first few days, so the mother stays close by. When the fawn can walk, it leaves with its mother to find a herd. Around this time, fawns will associate with one another in peer groups. A gazelle is weaned at six months, but will continue to associate with its mother until adolescence.|$|E
500|$|... "Coming of Age" [...] {{examines}} {{themes of}} growing into adulthood, {{as well as}} ideas of gender and sexuality. In deliberate contrast to The Left Hand of Darkness, Le Guin's previous work which was set on the same fictional planet, Le Guin uses feminine pronouns for all the Gethenians {{when they are not}} in kemmer, and uses male or female pronouns for individuals in kemmer, depending on what sex they take on. <b>She</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> same in [...] "Winter's King", another short story set on Gethen and written many years after [...] "Left Hand". In addition, first-person narration discusses the difficulty of telling a story about people without fixed male or female characteristics, in a language that only has gendered pronouns.|$|E

[...] The BBC Holby City homepage describes Maddy as: [...] "enthusiastic and eager to learn. Being with her is fun. She doesn't moan, she loves her job and gets on with it.

500|$|Mr. Burns wants Marge {{to paint}} his {{portrait}} for the Burns Wing of the Springfield Art Museum.

While Mr. Burns heckles Marge as <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> painting, Homer finds out that he has lost 21 pounds from his exercise regimen and now weighs 239.

After working {{until well into the}} night, she finishes the painting and then it is unveiled {{at the opening of the}} Burns Wing. The painting depicts a naked, frail, and weak Mr. Burns. The people are shocked, until Marge explains that it depicts what Mr. Burns actually is: a vulnerable human being who will, one day, be no more. Mr. Burns is outraged at first, but then, like everyone else, accepts his new glory, praises Marge's painting and thanks Marge [...] "for not making fun of [...] genitalia", to which Marge replies, [...] "I thought I did." ...|$|E

2500|$|I brought Beyoncé {{a number}} of {{references}} and we picked some out together. Most were German modern-dance references, believe it or not. But it really evolved.
