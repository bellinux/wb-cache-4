Kizirian's unit had fought its way to the crest of a hill and dug in. Kizirian was standing watch at the company command post inside an Okinawa burial ground. When replacements joined the company, many Japanese soldiers harassed the lines by infiltrating the positions of the more inexperienced soldiers. Kizirian ordered that flares <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> at irregular intervals to would illuminate the scene and distract the enemy. The idea proved successful and the newly arrived Marines soon had the situation under control.|$|E
5|$|Each season, {{competitors}} are progressively eliminated {{based on their}} performance during an assigned task. After each task, the winning team receives a reward, while the losing team faces a boardroom showdown {{in order to determine}} which team member <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired,</b> and therefore eliminated from the show. Trump hires one of the finalists to be his apprentice. Starting with season7, celebrities participated as a way to revitalize the series, with the winners donating their proceeds to charity. Trump departed the series after the fourteenth season to focus on his 2016 presidential campaign, in which actor and politician Arnold Schwarzenegger would now serve as host of the series.

500|$|Work was {{interrupted}} {{for most of}} 1972 {{in order to work}} on Lou Reizner's orchestral version of Tommy. Daltrey finished his first solo album, which included the hit single [...] "Giving It All Away", fueling rumours of a split in the press.

500|$|Just {{prior to}} the release of Ballad of Easy Rider, the Byrds {{underwent}} yet another change in personnel when bassist John York was asked to leave the band in September 1969. [...] York had become disenchanted with his role in the Byrds and had voiced his reluctance to perform material that had been written and recorded by the group before he had joined. [...] The rest of the band had begun to doubt his commitment and so, a consensus was reached among the other three members that York <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired.</b> [...] He was replaced, at the suggestion of Parsons and White, by Skip Battin, a freelance session musician and one-time member of the duo Skip & Flip. [...] Battin's recruitment marked the last personnel change to the group for almost three years and as a result, the McGuinn‚ÄìWhite‚ÄìParsons‚ÄìBattin line-up became the most stable and longest-lived of any configuration of the Byrds.|$|E
5000|$|On You're Fired, {{both the}} panel and the {{audience}} disagreed with David's firing, with the panellists all feeling that Gary <b>should</b> have <b>been</b> <b>fired</b> instead for being a poor leader despite his field of experience.|$|R

500|$|AllMusic's Phil Freeman {{said that}} the album, which he gave 4 out of 5 stars, was well worth the wait after {{the amount of time}} it took to get released, and that the stylistic variety of material, {{combined}} with the cover art (which bore a striking resemblance to that of The Resistance, also released that year), could make Priestess [...] "retro hard rock's answer to Muse". Rock Sound made a favorable comparison to Thin Lizzy for the track [...] "Lunar", and to Baroness for [...] "The Gem", giving the album a score of 9 out of 10. The PRP described the album as [...] "heavier" [...] than Hello Master, with its songs having [...] "an alarming amount of depth", but referred to the track [...] "Murphy's Law" [...] as [...] "questionable" [...] in an otherwise favorable review which gave the album 4 out of 5 stars. Artrocker's Stuart Gadd also gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, as he enjoyed the stylistic reminders of Iron Maiden and other classic metal he heard on the album, and went as {{far as to say that}} despite being released in early 2010 it was already the best metal record of the year. David Marchese, writing for Spin, also praised the album with a score of 8 out of 10, even saying that [...] "Someone <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> for the delay , because this baby burns".|$|E
500|$|Stone gave Charlie Sheen {{the choice}} of Jack Lemmon or Martin Sheen to play his father in the film, and Sheen picked his father. The elder Sheen related to the moral sense of his character. Stone cast Daryl Hannah as Bud Fox's materialistic girlfriend Darien Taylor, but {{felt that she was}} never happy with the role and did not know why she {{accepted}} it. He tried to explain the character to Hannah repeatedly, and thought that the materialism of the character conflicted with Hannah's idealism. Stone said later that he was aware early on that she was not right for the part. [...] "Daryl Hannah was not happy doing the role and I should have let her go. All my crew {{wanted to get rid of}} her after one day of shooting. My pride was such that I kept saying I was going to make it work". Stone also had difficulties with Sean Young, who made her opinions known that Hannah <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> and that she should play that role instead. Young would show up to the set late and unprepared. She did not get along with Charlie Sheen, which caused further friction on the set. In retrospect, Stone felt that Young was right and he should have swapped Hannah's role with hers. Stone admits that he had [...] "some problems" [...] with Young, but was not willing to confirm or deny rumors that she walked off with all of her costumes when she completed filming.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} The Office website {{included three}} cut scenes from [...] "Golden Ticket". One 72-second clip includes Michael eavesdropping from the men's bathroom on Angela, Oscar, Kelly and Meredith, who discuss how unfair Michael is treating Dwight in making him take the fall over the failed golden ticket promotion. Kelly {{also makes the}} remark, [...] "I hope Dwight gets fired and they get a hot new guy to replace him," [...] to which Oscar replies, [...] "Seriously." [...] In another 52-second scene, Michael asks Dwight {{to go on a}} stroll, but Dwight suggests turning it into a [...] "power stroll", which he prepares Michael for by applying sunscreen to his face. And in a follow-up to the scene where workers discuss that Michael <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired,</b> a visibly angry and upset Michael confronts the office. When he says [...] "Can any of you imagine this office without me?" [...] everyone gleefully raises their hands, but Michael then asks them if they've thought about what kind of terrible person they could get to replace him; he then pointedly says that they could get someone who knows they don't actually need three accountants (Oscar, Kevin, and Angela look visibly ashamed that Michael knew this going back to Season 2's Halloween episode but has never taken any action about it) or someone who doesn't approve of romantic relationships and would transfer one or both people having one to separate branches (Jim and Pam in turn get this message and look thoughtful), and tells the office that they should mind what they're saying about him [...] "when I'm hiding in the bathroom pretending to be pooping." ...|$|E
