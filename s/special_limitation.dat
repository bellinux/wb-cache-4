There is here abundant evidence that there exists some strange misconception of the scope of the provision as found in the fourteenth amendment.

40|$|The 2002 Ipp Review of the Law of Negligence {{recommended}} {{the enactment of}} a <b>special</b> <b>limitation</b> period for the commencement of personal injuries litigation in cases where a child is injured by a parent or {{a person who is}} in a 'close relationship' with the child’s parent. A person would be in such a relationship with a child’s parent if he or she had a relationship with the child's parent, such that the child's parent might be influenced not to bring an action on the child's behalf (the first limb of the definition); or, if the person's relationship with the child's parent was such that the child might be unwilling to disclose the relevant acts (the second limb of the definition). In recommending this <b>special</b> <b>limitation</b> period, the Ipp Report appeared to acknowledge features of some classes of child abuse cases which make a standard personal injuries limitation period unjustifiable. Following this recommendation, New South Wales and Victoria enacted legislative changes which aim to give survivors of child abuse perpetrated by a parent or a person classed as a 'close associate' of a parent a justifiable period of time in which to institute personal injuries proceedings. This article discusses the Ipp Report's recommendations regarding the <b>special</b> <b>limitation</b> period and the reasons given for those recommendations, which are largely motivated by psychological evidence concerning the effects of child abuse. It then outlines the legislative provisions in New South Wales and Victoria, which embody the essence of the Ipp recommendations. The article then consults evidence of the psychological effects of child sexual abuse, and studies of non-disclosure and delayed disclosure by survivors of child sexual abuse, to inform an assessment of the conceptual basis of the second limb of the close associate provision. Using the psychological evidence and empirical evidence of disclosure and non-disclosure as analytical tools, this article will argue that the second limb of the close associate provision would be better predicated not on the tortfeasor's perceived relationship with the child’s parent, but {{on the nature of the}} acts and circumstances of abuse and their impact on the child's willingness to disclose their abuse. The article is of particular relevance to New South Wales and Victoria, but, given the desirability and likelihood of other Australian jurisdictions enacting a <b>special</b> <b>limitation</b> period for child abuse cases, it is also relevant to the rest of Australia...|$|E

40|$|A {{measurement}} {{was made}} in a street canyon with street trees (Abelia grandiflorarehd and Populus nigra.), which were planted along National Route 3 (Route 3), an asphalt- made road, in order to study inhibitive effects of street trees on surface temperature of urban area. The measurement was performed from June 1 to 2 in 1995, in Fukuoka, Japan. In this area Abelias are planted densely along both side of the road, trimmed in rectangular shape {{at the height of}} about 120 cm, while 7 m high Poplars are planted inside the bush of Abelias at intervals of 9 m. A thermal imagery thermometer was used to study characteristics of the distribution of surface temperatures in the street. The results obtained through the measurement and data analysis can be summarized as follows: 1) The shadow of tall and foliaged street trees projected on the surface of asphalt road had remarkable inhibitive effects on surface temperature. For example, the surface temperatures were 24 ℃ in the shadow of Poplar’s tree, and 40 ℃ outside of the shadow at 13 : 30. 2) In contrast to the marked temperature increasing on the road in urban area, street trees keep lower surface temperatures. In other word, the street trees perform cooling functions by transpiration and decreasing functions of heat island in urban area. 3) The effect of tall and heavy foliaged street trees were better than the short one in improving heat environment during daytime in urban area. 4) On the dried surface of asphalt road which is without functions of changing sensible heat into latent heat, the increasing rate of its surface temperature was twice of air temperature and 2. 2 - 2. 5 times of Poplar and Abelia. 5) The heat radiated from the part of asphalt road which had been under the shadow decreased to be about 80 % of that from the sunny part of road during the daytime. From the stand point of road view, it is good for the road to plant some short trees like Abelia along it, but their meteorological effect can not be equal to the tall and foliaged trees. Of course, we should think over traffic safety and classes of road. If there is no <b>special</b> <b>limitation</b> on the type of tree, choosing tall and foliaged trees are recommended. On the other hand, the 9 m intervals of Poplar’s trees like Route 3 is too wide to cover the road surface with shadow. The method of arrangement of tall street trees is an important problem and should be researched from now on. 人間の生産, 生活活動が都市に集中するにつれて, 都市におけるエネルギー消費の増大, 建築物の高密度化と高層化, 路面および地面被覆のコンクリート・アスファルト化が進む一方で, 都市の植生や水域が激減し, 都市域の表面は熱を吸収しやすく, 熱を放出しにくい構造にかわり, 都市の熱環境は悪化しつつある(日野, 1992). このような状況を食い止め, 都市に自立的, 安定的な生態系循環を取り戻し, 良好な都市環境を形成するために, 都市のなかに自然を保全・創出し, 生態系に準じたシステムを構築する提案が出されている(加藤, 1990; 森口, 1990). このような働きの中で, 都市域の熱環境の質的改善策の一つとして, 植物による都市気象の緩和に関する研究は多くなってきた(神田・日野, 1990; 清田ら, 1995). しかし, これらの研究の中で, 街路樹による気象緩和機能に関する研究は比較的少ない. 都市域内の植物は主に公園植物, 街路植物, 市民庭園植物, 景観植物および農林植物などの形で都市域内に分布している. 本研究では, 都市域内植物の構成要因の一つである街路樹を対象に観測を行い, その気象緩和機能の実証を試みた...|$|E

She invoked the limiting language of the most expansive interpretations of the Commerce Clause in the Court's decisions of the 1930s and 1940s to argue that the Court retained the power to decide whether a particular exercise of the Commerce Clause authority was necessary and proper to the federal purposes to be achieved.

40|$|AbstractThe {{notion of}} joint actions {{provides}} a natural execution {{model for a}} specification language, when temporal logic of actions is used for formal reasoning.

This is done in a way that agrees with the partial-order view of computations and can be applied already {{in the early stages of}} specification and design. This leads to distinguishing between schedulings that are totally correct, partially correct, or incorrect with respect to liveness properties. A general scheduling policy of durational actions is formulated from which any reasonable scheduling can be obtained by reducing its nondeterminism. When this policy is totally correct for a system and gives the required real-time properties, no <b>special</b> <b>limitations</b> are imposed on the implementation.

40|$|Extended {{abstract}} 1 - Introduction Developing {{the cities}} and it’s influences on the spatial structure of megalopolises {{has always been one}} of the most important factors for the planners. Among the most important factors directing the development of the cities, are natural factors such as climatic ones which have been less considered in the country as yet because of various factors like economic benefits resulting from immethodical construction of the buildings. Since this carelessness has caused an unwise and easy-going development of Tehran megalopolis in unsuitable geographic directions, so this research intends to accomplish the optimum site selection for physical development of Tehran megalopolis based on climatic elements and geographic factors. 2 - MethodologyTopographic maps of the region which mainly consist some parts of Tehran and Alborz provinces on a scale of 1 : 250, 000 were prepared and the region boundary was defined on them. In the next step, the climatic data of six meteorological stations was taken from the Iranian Meteorological Organization and, after reconstruction, was considered through the similar time range of 1984 to 2005. Then, using ArcGIS software and on the basis of the climatic and geographic factors, various layers affecting the site selection including topography, digital elevation model (DEM), slope percent and aspect, solar radiation angle, temperature means (minimum, maximum and daily), mean diurnal temperature difference, 24 hrs. maximum precipitation, and mean wind speed were made and entered into the software. Pixels’ values in the climatic layers were calculated via spline interpolation method or regression equations. Then the resulted raster layers, after the reclassification of their pixels’ values, were weighed and overlayed using Spatial Analyst (SA) and Spatial Analytical Hierarchy Process (SAHP) models and thus the final maps of the physical development suitability of these two models were obtained. On the other hand, two Landsat ETM- 7 images prepared from Iranian Space Agency and some geometric corrections were made on them using PCI (Geomatica) software in UTM WGS 84 projection. Before geometric corrections, because of temporal differences of images, radiometric corrections were made on them too. radiometric correction or normalization means the reconstruction of image values so that there is a linear and similar relation between pixels and their real radiations in the whole imaging area. The result was the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) map and the land use map. As the last step, the final site selection maps were presented via overlaying the NDVI and the land use maps with final maps of each two SA and SAHP models. 3 – DiscussionBased upon the distribution of the development suitability zones in the site selection maps, the most unfavorable areas have been developed in the high slope sections of the north of the region in the SA model. According to this model, about 8500 km 2 of the region has not any <b>special</b> <b>limitation</b> for the development. In the SAHP model too, the most important limitation in the way of the development is the high slope sections of north of the region. The most suitable areas with almost 1400 km 2 area stands in the south, west and the submontanes of north and northwest of the region. Partly suitable areas with the area equal to 5300 km 2 have been developed in the central and southern parts of the region. The comparison of the final maps of two models reveals that the most suitable areas in the SAHP model have lesser extent than in the SA model. 4 – ConclusionConsidering the bare land expansion which is mainly developed in the south of region and overlaying it with suitability zones of the SA and SAHP models and in order to protect the vegetation cover specially in the western parts of the region, among the three suitable zones for physical development of the city, the south direction is the most favorable direction and the western and southwestern regions respectively stand in the next precedences. In order to get a more comprehensive study in this regard, the other natural factors such as geologic, geomorphologic, hydrologic and human factors must be taken into account too.

These solutions are: 10 % nitric acid, 10 % citric acid, 10 % sodium hydroxide [...] 2. 5 % tartaric acid, 10 % oxalic acid, 0. 003 M periodic acid in 0. 05 M nitric acid, 3 % sodium fluoride [...] 20 % nitric acid, Turco 4501 and Turco 4502, and 0. 25 M phosphoric acid. Boron stainless steel type 304 L was studied in 10 % sodium hydroxide [...] 2. 5 % tartaric acid, 10 and 60 % nitric acids, Turco 4501 and Turco 4502. The two austenitic stainless steels {{were found to be}} acceptable construction materials for handling each of the decontamination solutions except 3 % sodium fluoride [...] 20 % nitric acid. <b>Special</b> <b>limitations</b> are defined for Monel, titanium 55 A, and tantalum when exposed to decontamination reagents.

40|$|Abstract—To {{mitigate}} the threat of malware intrusions on networked embedded systems, it is desirable to provide remote attestation assurances for them. Embedded systems have <b>special</b> <b>limitations</b> concerning cost, power efficiency, computation, and memory that influence how this goal can be achieved. Moreover, many types of applications require integrity guarantees for the system over an interval of time rather than just at a given instant. We propose a Cumulative Attestation Kernel (CAK) that addresses these concerns. We demonstrate the value of CAKs for Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and show how to implement a CAK in less than {{one quarter of the}} memory available on low end flash MCUs similar to those used in AMI deployments. Regarding this prototype, we present the first formal proof we are aware of that a system is tolerant to power supply interruptions. We also discuss how to provide cumulative attestation for devices with tighter memory constraints by offloading computation and storage onto a Cumulative Attestation Coprocessor (CAC).

5000|$|A laicized cleric loses {{rights to}} {{such things as}} {{clerical}} garb and titles (such as [...] "Father"). He is freed from obligations such as recitation of the Liturgy of the Hours, but like {{any member of the}} laity is encouraged, though not obliged, to continue to recite it. The rescript of laicization for a deacon normally contains no <b>special</b> <b>limitations,</b> but that for a priest does prohibit him from delivering a homily (the sermon preached at Mass after proclamation of the Gospel reading, not preaching in general), acting as extraordinary minister of Holy Communion, having a directive office in the pastoral field, or having any function in a seminary or similar institution. It imposes restrictions also regarding the holding of teaching or administration posts in schools and universities. Some of these limitations may be relaxed according to the judgment of the local bishop including the teaching of theology in schools or universities (both Catholic and non-Catholic), maintaining contact with the parish where the priest used to serve, and administering the Eucharist.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{accuracy}} of the data registered in synoptic stations has {{a pivotal role in}} production of databases and analysis of climatologic and environmental conditions of various regions. Establishment of such stations has <b>special</b> <b>limitations</b> due to their significance in production of information which can be generalized in synoptic scale. Appropriate in this research, places have been proposed for the foundation of such installations in Khorramabad Basin with regard to the propounded confinements of the world meteorological organization. Then the extant stations were matched with ordinary criteria. Geographic information system techniques were utilized for overlapping of diverse information layers and production of the final location map. Fuzzy standardization method and analytical hierarchic process weighing methods were availed for effectuation of the objectives in question. The eventual location layer was engendered at the end by commingling of the different standardized layers based upon their particular weight. Optimized spots were introduced for the establishment of synoptic stations. According to the effectuated examinations and the intermingling of the layers required for location of synoptic stations, the pertinent upshots evince that the distribution of synoptic stations in Khorramabad Basin does not match the standards set down by the world meteorological organization...|$|R
