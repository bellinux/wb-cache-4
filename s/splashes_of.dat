5|$|SS-Untersturmführer (second lieutenant) Amon Göth {{arrives in}} Kraków to oversee {{construction}} of Płaszów concentration camp. When {{the camp is}} completed, he orders the ghetto liquidated. Many people are shot and killed {{in the process of}} emptying the ghetto. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a tiny girl in a red coat – one of the few <b>splashes</b> <b>of</b> color in the black-and-white film – as she hides from the Nazis, and later sees her body (identifiable by the red coat) among those on a wagon load of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Göth and, through bribery and lavish gifts, continues to enjoy SS support. Göth brutally mistreats his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa, and the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp.|$|E
5|$|To {{reach the}} chapel's ceiling, Michelangelo {{designed}} his own scaffold, a flat wooden platform on brackets built out from {{holes in the}} wall {{near the top of}} the windows, rather than being built up from the floor. Mancinelli speculates that this was in order to cut the cost of timber. According to Michelangelo's pupil and biographer Ascanio Condivi, the brackets and frame that supported the steps and flooring were all put in place at the beginning of the work and a lightweight screen, possibly cloth, was suspended beneath them to catch plaster drips, dust, and <b>splashes</b> <b>of</b> paint. Only half the building was scaffolded at a time and the platform was moved as the painting was done in stages. The areas of the wall covered by the scaffolding still appear as unpainted areas across the bottom of the lunettes. The holes were re-used to hold scaffolding in the latest restoration.|$|E
25|$|On 6 April 2013, ICC {{unveiled}} the logo {{of the tournament}} at a gala event in Dhaka. The overall look of the logo design is primarily inspired by the unique Bangladesh decoration art style. The logo uses the colours of the Bangladeshi flag with <b>splashes</b> <b>of</b> blue representing the country's rivers (also as being the ICC's own colour). The logo is also inspired by the rickshaws. The T {{is made up of}} cricket stumps and the '0' in the T20 represents the cricket ball complete with a green seam.|$|E

60|$|Into {{the rhythm}} of his work there came a pulse and a steadied purpose. He stooped, he lifted the weight, he heaved it towards her, setting it as in her, under the moonlit space. And he went back for more. Ever with {{increasing}} closeness he lifted the sheaves and swung striding to the centre with them, ever he drove her more nearly to the meeting, ever he did his share, and drew towards her, overtaking her. There was only the moving to and fro in the moonlight, engrossed, the swinging in the silence, that was marked only by the <b>splash</b> <b>of</b> sheaves, and silence, and a <b>splash</b> <b>of</b> sheaves. And ever the <b>splash</b> <b>of</b> his sheaves broke swifter, beating up to hers, and ever the <b>splash</b> <b>of</b> her sheaves recurred monotonously, unchanging, and ever the <b>splash</b> <b>of</b> his sheaves beat nearer.|$|R
25|$|The company {{continued}} to carefully review submitted titles, giving them scores using a 40-point scale and allocating Nintendo's marketing resources accordingly. Each region performed separate evaluations. Nintendo of America also maintained a policy that, among other things, limited {{the amount of}} violence in the games on its systems. One game, Mortal Kombat, would challenge this policy. A surprise hit in arcades in 1992, Mortal Kombat features <b>splashes</b> <b>of</b> blood and finishing moves that often depict one character dismembering the other. Because the Genesis version retained the gore while the SNES version did not, it outsold the SNES version by a ratio of three or four-to-one.|$|E
25|$|The liquid used in Snap-dragon was {{typically}} brandy, although similar flammable liquors {{could also be}} used. Traditionally, raisins were the treat to be snatched; William Sandys specifies Málaga raisins. Other treats, however, could also be used. Of these, almonds were the most common alternative or addition, but currants, candied fruit, figs, grapes, and plums also featured. Salt could also be sprinkled in the bowl. The low bowl {{was typically}} placed {{in the middle of}} a table to prevent damage from the inevitable <b>splashes</b> <b>of</b> burning brandy. In one variation a Christmas pudding is placed in the centre of the bowl with raisins around it.|$|E

500|$|The {{visual effects}} and slow-motion {{sequences}} induced by Slo-Mo received broad praise. Berkshire {{said that they}} are notable and eye-catching with [...] "impressively utilised 3d." [...] Hewitt said the visuals were [...] "genuinely surreal <b>splashes</b> <b>of</b> heightened colour that...don't outstay their welcome. The film's use of 3D is often excellent (including the credits) and it really comes {{to life in the}} Slo-mo scenes". Dalton said the film [...] "constantly impresses on a visual level, with a gritty style more akin to cult hits like District 9 or 28 Days Later than to standard Hollywood comic-book blockbusters." [...] Dalton said, [...] " [...] first venture into 3D is a blaze of saturated colours, gorgeous high-resolution close-ups and dazzling slow-motion sequences." [...] Dredd won The Art of 3D award at the 2013 Empire Awards, and was nominated for Best British Film and Best Science-fiction/Fantasy.|$|E
500|$|Larry Flick of Billboard said [...] "Power", {{the opening}} track, [...] "finds front man Sascha Konietzko snarling and {{growling}} with palpable force, while Cheryl Wilson softens the edges with <b>splashes</b> <b>of</b> soul-mama vamping during the chorus." [...] Williams called the song [...] "irresistible". Masuo noted {{in particular the}} use of horns and the Hammond B3 organ, and concluded by stating, [...] "In their insidiously arty and intellectually sassy music, KMFDM continue to bring diverse elements {{together to create a}} unified whole." [...] Armstrong called [...] "Dogma" [...] a song that crossed over from being industrial to [...] "frightening", while MacDonald described it as [...] "blistering" [...] and Williams said it was [...] "captivating". Armstrong said [...] "Son of a Gun" [...] was the album's [...] "truly explosive track", but Williams thought [...] "Inane" [...] was the best song.|$|E

2500|$|Cindy Babski {{wrote in}} the New York Times that [...] "There was never any doubt about what the inside label would say.

2500|$|In ODI, New Zealand wore Beige {{and brown}} between 1980 World Series Cricket and 1988 World Series Cricket.

2500|$|The glaze is made opaque by the {{presence}} of plant ash and tiny bubbles of gas, which give a lustrous effect. With the whiter body clays pieces may be translucent. [...] The pronounced reddish colour of unglazed areas comes {{from the end of the}} firing, as the heated clay comes in contact with fresh air let into the kiln, and the iron present turns into ferrous oxide. [...] Many pieces have crazing or crackle in the glaze, but much less than in the closely related Guan ware. A technique sometimes found before about 1400 was to add spots or <b>splashes</b> <b>of</b> a mixture rich in iron oxide with an appearance of randomness; these fired a dark brown.|$|E

The diverse housing also includes ornate, imposing terra-cotta clad buildings, immortalized in the movies of early twentieth century Chicago as apartment hotels and boarding houses. Some of these 1920s, Jazz-Age hotels have since been converted to high-end condos and co-ops, adding to the tremendously diverse population of the area.
