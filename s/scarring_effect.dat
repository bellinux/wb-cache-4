30|$|In 2006, {{we observe}} the well {{documented}} <b>scarring</b> <b>effect</b> of previous unemployment durations on unemployment-to-employment labour market transitions. Relative {{to individuals who}} were unemployed for less than three months, those with durations of between 6 to 12  months or more than 12  months had around two-thirds (0.66) and one-third (0.37), respectively, the odds of moving into employment by the following quarter. By 2011, however, we find that previous unemployment duration had no discernible impact on exits to employment. One {{possible explanation for the}} disappearance of the <b>scarring</b> <b>effect</b> is that the magnitude, and indiscriminate nature, of the incidence of both unemployment and long-term unemployment over the period eradicated the value of durations as a quality signal to employers. Alternatively, the rapid rise in the population of long-term unemployed individuals over the recession with high levels of labour market attachment may have led to a structural behavioural shift in the intensity of job-search among long-term claimants which will also have dampened the <b>scarring</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
40|$|According to the {{conventional}} view, recessions improve resource allocation by driving out less productive firms. This paper posits an additional scarring effect: recessions impede the developments of potentially superior firms by destroying them during their infancy. A model is developed to capture both the cleansing and the scarring effects. A key ingredient of the model is that idiosyncratic productivity is not directly observable, but can be learned over time. When calibrated with statistics on entry, exit and productivity differentials, the model suggests that the <b>scarring</b> <b>effect</b> dominates the cleansing effect, and gives rise to lower average productivity during recessions.

40|$|Entering {{the labour}} market during {{recession}} and becoming exposed to unemployment in early career may not only affect {{the establishment of}} youth within the labour market temporarily and in a transitory manner, but may rather lead to long-lasting adverse consequences concerning future job prospects and labour market integration. Persisting consequences of employment instability and unemployment {{have come to be}} known in the literature as <b>scarring</b> <b>effects.</b> Explaining <b>scarring,</b> diverse demand- as well as supply-side mechanisms are thought to be at a play, which are not easily disentangled in their effects. In addition, the empirical investigation of <b>scarring</b> <b>effects</b> is complicated, as causal effects of unemployment on subsequent employment prospects cannot easily be identified. A cross-national comparative investigation of <b>scarring</b> <b>effects</b> is further limited by comparable data availability allowing for a separation of causal effects at an individual level. This working paper considers the complexity concerning the explanation and investigation of <b>scarring</b> <b>effects</b> and sheds some light on the manifold mechanisms underlying scarring. It also deals with the methodological challenges in their investigation. A suggestion is made for a promising approach concerning an internationally comparative investigation of <b>scarring</b> <b>effects</b> of youth unemployment...|$|R
40|$|This {{deliverable}} presents three country {{studies on}} <b>scarring</b> <b>effects</b> of early employment insecurity in the United Kingdom, Poland and Norway. Traditional analysis of <b>scarring</b> <b>effects</b> has favoured {{the analysis of}} the impact of the experience of unemployment on the experience of subsequent unemployment (state dependence) and the monetary costs of previous unemployment in terms of lower subsequent wages (see e. g.

The three present country studies go beyond the traditional analysis of <b>scarring</b> <b>effects</b> in order to better understand the trade-offs experienced by young female and male workers when faced with an insecure labour market integration. With national longitudinal data, original methodological designs and research focus, each study contributes in an original way to the research literature.

This paper uses the first ten waves of the HILDA survey data to investigate the inter-related dynamics of unemployment, low pay and skills under-utilisation in Australia, focussing on differences by gender and educational pathways.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} interactions between resource reallocation, productivity dynamics and business cycles. A theory that combines two driving forces for resource reallocation, learning and creative destruction, is presented to reconcile several empirical findings of gross job flows. The theory suggests a <b>scarring</b> <b>effect,</b> {{in addition to the}} conventional Schumpeterian cleansing effect, of recessions on the allocation efficiency of resources. I argue that while recessions kill off some of the least productive businesses, they also impede the development of potentially good businesses [...] the ones that might have proven to be efficient in the future are cleared out and lose the opportunity to realize their potential. Calibrations of the model using US manufacturing job flows suggest that the <b>scarring</b> <b>effect</b> is likely to dominate the cleansing effect and account for the observed pro-cyclical average productivity...|$|E

40|$|This paper reports an {{analysis}} of micro-data for India that shows a high correlation in infant mortality among siblings. In 13 of 15 states, we identify a causal effect of infant death on the risk of infant death of the subsequent sibling (a <b>scarring</b> <b>effect),</b> after controlling for mother-level heterogeneity. The scarring effects are large, the only other covariate with a similarly large effect being mother’s (secondary or higher) education. The two states in which evidence of scarring is weak are Punjab, the richest, and Kerala, the socially most progressive. The size of the <b>scarring</b> <b>effect</b> depends upon {{the sex of the}} previous child in three states, in a direction consistent with son-preference.

40|$|The <b>scarring</b> <b>effect</b> {{is defined}} as an {{increase}} in the probability of future unemployment spells and the reduction of subsequent wages as the result of joblessness early in one's working years. Many youths get into a rut {{at the beginning of their}} professional careers when they become unemployed, hindering future individual prospects and producing negative consequences for the economy as a whole. Because there is considerable evidence in the United States that early job displacement is followed by a higher risk of subsequent unemployment and lower trajectory for future earnings after re-entry, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of the economic factors that influence the youth unemployment rate in order to reduce the consequences on youths' future outlooks (Arulampalam, Gregg, and Gregory, 2001).

40|$|Recessions often {{coincide}} with intensified restructuring. The conventional Schumpeterian view argues that recessions promote allocative efficiency by driving out less productive firms and freeing resources for more productive uses. This paper proposes that the conventional cleansing effect is offset by a <b>scarring</b> <b>effect.</b> Recessions impede {{the development of}} potentially superior firms, which might put innovations to better uses, but which are destroyed during their infancy, and never realize their potential. A model of industry dynamics that combines Schumpeterian creative destruction with firm learning is developed to capture both the cleansing and scarring effects. Calibrating the model with data from the U. S. manufacturing sector demonstrates that the <b>scarring</b> <b>effect</b> is likely to dominate the cleansing effect, and accounts for the procyclicality of average labor productivity, a phenomenon at odds with conventional cleansing models.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role that recessions play in {{resource}} allocation. The conventional cleansing view, advanced by Schumpeter in 1934, argues that recessions promote more efficient resource allocation by driving out less productive units and freeing up resources for better uses. However, empirical evidence {{is at odds with}} this view: average labor productivity is procyclical, and jobs created during recessions tend to be short-lived. This paper posits an additional "scarring" effect: recessions "scar" the economy by killing off "potentially good firms". By adding learning to a vintage model, I show that as a recession arrives and persists, the reduced profitability limits the scope of learning, makes labor less concentrated on good firms, and thus pulls down average productivity. Calibrating my model using data on job flows from the U. S. manufacturing sector, I find that the <b>scarring</b> <b>effect</b> is likely to dominate the conventional cleansing effect, and can account for the observed pro-cyclical average labor productivityBusiness Cycles, Cleansing Effect, <b>Scarring</b> <b>Effect,</b> Creative Destruction, Learning, Job Flows...|$|E

40|$|Work Package 7 aims at {{understanding}} how early job insecurity can affect an individual’s future career from an employer’s perspective. By paying {{special attention to}} the educational background and gender of the applicants, we plan to investigate how employers interpret young applicants’ job insecurity, for example in the form of unemployment or job-mismatch experiences, during recruitment. The negative effects of such experiences on an individual’s chances of being recruited successfully – so called <b>scarring</b> <b>effects</b> – may further vary depending on economic and institutional contexts such as country-specific economic or political conditions, educational structures or economic sectors. By surveying employers from different sectors, we will examine if and how these <b>scarring</b> <b>effects</b> vary between four different countries: Bulgaria, Greece, Norway and Switzerland. We will apply an innovative methodology {{in the form of an}} employer-sided survey with an integrated multidimensional vignette experiment in order to simulate the impact of multiple factor s on success and failure when young people who experienced job insecurities apply for new jobs. In the present working paper we summarise the major theoretical concepts that have been used to explain the <b>scarring</b> <b>effects</b> that can result from employer behaviour.

Second, it provides an insight into the relation between true state dependence and the business cycle by investigating the role of local unemployment in affecting the persistence of unemployment incidence and by analysing the dynamics of unemployment scarring in the last two decades. Our results support the presence of true state dependence both during the Great Recession and in the other two sub-periods analysed, the early 90 s and early 2000 s. Moreover, we find evidence of a negative association between the <b>scarring</b> <b>effect</b> of unemployment and the business cycle. From a policy perspective, our findings imply that public interventions aimed at alleviating unemployment in the short term are also likely to have beneficial effects on longer term unemployment, especially during downturns...|$|E
30|$|To recapitulate, {{we expect}} OLS to {{overestimate}} the <b>scarring</b> <b>effect</b> of early non-employment on the outcomes if the bias comes from ability.

40|$|The {{vulnerability}} model {{states that}} low self-esteem {{functions as a}} predictor {{for the development of}} depressive symptoms whereas the scar model assumes that these symptoms leave scars in individuals resulting in lower self-esteem. Both models have received empirical support, however, they have only been tested within individuals and not across generations (i. e., between family members). Thus, we tested the scope of these competing models by (a) investigating whether the effects hold from adolescence to middle adulthood (long-term vulnerability and <b>scar</b> <b>effects),</b> (b) whether the effects hold across generations (intergenerational vulnerability and <b>scar</b> <b>effects),</b> and (c) whether intergenerational effects are mediated by parental self-esteem and depressive symptoms and parent–child discord. We used longitudinal data from adolescence to middle adulthood (N = 1, 359) and from Generation 1 adolescents (G 1) to Generation 2 adolescents (G 2) (N = 572 parent–child pairs). Results from latent cross-lagged regression analyses demonstrated that both adolescent self-esteem and depressive symptoms were prospectively related to adult self-esteem and depressive symptoms 3 decades later. That is, both the vulnerability and scar models are valid over decades with stronger effects for the vulnerability model. Across generations, we found a substantial direct transmission effect from G 1 to G 2 adolescent depressive symptoms but no evidence for the proposed intergenerational vulnerability and <b>scar</b> <b>effect</b> or for any of the proposed mediating mechanisms...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} <b>scarring</b> <b>effects</b> more comprehensively, future research is needed {{with regard to the}} mechanisms driving unemployment scarring among (vocationally skilled) young workers and the development of employment scars in the longer run. It is further not exclusively clarified in which way standardised and vocation specific degrees affect unemployment scarring. Where unemployment is less prevalent, one may hypothesise unemployment to be more stigmatising (e.g., Nilsen and Holm Reiso [2011]). Since unemployment rates for young entrants holding standardised vocational degrees are comparatively low, one may for this reason also assume scarring to be more pronounced among VET graduates. In addition, <b>scarring</b> <b>effects</b> among VET graduates may be heterogeneous. Focusing on potential gender differences with respect to scarring our results (not reported in this paper) point in the direction that wage scars are more pronounced among male graduates while differences in career satisfaction are to some extent more distinct among female graduates. However, due to small group sizes, we cannot stably confirm these results and need to leave the investigation of potentially heterogeneous <b>scarring</b> <b>effects</b> among VET graduates for future research. Paying attention to differences in wage growth and unemployment experiences, comparing those who stay with the same employer where they pursued vocational education and those who need to search for a job at a new firm after graduation (see e.g., von Wachter and Bender [2006]), may also allow for further insight in future research.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{structured}} around three empirical analyses, {{which are based}} on bank failures that occurred in the US between 1984 and 2013. The first analysis tests whether financial crises contribute to removing the most inefficient banks from the market and to liberating resources for more efficient use (cleansing effect), or whether they destroy banks regardless of their efficiency (<b>scarring</b> <b>effect).</b> The results show that the nature of bank failures during financial crises are not fully aligned with either a cleansing or a <b>scarring</b> <b>effect.</b> While efficiency helps banks survive over the full sample period, financial crises do not amplify the removal of inefficient institutions. Additional tests show that financial crises contribute to producing a <b>scarring</b> <b>effect</b> via the increase in the failure rate of young banks regardless of their efficiency but also generate a cleansing effect by liberating resources that are more efficiently used by new entry banks. The second set of empirical analyses investigates the long-term post-acquisition performance of failed bank acquirers. The results show that after an acquisition failed bank acquirers’ performance deteriorated significantly, with an exception being the deals completed during the global financial crisis, during which no performance changes were evident. This result is likely caused by the loss-sharing agreements included in most of the latter transactions. Further analysis shows that although no benefit in terms of performance materializes for the acquiring banks, {{they are less likely to}} disappear from the market through either an acquisition or outright failure. The final analysis examines the relation between failed bank resolution costs and the competitive pressures in the market. The results show that when restrictions on competition are relaxed, large (small) targets become more (less) desirable, and the associated costs to resolve them reduce (increase). This finding, however, is merely evident during normal times...|$|E

Borrowing language from the unemployment literature, the causal process is termed state dependence or scarring. To the extent that scarring exists, a social multiplier comes into play, raising the payoff to policies that reduce infant mortality.
