40|$|Human {{herpesvirus}} 6 variant A (HHV- 6 A) {{and human}} herpesvirus 6 variant B (HHV- 6 B) are two closely related yet distinct viruses. These visuses {{belong to the}} Roseolovirus genus of the betaherpesvirus subfamily; they are most closely related to human herpesvirus 7 and then to human cytomegalovirus. Over 95 % of people older than 2 years of age are seropositive for either or both HHV- 6 variants, and current serologic methods are incapable of discriminating infection with one variant from infection with the other. HHV- 6 A has not been etiologically linked to any human disease, but such an association will probably be found soon. HHV- 6 B is the etiologic agent of the common childhood illness exanthem subitum (roseola infantum or <b>sixth</b> <b>disease)</b> and related febrile illnesses.

40|$|The {{number of}} members in the family Herpesviridae has {{increased}} in the last 10 years due to the description of three novel human herpesviruses: human herpesvirus 6 (HHV- 6) in 1986, human herpesvirus 7 (HHV- 7) in 1990, and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV- 8), also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), in 1994. HHV- 6 and HHV- 7 were first isolated from blood lymphocyte cultures, while HHV- 8 was identified following a specific molecular biology approach {{in the search for}} the etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma. The three viruses are lymphotropic, T-cells being the targets of HHV- 6 and HHV- 7, and B-cells being probably those of HHV- 8. The ability to be propagated in cell cultures in vitro differs according to the virus concerned: this can be done readily with HHV- 6, with more difficulties in the case of HHV- 7, and has not yet been achieved in the case of HHV- 8. Human infection with HHV- 6 and HHV- 7 is ubiquitous, widespread and acquired early in life. HHV- 8 epidemiology is still unclear, and there are two hypotheses: a restricted dissemination in the general population like herpes simplex virus type 2, or a widespread infection like all other human herpesviruses. The polymerase chain reaction is the common method for the detection of infection using specific primers and probes for HHV- 6, HHV- 7 and HHV- 8 respectively. Serologic assays are only available for HHV- 6 and HHV- 7, with limitations being due, in particular, to possible cross-reactions with cytomegalovirus. HHV- 6 is the causative agent of exanthem subitum (<b>sixth</b> <b>disease).</b> Its role as an opportunistic agent and immune dysfunction inducer is debated and currently under investigation. The pathogenic role of HHV- 7 seems to be modest, with one case of exanthem subitum reported so far. HHV- 8 is strongly associated with three diseases: Kaposi's sarcoma, Castleman's disease and body-cavity-based lymphomas. The therapy against these novel viruses has to be considered in the future...|$|E

[...] Osteoporosis is a risk factor for bone fracture and about 20% of senior citizens who sustain a hip fracture die within a year. [...] The gender gap is largely the result of the reduction of estrogen levels in women following the menopause. Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) has been shown to reduce this risk by 25–30%, and was a common reason for prescribing it during the 1980s and 1990s. However the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study that demonstrated that the risks of HRT outweighed the benefits has since led to a decline in HRT usage.|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} Spanish family with autosomal-dominant non-neuropathic {{hereditary}} amyloidosis {{with a unique}} hepatic presentation and death from liver failure, usually by the <b>sixth</b> decade. The <b>disease</b> {{is caused by a}} previously unreported deletion/insertion mutation in exon 4 of the apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) gene encoding loss of residues 60 - 71 of normal mature apoAI and insertion at that position of two new residues, ValThr. Affected individuals are heterozygous for this mutation and have both normal apoAI and variant molecules bearing one extra positive charge, as predicted from the DNA sequence. The amyloid fibrils are composed exclusively of NH 2 -terminal fragments of the variant, ending mainly at positions corresponding to residues 83 and 92 in the mature wild-type sequence. Amyloid fibrils derived from the other three known amyloidogenic apoAI variants are also composed of similar NH 2 -terminal fragments. All known amyloidogenic apoAI variants carry one extra positive charge in this region, suggesting that it may be responsible for their enhanced amyloidogenicity. In addition to causing a new phenotype, this is the first deletion mutation to be described in association with hereditary amyloidosis and it significantly extends the value of the apoAI model for investigation of molecular mechanisms of amyloid fibrillogenesis...|$|R

Overview Several such non-drug therapies have been tested in migraine, such as oxidative phosphorylation enhancers, diets and non-invasive central or peripheral neurostimulation. All of them are promising for preventive migraine treatment and are quasi-devoid of side effects. Their advantage is that they can in theory be selected for individual patients according to their pathophysiological profile and they can (and probably should) be combined with the classical pharmacological armamentarium.

40|$|Background Lowering low-density {{lipoprotein}} (LDL) cholesterol with statin therapy {{has been shown}} to reduce the incidence of atherosclerotic events in many types of patient, but it remains uncertain whether it is of net benefit among people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods Patients with advanced CKD (blood creatinine >= 1. 7 mg/dL [>= 150 mu mol/L] in men or >= 1. 5 mg/dL [>= 130 mu mol/L] in women) with no known history of myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization were randomized in a ratio of 4 : 4 : 1 to ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 20 mg daily versus matching placebo versus simvastatin 20 mg daily (with the latter arm rerandomized at 1 year to ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 20 mg daily vs placebo). The key outcome will be major atherosclerotic events, defined as the combination of myocardial infarction, coronary death, ischemic stroke, or any revascularization procedure. Results A total of 9, 438 CKD patients were randomized, of whom 3, 056 were on dialysis. Mean age was 61 years, two thirds were male, one fifth had diabetes mellitus, and one <b>sixth</b> had vascular <b>disease.</b> Compared with either placebo or simvastatin alone, allocation to ezetimibe plus simvastatin was not associated with any excess of myopathy, hepatic toxicity, or biliary complications {{during the first year of}} follow-up.

40|$|Background: Esophageal {{cancer is}} the eighth most common {{malignancy}} and <b>sixth</b> most fatal <b>disease</b> worldwide. However, it is the fourth {{most common cause of}} death in China. Although surgery is currently the recommended course of treatment, there are some patients that do not receive radical treatment due to the presence of distant organ or lymph node metastasis. There is at present no established treatment standard for esophageal cancer patients with distant organ metastasis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the prognostic factors involved in determining survival of esophageal cancer patients with distant organ metastasis at initial diagnosis, and to provide a reference for the planning of a clinical treatment strategy. Methods: The data of 57 evaluable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients with distant organ metastasis at initial diagnosis were studied retrospectively. The survival rate was calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method, and the log-rank test was used to test the differences. Multivariable analysis was performed using the Cox proportion hazards model. Results: The median survival time for all patients was 6 months (range, 1 – 55 months), and the 1 - and 2 -year survival rates were 21. 1 % and 11. 8 %, respectively. The median survival time for patients with single metastasis was 10 months with 1 - and 2 -year survival rates of 47. 4 % and 28. 1 %, respectively. For patients with multiple metastases, the survival duration was 5 months, with 1 - and 2 -year survival rates of 7. 9 % and 3. 9 %, respectively (p <  0. 001). The 1 - and 2 -year survival rates with multimodality treatment were 70 % and 45 %, respectively, which were significantly better than chemotherapy alone (13. 3 % and 8. 9 %, respectively, p =  0. 003) and best supportive care (5. 9 % and 0 %, p <  0. 001), but there was no significant difference between the latter two groups (p =  0. 061). Conclusion: For esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients with distant organ metastasis upon initial diagnosis, the presence of a single metastasis appeared to favor overall survival compared to multiple metastases. Multimodality treatment may also improve patient survival, but chemotherapy alone has not been established as a favorable prognostic factor...|$|R
40|$|The International Classification of <b>Diseases,</b> <b>Sixth</b> Edition (ICD- 6; World Health Organization, 1949) is a {{universal}} health care management tool for examining the pathology of diseases and how to properly diagnose and treat said diseases. The birth of {{the first edition of}} the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-I; American Psychiatric Association, 1952) is the product of the ICD and the American Medico-psychological Association and first delivered shortly {{after the end of the}} Second World War. As per request of the American Armed Forces, which were ill-equipped to manage the surge of mental disorders after the war, the need for a uniform classification system to diagnose the rising number of disorders classified as numerous names and symptoms, or inexistent in medical nomenclature, was perceived to be undoubtedly dire. Unlike the ICD, the DSM was constructed particularly for American classifications of mental disorders and psychosis, both organic and inorganic, which would in the course of over 60 years expand its diagnosis to thousands of American civilians. Since the first publication of the DSM, there have been six additional publications that essentially define what is 2 ̆ 2 normal 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 deviant 2 ̆ 2 as it relates to social behavior and function. The purpose of this research is to examine the trend of Axis II personality disorders within DSM-I through V (APA, 1952 2 ̆ 6 2013) in regards to its continually revised definition of the boundaries of American normalcy and the 2 ̆ 2 other 2 ̆ 2; its impact on social behavior, economic disparity; the implications of corralling the masses through medicalization; and an ideation of political dominance that presumes to know what is best for the general population. By utilizing the seven editions of the DSM to examine the literature within the manuals, it will assist in guiding through the trends of personality disorder classifications per edition in comparison to a necessity for controlling maladaptive behaviors. With this information in hand, it will facilitate in the evaluation of how compartmentalized human behavior has become in relation to a limited knowledge of the social spectrum...|$|R
