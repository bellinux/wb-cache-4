25|$|In June 1997 Sinclair Research {{released}} the X1 radio for £9.50. This miniature mono FM radio, {{powered by a}} CR2032 battery, had a fixed volume and was inserted in the ear. The X1 radio had three buttons, an on/off switch, a <b>Scan</b> <b>button,</b> and a Reset button to restart the scanning process. It came with a short length of aerial and a detachable ear hook.|$|E
5000|$|The Honda Legend was {{introduced}} for the 1987 model {{year and was}} virtually identical in equipment offered and vehicle dimensions to the North American model, with one trim designation called the V6-2.5i. This means very few options were available other than the choice of transmission, and an air conditioning system identical to the North American version. The Europeans were offered an optional [...] "Special Equipment Pack" [...] that offered cruise control, aluminium alloy wheels, a driver's seat with power lumbar support, height, fore/aft and reclining adjusters, adjustable rear headrests, a 4 speaker stereo system provided by Philips and headlight wipers. Front and rear mud flaps were standard in undisclosed countries but not all. The radio volume control rocker switch and preset radio <b>scan</b> <b>button</b> installed on the instrument binnacle was not offered.|$|E
5000|$|In 1985, WSB-FM, at {{the time}} known as [...] "99FM", sued AC {{competitor}} WLTA-FM 99.7 [...] "Warm 99", claiming copyright infringement. Arbitron was docking both stations in the ratings because of the common use of [...] "99". In the landmark case, Cox v. Susquehanna Broadcasting, the judge was handed a digital radio and asked to tune to 100.0 MHz. There was no signal. To find the nearest station, he pressed the <b>Scan</b> <b>button,</b> and it stopped on 101.5 MHz (WKHX-FM). Next, he entered 99.0 MHz, which, again, contained no signal. Scanning from there, the radio hit 99.7, WLTA's frequency. In his precedent-setting decision, the Federal district judge stated that on a radio dial [...] "a radio station's frequency is its address" [...] and one cannot copyright an address. On June 25, he {{ruled in favor of}} Warm 99. Soon thereafter, WSB-FM became known as [...] "B98.5FM".|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel way to {{recognize}} users {{by the way}} they press a button. Our approach allows low-effort and fast inter-action without the need for augmenting the user or controlling the environment. It eschews privacy concerns of methods such as fingerprint <b>scanning.</b> <b>Button</b> pressing behavior is suf-ficiently discriminative to allow distinguishing users within small groups. This approach combines recognition and action in a single step, e. g., getting and tallying a coffee can be done with one button press. We deployed our system for 5 users over a period of 4 weeks and achieved recognition rates of 95 % in the last week. We also ran a larger scale but short-term evaluation to investigate effects of group size and found that our method degrades gracefully for larger groups.

50|$|The Tender Buttons {{works were}} {{developed}} when Hipkins was in New York on the International Studio and Curatorial Programme residency. In these works, images from artworks and objects in museum collections are overlaid with oversized <b>scans</b> of <b>buttons</b> sourced from New York's garment district, {{located near the}} residency hub. The title of the works alludes to Gertrude Stein's Tender Buttons.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{enthusiasm and}} the success of such data, single source has been plagued by high costs and small sample sizes, due to the cost of getting people to do all the work {{associated}} with home barcode <b>scanning</b> and pushing <b>buttons</b> on peoplemeters or even carrying and uploading from passive peoplemeters.|$|R
40|$|BEPC is a 2. 2 GeV electron-positron collider. Thirty-two button-type beam {{position}} monitors (BPMs) {{are used}} for the position measurements of the colliding e+ e− beams in the storage ring. The beam positions can be measured separately and simultaneously for e+ and e − beams due to the wide-band processing electronics. The reliability of measurements is assured by the self-consistency check. The C program “WINBPM ” running on a personal computer (PC) in the local station, controls the BPM processing e lectronics. The funct ion, “BPMSCAN ” of “WINBPM ” loops forever, <b>scanning</b> each <b>button</b> of all BPMs, reading button voltage values, converting these values to x and y positions, and storing button voltage and orbit position values in memories on another PC, {{which serves as a}} communication server. These data can be accessed by the main computer in the BEPC central control room through network. The com-munication software relies on the TCP/IP socket library. ...|$|R
40|$|Electronic voting systems {{offer the}} promise of faster and more {{accurate}} voting, but the current reality is that few of the systems have been independently tested for voter usability issues. This study reports on a large-scale field experiment in which we investigated the usability of six voting systems representing a variety of interfaces (optical <b>scan,</b> touch screen, <b>buttons</b> and dials, membrane buttons) and other characteristics (including portion of ballot visible, advancing mechanism, paper trail). The subject pool included demographic variation and over-represented the elderly and others who were inexperienced with computers. The ballot included a variety o...|$|R
5|$|The {{release of}} Street Fighter II in 1991 is {{considered}} a revolutionary moment in the fighting game genre. Yoshiki Okamoto's team developed the most accurate joystick and <b>button</b> <b>scanning</b> routine in the genre thus far. This allowed players to reliably execute multi-button special moves, which had previously required an element of luck. The graphics took advantage of Capcom's CPS arcade chipset, with highly detailed characters and stages. Whereas previous games allowed players to combat a variety of computer-controlled fighters, Street Fighter II allowed players to play against each other. The popularity of Street Fighter II surprised the gaming industry, as arcade owners bought more machines {{to keep up with}} demand. Street Fighter II was also responsible for popularizing the combo mechanic, which came about when skilled players learned that they could combine several attacks that left no time for the opponent to recover if they timed them correctly.|$|R
40|$|This chapter, co-written by Susan Johanknecht and Katharine Meynell was {{commissioned}} for the publication 'The Book is A - Live!' This book was produced to document {{and respond to}} the conference ‘Book Live!’ International Symposium held in June 2012, at South Bank University. It was peer reviewed by Emmanuelle Waekerle, Bookroom, University of the Creative Arts and Richard-Sawdon-Smith, South Bank University, the institutions funding the event and publication. Collaborative practice and ‘transforming’ or ‘expanding’ of the page in relation to the book are key themes of my research. 'The Book is A - Live!' 2013 book publication was published by RGAP, distributed by Cornerhouse and DAP. Abstract Poetry of Unknown Words explores an expanded notion of the book and the archive socially culturally and politically. Using a number of libraries & archives we reference key works in a variety of technologies moving between the digital, letterpress and hand made mark. Responding to existing artifacts, making new works, we examine issues of material values and shifting meanings. This interest in the artifact itself, rather than the signifying text/image alone, gives us the opportunity to understand historical context through material means. Work aware of it’s history allows “a re-emergence of (that) history through detail” to not replicate or eradicate history but to keep the origins as visible traces. Taking the format of Iliazd La Poesie de mots inconnus and applying it to a new series of works which in turn reference extant works by women makers and thinkers. Sections pay particular attention to technologies, their scientific and artistic applications thus reworking ‘thingness’. If the medium is also the message, and the site and location carry additional meaning, these must be accounted for in a re-rendering – the physical qualities of the paper, ink or fustiness of the rare books collection –and being mindful of that which is left out. Implicit in this is our acknowledgement of the untranslatable, the lost nuances, and the stains collected by the shifting of context within a new language or medium. In both translation and transcription there are taints, residues and colouring, both lost from the original, and acquired in re-forming a work in a new guise, with new technologies. In considering the difference between translation and transcription it is useful to remember that one is notionally linguistic, and the other moves between modes of expression such as in music or in painting, or between movement and reenactment. What we understand we are doing in Poetry of Unknown Words incorporates both. For us these are open and moveable concepts – responsive and pragmatic. The literary section shown at the Poetry Library, South Bank (March–May 2012) included: HD's notes on thought and vision: taking the jellyfish as an erotic symbol of creative force, which we are using in combination with an archivist's account. Emmy Hennings' Dada performance writing and puppetry: reworked through ‘Google translatate’ keeping the spirit of non-sense for that era. Gertrude Stein’s Tender Buttons: transcribed from words to buttons, uses text to generate system and order. <b>Scanned</b> <b>buttons</b> represent words, set out as 'Type' in InDesign leading to a new typography and code. Valerie Solanas' SCUM Manifesto: we consider the form of manifesto as a work, which linguistically proclaims a struggle against oppressive forces. Using Chicago type designed by Susan Kare and on the verso, a loss of information without uploaded font. Mary Wollstonecraft’s Vindication of the Rights of Women: using letterpress and random inking, presents her contents page as abstract with digital facsimile stamp. These processes of remaking engage with historical distance and new approaches to what the book can be. We see this chapter within 'The Book is A - Live!' as part of our ongoing 'process notes' - being reflections and documentation of our Poetry of Unknown Words project...|$|R
