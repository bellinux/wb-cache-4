50|$|An NMI {{is often}} used when {{response}} time is critical or when an interrupt should never be disabled during normal system operation.

40|$|In this paper, a {{class of}} linear {{dynamical}} <b>systems,</b> called linear <b>reset</b> <b>systems,</b> is studied from a geometric point of view. Their state satisfies a system of linear differential equations (with constant coefficients) but they are provided with a mechanism which resets the state when a certain condition is met. In particular, when the dynamical <b>system</b> without <b>reset</b> is stable, sufficient conditions on the reset structure are given, which guarantee asymptotic stability of the corresponding <b>reset</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

50|$|This resets {{the panel}} after an alarm condition. All {{initiating}} devices are reset, and {{the panel is}} cleared of any alarm conditions. If an initiating device is still in alarm after the system is reset, such as a smoke detector continuing to sense smoke or a manual pull station still in an activated position, another alarm will be initiated, or in some cases, the panel will refuse to reset until all the alarms have been reset/cleared. A <b>system</b> <b>reset</b> is often required to clear supervisory conditions. A <b>system</b> <b>reset</b> does not usually clear trouble conditions. Most trouble conditions will clear automatically when conditions are returned to normal.|$|E

50|$|On an IBM mainframe, a {{power-on}} reset (POR) is {{a sequence}} of actions that the processor performs either due to a POR request from the operator {{or as part of}} turning on power.

A <b>System</b> <b>Reset</b> (SRST) signal is quite common, letting debuggers reset the whole system, not just the parts with JTAG support. Sometimes there are event signals used to trigger activity by the host or by the device being monitored through JTAG; or, perhaps, additional control lines.|$|E

The tool has been developed using Sysquake, a Matlab-like language with fast execution and excellent facilities for interactive graphics, and is delivered as a stand-alone executable that is readily accessible to students and users.

Such arrangement leads to varying trajectories of image pixels colors beyond both sides of F and will all follow a concentric circle, as shown in Figure  3 (b). This results in a simple and adaptive skin color detection process which only needs to examine the variances on the pixel’s hue.|$|R

50|$|When {{the distant}} signal is at 'caution' or yellow (on), the {{electro-magnet}} is de-energised. As the train passes, the permanent magnet sets the system. However, since the electro-magnet is de-energised, the <b>system</b> is not <b>reset.</b> After the one-second delay {{within which the}} <b>system</b> can be <b>reset,</b> a horn warning is given until the driver acknowledges by pressing a plunger. If the driver fails to acknowledge the warning within 2.75 seconds, the brakes are automatically applied. If the driver does acknowledge the warning, the indicator disk changes to yellow and black, to remind the driver that he has acknowledged a warning. The yellow and black indication persists until the next signal {{and serves as a}} reminder between signals that the driver is proceeding under caution. The one-second delay before the horn sounds allows the system to operate correctly down to speeds as low as 1.75 miles per hour. Below this speed, the caution horn warning will always be given, but it will be automatically cancelled when the electromagnet <b>resets</b> the <b>system</b> if the driver has not already done so. The display will indicate all black once the <b>system</b> <b>resets.</b>|$|R

Usually reset signals are provided, one or both of TRST (TAP reset) and SRST (<b>system</b> <b>reset).</b> The connector usually provides the board-under-test's logic supply voltage so that the JTAG adapters use the appropriate logic levels. The board voltage may also serve as a [...] "board present" [...] debugger input. Other event input or output signals may be provided, or general purpose I/O (GPIO) lines, to support more complex debugging architectures.|$|E
50|$|The 64 KB RAM of the HGC {{could hold}} two {{graphics}} display pages. Either page could be selected for display by setting or resetting a single {{bit in the}} Mode Control Register. Another bit, in a configuration register exclusive to the HGC, determined whether the second 32 KB of RAM on the HGC was accessible to the CPU at the base address B8000h. This bit was reset at <b>system</b> <b>reset</b> (e.g. power-on) so that the card would not conflict with a CGA or other color card at address B8000h.|$|E
50|$|Microelectronic devices using {{open drain}} signals (such as microcontrollers) {{may provide a}} 'weak' {{internal}} pull-up resistor to connect the terminal in question to a positive voltage source/rail like Vdd of the device. Such weak pullups, often {{on the order of}} 100 kΩ, reduce power usage by keeping input signals from floating. External pullups are stronger (perhaps 3 kΩ) to reduce signal rise times (like with I²C) or to minimize noise (like on <b>system</b> <b>RESET</b> inputs). Internal pullups can often be disabled for cases where there is an external one, or in other cases where they are not needed.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{stochastic}} thermodynamics of <b>resetting</b> <b>systems.</b> Violation of microreversibility {{means that the}} well known derivations of fluctuations theorems break down for dynamics with resetting. Despite that we show that stochastic <b>resetting</b> <b>systems</b> satisfy two integral fluctuation theorems. The first is the Hatano-Sasa relation describing the transition between two steady states. The second integral fluctuation theorem involves a functional that includes both dynamical and thermodynamic contributions. We find that the second law-like inequality found by Fuchs et al. for <b>resetting</b> <b>systems</b> [EPL, 113, (2016) ] can be recovered from this integral fluctuation theorem {{with the help of}} Jensen's inequality.

5000|$|Because AmigaOS {{was rather}} buggy {{at the time}} of the A1000's release, the OS was not placed in ROM then.

The WCS is write-protected after loading, and <b>system</b> <b>resets</b> do not require a reload of the WCS. In Europe, the WCS was often referred to as WOM (Write Once Memory), a play on the more conventional term [...] "ROM" [...] (read-only memory).|$|R
5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "alarm silence" [...] or [...] "audible silence". Depending on the {{configuration}} of the alarm system, this function will either silence the system's notification appliances completely or will silence only the audible alarm, while strobe lights continue to flash. Audible silence allows for easier communication amongst emergency responders while responding to an alarm. This can also be used during construction as a means of a preliminary test, before the final full test. Audible silence is usually used right after the emergency has been dealt with and the building is ready to be reoccupied again. A <b>system</b> <b>reset</b> usually comes right after.|$|E
5000|$|As {{part of the}} IPL {{facility}} {{the operator}} has a means of specifying a 12-bit device address, typically with three dials {{as shown in the}} operator controls drawing. When the operator selects the Load function, the system performs a <b>System</b> <b>Reset,</b> sends a Read IPL channel command to the selected device in order to read 24 bytes into locations 0-23 and causes the channel to begin fetching CCWs at location 8; the effect is as if the channel had fetched a CCW with a length of 24, and address of 0 and the flags containing Command Chaining + Suppress Length Indication. At the completion of the operation, the system stores the I/O address in the halfword at location 2 and loads the PSW from location 0.|$|E
50|$|Some {{microcontrollers}} provide special hardware interfaces which {{cannot be}} used to take arbitrary control of a system or directly run code, but instead they allow the insertion of boot code into bootable non-volatile memory (like flash memory) via simple protocols. Then at the manufacturing phase, such interfaces are used to inject boot code (and possibly other code) into non-volatile memory. After <b>system</b> <b>reset,</b> the microcontroller begins to execute code programmed into its non-volatile memory, just like usual processors are using ROMs for booting. Most notably this technique is used by Atmel AVR microcontrollers, and by others as well. In many cases such interfaces are implemented by hardwired logic. In other cases such interfaces could be created by software running in integrated on-chip boot ROM from GPIO pins.|$|E
