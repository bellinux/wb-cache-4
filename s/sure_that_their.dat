25|$|This {{is often}} highly {{emphasized}} by spectators and novice vaulters, {{but it is}} arguably the easiest phase of the vault and {{is a result of}} proper execution of previous phases. This phase mainly consists of the vaulter pushing off the pole and releasing it so it falls away from the bar and mats. As the torso goes over and around the bar, the vaulter is facing the bar. Rotation of the body over the bar occurs naturally, and the vaulter's main concern is making <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> arms, face and any other appendages do not knock the bar off as they go over. The vaulter should land near the middle of the foam landing mats, or pits, face up.|$|E
25|$|In Chile, Merlot {{thrives in}} the Apalta region of Colchagua Province. It is also grown in {{significant}} quantities in Curicó, Casablanca and the Maipo Valley. Until the early 1990s, the Chilean wine industry mistakenly sold a large quantity of wine {{made from the}} Carménère grape as Merlot. Following the discovery that many Chilean vineyards thought to be planted with Sauvignon blanc was actually Sauvignonasse, {{the owners of the}} Chilean winery Domaine Paul Bruno (who previously worked with Château Margaux and Château Cos d'Estournel) invited ampelographers to comb through their vineyards to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> wines were properly identified. Genetic studies discovered that much of what had been grown as Merlot was actually Carménère, an old French variety that had gone largely extinct in France due to its poor resistance to phylloxera. While the vines, leaves and grapes look very similar, both grapes produce wines with distinct characteristics — Carménère being more strongly flavored with green pepper notes and Merlot having softer fruit with chocolate notes.|$|E
25|$|The {{selection}} of Williamsport as county seat {{was a major}} controversy in {{the early history of}} Lycoming County. It involved a bitter rivalry between an old frontier town and an upstart town that was built on a swamp. The first commissioners and officers of Lycoming County had their first offices and held their first court in Jaysburg (now part of the Newberry section of Williamsport). Jaysburg was on the western side of Lycoming Creek on a high piece of land. The land to the east of Lycoming Creek was known as Deer Park and was quite swampy. Jaysburg was at the time the only sizable village west of Muncy. Although Muncy was and still is in Lycoming County, it was not considered as an option for county seathood, possibly due to its proximity to the southern and eastern borders of the county. Jaysburg's buildings were sufficient to serve as the first courthouse and jail in the history of Lycoming County. It seemed to be the most logical place for establishing a county seat, and many of its residents were <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> town would indeed be the county seat. This was not to be. The county seat was awarded to a new community across the creek and Jaysburg soon disappeared from the map; its land was absorbed by the new city of Williamsport.|$|E

500|$|This myth {{was founded}} in the factual {{knowledge}} of the immigrants' participation in the battles, and the mythical knowledge because {{of the differences in}} the number of victims, the leaving of the injured on the fields of battle, and that the Latrun battle was the hardest and most important in the war. The influence on written history appeared primarily in books and commentary, where [...] "the immigrants wanted only to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> contribution at the battle was written in the collective memory with a plus sign". It didn't bring new documents but it expressed itself in memoirs, reminiscences and obituaries by or of those involved in the events. It was a view that was seldom heard in polemics giving two preceding versions of events but that had a life of its own, given to it by the immigrants.|$|E
500|$|Winthrop gave {{a speech}} to the General Court in July 1645, stating that {{there are two kinds of}} liberty: natural liberty to do as one wished, [...] "evil as well as good," [...] a liberty that he {{believed}} should be restrained; and civil liberty to do good. Winthrop strongly believed that civil liberty was [...] "the proper end and object of authority", meaning that it was the duty of the government to be selfless for the people and promote justice instead of promoting the general welfare. He supported this point of view by his actions, such as when he passed laws requiring the heads of households to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> children and servants received proper education, and for support of teachers from public funds. Winthrop's actions were for the unity of the colony because he believed that nothing was more crucial of a colony than working as a single unit that wouldn't be split by any force, such as with the case of Anne Hutchinson. He was a leader respected by many, even Richard Dummer, a principal Hutchinsonian disarmed for his activities, who gave 100 pounds to him.|$|E
500|$|The creators' and producers' {{goals were}} to [...] "empower, challenge, {{and build the}} {{self-esteem}} of preschoolers" [...] while entertaining them. Kessler, Santomero and Johnson were influenced by Sesame Street, the first children's television program to utilize a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum developed from research. [...] "We wanted to learn from Sesame Street and take it one step further," [...] Santomero said. [...] Like Sesame Street, formative research which the producers called their [...] "secret sauce," [...] was used during {{all aspects of the}} creative and decision-making process during the production of Blue's Clues. In addition to a curriculum that emphasized reasoning skills relevant to preschoolers' everyday lives, the producers wanted to include audience participation, called by Variety its [...] "call and response style," [...] that encouraged mastery of the information presented, positive reinforcement, and prosocial messages. In their first brainstorming sessions in 1994, Santomero, Kessler, and Johnson decided to promote mastery rather than rote learning or memorizing, make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> viewers knew the answers to the puzzles with which they were presented, and include elements of surprise and play. By 2001, the show's research team consisted of head researcher Alice Wilder, Alison Sherman, Karen Leavitt, and Koshi Dhingra. The research team and creators worked collaboratively.|$|E

500|$|The 1850s and 1860s also {{mark the}} line between what some {{scholars}} see as the idealistic, Hegelian young Marx from the more scientifically minded mature Marx writings of the later period. This distinction is usually associated with the structural Marxism school and not all scholars agree that it exists. The years of revolution from 1848 to 1849 had been a grand experience for both Marx and Engels. They both became <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> economic view of {{the course of history}} was the only valid way that historic events like the revolutionary upsurge of 1848 could be adequately explained. For some time after 1848, Marx and Engels wondered if the entire revolutionary upsurge had completely played out. As time passed, they began to think that a new revolutionary upsurge would not occur until there was another economic downturn. The question of whether a recession would be necessary to create a new revolutionary situation in society became a point of contention between Marx and certain other revolutionaries. Marx accused these other revolutionaries of being [...] "adventurists" [...] because of their belief that a revolutionary situation could be created out of thin air by the sheer [...] "will power" [...] of the revolutionaries without regard to the economic realities of the current situation.|$|E

2500|$|The major {{break with}} {{mainstream}} Christianity came in 431, {{due to the}} pronouncements of the First Council of Ephesus.

While {{the teaching of the}} Council of Ephesus was accepted within the Roman Empire, the Sasanian church disagreed with the condemnation of Nestorius' teachings. When Nestorius was deposed as patriarch, a number of his followers fled to the Sasanian Empire. Persian emperors used this opportunity to strengthen Nestorius' position within the Sasanian church (which made up {{the vast majority of the}} Christians in the predominantly Zoroastrian Persian Empire) by eliminating the most important pro-Roman clergymen in Persia and making <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> places were taken by Nestorians.

By 1954, the Fords were extremely successful and {{were living in a}} duplex apartment on Park Avenue. To make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> models were the most successful, the Fords provided hair dressers, dermatologists, and Eileen dispensed diet advice constantly.
