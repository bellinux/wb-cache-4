5000|$|Before {{its initial}} release, {{the phone was}} rumored to be the {{replacement}} for the ThunderBolt, and even nicknamed the [...] "Thunderbolt 2" [...] in the enthusiast community. The HTC Rezound is the second Verizon Wireless phone available that allows simultaneous surf and talk on the Verizon Wireless 4G LTE network. This capability {{is due to the}} duplication of some functions between the Qualcomm Snapdragon S3 MSM8660 <b>SoC</b> (<b>System</b> <b>on</b> <b>Chip)</b> and the Qualcomm MSM9600 modem chip. The Snapdragon SoC provides all CDMA2000 functionality, including voice, while the MSM9600 duplicates CDMA2000 data functionality with the addition of GSM-derived LTE (Long Term Evolution) functionality.This also gave the HTC Rezound the ability to simultaneous surf and talk in 3G environments.This arrangement also calls for radio antenna redundancy. The phone has a 4.3 inch 1280x720 display and was tied with the Sony Xperia S for the highest pixel density in any smartphone released (342 PPI) until the arrival of HTC Butterfly/Droid DNA with a 5-inch 1920x1080 resolution screen (440 PPI).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Prototyping large <b>SoCs</b> (<b>Systems</b> <b>on</b> <b>Chip)</b> using {{multiple}} FPGAs introduces {{a risk of}} errors on inter-FPGA links.

We propose using high-speed serial interconnect between FPGAs, with a transparent error detection and correction protocol working on a link-by-link basis. Our inter-FPGA interconnect has an interface that resembles that of a network-on-chip, providing a consistent interface to a prototype SoC and masking the difference between on-chip and off-chip interconnect. Low-latency communication and low area usage are favoured at the expense of a little bandwidth inefficiency, a trade-off we believe is appropriate given the high bandwidth of inter-FPGA links.

40|$|Abstract — Low energy {{consumption}} {{is a critical}} issue in embedded systems design. As the technology feature sizes of <b>SoC</b> (<b>Systems</b> <b>on</b> <b>Chip)</b> become smaller and smaller, the percentage of leakage power consumption in total power consumption continues to grow. Traditional Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) fail to accurately address the impact of scaling <b>on</b> <b>system</b> power consumption as the leakage power increases exponentially. The combination of DVS and Adaptive Body Biasing (ABB) is an effective technique to jointly optimize dynamic and leakage energy dissipation. In this paper, we propose an optimal soft real-time Rotation scheduling and voltage assignment algorithm, RSVAME (Rotation Scheduling and Voltage Assignment to Minimize Energy), to minimize both dynamic and leakage energy via DVS and ABB. Voltage transition overhead has been considered in our approach. We conduct experiments {{on a set of}} DSP benchmarks based on the power model of 70 nm technology. The experimental results show that our approach achieves significant energy saving than that of ILP (Integer Linear Programming) approach. I...|$|R

The ever increasing density of embedded memories <b>on</b> <b>SoC’s</b> (<b>System</b> <b>on</b> <b>Chips)</b> gives rise to many defects and faults which cannot be identified during the fabrication process.

Even the occurrence of a single fault may lead to disasters. This emphasizes the importance of comparing and evaluating existing March tests considering all types of faults.

40|$|Drastic {{change in}} ASIC and <b>SOCs</b> (<b>Systems</b> <b>on</b> <b>Chips)</b> has forced entire chip design {{to focus on}} power consumption. In the earlier generations of IC {{technology}}, the main focus was on the area, performance, cost and reliability. As the technology is advancing from l 30 nm to 90 nm to 65 nm, at 130 -nm processes, foundries started to employ new techniques and materials, such as low-k dielectrics and copper, in silicon processes to increase design performance. However, smaller geometries, scaled thresholds, and unscaled voltages produced smaller, speedier JCs but produced a nasty side effect such as leakage, or static power. By the 90 -nm node, power management started to become a huge concern, and, at the 65 -nm node, low-power-design techniques are a must.
