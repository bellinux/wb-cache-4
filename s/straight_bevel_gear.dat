40|$|A {{practical}} {{application of the}} spherical involute surface to the forged <b>straight</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> is provided and demonstrated in this work. Conjugate (pure involute) theoretical surfaces are developed from the input design parameters. The surfaces are modified to suit the actual application (automotive differential). The unloaded (or low load) tooth contact analysis of modified surfaces is performed to obtain the prediction of the contact pattern. In order to verify the procedure and predictions, actual <b>straight</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> are forged by using provided surfaces, and their contact pattern is compared to the predictions.

50|$|The {{advantage}} of the spiral tooth over the straight tooth is that they engage more gradually. The contact between the teeth starts {{at one end of}} the gear and then spreads across the whole tooth. This results in a less abrupt transfer of force when a new pair of teeth come into play. With <b>straight</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gears,</b> the abrupt tooth engagement causes noise, especially at high speeds, and impact stress on the teeth which makes them unable to take heavy loads at high speeds without breaking. For these reasons <b>straight</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> are generally limited to use at linear speeds less than 1000 feet/min; or, for small gears, under 1000 r.p.m.|$|R

The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the contact pressure distribution and evolution laws in <b>straight</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> meshing.

This research has great theoretical significance to reveal the wear mechanism and improve the meshing performance of straight bevel gears...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Involute <b>straight</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> pair often {{appears the}} phenomenons of meshing interference, impact and "end contact " {{in the course}} of meshing. Usually, {{symmetrical}} crowning is adopted to improve above phenomenons, however, due to the influence of complicated tooth loads and other complicated factors, the symmetrical crowned gear may not reach a good modification effect. In this paper, we adopt target variable curvature crowning according to the specific conditions of bevel gears in order to obtain good modification effect, nevertheless, because of the complexity of the variable curvature crowning, the conventional method of using space spherical involute stretch and sweep standard gear model to remove tooth surface materials has been unable to meet the accurate requirements of the variable curvature crowned model, at the same time, this method can not realize parametric modeling of modification bevel gear. Therefore, this paper puts forward an easy to realize parametric modeling method of accurate variable curvature crowning for involute <b>straight</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> based on ANSYS/LS-DYNA, Imageware, Matlab and Solidworks. This method can realize the accurate modeling for variable curvature crowned involute <b>straight</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> and ensure the accuracy of modification gears and follow-up finite element simulation, meanwhile, it provides theoretical basis for parametric modeling of variable curvature crowned involute <b>straight</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gear.</b> Finally, the superiority of variable curvature crowning is tested through numerical simulation under specific conditions...|$|E
