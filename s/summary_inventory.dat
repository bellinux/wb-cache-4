40|$|E 2014 : 052, <b>SUMMARY</b> <b>Inventory</b> of raw {{materials}} holds {{an important role in}} companies within the manufacturing sector. The inventory works as a buffer that secure the supply of materials to the production unit. The aim of the inventory is to ensure that the company is able to meet the customers’ demands despite fluctuations and variations in the material flow. The size of the warehouse and the layout are physical limitations for the quantity of articles that can be stored. In addition, the quantity of articles and different types of articles are limited by the material planning. As follows, these three aspects limit the quantity of different articles {{that can be used in}} the production unit. A large supply of material to the production unit increases the flexibility towards customers and their demand. The study is carried out at Stora Enso Packagings production plant in Skene. The company desires to increase the number of different articles stored in the warehouse. This is to be able to acquire economic benefits in the production process. The study investigates how an increased number of articles could be stored in the warehouse. This is investigated through an analysis of the material planning methods and the physical layout of the warehouse. Calculations of the sizes of the stock locations and the layout of the warehouse are carried out in order to optimize the utilization of the volume of the physical warehouse without compromising efficient material handling. The result of this study shows that it is possible to lower the stock levels and increase the different types of articles in the warehouse by optimizing the material planning and the layout of the warehouse. A prerequisite to accomplish this and to secure a well-functioning material flow is valid data of the fluctuations and variations in the material flow. As a conclusion, an improved layout of the warehouse enables increased cost efficiency in the way of meeting the demands of customers. Warehouses that allow storage for a large number of different articles also offer a broad spectrum of materials for the company to use in the manufacturing process. This results in increased flexibility and ability to meet the customers’ needs. The study does not consider any economic aspects or new investments...|$|E

50|$|In 1982, the Commissioners of Public Works {{decided to}} publish a series of archaeological inventories, {{designed}} to be comprehensive listings of all sites but providing only very brief <b>summaries.</b> The <b>inventories</b> came with the hope to raise awareness for the monuments to defend against the increasing destruction of vulnerable sites. The series started in 1986 with County Louth. Currently, it consists of 21 volumes, covering, at least partially, 16 of the 26 traditional counties of the Republic. In a subsequent phase, a series of much more detailed archaeological surveys was to be published. Currently, only one such volume was published {{by the government in}} 1989 for County Louth that was inspired by the previously published archaeological surveys for County Down and County Donegal.|$|R

40|$|Retrieval {{practice}} of previously studied material can impair subsequent memory for related unpracticed material. An emerging view holds that such retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF) may affect episodic recollection, {{but not the}} context-free familiarity of the affected items. Here, a survey of accruing recent findings of RIF in recognition tests shows that the impairment of unpracticed material depends vitally on baseline memory strength. Therein, the absence of RIF under specific conditions, previously taken as evidence for the immunity of familiarity, can be predicted on grounds of exceedingly low baseline levels. Similarly, differential RIF effects on the parameters of dual-process recognition models {{can be explained by}} baseline differences, suggesting that RIF might impair any sub-process that substantially contributes to overall recognition accuracy. By contrast, the strengthening of practiced material appears independent of baseline levels and does not predict the magnitude of RIF, in accordance with an inhibitory causation of the forgetting. In <b>summary,</b> the <b>inventory</b> presents RIF in recognition as a subtle proportional impairment, future illumination of which may demand increased attention to baseline memory levels...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there is}} a trend to the {{development}} of the electronic patient record, the need for uniform classification systems to document diagnoses and procedures is still there. In the European Union, some research projects or concerted actions promote the concept of episodes of care, meaning that the clinical status of a patient might be followed by different health professionals in various health care settings (ambulatory care, emergency, inpatient, long term care) through medical record <b>summaries.</b> An <b>inventory</b> of teaching and training tools related to information systems that classify diagnoses in various health care settings has been made during the year 1998. Its results show that casemix tools are mainly used for hospital inpatients, much less for outpatients and almost never yet to link episodes of care. Computerised training tools exist in several countries for coding as well as for grouping patients but this area appears still too knew in the field of education because of a lack of European health policy to use uniform data sets in order to measure the degree of efficiency as well as the quality of health care delivery systems in the European union country members...|$|R
40|$|The three volume, 960 page report, {{entitled}} Human Reactions in Disaster Situations {{issued in}} 1954 by the National Opinion Research center (NORC) at the University of Chicago, is a classic. Not {{because it has}} been widely read for very seldom do I encounter anyone who has ever seen a copy of the publication, much less perused it. Not because its specific contents are very well known and used as a starting base in current disaster research scientific circles; for different reasons the various <b>summaries</b> and <b>inventories</b> of disaster finding have not presented any of the data or findings, except by Barton who gives some limited and selective material in his now two decade old book, Communities in Disaster (1970 : 130 - 138). And the NORC work, whether generally or specifically, is very seldom cited in the present day disaster research literature, and extremely few libraries have copies of the report. Rather our argument is the publication is a classic for two other reasons: 1) it primarily reports on what by most criteria which could be used is still the best survey study so far undertaken in the disaster area, and 2) because of the mostly unrecognized by highly significant influence the NORC work had done on the historical development of disaster studies in the United States and on how much of the current research in the area is conducted...|$|R

40|$|The Marine Network for Integrated Data Access (MaNIDA) aims {{to build}} a {{sustainable}} e-Infrastruture to support discovery and re-use of data archived in a distributed network of data providers in Germany (see related abstracts in session ESSI 1. 2 and session ESSI 2. 2). Because {{one of the primary}} focus of MaNIDA is the underway data acquired on board of German academic research vessels, we will be addressing various issues related to cruise-level metadata, shiptrack navigation, sampling events conducted during the cruise (event logs), standardization of device-related (type, name, parameters) and place-related (gazetteer) vocabularies, QA/QC procedures (near real time and post-cruise validation, corrections, quality flags) as well as ingestion and management of contextual information (e. g. various types of cruise-related reports and project-related information). One of MaNIDA’s long-term goal {{is to be able to}} offer an integrative “one-stop-shop” framework for man- agement and access of ship-related information based on international standards and interoperability. This access framework will be freely available and is intended for scientists, funding agencies and the public. The master “catalog” we are building currently contains information from 13 German academic research vessels and respective cruises (to date 1900 cruises with expected growing rate of 150 cruises annually). Moreover, MaNIDA’s operational infrastructure will additionally provide a direct pipeline to SeaDataNet Cruise <b>Summary</b> Report <b>Inventory,</b> among others. In this presentation, we will focus on the extensions we are currently implementing to support automated acquisition and standardized transfer of various types of data from German research vessels to hosts on land. Our concept towards nationwide common QA/QC procedures for various types of underway data (including versioning concept) and common workflows will also be presented. The “linking” of cruise-related information with quality-controlled data and data products (e. g., digital terrain models), publications, cruise-related reports, people and other contextual information will be additionally shown in the framework of a prototype for R.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is little}} {{research}} on consumer caffeine intake and no known studies measuring intake quantities in Australia. The relationship between personality and recreational {{drug use is}} well established although, to date, the research has not yet extended to other substances. This study aimed to determine Australians' use of caffeine (including knowledge about caffeine levels in various sources), alcohol, drugs and cognitive enhancers and determine any personality traits associated with their use. METHODS: After cleaning the data, 550 Australians aged 18 + (mean age of 40 years) completed an online survey that asked questions regarding use of caffeine, alcohol, drugs and cognitive enhancers. Frequency of use for different types of drug and cognitive enhancers was also established. Participants completed the Alcohol Use Identification Test and personality traits were measured using the NEO Personality <b>Inventory.</b> <b>SUMMARY</b> AND CONCLUSION: Australians are consuming caffeine within safe daily limits, with coffee being the main contributor to caffeine consumption. Participants are generally unaware of the caffeine content within products. Almost 30 % of participants binge drink on an average drinking occasion. Almost one quarter of participants had used illicit drugs, most commonly Cannabis, MDMA and ecstasy. Caffeine use, unlike other substance use, {{does not seem to}} be associated with personality traits. Future research should further examine the relationship of personality and substance choice using a larger n...|$|R
40|$|A <b>summary</b> of the <b>inventory</b> {{survey of}} Nigeria inland waters is presented. The survey reveals that Kano State tops {{the list in}} {{reservoir}} development with an existing water surface area of about 42, 773 ha, while Anambra State has the least with about 38 hectares. No reservoir was recorded for Lagos and Rivers States. However, in aspects of existing fish ponds, {{a total of about}} 471 ha was recorded for Plateau State and about 5 ha for Niger State. Preliminary estimates of Nigeria's fish yield potentials based on established production records of comparable water bodies in the tropics, at different levels of management, show that the available water mass in the country, estimated at about 12. 5 million hectares, could yield a minimum of about 334, 214 metric tonnes (m. t.) of fish per annum with little or no management and a maximum of about 511, 703 metric tonnes per annum with adequate management. Comparison of the potential yields from inland sources with the projected fish production in Nigeria (1981 - 1985) based on supply and demand statistics shows that potential yield from inland sources even at a low level of management is relatively higher than the projected inland production and more than double the observed production. The variation between the potential and the observed fish yields in the country has been attributed to the absolute lack of management strategies for our various inland waters. The paper elaborates on possible management strategies for various categories of inland waters as a prelude towards increased fish production in the countr...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Dendrochronological {{studies of}} bristlecone pine, Pinus lon aeva, have {{produced}} a continuous tree-ring se-quence back to 6700 BC for the White Mountains of Cali-fornia and to 3258 BC for east-central Nevada. Dendrochronological studies of bristlecone pine, Pinus lon aeva, at 10, 000 feet in the White Mountains of east-central California, {{have resulted in the}} establishment of a continuous tree-ring sequence back to 6700 BC, a total of 8681 years. This represents a 1576 -year extension of the chronology since it was last published (Ferguson, 1969; 1970). Given the quality and length of series of specimens that have recently been dated in the 5500 - 6500 BC range, we are cautiously optimistic that the chronology may eventually reach back at least 10, 000 years. This thought is but-tressed by the presence of a 500 -year "floating " sequence in the range of 9000 years BP (Ferguson, 1968). Current 14 C analysis seems to indicate that another remnant, collected in 1981, again with ca 500 rings, may be over 10, 000 years old (H N Michael, pers commun, 1982). Continuing tree-ring and 14 C studies will further define the temporal relation-ship of these two specimens. One other long bristlecone-pine chronology was recently developed. Collections at a site in the White Pine Range, east-central Nevada, have provided excellent material for a chronology back to 3258 BC, a total of 5238 years. This provides the second longest continuous record of isotopic and paleoclimatic variation at the lower, rainfall dependent range of the species. The historic development of the bristlecone-pine pro-ject, a general overview of its relation to other scientific activity and a <b>summary</b> of the <b>inventory</b> of prepared samples was recently presented by Ferguson (1979).

40|$|<b>Summary</b> The Personality <b>Inventory</b> for DSM- 5 (PID- 5; Krueger et al., 2012) is a self-report {{questionnaire}} that originates from the preparatory {{work of the}} DSM- 5 Task Force, aligning the classical DSM-IV-TR personality categories with a dimensional representation of personality pathology. Inspired by the non-clinical Five Factor Model (FFM; Costa & McCrae, 1992), its 25 primary scales {{have been reported to}} group into five higher order factors, each representing a pathological version of the classic five personality dimensions (i. e., Neuroticism, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness). The present PhD thesis contributes to the ongoing PID- 5 research by investigating the merits of the PID- 5 in a clinical population and its advantages over the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ; Livesley & Jackson, 2009) {{as a representative of the}} pathological four dimensional model (Openness not included). Indeed, whereas earlier studies have found solid pathological equivalents for four out of five of the classical Big Five personality dimensions, an unequivocal pathological version of the fifth personality dimension Openness, i. e. Psychoticism, remains subject of ongoing research. Also, the conceptual relationship between Psychoticism as a personality factor, syndromal psychosis and cognitive biases as an at-risk factor for syndromal psychosis warrants further investigation. In the present PhD thesis we will start from a separate psychometric evaluation of each of the new instruments that will be used in addressing our research questions. This will include the psychometric evaluation of the PID- 5 itself, as well as the psychometric evaluation of the Davos Assessment of Cognitive Biases Scale (DACOBS; van der Gaag et al., in press), an instrument measuring cognitive biases as a mediating personality trait in the development of syndromal psychosis. Thereafter, we will focus on the incremental validity of the fifth personality dimension Psychoticism (above and beyond the four other personality traits) in the prediction of (1) psychopathology in general, and (2) psychosis in particular, and on its conceptual relationship with cognitive biases as an at-risk factor for syndromal psychosis. status: accepte...|$|R
