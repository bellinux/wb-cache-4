25|$|While not {{on or near}} any {{fault line}} like San Francisco or Los Angeles, Mexico City is {{vulnerable}} to earthquakes. The main {{reason for this is}} the <b>surface</b> <b>geology</b> of the area, especially the downtown area. The city was originally built on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco, and Aztec rulers built dikes to prevent flooding while Spanish colonial rulers later drained the lakes in response to major flooding. The near <b>surface</b> <b>geology</b> of this area is classified into three sections: the old lake bed which is soft clay from volcanic ash with a high water content, a piedmont area, much of which is capped by 5 to 30 meters of lava less than 2,500 years old, and an old river delta area.|$|E

The definitive version is available at [URL] variation in landscape character {{has in the past}} been studied by archaeologists in terms of its physical manifestations such as different settlement patterns and field systems. Local and regional distinctiveness in landscape character also results from how rural communities practised different agricultural regimes, and historians have long recognised {{the extent to which these}} varied across the country. Archaeologists, in contrast, have compared the animal bones and cereal remains from sites of different socio-economic status, but have not previously focused on the extent to which they vary across different geologies. This paper therefore presents an analysis of the animal bones of the three main domesticates (cattle, sheep/goat and pig), and the charred grains of the four main cereal crops (bread wheat, barley, oats and rye), across a series of different <b>surface</b> <b>geologies</b> within a study area extending from East Anglia down to the South-West Peninsula. It shows that, first, patterns of animal husbandry and cereal cultivation varied considerably across different surface geologies; secondly that, while farming practices do appear to have been influenced by <b>surface</b> <b>geologies,</b> they were also affected by cultural factors, particularly as human communities responded to the opportunities of a growing market economy; and thirdly that, while archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological patterns evident in the mid- 11 th–mid- 14 th centuries conform with what documentary sources tell us, the particular importance of this archaeological dataset is that it allows us to reconstruct farming regimes back into the undocumented early medieval (and indeed earlier) periods.

40|$|Several {{geological}} events occurred onthe {{surface of}} the earth with the division of the megacontinent Gondwana, including volcanic activity involving extensive lava flows, thus locally and regionally altering the <b>surface's</b> <b>geology.</b> Lava flows in the Serra Geral formation predominantly consist of volcanic lava fissure-derived basalt. Sedimentation upon extrusive igneous rocks occurred after this volcanic event, leading to the deposition of sediments from three formations (Adamantina, Uberaba, and Marília) collectively comprising the upper Cretaceous Bauru group, beginning about 83 million years ago. This was a period when large animals inhabited the planet, including the study area; the Adamantina formation is the largest and oldest.

25|$|The {{basin and}} range {{topography}} of northern Nevada and the extensive and flat Snake River Plain characterize the geologically young Salmon Falls Creek basin. The Basin and Range area {{was created by}} crustal stretching along an area dense in faults running north to south, with valleys forming along the fault lines. Sediments deposited by streams and lakes in the Pliocene and Miocene filled much of the present-day main stem valley. Lower on the creek, basalt rocks of volcanic origin and thick deposits of loess soil compose the primary <b>surface</b> <b>geology.</b> Beginning about 12 million years ago, the North American Plate slowly passed over a large volcanic hotspot, which formed and caused frequent volcanic activity throughout the Snake River Plain. The hotspot, which now lies beneath Yellowstone National Park, deposited massive lava flows throughout the plain. About 14,500 years ago, the Bonneville Flood rushed through the Snake River Plain, carving out and extending many canyons including lower Salmon Falls Creek Canyon. The extent of the floods {{was so great that}} most of lower Salmon Falls Creek pooled up into a temporary lake as miles of land were submerged {{on both sides of the}} Snake. Wind-blown soil and sediment deposited by the floods have covered most of the basalt, which is still exposed in areas such as Salmon Falls Creek Canyon.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the state}} {{no longer has}} true {{mountain}} ranges or oceans, there is {{a fair amount of}} regional diversity in landforms and geological history, which in turn has affected Minnesota's settlement patterns, human history, and economic development. These diverse geological regions can be classified several ways. [...] The classification used below principally derives from Sansome's Minnesota Underfoot - A Field Guide to Minnesota's Geology, but is also influenced by Minnesota's Geology by Ojakangas and Matsch. [...] These authorities generally agree on areal borders, but the regions as defined by Ojakangas and Matsch are more geographical in their approximations of areas of similar geology, while Sansome's divisions are more irregular in shape in order to include within a region all areas of similar geology, with particular emphasis on the effects of recent glaciation. [...] As glaciation and its residue has largely dictated regional <b>surface</b> <b>geology</b> and topography, Sansome's divisions are often coextensive with ecological provinces, sections, and subsections.|$|E

Study focusThe As {{contamination}} {{was investigated}} through the geochemical mapping {{and analysis of}} river waters and bed sediments over an area of 440 km 2. Sulfur from sulfides in rocks and dissolved sulfates in water were compared via isotopic analysis to assess their origin and the subsequently released As. The fate of As (transport, binding on settling particles) was evaluated through the total and dissolved fractions of As and trace metals Fe, Mn and Al in river waters. New hydrological insights for the regionThe geochemical mapping showed that As in river water exceeded the maximum limit concentration of 10 ppb in several places. The highest As levels (waters and sediments) correlated well with the <b>surface</b> <b>geologies,</b> concentrating in a halo around granitic intrusion and nearby faults. The isotopic analysis of sulfur revealed the occurrence of two kinds of sulfide mineralizations responsible for As contamination: one from Late Paleozoic submarine volcanism in sedimentary rocks, and one from Late Cretaceous igneous activities in contact-metamorphosed rocks disseminated with sulfides. The transport of As along river courses occurred mainly as a dissolved species rather than absorbed on Fe/Mn/Al particles, signifying the least role of iron oxy-hydroxides in As adsorption...|$|R

40|$|Notwithstanding, {{the severe}} {{environmental}} conditions, deserts harbour a high diversity of adapted micro-organisms. In such oligotrophic environments, soil physicochemical characteristics {{play an important}} role in shaping indigenous microbial communities. This study investigates the edaphic bacterial communities of three contrasting desert terrain types (gravel plains, sand dunes and ephemeral rivers) with different <b>surface</b> <b>geologies</b> in the Central Namib Desert. For each site, we evaluated surface soil physicochemistries and used explorative T-RFLP methodology to get an indication of bacterial community diversities. While grain size was an important parameter in separating the three terrain types physicochemically and specific surface soil types could be distinguished, the desert edaphic bacterial communities displayed a high level of local spatial heterogeneity. Ten variables contributed significantly (P < 0. 05) to the variance in the T-RFLP data sets: fine silt, medium and fine sand content, pH, S, Na, Zn, Al, V and Fe concentrations, and 40 % of the total variance could be explained by these constraining variables. The results suggest that local physicochemical conditions play a significant role in shaping the bacterial structures in the Central Namib Desert and stress the importance of recording a wide variety of environmental descriptors to comprehensively assess the role of edaphic parameters in shaping microbial communities.

This report contains information on characteristic wildlife communities, their habitat requirements and the ecological impact of activities that are relevant to the chalk river environment. It provides guidance on setting management objectives, options for mitigating impacts, and measures for the maintaining and enhancing the river channel, riparian and floodplain areas associated. The term `chalk river’ is used to describe watercourses dominated by groundwater discharge from chalk geology, including those that flow over a range of non-chalk <b>surface</b> <b>geologies</b> at various points along their length. England contains numerous examples of this river type, located in and downstream of areas of outcropping chalk in the south, East Anglia and up into Lincolnshire and Yorkshire.
