5000|$|Optogenetics {{provides}} millisecond-scale temporal precision {{which allows}} the experimenter {{to keep pace with}} fast biological information processing (for example, in probing the causal role of <b>specific</b> <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> patterns in defined neurons). Indeed, to probe the neural code, optogenetics by definition must operate on the millisecond timescale to allow addition or deletion of precise activity patterns within specific cells in the brains of intact animals, including mammals (see Figure 1). By comparison, the temporal precision of traditional genetic manipulations (employed to probe the causal role of specific genes within cells, via [...] "loss-of-function" [...] or [...] "gain of function" [...] changes in these genes) is rather slow, from hours or days to months. It is important to also have fast readouts in optogenetics that can keep pace with the optical control. This can be done with electrical recordings ("optrodes") or with reporter proteins that are biosensors, where scientists have fused fluorescent proteins to detector proteins. An example of this is voltage-sensitive fluorescent protein (VSFP2). Additionally, beyond its scientific impact optogenetics represents an important case study in the value of both ecological conservation (as many of the key tools of optogenetics arise from microbial organisms occupying specialized environmental niches), and in the importance of pure basic science as these opsins were studied over decades for their own sake by biophysicists and microbiologists, without involving consideration of their potential value in delivering insights into neuroscience and neuropsychiatric disease.'''''' ...|$|E

40|$|Perception of the {{environment}} relies on somatosensory neurons. Mechanosensory, proprioceptor and many nociceptor subtypes of these neurons have specific mechanosensitivity profiles to adequately differentiate stimulus patterns. Nevertheless, the cellular basis of differential mechanosensation remains largely elusive. Successful transduction of sensory information relies on the recruitment of sensory neurons and mechanosensation occurring at their peripheral axonal endings in vivo. Conspicuously, existing in vitro models aimed to decipher molecular mechanisms of mechanosensation test single sensory neuron somata at any one time. Here, we introduce a compartmental in vitro chamber design to deliver precisely controlled mechanical stimulation of sensory axons with synchronous real-time imaging of Ca 2 + transients in neuronal somata that reliably reflect action potential firing patterns. We report of three previously not characterized types of mechanosensitive neuron subpopulations with distinct intrinsic axonal properties tuned specifically to static indentation or vibration stimuli, showing that different classes of sensory neurons are tuned to specific types of mechanical stimuli. Primary receptor currents of vibration neurons display rapidly adapting conductance reliably detected for every single stimulus during vibration and are consistently converted into action potentials. This result allows for the characterization of two critical steps of mechanosensation in vivo: primary signal detection and signal conversion into <b>specific</b> <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> firing patterns in axons...|$|E

However, improved understanding of this variability is key to enable prediction of the response of specific hearts to disease and therapies. Limitations of current mathematical modeling and experimental techniques hamper our ability to provide insight into variability. Here we describe a methodology to unravel the ionic determinants of inter-subject variability exhibited in experimental recordings, based on the construction and calibration of populations of models. We illustrate the methodology through its application to rabbit Purkinje preparations, due to their importance in arrhythmias and safety pharmacology assessment. We consider a set of equations describing the biophysical processes underlying rabbit Purkinje electrophysiology and we construct a population of over 10, 000 models by randomly assigning specific parameter values corresponding to ionic current conductances and kinetics. We calibrate the model population by closely comparing simulation output and experimental recordings at three pacing frequencies. We show that 213 of the 10, 000 candidate models are fully consistent with the experimental dataset. Ionic properties in the 213 models cover a wide range of values, including differences up to Â± 100 % in several conductances. Partial correlation analysis shows that particular combinations of ionic properties determine the precise shape, amplitude and rate dependence of <b>specific</b> <b>action</b> <b>potentials.</b> Finally, we demonstrate that the population of models calibrated using data obtained under physiological conditions quantitatively predicts the <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> duration prolongation caused by exposure to four concentrations of the potassium channel blocker dofetilide...|$|R
40|$|The {{cerebral}} cortex {{is characterized by}} multiple layers and many distinct cell-types that together as a network are responsible for many higher cognitive functions including decision making, sensory-guided behavior or memory. To understand how such intricate neuronal networks perform such tasks, a crucial step {{is to determine the}} function (or electrical activity) of individual cell types within the network, preferentially when the animal is performing a relevant cognitive task. Additionally, it is equally important to determine the anatomical structure of the network and the morphological architecture of the individual neurons to allow reverse engineering the cortical network. Technical breakthroughs available today allow recording cellular activity in awake, behaving animals with the valuable option of post hoc identifying the recorded neurons. Here, we demonstrate the juxtasomal biocytin labeling technique, which involves recording action potential spiking in the extracellular (or loose-patch) configuration using conventional patch pipettes The juxtasomal recording configuration is relatively stable and applicable across behavioral conditions, including anesthetized, sedated, awake head-fixed, and even in the freely moving animal.

In about 20 % of the Brugada affected patients, mutations have been identified in the gene encoding the Na+ ion channel, SCN 5 A. Up to now, genotype-phenotype studies have been performed using heterologous expression systems that lack the correct cellular context of a cardiomyocyte. Human Induced Pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) offer a now new paradigm for gene mutation characterization.

Methods and resultshiPSCs from a Brugada affected patient carrying the N 1722 D mutation in SCN 5 A have been generated and validated. hiPSCs from a healthy subject were used as control. Using patch clamp techniques, the biophysical properties of the Na+ channel and action potential characteristics were evaluated in both cardiomyocytes differentiated from these hiPSCs and in a mammalian expression system expressing the mutant channel. Preliminary data from both cellular models suggest a three-times reduction in Na+ current.

We used viral synaptophysin-enhanced green fluorescent protein expression in thalamic neurons and reconstructions of biocytin-labeled cortical neurons in TC slices to quantify the number and distribution of boutons from the ventral posterior medial (VPM) and posteromedial (POm) nuclei potentially innervating dendritic arbors of excitatory neurons located in layers (L) 2 - 6 of a cortical column in rat somatosensory cortex. We found that 1) all types of excitatory neurons potentially receive substantial TC input (90 - 580 boutons per neuron); 2) pyramidal neurons in L 3 -L 6 receive dual TC input from both VPM and POm that is potentially of equal magnitude for thick-tufted L 5 pyramidal neurons (ca. 300 boutons each from VPM and POm); 3) L 3, L 4, and L 5 pyramidal neurons have multiple (2 - 4) subcellular TC innervation domains that match the dendritic compartments of pyramidal cells; and 4) a subtype of thick-tufted L 5 pyramidal neurons has an additional VPM innervation domain in L 4. The multiple subcellular TC innervation domains of L 5 pyramidal neurons may partly explain their <b>specific</b> <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> patterns observed in vivo.

We applied standard microelectrode recording and whole-cell patch-clamp to evaluate action potentials and ionic currents in canine PVs and left atrium (LA) free wall. Resting membrane potential (RMP) averaged â 66 Â± 1 mV in PVs and â 74 Â± 1 mV in LA (P < 0. 0001) and action potential amplitude averaged 76 Â± 2 mV in PVs vs. 95 Â± 2 mV in LA (P < 0. 0001). PVs had smaller maximum phase 0 upstroke velocity (Vmax: 98 Â± 9 vs. 259 Â± 16 V sâ 1, P < 0. 0001) and action potential duration (APD) : e. g. at 2 Hz, APD to 90 % repolarization in PVs was 84 % of LA (P < 0. 05). Na+ current density under voltage-clamp conditions was similar in PV and LA, suggesting that smaller Vmax in PVs was due to reduced RMP. Inward rectifier current density in the PV cardiomyocytes was Ë 58 % that in the LA, potentially accounting for the less negative RMP in PVs. Slow and rapid delayed rectifier currents were greater in the PV (by Ë 60 and Ë 50 %, respectively), whereas transient outward K+ current and L-type Ca 2 + current were significantly smaller (by Ë 25 and Ë 30 %, respectively).

The present study addressed regionally defined differential ion-channel expression in the non-diseased human heart with a genomic approach. High-throughput real-time RT-PCR was used to quantify the expression patterns of 79 ion-channel subunit transcripts and related genes in atria, ventricular epicardium and endocardium, and Purkinje fibres isolated from 15 non-diseased human donor hearts. Two-way non-directed hierarchical clustering separated atria, Purkinje fibre and ventricular compartments, but did not show specific patterns for epicardium versus endocardium, nor left- versus right-sided chambers. Genes that characterized the atria (versus ventricles) included Cx 40, Kv 1. 5 and Kir 3. 1 as expected, but also Cav 1. 3, Cav 3. 1, CavÎ± 2 Î´ 2, NavÎ² 1, TWIK 1, TASK 1 and HCN 4. Only Kir 2. 1, RyR 2, phospholamban and Kv 1. 4 showed higher expression in the ventricles.

5000|$|Since the CTZ {{is located}} in the medulla oblongata, it {{therefore}} does not have a specific Blood-brain barrier. This means that large polar molecules, such as emetic toxins, can diffuse through to and reach the CTZ quite easily. This is because the medulla oblongata {{is located in}} the area of the brain, the most inferior portion, which does not have a robust and highly developed blood-brain barrier. Without this barrier, emetic drugs and toxins are free to interact with a receptor (biochemistry), or multiple receptors located in the CTZ. These receptors in the CTZ are called chemoreceptors because they interact with different types of chemicals which are usually referred to as neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters implement their effects on the CTZ receptors by binding to them which sets off a chain of events which produces an <b>action</b> <b>potential.</b> Studies have shown that neurons in the CTZ increase their rate of firing when exposed to emetic substances. The CTZ has many different types of receptors, which are specific to different types of toxins or drugs that might be present in the bloodstream and thus that can affect the CTZ. Types of CTZ receptors include dopamine, serotonin, histamine, substance P, opioid, and acetylcholine receptors. It has been discovered that the cholinergic neurons are actually nicotinic. These receptors are meant to monitor the amount of associated neurotransmitter of these receptors in the blood. For instance, the CTZ has opioid receptors that monitor the level of opioids in the blood, and when the amount of opioids in the blood reach a certain level, the opioid receptors in the CTZ will signal to the rest of the vomiting center to initiate vomiting. This is because the CTZ sends the [...] "vomit" [...] command through <b>action</b> <b>potentials,</b> and these <b>specific</b> <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> that trigger emesis are only produced when a certain amount of opioids bind to a certain amount of opioid receptors in the CTZ. Neurons in the CTZ, and area postrema in general, actually have two types of receptors: those at the surface of the neuron and those that are located deeper down in the dendrites. The receptors on the surface of the neuron are chemoreceptors that are activated from direct contact of emetic substances in the blood, whereas the receptors that are deeper down on the dendrites are receptors that are activated in response to the activated chemoreceptors on the surface.|$|R

Using patch-clamp techniques and fluorescent Ca 2 + indicators (microfluorimetry) allowing the measurement of the cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration under well-defined experimental conditions, we have analyzed the mechanisms underlying the [Ca 2 +]i transient in single cardiac myocytes. We conclude that in mammalian cardiac myocytes Ca 2 + release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is the main source of Ca 2 + for activation of the myofilaments. Our results further show that the Ca 2 + release channel of the SR is directly gated by Ca 2 + influx through L-type Ca 2 + channels that open during the <b>action</b> <b>potential.</b> Ca 2 + influx via other pathways including the Na(+) -Ca 2 + exchanger and T-type Ca 2 + channels does not {{play a significant role in}} triggering Ca 2 + release from the SR.

40|$|The unusual {{kinetics}} {{of human}} ether-Ã -go-go-related gene (HERG) K+ channels {{are consistent with}} {{a role in the}} suppression of arrhythmias initiated by premature beats. <b>Action</b> <b>potential</b> clamp protocols were used to investigate the effect of premature stimulation on HERG K+ channels, transfected in Chinese hamster ovary cells, at 37 Â°C. HERG K+ channel currents peaked during the terminal repolarization phase of normally paced <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> waveforms. However, the magnitude of the current and the time point at which conductance was maximal depended on the type of <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> waveform used (epicardial, endocardial, Purkinje fibre or atrial). HERG K+ channel currents recorded during premature <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> consisted of an early transient outward current followed by a sustained outward current. The magnitude of the transient current component showed a biphasic dependence on the coupling interval between the normally paced and premature <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> and was maximal at a coupling interval equivalent to 90 % repolarization (APD 90) for ventricular <b>action</b> <b>potentials.</b> The largest transient current response occurred at shorter coupling intervals for Purkinje fibre (APD 90 â 20 ms) and atrial (APD 90 â 30 ms) <b>action</b> <b>potentials.</b> The magnitude of the sustained current response following premature stimulation was similar to that recorded during the first <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> for ventricular <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> waveforms. However, for Purkinje and atrial <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> the sustained current response was significantly larger during the premature <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> than during the normally paced <b>action</b> <b>potential.</b> A Markov model that included three closed states, one open and one inactivated state with transitions permitted between the pre-open closed state and the inactivated state, successfully reproduced our results for the effects of premature stimuli, both during square pulse and <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> clamp waveforms. These properties of HERG K+ channels may help to suppress arrhythmias initiated by early afterdepolarizations and premature beats in the ventricles, Purkinje fibres or atria...|$|R
50|$|The digital-like {{uniformity}} of <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> is contradicted by experimental data. Electrophysiologists {{have observed that}} the shape of recorded <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> changes in time. Recent experimental evidence has shown that <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> in neurons are subject to waveform modulation while they travel down axons or dendrites. The <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> waveform can be modulated by neuron geometry, local alterations in the ion conductance, and other biophysical properties including neurotransmitter release.|$|R

Therefore, we have investigated the properties of <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> thresholds for hippocampal neurons using in vivo intracellular recording methods in Sprague^Dawley rats. The use of in vivo recording {{has the advantage of}} the presence of naturally occurring spatio-temporal patterns of synaptic activity which lead to <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> initiation. We have found there is a large variability in the threshold voltage (5. 7 Ã¾ 1. 7 mV; n = 22) of individual <b>action</b> <b>potentials.</b> We have identiÂ¢ed two separate factors that contribute to this variation in threshold: (1) fast rates of membrane potential change prior to the <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> are associated with more hyperpolarized thresholds (increased excitability) and (2) the occurrence of other <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> in the 1 s prior to any given <b>action</b> <b>potential</b> is associated with more depolarized thresholds (decreased excitability). We suggest that prior <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> cause sodium channel inactivation that recovers with approximately a 1 -s tim...|$|R
