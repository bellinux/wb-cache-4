50|$|Inwale - The upper, inner {{longitudinal}} {{structural member}} of the hull, to which topside panels are fixed. In USA this is usually called the <b>sheer</b> <b>clamp.</b>|$|E
50|$|Carlin - A {{longitudinal}} strip parallel to, but inboard of, the inwale (<b>sheer</b> <b>clamp).</b> It {{supports the}} inboard {{edge of the}} side deck and {{the side of the}} cabin cladding.|$|E
5000|$|Built in Bristol, Rhode Island, in 1905, by the Herreshoff Manufacturing Co., Doris is {{the largest}} all-wood vessel ever built by the firm. [...] The ship was {{commissioned}} by S. Reed Anthony, a founding partner of investment banking firm Tucker, Anthony & Co., who paid $18,000. [...] She soon proved her worth, as Doris [...] "... {{proved to be a}} sensation in the yachting world when she defeated Gloriana, an earlier Herreshoff design built in 1891 and reported to be the fastest sailing vessel of her day, in a series of match races off Marblehead, Massachusetts." [...] The ship is also unusual for two construction details. Herreshoff employed metal hanging knees instead of the more traditional <b>sheer</b> <b>clamp,</b> and Doris is the only boat to possess what Herreshoff called [...] "belt" [...] or [...] "web frames", whereby oak frames were bent [...] "over the ceiling".|$|E
50|$|Breasthook - A roughly {{triangular}} {{piece of}} wood fitted immediately aft of the stem and between the two inwales or <b>sheer</b> <b>clamps</b> usually in a wooden dinghy.|$|R
5000|$|Sheet plywood boat {{building}} uses {{sheets of}} plywood panels usually fixed to longitudinal long wood such the chines, inwhales (<b>sheer</b> <b>clamps)</b> or intermediate stringers {{which are all}} bent around a series of frames. By attaching the ply sheets to the longwood rather than directly to the frames this avoids hard spots or an unfair hull. Plywood may be laminated into a round hull or used in single sheets. These hulls generally have one or more chines and the method is called Ply on Frame construction. A subdivision of the sheet plywood boat building method {{is known as the}} stitch-and-glue method, where pre-shaped panels of plywood are drawn together then edge glued and reinforced with fibreglass without the use of a frame. Metal or plastic ties, nylon fishing line or copper wires pull curved flat panels into three-dimensional curved shapes. These hulls generally have one or more chines. Marine grade plywood of good quality is designated [...] "WBP" [...] (which stands for water- and boiled-proof) or more usually BS 1088. Australian plywood manufacturers and suppliers have issued warnings that some Asian nations are selling ply stamped BS 1088 which does not meet international standards. Specifically, they say outer plies are too thin (should be 1.2 mm minimum) or are very thin (less than 0.5 mm) or high-grade surface ply such as Okoume is combined with a much heavier and wider inner cores. Most high-grade marine Okoume (Gaboon) ply uses lightweight poplar inner cores. Often the 1088 stamp is blurred in the poor Asian ply so it is not clear. In Australia and New Zealand a higher-grade marine ply than BS1088 is AS2272. It requires both faces to be [...] "A" [...] quality, with even-thickness plies. The most common plywood used for this grade is plantation-grown Hoop Pine which is fine grained, very smooth, moderately light (at [...] it is the same weight as Meranti ply and about 13% heavier than genuine poplar cored BS1088 Okoume). Hoop pine has a very high stress rating of F17, indicating high strength. Meranti (Lauan) ply has a stress rating of F14 and Okoume ply F8. Okoume ply is commonly coated with epoxy to increase strength and impact resistance as well as to exclude water. Both types of plywood construction are very popular with amateur builders, and many dinghies such as the Vaurien, Cherub, Tolman, Moth and P class (ply on frame construction) and FJs, FDs and Kolibris (stitch-and-glue method) have been built from it. Another variation is tortured ply where very thin(3 mm) and flexible (often Okoume)preshaped panels ply are bent into compound curves and sewn together. Little or no framework or longitudinal wood is used. This method is mainly confined to kayaks.|$|R
