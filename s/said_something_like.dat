"Thinking {{back to when}} we met and {{the many}} times that we spent {{together}} and whenever we were out together, {{there would be a}} caption of some kind, and the caption usually <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> 'an odd couple' or 'an unlikely pair,' but to us it was the most natural and easiest of friendships.... Michael always knew he could count on me to support him or be his date and that we would have fun no matter where we were. We had a bond.... Both of us needed to be adults very early, but when we were together, we were two little kids having fun." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the song}} [...] "Yonkers", Tyler, The Creator disparages {{numerous}} artists, including Bruno Mars. Tyler also disparages Mars in The Game's song [...] "Martians vs. Goblins", {{in which he}} and Lil Wayne are featured artists. Mars, {{in response to the}} verse [...] "stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus," [...] said [...] " [...] has to wait in line if he wants to stab me... definitely not the first guy that's <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that to me and he's {{not going to be the}} last". On April 24, 2015, Tyler admitted to being wrong regarding Mars' talent and pointed to Mars performance of [...] "Gorilla" [...] at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards as evidence.|$|E
500|$|Before each segment, {{there are}} {{trailers}} advertising fake films, {{as well as}} vintage theater snipes and an ad for a fictional restaurant called Acuña Boys. According to Rodriguez, it was Tarantino's idea to film fake trailers for Grindhouse. [...] "I didn't even know about it until I {{read it in the}} trades. It <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> 'Rodriguez and Tarantino doing a double feature and Tarantino says there's gonna be fake trailers.' And I thought, 'There are?'" [...] Rodriguez and Tarantino had originally planned to make all of the film's fake trailers themselves. According to Rodriguez, [...] "We had so many ideas for trailers. I made Machete. I shot lobby cards and the poster and cut the trailer and sent it to Quentin, and he just flipped out because it looked so vintage and so real. He started showing it around to Eli Roth and to Edgar Wright, and they said, 'Can we do a trailer? We have an idea for a trailer!' We were like, 'Hey, let them shoot it. If we don't get around to shooting ours, we'll put theirs in the movie. If theirs come out really great, we'll put it in the movie to have some variety.' Then Rob Zombie came up to me in October at the Scream Awards and said, 'I have a trailer: Werewolf Women of the SS.' I said, 'Say no more. Go shoot it. You got me.'" [...] Each trailer was shot in two days. While Wright and Roth shot only what ended up on screen, Zombie shot enough footage to work into a half-hour film and was particularly pained to edit it down. Some Canadian screening releases included the South by Southwest-winning trailer Hobo with a Shotgun.|$|E

2500|$|... "Everyone to {{whom the}} problem was put (myself included) <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> 'that is not my area but the {{question}} surely must have been considered {{and the answer is}} probably well known.' Some thought they had seen it, but could not remember where. I was interested because it reminded me of Sperner's Lemma in topology, which has a clever odd-even proof." ...|$|E
2500|$|Representative Smith {{told the}} Investigative Subcommittee that Representative Miller {{specifically}} threatened {{to work against}} his son {{if he did not}} change his vote. Representative Smith’s recollection was that Representative Miller [...] "came up and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>like,</b> I haven't been involved in this campaign before, but if you don't change your vote, I'll get involved, and I'll make sure Brad isn't elected." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Basie {{took his}} {{orchestra}} to New York in 1937, {{they made the}} Woodside Hotel in Harlem their base (they often rehearsed in its basement). Soon, they were booked at the Roseland Ballroom for the Christmas show. Basie recalled a review, which <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "We caught the great Count Basie band {{which is supposed to}} be so hot he was going {{to come in here and}} set the Roseland on fire. [...] Well, the Roseland is still standing". Compared to the reigning band of Fletcher Henderson, Basie's band lacked polish and presentation.|$|E

5000|$|Oriah's Story, who {{explains}} that he became violent and, in a rage, assaulted his mother. He <b>said</b> that <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that you can't take back, and can't forgive himself for doing said action.|$|R

2500|$|Executives from Universal, {{including}} Lew Wasserman and Sid Sheinberg, {{were not}} very enthusiastic. [...] "I think they were shocked," [...] recalled Spikings. [...] "What really upset them was 'God Bless America'. Sheinberg thought it was anti-American. He was vehement. He <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> 'You're poking a stick {{in the eye of}} America.' They really didn't like the movie. And they certainly didn't like it at three hours and two minutes." [...] Deeley wasn't surprised by the Universal response: [...] "The Deer Hunter was a United Artists sort of picture, whereas Convoy was more in the style of Universal. I'd muddled and sold the wrong picture to each studio." [...] Deeley did agree with Universal that the film needed to be shorter, not just because of pacing but also to ensure commercial success. [...] "A picture under {{two and a half hours}} can scrape three shows a day," [...] wrote Deeley, [...] "but at three hours you've lost one third of your screenings and one third of your income for the cinemas, distributors, and profit participants." ...|$|E
2500|$|Starting in the 1970s, the Bronx often symbolized violence, decay, {{and urban}} ruin. The wave of arson in the South Bronx in the 1960s and 1970s {{inspired}} {{the observation that}} [...] "The Bronx is burning": in 1974 it was the title of both a New York Times editorial and a BBC documentary film. The line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the 1977 World Series, when a fire broke out near Yankee Stadium as the team was playing the Los Angeles Dodgers. Numerous fires had previously broken out in the Bronx prior to this fire. As the fire was captured on live television, announcer Howard Cosell is wrongly remembered to have <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "There it is, ladies and gentlemen: the Bronx is burning". Historians of New York City frequently point to Cosell's remark as an acknowledgement of both {{the city and the}} borough's decline. A new feature-length documentary film by Edwin Pagan called Bronx Burning is in production in 2006, chronicling what led up to the numerous arson-for-insurance fraud fires of the 1970s in the borough.|$|E

6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] <b>said</b> Dr. Boomer--and <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a smile passed {{across his}} {{features}} {{for a moment}} [...] "Dr. Dumfarthing had already sent away his telegram of acceptance." ...|$|R

6000|$|She looked {{round at}} him. [...] "You <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> {{that when you}} were delirious," [...] she answered, after a little pause. [...] "It's one of the ideas that you're {{struggling}} with. You go on, old man, and talk. We've months--for repetitions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} is," [...] he answered. [...] "I {{believe you}} have already <b>said</b> <b>something</b> very much <b>like</b> your last remark. Still, you see, I don't propose to come often." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very conscientious, I have no doubt," [...] <b>said</b> Lucy, with <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a sneer in her tone. [...] "But the question, I suppose, is, whether Lord Lufton likes her." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was {{impossible}} to be melancholy in this man's company. Amelius sanctioned {{the return of the}} Tourne-dos, and tried the other glass of claret.

Let's hear what your experience has been." ...|$|R
6000|$|She <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this to Beaton. He answered: [...] "You {{can meet}} the people I'm talking of very easily, {{if you want to}} take the trouble. It's what they came to New York for. I fancy it's the great {{ambition}} of their lives to be met." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bailey so far forgot {{himself as}} to swear. [...] "Just as things were getting lively!" [...] he <b>said.</b> <b>Something</b> <b>like</b> a woman's shriek {{came through the}} air.

6000|$|He {{told some}} of the legends, {{and said that they}} were implicitly {{believed}} by all classes of Hindoos, including those of high social position and intelligence; and he said that this universal credulity was a great hindrance to the missionary in his work.
