5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which a polyubiquitinated protein is targeted to the proteasome is not fully understood. Ubiquitin-receptor proteins have an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and one or more ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains. The UBL domains are recognized by the 19S proteasome caps and the UBA domains bind ubiquitin via three-helix bundles. These receptor proteins may escort polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome, though the <b>specifics</b> of this interaction and its regulation are unclear.|$|E

5|$|There are {{numerous}} versions of Krishna's life story, of which three are most studied: the Harivamsa, the Bhagavata Purana, and the Vishnu Purana. They share the basic storyline but vary significantly in their <b>specifics,</b> details, and styles.

It ends on a triumphal note, not {{with the death of}} Krishna. Differing in some details, the fifth book of the Vishnu Purana moves away from Harivamsa realism and embeds Krishna in mystical terms and eulogies.

During his assignment with this regiment, he saw {{service in the}} last years of the Seven Years' War (1765–1763) in the Bohemian theatre. The lack of accurate maps had hampered the conduct of the Seven Years' War and, in 1764, Schmitt was assigned to a project to improve the map-making capacity of the military. The idea of the scientific soldier, or a soldier educated in the <b>specifics</b> of military operations, led to an investment in the training and education of officers. The development of map making, and Carlos Pallavicini was at the forefront of this movement.

Meanwhile, Innocent had changed his mind, and reinstalled Savaric as abbot, ordering some English clergy to judge the <b>specifics</b> of the case, and allot the revenues of the abbey between Savaric and the monks.

Frank said he was not familiar with the name Mary Phagan and would need to check his payroll book.
