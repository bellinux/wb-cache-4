5|$|In Mexico, the {{hurricane}} resulted in $3million in damage (1992USD, $4.7million 2011USD). It also left 5,000people homeless, and {{was responsible for}} three fatalities. The remnants of Lester also produced moderate rainfall and minor flooding across southern California, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico, as well as rare August <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rocky Mountains.|$|E
5|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city is so {{rare that}} it has been {{observed}} only five times in the century-and-a-half that records have been kept. In 1949 and 1967, snow stayed on the ground for a few hours in higher locations like Point Loma and La Jolla. The other three occasions, in 1882, 1946, and 1987, involved flurries but no accumulation.|$|E
25|$|The {{winter of}} 2006–2007 {{was marked by}} heavy poaching. Poaching of tigers and their wild prey species is {{considered}} to be driving the decline, although heavy <b>snows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter of 2009 could have biased the data.|$|R
500|$|The Table Rocks {{experience}} a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area {{is less than}} , and the annual precipitation is approximately [...] due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains. It rarely <b>snows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter.|$|R
50|$|Alpine lakes such as Dashueiku (大水窟), Tafen Pond (塔芬池), Jiaming Lake (嘉明湖), and Tienchih (天池) {{are formed}} from rain and melting <b>snows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadows of {{surrounding}} mountain peaks. These lakes provide animals including visitors precious {{water from the}} mountains. However, the ecosystem around them is fragile and need further protection.|$|R
5|$|The {{hot springs}} along the Chikuma River for example from {{tourists}} {{into the upper}} reaches of the river. The high rate of <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains surrounding both the Chikuma and Shinano Rivers make them attractive places for snow sports with a number of ski resorts scattered throughout the mountains. The 1998 Winter Olympics, which were held in Nagano, indicate the large number of locations for snow sports in the area.|$|E
5|$|At bedtime on Christmas Eve, {{the family}} makes last-minute {{preparations}} at home, Marge tells everyone {{that no one}} can open presents until 7 AM and confiscates all of the alarm clocks. However, Bart drinks 12 glasses of water to wake up early and secretly unwraps his gifts, one of which is a remote-controlled fire truck. Bart plays with it until it sprays water on an overloaded electrical socket, causing a fire that engulfs and melts the plastic Christmas tree and all of the presents beneath it. Bart hides the evidence outside beneath the <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front yard.|$|E
5|$|While Marge and the {{children}} are enjoying dinner, Homer begins pursuing the family with an axe and Bart uses his powers to call Willie, who immediately runs to the family's rescue, abandoning his portable television in the <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. Homer kills him by striking {{him in the back}} with the axe. Homer pursues his family outside but as he is about to kill them, Lisa discovers Willie's abandoned television. Homer's insanity gradually decreases and the family freezes in the snow as they are watching.|$|E

40|$|Based on MODIS data, we {{analyzed}} the spatial distribution and the intra- and inter-annual variations of <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> cover <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Qilian Mountains. <b>In</b> addition to discussing regional climate, {{we discussed the}} reasons for the snow cover pattern variations. The spatial distribution of <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> cover <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Qilian Mountains is uneven, and <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> cover <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west is significantly greater than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east. <b>The</b> difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intra-annual variations of the snow cover at different altitudes is large, and the general seasonal cycle exhibits two maxima and one minimum. The snow cover and precipitation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Qilian Mountains were consistently increasing from 2000 to 2005, but they generally decreased from 2008 to 2013. The influences of temperature, wind speeds and precipitations on snow cover variation at different altitudes vary greatly, with the snow cover being more sensitive to precipitation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter, while temperature and precipitation are the major factors that affect <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> cover <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring...|$|R
5|$|From {{the initial}} {{planning}} stages, proponents and opponents {{speculated that the}} large size of the reservoir created by the dam could affect the weather in Interior Alaska and the Yukon. Several studies were conducted in regards to these potential changes, {{and most of the}} reports hypothesized an effect similar to the weather that occurs around Great Slave Lake and Lake Baikal, both of which were of similar sizes and latitudes to the proposed reservoir. Forecasts predicted the lake would hold in heat longer during the autumn, thus keeping area temperatures slightly warmer than normal. In the spring, however, the area around the lake would have been prone to increased precipitation due to the phenomenon of lake-effect <b>snow.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> summer, the long periods of daylight would have caused the land around the lake to become warmer than the lake itself, also creating the possibility of storms.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Merced River basin is at high elevation, {{where an}} alpine climate prevails. The Sierra {{receives}} heavy snowfall in the winter, which melts {{in the spring}} and early summer causing annual flooding. By late autumn the river level has dropped considerably, and some smaller tributaries dry up altogether. Up to 85% of the flow above Happy Isles comes from melting <b>snow.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> dry season, groundwater provides the only base flow to the river. In addition, the river is fed by dozens of high Sierra lakes, the largest of which include Merced Lake, Tenaya Lake, Ostrander Lake, the Chain Lakes, and May Lake. The foothills experience a drier Mediterranean climate, while the San Joaquin Valley floor is dry enough to be considered semi-desert.|$|E
5|$|There is also {{an older}} {{downtown}} grid system {{that was designed to}} be parallel to the confluence of the South Platte River and Cherry Creek. Most of the streets downtown and in LoDo run northeast–southwest and northwest–southeast. This system has an unplanned benefit for snow removal; if the streets were in a normal N–S/E–W grid, only the N–S streets would receive sunlight. With the grid oriented to the diagonal directions, the NW–SE streets receive sunlight to melt <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning and the NE–SW streets receive it in the afternoon. This idea was from Henry Brown the founder of the Brown Palace Hotel. There is now a plaque {{across the street from the}} Brown Palace Hotel which honors this idea. The NW–SE streets are numbered, while the NE–SW streets are named. The named streets start at the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway with the block-long Cheyenne Place. The numbered streets start underneath the Colfax and I-25 viaducts. There are 27 named and 44 numbered streets on this grid. There are also a few vestiges of the old grid system in the normal grid, such as Park Avenue, Morrison Road, and Speer Boulevard. Larimer Street, named after William Larimer, Jr., the founder of Denver, which is in the heart of LoDo, is the oldest street in Denver.|$|E

25|$|Nevada and Arizona {{are both}} {{generally}} arid with desert lands and mountains, and receive {{large amounts of}} <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> higher elevations in and near the mountains. New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado are generally arid, with desert lands and mountains as well. They all receive decent amounts of snow and large amounts of <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high elevations in the mountains, although some areas in far southwestern and southern New Mexico do not receive much snow at all. West Texas is generally arid as well but does not receive {{the same amount of}} snow that the other southwestern states receive at their high elevations. The terrain of western Texas in the Southwest is the flat, rolling land of the plains, which eventually turns into a desert with some hills, and there are significant mountains as well once you reach the Trans-Pecos area.|$|E

25|$|Beavers do not hibernate, but store {{sticks and}} logs {{in a pile}} in their ponds, eating the underbark.

25|$|In {{view of the}} NE-SW {{orientation}} of the river at Born, the community enjoys long periods of sunshine, unlike many of the villages along the Sauer which often lie {{in the shade of}} the hills. Summer temperatures average about 18 C but often reach 30 C and more. Rainfall is moderate. There is sometimes a little <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter. Occasionally the River Sauer floods its banks, with the possibility of flooding in the village itself.|$|E
25|$|The plains {{are also}} {{susceptible}} to occasional floods, which are caused both by thunderstorms {{and by the}} rapid melting of <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains during warm weather. Notable examples include the Big Thompson River flooding of 1976 and the 2013 Colorado floods. Denver's record in 1901 {{for the number of}} consecutive days above 90°F (32°C) was broken during the summer of 2008. The new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record by almost a week.|$|E
25|$|The Tōkaidō Shinkansen often {{experiences}} heavy <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{area around}} Maibara Station in winter. Trains {{have to reduce}} speed, which can disrupt the timetable. Sprinkler systems were later installed, but delays of 10 to 20 minutes still occur during snowy weather. Additionally, treefalls related to excess snow have caused service interruptions. Along {{the route of the}} Jōetsu Shinkansen, winter snow can be very heavy, with snow depths of two to three metres, so the line is equipped with stronger sprinklers and slab track, to mitigate the effects of deep snow.|$|E
