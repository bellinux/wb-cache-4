5|$|In {{addition}} {{to changes in}} the tone of the show, Noah has also implemented stylistic changes to the show, with an updated set, new graphics and his monologue sometimes taking place while <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> screen as opposed to sitting at the desk. Trevor also increased the usage of more millennial based references, impersonations & characterisations for his comedy on the show, due to his younger demographic and his ability to speak in multiple accents and eight languages.|$|E
5|$|Barbara McLaren engaged Lutyens {{to design}} a {{memorial}} for the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which Spalding Urban District Council had purchased in 1897 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Lutyens proposed a U-shaped cloister sheltering a Stone of Remembrance <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> circular lily pool, in the centre {{of which would be}} a cross. McLaren hoped to include space for the families of those commemorated to add their own epitaphs but this proved impractical due to the amount of space that would have been required; she insisted that her husband not receive any special commemoration beyond that afforded to the other casualties.|$|E

5|$|By Your Side was {{released}} on January12, 1999. The album's cover art is a blue-tinted nighttime photograph of the band, all dressed in white and <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lake. The band name is rendered in tiny white lights above their heads, and other small white lights are scattered at their feet. In keeping with the tiny lights theme, {{the back of the}} booklet shows a satellite image of the United States at night, in which densely populated areas can be discerned by light pollution, and the booklet contains drawings of constellations. The album's disc artwork is designed after a centaur with a crow's head in place of the man's head.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} is {{inspired}} by horror films and extensively features gothic and horror related imagery, including references to Michael Jackson's Thriller. The video features references to horror cult films such as American Psycho and Saw {{as well as the}} supposedly haunted painting The Hands Resist Him. The Hand Resists Him is a painting created by artist Bill Stoneham in 1972, depicting a young boy and female doll <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> glass paneled door against which many hands are pressed. The painting became famous for apparently being haunted. The painting is referenced during a scene in the video where West attempts to hold a door closed, from the monsters outside attempting to enter. The video features mostly naked corpse looking models, some of which are decapitated. West's role in the video is similar to Doctor Frankenstein, with the video set in a castle. Jay-Z appears in the video dressed in a tuxedo, <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nude corpse in a darkly-lit library. The video contains two versions of Minaj; a vampire version who is dressed in a gothic inspired outfit (representing her alter ego Roman Zolanski), and a pink-haired version (representing her alter ego Barbie) which the other half tortures during the video. Zombies also appear in the video, with hanging corpses and blood-splattered furniture.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of red nail polish {{dripping}} from a bottle. It then cuts to Buchanan, who is lying and tapping her foot against the floor. She begins to start feeling her body. In the next scene, Range is seen <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mirror with a red lollipop, where she later begins to dance against the sink. Next, all the Sugababes are featured in separate toilet cubicles where they have their hands against the walls. The video cuts to Berrabah walking towards a hand dryer, which she rotates towards her face, causing her hair to be blown. Following this, Range sits on a couch and uses the nail polish to colour her nails. The group is again seen in the cubicles, where they repeatedly open and close the doors. Later, Buchanan, Range and Berrabah are featured in front of red curtains with traditional silver, gold and black outfits, respectively. The final scene shows the group {{in front of the}} cubicles where they begin dancing robotically.|$|E

5|$|Each page of {{the codex}} has been painted on one side with a {{standing}} figure facing left. Each figure holds a weapon and most grip a rope leading to a restrained captive. Colours used on the codex include hematite red, black, blue-green, a red wash and a brown wash, all upon a strong white background. The left-hand side of each page {{is marked by a}} column of day signs; where this column is complete these total thirteen in all. Each day sign is associated with a bar-and-dot numerical coefficient. Six pages depict a figure bearing weapons and accompanied by a captive (pages 1–4, 6 and 9), two pages (5 and 8) both depict a figure hurling a dart at a temple. Page 7 of the codex shows a passive warrior <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tree. Page 11 depicts a death god with a javelin, pointing his weapon at a water vessel containing a snail. Page 10 is a badly damaged fragment with the subject largely obliterated. Based on the surviving portion, Michael Coe thought it depicted a standing figure wearing a waterbird headdress and bearing an atlatl. The figures represented on each page differ from those on the other Maya codices and are far more similar to the Mixtec codices and Toltec art styles of central Mexico. The heads of the death gods painted in the Grolier Codex are almost identical to those represented in the Laud Codex and Fejérváry-Mayer Codex, including the red colouring of the portion of the teeth closest to the gums.|$|E
25|$|Steven Millhauser's {{short story}} The Knife Thrower {{features}} a thrower who specialises in nicking those who {{stand at the}} target board for him, including his female assistant. It was published {{as part of a}} collection that bears the same title. At least one edition features as its cover a painting of a girl <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> target board.|$|E
25|$|After the {{interval}} act is over, {{when all the}} points have been calculated, the presenter(s) of the show call upon each voting country in turn to invite them to announce {{the results of their}} vote. Prior to 1994 the announcements were made over telephone lines; with the audio being piped into the auditorium for the audience to hear, and over the television transmission. However, since and including 1994 the announcements have been presented visually. Often the opportunity is taken by each country to show their spokesperson <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> backdrop which includes a famous place in that country. For example, the French spokesperson might be seen {{standing in front of the}} Eiffel Tower or an Italian presenter might be seen with the Colosseum in the background.|$|E

25|$|In Klazomenai {{primarily}} amphoras and hydria {{were painted}} {{in the middle of}} the 6th century BC (c. 550 to 350 BC), as well as deep bowls with flat, angular-looking figures. The vessels are not very elegant in workmanship. Dancing women and animals were frequently depicted. Leading workshops were those of the Tübingen Painter, the Petrie Painter, and the Urla Group. Most of the vases were found in Naukratis and in Tell Defenneh, which was abandoned in 525 BC. Their origin was initially uncertain, but Robert Zahn identified the source by comparison with images on Klazomenian sarcophagi. The pottery was often decorated with sculptured women’s masks. Mythological scenes were rare; fishscale ornaments, rows of white dots, and stiff-looking dancing women were popular. The depection of a herold <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> king and a queen is unique. In general, men were characterized by large, spade-shaped beards. Starting already in 600 BC and continuing to about 520 BC rosette cups, successor to the eastern Greece bird cups, were produced, probably in Klazomenai.|$|E
25|$|Based on the concept, for the {{majority}} Rouvas represents the dark and erotic side of the video, while Tamta the light and innocence. The video begins {{with the image of}} a man in shadows spinning on a chair and holding his head with his hand. It then forwards to a scene with Tamta, wearing leopard print lingerie, looking in a mirror and getting dressed, continuously alternating between these two scenes, while lights flash constantly. As the first verse begins, the shadowy figure is revealed to be Rouvas, with sweat dripping heavily down his face and an unidentified female hand touching him. A new scene is added with Tamta <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> white background with the wind blowing, wearing various loose, flowy costumes, one of which is a Laskaris Haute Couture creation. The scenes constantly alternate between a single frame to a grid. Throughout the video Tamta wears five different costumes. It was also the first music video where Tamta can be seen with her new look.|$|E
25|$|All six cover sleeves for Japonesque were {{photographed by}} {{photographer}} and designer Kazuyoshi Shimomura. The standalone CD has {{a close-up of}} Koda looking down to the camera, holding a cigarette holder. The CD and DVD format has a long shot of Koda sitting at on a chair with different flowers sitting on the head piece. The three limited edition box set cover sleeves are similar images with different poses; the first box set has Koda <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wall with Japanese design; Koda is holding a traditional Oil-paper umbrella and {{is dressed in a}} pink kimono. The second box set artwork has Koda facing towards the camera, similar to the previous box set. The only change in the third box set artwork is that Koda is seen without holding the umbrella. The digital release uses the first limited edition box set artwork. The booklet and photo shoot were designed by Japanese designer Jun Hirota, and the design was based on traditional Japanese culture and the emphasizing of geisha art. The photo album that came with the second limited edition box set features a 28-page spread, featuring different images from the Japonesque photo shoot.|$|E

500|$|Crawford {{appeared}} in The Unknown (1927), starring Lon Chaney, Sr. {{who played a}} carnival knife thrower with no arms. Crawford played his skimpily-clad young carnival assistant whom he hopes to marry. She stated that she learned more about acting from watching Chaney work than from anyone else in her career. [...] "It was then," [...] she said, [...] "I became aware {{for the first time}} of the difference between <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> camera, and acting."
