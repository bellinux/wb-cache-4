50|$|<b>Saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> are the {{simplest}} of the hydrocarbon species. They are composed entirely of single bonds and are saturated with hydrogen. The formula for acyclic <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (i.e., alkanes) is CnH2n+2. The most general form of <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> is CnH2n+2(1-r), where r {{is the number of}} rings. Those with exactly one ring are the cycloalkanes. <b>Saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> are the basis of petroleum fuels and are found as either linear or branched species. Substitution reaction is their characteristics property (like chlorination reaction to form chloroform). Hydrocarbons with the same molecular formula but different structural formulae are called structural isomers. As given in the example of 3-methylhexane and its higher homologues, branched hydrocarbons can be chiral. Chiral <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> constitute the side chains of biomolecules such as chlorophyll and tocopherol.|$|R

2500|$|In organic chemistry, an alkane, or {{paraffin}} (a historical {{name that}} also has other meanings), is an acyclic <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbon.</b> In other words, an alkane consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms {{arranged in a}} tree structure {{in which all the}} carbon-carbon bonds are single.

30|$|Since the {{question}} of the oil saturation of the Paleocene sediments within the Blagodarnenskaya structure is considered for the first time, it is important to confirm the type of <b>saturating</b> <b>hydrocarbon.</b> Unfortunately, the absence of acoustic and gamma-density tools at the time of logging does not allow to draw a conclusion about the type of <b>saturating</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> by the characteristic separations between the readings of acoustic, neutron- and density-logging instruments.

40|$|The total {{hydrocarbons}} of the millipede Graphidostreptus tumuliporus contain 10 per cent saturated components. The {{composition of the}} <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> from males, females, and eggs is reported. Straight-chain alkanes (n-C 15 –n-C 36) constitute 59 to 75 per cent of the <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> with a strong predominance of odd chain over even chain homologues. Several types of branched-chain alkanes are also present: 2 -methyl (iso), 3 -methyl (anteiso), {{and at least one}} other type of branching. In males and females the most abundant n-alkane is nonacosane (n-C 29) (21 · 67 and 32 · 10 per cent, respectively), whereas in eggs heptacosane (n-C 27) predominates (9 · 90 per cent). The composition of the n-alkanes in males and females resembles the values obtained for plant hydrocarbons, indicating that part of the <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> is probably derived from the food. The low content of n-C 29 in the eggs (7 · 70 per cent) may indicate that the hydrocarbons of the ingested food are not deposited into the egg lipid in equal amounts...|$|R
