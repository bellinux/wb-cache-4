40|$|When PFCs have {{castellated}} structure, co-deposition of fuel inside {{gaps between}} castellated blocks {{is an important}} issue. Four different shapes of castellated tungsten blocks were fabricated to study corresponding issues in KSTAR: Conventional “basic” rectangular shape, <b>single</b> <b>chamfer</b> leading edge, double-chamfer and rounded edge, with two different poloidal gap distances of 0. 5 mm and 1. 0 mm. These tungsten blocks were exposed plasma of L- and H-mode discharges during a whole campaign in 2014. The blocks were taken out from the vacuum vessel after the campaign. Gap deposition was analyzed by Electron Probe X-ray Micro Analyzer (EPMA) to obtain carbon surface density (atoms/cm 2), and by Raman spectroscopy to identify chemical bonding structure of carbon deposits in gaps. The carbon surface density in toroidal and poloidal gaps was in a range from 0. 5 × 1015 atom/cm 2 up to 6. 7 × 1015 atom/cm 2. At the gap entrance, contribution of ions is 6. 0 – 6. 7 × 1015 atom/cm 2, decreased down to 1. 0 × 1015 atom/cm 2 {{at a depth of}} 0. 5 mm, and remains constant afterwards. The contribution of charge exchange neutral is about 3. 0 × 1015 atom/cm 2 at the gap entrance, and then gradually decreases as a function of distance from the entrance. Deposition in 1. 0 mm wide gaps show much larger deposition patterns and that particles have reached much deeper inside the gap. Raman spectra show that the intensity ratio I(D) /I(G) decreases from top to the depth of 5 mm indicating the increase of hydrogen contents...|$|E
50|$|Internally, {{the tower}} {{measures}} 12 ft square. It has {{a ring of}} three bells. Inside the tower there are some remains of Anglo Saxon sculpture. The nave measures 49 ft by 18 ft. It is accessed from the tower through a segmental arch with a <b>single</b> <b>chamfered</b> order. The nave has four bays. The chancel measures 25 ft by 18 ft. It contains an organ chamber and a vestry.|$|R
25|$|The <b>single</b> <b>chamfered</b> bay is {{particularly}} ornate, as it recesses slightly and then curves outward in a baroque fashion. At the ground floor, a wide, segmental arch opening with a hood-mould accesses secondary office space. At the upper level, a rectangular doorway is crowned by an intricate cameo with angel figures {{on either side}} of it. The upper level bay is framed by Tuscan columns which spring from a string-course at the baluster level and support a projection of the building cornice.|$|R
50|$|The precise {{load-out}} {{of tools}} may change {{according to a}} particular job's needs. The CAD stage is also optimised for turret punching: an operation such as rounding a corner may be much quicker with a <b>single</b> <b>chamfered</b> cut than a fully rounded corner requiring several strokes. Changing an unimportant dimension such as {{the width of a}} ventilation slot may match an available tool, requiring a single cut, rather than cutting each side separately. CAD support may also manage the selection of tools to be loaded into the turret before starting work.|$|R
5000|$|The {{church is}} {{constructed}} in red sandstone, with a plinth, chamfered quoins, and other dressings in grey sandstone. The roof is slate. [...] It {{is a simple}} building, long and low. [...] On the west gable is a double bellcote. The church has five bays. On the south front is a single row of windows with round heads and a <b>single</b> <b>chamfered</b> mullion. In the westernmost bay is a door over which is a smaller similar window, but with no mullion. The door has a keystone inscribed with the date 1717, over which is a sandstone sundial with a plaque including the date 1766. The east window {{is similar to the}} windows in the south wall, but with two mullions. The north wall has two tiers of five windows; the lower windows have flat lintels, and the upper row consists of lunette windows.|$|R
50|$|The {{external}} walls of 18 inch thick brick in English bond construction. The building has a hipped roof clad with corrugated iron sheeting. The house is lined {{on three sides}} with wide verandahs on both levels. The verandahs are incorporated under the main roof {{of the building and}} are supported on <b>single</b> stop <b>chamfered</b> timber posts with decorative cast iron brackets and, on the upper floor, cast iron balustrade panels. A valance of lattice marks the first floor level {{on the face of the}} verandah. The front facade of the building is symmetrically arranged and two large timber sash windows flank a central doorway framing double timber doors.|$|R
50|$|The House is a Grade II listed {{building}} made of rock-faced limestone with ashlar dressings and steeply pitched Welsh slate roofs, with decorative ridge tiles. Ashlar coped gables with moulded kneelers and finials. North front entrance has central projecting gabled wing, with single storey, lean to, porch to the left. The doorway has a pointed arched moulded ashlar surround, with marble shafts, and hood mould. Above is a moulded ashlar parapet pierced with quatrofoils. To the right a 2-light chamfered window, with tracery, above a single plain sash, {{in a flat}} headed chamfered surround, with a pointed inner arch. Above again a 3-light, chamfered mullion window, with a taller central light with cusped heads. At the north-west corner a circular or 'candle wick' tower, of 3 storeys, the lower 2 storeys have 3 <b>single</b> light <b>chamfered</b> lancets, with quatrefoil tracery. The building stands in 4 acre of mature grounds with over 40 preserved trees.|$|R
50|$|The west {{verandah}} is {{approached by}} a central set of timber stairs. The corners of the verandah have been enclosed to the north for toilets and to the south for a small kitchen. Both enclosed areas open to the verandah. There are four timber casement windows to {{the west in the}} south corner and three timber casements windows to the west in the north corner. The open middle portion of the verandah has a timber handrail and two horizontal midrails and a <b>single</b> stop <b>chamfered</b> verandah post {{at the top of the}} stair. The west verandah has exposed stud framing and is lined with chamfer boards. There are three sets of triple sash windows to the centre with timber doors to each side and an additional timber door near the north enclosure. There are tilting fanlights above all doors. The panel and sheeted French doors to north of the windows are stop chamfered to the interior. Tusk tenon joints to the framing of the windows and doors.|$|R
5000|$|The limewashed box-framed house, four bays long, {{sits on a}} stone {{platform}} {{built into}} the hillside, under a broad half-hipped roof (now replaced with tiles rather than slates, for which evidence {{was found in the}} archaeological excavations thatch). The principal timbers are tree-ring dated to 1460: dendrochronology has also provided dates of 1594, when a first floor was inserted within the hall, and 1631 when the internal timber-framed smoke-hood was added. [...] The restoration has retained the smoke-hood, but has otherwise restored the three-unit plan of storeyed units {{at either end of the}} open, aisled hall. The two trusses within the hall are a <b>single</b> pair of <b>chamfered</b> wooden speres or posts set in the floor and forming a box-frame which carries the roof, and a pair of arch-braced base-crucks with two tiers of cusped struts above the tie-beam, which spanned the whole width of 7.5 m. The analogies are with the partly aisled halls of important houses in north-east Wales and north-west England. Gable and partition trusses, also aisled. Wind-braces were employed both below the wall-plate and along the purlins ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} {{cohort study}} was to gather the outcomes of zirconia single crowns made by 16 members of the Italian Academy of Prosthetic Dentistry (AIOP) over a time period of up to 5 years. Materials and Methods: A total of 398 patients treated in private practices with 1, 132 zirconia-based single-crown restorations made on natural teeth from January 2005 to July 2010 were included. Three hundred forty-three anterior restorations (30. 3 %) and 789 posterior crowns (69. 7 %) were made with 16 types of zirconia, using primarily chamfer or knife-edge tooth preparation, and examined according to the esthetic, functional, and biologic criteria. To evaluate the relationship of parafunction with mechanical failure, patients with clenching or bruxism were not excluded from the study group. Results: The cumulative survival rate of all restorations was 98. 1 %, while the cumulative success rate was 94. 3 %. Functional criteria had the highest number of failures. The odds ratio (OR) for all restorations was calculated to clarify the relationship between patients who were subject/not subject to parafunctions and technical complications; the OR was 2. 60. An association between parafunction and mechanical failure was found in patients with severe parafunction. Conclusions: Porcelain-veneered zirconia <b>single</b> crowns with <b>chamfer</b> and knife-edge preparations showed good clinical results over a period of up to 5 years. Technical complications were few and were limited primarily to patients with parafunction. © 2013 by Quintessence Publishing Co Inc...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the fracture strength of teeth with different cavosurface margin cavity preparations and restored with composite resin and different adhesive systems. Eighty premolars were randomly divided in 8 groups, as follow: G 1 - sound teeth; G 2 - MOD preparation (no restoration); G 3 - Adper Single Bond without bevel preparation (butt joint); G 4 - Adper Single Bond with bevel preparation; G 5 - Adper <b>Single</b> Bond with <b>chamfer</b> preparation; G 6 - Clearfil SE Bond without bevel (butt joint); G 7 - Clearfil SE Bond with bevel preparation; G 8 - Clearfil SE Bond with chamfer preparation. The adhesive systems were applied according to manufacturers??? instructions. Composite resin (Filtek Z 250) was incrementally placed in all cavities. After 24 h, the specimens were tested in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Data were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey???s test (fracture strength) and Fisher???s exact test (fracture pattern). The confidence level was set at 95 % for all tests. Prepared and nonrestored teeth showed the worst performance and G 4 exhibited the highest fracture strength among all groups (p< 0. 05). In conclusion, all restorative treatments were able to recover the fracture strength of non-restored teeth to levels similar to those of sound teeth.

40|$|O objetivo deste estudo foi determinar, in vitro, a resistência à fratura de pré-molares superiores com diferentes preparos do ângulo cavossuperficial e restaurados com resina composta com distintos sistemas adesivos. Foram selecionados 80 dentes, divididos em 8 grupos: G 1 - hígidos; G 2 - preparos M. O. D.; G 3 - Single Bond sem bisel; G 4 - Single Bond com bisel reto; G 5 - Single Bond com bisel chanfrado; G 6 - Clearfil SE Bond sem bisel; G 7 - Clearfil SE Bond com bisel reto e G 8 - Clearfil SE Bond com bisel chanfrado. Os grupos 3 - 8 foram restaurados com resina composta Z 250, pela técnica incremental. Os corpos-de-prova foram submetidos ao teste de resistência à fratura em máquina {{universal}} de ensaios, a uma velocidade de 0, 5 mm/min. Os dados foram analisados estatisticamente pelos testes ANOVA, Tukey e exato de Fisher (α= 0, 05). O grupo 2 apresentou resistência inferior aos demais e o grupo 4 mostrou-se mais resistente à fratura do que os demais grupos (p< 0, 05). Concluiu-se que o bisel reto foi o preparo mais efetivo quando associado a adesivos dentinários com condicionamento ácido prévio. Ambos adesivos dentinários usados foram capazes de devolver a resistência perdida com o preparo cavitário.
