50|$|Silicon Film, a {{proposed}} digital <b>sensor</b> <b>cartridge</b> for film cameras {{that would allow}} 35 mm cameras to take digital photographs without modification was announced in late 1998. Silicon Film was to work like a roll of 35 mm film, with a 1.3 megapixel sensor behind the lens and a battery and storage unit fitting in the film holder in the camera. The product, which was never released, became increasingly obsolete due to improvements in digital camera technology and affordability. Silicon Films' parent company filed for bankruptcy in 2001.|$|E
50|$|Gillette {{introduced}} the first triple-blade cartridge razor, the Mach3, in 1998, and later upgraded the <b>Sensor</b> <b>cartridge</b> to the Sensor3 {{by adding a}} third blade. Schick/Wilkinson responded to the Mach3 with the Quattro, the first four-blade cartridge razor. These innovations are marketed with the message that they help consumers achieve the best shave as easily as possible. Another impetus {{for the sale of}} multiple-blade cartridges is that they have high profit margins. With manufacturers frequently updating their shaving systems, consumers can become locked into buying their proprietary cartridges, {{for as long as the}} manufacturer continues to make them. Subsequent to introducing the higher-priced Mach3 in 1998, Gillette's blade sales realized a 50% increase, and profits increased in an otherwise mature market.|$|E
30|$|Capillary {{sampling}} procedure {{was based on}} previous experience gathered in preliminary validation studies [12 – 14]. Two operators were trained on the procedures {{of the study and}} performed all evaluations. EL arterialization, aiming at inducing a capillary shunting between arterial and venous territories, was achieved by applying a vasodilation cream (2 % nitro-glycerin cream - Pharmacy Department, Corporació Sanitària Parc Taulí. Spain). Arterialization was initially performed during two and a half minutes for the first 20 patients, but was later increased to five minutes for the remaining 35 patients of the study. Reasons for increasing arterialization time were based on the results from the first interim analysis in which high sampling failure was observed. Increasing arterialization time aimed at increasing capillary blood flow at the earlobe in an attempt to improve sampling success rate. Following arterialization, a dedicated collection system (Earlobe Arterialized Blood Collector - EABC®; Microgravity Center/FENG-PUCRS, Porto Alegre, Brazil) was used for collection. Designed as a sterilized, self-contained, small, portable device, the EABC® system allowed anaerobic blood sampling by minimally trained personnel with reduced discomfort to the subject. The EABC® system consists of a plastic shell containing a small blade, a heparinized capillary tube and a <b>sensor</b> <b>cartridge.</b> After proper fixation to the EL, the <b>sensor</b> <b>cartridge</b> receives arterialized blood directly from a small cut in the skin through the capillary tube. Blood was procured from a specific region of the earlobe in a consistent fashion. The <b>sensor</b> <b>cartridge</b> and the capillary tube are visible so that the operator can monitor blood passage as it enters the cartridge until a predefined mark. Samples were analyzed using CG 4 + gasometrical cartridges and the i-STAT® portable analyzer (Abbot, Abbott Park, IL, USA) [15]. Once patients were included into the study, one blood sample was collected per patient. Inability to obtain a valid blood sample after four collection attempts was considered a sampling failure. Simultaneously, an arterial blood sample was collected from the arterial line and analyzed by the ABL 700 ® blood gas analyzer (Radiometer, Brønshøj, Denmark) [16]. This system was considered the reference method of measure for this study. Both the i-STAT® and the ABL 700 ® were calibrated, maintained and updated periodically as indicated by the manufacturer.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSU- 8 and {{polydimethylsiloxane}} (PDMS) {{are both}} transparent materials with properties very convenient for rapid prototyping of microfluidic systems. However, previous efforts of combining these two materials failed due to poor adhesion between them. Herein, we introduce a promising low-temperature technique (< 100 °C) to irreversibly bond {{two or more}} structured layers of SU- 8 and PDMS to create hybrid stacks. This offers new possibilities in design and fabrication of enclosed three-dimensional microstructures and microchannels with simple soft-lithography techniques.

30|$|Stress {{tests were}} {{completed}} using the Seahorse Bioscience XFe 96 Flux analyzer {{according to the}} manufacturer’s instructions to measure oxygen consumption (mitochondrial stress test) and extracellular acidification (glycolysis stress test). The reagents used for the mitochondrial stress tests were optimized for maximal effect for ASCs isolated from each peri-organ region, and all chemicals were obtained from Seahorse Biosciences or Sigma Aldrich. Cells from passages 3 – 9 were seeded into 96 -well plates at their previously optimized density of 40, 000 cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight. Prior to running the mitochondrial or glycolysis stress assays, cells were first washed with assay media containing 3  mM l-glutamine, 1  mM pyruvate and 8  mM glucose, and incubated at 37  °C in a non-CO 2 environment 60  min prior to the Seahorse assay {{in order to allow}} the cells to become equilibrated with the assay medium. The XFe 96 <b>sensor</b> <b>cartridge</b> was pre-hydrated with calibrant solution overnight at room temperature prior to the experimental assay.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method for {{measuring}} blood plasma and serum viscosity with a microcantilever-based MEMS sensor. MEMS cantilevers {{are made of}} electroplated nickel and actuated remotely with magnetic field using an electro-coil. Real-time monitoring of cantilever resonant frequency is performed remotely using diffraction gratings fabricated {{at the tip of}} the dynamic cantilevers. Only few nanometer cantilever deflection is sufficient due to interferometric sensitivity of the readout. The resonant frequency of the cantilever is tracked with a phase lock loop (PLL) control circuit. The viscosities of liquid samples are obtained through the measurement of the cantilever's frequency change with respect to a reference measurement taken within a liquid of known viscosity. We performed measurements with glycerol solutions at different temperatures and validated the repeatability of the system by comparing with a reference commercial viscometer. Experimental results are compared with the theoretical predictions based on Sader's theory and agreed reasonably well. Afterwards viscosities of different Fetal Bovine Serum and Bovine Serum Albumin mixtures are measured both at 23. °C and 37. °C, body temperature. Finally the viscosities of human blood plasma samples taken from healthy donors are measured. The proposed method is capable of measuring viscosities from 0. 86. cP to 3. 02. cP, which covers human blood plasma viscosity range, with a resolution better than 0. 04. cP. The sample volume requirement is less than 150. μl and can be reduced significantly with optimized cartridge design. Both the actuation and sensing are carried out remotely, which allows for disposable <b>sensor</b> <b>cartridges.</b> © 2013...|$|R

40|$|We propose and {{demonstrate}} a novel one step method to integrate gold coated <b>sensors</b> with <b>cartridges</b> by dry covalent bonding. The cartridges are replica molded in an UV-curable off-stoichiometry thiol-ene (OSTE) polymer, featuring {{an excess of}} thiol functional groups that covalently bond {{to the surface of}} gold coated sensors upon contact. The method is demonstrated by the integration of a gold coated quartz crystal to a microfludic OSTE cartridge. The resulting bond interface is shown to be completely homogenous and void free and the package is tested successfully to a differential pressure of up to 2 bars. The performance of the biosensor chip is evaluated by measuring the unspecific binding of 0. 5 % albumin, resulting in a total frequency drop 205 Hz. This approach delivers a simple but rapid high quality integration aiming for the production of robust, low cost and disposable biosensor chips QC 20111129 RPARappi...|$|R

40|$|The "Komplast" {{experiment}} {{has been}} carried out on the ISS by the Khrunichev Space Center jointly with other Russian scientific centers since 1998. The experiment incorporates the "Komplast" cartridges on the FGB exterior, which are fitted with materials specimens and <b>sensors.</b> The <b>cartridges</b> were sent into orbit together with FGB on 20 November 1998. In March 2011, two of the cartridges were taken back from the ISS by the "Discovery" American space shuttle after being exposed in the open space for 12 years. In the framework of this experiment the subject of analysis is the effect of the space environment on the exposed specimens of various materials. This report covers the analysis results of the surface morphology of various materials taken from the "Komplast" cartridges exposed to hits of micrometeors and micronic particles of space debris. Analysis is made of microcraters of 5 to 250 mcm in specimens of polished metals and silicone comprised in the sensor for micrometeoric particles. The report represents optic and scanning electron microscope images of craters formed in the specimens by high-velocity and low-velocity particles impacting the surface. By virtue of the electronic microscope, data on composition of the substance in the craters and of the substance of the low-velocity particles are obtained. The data make it possible to differentiate the particles as the natural-origin particles or anthropogenic-origin space debris particles. Distribution of craters and low-velocity particles in the size range of 5 to 50 mcm is obtained. The data are compared with the existing models of fluxes of natural-origin and artificial-origin microparticles on the ISS orbit. Inhomogeneous particles of complicated configuration are discovered {{on the surface of the}} analyzed specimens, whose origin are not uniquely determined and are to be the subject of further study...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this article}} was to {{evaluate}} the accuracy and reliability of the AG 500 (Carstens Medizinelectronik, Lenglern, Germany), an electromagnetic device developed recently to register articulatory movements in three dimensions. This technology seems to have unprecedented capabilities to provide rich information about time-varying positions of articulators. However, strengths and weaknesses of the system need to be better understood before the device is used for speech research. Method: Evaluations of the sensor positions over time were obtained during (a) movements of the calibration device, (b) manual movements of <b>sensors</b> in a <b>cartridge</b> within the recording field of the cube, and (c) various speech tasks. Results: Results showed a median error to be under 0. 5 mm across different types of recordings. The maximum error often ranged between 1 and 2 mm. The magnitude of error depended somewhat on the task but largely on the location of the sensors within the recording region of the cube. Conclusion: The performance of the system was judged as adequate for speech movement acquisition, provided that specific steps are taken for minimizing error during recording and for validating the quality of recorded data...|$|R
40|$|An ampoule failure {{system for}} use in {{material}} processing furnaces comprising a containment cartridge and an ampoule failure <b>sensor.</b> The containment <b>cartridge</b> contains an ampoule of toxic material therein and is positioned within a furnace for processing. An ampoule failure probe is positioned in the containment cartridge adjacent the ampoule for detecting a potential harmful release of toxic material therefrom during processing. The failure probe is spaced a predetermined distance from the ampoule and is chemically chosen so as to undergo a timely chemical reaction with the toxic material upon the harmful release thereof. The ampoule failure system further comprises a data acquisition system which is positioned externally of the furnace and is electrically connected to the ampoule failure probe so as to form a communicating electrical circuit. The data acquisition system includes an automatic shutdown device for shutting down the furnace upon the harmful release of toxic material. It also includes a resistance measuring device for measuring {{the resistance of the}} failure probe during processing.

40|$|It is {{believed}} Lab-on-Chip systems {{will become a}} mainstream technology within the next centuries. Especially because of new findings in molecular medicine and global trends such as the changing global population {{in third world countries}} and an ageing population in industrial countries, the need for fast and reliable diagnostics is rising tremendously. Hence, diagnostics have to become more frequently and more easily available. In this regard, technologies have to be found that enable the cost-effective production and hence an affordable price. In a joint-project between seven Fraunhofer institutes a Lab-on-Chip system was developed which consists of a credit-card-sized cartridge and a base station. The cartridges contain besides the reagents necessary for a specific assay also functionalities such as pumping or heating enabling a self-contained system without any fluidic interfaces, which tend to be error-prone. Because of the modularity of the system it is possible to integrate an optical sensor as well an electrochemical <b>sensor</b> into the <b>cartridge.</b> Hence, the system can be customized to serve the needs of the particular assays. This chapter will describe the system including generic design rules for such Lab-on-Chip systems, the development of these rules into a modular Lab-on-Chip system, the integration of biomedical assays, and the production possibility of this system...|$|R
