5|$|As dawn broke next morning, 15 May 1943, a torpedo hit Irish Oak at 8:19am (12:19 German Summer Time). Two torpedoes were launched, one missed, {{the other}} <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> port side and exploded.|$|E
5|$|During the 1910 gunnery {{training}} exercises, Patrie suffered mechanical {{problems with}} her sighting equipment that disabled {{one of her}} main battery turrets. In 1910 the battleship again was in an accident; while on maneuvers in the Gulf of Jouan, Patrie launched a torpedo that inadvertently <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> sister République. Her hull was damaged, and {{she was forced to}} put into Toulon for repairs.|$|E
5|$|Under heavy {{anti-aircraft}} fire, {{they dropped}} their bombs. Although their crews reported hitting 4 ships, {{none of the}} bombs actually hit anything and no significant damage was inflicted. Early the following morning, the Japanese oil tanker Akebono Maru sustained the first hit when a torpedo from an attacking PBY <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> around 01:00. This was the only successful air-launched torpedo attack by the U.S. during the entire battle.|$|E

5|$|Another {{surviving}} {{victim was}} customer Jeff Schaffart, 34, who was treated and released at UNMC for {{a gunshot wound}} to the left arm and the little finger of his left hand. The Omaha Police Department announced on December 22, 2007, that Mandy Hyda, 34, received a bruise when a bullet fragment <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> left leg. She was neither transported nor treated for the injury. It was initially reported that there were five people injured (not including Hyda), but two of those at the scene who were sent to local hospitals were sent {{for reasons other than}} being shot by Hawkins.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Goeppert Mayer was {{appointed}} full {{professor of physics}} at the University of California, San Diego. Although she suffered from a stroke shortly after arriving there, she continued to teach and conduct research for a number of years. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965. Goeppert Mayer died in San Diego, California, on February 20, 1972, after a heart attack that had <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> the previous year left her comatose. She was buried at El Camino Memorial Park in San Diego.|$|E
5|$|In Christianity, Saint Apollonia is {{the patron}} saint of {{toothache}} and other dental problems. She was an early Christian martyr who was persecuted for her beliefs in Alexandria during the Imperial Roman age. A mob <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> repeatedly in the face until all her teeth were smashed. She was threatened with being burned alive unless she renounced Christianity, but she instead chose to throw herself onto the fire. Supposedly, toothache sufferers who invoke her name will find relief.|$|E

5|$|McLeod's {{most notable}} and {{controversial}} appearance {{came during the}} 2012 Summer Olympics in London. In the semi-final match against the United States on August 6, the referee ruled that McLeod had broken the six-second handling rule in the 76th minute, when Canada was leading 3–2. A free kick {{was given to the}} United States which resulted in a penalty being called on Canadian player Marie-Ève Nault after the ball <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> in the arm. The United States was given a penalty kick, which McLeod did not save. The United States ultimately won the game in overtime, eliminating Canada's chance for the gold medal.|$|E
5|$|The USS Constellation vs La Vengeance, or the Action of 1 February 1800, was a single-ship action fought between frigates of the French Navy and the United States Navy {{during the}} Quasi-War. In the battle the American frigate USS Constellation {{tried to take}} the French frigate La Vengeance as a prize. Both ships got heavily damaged. Although the French frigate <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> colors twice, she managed to flee after the main mast of her {{opponent}} had fallen.|$|E
5|$|U-9, {{commanded}} by Kapitänleutnant Otto Weddigen, {{had been ordered}} to attack British transports at Ostend, but {{had been forced to}} dive and take shelter from the storm. On surfacing, she spotted the British ships and moved to attack. She fired one torpedo at 06:20 at Aboukir which <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> on the starboard side; the ship's captain thought he had struck a mine and ordered the other two ships to close to transfer his wounded men. Aboukir quickly began listing and capsized around 06:55 despite counterflooding compartments on the opposite side to right her.|$|E

5|$|For a {{while it}} seemed that Franklin would also be burnt, but her crew were able {{to put out the}} fires. With Brueys killed aboard Orient, Du Chayla now became commander. Both he and Captain Gillet had been seriously wounded and taken below, but he {{continued}} to order the attack. The brief quiet that had resulted from the explosion of the Orient was broken by Franklins guns, and the battle resumed. She fought for another hour, but by then she had lost her main and mizzenmasts, nearly all of her cannons had been knocked out, and over half her crew were dead or wounded. She finally <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> colours.|$|E
5|$|On 24 December Brilliant and Coventry {{encountered}} {{their second}} privateer, the 24-gun Le Dragon. There {{was a brief}} exchange of fire in which four French sailors were killed and up to 12 wounded, against six wounded men aboard Coventry. After the outgunned French vessel <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> colours the British took her surviving 280 crew prisoner. On the following day a third French ship hove into view, the Intrepid, a 14-gun snow-rigged privateer. After a short chase she fell within range of Brilliants guns; the French fired first, wounding one British sailor. The responding broadside from Brilliant capsized Intrepid and killed ten men among her crew of 120. The survivors were taken prisoner aboard Brilliant and handed over to British authorities at Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|Bismarck then shifted fire to Prince of Wales. The British {{battleship}} {{scored a}} hit on Bismarck with her sixth salvo, but the German ship found her mark with her first salvo. One of the shells struck the bridge on Prince of Wales, though it did not explode and instead exited the other side, killing everyone in the ship's command centre, save Captain John Leach, the ship's commanding officer, and one other. The two German ships continued to fire upon Prince of Wales, causing serious damage. Guns malfunctioned on the recently commissioned British ship, which still had civilian technicians aboard. Despite the technical faults in the main battery, Prince of Wales scored three hits on Bismarck in the engagement. The first <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> in the forecastle above the waterline but low enough to allow the crashing waves to enter the hull. The second shell struck below the armoured belt and exploded on contact with the torpedo bulkhead completely flooding a turbo-generator room and partially flooding an adjacent boiler room. The third shell passed {{through one of the}} boats carried aboard the ship and then went through the floatplane catapult without exploding.|$|E

5|$|In June 1943, {{a series}} of Allied air raids {{attacked}} La Spezia {{in an attempt to}} neutralize the three battleships. On 5 June, she was hit by two large bombs that <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> port side. She was transferred to Genoa for repairs, which were not completed before the Armistice that ended Italian participation in the war. Littorio was hit by three bombs on 19 June, a week after her sister was damaged. She was renamed Italia after Benito Mussolini's regime collapsed. Roma was damaged during the 5 June attack and again in a third attack on 23 June. In September 1943, following the withdrawal of Italy from the war, all three ships and {{a significant portion of the}} Italian fleet left port to be interned in Malta. While en route, German bombers laden with Fritz-X radio-guided bombs attacked the formation. One hit Italia in the bow forward the main battery turrets, causing serious damage. Two hit Roma; one passed through the ship and exploded under her keel, and the second hit near the forward magazines. The bomb detonated the magazines, causing a massive explosion that destroyed the ship with heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|Lützows forward gun turret {{was hit by}} one of the 15cm rounds, which {{disabled}} {{the center}} gun and damaged the right barrel. Four men were wounded. A second shell struck the ship's deck and penetrated the upper and main armored decks; starting a fire in the cruiser's hospital and operating theater, killing two soldiers and severely wounding six others. A third <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> superstructure behind the port-side aircraft crane. One of the aircraft on board was damaged, and four gunners were killed by the third shell. The ship was only able to fire her secondary battery in return. The heavy damage forced Lützow {{and the rest of the}} squadron to reverse course and exit the fjord. She eventually landed her troop complement in Verle Bay, after which she used her operational 28cm guns to provide fire support. By the afternoon of 9 April, most of the Norwegian fortresses had been captured and the commander of the remaining Norwegian forces opened negotiations for surrender. The delay had, however, allowed enough time for the Norwegian government and royal family to flee Oslo.|$|E
5|$|Repairs to Vittorio Veneto were {{completed}} {{in time for}} her to join Littorio on attacks on the convoys Vigorous and Harpoon, which had departed Alexandria and Gibraltar to reinforce Malta simultaneously in mid-June. Combat was limited to the opposing light forces, and Littorio and Vittorio Veneto did not see action; the British nevertheless broke off Operation Vigorous due to the ships' presence and heavy air attacks. While returning to port, Littorio was hit by a bomb from an American B-24 Liberator heavy bomber; the bomb struck the forward gun turret, though it did minimal damage. Before returning to port, a British Wellington bomber torpedoed the ship. The torpedo <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> starboard bow, though she returned to port. Repairs {{were completed}} and on 12 December, both ships were moved from Taranto to La Spezia in response to the Allied landings in North Africa. Roma joined the fleet shortly after the attacks on the two convoys, and joined her sisters for the move to La Spezia. There, she replaced Littorio as the fleet flagship.|$|E

5|$|Seeing Arnaud felled by gunfire, Magruder, who {{was wearing}} body armor, stepped back and drew her sidearm. However, before she could return fire, Logan then shot six bullets at her, one of which <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> in the head, mortally {{wounding}} her. Logan then went over to Arnaud and, while standing over his body, shot him four more times, injuring his liver and inducing severe internal bleeding. Arnaud would die from severe gunshot-induced blood loss at the scene, but the mortally wounded Magruder was able to call for assistance over her radio at 9:34p.m. Logan's father, {{who was in the}} house's master bedroom, had heard the gunshots, and thinking that the deputies had shot him, went over to see what had happened. Instead, he saw Logan leaving the house with a firearm in hand, and saw that the two deputies had been shot. Logan's father then called 9-1-1 via telephone at 9:39p.m. to report the shooting to authorities. Emergency medical technicians arrived and removed Arnaud and Magruder were removed from the house via stretchers, with Magruder being airlifted via medical helicopter to the Prince George's Hospital Center, with CPR being applied on her while en route. However, she would be pronounced dead at the hospital before midnight.|$|E
5|$|Severely damaged, Tripoli <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> {{colors to}} {{indicate}} surrender. As Enterprise moved towards the vessel to accept its surrender, the Tripolitans hoisted their flag and fired upon Enterprise. The Tripolitans again attempted {{to board the}} American schooner, but were repelled by Enterprise broadsides and musketry. After another exchange of fire, the Tripolitans struck their colors a second time. Sterett once more ceased firing and moved closer to Tripoli. In response, Rous again raised his colors and attempted to board Enterprise. Enterprise accurate gunnery once more forced Tripoli to veer off. As the action continued, Rous perfidiously feigned a third surrender {{in an attempt to}} draw the American schooner within grappling range. This time, Sterett kept his distance, and ordered Enterprise guns to be lowered to aim at the polacca's waterline, a tactic that threatened to sink the enemy ship. The next American broadsides struck their target, causing massive damage, dismasting her mizzen-mast, and reducing her to a sinking condition. With most of his crew dead or wounded, the injured Admiral Rous finally threw the Tripolitan flag into the sea to convince Sterett to end the action.|$|E
5|$|U-9, {{commanded}} by Kapitänleutnant Otto Weddigen, {{had been ordered}} to attack British transports at Ostend, but {{had been forced to}} dive and take shelter from the storm. On surfacing, she spotted the British ships and moved to attack. She fired one torpedo at 06:20 at Aboukir that <b>struck</b> <b>her</b> on the starboard side; the ship's captain thought he had struck a mine and ordered the other two ships to close to transfer his wounded men. Aboukir quickly began listing and capsized around 06:55. As Hogue approached her sinking sister, Captain Wilmot Nicholson realized that it had been a submarine attack and signalled Cressy to look for a periscope although his ship continued to close on Aboukir as her crew threw overboard anything that would float to aid the survivors in the water. Having stopped and lowered all her boats, Hogue was struck by two torpedoes around 06:55. The sudden weight loss of the two torpedoes caused U-9 to broach the surface and Hogues gunners opened fire without effect before the submarine could submerge again. The cruiser capsized about ten minutes after being torpedoed as all of her watertight doors had been open and sank at 07:15.|$|E
