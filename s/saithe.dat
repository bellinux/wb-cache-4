Excavations in the 1930s by Alex Curle found the first confirmed Norse longhouse in the British Isles and later digs in the 1950s found evidence of fishing and farming activities. Sheep, cattle, pigs and ponies were kept, Atlantic cod, <b>saithe</b> and ling were eaten, and whale and seal bones have also been found along with {{the remains of a}} single dog.

25|$|Copepods {{and other}} {{zooplankton}} are plentiful in the North Sea. These tiny organisms are crucial {{elements of the}} food chain supporting many species of fish. Over 230 species of fish live in the North Sea. Cod, haddock, whiting, <b>saithe,</b> plaice, sole, mackerel, herring, pouting, sprat, and sandeel are all very common and are fished commercially. Due to the various depths of the North Sea trenches and differences in salinity, temperature, and water movement, some fish such as blue-mouth redfish and rabbitfish reside only in small areas of the North Sea.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 September 1972, Iceland again {{expanded}} her maritime exclusive economic zone, {{this time}} to [...] This provoked another dispute, eventually escalating to further armed conflict between the UK and Iceland. Iceland's expansion was recognised by fishermen from all nations except two: the UK, and Germany, who still fished up to [...] from the Icelandic coast. German trawlers, however, {{tended to be more}} interested in <b>saithe</b> and ocean perch rather than cod, haddock and flatfish; because of this, they tended to stick to oceanic, rather than coastal waters. As the dispute escalated, British trawler captains began to cover their names and registration numbers to avoid action from Icelandic courts; as an additional, and somewhat less effective measure some hoisted the Jolly Roger in addition to the Union Jack. The Icelandic Coastguard viewed this as a violation of international law, and took many photographs of the trawlers displaying these signs; including a picture taken on 5 September 1972 of a ship believed to be the trawler Peter Scott (H103). The Icelandic strategy involved the use of net-cutters, invented by Commander Péter Sigurǒsson, Director of the Coast Guard, with assistance from Friŏrik Teitsson from the Icelandic lighthouse institution and Tómas Sigurǒsson, who were both ironmongers. The invention—tested in 1958—was known as the trawlwire cutter; it was not used until 5 September 1972, after every Icelandic ship had been equipped with it. The ships would take a two-step approach: ...|$|E

5000|$|In the winter, the codfish {{comes to}} the coastal waters to spawn, {{especially}} to the cod fisheries of Lofoten. Mølja, boiled codfish with liver and roe, is a delicacy that today is served in the best restaurants. In the summer, the coalfish, or <b>saithe,</b> bites, and fresh <b>saithe</b> is often served on the beach, boiled in seawater over an open fire, or fried (typically the smaller coalfish). Halibut is traditional Christmas food. Most fish is served plainly poached, only accompanied by boiled potatoes, carrots and possibly fried bacon. A more particular kind of fish is [...] "gammelsei", <b>saithe</b> that has been conserved {{for a year or}} more. Other traditions are lutefisk and boknafisk, the latter made from stockfish, and in Nordland often from herring. Seawolf and rose fish are regarded as good food, the latter often eaten salted and poached, with the brain (krus) highly regarded, sometimes fried with onions. In addition to cod, herring and potatoes were traditional staple foods (except in the most northern area). Salmon has long traditions as food along the rivers, and also trout which are common also in the numerous lakes. In the latest decades consumption has increased in correspondence with increased salmon fish farming; smoked salmon is very popular, often on open sandwiches, alone or together with boiled or scrambled eggs or salad.|$|E

Laugafiskur has an annual production of 7,500 tonnes of raw material. Its products are mostly cod, but haddock and <b>saithe</b> are also a substantial part. The main products are fish heads, bones and cutlets. Laugafiskur exports mainly to Nigeria, where dried fish is popular.|$|E
50|$|In the sea many larger {{fish species}} prey on the Raitt’s sand eel {{including}} cod, haddock, whiting, <b>saithe</b> and mackerel. Many {{of these are}} very commercially valuable species and declines in sand eel have caused declines in their numbers {{due to lack of}} prey. Marine mammals also feed on Raitt’s sand eels but less regularly. Mostly species such as grey seals, harbour seals and harbour porpoise consume lots of sand eels in the Spring and early Summer.|$|E

50|$|In {{demersal}} fishery, {{the species}} fishes caught are white fish (cod, hake, haddock, whiting, <b>saithe),</b> flatfish (sole, plaice, flounder and so forth), lobster and deep water prawns. One feature which needs consolidation is the uniting of small fishing operators of Denmark into one viable major sector, as at present the Norwegians have held this position. As the Danish industrial and cod fisheries role {{is a major}} factor in the North Sea, the resource position of a few species is not definite.|$|E

In 2013 HB Grandi’s five freezer trawlers caught a total of 33.500 tons.|$|E
5000|$|The fishery {{has always}} been for both {{whitefish}} and herring. The Norsemen came to Scotland from the 9th to 11th centuries and settled in the Northern Isles, Western Isles and on the mainland. They had fish as {{a large part of}} their diet, and excavations of Viking sites in Orkney and Shetland have found middens (kitchen waste areas) containing large quantities of fish bones. These bones were mainly of cod, <b>saithe</b> and ling but herring, haddock and whiting bones were also found. They used the line fishing method with hooks and bait.|$|E
5000|$|Lofoten Viking AS - {{is owned}} 52.3% by Nergård AS. Another 22.3% {{is owned by}} Arne Mathisen, 22.3% is owned by Lorentz Hardy and 3.2% owned by Jens-Petter Gylseth. The company has {{factories}} both for pelagic fish and whitefish. Frozen products and different fish fillets is produced from pelagic fish - herring, capelin, and mackerel. Stockfish is produced by cod, haddock and <b>saithe,</b> and {{a small amount of}} fresh fish sold, too. The company is also one on the world's largest exporters of Stockfish to the Italian market.|$|E
50|$|Both Oronsay and {{neighbouring}} Colonsay have furnished archaeologists with invaluable {{information about}} the Mesolithic period of prehistory, particularly about the diet of human beings. Three middens on Oronsay were opened in the 1880s and have provided a piece of bone carbon-dated to 4600 BC and an oyster shell to 3065 BC. Evidence provided from <b>saithe</b> bones in the middens suggest that the local population lived there all year round and were heavily reliant on marine protein. Site datings on Colonsay and Islay suggest an absence of human habitation in the area from c.5250-4750 BC for unknown reasons.|$|E

50|$|Salmon, {{sea trout}} and sea char {{are found in}} the rivers {{throughout}} the area, especially the Rauma, Driva, and Eira, already legendary among the British gentry in the mid-19th century. Trout is abundant in most lakes. Cod, pollock, <b>saithe,</b> mackerel and other species of saltwater fish are commonly caught in the Romsdalsfjord, both from land and from boat. Skiing is a popular activity among the inhabitants of Molde in the winter, on groomed tracks, in resorts or by own trail. There are several popular rock climbing, ice climbing, bouldering, glacier and basejumping areas in the immediate surroundings of Molde.|$|E
5000|$|The large {{elliptical}} tank in {{the centre}} of the museum's old building measures 22 by 33 m and holds 4500000 L of water. The centre tank was designed to resemble the open sea in the North Sea, and specially to hold schooling, pelagic fish. It is also a [...] "show-room" [...] for displaying large specimens of some of the species which are also seen in the habitat tanks - for example cod, <b>saithe,</b> turbot and sea-bass. Other large species in the tank are spiny dogfish, skates, and ocean sunfish. In total, there are about 2-3000 fish in this tank.|$|E
5000|$|Pollock (alternatively {{and more}} {{commonly}} among anglers spelled pollack; pronounced [...] ) {{is the common}} name used for {{either of the two}} species of North Atlantic marine fish in the genus Pollachius. Pollachius pollachius is referred to as pollock in both North America and the United Kingdom, while Pollachius virens today is usually known as coley in the British Isles (derived from the older name coalfish). Other names for P. pollachius include the Atlantic pollock, European pollock, lieu jaune, and lythe; while P. virens is also known as Boston blue (distinct from bluefish), silver bill, or <b>saithe.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, {{the dietary}} {{behaviour}} of whales differ among species {{as well as}} season, location and availability of prey. For example, sperm whales' prey primarily consists of mesopelagic squid. However, in Iceland, they are reported to consume mainly fish. In addition to krill, minke whales are known to eat {{a wide range of}} fish species including capelin, herring, sand lance, mackerel, gadoids, cod, <b>saithe</b> and haddock. Minke whales are estimated to consume 633,000 tons of Atlantic herring per year in part of Northeast Atlantic. In the Barents Sea, it is estimated that a potential net economic loss of five tons of cod and herring per fishery results from every additional minke whale in the population due the fish consumption of the single whale.|$|E
