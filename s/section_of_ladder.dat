These butchered remains of trolleys and frames; welded and reconfigured relics assert {{their presence in the}} space from afar, the viewers eye piecing together the utilitarian frag- ments, a <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>ladder</b> or a slice of girder, caricatures of their former selves. The eye is drawn in toward a surface; which has been drilled, slashed, hacked and sawn, hu- man hands have chopped chunks off. The cast as a replica, a copy housing the identity of the original has been further destroyed. And on closer scrutiny these surfaces are inhabited by little manufactured people going about their ascribed business, these sculptures morph into landscapes, asking to be scrutinised in ever more depth for meaning. The pressure between abstraction and figuration is present within this cyclical drama. Abstraction an oppositional force of dreams and illusions which on the one hand offers the unadorned fact of the physicality of material and surface, {{yet at the same time}} performs that act of making ‘a space apart from life’, which in turn is re-populated by figures such as sunbather’s, perhaps passing the time unperturbed by this chain of events. The phenomena of the eye being drawn in to both delight and question the role of detail and surface continues in Dawson’s new paintings, these have an utter simplicity to them, a dot made up from lots of other dots. These paintings appear both randomized yet sequenced, with the viewer left wondering what form of optical illusion is at work as the eye attempts to discern an image. Miru Miru Mega Yokunaru (your eyesight gets {{better and better}} in a short rate of time), was the first publication of the magic eye pictures that briefly became all the rage in the 1990 ’s, those abstract all over patterns that would reveal a floating image (of a dinosaur or hemp plant for example) providing you had the determination to force your eyes out of focus with the pattern. Seeing one thing and then another thing within it, termed ‘(a) spect dawning’ by Wittgen- stein, raises apprehensions, of something that did not appear to be there before and it is per- haps the apprehension of this hiddenness that these works evoke. ?The brightly coloured dots of Dawson’s paintings coalesce sometimes clustering, forming cre- ating a pictorial relationship to cosmological constellations, of galaxies and star formations. Searching for a pattern within these dots, the viewer is perhaps reminded of the awe-inspiring moment of staring at the night sky, and perhaps what a distant memory this is. What would have carried meaning for tens of thousands of years is now a humbling yet detached experi- ence. By presenting both sets of works together for the first time, Dawson is posing intriguing questions, the viewers eyes are triangulated like a geographer between two different illusory bonds that of the flat terrain of the paintings and the occupied undulations of the sculptures. Miru Miru Mega Yokunaru, indeed, perhaps your eyesight will get better in a short rate of time. <br/...|$|E

40|$|During the 1960 s, as more dams {{went into}} full {{operation}} on the Columbia River, {{it was discovered}} that the passage of American shad Alosa sapidissima was restricted or completely blocked through the regulating <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> the fish <b>ladders.</b> To study the problem, a full-scale laboratory model of six pools <b>of</b> the regulating <b>section</b> <b>of</b> the fish <b>ladders</b> at John Day Dam was built. American shad, chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, sockeye salmon O. nerka, and steelhead O. mykiss (formerly Salmo gairdneri) were counted and timed through various weir designs at different heads. American shad oriented toward surface flows, tending to reject submerged orifices as shallow as 2 m. The amount of time spent in the ladder by American shad depended on the head between pools. The species of salmonids tested were not significantly impeded by any of the weir designs or head differentials. The results of these studies were used to develop new design criteria for the regulating <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> fish <b>ladders.</b> These criteria have been used in modifications of existing structures and in the design of new facilities...|$|R

The ladder has 25 steps (tanks), 78. 3 m long and 10. 8 m high. Over 41 species {{were captured}} in the region of the Salto do Morais dam, at least 34 of which were present in the ladder. However, there were few individuals of each species and only 2 % of them reached the upper <b>section</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ladder.</b> This suggests that the ladder is selective for certain species, the most affected being the Pimelodidae family...|$|R

The angry Coyote uses his own broken ladder to climb up to the top, with predictably disastrous results.

This number, particularly in case of interleaved windings, is woefully small rendering the entire exercise pointless. An attempt is described wherein this physical resolution can be enhanced. This is achieved by augmenting the measured driving-point admittance data (of the interleaved winding) with information regarding natural frequencies that are observable, and hence extractable, from an additional measurement of the open-circuited neutral-end voltage spectrum. By this process, a few more additional natural frequencies become available for processing, resulting in a ladder network with an increased physical resolution, i. e., more number <b>of</b> <b>sections.</b> Measurements done on an actual interleaved winding are presented to demonstrate feasibility of the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|Modifications of {{the flow}} control {{sections}} and counting stations of the Bradford Island and Washington Shore fish ladders at Bonneville Dam were necessary to accommodate rapid pool changes which will result from fluctuating discharges caused by power peaking at hydroelectric projects upstream. Fishway operation for the extreme flood control pool range from elev 70. 0 to elev 82. 5 (feet above mean sea level) was considered. The normal range for design was between elev 72. 0 and 80. 0. A portion of the forebay, the exit control section, the counting station, the supply channel for auxiliary water, and typical <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> each <b>ladder</b> were studied in a 1 : 14 -scale model. Hydraulically satisfactory designs for automatic control systems with vertical-slot nonoverflow walls, bleed-off and add-in diffusers, auxiliary water supply, and moveable-board underwater counting station and for revised overflow weirs downstream were developed in the model. The designs for both ladders were operative with forebay levels between elev 70. 0 and 76. 5. Relatively simple modifications of those designs that could extend their range of operation to pool elev 80. 0 were also developed. None of the plans was adequate at pool elev 82. 5...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{research}} and tools used for building evacuation planning {{do not take}} into account the common practice <b>of</b> using <b>ladders</b> for rescue operations. The ladders provide a simple and practical way of creating additional exits with a potential to significantly reduce the evacuation time. Use <b>of</b> <b>ladders</b> is critical in case of severe disasters and when some normal exits get blocked. To our knowledge, this paper presents the first systematic planning approach for optimal placement of a limited number <b>of</b> available <b>ladders.</b> We first propose modifications to the existing models of buildings to incorporate ladders and ladder points (locations in the building where ladders can be placed). Next, we develop optimization formulations to solve the following evacuation planning problems when a limited number <b>of</b> <b>ladders</b> are available: (i) optimal deployment of a given number <b>of</b> <b>ladders</b> to minimize evacuation time and (ii) finding minimum number <b>of</b> <b>ladders</b> along with their locations necessary to evacuate a building in a given evacuation time. These problems, posed as integer linear programming formulations, are applied to two case studies to demonstrate the importance <b>of</b> using <b>ladders.</b> The results show that evacuation plans can be significantly improved by optimally placing ladders at the selected ladder points.
