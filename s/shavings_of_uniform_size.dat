Here a facile method using premixed Shirasu Porous Glass (SPG) membrane emulsification technique was employed to fabricate uniform-sized emulsion and mechanical stirring was employed to prepare non-uniform-sized emulsion as control. In release kinetics studies, uniform-sized emulsion showed low initial release, and during the followed 17 days, uniform-sized emulsions released antigen faster than emulsions of non-uniform size. In addition, vaccination studies against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and avian Influenza virus (AIV) demonstrated that emulsion <b>of</b> <b>uniform</b> <b>size</b> induced higher HI antibodies and antigen-specific IgG titers. Furthermore, chickens vaccinated with emulsion <b>of</b> <b>uniform</b> <b>size</b> had a significantly greater ratio of CD 8 (+) T cells to CD 4 (+) T cells and a higher percentage of CD 8 (+) CD 4 (+) T cells. Taken together, these results indicated that emulsion <b>of</b> <b>uniform</b> <b>size</b> induced a more potent immune response than emulsion prepared by mechanical stirring, and warranted the use of SPG membrane emulsification technique in generating new avian vaccines.
