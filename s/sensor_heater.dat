30|$|From the {{experimental}} data shown in Fig.  2 a and Fig.  6 c, {{one can see}} that our nano-submicron-stripe dual-beam Pd sensors work well in detecting local weak temperature changes on a solid surface. When the sensor-heater distance {{is as close as}} 2  μm, as shown in Fig.  2 a, a local temperature fluctuation of 0.1  K is detectable. When the <b>sensor</b> <b>heater</b> distance is increased to 20  μm, the detectable ΔT is around 0.2 – 0.4  K. Therefore, we can expect that when the heating zone is located directly over the sensor, with an insulating space of 20 – 100  nm, for instance, the present dual-beam Pd sensors may ensure a resolution of 0.1  K with reliable stability.|$|E

Findings from real-world scenarios support the entire development process, {{particularly with regard to}} requirements and the functional description in the definition phase.

In order to enhance the accuracy of temperature measurement by the Pt T sensors, we investigated the correlation among the Pt T <b>sensor,</b> micro <b>heater,</b> and the working temperature, which was linear proportional relation expressed as the equation: T 2  =  6.466 R 1 – 642.8, where T 2  = temperature of the Pt micro heater and R 1  = the electrical resistance of the Pt T sensor.

40|$|AbstractThe optimum {{condition}} for identification of alcoholic gas by transient response of semiconductor gas sensor was clarified.

We have explored the optimum time change of the sensor temperature by using the model of transient response of semiconductor gas sensor which can calculate the transient response of gas sensor under various time changes of input heater voltages. It was found out that cubic root change of the temperature with time caused the largest separation among the transient responses for four kinds of alcoholic gases.

40|$|A {{system for}} {{measuring}} the noise parameters of a device at cryogenic temperatures is described. The method includes the thermal calibration of a module consisting of a noise diode, a dispersive coupling network, a temperature <b>sensor,</b> <b>heater,</b> and a bias-tee. The magnitude and phase of the reflection coefficient presented by the module vary rapidly with frequency and the noise output of the module can be thermally calibrated by changing {{the temperature of the}} module with an internal heater. The resulting variable impedance-calibrated noise source can be used to measure noise parameters of transistors or amplifiers over a frequency range of 0. 4 to 12 GHz via the wideband frequency-variation method. The calibration scheme is not unique to the module and may be applied in general to any noise source. Calibration and noise parameter measurements are made at cryogenic temperatures on a discrete transistor and two different low-noise amplifiers. The results are compared against theoretical values and those obtained using independent measurements. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first measurement of a transistor's noise parameters at cryogenic temperatures using such techniques...|$|E
40|$|Sensing {{mechanisms}} of gas sensors depend on temperature, {{and this is}} in particular true for metal-oxide semiconductors where the peculiar role of temperature suggested the modulation of temperature as a viable method to tune selectivity and sensitivity. This principle was widely investigated in the past, and methods to design ad hoc temperature behaviors have been proposed. In this paper, instead of a priori temperature profiles, a self-adaptive temperature modulation is proposed. For the scope, a closed-loop circuit connecting the sensor resistance to the <b>sensor</b> <b>heater</b> is designed. In this condition changes in sensor resistance are reflected into changes of operating temperature. Herewith, the method is implemented with an oscillatory circuit, so with a steady resistance value the signal driving the temperature modulation converges to a periodic pattern of pulses that is specific for the sensor state. Since the relationship between resistance and temperature may depend on {{the quality and quantity}} of the gas at which the sensor is exposed, the temperature modulation signal is likely dependent on the kind of gas and its concentration. As a consequence, features describing the temperature modulation signal pattern can be used as a multicomponent variable that can allow for gas identification and quantification. The hypothesis is confirmed by simulations with electronics CAD software and experiments with a commercial metal-oxide semiconductor gas sensor. Results show that optimal gas identification and concentration are simultaneously possible with a unique sensor device...|$|E

40|$|Aiming at {{applications}} in space exploration {{as well as}} for monitoring natural hazards, this thesis focuses on understanding and overcoming the challenges of extending the applicability of microsystems to temperatures above 600 °C as well as chemically harsh environments. Alumina and zirconia high-temperature co-fired ceramics (HTCC) with platinum as the conductor material, have in this thesis, been used to manufacture a wide range of high-temperature tolerant miniaturized sensors and actuators, including pressure and flow sensors, valves, a combustor, and liquid monopropellant microthrusters. Interfacing for high temperatures is challenging. One solution is to transfer the signal wirelessly. Here, therefor, wireless pressure sensors have been developed and characterized up to 1000 °C. It is usually unwanted that material properties change with temperature, but by using smart designs, such changes can be exploited to sense physical properties as in the gas flow sensor presented, where the temperature-dependent electrical conductivity of zirconia has been utilized. In the same manner, various properties of platinum have been exploited to make temperature <b>sensors,</b> <b>heaters</b> and catalytic beds. By in-situ electroplating metals after sintering, even more capabilities were added, since many metals that do not tolerate HTCC processing can be added for additional functionality. An electroplated copper layer that was oxidized and used as an oxygen source in an alumina combustor intended for burning organic samples prior to sample analysis in a lab on a chip system, and a silver layer used as a catalyst in order to decompose hydrogen peroxide in a microthuster for spacecraft attitude control, are both examples that have been explored here. Ceramics are both high-temperature tolerant and chemically resistant, making them suitable for both thrusters and combustors. The corresponding applications benefit from miniaturization of them in terms of decreased mass, power consumption, integration potential, and reduced sample waste. Integrating many functions using as few materials as possible, is important when it comes to microsystems for harsh environments. This thesis has shown the high potential of co-fired ceramics in manufacturing microsystems for aggressive environments. However, interfacing is yet a major challenge to overcome...|$|R
