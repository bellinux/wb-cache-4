5|$|A {{possible}} transitional form of microorganism {{between a}} prokaryote and a eukaryote {{was discovered in}} 2012 by Japanese scientists. Parakaryon myojinensis is a unique microorganism larger than a typical prokaryote, but with nuclear material enclosed in a membrane as in a eukaryote, {{and the presence of}} endosymbionts. This is <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> be the first plausible evolutionary form of microorganism, showing a stage of development from the prokaryote to the eukaryote.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} in August 1299, Lamberton was Guardian of Scotland and Nicholas became his close associate. Nicholas can be <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> have benefited as a result. He became Chancellor of Scotland by 30 January 1301. Balmyle's pension for being Chancellor {{was to be}} paid by Arbroath Abbey, for which the abbey later fell into arrears.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in late 1933 and {{escalating}} {{throughout the}} first half of 1934, American Roman Catholics launched a campaign against what they deemed the immorality of American cinema. This, plus a potential government takeover of film censorship and social research seeming to indicate that movies which were <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> be immoral could promote bad behavior, was enough pressure to force the studios to capitulate to greater oversight.|$|E

Lord Decimus, though {{one of the}} {{greatest}} of the earth, was not remarkable for ingratiatory manners, and Ferdinand had coached him up to the point of noticing all the fellows he might find there, and saying he was glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them. When he had achieved this rush of vivacity and condescension, his Lordship composed himself into the picture after Cuyp, and made a third cow in the group.|$|R

5|$|CSF {{returns to}} the {{vascular}} system by entering the dural venous sinuses via arachnoid granulations. These are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage. This occurs because of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses. CSF has also been <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> drain into lymphatic vessels, particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known, but may involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the neonate. CSF turns over {{at a rate of}} three to four times a day. CSF has also been <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> be reabsorbed through the sheathes of cranial and spinal nerve sheathes, and through the ependyma.|$|E
5|$|Christin {{has also}} cited the whodunit genre—notably novels by Georges Simenon and Ed McBain—as an {{influence}} on Valérian since they taught him, as a writer, that all characters in a narrative must be <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> have motivations.|$|E

5|$|Grissom {{is often}} {{regarded}} as well-educated, but unusual in his approach toward {{his work and}} social life. In the series, some of his comments and actions can be <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> dumbfound his co-workers and superiors. His relationship with his subordinates in the office is portrayed as being a father figure to the team, but very professional in his work.|$|E
5|$|He {{has been}} {{acclaimed}} {{as one of}} the greatest poets in Hindi, Indian, and world literature.

5|$|In the Tokyo Woman's Christian College, {{commenced}} in 1924, Raymond's architecture can be <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> {{still be}} {{heavily influenced by}} Wright. Its low, hipped roof and overhanging eaves are reminiscent of Wright's Prairie Houses. This early work also demonstrates his interest in Czech Cubism {{and the work of}} Auguste Perret.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms {{can form}} an endosymbiotic {{relationship}} with other, larger organisms. For example, microbial symbiosis plays {{a crucial role}} in the immune system. The microorganisms that make up the gut flora in the gastrointestinal tract contribute to gut immunity, synthesize vitamins such as folic acid and biotin, and ferment complex indigestible carbohydrates. Some microorganisms that are <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> be beneficial to health are termed probiotics and are available as dietary supplements, or food additives.|$|E
5|$|Norway's {{architectural}} {{trends are}} also <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> parallel political and societal changes in Norway over the centuries. Prior to the Viking Age, wooden structures {{developed into a}} sophisticated craft evident in the elegant and effective construction of the Viking longships. Following that, the ascent of Christianity introduced Romanesque architecture in cathedrals and churches, with characteristically slightly pointed arches, barrel vaults, cruciform piers supporting vaults, and groin vaults; in large part {{as a result of}} religious influence from England.|$|E

5|$|Other related {{studies have}} also shown {{evidence}} of synaptic alterations and their loss, in the ageing brain. Changes in gene expression alter the levels of proteins in various pathways {{and this has been}} shown to be evident in synaptic contact dysfunction or loss.
