25|$|On 13 March 1939, Hitler invited Monsignor Jozef Tiso, (the Slovak ex-prime {{minister}} {{who had been}} deposed by Czechoslovak troops several days earlier), to Berlin and urged him to proclaim Slovakia's independence. Hitler added that, if Tiso did not consent, he would {{have no interest in}} Slovakia's fate and would leave it to the territorial claims of Hungary and Poland. During the meeting, Joachim von Ribbentrop passed on a report claiming that Hungarian troops were approaching the Slovak borders. Tiso refused to make such a decision himself, after which he was allowed by Hitler to organise a meeting of the <b>Slovak</b> <b>parliament</b> ("Diet of the Slovak Land") which would approve Slovakia's independence.|$|E
25|$|In August 2006, a few {{incidents}} {{motivated by}} ethnic hatred caused diplomatic tensions between Slovakia and Hungary. The mainstream media {{in these countries}} blamed Slota's anti-Hungarian statements from the early summer for the worsening ethnic relations. The Party of European Socialists (PES), with which the Smer is affiliated, regards SNS as a party of the racist far-right and expressed grave concern regarding the coalition. The PES suspended Smer's membership on 12 October 2006 and decided to review the situation in June 2007. The decision was then extended until February 2008, when Smer's candidacy was readmitted by PES. On 27 September 2007, the <b>Slovak</b> <b>parliament</b> rejected both principle of collective guilt and attempts to reopen post-war documents which had established the current order.|$|E
25|$|Dzurinda entered Slovak {{politics}} {{as one of}} the founding members of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), a conservative political party officially constituted in 1990. The first democratic general election in Czechoslovakia was held in 1990, and he was appointed Deputy Minister of Transportation and Posts of the Slovak Government in 1991. In 1992 he {{became a member of the}} <b>Slovak</b> <b>parliament</b> (National Council of the Slovak Republic, and worked as a member of the Committee for Budget and Finance. At the time of the split of Czechoslovakia and the establishment of an independent Slovakia (1993), he was KDH Deputy Chairman responsible for economy. During the tenure of Jozef Moravčík as Prime Minister (March–October 1994), Dzurinda was Minister of Transportation, Posts and Public Works. Following the 1994 general election, won by Vladimír Mečiar, he returned to the opposition benches in the parliament.|$|E

500|$|Bratislava is the political, {{cultural}} and economic centre of Slovakia. It is {{the seat of the}} <b>Slovak</b> president, the <b>parliament</b> and the <b>Slovak</b> Executive.

25|$|On 14 March, the <b>Slovak</b> <b>parliament</b> convened {{and heard}} Tiso's report on his {{discussion}} with Hitler {{as well as}} on a possible declaration of independence. Some of the deputies were skeptical of making such a move, among other reasons {{due to the fact that}} some worried that the Slovak state would be too small and with a strong Hungarian minority. The debate was quickly brought to a head when Franz Karmasin, leader of the German minority in Slovakia, said that any delay in declaring independence would result in Slovakia being divided between Hungary and Germany. Under these circumstances, Parliament unanimously declared Slovak independence, thus creating the first Slovak state in history. Jozef Tiso was appointed the first Prime Minister of the new republic. The next day, Tiso sent a telegram (which had actually been composed the previous day in Berlin) asking the Reich to take over the protection of the newly minted state. The request was readily accepted.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002 before Slovakia and Hungary {{joined the}} European Union in 2004, Hungarian {{politician}} Viktor Orbán demanded {{the repeal of}} the Beneš decrees, but the European Parliament asserted that [...] "the decrees did not constitute an insurmountable obstacle to accession." [...] Slovak politician Monika Beňová-Flašiková accused the Hungarian politicians for pushing [...] "revanchist" [...] policies which could destabilize Europe. Later on the Hungarian members of the <b>Slovak</b> <b>parliament</b> requested for compensation and for a symbolic apology to the victims of the expulsions. As an answer, the Slovak government adopted a resolution in September 2007 which declared that the Beneš decrees are inalterable.|$|E

50|$|On 11 October 2011, the National Council of the <b>Slovak</b> Republic, the <b>parliament</b> of Slovakia, {{voted on}} whether to approve the {{expansion}} of the European Financial Stability Fund. As Slovakia was the last eurozone country to vote on the measure, prime minister Iveta Radičová of the Slovak Democratic and Christian Union - Democratic Party (SDKÚ) made it a vote of confidence. The motion was called on the grounds, according to the Freedom and Solidarity (SaS) party, that Slovakia, the second poorest eurozone country, should not bail out richer countries such as Greece in the interest of bank re-capitalisation. The motion then failed by 21 votes after SaS and Direction - Social Democracy (Smer-SD) abstained.|$|R
50|$|On 5 and 6 June 1992, {{elections}} were {{held for the}} Federal Assembly of the Czech and <b>Slovak</b> Federative Republic (<b>parliament),</b> the Czech National Council, and the Slovak National Council. In the Czech Republic, the Civic Democratic Party won the election; in its electoral programme, the party spoke of either a functional federation, or separation, although keeping the federation was the preferred option. In Slovak Republic, the winner was the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, whose election promise was to acquire international legal subjectivity for Slovakia - although this was clearly inconsistent with {{the continuation of the}} shared state, the party convinced voters that it did not rule out the existence of the federation.|$|R
2500|$|Slovak {{nationalist}} {{demands for}} a language law detaining the use of Hungarian in public institutions already appeared in 1990. Finally, the Meciar government pushed through legislation restricting the use of minority languages in public institutions. In 1995, the <b>Slovak</b> <b>Parliament</b> passed Act No 270 on the State Language of Slovakia, which came into power on 1 January 1996. This act revoked the more tolerant Act No 428 passed in 1990. The 1995 act emphasized {{the significance of the}} Slovak language for Slovak nationalism and statehood, by consolidating the exclusivist monolingualism. The new act considerably limited the use of minority languages, that is, of Hungarian, which had featured on bilingual signposts with placenames in predominantly Hungarian areas, and in bilingual school certificates issued to students in Hungarian minority schools. According to Duray: [...] "An official language law was promulgated providing the legal framework for the official use of the Slovak language not only in official communications but also in everyday commerce, in the administration of religious bodies, and even in the realm of what is normally considered private interaction, for example, communications between patient and physician." [...] In 1999, the Dzurinda government passed Act No 184 on the Use of the Languages of the Minority Communities, which reintroduced the institution of bilingual school certificates and provided that in communes with more than 20 percent of inhabitants belonging to a given minority, the minority language can be used in administration, and signposts with placenames can be bilingual. Furthermore, Article 10, prohibiting doing business and drafting contracts in any other language but Slovak, was abolished from the Act. However the act limits itself to only official contacts with the state and thus fails to overcome the 1996 act ensuring the use of Slovak in culture, schools and media. Language rights in education have also been a sphere of antagonism between the Slovak state and the Hungarian minority. Bilingual education in priamary and secondary schools is currently permitted. However, the array of subjects that should be taught in each language remained a highly contested issue. Government proposals prior to the 1998 elections (i.e. under Mečiar's government) even suggested that certain subjects should be taught only by teachers of 'Slovak origin' to ensure that the Slovak population living in areas with significant Hungarian populations should be able to assimilate themselves into mainstream Slovak life. According to Duray: [...] "On March 12, 1997 (i.e. under Mečiar's government), the Undersecretary of Education sent a circular to the heads of the school districts making known the following regulations: In Hungarian schools the Slovak language should be taught exclusively by native speakers. The same exclusion criteria applies to non-Slovak schools in the teaching of geography and history. (The Undersecretary modified the language of this regulation later by changing the term [...] "exclusively" [...] for [...] "mainly".) In communities where the Hungarian community exceeds 40% of the total population the teachers of Slovak schools receive supplementary pay. In all communities which include a Hungarians population and where there is no school or there is no Slovak school, wherever possible a Slovak school should be opened, but not a Hungarian one." [...] At the end of the 1998 school year a large number of Hungarian pupils handed back their school report that were issued only in Slovak.|$|E

This thesis provides empirical findings in the field of the usage of the EWM. In particular it focuses on the adaption of the Czech, <b>Slovak,</b> and Polish <b>parliaments</b> to the EWM and analyses whether the understanding of the principle of subsidiarity by the respective chambers influences their activity in the EWM. This thesis combines a broad range of data sources including: firstly, primary sources such as official documents, reasoned opinions available from relevant databases (IPEX) and a questionnaire filled out by the parliamentary staff; secondly, secondary sources such as previous research in the field, and lastly direct observations. This study concludes that subsidiarity control is understood by the national parliaments as a tool to defend their legislative prerogatives.
