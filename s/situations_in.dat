5|$|Despite the {{religious}} references in the series, Nakamura stated she used only her personal knowledge and {{some aspects of}} modern society, such as yakuza and blogging, which were {{not intended to be}} critical but were added because they fit the story. Similarly, secondary characters were only introduced in the series if a chapter needed a new character to introduce a topic. The themes of the chapters were created before the situations and jokes. However, if Nakamura had a specific theme, she created several jokes and then connected them to form a story. When creating a simpler chapter as compared to the more elaborate, thematic ones, she wrote without worrying about creating jokes and <b>situations</b> <b>in</b> advance. With the help of her four assistants, on average she took between ten days and two weeks to make a complete chapter.|$|E

In the case of Turner, however, not only do her vehicles furnish characters and <b>situations</b> <b>in</b> accord with her off-screen image, but frequently incidents in them echo incidents in her life so {{that by the end of}} her career films like Peyton Place, Imitation of Life, Madame X and Love Has Many Faces seem in parts like mere illustrations of her life.|$|E

The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people had}} {{attempted}} to add tracks to moving machines.

The center of innovation was in England, and in the same year Holt traveled to England to learn more about ongoing development. During that period, the chief engineer (and managing director) of Richard Hornsby & Sons in Grantham, England, David Roberts, was experimenting with a chain-track. Hornsby's design incorporated a steering clutch that varied the speed of each set of wheels, allowing the operator to turn the tractor by retarding one tread or the other. Roberts of Hornsby & Sons obtained a patent for their design in July 1904.|$|E
