5|$|With its slender, lithe body, the whitetip reef shark {{specializes in}} wriggling into narrow crevices and {{holes in the}} reef and extracting prey {{inaccessible}} to other reef sharks. Alternatively, it is rather clumsy when attempting to take food suspended in open water. This species feeds mainly on bony fishes, including eels, squirrelfishes, snappers, damselfishes, parrotfishes, <b>surgeonfishes,</b> triggerfishes and goatfishes, as well as octopuses, spiny lobsters, and crabs. The whitetip reef shark is highly responsive to the olfactory, acoustic, and electrical cues given off by potential prey, while its visual system is attuned more to movement and/or contrast than to object details. It is especially sensitive to natural and artificial low-frequency sounds in the 25100Hz range, which evoke struggling fish.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} mating systems among teleosts. Some species are promiscuous, where {{both males and}} females breed with multiple partners and there are no obvious mate choices. This has been recorded in Baltic herring, guppies, Nassau groupers, humbug damselfish, cichlids and creole wrasses. Polygamy, where one sex has multiple partners can come in many forms. Polyandry consists of one adult female breeding with multiple males, which only breed with that female. This is rare among teleosts, and fish in general, but is found in the clownfish. In addition, it may also exist to an extent among anglerfish, where some females have more than one male attached to them. Polygyny, where one male breeds with multiple females, is much more common. This is recorded in sculpins, sunfish, darters, damselfish and cichlids where multiple females may visit a territorial male that guards and takes care of eggs and young. Polygyny may also involve a male guarding a harem of several females. This occurs in coral reef species, such as damselfishes, wrasses, parrotfishes, <b>surgeonfishes,</b> triggerfishes and tilefishes.|$|E

25|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is highly}} {{responsive}} to olfactory, acoustic, and electrical cues given off by potential prey. Its visual system is attuned more to movement and/or contrast than to object details. It is especially sensitive to natural and artificial low-frequency {{sounds in the}} 25100Hz range, which evoke struggling fish. They hunt primarily at night, when many fishes are asleep and easily taken. After dusk, a group of sharks may target the same prey item, covering every exit route from a particular coral head. Each shark hunts for itself and in competition with the others in its group. They feed mainly on bony fishes, including eels, squirrelfishes, snappers, damselfishes, parrotfishes, <b>surgeonfishes,</b> triggerfishes, and goatfishes, as well as octopus, spiny lobsters, and crabs. Important predators of the whitetip reef shark include tiger sharks and Galapagos sharks.|$|E

50|$|Epulopisciums {{functions}} {{rely heavily}} on the daily activity of the brown <b>surgeonfish.</b> During the day, the bacteria is active, restraining the pH within the <b>surgeonfishs</b> gut. It also reproduces during the day. During the darker portions of the day, Epulopiscium finishes its reproduction and becomes inactive and immobile, which causes the pH level in the <b>surgeonfishs</b> gut to rise. The control that the bacteria plays over the pH level in the <b>surgeonfishs</b> gut plays {{a large role in}} the fishs digestion because the fish is an algae-feeding herbivore that also feeds on detritus.|$|R

40|$|Mimicry is {{a widely}} {{documented}} phenomenon in coral reef fishes, but the underlying relationships between mimics and models are poorly understood. Juveniles of the <b>surgeonfish</b> Acanthurus pyroferus mimic the coloration of different pygmy angelfish Centropyge spp. at different locations throughout the geographic range of the <b>surgeonfish,</b> while adopting a common species-specific coloration as adults. This study examines the ecological and behavioural relationships between A. pyroferus {{and one of its}} models, Centropyge vroliki, in Papua New Guinea. <b>Surgeonfish</b> underwent a transition from the juvenile (mimetic) coloration to the adult (non-mimetic) coloration when they reached the maximum size of the angelfish. As typical of mimic-model relationships, mimic <b>surgeonfish</b> were always less abundant than their model. Spatial variation in the abundance of mimics was correlated with models, while the abundance of adults was not. We show that juvenile <b>surgeonfish</b> gain a foraging advantage by mimicking the angelfish. Mimic <b>surgeonfish</b> were always found within 1 - 2 m of a similar-sized individual of C. vroliki with which they spent c. 10 % of their time in close association. When in association with angelfish, juvenile <b>surgeonfish</b> exhibited an increase of c. 10 % in {{the amount of time spent}} feeding compared to when they were alone. This foraging benefit seems to be explained by reduced aggression by the territorial damselfish Plectroglyphidon lacrymatus, which dominates the reef crest habitat. While adult A. pyroferus and all other <b>surgeonfish</b> were aggressively displaced from damselfish territories, mimic <b>surgeonfish</b> and their models were attacked less frequently and were not always displaced. Stomach contents analysis showed that the diet of C. vroliki differed substantially from P. lacrymatus, while that of A. pyroferus was more similar to the damselfish. We hypothesize that mimics deceive damselfish as to their diet in order to gain access to food supplies in defended areas...|$|R
