25|$|On {{passenger}} cars, the CHMSL may {{be placed}} above the back glass, {{affixed to the}} vehicle's interior just inside the back glass, {{or it may be}} integrated into the vehicle's deck lid or into a spoiler. Other specialised fitments are sometimes seen; the Jeep Wrangler and Land Rover Freelander have the CHMSL on a stalk fixed to the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>carrier.</b> Trucks, vans and commercial vehicles sometimes have the CHMSL mounted to the trailing edge of the vehicle's roof. The CHMSL is required by regulations worldwide to be centred laterally on the vehicle, though UN Regulation 48 permits lateral offset of up to 15cm if the vehicle's lateral centre is not coincident with a fixed body panel, but instead separates movable components such as doors. The Renault Master and Ford Transit van, for example, uses a laterally offset CHMSL for this reason. The height of the CHMSL is also regulated, in absolute terms and with respect to the mounting height of the vehicle's conventional left and right stop lamps. Depending on the left and right lamps' height, the lower edge of the CHMSL may be just above the left and right lamps' upper edge.|$|E

2500|$|The Superlight is {{available}} in both S3 and SV chassis sizes. The list of standard equipment reflects the Superlight's bias to track work: wide-track front suspension, 6 speed gearbox, carbon fibre dashboard and front wings, GRP aeroscreen and seats, racing harness, removable steering wheel. Quoted weight for the Superlight is about [...] less than the Roadsport, {{due in part to}} the lack of a <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> and <b>carrier.</b> All Superlight cars use the 2 litre Ford Duratec engine in differing states of tune; the R400 with [...] and R500 with [...] Caterham used to manufacture an R300 using the same engine at 175bhp, but this car has effectively now become the Supersport R.

Quoted performance for the R500 is 0-60 in 2.88 seconds and a top speed of [...] In October 2012 a supercharged model ('R600') for a race-series above the R300-class was released, including slick tyres and a sequential gearbox.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> cover or <b>spare</b> tire {{cover is}} an {{accessory}} {{that covers the}} <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> mounted on external part of a car or van. On 4x4 vehicles the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> is normally rear mounted and is often printed with a dealer's name or something more fun. Covers can be hard shells or soft vinyl covers. <b>Spare</b> <b>wheel</b> cover protects <b>spare</b> tires from the dirt and the sun's harmful UV rays in areas with many days of sunshine. <b>Spare</b> <b>wheel</b> covers need to be removed {{once in a while}} and cleaned.|$|R
50|$|The Discovery Sport will {{initially}} be sold with alloy wheels {{ranging from}} 18 in to 20 in in diameter. Various emergency <b>spare</b> <b>wheels</b> options are available depending on vehicle configuration: a full-size <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> mounted internally under {{the floor of}} the trunk, or if the 5+2 seating option is fitted it will be a 'space-saver' <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> mounted {{on the underside of the}} car, directly under the boot. It is not possible to have a factory-fitted tow bar with a <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> on 5+2 seat vehicles as they mount in the same place under the vehicle, so a tyre repair system of sealant and a compressor is supplied instead.|$|R
50|$|Taking {{a design}} {{lead from the}} US parent, a well overdue new 10/12/15 cwt range was {{therefore}} decided upon, {{to be of the}} forward control type all based on the same 'outrigger' chassis. With regard to this 'outrigger chassis', Cab and chassis windscreen variants, (subsequently described as 'open' back) differed from the van, estate car, and express bus body models, (subsequently described as 'closed' back) models by the addition of an extra rear crossmember to support the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>carrier</b> and to close the rear ends of the chassis horns. On the 'closed' back models the nature of the rear bodywork meant the rear crossmember could be omitted for this purpose.|$|E
