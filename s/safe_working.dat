5|$|Barlow was {{an early}} {{experimenter}} with civil engineering uses for steel, carrying out research at Woolwich Arsenal in the 1850s and {{being a member of}} the Institution of Civil Engineers' committee on the subject. From 1873 he was a member of a Board of Trade committee which produced the first recommendations on <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> loads for steel in railway structures in 1877.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} {{are more}} susceptible than aluminium to external corrosion, particularly in seawater, and may be galvanized or coated with corrosion barrier paints to resist corrosion damage. It {{is not difficult to}} monitor external corrosion, and repair the paint when damaged, and steel cylinders which are well maintained have a long service life, often longer than aluminium cylinders, as they are not susceptible to fatigue damage when filled within their <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> pressure limits.|$|E
5|$|The {{line had}} been built single track throughout, with the only {{run-around}} loop provided at Amlwch, meaning that trains could not pass each other. To ensure <b>safe</b> <b>working,</b> the Staff and Ticket system was used in three sections: Gaerwen-Llangefni, Llangefni-Llanerchymedd, and Llanerchymedd-Amlwch, using A and B configured staffs alternately. No turntable was built, as the intended Fairlie engines would not require one. When the LNWR provided engines, they used tank engines where possible, rather than an engine with a tender.|$|E

5|$|Cylinder working {{pressure}} is specified at a reference temperature, usually 15°C or 20°C. and cylinders {{also have a}} specified maximum <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> temperature, often 65°C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with temperature, as described by the gas laws, but this is acceptable {{in terms of the}} standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to the reference temperature does not exceed the specified {{working pressure}} stamped on the cylinder. This allows cylinders to be safely and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the specified working pressure when the filling temperature is greater than the reference temperature, but not more than 65°C, provided that the filling pressure does not exceed the developed pressure for that temperature, and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at the correct working pressure when cooled to the reference temperature.|$|E
5|$|The delegates {{voted to}} address the {{platform}} before deciding on nominees, and debate began when they reconvened at 8:45p.m. Many fights and compromises had been hashed out in the Resolutions Committee already, but the delegates insisted on debating several provisions. On many planks, there was widespread agreement among the delegates. On the monetary issue, the platform declared that all money, whether metal or paper, should be issued by the government, not by banks (as was common for paper money at the time). They also called for the unlimited coinage of silver and the repayment of the national debt in bonds, rather than gold dollars. Other planks of the platform called for a graduated income tax, laws to mandate <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> conditions in factories, the regulation of interstate commerce, {{and an end to}} child and convict labor; all of these were familiar parts of Greenback platforms from earlier elections, and provoked no serious dissent.|$|E

50|$|A further {{advantage}} of the lamella clarifier is its distinct absence of mechanical, moving parts. The system therefore requires no energy input except for the influent pump and has a much lower propensity for mechanical failure than other clarifiers. This advantage extends to safety considerations when operating the plant. The absence of mechanical parts results in a <b>safer</b> <b>working</b> environment, with less possibility for injury.|$|R
25|$|Measurements {{within the}} reactor/turbine buildings, {{but not in}} the {{basement}} and trench areas, were made on 18 April. These robotic measurements indicated up to 49mSv/h in unit 1 and 57mSv/h in unit 3. This is substantially lower than the basement and trench readings, but still exceeds <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> levels without constant worker rotation. Inside primary containment, levels are much higher.|$|E
25|$|In 1943, Wallace made a {{goodwill}} tour of Latin America, {{shoring up}} support among important allies. His trip proved a success, and helped persuade twelve countries {{to declare war}} on Germany. Regarding trade relationships with Latin America, he convinced the BEW to add labor clauses to contracts with Latin American producers. These clauses required producers to pay fair wages and provide <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> conditions for their employees, and committed the United States to paying for {{up to half of}} the required improvements. This met opposition from the Department of Commerce.|$|E
25|$|Abolitionists {{who seek}} {{an end to}} sex {{trafficking}} explain the nature of sex trafficking as an economic supply and demand model. In this model, male demand for prostitutes leads to a market of sex work, which, in turn, fosters sex trafficking, the illegal trade and coercion of people into sex work, and pimps and traffickers become 'distributors' who supply people to be sexually exploited. The demand for sex trafficking can also be facilitated by some pimps' and traffickers' desire for women whom they can exploit as workers {{because they do not}} require wages, <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> circumstances, and agency in choosing customers.|$|E

25|$|Although China {{has grown}} tremendously in its economy {{over the past}} years, its {{economic}} growth has had minimal effect in mitigating the feminization of poverty. Economic growth did not reduce gender gaps in income or provide more formal employment opportunities for women. Instead, China's economic growth increased its use of informal employment, which has affected women disproportionately. In the Republic of Korea, low wages for women helped instigate an economic growth in Korea since low-cost exports were mostly produced by women. Similar to China, Korean women mostly had the opportunity for informal employment, which deprives women of financial stability and <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> environments. Although women in East Asia had greater access to employment, they faced job segregation in export industries, which placed them at {{a high risk of}} poverty.|$|E
25|$|Bismarck's {{idea was}} to {{implement}} welfare programs that were acceptable to conservatives without any socialistic aspects. He was dubious about laws protecting workers at the workplace, such as <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> conditions, limitation of work hours, and the regulation of women's and child labor. He believed that such regulation would force workers and employers to reduce work and production and thus harm the economy. Bismarck opened debate on the subject in November 1881 in the Imperial Message to the Reichstag, using the term practical Christianity to describe his program. Bismarck's program centred squarely on insurance programs designed to increase productivity, and focus the political attentions of German workers on supporting the Junkers' government. The program included sickness insurance, accident insurance, disability insurance, and a retirement pension, none of which were then in existence to any great degree.|$|E

25|$|An {{ironworker}} is the US {{term for}} a tradesman (man or woman) {{who works in the}} ironworking industry. A structural/ ornamental Ironworker, erects (or even dismantles) the structural steel framework of pre-engineered metal buildings, single and multi-story buildings, stadiums, arenas, hospitals, towers, wind turbines, and bridges. Ironworkers assemble the structural framework in accordance with engineered drawings. Ironworkers also unload, place and tie reinforcing steel bars (rebar) as well as install post-tensioning systems, both of which give strength to the concrete used in piers, footings, slabs, buildings and bridges. Ironworkers load, unload, place and set machinery and equipment and operate power hoists, forklifts, and aerial lifts. They unload, place and fasten metal decking, safety netting and edge rails to facilitate <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> practices. Ironworkers finish buildings by erecting curtain wall and window wall systems, pre-cast concrete and stone, stairs and handrails, metal doors, sheeting and elevator fronts. Ironworkers perform all types of industrial maintenance as well.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{existing}} narrow gauge between Stirling North and Port Augusta {{had been removed}} many years earlier, {{the challenge for the}} PRRPS was to develop an effective means of reinstating the narrow gauge in to Port Augusta. The greatest aspect to this challenge was how to cross over what remains of the standard gauge line to Marree, which has since been truncated at Leigh Creek {{with the opening of the}} newer standard gauge line from Tarcoola to Alice Springs in 1980. This line to Leigh Creek is exclusively used for transporting coal from Leigh Creek to Northern Power Station, and branches off the main standard gauge network at Stirling North. Many options for crossing this line were investigated, including a draw bridge arrangement, diamond crossovers and an underpass. The final decision was an underpass, passing below the Leigh Creek coal train line, which greatly reduced the amount of <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> interfacing with the standard gauge line.

25|$|Oscar Dyson has a traction-type oceanographic winch {{which can}} deploy up to 5,000 meters (16,404 feet) of 17-mm (0.67-inch) wire rope or other cable, {{including}} fiberoptic cable. She also has two hydrographic winches, {{each of which}} can deploy 3,600 meters (11,811 feet) of 9.5-mm (3/8-inch) EM cable, two trawl winches, each of which can deploy 4,300 meters (14,107 feet) of cable, and a Gilson winch. She has a 60-foot (18.3-meter) telescopic boom with a lifting capacity of 6,250 pounds (2,835 kg) aft and a 23-foot (7-meter) fixed boom with a lifting capacity of 1,000 pounds (454kg) at her bow. She has an A-frame on her starboard side with a <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> load of 8,050 pounds (3,651kg) and a large A-frame aft. The oceanographic winch and large after A-frame work in conjunction to serve her stern sampling station, while the two hydrographic winches work with the side A-frame to service her side sampling station, and the two hydrographic winches together give Oscar Dyson the capability to have two scientific packages ready for sequential operations. In addition to trawling, her sampling stations can deploy smaller sampling nets, longlines, and fish traps. The hydrographic winches can deploy CTD instruments to measure the electrical conductivity, temperature, and chlorophyll fluorescence of sea water. Oscar Dyson also can deploy specialized gear such as Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS) frames, towed vehicles, dredges, and bottom corers, and she can deploy and recover both floating and bottom-moored sensor arrays.|$|E
