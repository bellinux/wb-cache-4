40|$|Wet {{chemical}} {{surface treatment}} processes, as chromium plating for coating of components for hydraulic cylinders <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> <b>substituted</b> <b>by</b> new surfaces. These surfaces should {{on one hand}} side be less poluting for environment saving production {{and on the other}} hand side show less wear and have self friction behaviour. From literature and by experiance values coating systems were choosen. These are to be applied on test samples by Thermal coating process, PVD-process or by plasma nitriding. In a tribometer the Stribeck curves and the wear behaviour of a first set of test samples which had been coated by different materials under two typ of processes were measured (Screening phase). For measurement of the friction loading under presence of transvers loading at pressure differences up to 250 bar a test device were designed. The project was interrupted in August 1995 because of formal reasons. It will be continued by EUROFLAMM GmbH, Bremen. (orig.)

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of silicon tools and an appropriate hot embossing technology for polymers. With this technology, high quality embossing of optical or fluidic structure for high precision requirements in a batch process is possible thereby reducing system costs. Possible usage is the production of Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) for optical or fluidic applications. This could be sensors for chemical analysis of liquids or BioMEMS. Further promising applications are multifunctional printed circuit boards (PCB) or micro cooler. Up to now for coarser dimensions the use of conventional made (e. g. miling) steel tools is common. For forming of smallest structures down to the sub-micrometer range with excellent surface roughness LIGA technology is applied. However, {{in order to reduce the}} system costs LIGA tools <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> <b>substituted</b> <b>by</b> silicon tools. Deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) is used to fabricate such an embossing tools allowing complex geometrical figures. For fluidics or optical applications the tool structures have to show a tapered (positive) profile and sufficient low roughness. Roughness can be minimised by further oxidation and etch steps. The hot embossing experiments which will be presented show the capability of the optimised DRIE technology for the aimed application field...|$|E
