5|$|On Halloween day, {{she goes}} to the party store, but it is closed. However, the store manager appears and allows her into the shop. She dismisses the masks she sees on display as not good enough for scaring anyone. But she sneaks into a back room and discovers a row of hideously {{deformed}} masks. She is startled to find that the masks feel warm and like human skin, not rubber or plastic. The store owner reluctantly sells her one of the masks and Carly Beth goes home in delight. Later that day, after she takes the mold of her head that her mother made, <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> the mask and goes in search of Chuck and Steve, determined to get revenge on them. She starts acting more and more aggressively as the night goes on: she chokes Sabrina, throws apples at a house, and frightens children she doesn't know. When she manages to scare Chuck and Steve, she loses the head her mother made, but no longer cares.|$|E
25|$|The video {{begins with}} a small boy and girl playing on a {{playground}} together, teasingly pushing each other around. The young girl {{is intended to be}} Clarkson as a child, presumably with her young male best friend. The boy hands her a beaded necklace, which <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> admiringly. The shot closes in on the necklace, then pulls back to reveal it's still worn as a bracelet on the wrist of now-adult Clarkson, her boyfriend (played by Houston Rhines) shows up at her apartment door, presumably after an argument. Clarkson teases him with a set of keys, which she then throws down the toilet. The two are then shown sitting on a couch, reading magazines, when Clarkson grabs her boyfriend's magazine. The two are shown throwing various possessions of one another out of the apartment window, though in a playful manner. Such items include numerous articles of clothing, magazines, a guitar (which Clarkson tries to stop him throwing out), and a fishbowl (with the fish being taken out and put in a glass first, after which they look out the window). After throwing these items out the window, the two are seen sitting affectionately on the couch. Clarkson and her boyfriend are shown still fighting and bickering as they did as children, over the TV Guide and remote control. The latter portion of the video shows the two driving in a first generation Ford Bronco (with the necklace/bracelet hanging from the rear view mirror), eventually getting into an argument. Distracted by the tiff over directions, the Bronco nearly ends up in a head-on collision with an approaching car. After spinning out to avoid the crash, Clarkson simply grabs her boyfriend and pulls him into a kiss, where the video ends.|$|E

500|$|McCracken starred with Eddie Dowling, {{a veteran}} Broadway actor, {{in the play}} Angel in the Pawnshop, in a 1950 tour and on Broadway in 1951. She played a young woman seeking to escape her {{marriage}} from a homicidal thief, in a pawnshop owned by Dowling's character. While in the pawnshop, <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> old clothing and fantasizes that she is living in happier times. Although she engaged in some choreographed dancing during the play, it was a straight dramatic role. While the play was being prepared for Broadway, in October 1950, she appeared on television in the premiere of the Pulitzer Prize Playhouse, playing Essie in You Can't Take It with You. At that time, McCracken gave an interview disparaging what she described as the [...] "over-commercialization" [...] of television, which might have hurt her career in the new medium.

Though it is often {{hard for people to}} understand why she acts wayward, she also has the vulnerability factor. Halfpenny said she likes Amy's mischievous side and hoped she would not learn to be sensible. Halfpenny also felt it was important that Amy remained youthful because she disliked portrayals of teenagers growing up too quickly. She found it easy to portray a character younger than herself as she could base aspects of Amy's story on her own teenage experience. At times she is scared <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> a [...] "hard exterior". Amy has a distinct style, Halfpenny described it as being quite [...] "out there" [...] in her choice of clothing and make-up. Halfpenny said that viewers would not be getting used to Amy's [...] "nice side" [...] and reminded them that she is good at [...] "lying and scheming".

[...] Jen Aprahamian of Comic Vine said [...] "Ms. Marvel makes a delightful debut, showing confidence and heart even before <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> a mask. Kamala {{is not your}} average superheroine and her stories seem like they're headed in an exciting direction. Kudos to Marvel for expanding its range; amping up the diversity factor {{in a way that}} doesn't feel token or temporary is a great move, and Ms. Marvel is launching with a solid first issue and a worldâ€”a universe, evenâ€”of story possibilities." [...] Joshua Yehl of IGN said, [...] "Ms. Marvel introduces a vibrant and troubled character that you can't help but love." [...] George Marston of Newsarama said, [...] "Ms. Marvel is a solid debut issue, and that in itself should be a victory not just for G. Willow Wilson and Adrian Alphona, but for Marvel Comics itself... It's not exactly edgy, and Kamala Khan is not exactly the first reluctant teen hero in Marvel's long history, but Ms. Marvel is one of the strongest debuts for a new character that Marvel has had in a long time." ...|$|E

In the rap, Ivy Queen sings: [...] "1-9-9-3 was the year that I started, Many have seen my rise and fall I've seen many. Vigilant, I have an angel on my back, I have a throne flanked by holy souls." [...] Lyrically, Ivy Queen highlights her position as the queen of reggaeton.

Lyrically, the song describes when the passion in a relationship has been lost. [...] "Me Quiere" [...] (They Like Me) is an R power ballad built on a snapping rhythm. Also in a minor key, it features synthesizers and percussion. In the song, Queen says that people listen to her because they like her. The lyrics reveal that when she wants it smooth <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> R. Kelly, and when she is discontented she plays Mary J. Blige (both of whom Queen has said {{she would like to}} work with in the future). The song highlights her hip-hop status. [...] "De La Calle" [...] (From the Street) is an R power ballad exploring the love between two people ("love from the street"), with Queen and De La Ghetto reprising their 2006 collaboration on a remix of Luny Tunes' [...] "Noche de Entierro (Nuestro Amor)".|$|E

An editor of Billboard felt that she [...] "gets sexy" [...] in the song's visual. A writer of the website Fuse praised {{the concept of the}} video, noting that [...] "instead of crying into the steak she just made for her date, <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> a leather trench coat and hits the town.

Writing on behalf of Vanity Fair, Michelle Collins felt that the set was [...] "bizzaro", similar to a set as in the film Sliding Doors (1998). She further found several of the scenes to accompany the song's lyrics and story. Melissa Locker from Time magazine wrote in her review that the video follows the steps of [...] "Partition" [...] while also being a [...] "natural precursor to 'Irreplaceable,' at least in our imagination". Michael Zelenko from The Fader wrote that it served as a follow-up to [...] "Partition" [...] noting that in [...] "Jealous", [...] "Bey's lingering needs are transformed into a burning suspicion of infidelity".|$|E
