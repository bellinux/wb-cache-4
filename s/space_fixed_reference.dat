40|$|Two {{methods are}} {{presented}} for inviscid transonic flows: unsteady Euler equations in a rotating {{frame of reference}} for transonic-vortex flows and integral solution of full-potential equation with and without embedded Euler domains for transonic airfoil flows. The computational results covered: steady and unsteady conical vortex flows; 3 -D steady transonic vortex flow; and transonic airfoil flows. The results are in good agreement with other computational results and experimental data. The rotating frame of reference solution is potentially efficient {{as compared with the}} <b>space</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>reference</b> formulation with dynamic gridding. The integral equation solution with embedded Euler domain is computationally efficient and as accurate as the Euler equations...|$|E

We examine how many distinct permutations can occur {{as a function of}} the number of sites and the size of the space. We give theoretical results for tree metrics and vector spaces with L 1, L 2, and L∞ metrics, improving on the previous best known storage space in the vector case.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{ecosystem}} monitoring programs is {{to indicate the}} state of ecosystems and whether they have been impacted by activities such as fishing. This paper discusses a range of methods for inferring such impacts using monitoring data with no control sites. These methods assess either (i) the expected probability of an observed value in an unimpacted system, or (ii) the frequency of values below a <b>fixed</b> <b>reference</b> point. The second approach allows inference criteria based on changes in this frequency rather than by reference to a critical probability. All methods would have provided a sustained indication of a significant decline in Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) pup production at South Georgia from the early 1990 s {{within a few years}} of its onset, but a <b>fixed</b> <b>reference</b> point method could have provided this sustained indication from the onset. Furthermore, simulation of all methods suggests that the total probability of error (false positives and false negatives combined) is lowest with <b>fixed</b> <b>reference</b> point methods. The probabilities of Type I and Type II error can be evaluated analytically for these methods, which facilitates decision-making based on attitudes to risk...|$|R
