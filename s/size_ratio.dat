This new currency, however, had a silver purity of about 52% for the period between 215 and 217 and an actual <b>size</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1antoninianus to 1.5denarii.

The reduced silver purity of the coins caused people to hoard the old coins that had higher silver content, making the inflation problem caused by the earlier devaluation of the denarii worse than it had been before.|$|E
5|$|Cryptoprocta spelea is {{the only}} extinct carnivoran mammal known from Madagascar; {{recently}} extinct Madagascan animals also include at least 17species of lemurs, {{most of which are}} larger than the living forms, as well as elephant birds and Malagasy hippopotamuses, among others. Subfossil remains of the giant fossa have been found in Holocene cave sites from the northern end of Madagascar along the west coast to the far south, and in the central highlands. Some sites have yielded both C.spelea and smaller remains referable to the living species, C.ferox; however, lack of robust stratigraphic knowledge and no available radiocarbon dating on subfossil Cryptoprocta bones makes it uncertain whether the two species lived in the same region at the same time. The <b>size</b> <b>ratio</b> between the two species is within the range of ratios seen between similar-sized living cats and mongooses found in the same areas, suggesting that the two species may have been able to occur together.|$|E
5|$|Electrostatic forces between {{particles}} are strongest when {{the charges are}} high, and {{the distance between the}} nuclei of the ions is small. In such cases, the compounds generally have very high melting and boiling points and a low vapour pressure. Trends in melting points can be even better explained when the structure and ionic <b>size</b> <b>ratio</b> is taken into account. Above their melting point ionic solids melt and become molten salts (although some ionic compounds such as aluminium chloride and iron(III) chloride show molecule-like structures in the liquid phase). Inorganic compounds with simple ions typically have small ions, and thus have high melting points, so are solids at room temperature. Some substances with larger ions, however, have a melting point below or near room temperature (often defined as up to 100°C), and are termed ionic liquids. Ions in ionic liquids often have uneven charge distributions, or bulky substituents like hydrocarbon chains, which also play a role in determining the strength of the interactions and propensity to melt.|$|E

The profitability of a grid-connected PV system increases if the PV system is sized to reduce excess PV electrical energy fed to the grid when the feed-in tariff is lower than electricity buying price. The effect of feed-in tariffs on PV saving for selected European countries has been shown. The cost of the PV electricity depends on <b>sizing</b> <b>ratio,</b> PV and inverter lifetimes, cost ratio, PV inclination and financial parameters. The effect of cost ratio on the optimum PV/inverter <b>sizing</b> <b>ratio</b> is less significant when the cost ratio lies within 7 - 11. The minimum PV electricity cost at low and high insolation conditions were obtained for <b>sizing</b> <b>ratios</b> of 1. 6 and 1. 2, respectively.

5|$|Enterprise was {{the second}} Star Trek series to be {{released}} in high definition on Blu-ray following the earlier releases of Star Trek: The Next Generation, with season one delivered on March 26, 2013. The fans of the franchise were asked for feedback on potential covers for the first season release, but as there was no clear winner, a new design was created based on the feedback received. The second season was released on August 20, 2013, the third season was on January 7, 2014, and the final season on April 29, 2014. The Blu-ray releases featured both the same additional features as the DVD release, in addition to new features exclusive to these releases. In January 2017 a new 24 disc Blu-ray set of the whole series was released. This set includes the whole series in 1080p with a screen <b>size</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1.78:1 (widescreen) and with the sound in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (5 channels plus subwoofer).

We critically examine the recently proposed scaling {{of the species}} percolation velocity with the local shear rate for different inclination angles and <b>size</b> <b>ratios</b> for an equal volume mixture of large and small spherical particles. Our DEM simulations explore a much wider range of inclination angles and shear rates for three different <b>size</b> <b>ratios</b> of large and small particles. Our results suggest that while the scaling of percolation velocity with the shear rate seems to work well for any given inclination angle, this scaling is unable to capture the influence of inclination angle on the segregation. We overcome this limitation and propose a more appropriate way of scaling the percolation velocity. This scaling, when used along with the convection-diffusion equation, is able to predict the steady state segregation of binary mixtures flowing at different inclination angles for different <b>size</b> <b>ratios...</b>|$|R

While parrots are able to mimic human speech, studies with the African grey parrot have shown that some are able to {{associate}} words with their meanings and form simple sentences. Along with crows, ravens, and jays (family Corvidae), parrots are considered the most intelligent of birds. The brain-to body <b>size</b> <b>ratio</b> of psittacines and corvines is {{comparable to that of}} higher primates. One argument against the supposed intelligent capabilities of bird species is that birds have a relatively small cerebral cortex, which is {{the part of the brain}} considered the main area of intelligence in other animals. However, birds use a different part of the brain, the mediorostral HVC as the seat of their intelligence. These species tend to have the largest hyperstriata, and Harvey J. Karten, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, who studied bird physiology, has discovered that the lower part of the avian brain is functionally similar to that in humans.

The size of the largest (breeding) female and the minimum size difference required for hierarchy stability strongly but not perfectly predicted maximum group size, suggesting that social conflicts and hierarchy structure set the upper limit on group size. Deviations in group size around the predicted maximum were explained by variation in average body <b>size</b> <b>ratios</b> but not by variation in coral size, suggesting that coral size does not directly influence group size. In contrast, coral size {{was a significant predictor of}} body <b>size</b> <b>ratios,</b> and possible explanations for this relationship are discussed.
