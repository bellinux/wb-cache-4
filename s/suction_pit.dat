5000|$|Slow pump {{pressure}} is the circulating pressure (pressure used to pump fluid {{through the whole}} active fluid system, including the borehole and all the surface tanks that constitute the primary system during drilling) at a reduced rate. SPP is very important during a well kill operation in which circulation (a process in which drilling fluid is circulated out of the <b>suction</b> <b>pit,</b> down the drill pipe and drill collars, out the bit, up the annulus, {{and back to the}} pits while drilling proceeds) is done at a reduced rate to allow better control of circulating pressures and to enable the mud properties (density and viscosity) to be kept at desired values. The slow {{pump pressure}} can also be referred to as [...] "kill rate pressure" [...] or [...] "slow circulating pressure" [...] or [...] "kill speed pressure" [...] and so on.|$|E
40|$|The radon {{resistance}} of different residential construction features was evaluated for the Florida residential construction standard to distinguish regions requiring active radon controls from those where passive controls suffice. Radon resistance, {{defined as the}} ratio of reference indoor radon levels to levels with a particular construction feature, was estimated individually for candidate features using model simulations and indoor radon measurements. Active radon control by sub-slab ventilation (<b>suction</b> <b>pit</b> or ventilation mat systems) was most effective, followed by sub-slab vapor barriers, increased house ventilation, improved slab-foundation design, improved concrete quality, sealed slab cracks and openings, and sealed pipe penetrations. Sealing cracks related to slab reinforcement and soil compaction made little difference. For Florida residences, passive features reduce indoor radon {{by more than a}} factor of two, and active features give further reductions to exceed a factor of ten.

40|$|There {{are several}} Active Soil Depressurization (ASD) {{computer}} based models {{that have been}} specifically designed and calibrated for residential structure ASD system applications and mitigation practices. Large structures encountered in large buildings are significantly different than residential structures and consequently different treatments are required. Considerations for substantially larger slab sizes, slab shape, foundation type, construction soil, slab openings and other differences need to be accounted for {{in the design and}} operation of a Sub-Slab Depressurization (SSD) system for large building installations. A mathematical model that is based on the solution of both soil gas mass conservation and pressure driven flow equations in porous media is utilized. A computer code is developed using the model to simulate the operation of the SSD system for large slab on grade structures that are constructed on low permeability soil and fill materials. Finite difference techniques are employed to numerically solve the three dimensions partial differential equations of (lie model. Large structure features are compensated in the set of the model boundary conditions. The computer code is capable of predicting the pressure filed extension in the soil volume underneath the slab utilizing multi-suction points and different SSD operating considerations. It is also allows for examination of different SSD design parameters including {{the size and shape of}} (lie <b>suction</b> <b>pit(s)</b> andlor matting...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} devoted to the study of {{cavitation}} processes occurring in a gear pump with an external involute gear during the transportation of Newtonian fluids, determining the conditions for their appearance and studying the effect on their intensity of pump operating conditions in order to select the rational operating parameters of the equipment and improve the efficiency of the pump. For research purposes, an experimental booth designed for the study of hydraulic machines has been developed to measure the instantaneous values of pressure in the suction and inlet lines, as well as to conduct high-speed video recording of processes that occur 22 when using hydromachines. The video camera used in the study allows you to make up to 10, 000 frames per second, which made it possible to examine in detail the processes that occur during the pump operation. There was developed and created a physical model of a gear pump, and fluid flows in its internal channels were visualized, which allowed confirming the occurrence of cavitation in the trapped volume of a gear pump. The process is considered in detail and the places where cavitation phenomena appear in cavities of a gear pump are determined. As a result of rheological research, the rheological characteristics of the working fluid, HDZ 46 oils were obtained, it was determined that oils used as working fluids in the range of temperatures under consideration (+ 17 ?C [...] . + 50 ?C) behave like Newtonian fluids. A study was made of pressure pulsations in the pump lines, taking into account which a mathematical model was proposed for determining the velocity distribution along the pipeline section and the magnitude of the shear stresses. It was found that the velocities and shear stress in the flow that occurs under pressure that changes harmonically have a complicated form and varies over time. This should be taken into account in determining the hydraulic losses in the system. In the study of pressure pulsations, it was found that when changing the pressure in the suction line, the form of pressure pulsations in the injection line changes. Thus, at overpressure in the <b>suction</b> line <b>pits</b> appear in the ripple curve in comparison with the case when the pressure in the suction line is equal to the atmospheric pressure. And when pressure is reduced in the suction line to negative values, the curve of the pulsations of pressure is close to the pollen, with the gradual increase in pressure to the maximum value. The impact of the pump operating parameters on the intensity of cavitation phenomena that arise in the trapped volume during the operation was investigated. It was revealed that with increasing pressure in the suction chamber, the intensity of cavitation decreases. The intensity of the cavitation increases with the increase in the speed of gears and when the temperature of the working fluid increases, that is, when it decreases its viscosity. These studies allow you to develop recommendations for choosing pump parameters. The efficiency of the application of relief grooves was studied with the aim of reducing the intensity of cavitation phenomena. It has been found that existing grooves reduce the intensity of cavitation phenomena in the closed volume and suction chamber, but do not completely eliminate them. Based on the data of the visualization of the pump operation, a new shape of relief grooves is proposed, which enable to reduce the intensity of cavitation phenomena and provide, in comparison with the studied grooves, fewer leakages of the working fluid, increasing the efficiency of the pump. The method of influence on the intensity of cavitation phenomena by the influence of a magnetic field on a fluid pumped by a pump is proposed, in the case where the fluid is electrically conductive. Due to the action of the Lorentz forces, the extinction of vortices and cavitation phenomena occurs. ??????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????????, ???????????? ? ??????????? ?????? ? ??????? ???????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????????? ???????????? ?????????, ??????????? ??????? ?? ????????? ? ???????? ??????? ?? ?? ????????????? ??????? ??????? ?????? ? ????? ?????? ???????????? ???????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ? ????????? ????????????? ?????? ??????. ??????????? ? ??????? ?????????? ?????? ???????????? ?????? ? ????????? ???????????? ??????? ???????? ? ??? ?????????? ???????, ??? ????????? ??????????? ????????????? ????????? ? ????????? ?????? ???????????? ??????. ???????? ?????????? ??????? ? ?????????? ????? ????????? ????????????? ??????? ? ???????? ???????????? ??????. ????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ? ?????? ??????, ? ?????? ??????? ?????????? ?????????????? ?????? ??? ??????????? ????????????? ???????? ?? ??????? ???????????? ? ???????? ??????????? ??????????. ??????????? ????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????? ? ????? ???????? ????????????? ????????????? ???????. ?? ?????? ??????????? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ??????? ? ??????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????...|$|R
40|$|Six {{slab-on-grade}} {{houses in}} Polk County, Florida, with indoor radon levels between 19 and 80 pCi/ 1 were mitigated using sub-slab depressurization systems. With the compacted, moist soil fill under the slabs, sufficient sub-slab communications {{were difficult to}} establish. Increasing the <b>suction</b> <b>pit</b> size and using more powerful fans improved {{the strength of the}} pressure fields within 3 to 8 m of the suction holes but did little to extend them beyond this radius. The most effective means for extending the field was found to be installing additional suction holes (depressurized by the same fan) in locations where the pressure field was the weakest. Suction holes were placed both in centralized and in near-perimeter locations reached either by interior slab holes or through holes in the exterior stem wall. Indoor radon levels were measured using 2 -day charcoal canisters, continuous radon monitors, and long-term (3 mo- 1 yr) alpha track detectors. This paper has been reviewed in accordance with the U.
