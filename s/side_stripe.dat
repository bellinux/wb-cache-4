2500|$|In {{its first}} year, the American Rally AMX was cosmetically {{almost the same}} as its U.S. counterpart. Both {{versions}} shared the same rear louvers, fender extensions, front air dam, <b>side</b> <b>stripe,</b> body-colored bumpers with guards and nerfing strips, shell-type door mirrors, roof targa band, and mesh-grating grille design with round parking lights and central AMX emblem. The only different characteristics of the Mexican vehicle were the inhouse five-spoke wheels with chromed volcano hubcaps and trim rings, the presence of original [...] "Rally AMX" [...] decals just under the regular side stripes (replacing AMC's lower body [...] "AMX" [...] design for the model), the [...] "Rally" [...] and [...] "4.6" [...] emblems, {{and the lack of}} the [...] "Hornet in Flames" [...] hood decal. Another visual difference took place in the midyear as VAM's customers mostly rejected the mesh grille design as [...] "very simplistic and rough-looking". The company responded to the criticisms with an original grille design incorporating the rectangular parking lights placed vertically and between them, a set of three vertical lines (left, center, right), and a central horizontal line passing through them, behind this was a mesh grating half smaller in size as the original.|$|E

2500|$|Ford {{planned to}} {{introduce}} another limited edition Torino {{to once again}} dominate at NASCAR. The result was the 1970 Ford Torino King Cobra. Like the Talladega, the King Cobra was modified with aerodynamics specifically in mind and looked very different from a typical 1970 Torino. It had a sloped front end with dual headlamps located in sugar scoop shaped cut-outs on the front fenders, similar in appearance to the Datsun 240Z. The King Cobra's grille was a large opening below the front bumper, much like the bottom breather design now used in some modern cars. Parking lamps were located between the headlamps, molded into the front fascia. The hoods had a blacked-out center portion, and a <b>side</b> <b>stripe</b> similar to 1968-69 Torino GTs ran from the front fender to quarter panel. Ford planned to offer covers for the headlight cutouts to NASCAR teams to improve aerodynamics even further. [...] In actuality it is said the front end created too much down force. [...] In addition to no rear down force creation this caused the car to become very loose in turns as per Musclecar Review.|$|E

5000|$|Along {{with the}} body {{redesign}} and the 420 hp in the 2013 Mustang, the GT/CS also received a slight update. The <b>side</b> <b>stripe</b> was moved {{from the middle of}} the door to the bottom of the body in the same location as the GT500 <b>side</b> <b>stripe.</b> The stripe was also featured along the body lines on the hood of the car. The heat extractors now featured on the 2013 Mustang GT's hood are painted black instead of body color. The 19" [...] wheels are also black with chrome accent and a 5-spoke design. The interior was updated with Alcantara-style inserts in the seats and doors where the 2011/12 model year sported a faux carbon fiber pattern. The package cost $1,995.00 USD.|$|E
