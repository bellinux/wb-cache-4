Steam locomotives were temporarily banned from using the station, with Hastings Units being introduced into service earlier than planned. A full service was resumed from 6 May.

5|$|In Ratner's view, {{the most}} {{important}} of Saint-Saëns's chamber works are the sonatas: two for violin, two for cello, and one each for oboe, clarinet and bassoon, all seven with piano accompaniment. The First Violin Sonata dates from 1885, and is rated by Grove's Dictionary as one of the composer's best and most characteristic compositions. The Second (1896) <b>signals</b> <b>a</b> stylistic change in Saint-Saëns's work, with a lighter, clearer sound for the piano, characteristic of his music from then onwards. The First Cello Sonata (1872) was written after the death of the composer's great-aunt, who had taught him to play the piano more than thirty years earlier. It is a serious work, in which the main melodic material is sustained by the cello over a virtuoso piano accompaniment. Fauré called it the only cello sonata from any country to be of any importance. The Second (1905) is in four movements, and has the unusual feature of a theme and variations as its scherzo.|$|E
5|$|Random, {{isolated}} cirrus do {{not have}} any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of an approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance. This <b>signals</b> <b>a</b> change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a cirrus castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{operator}} interface {{provides a means}} for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process control signal. The {{operator interface}} often includes an alphanumeric display and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control <b>signals.</b> <b>A</b> serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E

5|$|To be specific, MS {{involves}} {{the loss of}} oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for creating and maintaining a fatty layer—known as the myelin sheath—which helps the neurons carry electrical signals (action potentials). This results in a thinning or complete loss of myelin and, as the disease advances, {{the breakdown of the}} axons of neurons. When the myelin is lost, a neuron can no longer effectively conduct electrical <b>signals.</b> <b>A</b> repair process, called remyelination, takes place in early phases of the disease, but the oligodendrocytes are unable to completely rebuild the cell's myelin sheath. Repeated attacks lead to successively less effective remyelinations, until a scar-like plaque is built up around the damaged axons. These scars are the origin of the symptoms and during an attack magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often shows more than ten new plaques. This could indicate {{that there are a number}} of lesions below which the brain is capable of repairing itself without producing noticeable consequences. Another process involved in the creation of lesions is an abnormal increase in the number of astrocytes due to the destruction of nearby neurons. A number of lesion patterns have been described.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Noul, {{known as}} Typhoon Dodong within the country, entered the Philippine area of Responsibility on May7. In {{response}} to the storm, PAGASA raised warning signal 4, the highest level, for northeastern Cagayan {{as well as the}} offshore Batanes and Babuyan Islands. Neighboring provinces had lower warning <b>signals.</b> <b>A</b> total of 3,803people evacuated their homes in Cagayan and Isabela to 27storm shelters; families returned home by late on May10 after the storm moved ashore without causing much damage. Flights and ferry routes were canceled, stranding 10,000people. The Philippine Army deployed 18soldiers to assist in storm preparations, utilizing boats and helicopters. Fishermen were advised not to go out to sea east of Luzon. People were also evacuated from the vicinity of Mount Bulusan after rains from Noul threatened to cause lahars and mudslides from ash of a recent eruption. They were allowed to return after Noul recurved to the north and the threat did not materialize. Two people in Cagayan died due to electrocution while attempting to fix their roofs ahead of the storm.|$|E
