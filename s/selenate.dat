5|$|Certain solids are {{selenium}}-rich, and selenium can be bioconcentrated by some plants. In soils, selenium {{most often}} occurs in soluble forms such as <b>selenate</b> (analogous to sulfate), which are leached into rivers very easily by runoff. Ocean water contains {{significant amounts of}} selenium.|$|E
5|$|Selenium occurs {{naturally}} {{in a number}} of inorganic forms, including selenide, <b>selenate,</b> and selenite, but these minerals are rare. The common mineral selenite is not a selenium mineral, and contains no selenite ion, but is rather a type of gypsum (calcium sulfate hydrate) named like selenium for the moon well before the discovery of selenium. Selenium is most commonly found as an impurity, replacing {{a small part of the}} sulfur in sulfide ores of many metals.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{commercial}} use of Se, accounting for about 50% of consumption, {{is for the}} production of glass. Se compounds confer a red color to glass. This color cancels out the green or yellow tints that arise from iron impurities typical for most glass. For this purpose, various selenite and <b>selenate</b> salts are added. For other applications, a red color may be desired, produced by mixtures of CdSe and CdS.|$|E

5|$|Selenium {{is found}} in metal sulfide ores, where it {{partially}} replaces the sulfur. Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores, most often during production. Minerals that are pure selenide or <b>selenate</b> compounds are known but rare. The chief commercial uses for selenium today are glassmaking and pigments. Selenium is a semiconductor and is used in photocells. Applications in electronics, once important, have been mostly supplanted by silicon semiconductor devices. Selenium is still used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot.|$|E
25|$|Polonium dioxide is {{prepared}} by reacting elemental polonium with oxygen at 250°C or by thermal decomposition of polonium(IV) hydroxide (PoO(OH)2), polonium disulfate (Po(SO4)2), polonium <b>selenate</b> (Po(SeO4)2), or polonium tetranitrate (Po(NO3)4).|$|E
25|$|The {{bio-availability}} {{of essential}} trace elements (in particular selenium) to potentially lethal lows {{has been shown}} to coincide with, and likely have contributed to, at least three mass extinction events in the oceans, i.e. {{at the end of the}} Ordovician, during the Middle and Late Devonian, and at the end of the Triassic. During periods of low oxygen concentrations very soluble <b>selenate</b> (Se6+) is converted into much less soluble selenide (Se2+), elemental Se and organo-selenium complexes. Bio-availability of selenium during these extinction events dropped to about 1% of the current oceanic concentration, a level that has been proven lethal to many extant organisms.|$|E

5000|$|Selenium {{poisoning}} {{of water}} systems may result whenever new agricultural runoff courses through normally dry, undeveloped lands.

500|$|It {{shows some}} {{cationic}} behaviour. The dioxide dissolves in acid to yield the trihydroxotellurium(IV) Te(OH)3+ ion; the red Te42+ and yellow-orange Te62+ ions form when tellurium is oxidized in fluorosulfuric acid (HSO3F), or liquid sulfur dioxide (SO2), respectively. It can form alloys with aluminium, silver and tin. Tellurium shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by {{the formation of}} oxyanions. Tellurium generally forms compounds {{in which it has}} an oxidation state of −2, +4 or +6. The +4 state is the most stable. Tellurides of composition XxTey are easily formed with most other elements and represent the most common tellurium minerals. Nonstoichiometry is pervasive, especially with transition metals. Many tellurides can be regarded as metallic alloys. The increase in metallic character evident in tellurium, as compared to the lighter chalcogens, is further reflected in the reported formation of various other oxyacid salts, such as a basic <b>selenate</b> 2TeO2·SeO3 [...] and an analogous perchlorate and periodate 2TeO2·HXO4. Tellurium forms a polymeric, amphoteric, glass-forming oxide TeO2. It is a [...] "conditional" [...] glass-forming oxide—it forms a glass with a very small amount of additive. Tellurium has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see organotellurium chemistry).|$|E

50|$|Langbeinite {{structured}} double selenates {{are difficult}} to make, perhaps because <b>selenate</b> ions arranged around the dication leave space for water, so hydrates crystallise from double <b>selenate</b> solutions. For example, when ammonia <b>selenate</b> and cadmium <b>selenate</b> solution is crystallized it forms diammonium dicadmium <b>selenate</b> trihydrate: (NH4)2Cd2(SeO4)3•3H2O and when heated it loses both water and ammonia to form a pyroselenate rather than a langeinite.|$|E

50|$|How sodium <b>selenate</b> {{specifically}} activates ceramide-activated PP2A has {{not been}} well studied. Sodium <b>selenate</b> increases PP2A activity which decreases tau hyperphosphorylation, indicating that CAPPs may be manipulated to affect brain function (Tan et al., 2016). In addition, an increase in PP2A induced by sodium <b>selenate</b> also inhibits the PI3K/AKT pathway, implying that sodium <b>selenate</b> can induce changes in cell morphology and motility (Tsukamoto, Hama, Kogure, & Tsuchiya, 2013). AKT inhibition caused by sodium <b>selenate</b> seems to be physiologically effective at low concentrations (Tsukamoto et al., 2013).|$|E
50|$|The {{oxidation}} {{number of}} the most common chalcogen compounds with positive metals is −2. However the tendency for chalcogens to form compounds in the −2 state decreases towards the heavier chalcogens. Other oxidation numbers, such as −1 in pyrite and peroxide, do occur. The highest formal oxidation number is +6. This oxidation number is found in sulfates, <b>selenates,</b> tellurates, polonates, and their corresponding acids, such as sulfuric acid.|$|R
