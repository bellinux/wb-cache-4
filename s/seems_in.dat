5|$|Mahatma Gandhi's life {{achievement}} stands {{unique in}} political history. He has invented {{a completely new}} and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion. The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more lasting than it <b>seems</b> <b>in</b> our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only {{be the work of}} such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works. We may all be happy and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a role model for the generations to come.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{is shown}} to be {{as he would have}} been high up in the mountains, as a mortal and imperilled man. While this <b>seems</b> <b>in</b> some way demeaning to Napoleon's figure (and {{contrasts}} in the extreme with David's version, which shows Napoleon impervious to the cold, and in a heroic light), Delaroche's artwork was not intended to portray him in a hostile or unbecoming way. Delaroche wanted to depict Napoleon as a credible man, who suffered and underwent human hardship too, on his most daring exploits, and felt that making him appear as he really {{would have been in the}} situation would by no means debase or diminish Napoleon's iconic status or legacy, but rather make him a more admirable person.|$|E

25|$|Afghanistan <b>seems</b> <b>in</b> prehistory, {{as well as}} {{in ancient}} and modern times, to have been {{connected}} by culture and trade with the neighbouring regions. Urban civilization, which includes modern-day Afghanistan, North India, and Pakistan, may have begun as early as 3000 to 2000 BC. Archaeological finds indicate the possible beginnings of the Bronze Age, which would ultimately spread throughout the ancient world from Afghanistan. It is also believed that the region had early trade contacts with Mesopotamia.|$|E
25|$|In Uruguay, {{the first}} {{dedicated}} studies {{show it to}} be not uncommon but patchily distributed {{across the country in}} winter. Notably, it had been underreported in Flores and Paysandú Departments, where it <b>seems</b> <b>in</b> fact to be a regular visitor. In recent years, the first birds were seen in early November, and some stayed until late February. Numbers increase throughout November and peak in December, when flocks of many dozen roam the open lands. But many stay only for a scant few weeks before leaving again.|$|E
25|$|<b>Seems</b> <b>in</b> September 1961 or earlier, {{directly}} before Cuban Crisis (October 1962), Marshal Georgiy Zhukov {{was sure}} in the Soviet victory on Cuba {{and tried to}} mark himself.

25|$|Amarthiel's captain Mordrambor breaks free, killing many Rangers. Soon {{he leads}} an army out of Annúminas, to find Amarthiel's Ring, Narchuil. The player {{attempts}} to find Narchuil before Amarthiel can, searching the ancient ruins of the Trollshaws. After much searching, it turns out Narmeleth, Laerdan's daughter, who originally caused Amarthiel's fall in Fornost, has become possessed by her. But all searching <b>seems</b> <b>in</b> vain, when it is revealed Amarthiel has already found Narchuil. However, Elrond does not fall for her trickery again; he realizes Narchuil is still out there, and Laerdan knows where.|$|E
25|$|Zoo-keeping <b>seems</b> <b>in</b> fact, in the {{surviving}} evidence, {{the most common}} work performed by dwarfs. Royal zookeepers mostly {{took care of the}} king's pets such as hunting dogs, domestic cats and guenons. This may be because these animals were very easy to tame and would not become a danger to the dwarfs. A unique relief from the mastaba of the high official Nyankhnesw (6th Dynasty) shows a dwarf taking a leopard for a walk. In another tomb (that of the high official Nofer, also of the 6th Dynasty), one relief shows a dwarf and his guenon while the little ape pilfers grapes from a fruit basket and plays with his cord. Further Old Kingdom reliefs suggest that guenons literally assisted their keepers: in the tomb of Kaaper a unique relief depicts a dwarf and his guenon, as they both specify the clock for a pair of musicians. In contrast, depictions of dwarfs working themselves as musicians are very rare.|$|E
25|$|A {{newspaper}} typically generates 70–80% of {{its revenue}} from advertising, and the remainder from sales and subscriptions. The portion of the newspaper that is not advertising is called editorial content, editorial matter, or simply editorial, although the last term {{is also used to}} refer specifically to those articles in which the newspaper and its guest writers express their opinions. (This distinction, however, developed over time– early publishers like Girardin (France) and Zang (Austria) did not always distinguish paid items from editorial content.). The business model of having advertising subsidize the cost of printing and distributing newspapers (and, it is always hoped, the making of a profit) rather than having subscribers cover the full cost was first done, it <b>seems,</b> <b>in</b> 1833 by The Sun, a daily paper that was published in New York City. Rather than charging 6 cents per copy, the price of a typical New York daily at the time, they charged 1-cent, and depended on advertising to make up the difference.|$|E

25|$|In 1714, {{he moved}} {{to work at the}} new theatre at Lincoln's Inn Fields, managed by {{entrepreneur}} John Rich. Remaining there for most of his career, he returned to his English repertoire and a new form, the musical Afterpiece. These lightweight works were often comic, and in 1716 Leveridge produced his own afterpiece, Pyramus and Thisbe. For this comic parody of Italian opera, he wrote the music, adapting the words from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, and sang the role of Pyramus. He was apparently absent from the stage around 1720–24, during which time he was occupied with the coffee house in Tavistock Street near Covent Garden, at the sign of 'The Harlequin and Pierot', which he held by lease from 1714 to 1736. However Rich drew him back, and Leveridge scored a success in 1726 in Apollo and Daphne with Silenus's song Tho' envious old age <b>seems</b> <b>in</b> part to impair me, composed by Johann Ernst Galliard. From that time forth he became the leading bass at Lincoln's Inn Fields and then at Covent Garden.|$|E
25|$|While {{deregulation}} allowed Continental {{to expand}} into new profitable areas, it hurt the company's existing business as consumers were {{for the first time}} able to choose lower fares over Continental's better service. In 1978 Continental explored the possibility of a merger with Western Airlines, which held a nearby headquarters and similar fleet. The route systems would have been complementary, with little overlap; although they both served the Western states, Continental had strength in Hawaii, southern-tier and the Great Plains states; Western's strengths were in the California intrastate market, Alaska, Mexico, and the Intermountain West. Both airlines served the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountain states, but along different routes from Los Angeles, Denver, San Francisco, Seattle and Phoenix. The merger did not take place. Unlike some airlines (notably Braniff whose expansion was so rapid and unsustainable that the additional costs made investment recovery impossible, and the carrier was forced into bankruptcy and liquidation), Continental's expansion after passage of the Airline Deregulation Act <b>seems,</b> <b>in</b> retrospect, to have been appropriate. The markets that were added were almost all profitable, absorbing some of the hits to its existing markets and helping it in difficult times between 1982 and 1994.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 TCB, a band {{based in}} the Washington area, created a spinoff sound from go-go called bounce beat. Bounce beat is a heavier version of its {{ancestor}} that relies on timbales, drums, keyboards and bass to form its signature sound. At a time when bands like Backyard, UnCalled 4, and Raw Image were moving the genre toward a more driving sound by using a more forceful “breakdown” beat, bounce beat <b>seems,</b> <b>in</b> retrospect, like a natural progression. Still, the music was initially dismissed by all but a core of believers. It took fans time to realize TCB’s innovation wasn’t a rejection of “traditional” go-go, but a shift. Instead of paying homage to the genre’s early greats by copying their style, bounce beat built on a strong foundation and showed that the music still had more ideas to explore, limited only by percussive innovation and imagination. Fans of bounce beat, like the sound itself, tend to be much younger than the traditional go-go crowd. The rototom-dependent subgenre was initially maligned—some called it “noise,” others argued that it wasn’t go-go at all. Criticism of bounce beat was similar to what was said about the trap rap bubbling in other cities around the same time: It was blasted for its sometimes suggestive lyrics, its thwacking beat, its tempos that vacillated between syrupy and frenetic. But over time, bounce beat made inroads.|$|E

25|$|Poirot observes {{his fellow}} {{passengers}} in the funicular. There is a friendly American tourist called Mr Schwartz, a beautiful but melancholy woman, a distinguished-looking man {{reading a book}} in German and three criminal types playing cards. Arriving at the hotel, they find it somewhat in chaos as it is only just opening {{at the start of}} the season. To Poirot, the hotel manager <b>seems</b> <b>in</b> too much of a nervous panic; the only efficient person is Gustave, the waiter. Talking to the manager and then to Schwartz again, Poirot learns that the beautiful woman is a Madame Grandier, who comes each year on the anniversary of her husband's death in the area, and that the distinguished-looking man is Dr Lutz, a Jewish refugee from the Nazis in Vienna. Poirot introduces himself to Schwartz as Monsieur Poirier, a silk merchant from Lyon. The next morning, when delivering coffee to his room, Gustave tells Poirot that in fact he is M. Drouet, a police inspector. They are now cut off in the hotel as the funicular has been damaged during the night, probably by sabotage. Poirot and Gustave discuss who Marrascaud could be among the guests and staff, which includes Jacques, the cook's husband. Poirot is intrigued as to why a rendezvous has been arranged in such an isolated place.|$|E
500|$|The dove of the Holy Spirit hovers {{inside a}} rainbow-hued {{circle of light}} {{directly}} above the Virgin's head. Its placement and size is unusual for art of the period. It is unlike anything found in van der Weyden, and never repeated in Memling's work, but reminiscent of van Eyck's dove in the Ghent Altarpiece's [...] Annunciation panel. Its shape is found in medallions hung above beds at that time, and thus <b>seems</b> <b>in</b> keeping with the domestic interior.|$|E
500|$|Writing in 2011, Jörg Muth {{concluded}} that [...] "At Fort Leavenworth, school solutions {{were always the}} norm.

It <b>seems</b> <b>in</b> general {{not to have been}} a good idea to challenge the instructors at Leavenworth in any way if an officer student wanted to leave the school with a respectable grade." [...] While the education system [...] undoubtedly failed in some key areas, it did create a body of competent division and corps commanders.|$|E

500|$|In an {{overview}} of the songs in 1973, the musical scholar Yvonne Gouverné said, [...] "With Poulenc, the melodic line matches the text so well that it <b>seems</b> <b>in</b> some way to complete it, thanks to the gift which the music has for penetrating the very essence of a given poem; nobody has better crafted a phrase than Poulenc, highlighting the colour of the words." [...] Among the lighter pieces, one of the composer's most popular songs is a setting of Les Chemins de l'amour for Jean Anouilh's 1940 play as a Parisian waltz; by contrast his [...] "monologue" [...] "La Dame de Monte Carlo", (1961) a depiction of an elderly woman addicted to gambling, shows the composer's painful understanding of the horrors of depression.|$|E
500|$|Wheels incur {{mechanical}} and other disadvantages in certain environments and situations that {{would represent a}} decreased fitness when compared with limbed locomotion. These disadvantages suggest that, even barring the biological constraints discussed above, the absence of wheels in multicellular life {{may not be the}} [...] "missed opportunity" [...] of biology that it first <b>seems.</b> <b>In</b> fact, given the mechanical disadvantages and restricted usefulness of wheels when compared with limbs, the central question can be reversed: not [...] "Why does nature not produce wheels?", but rather, [...] "Why do human vehicles not make more use of limbs?" [...] The use of wheels rather than limbs in many engineered vehicles can likely be attributed to the complexity of design required to construct and control limbs, rather than to a consistent functional advantage of wheels over limbs.|$|E
500|$|This debate <b>seems</b> <b>in</b> {{any case}} to {{have raised the}} composer's profile, leading to reprints of his earlier books of madrigals. Some of his madrigals were {{published}} in Copenhagen in 1605 and 1606, and the poet Tommaso Stigliani published a eulogy of him in his 1605 poem [...] "O sirene de' fiumi". The composer of madrigal comedies and theorist Adriano Banchieri wrote in 1609: [...] "I must not neglect to mention the most noble of composers, Monteverdi... his expressive qualities are truly deserving of the highest commendation, and we find in them countless examples of matchless declamation... enhanced by comparable harmonies." [...] The modern music historian Massimo Ossi has placed the Artusi issue {{in the context of}} Monteverdi's artistic development: [...] "If the controversy seems to define Monteverdi's historical position, it also seems to have been about stylistic developments that by 1600 Monteverdi had already outgrown".|$|E
