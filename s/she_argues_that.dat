5|$|According to Susan Brownmiller, mass rape {{during wartime}} {{is not a}} new phenomenon. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> what was unique to the Bangladesh Liberation War was that the {{international}} community, for the first time, recognised that systematic rape {{could be used as a}} weapon to terrorise the people.|$|E
5|$|At a New Year's Eve {{party that}} year, Sally feels alone without Harry by her side. Harry spends New Year's alone, {{walking around the}} city. As Sally decides to leave the party early, Harry appears and {{declares}} his love for her. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> {{the only reason he}} is there is because he is lonely, but he lists the many things he realized he loves about her. They kiss and marry three months later.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{writes that}} Oprah Winfrey's {{promotion}} of Night {{came at a}} difficult time for the genre of memoir, after a previous book-club author, James Frey, {{was found to have}} fabricated parts of his autobiography, A Million Little Pieces (2003). <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> Winfrey's choice of Night may have been intended to restore the book club's credibility. Night has a useful lesson to teach, Franklin writes, about the complexities of memoir and memory.|$|E
5000|$|<b>She</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{it should}} be legally {{possible}} to confine children who were [...] "feeble-minded" [...] and the Mental Deficiency Act 1913 and the Elementary Education Act 1914 enabled this to happen. <b>She</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{the only way to}} remove [...] "this evil" [...] was by preventing it. By 1910 <b>she</b> was <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> the worst danger was not the worst, but the mild cases of feeble-mindedness. She foresaw that these people could hide their problems and by using this device they could transmit their problems to the children of society.|$|R
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the Letters of Junius {{were written}} by {{political}} philosopher Jean-Louis de Lolme.|$|R
5000|$|Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860-1935) was an American feminist, sociologist, novelist, {{writer and}} social reformer. Her short story [...] "The Yellow Wallpaper" [...] became a bestseller. The {{story is about}} a woman who suffers from mental illness after three months of being closeted in a room by her husband. <b>She</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the {{domestic}} environment oppressed women through the patriarchal beliefs upheld by society. Gilman <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> women's contributions to civilization, throughout history, have been halted because of an androcentric culture. <b>She</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> women were the underdeveloped half of humanity. She believed economic independence would bring freedom and equality for women.|$|R
5|$|From {{this model}} of Kantian ethics, O'Neill begins to develop a theory of justice. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> the {{rejection}} of certain principles, such as deception and coercion, provides {{a starting point for}} basic conceptions of justice, which she argues are more determinate for human beings that the more abstract principles of equality or liberty. Nevertheless, she concedes that these principles may seem to be excessively demanding: there are many actions and institutions that do rely on non-universalisable principles, such as injury.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer (2000), on {{the other}} hand, reacts against this {{commonly}} held view and comments {{that the vast majority}} of the runestones were raised in memory of people who are not reported to have died abroad. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> few men who went abroad were honoured with memorials and the reason is that the runestones were mainly raised because of concerns at home, such as inheritance issues. Such concerns would have arisen when a family knew that a relative would not return from abroad.|$|E
5|$|When the Seanchan {{attack the}} White Tower, its {{fractured}} state prevents an effective defense. Many Aes Sedai are captured or killed until Egwene, leading {{a group of}} novices, succeeds in driving them off. Siuan Sanche, Gawyn Trakand, and Gareth Bryne mount a rescue of Egwene. They find her so exhausted that she cannot protest when they extract her against her orders. After awakening in the camp, <b>she</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> they may have ruined her chances to gain credit in the Tower for {{the defeat of the}} Seanchan.|$|E
50|$|The woman {{appealed the}} {{decision}} of the Delhi High Court to the Supreme Court of India, where <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> there were three reasons for not naming the father: she did not wish to disclose his identity as there was a risk that he would deny paternity as he was already married; she feared that this would affect her child. Secondly, such a revelation might have repercussions on his family considering his marital status. Thirdly, <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> her fundamental right to privacy would be violated if she was compelled to disclose the father's name.|$|R
50|$|Women like Ann, {{her sister}} and Serena Lake made up 30% of the Bible Christians preachers, but despite this Ann and her sister {{attracted}} interest because they were women. Ann wasconfident and argued theological points with her movement's founder William O'Bryan when she {{met him at the}} group's first conference at Launceston in Cornwall, in 17 August 1819. <b>She</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Christians could find instantaneous redemption despite the prevailing view that this was gradually earned. Moreover, <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> believers could be guided directly by God - which undermined the Church's hierarchy including O'Bryan.|$|R
50|$|Collange is {{the author}} of many books. In her first book, Madame et le management, {{published}} in 1969, <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> women should run their households like a business.|$|R
5|$|In 2008 Clinton, a Senator and {{candidate}} for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, became the first American woman to win a presidential primary. Traister discusses Clinton's political campaign, which did not focus on her gender, and the misogynistic reactions she received from the media and political opponents. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> the Democratic Party's lack of response to the sexism of Clinton's opponents led {{a large number of}} liberal female voters to abandon the party, and blames Mark Penn for advising Clinton not to advertise herself as a feminist. Although she originally supported John Edwards' candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, she became a strong supporter of Clinton.|$|E
5|$|In {{his paper}} The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories, philosopher Michael Stocker {{challenges}} Kantian ethics (and all modern ethical theories) {{by arguing that}} actions from duty lack certain moral value. He gives the example of Smith, who visits his friend in hospital out of duty, rather than because of the friendship; he argues that this visit seems morally lacking because it is motivated by the wrong thing. Marcia Baron has attempted to defend Kantian ethics on this point. After presenting {{a number of reasons}} that we might find acting out of duty objectionable, <b>she</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> these problems only arise when people misconstrue what their duty is. Acting out of duty is not intrinsically wrong, but immoral consequences can occur when people misunderstand what they are duty-bound to do. Duty need not be seen as cold and impersonal: one may have a duty to cultivate their character or improve their personal relationships. Baron further argues that duty should be construed as a secondary motive—that is, a motive that regulates and sets conditions on what may be done, rather than prompt specific actions. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that,</b> seen this way, duty neither reveals a deficiency in one's natural inclinations to act, nor undermines the motives and feelings that are essential to friendship. For Baron, being governed by duty does not mean that duty is always the primary motivation to act; rather, it entails that considerations of duty are always action-guiding. A responsible moral agent should take an interest in moral questions, such as questions of character. These should guide moral agents to act from duty.|$|E
5|$|Palmer {{does not}} {{explicitly}} connect Environmental Ethics and Process Thought to Animal Ethics in Context, her second monograph; the latter does, however, address environmental ethics, {{insofar as it}} offers an attempt to bridge environmental ethics and animal ethics. In contrast to more typical approaches to animal ethics which focus on the ethics of harming animals, Palmer asks, in Animal Ethics in Context, about the ethics of aiding animals, {{with a focus on}} the distinction between wild and domestic animals. She follows mainstream animal ethics approaches in arguing that humans have a prima facie duty not to harm any animal. However, when it comes to aiding animals, <b>she</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> human obligations differ depending on the context.|$|E
50|$|Acting Minister of Justice Olena Lukash {{accused the}} {{opposition}} of violating agreements and demanded an immediate end to violence. <b>She</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the escalation was the fault of extremists.|$|R
50|$|Syrkin's first book, Your School, Your Children, {{published}} in 1944, was an influential {{study of the}} American school system, in which <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> schools should actively foster democratic values.|$|R
50|$|The related {{process of}} symbiogenesis or endosymbiosis was {{proposed}} by Lynn Margulis in 1967. <b>She</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the internal symbiosis of bacteria-like organisms had formed organelles like chloroplasts and mitochondria. She proposed {{that this had}} created the eukaryotes, and thus driven the expansion of life on Earth. <b>She</b> had <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> this process of symbiotic collaboration had run alongside the classical Darwinian cycle of mutation, natural selection and adaptation.|$|R
5|$|Some {{branches}} of feminism closely track the political leanings {{of the larger}} society, such as liberalism and conservatism, or focus on the environment. Liberal feminism seeks individualistic equality {{of men and women}} through political and legal reform without altering the structure of society. Catherine Rottenberg has argued that the neoliberal shirt in Liberal feminism has led to that form of feminism being individualized rather than collectivized and becoming detached from social inequality. Due to this <b>she</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> Liberal Feminism cannot offer any sustained analysis of the structures of male dominance, power, or privilege.|$|E
5|$|After Boisselier {{announced}} that {{no evidence of}} the cloning would be provided, journalists became very skeptical of her story. While discussing Boisselier's management of Clonaid, Palmer notes {{that it is impossible}} to know why she stated that a clone was produced but then refused to provide evidence. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> her refusal to provide evidence may have been because she organized a hoax, did not wish to publicize the birth of an unhealthy child, or was taken advantage of by a scientist she had hired. American science journalist Steven S. Hall criticized the media for their coverage of Clonaid, believe that they were inarticulately represented as a credible group. He speculates that the coverage of Boisselier and other cloning adherents galvanized sentiment against cloning, leading to its banning in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists' work on {{globalization}} is diverse and multifaceted. But {{much of it}} is tied together through detailed and nuanced studies {{of the ways in which}} globalization affects women in particular and how these effects relate to socially just outcomes. Often country case studies are used for these data. Some feminist economists focus on policies involving the development of globalization. For example, Lourdes Benería argues that economic development in the Global South depends in large part on improved reproductive rights, gender equitable laws on ownership and inheritance, and policies that are sensitive to the proportion of women in the informal economy. Additionally, Nalia Kabeer discusses the impacts of a social clause that would enforce global labor standards through international trade agreements, drawing on fieldwork from Bangladesh. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> although these jobs may appear exploitative, for many workers in those areas they present opportunities and ways to avoid more exploitative situations in the informal economy.|$|E
60|$|The Prime Minister, she observed, {{was still}} busy on the shore, and, from his {{frequently}} stooping {{to pick up}} something, <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the affairs of State in that quarter were prospering.|$|R
50|$|After her marriage, in {{the early}} 1910s, Sazonova began {{publishing}} articles on Russian puppet theater and critiques of ballet and ballet history in the magazine, Apollo (Аполлон), challenging theories that they originated as art form of elites. Instead, <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the roots were in festivals and folk culture. In 1915, she wrote an analysis of Alexander Ostrovsky's work for the Imperial Theater Yearbook in which <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> his plays could not be evaluated {{on the basis of}} the words alone, but that one must look for the symbolism behind the words to find the struggle for the human soul.|$|R
5000|$|She was {{especially}} famous for her monograph Before European Hegemony: The World System A.D. 1250-1350 where <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> a pre-modern world system extending across Eurasia {{existed in the}} 13th Century, prior {{to the formation of}} the modern world-system identified by Immanuel Wallerstein. In addition, <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "rise of the West," [...] beginning with the intrusion of armed Portuguese ships into the relatively peaceful trade networks of the Indian Ocean in the 16th century, was not a result of features internal to Europe, but was made possible by a collapse in the previous world system.|$|R
5|$|Often {{categorized}} as a rationalist philosopher, Wollstonecraft demonstrates {{her commitment to}} and appreciation of feeling in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> subjective experiences, such as the transcendent emotions prompted by the sublime and the beautiful, possess a value equal to the objective truths discovered through reason. In Wollstonecraft's earlier works, reason was paramount, because it allowed access to universal truths. In Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, however, reason serves {{as a tool for}} reflection, mediating between the sensual experiences of the world and an abstract notion of truth (not necessarily universal truth). Maturation is not only the acquisition of reason—the view Wollstonecraft had adopted in Original Stories from Real Life (1788)—but also an understanding of when and how to trust one's emotions.|$|E
5|$|Process ethics, Palmer argues, {{is closer}} to individualist consequentialism than individualist deontological {{environmental}} ethics. In considering collectivist environmental ethics, Palmer asks how process thinkers could approach natural collectives, such as ecosystems. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> Whitehead could view them as single entities with a good of their own, while Hartshorne could not. The primary difference between process ethics and collectivist environmental ethics, however, is that the former has a theological basis. The advocates of deep ecology have previously sought support from the views of Whitehead; two affinities are the shared holism and a shared concern with {{the extension of the}} self, but Palmer finds that the views of Whitehead and the views of the deep ecology advocate Arne Næss differ in these areas.|$|E
5|$|She {{explains}} the neurological basis for reasoning and cognition in the brain, and brings the point across that the self itself is changeable. She describes the physiology behind neurological pathways which include webs of neurons containing dendrites, axons, and synapses; and explains that certain brains with more rigid pathways {{will be less}} susceptible to new information or creative stimuli. Taylor utilizes neurological science to show that brainwashed individuals have more rigid pathways, and that rigidity can make it unlikely that the individual will rethink situations or be able to later reorganize these pathways. She explains that repetition {{is an integral part}} of brainwashing techniques because connections between neurons become stronger when exposed to incoming signals of frequency and intensity. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> people in their teenage years and early twenties are more susceptible to persuasion. Taylor explains that brain activity in the temporal lobe, the region responsible for artistic creativity, also causes spiritual experiences in a process known as lability.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, Aoki, {{alongside}} several women's rights groups, opposed {{a government}} proposal to restrict Japan's abortion law as <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the policy would infringe on a woman's {{right to control}} her body.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, McKenna {{campaigned for}} the United Kingdom {{to leave the}} European Union in the run up to its {{membership}} referendum. <b>She</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the EU is unreformable and criticised its neoliberal policies.|$|R
50|$|Morgan {{resisted}} her mother's {{suggestion that}} {{she have a}} debutante party to celebrate her availability for marriage. <b>She</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should first gain a career. Her parents were supportive of this wish.|$|R
5|$|The {{exact number}} of {{casualties}} is unknown. There are different numbers that each derive from different investigations that used different definitions of what a victim in this case should be. Therefore, the numbers are hardly comparable. On top of that, some results are published infrequently or investigations were ceased with a provisional number. There is also a publicly held controversy between two groups regarding the number of victims. The opponents are the Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August and the ZZF. The former's numbers are higher, as they include, according to ZZF's Hans-Hermann Hertle, victims with an unclear or unsure connection to the border regime. After the ZZF published its interim results in August 2006, Alexandra Hildebrandt of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft has accused them of withholding numbers to invoke a more positive picture of East Germany. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> the ZZF project was funded {{by a coalition of}} social democrats and leftists.|$|E
25|$|In Excitable Speech, Butler {{surveys the}} {{problems}} of hate speech and censorship. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> censorship is difficult to evaluate, and {{that in some cases}} it may be useful or even necessary, while in others it may be worse than tolerance.|$|E
25|$|Carolyn Eastman {{also finds}} that pirates were {{represented}} as hypermasculine characters from the 18th century forward, {{and she also}} notes that they were depicted as sexual transgressors. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> this imagery of piracy appealed to elite men, who enjoyed the thought of an alternate masculinity without the restraint required {{of men in the}} upper classes.|$|E
5000|$|Beast and Man was an {{examination}} {{of human nature and}} a reaction against the reductionism of sociobiology, and the relativism and behaviorism she saw as prevalent in much of social science. <b>She</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> human beings are more similar to animals than many social scientists then acknowledged, while animals are in many ways more sophisticated than was often accepted. She criticised existentialists who <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{there was no such thing}} as human nature and writers such as Desmond Morris who <b>she</b> understood as <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> human nature was [...] "brutal and nasty". Instead, <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> human beings and their relationship with animals could be better understood by using the qualitative methods of ethology and comparative psychology, and that this approach showed that [...] "we do have a nature and it's much more in the middle.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, Farrell was {{the author}} of a paper in which <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> sending American jobs {{overseas}} might be [...] "as beneficial to the U.S. as to the destination country, probably more so." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bernstein {{wrote that}} the book overall is [...] "a {{thoroughly}} researched study". <b>She</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the introduction [...] "is somewhat dense and confusing and would have benefited from further editing.." [...] <b>She</b> also <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the book should have further supported its conclusions about and re-examine {{the role of the}} Los Angeles Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and the Los Angeles Jewish community, and she considered the idea of the book exploring the Latino population.|$|R
