5|$|The plural form of {{the common}} name {{narcissus}} has caused some confusion. British English sources such as the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary give two alternate forms, narcissi and narcissuses. In contrast, in American English the Merriam-Webster Dictionary provides for a third form, narcissus, used for both singular and plural. The Oxford dictionaries only list this third form under American English, although the Cambridge Dictionary allows of all three in the same order. However, Garner's Modern American Usage states that narcissi is the commonest form, narcissus being excessively <b>sibilant.</b> For similar reasons, Fowler prefers narcissi in British English usage. Neither support narcissus as a plural form. Common names such as narcissus do not capitalise the first letter {{in contrast to the}} person of that name and the Latin genus name.|$|E
25|$|As {{an initial}} letter in Classical Greek it always carried the rough {{breathing}} (equivalent to h) {{as reflected in}} the many Greek-derived English words, such as those that begin with hyper- and hypo-. This rough breathing was derived from an older pronunciation that used a <b>sibilant</b> instead; this <b>sibilant</b> was not lost in Latin, giving rise to such cognates as super- (for hyper-) and sub- (for hypo-).|$|E
25|$|In {{the cases}} of the three {{historical}} <b>sibilant</b> letters below, the correspondence between Phoenician and Ancient Greek is less clear, with apparent mismatches both in letter names and sound values. The early history of these letters (and the fourth <b>sibilant</b> letter, obsolete san) has {{been a matter of}} some debate. Here too, the changes in the pronunciation of the letter names between Ancient and Modern Greek are regular.|$|E

25|$|If the {{singular}} possessive is difficult or awkward to pronounce with an added <b>sibilant,</b> {{do not add}} an extra s; these exceptions are supported by The Guardian, Yahoo! Style Guide, and The American Heritage Book of English Usage. Such sources permit possessive singulars like these: Socrates’ later suggestion; or Achilles’ heel if {{that is how the}} pronunciation is intended.|$|E
25|$|Many {{respected}} authorities {{recommend that}} practically all singular nouns, including those {{ending with a}} <b>sibilant</b> sound, have possessive forms with an extra s after the apostrophe so that the spelling reflects the underlying pronunciation. Examples include Oxford University Press, the Modern Language Association, the BBC and The Economist. Such authorities demand possessive singulars like these: Senator Jones’s umbrella; Tony Adams’s friend.|$|E
25|$|Extending this {{approach}} to cover the Samoyedic languages suggests affinity with Ugric, resulting in the aforementioned East Uralic grouping, as it also shares the same <b>sibilant</b> developments. A further non-trivial Ugric-Samoyedic isogloss is the reduction *k, *x, *w > ɣ when before *i, and after a vowel (cf. *k > ɣ above), or adjacent to *t, *s, *š, or *ś.|$|E

25|$|Any {{consonant}} except h may close a syllable, though coda ĝ and ĵ {{are rare}} in monomorphemes (they contrast in aĝ’ 'age' vs. aĵ’ 'thing'). Within a morpheme, {{there may be}} a maximum of four sequential consonants, as for example in instruas ('teaches'), dekstren ('to the right'). Long clusters generally include a <b>sibilant</b> such as s or one of the liquids l or r.|$|E
25|$|Scripts may {{transcribe}} languages at {{the level}} of morphemes (logographic scripts like Hanja), of syllables (syllabaries like kana), or of segments (alphabetic scripts like the Latin script used to write English and many other languages). Hangul goes one step further in some cases, using distinct strokes to indicate distinctive features such as place of articulation (labial, coronal, velar, or glottal) and manner of articulation (plosive, nasal, <b>sibilant,</b> aspiration) for consonants, and iotation (a preceding i-sound), harmonic class, and i-mutation for vowels.|$|E
25|$|The lateral cut NAB curve {{was remarkably}} similar to the NBC Orthacoustic curve that evolved from {{practices}} within the National Broadcasting Company since the mid-1930s. Empirically, and not by any formula, it was learned that the bass end of the audio spectrum below 100Hz could be boosted somewhat to override system hum and turntable rumble noises. Likewise at the treble end beginning at 1,000Hz, if audio frequencies were boosted by 16dB at 10,000Hz the delicate <b>sibilant</b> sounds of speech and high overtones of musical instruments could survive the noise level of cellulose acetate, lacquer–aluminum, and vinyl disc media. When the record was played back using a complementary inverse curve, signal-to-noise ratio was improved and the programming sounded more lifelike.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Sibilants</b> are {{a type of}} {{fricative}} {{where the}} airflow is guided by a groove in the tongue toward the teeth, creating a high-pitched and very distinctive sound. These {{are by far the}} most common fricatives.

25|$|Cearense or Costa norte — is a dialect spoken {{more sharply}} in the states of Ceará and Piauí. The variant of Ceará {{includes}} fairly distinctive traits it shares with the one spoken in Piauí, though, such as distinctive regional phonology and vocabulary (for example, a debuccalization process stronger than that of Portuguese, a different system of the vowel harmony that spans Brazil from fluminense and mineiro to amazofonia but is especially prevalent in nordestino, a very coherent coda <b>sibilant</b> palatalization as those of Portugal and Rio de Janeiro but allowed in fewer environments than in other accents of nordestino, a greater presence of dental stop palatalization to palato-alveolar in comparison to other accents of nordestino, among others, {{as well as a}} great number of archaic Portuguese words).|$|E
25|$|Besides the quirks the English {{spelling}} {{system has}} inherited from its past, {{there are other}} idiosyncrasies in spelling that make it tricky to learn. English contains, depending on dialect, 24–27 separate consonant phonemes and 13–20 vowels. However, there are only 26 letters in the modern English alphabet, so {{there is not a}} one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds. Many sounds are spelled using different letters or multiple letters, and for those words whose pronunciation is predictable from the spelling, the sounds denoted by the letters depend on the surrounding letters. For example, the digraph th represents two different sounds (the voiced dental fricative and the voiceless dental fricative) (see Pronunciation of English th), and the voiceless alveolar <b>sibilant</b> can be represented by the letters s and c.|$|E
500|$|Consonants {{are those}} sounds that have audible {{friction}} or closure {{at some point}} within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed, commonly at the lips, teeth, alveolar ridge, palate, velum, uvula, or glottis. Each place of articulation produces {{a different set of}} consonant sounds, which are further distinguished by manner of articulation, or the kind of friction, whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called occlusive or stop, or different degrees of aperture creating fricatives and approximants. Consonants can also be either voiced or unvoiced, depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates English [...] in bus (unvoiced <b>sibilant)</b> from [...] in buzz (voiced <b>sibilant).</b>|$|E

'Aids' causes panic and despair and has probably done something to facilitate the spread of the disease." ...|$|E
500|$|Most {{varieties}} {{have relatively}} simple patterns of sound alternation (allophony). [...] In many dialects, the voiced consonants are devoiced in word-final position and in consonant clusters: [...] devoices to a voiceless palato-alveolar <b>sibilant</b> , [...] devoices to a voiceless glottal fricative [...] or to a voiceless labialized velar approximant , and [...] devoices to voiceless alveolar lateral fricative [...] In some dialects, the first consonant {{in almost any}} consonant cluster becomes [...] Some dialects have productive lenition of voiceless consonants into their voiced counterparts between vowels.

500|$|Greenlandic has consonants at {{five points}} of articulation: labial, alveolar, palatal, velar and uvular.
