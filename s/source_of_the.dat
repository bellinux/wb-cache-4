Brock refuses to eat human brains; the symbiote abandons him, and he is locked in an asylum {{under the care of}} the deranged Dr. Paine. Brock escapes to hunt the symbiote, which has gone on a killing spree to obtain brains. He reunites with the symbiote (after finding an alternative <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chemical), but Paine steals the symbiote for himself. Brock frees the symbiote, and again becomes Venom.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 2010 {{concluded}} that the main <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mercury is likely worldwide industry, rather than local sources. As water levels rise and fall, mercury accumulation does as well. About 16 percent of the mercury comes in from rivers, and 84 percent comes from the atmosphere in a non-toxic, inorganic form. The non-toxic mercury is converted into toxic methyl mercury by bacteria which thrive in the more saline water of the North arm affected by the causeway.|$|E

5|$|According {{to local}} geologists, the exact <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spring remains unknown, {{but it is}} {{believed}} that its origin may be southwest of its actual location, possibly at Bukit Timah. Hot springs are formed when underground water comes into contact with hot rock masses. The resulting high pressure causes the water to seep upwards through cracks, forcing itself out of the ground as a spring.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture {{is another}} {{significant}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sava River basin surface water pollution, specifically through livestock manure production.

As a consequence, the Sava River is microbiologically polluted in areas affected by the nutrient pollution. One such part of the river is the lowermost part of its course between Šabac and Belgrade, where acceptable freshwater bacterial counts are exceeded.|$|E

5|$|As a Predator ship reaches Earth's orbit, it fires a beam {{that creates}} a passage through the ice towards the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heat bloom.

The Perseid meteor shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle.
