40|$|A rare but {{distinctive}} {{variant of}} smooth muscle tumours that occurs {{almost exclusively in}} the uterus is characterised {{by the presence of}} plexiform tumourlets, which are composed of clumps and cords of tumour cells that form a discrete pseudoepithelial component. We report on a case of a primary leiomyosarcoma of the proximal humerus, which, in addition to characteristic histological and immunophenotypic features of leiomyosarcoma, contained plexiform tumourlets. Tumour cells in the plexiform component focally expressed muscle/smooth muscle actin, calponin and cytokeratin. Spindle-shaped and epithelioid <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumour</b> cells also expressed the above antigens. This is the first report of a plexiform <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumour</b> arising in bone. This case is remarkable, not only for being only the second reported case of a malignant plexiform <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumour,</b> but also for being one of very few examples of this type of tumour arising outside the uterus; it also is unique in having arisen in a male patient.

40|$|Summary We {{examined}} bcl- 2 {{expression as}} well as p 53 expression and mutation in human uterine <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumours</b> to {{determine the influence of}} bcl- 2 expression on prognosis in patients with uterine leiomyosarcomas. bcl- 2 protein was expressed in nearly all benign <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumours</b> but in only 57 % of leiomyosarcomas. Benign <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumours</b> were usually negative for p 53 protein, but 16 out of 21 (76 %) leiomyosarcomas were positive. A p 53 gene mutation was detected in nine of the 16 leiomyosarcomas that showed p 53 -positive staining. A significant positive correlation was observed between p 53 mutation and p 53 expression, between the number of mitoses and the Ki- 67 labelling index, and between clinical stage and p 53 mutation. A significant negative correlation was observed between bcl- 2 expression and p 53 mutation, and between bcl- 2 expression and p 53 overexpression. Univariate survival analysis revealed that bcl- 2 expression, p 53 mutation and clinical stage (stage 1 vs stages 2 – 4) all showed a significant correlation with prognosis. In a multivariate stepwise regression analysis, positive bcl- 2 expression and stage 1 disease were the independent predictors of a favourable prognosis. Our results suggest that bcl- 2 is frequently expressed in human uterine <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumours,</b> and that its expression may correlate with a favourable prognosis in patients with uterine leiomyosarcoma...|$|R

40|$|The {{distinction}} between benign and malignant <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumours</b> relying on histological {{features such as}} the mitotic index and pleomorphism remains a generally acknowledged difficulty in modern pathology. A cell image processor was therefore used to quantitatively assess the desmin and vimentin immunostain in 39 <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumours</b> which included 26 benign (leiomyomas) and 13 malignant (leiomyosarcomas) cases. The 13 leiomyosarcomas were primary (non-recurrent and non-metastatic). Ploidy level and cell density were also assessed {{on each of these}} 39 tumours by means of the computer-assisted microscopic analysis of 5 -microns thick Feulgen-stained histological sections. The results show that while neither the ploidy level determination nor the quantitative assessment of the vimentin immunostain made it possible to distinguish between leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas, cell density determination and the quantitative assessment of the desmin immunostain enabled such a distinction to be made. Indeed, the leiomyomas exhibited a much higher level of desmin positivity than the leiomyosarcomas, as did diploid tumours as compared to the aneuploid (benign or malignant) ones. Furthermore, the leiomyoma group exhibited a significantly lower mean cell density value than the leiomyosarcoma group.

30|$|The Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) which {{belongs to}} the human {{herpesvirus}} family {{has been associated with}} the development of a number of malignancies including Burkitt’s lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and nasopharyngeal cancers [111].

EBV-associated <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumours</b> (EBV-SMT) may arise in almost any body tissue, having been reported in the colon, liver, adrenal glands, and soft tissues; however, they occur most frequently in the CNS in an extra-axial location. A large case review in AIDS patients showed patients presenting with EBV-SMTs to have modest levels of immunosuppression, with mean CD 4 counts of 60 cells/μL, although in some cases above 200 cells/μL [111]. The time from HIV diagnosis to EBV-SMT presentation ranged from under 1 [*]month to 18 [*]years, with two thirds arising in the first 4 [*]years. Benign leiomyomas and malignant leiomyosarcomas have been reported, and while multifocal lesions are the norm, these appear to arise more often as separate neoplasms rather than metastasising. Treatment is primarily with resection although cases in the literature have been managed with a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) [111]. EBV-SMT should be considered in any immunodeficient patient with dural lesions especially if they are multifocal.|$|R

40|$|AIM [...] To {{study the}} serosal {{reaction}} in gastrectomy specimens with benign chronic peptic ulcers. METHODS [...] Gastrectomy specimens were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and paraffin wax, and examined using immunohistochemical and ultrastructural techniques. RESULTS [...] Nine of the 22 (41 %) cases examined showed reactive hyperplasia of the serosal cells. The cells were predominantly spindle-shaped and were positive on staining with Cam 5. 2, AE 1 / 3 and for vimentin. Eight of nine were also positive for <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> actin and five for desmin. Ultrastructural {{analysis of these}} cells suggests {{that they may be}} myofibroblastic in nature. CONCLUSIONS [...] These results support the concept of "multipotential" subserosal cells which may differentiate into surface serosa or, in the reactive state, modulate the thin cytoskeletal filaments and become more myofibroblastic. Particular care should be taken not to confuse these reactive serosal cells with carcinoma or <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumours</b> in endoscopic biopsy specimens...|$|R

Benign nature and <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> origination of leiomyomas can be easily documented via histological examination. In present study it was tried to examine immunohistochemical profile of leiomyomas with different subtypes. Material and Methods: In this cross-sectional study 64 cases of <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> tumors {{originating from}} uterus were included in study. As a control group 12 cases of conventional leiomyomas were selected. Then estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, p 53 and ki- 67 were assessed. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 16. 0. Results: P 53 and ki- 67 antibody status was diffusely positive in 12 out of 24 cases (50 %) of leiomyosarcomas. Leiomyomas with bizzare nuclei were stained with Ki 67 proliferative marker less than those in obviously malignant cases (P < 0. 001). Estrogen and progesterone receptors had a reverse correlation with tumours malignancy potential. Conclusion: Since p 53 is known as an important inhibitory trigger for proliferative cycle of cells, in current study it was concluded that p 53 inhibitory role decreases as malignancy potential increases, also tumors dependence on steroids via steroid receptors decreases as malignancy potential increases...|$|R

30|$|The {{rarity of}} these tumours has {{prevented}} {{the performance of}} large epidemiological studies to identify risk factors. Assuming an incidence of uterine sarcomas of 0.23  % by applying the ‘inverse rule of 3 ’, a surgeon will need to perform 1304 laparoscopic interventions to observe at least one case of uterine sarcoma with 95  % confidence. Imaging characteristics, tumour markers and other parameters indicating the risk of sarcoma are not available or not specific. In addition, the lack of uniform histologic criteria for diagnosing uterine leiomyosarcoma (ULMS) makes interpretation of the older studies difficult [4]. As the Stanford study [5] {{was the first to}} appreciate that the type of necrosis in a uterine <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumour</b> was of crucial importance, studies that preceded it did not evaluate {{the presence or absence of}} tumour cell necrosis. A leiomyosarcoma usually exhibits diffuse moderate-to-severe atypia, a mitotic count of > 10 MFs/ 10 HPFs and tumour cell necrosis. A tumour with any two of these features is clinically malignant often enough to warrant a diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma [6].|$|E

Expression of six members of the S 100 protein family: S 100 A 1, A 4, A 6, A 7, A 10 and A 11, was found in human uterine leiomyoma and myometrium tissue, but expression of other members was not detected by RT–PCR. Real-time PCR showed that S 100 A 11 expression was significantly increased in leiomyoma compared with myomet-rium. Suppression of S 100 A 11 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) led to apoptosis, and the overexpression of S 100 A 11 inhibited apoptosis in human uterine <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumour</b> cells.

Symptoms usually manifest during the 4 th decade [14]. As fibroids may cause acute pain, patients may present at the emergency department. Acute pain may be caused by the degeneration of a fibroid when it outgrows its blood supply, torsion of a pedunculated fibroid or prolapse of a submucosal fibroid. Red (or haemorrhagic) degeneration is another type of acute fibroid degeneration seen in pregnancy and in patients on the oral contraceptive pill, caused by thrombosis of the venous outflow and resulting in a rapid increase {{in the size of the}} fibroid with acute haemorrhagic infarction. Acute complications of fibroids are rarely seen but may be serious. Acute bleeding into fibroids can lead to hypovolaemic shock and cause the death of the patient [34, 35].|$|R
