40|$|Background: The {{traditional}} {{use of the}} oleo-gum-resin of Commiphora guidottii Chiov. ex. Guid., {{which is}} commonly called <b>scented</b> <b>myrrh,</b> for topical treatment of wound is well documented. The major objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate the essential oil and resin obtained from C. guidottii for their potential wound healing properties. Due to their influence on the wound healing process, the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities of <b>scented</b> <b>myrrh</b> have also been investigated. Methods: Powdered oleo-gum-resin of C. guidottii was steam-distilled to obtain essential oil, and the resin was extracted from the marc with MeOH and filtered. The TLC fingerprint profile of the resin has been recorded by using silica gel GF 254 as stationary phase. The essential oil components were identified and quantified by GC-MS. Ointments prepared from the essential oil (4 % v/w) and the resin (5 % w/w) were used for wound healing activity tests. Toxicity of the formulated ointments was investigated according to Draize skin irritation test. Acute anti-inflammatory effect in mice was evaluated using carrageenan induced mouse hind paw oedema model. Antimicrobial activity tests were carried out using disk diffusion and broth dilution techniques against 21 pathogenic bacterial and 4 fungal strains. Results: Ointment formulations of both the oil and resin were found to be non-irritant at the concentrations used and showed significant (p < 0. 05 - 0. 001) increase in wound contraction rate, shorter epithelization time and higher skin breaking strength as compared to the negative control. Overall, the antibacterial and antifungal activities of the oil and resin were comparable with the standard antibiotics ciprofloxacin and griseofulvin, respectively. Conclusion: The results confirm that <b>scented</b> <b>myrrh</b> possesses genuine wound healing activity supporting the traditional use of the plant...|$|R
