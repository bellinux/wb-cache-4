40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} address recent and ongoing {{controversy}} surrounding <b>Sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>Relationships</b> <b>Education</b> in Scotland. <b>Sex</b> education guidance in Scotland remains ambiguous, sometimes deliberately so, resulting in tensions between ideological positions and social groups {{and as such}} strongly polarised opinions are often voiced expressing the view that <b>Sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>Relationships</b> <b>Education</b> is either too liberal or not liberal enough {{on issues such as}} marriage and homosexuality. We propose that a stronger emphasis on understanding conceptions of the human person and in particular, the role and place (if any) of love <b>and</b> romantic <b>relationships</b> in <b>education</b> as a potential path to relieving tensions surrounding the <b>sex</b> education content <b>and</b> delivery. By addressing the fundamental areas of love we wish to explore the possibility of carving out a space of agreement <b>and</b> consensus in <b>Sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>Relationships</b> <b>Education</b> in Scotland...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the first in-depth ‘home international’ comparison examining England’s and Northern Ireland’s policy processes {{with regard to}} making <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationship(s)</b> <b>education</b> a statutory component of their national curricula for secondary schools. Drawing on policy network analysis, advocacy coalition and political decisionmaking literature more broadly, this study focuses on how policy actors in both regions conceptualise the debate around <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationship(s)</b> <b>education.</b> It extends the ‘values in <b>sex</b> education’ discussion <b>and</b> focuses on the specific values informing policy discussions, {{as well as those}} embedded within/excluded from relevant policy texts, and the centrality of power around who or what groups are influential in shaping policy. Informed by a social constructivist epistemology and utilising a mixed method, case study design, this study’s data include Northern Ireland Assembly and Westminster Parliament Hansard transcripts, relevant legislation and statutory policy texts, and semi-structured interviews with 32 elected representatives, civil servants, third sector representatives, academics and local school practitioners. Employing thematic and content analysis to each text, a framework was created for both the England and Northern Ireland cases to determine how policy actors in both countries approach <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationship(s)</b> <b>education</b> <b>and</b> the values driving policy development arguments. Cross-case comparisons indicate that SRE policy-making in England is primarily made through a closed, ‘top down’ policy strategy with the authoritative power of the ruling government overshadowing the perceived reputational power of those within the larger SRE policy network. Meanwhile Northern Ireland adopts a more open, partnership sharing, ‘ground up’ policy strategy toward RSE with relatively little influence from Members of the Legislative Assembly within the policy-making process. This study’s findings offers a new conceptual framework for understanding the different factors that shape the <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationship(s)</b> <b>education</b> policy-making systems within both countries and provides a tool for possible policy learning in these countries more widely. ...|$|R

50|$|In the United Kingdom, Catholic, Church of England (in England) and Jewish {{schools have}} long been {{supported}} within the state system, with all other schools having a duty to provide compulsory religious education.

State school religious education is non-proselytising and covers a variety of faiths, although the legislation requires it to include more Christian content than other faiths. The Church of Scotland does not have schools, although it does often have a presence in Scottish non-denominational institutions. There is no National Curriculum for Religious Education in England. In England and Wales, the content of the syllabus is agreed on by local education authorities (LEAs), with the ratification of a Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education (SACRE) comprising members of different religious groups, teachers and local councillors.

5000|$|Academies and the Department for Education {{came under}} greater {{scrutiny}} in August 2013, when LGBT activists, in co-ordination with the British Humanist Association (BHA), identified over forty schools whose policies either replicated {{the language of}} Section 28 in their <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>education</b> (SRE) policies or were [...] "unhelpfully vague" [...] on the issue. Several of the schools highlighted by the BHA included the Evelyn Grace Academy chain of faith schools - which opened after the repeal of Section 28, Tasker-Milward V.C.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{findings from}} an in-depth {{case study of}} young people's sexuality and learning about sex. Focus groups and unstructured {{interviews were conducted with}} young women and young men aged 15 - 16 years in a school in the north of England. Analysis focused on disjunctions between reported sexual behaviour in a park and in a bedsitting room, and the content of school <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>education.</b> Tensions between the accounts are considered for their impact on learning about sex, sexual negotiation, subjectivity and inter-generational understanding. Despite some negative experiences in sex education, the young people interviewed desired the affirmation and support of adults, and recommend <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>education</b> as the most appropriate vehicle for providing this. The value added outcomes of participation in the study, including consciousness and awareness raising, and the opportunity for reflection and debate and selves as 'experts', enhanced young people's view that non-judgemental and meaningful advice and guidance are possible in formal learning contexts. Implications for future forms of <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>education</b> are discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|GET REAL ABOUT SEX: The Politics and Practice of Sex Education explores how {{cultural}} {{ideas about}} gender, sexuality and parenthood {{play out in}} the <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>education</b> classroom. It presents new material from a detailed study and analyses the struggle to raise the status of <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>education</b> against academic and market-driven priorities. It locates {{the dynamics of the}} classroom within those of the school and asks: What do the different parties in teaching and learning - both staff and pupils - say about how sex education is and should be taught in the classroom? How do ideas about masculinity, femininity and parenthood operate in the classroom and in policy? What different agendas and professional perspectives are revealed in the views of teachers, PSHE coordinators, school nurses and head-teachers? The complex picture that emerges of forces at work within a single school is, in turn, situated within an analysis of the broader cultural forces at work in contemporary Britain. It considers how young people negotiate intensified pressure on them regarding academic attainment in an increasingly sexualised culture, and it develops a critique of the Achievement Agenda in education policy, contributing another arm to the critique of market rationalities in education. This book analyses the challenges facing the provision of quality <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>education</b> at the classroom level and at the political level, and makes sometimes provocative suggestions for changes at both these levels...|$|E
