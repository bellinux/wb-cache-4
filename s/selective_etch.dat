50|$|In 2012, new dental {{universal}} adhesives are commercialized. The universal adhesives bond to all dental substrates, {{which include}} enamel, dentin, metal, porcelain, ceramic and zirconia, {{with a single}} application. The term “universal” adhesive is not new. In fact, many early bonding agents were named or described as “universal” adhesives, such as XP Bond-Universal Total-etch Adhesive (Dentsply), One-Step-Universal Dental Adhesive (Bisco). However, there is still not a definition of dental “universal adhesive”. It is highly confusing what the term “universal” means. In 2012, the term “universal adhesive” has several definitions which may include: a)Can be used in total-etch, self-etch, and <b>selective</b> <b>etch</b> techniques; b)Can be used with light-cure, self-cure, and dual-cure materials (without the separate activators); c)Can be used for both direct and indirect substrates; d)Can bond to all dental substrates, such as dentin, enamel, metal, ceramic, porcelain, and zirconia. Currently (2012), only two new “universal adhesives” have been commercialized. In November 2011, 3M ESPE released a new ScotchBond Universal. ScotchBond Universal requires a separate self-cure activator or a special amine-free dual-cure cement when use with dual-cure or self-cure materials, unless used with specific cements recommended by the manufacturer, such as RelyX Ultimate. In addition, ScotchBond Universal also contains silane and MDP, enabling it to effectively bond every type of dental restorative material, such as glass ceramics, metal, composite resin, and zirconium oxide. In March 2012, Bisco scientist Dr Liang Chen and his coworkers developed a new All-Bond Universal, which can be use in total-etch, self-etch and <b>selective</b> <b>etch</b> techniques, {{can be used with}} any dual-cure, self-cure and light-cure materials without the need of a separate activator, can be used for both direct and indirect substrates, and can bond with any dental substrates (additional silane or ceramic primer is required when using to bond glass ceramics or cured composite materials as a separate, additional step). However, current Bisco publications only show adhesive data when All-Bond Universal is used with Bisco cements.|$|E

The passive components required to enable high performance consume premium {{space on the}} surface of the printed circuit board. Integrating the resistor function into the laminate substrate frees up the PCB surface area consumed by the discrete component, enabling increased device functionality by the placement of more active components. When the typical 5 to 20 % tolerance of embedded resistors can be allowed, the resistors satisfy the device requirements.

Thin film alloys of nickel and chromium, due to the good thermal stability of the alloy, are trimmed to high accuracy at high speed.

40|$|An {{interfacial}} intermixed Pt-Si layer formed during Pt sputtering at room temperature, and {{a subsequent}} <b>selective</b> <b>etch</b> step {{are found to}} be the keys for formation of continuous and uniform ultrathin PtSi layers. The etching, performed after the metal deposition, removes Pt at very fast rates. The etch rate is slowed when the Pt- Si interfacial layer is reached and an oxide is formed on top of the intermixed Pt-Si layer, which prevents further etching. During this process, a short- range diffusion mechanism is believed to transform the intermixed Pt-Si layer into a 3 nm thick continuous PtSi film. A subsequent annealing results in a more uniform grain size distribution, without changing the other characteristics of the film.
