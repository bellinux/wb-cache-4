Leaf intervenial distance was invariant for C 4 grasses (except for the non-invasive Chrysopogon gryllus) and the C 3 C. epigeios, but changed by 25. 1 % for the C 3 B. inermis.

30|$|More grass {{species were}} {{observed}} during the wet season {{compared to the}} dry season. This was {{because some of the}} ephemerals like S. verticillata were present only during the wet season. Ephemerals are grass species which regenerate immediately after the rains (Verdoodt et al. 2010; Lugusa et al. 2016), emerging where decreaser species have been depleted as a result of heavy grazing and are therefore a sign of poor range condition (Oluwole et al. 2008). Eragrostis spp., for instance, are increaser species, increasing in abundance where there is severe grazing that leads to range degradation (Du Toit 2009). These results corroborate Egeru et al.

The Action programmes entail various means of reducing the risks of the pollution of water by nitrate: (a) struggle against nitrate losses in fields using a range of good agricultural practices, including certain restrictions on the use of fertilisers (quantities, spreading periods, soil conditions, etc.), (b) keeping a balance on each farm between the organic nitrogen produced and <b>spreading</b> <b>capacities</b> on agricultural land, (c) adapting storehouses for livestock effluent to a capacity of 6 months and (d) promoting transfers of livestock effluent between farms in excess balance and farms which still have a way of using it on their land.

40|$|Abstract—Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a {{promising}} framework for evolving the current network architecture, advocating ubiquitous in-network caching to enhance content delivery. Consequently, in CCN, each router has storage space to cache frequently requested content. In this work, {{we focus on}} the cache allocation problem: namely, how to distribute the cache capacity across routers under a constrained total storage budget for the network. We formulate this problem as a content placement problem and obtain the exact optimal solution by a two-step method. Through simulations, we use this algorithm to investigate the factors that affect the optimal cache allocation in CCN, such as the network topology and the popularity of content. We find that a highly heterogeneous topology tends to put most of the capacity over a few central nodes. On the other hand, heterogeneous content popularity has the opposite effect, by <b>spreading</b> <b>capacity</b> across far more nodes. Using our findings, we make observations on how network operators could best deploy CCN caches capacity. I...|$|E

The blocking probability of connections in a network thus protected is compared against the networks blocking probability if protected by a p-Cycle.

40|$|Alphaherpes viruses, such as pseudorabies virus (PRV), undergo {{anterograde}} transport in neuronal axons {{to facilitate}} anterograde spread within hosts. Axonal sorting and anterograde transport of virions {{is dependent on}} the viral membrane protein Us 9, which interacts with the host motor protein Kif 1 A to direct transport. Us 9 -Kif 1 A interactions are necessary but not sufficient for these processes, indicating that additional cofactors or post-translational modifications are needed. In this study, we characterized two conserved serine phosphorylation sites (S 51 and S 53) in the PRV Us 9 protein that are necessary for anterograde spread in vivo. We assessed the subcellular localization of phospho-Us 9 subspecies during infection of neurons and found that the phospho-form is detectable on the majority, but not all, of axonal vesicles containing Us 9 protein. In biochemical assays, phospho-Us 9 was enriched in lipid raft membrane microdomains, though Us 9 phosphorylation did not require prior lipid raft association. During infections of chambered neuronal cultures, we observed only a modest reduction in anterograde <b>spread</b> <b>capacity</b> for diserine mutant Us 9, and no defect for monoserine mutants. Conversely, mutation of the kinase recognition sequence residues adjacent to the phosphorylation sites completely abrogated anterograde spread. In live-cell imaging analyses, anterograde transport of virions was reduced during infection with a recombinant PRV strain expressing GFP-tagged diserine mutant Us 9. Phosphorylation was not required for Us 9 -Kif 1 A interaction, suggesting that Us 9 -Kif 1 A binding is a distinct step from the activation and/or stabilization of the transport complex. Taken together, our findings indicate that, while not essential, Us 9 phosphorylation enhances Us 9 -Kif 1 A-based transport of virions in axons to modulate the overall efficiency of long-distance anterograde spread of infection...|$|R

Acacia senegal, Acacia seyal (AcSey), sugar beet pectin (SBP) in conventional and matured states and two conventional samples of gum Ghatti (GG) were studied in aqueous solutions at pH 4. 5 and 3. 1. Samples were analysed by their Langmuir compression isotherms. At pH 4. 5, the conventional A. senegal (GAc) and A. seyal (AcSeyc) samples exhibited low <b>spreading</b> <b>capacity</b> {{compared with the}} other hydrocolloids. The capacity to spread on the surface was improved by the maturation process applied to A. senegal gums and to SBP, but {{had little effect on}} the A. seyal samples. The elasticity at zero deformation rate was homogenous for the hydrocolloids. Only A. seyal samples showed high resistance to layer compression, probably due to their low specific volume because of their more compact structure. The matured A. senegal gum was hydrophobically fractionated to separate the main components which were studied individually. The arabinogalactan protein (AGP) component dominates the surface behaviour of this hydrocolloid, and it was confirmed that the arabinogalactan (AG) component did not exhibit surface activity. Acidification of the sub-phase to pH 3. 1 improved the spreading and mechanical properties of the layers for all conventional and matured samples, which is in agreement with previous results at n-hexadecane-water interface. However, the GG samples were not affected by pH changes and exhibited similar Langmuir isotherms at both pH values. A. senegal gums were further studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ellipsometry. In aqueous solutions circular particles of about 11 nm in diameter were detected at pH 4. 5 for GAc, whereas matured A. senegal gum (designated as EM 2) showed circular objects of about 25 nm diameter. Aggregated particles were observed in both samples, but their proportion in EM 2 was higher than for GAc. By AFM analysis, the film layer formed by EM 2 samples at the air-water interface (pH 4. 5) at a surface pressure of 28 mN/m was thick (about 3 times the height of the particles). The roughness and larger particle sizes were more evident for EM 2 samples.

The bigger the K value was, the stronger the penetration and <b>spreading</b> <b>capacity</b> was. Moreover, the curing kinetics of the BPF resin was also investigated with dynamic differential scanning calorimetry.

Determining the principle responses of phlebotomine sandflies to climatic changes supports our understanding of future regions that will be threatened by new-establishments of this important group of disease vectors. The aim {{of this paper is to}} combine projected climatic suitability for five Phlebotomus species in Central Europe (Austria, Germany and Switzerland) for different time-periods during the 21 st century with their potential <b>spreading</b> <b>capacity</b> to disperse to climatically suitable areas. We indicate that the Central European climate will develop toward the preferred bioclimatic niche of the species, especially from mid-century onwards. Nevertheless, we also elucidate within this study that sandflies will hardly be able to occupy the whole areas that will provide suitable climatic conditions due to their limited natural dispersal ability. Our approach provides a framework to combine statistical modelling techniques with expert knowledge on species ecology. Indications of future occurrences of disease vectors may help to initiate surveillance systems in specific regions at an early stage of risk exposure. Hence, the threat of the climate-driven spatial extension of disease vectors and consequently of potentially emerging vector-borne diseases can be counteracted...|$|E
40|$|Dune {{plants are}} {{subjected}} to disturbance and environmental stresses, but {{little is known about}} the possible combined effects of such factors on growth and spatial colonization. We investigated how clones of Sporobolus virginicus, a widespread dune species, responded to the independent and interactive effects of breakage of rhizomes, breakage position and burial regime. Horizontal rhizomes were severed at three different internode positions relative to the apex to span the range of damage by disturbance naturally observed or left intact, and apical portions exposed to two burial scenarios (ambient vs. increased frequency) for three months in the field. The performance of both parts of severed rhizomes, the apical portion and the remaining basal portion connected to clone containing four consecutive ramets, was compared with that of equivalent parts in intact rhizomes. Apical portions severed proximal to the third internode did not survive and their removal did not enhance branching on their respective basal portions. Severing the sixth or twelfth internode did not affect survival and rhizome extension of apical portions, but suppressed ramet production and reduced total biomass and specific shoot length. Their removal enhanced branching and ramet production on basal portions and changed the original rhizome growth trajectory. However, the gain in number of ramets in basal portions never compensated for the reduction in ramet number in apical portions. Recurrent burial increased biomass allocation to root tissues. Burial also stimulated rhizome extension only in intact rhizomes, indicating that disturbance interacts with, and counteracts, the positive burial effect. These results suggest that disturbance and recurrent burial in combination reduces the regeneration success and <b>spread</b> <b>capacity</b> of S. virginucus. Since global change leads to increasingly severe or frequent storms, the impact of disturbance and burial on clones could be greater in future and possibly prevent colonization of mobile dunes by the species...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Reverse link {{capacity}} of a direct-sequence codedivision multiple-access (DS-CDMA) system in a multicell environment has been studied recently, and significant capacity improvements due {{to the use of}} beamforming have been observed. However, system performance with beamforming will be affected by several impairments, such as direction of arrival estimation errors, array perturbations, mutual coupling, and signal spatial spreads. In this paper, reverse link performance of CDMA systems with beamforming under these impairments (imperfect beamforming) is investigated. A simplified beamforming model is developed to evaluate the system performance in terms of user capacity, bit-error rates (BER), and outage probabilities. Both signal-to-interference-ratio-based power control and strengthbased power control are considered in this paper.

30|$|No {{significant}} difference in plant diversity, richness, and evenness was observed between seasons. This {{could be due to}} the fact that 18 out of the 22 grass species observed were perennials (Table  1) and had life-spans of more than a season. The four annuals observed (C. pycnothrix, E. tenuifolia, E. fatmensis, and S. verticillata) were not sufficient to produce a {{significant difference}}. Similarly, at least 25 out of the 29 forbs were observed during both dry and wet seasons (Table  2), with the exception of Thunbergia elliotii and Polygala sphenoptera which were not recorded in the wet season and Corchorus olitorius and Becium obovatum which were not recorded in the dry season. The findings could be attributed to the fact that the study area was mainly dominated by S. holstii and T. triandra (Table  1) which are perennial grasses. Most forbs observed were also perennial and survived for more than a season. Pre-dominance of perennial grasses during dry and wet seasons was also observed by Egeru et al.

As a result, cell physiology was hampered concerning collagen I synthesis and <b>spreading</b> <b>capacity.</b> Furthermore, the position-dependent initial cell adhesion strength was declined near the edges. We asked whether these observed cellular effects can be performed only in combination with Ti or occur independently of chemical surface features. In addition, the specific culture conditions, e. g. serum content or influence of gravity, were of interest. Human primary osteoblasts were cultured in Osteoblast Growth Medium with serum containing SupplementMix on pure silicon pillars (5 x 5 x 5 µm) or on samples additionally sputtered with Ti (as reference) or gold. To offer the cells ligands for their adhesion receptors, we coated the pillars with collagen I or alternatively with a plasma polymer layer from allylamine.

However, when 15 μ g laminin per dish was added along with the lowmalignant cells, they then attached and spread on the plastic and collagen-coated dishes. Previous studies have indicated that the highly malignant lines express cell surface antigens that cross-react with laminin while the low-malignant cell lines do not.

AECA allows the government to control the export of defense items, services, and technical data to other nations, and ITAR is the implementation of these controls.

Therefore, organizations or individuals who deviate or violate ITAR export regulations are exposed to the extensive civil and criminal penalties (IIEI 2016).

The epizootiological significance of these findings is discussed, with emphasis on the weak <b>spreading</b> <b>capacity</b> of the ts vaccine strain and the possibility of emergence of recombinant viruses.

40|$|Objective-Platelet {{function}} {{has been}} intensively {{studied in the}} adult organism. However, {{little is known about}} the function and hemostatic capacity of platelets in the developing fetus as suitable in vivo models are lacking. Approach and Results-To examine fetal platelet function in vivo, we generated a fetal thrombosis model and investigated light/dye-induced thrombus formation by intravital microscopy throughout gestation. We observed that significantly less and unstable thrombi were formed at embryonic day (E) 13. 5 compared with E 17. 5. Flow cytometry revealed significantly lower platelet counts in E 13. 5 versus E 17. 5 fetuses versus adult controls. In addition, fetal platelets demonstrated changed activation responses of surface adhesion molecules and reduced P-selectin content and mobilization. Interestingly, we also measured reduced levels of the integrin-activating proteins Kindlin- 3, Talin- 1, and Rap 1 during fetal development. Consistently, fetal platelets demonstrated diminished <b>spreading</b> <b>capacity</b> compared with adults. Transfusion of adult platelets into the fetal circulation led to rapid platelet aggregate formation even in young fetuses. Yet, retrospective data analysis of a neonatal cohort demonstrated no correlation of platelet transfusion with closure of a persistent ductus arteriosus, a process reported to be platelet dependent. Conclusions-Taken together, we demonstrate an ontogenetic regulation of platelet function in vivo with physiologically low platelet numbers and hyporeactivity early during fetal development shedding new light on hemostatic function during fetal life...|$|E
40|$|Synchronous code-division multiple-access (CDMA) {{communication}} with randomly chosen spherical <b>spreading</b> sequences and <b>capacity</b> achieving error correction coding is analyzed. Emphasis {{is put on}} the penalties to be paid by applying single user coding in conjuction with decorrelation as pre-equalization. In contrast to previous work on this topic, the analysis also extends to re-encoded decision feedback structures where an equal rate and and an equal power case are distinguished. The results are nonasymptotic {{in the number of}} users and show that fluctuations of the signal-to-noise ratio due to the random nature of the sequences has no deleterious effect onto capacity for the spherical random sequence model...|$|R
50|$|The hall is {{considered}} {{to have one of}} the best acoustics for classical music in Europe. It was refurbished in 2004 and was widely praised for being completed on time and on budget. The hall's current <b>capacity,</b> <b>spread</b> across the stalls and a smaller balcony, is 545 seats. In 2005, the Wigmore Hall Trust purchased a long lease of 300 years for £3.1m. This both secured the future of the hall and allowed money previously required for rent to be used for further development of its artistic programme. There are two bars and a restaurant on the lower ground floor, below the main hall.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of dynamic channel capacity measurements for a multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system in two populated indoor environments with and without line-of-sight (LoS). The experiment used 4 sending and 4 receiving antennas and 114 sub-carriers at 5 GHz as per draft IEEE 802. 11 n. MIMO-OFDM channel capacity is analysed both with fixed receiver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and fixed transmitter (Tx) power criteria. It is found that fixed SNR capacity increased while fixed Tx power capacity decreased in both environments by the presence of pedestrian. It is also revealed that the <b>spread</b> of the <b>capacity</b> cumulative distribution function (CDF) increased due to the pedestrians in both environments with both criteria...|$|R
