40|$|DURING {{the past}} ten years {{numerous}} fairly complete analyses of the mineral content of whole grains have been made at the Utah Experiment <b>Station.</b> A <b>summary</b> of these results is of considerable interest for a number of reasons: (1) In the case of wheat, oats, and barley they represent the averages of many determinations: Wheat 1755 samples, oats 1205 samples, barley 110 samples, and corn 75 samples. (2) These grains were grown under both irrigated and dry-farm conditions. (3) They were grown on soils having a wide variation in composition. The soils varied from the so-called"alkali-free " to "alkali soils " and from the highly calcareous to those in which calcium was present only in moderate quanti ties. (4) The sulfur of the soil varied greatly. Some of the soils were highly impregnated with gypsum while others contained only small quantities of sulfur. (5) The wheat represents various varieties grown under similar conditions; consequently, we have a crude measure of the effect of irrigation, soil, and variety on the mineral content. (6) The determinations of ash, calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, sulfur, and iron were all made by modern methods of analysis, usually those approved by the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists (6).

40|$|To {{decrease}} auto use {{and encourage}} public transit usage, transit-oriented {{development has been}} growing in importance. However, a few existing {{studies have examined the}} travel modes to transit stations. This research addresses this gap of knowledge by examining multi-level factors, including socio-demographic factors of individuals, socioeconomic characteristics, built environment attributes, and safety factors influencing walking to transit stations in the city of Los Angeles, California. This study primarily relies on travel survey data from the Post-Census Regional Household Travel Survey conducted from 2001 to 2003 by the Southern California Association of Governments. In the first phase, this research uses bivariate linear regression models to examine the disparities of the built environment across the station areas. The results indicate that the street light density and sidewalk completeness are lower in neighborhoods with higher percentages of Blacks or Hispanics. The density of tree coverage is higher in neighborhoods with higher median household income. The second phase of this study employs four binary logistic regression models to predict the odds of walking to transit stations. The results indicate that the distance to transit stations and the availability of transit parking have significant negative impacts on the likelihood of walking to transit stations. Pedestrian amenities, such as street lights, tree shade, and sidewalk completeness increase the odds of walking to stations. Land use mixture is a positive factor for predicting walking to transit stations. The greater diversity of land uses increase the chances of walking to transit <b>stations.</b> In <b>summary,</b> for promotion of walking to transit stations, this study suggests the strategies, such as increasing sidewalk completeness, street light density, street tree density, and land use mixture. Decreasing the parking lots around stations would discourage driving to stations. Meanwhile, more public attention is necessary to improve the pedestrian facilities in the minority or poor neighborhoods...|$|R
40|$|A {{statistical}} modeling {{approach was}} used to estimate the pollution loads in different river system of Fuji River Basin. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Suspended Solids (SS) and Orthophosphate Phosphorus (PO 4 -P) were taken as indicator of pollution. Loadings of BOD, COD, SS and PO 4 -P were estimated in Kikkobashi, Hikawabashi and Omogawabashi sub basins, using a Seven Parameter Log Linear Model (ESTIMATOR) developed by United States of Geological Survey. ESTIMATOR computes nutrient and other constituent loads in rivers based on a daily values for discharge and unit value water quality samples. The fortnightly (semi-monthly) measured values of the water quality parameters of more than 10 years were used to build the concentration and load models for each water quality parameter for each sub basins to predict the daily concentrations and loadings. Of these three stations, the daily discharge in Hikawabashi and Omogawabashi subbasins was not available. Therefore, a TANK model which was calibrated and validated with very good results {{was used to}} estimate the daily discharge for those <b>stations.</b> The statistical <b>summaries</b> of concentration and load models show {{it is capable of}} predicting the loadings from each sub basin.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{wind speed}} and direction summaries {{for a wide}} area of the Southeastern United States (including EPA Region 4) and portions of the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys in a monthly time series format that is further broken down for eight {{hours of the day}} (01 : 00, 04 : 00, 07 : 00, 10 : 00, 13 : 00, 16 : 00, 19 : 00, 22 : 00 EST). The data used for these summaries were obtained from the International <b>Station</b> MeteorologicalClimate <b>Summary</b> (FCCA, 1996), a publicly available source of tabular data from weather stations around the world distributed through the National Climatic Data Center. The advantage of examining the data in the form presented in this report is that it is far easier to examine and understand regional and diurnal weather patterns than would be possible with the tabular data in its original format. The winds presented here can be viewed online in any of three formats through an Internet link. The first format is the traditional wind rose as used in our earlier reports f or 13 stations in the Southeast, c. f., Weber, Buckley, and Parker 2002 and Weber, Buckley, and Kurzeja 2003. The second format is the mode, or most frequent wind direction sector from the wind rose plots (i. e., the longest ''petal'' from the individual station roses). Finally, the third format depicted is the average wind vector. The average wind vector was determined by extracting the wind speed and direction for each of the 16 sectors from a station's wind record and then summing components of these vectors for the month and time of observation. Each station was then plotted on a sequence of maps for the Southeastern U. S. using ArcView software. These maps form a time series in 3 -hour increments showing changes in vector wind speed and direction for each month of the year.

40|$|In 2001, {{a weather}} and climate {{monitoring}} network was established along {{the temperature and}} aridity gradient between the sub-humid Moroccan High Atlas Mountains and the former end lake of the Middle Drâa in a pre-Saharan environment. The highest Automated Weather Stations (AWS) was installed just below the M'Goun summit at 3850 m, the lowest station Lac Iriki was at 450 m. This network of 13 AWS stations was funded and maintained by the German IMPETUS (BMBF Grant 01 LW 06001 A, North Rhine-Westphalia Grant 313 - 21200200) project and since 2011 five stations were further maintained by the GERMAN DFG Fennec project (FI 786 / 3 - 1), this way some stations of the AWS network provided data for almost 12 years from 2001 - 2012. Standard meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, and wind were measured {{at an altitude of}} 2 m above ground. Other meteorological variables comprise precipitation, station pressure, solar irradiance, soil temperature at different depths and for high mountain station snow water equivalent.

40|$|Over recent years, {{there has}} been a marked change in the {{handling}} of criminal cases before the Courts. The introduction of the Criminal Procedure Rules in 2005, along with initiatives such as Simple Speedy Summary Justice and more recently, Stop Delaying Justice, has created a shift away from slow moving cases and ambush defences. As a result, there is a presumption that criminal cases will progress from the very first hearing, fewer hearings are being adjourned and advocates on both sides are expected to be better prepared and ready to disclose their case from the outset. This paper will present an argument that it is now time to bring the principles behind these initiatives into the investigation stage of proceedings. By promoting better case management from the point of arrest, it is submitted that delays in resolving cases can be even further reduced, without affecting, but potentially improving fairness for all parties. Whilst the disclosure is given by many investigators, there is currently no rule that states that disclosure must be given at the police station stage. The authors contend that a requirement to provide disclosure at the police <b>station,</b> even in <b>summary</b> form, will allow more effective advice to be given to suspects and in turn improve the interview process. Early disclosure should prevent delays in bringing cases before the court and will also assist in ensuring that progress is made at the first hearing. Furthermore, by avoiding the need for unnecessary police bail appointments, and timely charging procedures, it is contended that summary justice can be achieved efficiently, fairly and in a manner that reduces tactical considerations in the police station...|$|R
40|$|Advances in nano-technology, bio-technology, nuclear {{medicine}} and the fundamental sciences require a facility to continue improving current capabilities in Europe beyond the year 2010. European competitiveness could benefit greatly from a unique research facility, flexible enough to satisfy users from many different fields of science and technology. The facility would be a valuable asset enabling economies of scale and giving Europe access to cutting-edge technology {{at the heart of}} future technological advances of major economic importance. Specialised facilities already operating at full capacity such as SINQ in Switzerland, ILL in France, have demonstrated the benefits of bringing together users from different scientific backgrounds and different countries. Such a research policy may be reinforced by the improved performance and greater reach of the EURISOL project which is aimed at a larger research community. Beneficiaries include the medical sciences such as oncology, medical imagery or studies of protein, as well as physics, astrophysics and cosmology, not forgetting nano-technology, supra-conductivity and general material technology. An initial Design Study funded by the European FP 6 research framework program was able to establish the case for the project on a well-founded scientific and technical basis in terms of user cost-benefit analysis, risk identification and mitigation.

40|$|Abstract: This mini-dissertation {{investigates the}} impact that Long Term Overheating and Creep (LTOC) has on coal fired power {{stations}} and the availability implications thereof. The need for the investigation arose from a single coal fired power station, with multiple boilers with a total generating capacity of greater than 400 MW, of which LTOC is the dominant boiler tube failure mechanism. For {{the purposes of the}} mini-dissertation, the power station was simply titled Power <b>Station</b> X. A <b>summary</b> is provided of the various boiler tube failure mechanisms as well as a brief description of availability. The mini-dissertation makes use of case studies in researching the matter of LTOC. It was seen that LTOC is a global matter, which is typically seen in ageing power stations. The major discussion points arising from the mini-dissertation is that of a boiler tube failure management program as well as correctly understanding the causes of boiler tube failures. With an adequate and correctly functioning boiler tube failure management program one can reduce and manage the occurrence of boiler tube failures. The second major discussion point arising from the mini-dissertation is that of correctly understanding the contributing factors to boiler tube failures. A lot of emphasis has been placed on the actual mechanisms and identification of failures, however the contributing factors and root cause has not been thoroughly investigated. Additionally one also has to identify the various areas prone to creep and the necessary remedial and mitigating actions for the removal and or replacement of such components, while keeping in mind the financial implication thereof. The mini-dissertation concludes with possible areas of future research as well as possible remedial actions that can be taken. M. Ing. (Engineering Management...|$|R
