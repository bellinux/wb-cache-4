The latter show was in June 2013 with Streeter Seidell, and although it sold out and extra dates were added, the performance was poorly received by local media: The Guardian Brian Logan said Hurwitz and Blumenfeld [...] "cackle a lot, as they find various ways to repackage tales of puerile behaviour as comedy". In June 2012, at the International Student Film Festival in Tel Aviv, Israel, the pair gave a lecture at the New Media Conference.

2500|$|Most Broadway {{shows are}} {{commercial}} productions {{intended to make}} a profit for the producers and investors ("backers" [...] or [...] "angels"), and therefore have open-ended runs (duration that the production plays), meaning that the length of their presentation is not set beforehand, but depends on critical response, word of mouth, and the effectiveness of the show's advertising, all of which determine ticket sales. Investing in a commercial production carries a varied degree of financial risk. Shows do not necessarily have {{to make a profit}} immediately. If they are making their [...] "nut" [...] (weekly operating expenses), or are losing money at a rate which the producers consider acceptable, they may continue to run in the expectation that, eventually, they will pay back their initial costs and become profitable. In some borderline situations, producers may ask that royalties be temporarily reduced or waived, or even that performers—with the permission of their unions—take reduced salaries, in order to prevent a show from closing. Theatre owners, who are not generally profit participants in most productions, may waive or reduce rents, or even lend a <b>show</b> <b>money</b> in order to keep it running.|$|E

2500|$|On July 24, 2014, it was {{announced}} that Diaz had signed a three-fight contract to return to the UFC. Diaz faced Anderson Silva on January 31, 2015 at UFC 183. He lost the fight by unanimous decision (46–49, 45–50, and 45–50). [...] A few days after the fight, the UFC revealed that Diaz had once again failed his post-fight drug test for marijuana metabolites, and Silva tested positive on January 9 for drostanolone, androstane, oxazepem, and temazepem in pre-fight drug screening. On August 13, after several reschedules, Silva's disciplinary hearing was held to decide on the subject. Silva's defense argued that a tainted sexual enhancement supplement was the root of the two failed tests for drostanolone and also appealed to mistakes in the NSAC testing procedures, pointing to a pair of drug tests, one on Jan 19 and one after the fight, which Silva passed. He admitted to using both temazepem and oxazepem, benzodiazepines, the night prior to the fight as therapy to control stress and help him sleep. Silva's team was unable to explain the presence of androsterone in the Jan 9 test. The commission rejected the defense and suspended him for one year retroactive to the date of the fight, as the current guidelines were not in effect {{at the time of the}} failed tests. Silva was also fined his full win bonus, as well as 30% of his <b>show</b> <b>money,</b> totaling $380,000. The result was overturned to a no contest.|$|E
