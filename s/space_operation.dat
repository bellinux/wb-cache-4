This <b>space</b> <b>operations</b> etiquette presumes that operations are conducted synchronously {{from a few}} centralized locations- a control center or space vehicle.

The <b>space</b> <b>operations</b> etiquette must be adapted to address the challenges that arise when changing to teams of distributed agents. We are investigating intelligent support agents for crew and ground personnel that implement an etiquette for notification and alerting, which {{is an essential part of}} the <b>space</b> <b>operations</b> etiquette. Our approach differs from previous work on notification and alerting because it focuses on meeting the needs of an organization rather than the needs of an individual.

50|$|In the European Union, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and Ofcom permit TV white <b>space</b> <b>operation</b> in 8 MHz {{channels}} between 490 and 790 MHz, {{with the}} GDB granting use {{for up to}} 2 hours. The allowed transmit power is dynamically set on a per-station basis, based on factors including the geographical distance to the next primary user in the given frequency. This closed-loop scheme requires each station to report its position after a timer has expired or it has moved 50 m or more, and to stop transmitting within 5 s when instructed to do so. Compared to the open-loop scheme used by the FCC, the closed-loop scheme used by the ETSI and Ofcom is more granular and allows for a more efficient spectrum utilization.|$|E
