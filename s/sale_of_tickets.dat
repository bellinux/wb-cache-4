5|$|LOCOG faced further {{criticism}} for how it handled the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> for the wheelchair areas within venues. In May 2012 the online <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> for wheelchair areas {{was replaced by}} a dedicated telephone hotline. Organisers were criticised for their use of an 0844 revenue share number for this hotline, and for neglecting to mention on its ticketing website that calls would be charged by the minute. Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe viewed this as discrimination against wheelchair users, and called upon LOCOG to compensate those who had used the hotline. LOCOG denied that it was receiving additional profits from the phone line, and claimed that a dedicated line was being used to allow customers to receive a service tailored to their individual accessibility needs.|$|E

Moreover, the cantons are required by federal law to levy a tax on the profit from the sale of real estate (Grundstückgewinnsteuer / impôt sur les gains immobiliers / Imposta sugli utili immobiliari). Most also levy a tax on the value of the property sold (Handänderungssteuer / impôt sur les mutations / Tassa di mutazione) so as to discourage speculation in real estate.

500|$|After a {{disastrous}} tryout in New Haven, Connecticut, the musical opened on Broadway {{to a large}} advance <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets,</b> and very mixed reviews.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to analyze}} the factors {{influencing}} the attendance of the historical monument, the castle Litice.

Into the determinants that have impact on the demand for attendance I include the ticket prices, temperature, precipitation, public holidays, weekends, summer holidays and cultural events. The model shows that an increase <b>of</b> <b>ticket</b> price by 1 % will result in increase <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> family <b>tickets</b> by 2, 4 % ceteris paribus. Regarding the standard and reduced ticket, the resulting coefficient is insignificant.

The most significant impact has an annual event "Pochod přes tři hrady" (March through three castles). During this event <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> standard <b>tickets</b> increase by 190 % and <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> reduced <b>tickets</b> are ten times higher ceteris paribus.
