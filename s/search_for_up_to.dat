The crucial prediction {{of the theory}} is an SU(2) lepton triplet with the mass below TeV. We study the signature of these heavy leptons and propose the strategy to test this mechanism at the hadron and lepton colliders. The smoking gun evidence of the theory is Delta L= 2 lepton number violation through events {{of a pair of}} like-sign leptons plus four jets without significant missing energy at hadron colliders. We find that via this unique channel, the heavy lepton can be <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a mass of 200 GeV at the Tevatron with 8 fb^- 1, and <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 450 (700) GeV at the LHC of 14 TeV C.

40|$|Profile-based {{sequence}} search {{procedures are}} commonly employed to detect remote relationships between proteins. We provide {{an assessment of}} a Cascade PSI-BLAST protocol that rigorously employs intermediate sequences in detecting remote relationships between proteins. In this approach we detect using PSI-BLAST, which involves multiple rounds of iteration, an initial set of homologues for a protein in a 'first generation' search by querying a database. We propagate a 'second generation' search in the database, involving multiple runs of PSI-BLAST using each of the homologues identified in the previous generation as queries to recognize homologues not detected earlier. This non-directed search process {{can be viewed as}} an iteration of iterations that is continued to detect further homologues until no new hits are detectable. We present an assessment of the coverage of this 'cascaded' intermediate sequence search on diverse folds and find that <b>searches</b> <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> three generations detect most known homologues of a query. Our assessments show that this approach appears to perform better than the traditional use of PSI-BLAST by detecting 15 % more relationships within a family and 35 % more relationships within a superfamily. We show that such searches can be performed on generalized sequence databases and non-trivial relationships between proteins can be detected effectively. Such a propagation of searches maximizes the chances of detecting distant homologies by effectively scanning protein "fold space"...|$|R
