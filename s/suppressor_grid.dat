This three-grid tube is called a pentode, meaning five electrodes. The pentode was invented in 1926 by Bernard D. H. Tellegen and became generally favored over the simple tetrode.

2500|$|The beam {{power tube}} {{is usually a}} tetrode with the {{addition}} of beam-forming electrodes, which take the place of the <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid.</b> These angled plates (not {{to be confused with the}} anode) focus the electron stream onto certain spots on the anode which can withstand the heat generated by the impact of massive numbers of electrons, while also providing pentode behavior. The positioning of the elements in a beam power tube uses a design called [...] "critical-distance geometry", which minimizes the [...] "tetrode kink", plate to control grid capacitance, screen grid current, and secondary emission from the anode, thus increasing power conversion efficiency. The control grid and screen grid are also wound with the same pitch, or number of wires per inch. The two grids are positioned so that the control grid creates [...] "sheets" [...] of electrons which pass between the screen-grid wires. They're aligned to be equidistant from, say, the bottom of the tube.|$|E
50|$|The pentode, as {{introduced}} by Tellegen, has an additional electrode, or third grid, called the <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid,</b> located between the screen grid and the anode, which solves {{the problem of}} secondary emission. The <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> is given a low potential, it is usually either grounded or connected to the cathode. Secondary emission electrons from the anode are repelled by the negative potential on the <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid,</b> so they can't reach the screen grid but return to the anode. The primary electrons from the cathode have a higher kinetic energy, so they can still pass through the <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> and reach the anode.|$|E
50|$|In the transitron circuit, {{the screen}} and <b>suppressor</b> <b>grids</b> are coupled with a bypass {{capacitor}} (C2) which has a low impedance at the oscillation frequency, {{so they have a}} constant potential difference. The parallel tuned circuit (C1-L) is connected between the screen grid and the cathode (through battery B1). The negative resistance of the screen grid cancels the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, causing oscillations. As in the dynatron oscillator the control grid can be used to adjust the negative resistance.|$|R
50|$|William Barr and Ralph Moir {{then ran}} a group which did {{a series of}} direct energy {{conversion}} experiments through the late 1970s and early 1980s. The first experiments used beams of positives and negatives as fuel, and demonstrated energy capture at a peak efficiency of 65 percent and a minimum efficiency of 50 percent. The following experiments involved a true plasma direct converter that was tested on the Tandem Mirror Experiment (TMX), an operating magnetic mirror fusion reactor. In the experiment, the plasma moved along diverging field lines, spreading it out and converting it into a forward moving beam with a Debye length of a few centimeters. <b>Suppressor</b> <b>grids</b> then reflect the electrons, and collector anodes recovered the ion energy byslowing them down and collecting them at high-potential plates. This machine demonstrated an energy capture efficiency of 48 percent. However, Marshall Rosenbluth argued that keeping the plasma's neutral charge over the very short Debye length distance would be very challenging in practice, though he said that this problem would not occur in every version of this technology.|$|R
50|$|A <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> is a grid {{used in a}} {{thermionic}} valve (also called vacuum tube) to suppress secondary emission. A <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> is also called the antidynatron grid, as it helps to reduce the dynatron effect.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{distinguish}} between the two versions of the heptode, manufacturers data often describes them as [...] "heptode of the hexode type" [...] for a heptode without a <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid,</b> and a [...] "heptode of the octode type", where a <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> is present.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Screen {{current and}} voltage in transitron oscillator. As the screen voltage VC2 becomes high {{enough that the}} <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> voltage turns positive, {{electrons}} begin passing through the <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> to reach the plate. Plate current increases and screen current decreases, giving the screen negative resistance (grey region).|$|E
5000|$|The transitron oscillator, {{invented by}} Cledo Brunetti in 1939, (although {{a similar effect}} was {{observed}} in tetrodes by Balthasar van der Pol in 1926, and Edward Herold described a similar oscillator in 1935) is a negative resistance oscillator circuit using a pentode vacuum tube, in which, instead of the plate, the screen grid has negative resistance due to being coupled to the <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid.</b> [...] See the circuit at right. In the transitron, the screen grid is biased at a positive voltage (battery B1) above the plate voltage while the <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> is biased negatively (battery B2), at or below the cathode voltage. Therefore, all the electrons will be reflected by the negative <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> and none will get through to the plate. The reflected electrons will instead be attracted to the screen grid, so the screen current will be high while the plate current will be zero. However, if the <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> voltage is increased, as it approaches zero (the cathode voltage) electrons will begin to pass through it and reach the plate, so the number diverted to the screen grid, and thus the screen current, will decrease. Since the other grids don't take significant current the cathode current [...] is split between the plate [...] and the screen grid : The division of current between the screen grid and plate {{is controlled by the}} suppressor voltage. This inverse relationship is indicated by saying the transconductance between the screen and <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> (the change in screen current ΔIG2 divided by the change in suppressor voltage ΔVG3) is negative.|$|E
50|$|In some designs, a <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> {{was added}} to produce yet another heptode design. Mullard's ECH81 became popular with the move to {{miniature}} nine-pin valves.|$|E
5000|$|The {{solution}} was to add another grid between the screen grid and the main anode, called the <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> (since it suppressed secondary emission current toward the screen grid). This grid {{was held at the}} cathode (or [...] "ground") voltage and its negative voltage (relative to the anode) electrostatically repelled secondary electrons so that they would be collected by the anode after all.

An alternative solution for power applications is the beam tetrode or [...] "beam power tube", discussed below.|$|E
50|$|In its {{simplest}} form, a <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid,</b> typically of coarse structure, is interposed {{between the}} screen grid and the anode (plate) of a tetrode, {{turning it into}} a pentode.|$|E
50|$|If the pinout of the 4307A is {{compared}} to that of the 807 the similarity is striking. All pins are assigned equivalent electrodes with the exception of pin 4, which is the <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid,</b> g3, in this type but in the 807 pin 4 is connected to the equivalent of a <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid,</b> the 'beam plates' and also the separate indirectly heated cathode.It is possible to interchange the two with the relatively minor alteration involving the linking of pins 4 and 5 and ensuring the heater supply is floating (not connected to other heaters). If the heater is supplied from an A.C. source, linking pin 4 to the centre of that source and the cathode bootstrap minimizes hum pickup.|$|E
5000|$|A pentode has an {{additional}} <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> (g3) {{to eliminate the}} tetrode kink. This is used for improved performance rather than extra gain and is usually not accessible externally. Some of these valves use aligned grids to minimise grid current and beam plates instead of a third grid, these are known as [...] "beam tetrodes".|$|E
50|$|The <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> {{is usually}} {{connected}} to the cathode {{and more often than}} not, this connection is made within the glass envelope. Because the grid is negatively charged relative to both the anode and the screen grid, it repels any secondary electrons back to the anode preventing them from contributing to the screen grid current, and to any negative resistance characteristic.|$|E
50|$|Since the <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> voltage and not {{the screen}} grid voltage {{controls}} the screen current, if the suppressor and screen grid are coupled together with a capacitor (C2) {{so there is a}} constant potential difference between them, increasing the screen grid voltage will increase the suppressor voltage, resulting in a decrease in screen current. This means the screen grid has negative differential resistance with respect to the cathode, and can be used to create oscillations.|$|E
50|$|The {{use of a}} pentode {{would seem}} an {{unlikely}} choice for a frequency converter because it only has one control grid. However, during the Great Depression, many American radio manufacturers used pentode types 6C6, 6D6, 77 and 78 in their lowest priced AC/DC receivers because they were cheaper than pentagrid type 6A7. In these circuits, the <b>suppressor</b> (<b>grid</b> 3) acted as the oscillator grid, and the valve operated {{in a similar manner}} to a true pentagrid.|$|E
5000|$|A pentode is an {{electronic}} device having five active electrodes. The term most commonly applies to a three-grid amplifying vacuum tube (thermionic valve), which {{was invented by}} Gilles Holst and Bernhard D.H. Tellegen in 1926. [...] The pentode consists of an evacuated glass envelope containing five electrodes in this order: a cathode heated by a filament, a control grid, a screen grid, a <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid,</b> and a plate (anode). The pentode (called a [...] "triple-grid amplifier" [...] in some early literature) was developed from the tetrode tube {{by the addition of}} a third grid, the <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid.</b> This served to prevent secondary emission electrons emitted by the plate from reaching the screen grid, which caused instability and parasitic oscillations in the tetrode. The pentode is closely related to the beam tetrode. Pentodes were widely used in industrial and consumer electronic equipment such as radios and televisions until the 1960s, when they were replaced by transistors. Their main use now is in high power industrial applications such as radio transmitters. The obsolete consumer tubes are still used in a few legacy and specialty vacuum tube audio devices.|$|E
50|$|In North America, {{the only}} octode {{manufactured}} was the 7A8. Introduced by Sylvania in 1939 (and used mostly by Philco), this valve {{was the product}} of adding a <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> to type 7B8, which was the loctal version of type 6A7. Adding the suppressor allowed Sylvania to lower the current of the 6.3-volt heater from 320 milliamperes to 150 milliamperes while maintaining the same conversion transconductance (550 microsiemens). This allowed Philco to use this valve in every line of radio throughout the 1940s.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem of}} {{secondary}} emission from the anode (US: plate) in the tetrode tube was solved by Philips/Mullard {{with the introduction}} of a <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> which resulted in the pentode design. Since Philips held a patent on this design, other manufacturers were keen to produce pentode type tubes without infringing the patent. In the UK, two EMI engineers, Cabot Bull and Sidney Rodda, produced and patented an alternate design in 1932. Their design had the following features (compared to the normal pentode).|$|E
50|$|It will {{be noted}} that the UK version would have had {{significant}} secondary emission and would also have had a tetrode kink. This was exploited in providing the non linearity necessary to produce good sum and difference signals. The American devices although having no secondary emission due to the <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid,</b> nevertheless were able to get the required non linearity by biasing the oscillator such that the valve was overdriven. The American version was also a little more sensitive because the grid that accepted the signal was closer to the cathode increasing the amplification factor.|$|E
50|$|The hexode (six-electrode) was {{actually}} developed after the heptode or pentagrid. It {{was developed in}} Germany as a mixer but was designed from the start {{to be used with}} a separate triode oscillator. Thus the grid configuration was grid 1, signal input; grids 2 and 4 screen grids (connected together - again, usually internally) and grid 3 was the oscillator input. The device had no <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid.</b> A major advantage was that by using grid 1 as the signal input grid, the device was more sensitive to weak signals.|$|E
5000|$|Power output pentodes, The EL34, EL84, 6CL6, 6F6, 6G6, SY4307A and 6K6GT {{are some}} {{examples}} of true pentodes used for power amplification, using a <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> rather than the higher efficiency beam-forming plates used in beam tetrodes. (Beam tetrodes were also {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "beam pentodes", and include the Sylvania (and possibly GE) 6CA7 version of EL34, 6V6GT and the GEC KT66 and KT88. Other sources preferred names such as [...] "beam power amplifier" [...] or [...] "beam power tube", possibly due to caution regarding the Philips pentode patent). Power output pentodes for specific television requirements, efficient for their job but possibly not linear enough for audio, were named: ...|$|E
50|$|In America, the {{configuration}} was different. Grid 1 acted as the oscillator grid as before, {{but in this}} case, grids 2 and 4 were connected together (again usually internally). Grid 2 functioned as both a screen and the oscillator anode; {{in this case the}} grid wire had to be present to provide the screening. Grid 3 accepted the incoming signal. Grid 4 screened this from the anode, and grid 5 was a <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> to suppress secondary emission. This configuration limited the oscillator design to one where the oscillator 'anode' was operated from the HT+ (B+) rail. This was often accomplished by using a Hartley Oscillator circuit and taking the cathode to the tap on the coil.|$|E
5000|$|EMI {{engineers}} Cabot Bull and Sidney Rodda {{improved the}} Harries design {{with a pair}} of beam plates, connected to the cathode, which directed the electron streams into two narrow areas and also acted like a <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> to deflect some secondary electrons back to the anode. The beam tetrode design was also undertaken to avoid the patents which the giant Philips firm held on power pentodes in Europe. Because this overall design eliminated the [...] "tetrode kink" [...] in the lower parts of the tetrode's voltage-current characteristic curves (which sometimes caused tetrode amplifiers to become unstable), M-OV marketed this tube family as the [...] "KT" [...] series, standing for [...] "kinkless tetrode".|$|E

50|$|Secondary {{emission}} can be undesirable {{such as in}} the tetrode {{thermionic valve}} (tube). In this instance the positively charged screen grid can accelerate the electron stream sufficiently to cause secondary emission at the anode (plate). This can give rise to excessive screen grid current. It is also partly responsible for this type of valve (tube), particularly early types with anodes not treated to reduce secondary emission, exhibiting a 'negative resistance' characteristic, which could cause the tube to become unstable. This side effect could be put to use by using some older valves (e.g., type 77 pentode) as dynatron oscillators. This effect was prevented by adding a third grid to the tetrode, called the <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid,</b> to repel the electrons back toward the plate. This tube was called the pentode.|$|E
50|$|Beam {{deflection}} tubes, sometimes {{known as}} sheet beam tubes, are vacuum tubes with an electron gun, a beam intensity control grid, a screen grid, sometimes a <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid,</b> and two electrostatic deflection electrodes {{on opposite sides}} of the electron beam, that can direct the rectangular beam to either of two anodes in the same plane. They can be used as two-quadrant, single-balanced mixers or (de)modulators with very linear qualities, their mode of operation similar to one-half of a Gilbert Cell, by applying an unbalanced signal f1 to the control grid and a balanced signal f2 to the deflection electrodes, then extracting the balanced mixing products f1 − f2 and f1 + f2 from the two anodes. Similar to a pentagrid converter, the cathode and the first two grids can be made into an oscillator. Two beam deflection tubes can be combined to form a double-balanced mixer.|$|E
5000|$|The beam {{power tube}} {{is usually a}} tetrode with the {{addition}} of beam-forming electrodes, which take the place of the <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid.</b> These angled plates (not {{to be confused with the}} anode) focus the electron stream onto certain spots on the anode which can withstand the heat generated by the impact of massive numbers of electrons, while also providing pentode behavior.

They're aligned to be equidistant from, say, the bottom of the tube.|$|E
50|$|The EL34 is a pentode, {{while the}} 6L6, which {{delivers}} a similar {{range of power}} output, is a beam tetrode which RCA {{referred to as a}} beam power tube. Although power pentodes and beam tetrodes have some differences in their principles of operation (the beam forming plates of the beam tetrode or fifth electrode (3rd grid) of the pentode, both serving to hinder the return of unabsorbed electrons from the anode (or plate) to the 4th electrode (2nd grid)) and have some internal construction differences, they are functionally closely equivalent. Unlike the 6L6, (EIA base 7AC) the EL34 has its grid 3 connection brought out to a separate Pin (Pin 1) (EIA base 8ET) and its heater draws 1.5 Amps compared to the 0.9 Amp heater in the 6L6. However, Sylvania (and possibly GE) marketed a tube as 6CA7 which was not only in a markedly different 'fat boy' envelope, but used a beam forming plate much like a 6L6. Examining the mica spacer {{on the top of the}} tube will confirm the lack of a <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid.</b> Although these tubes have similar (but not identical) characteristics, they are made very differently.|$|E
50|$|The beam tetrode {{was invented}} in Britain by two EMI engineers, Cabot Bull and Sidney Rodda, {{as an attempt to}} {{circumvent}} the power pentode, whose patent was owned by Philips. It was patented in 1933.Although the beam-plates (when present) could be counted as a fifth electrode (as in a pentode), this type of tube is nevertheless classified as a tetrode, perhaps to underline the difference in principle from that employed in true pentodes, which rely upon the effect of a <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid.</b> Beam tetrodes were widely used as audio power amplifying tubes in consumer and industrial electronic equipment such as radios and televisions until the 1960s when they were replaced by transistors. Their main use now is in high power industrial applications such as radio transmitters. Low power consumer beam tetrodes are still used in a few legacy and specialty vacuum tube audio power amplifier devices such as tube guitar amplifiers; the KT66 and KT88 are popular examples in audio equipment, while QY4-400 is an example having 400W anode dissipation, capable of applications in radio transmitters up to 100 MHz. The 4CX250B, mentioned above can be operated at full 250W anode dissipation up to 500 MHz. Many other types abound.|$|E
50|$|However, the tetrode kink {{limits the}} {{permissible}} variation of anode voltage, and restricts {{the use of}} screen-grid valves to small-signal applications. The <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> of the pentode eliminates the kink in the anode characteristic by preventing secondary electrons, which originate in the anode, from reaching the screen grid, and thus permits a wider excursion of anode voltage, as is required for power amplification. The same effect can be produced {{in the case of}} a tetrode by introducing two modifications. Firstly, the wires of the screen grid are aligned with those of the control grid so that the former lie in the electron 'shadow' created by the latter. This reduces the screen grid current, thereby giving greater efficiency, and also concentrates the electrons into dense beams in the space between the screen grid and the anode. The intense negative space charge of these beams prevents secondary electrons from the anode from reaching the screen grid, thus eliminated the tetrode kink. Secondly, in small valves whose electrode structure is supported in the conventional way with vertical wire rods and mica spacers, it was found to be necessary to introduce sheet-metal beam-forming electrodes between the screen grid and the anode. The purpose of these beam-plates is to constrain the electron beams into parts of the electrode system which are sections of a cylinder. (See sectional view, right). Successful creation of the electron beam between screen grid and anode required for a kinkless anode characteristic depends on the details of the geometry of the electrode structure of the beam tetrode. In the cases where the electrodes have complete cylindrical symmetry, a kinkless characteristic can be achieved without the need for beam-plates, alignment of the screen grid wires with those of the control grid being sufficient. This form of construction is usually adopted in the larger tubes with an anode power rating of 100W or more. The Eimac 4CX250B (rated at 250W anode dissipation) is an example of this class of beam tetrode. Note that a radically different approach is taken to the design of the support system for the electrodes in these types (see illustration). The 4CX250B is described by its manufacturer as a 'radial beam tetrode', drawing attention to the symmetry of its electrode system.|$|E
5000|$|The anode {{characteristic}} of a screen-grid valve is thus quite unlike that of a triode. It includes a range of anode voltages, where the anode voltage is {{less than that of}} the screen grid, {{in which there is a}} distinctive negative resistance characteristic, sometimes called [...] "tetrode kink". This is usually undesirable, although it can be exploited as in the dynatron oscillator (Eastman, p 431). The approximately constant-current region of low slope at high anode voltage is also a distinctive characteristic of the tetrode. This is highly desirable, since it corresponds to a high source resistance in the anode circuit, and greatly enhances the voltage gain which the device can produce. Early screen-grid valves had amplification factors (i.e. the product of transconductance and anode slope resistance) ten times that of comparable small-signal triodes. [...] The high anode resistance (i.e. low slope) in the normal operating range is a consequence of the electrostatic shielding action of the screen grid, since it prevents the electric field due to the anode from penetrating to the control grid region, where it might otherwise influence the passage of electrons, increasing the electron current when the anode voltage is high, reducing it when low.In practice the negative-resistance kink of the {{anode characteristic}} limits the usefulness of the screen-grid valve to applications where only small signals are amplified, so that the variations in anode voltage are also correspondingly small, and the operating conditions never depart from the region of high positive impedance (low positive slope) at large anode voltage. The secondary emission can be prevented from contributing to the screen current (and thus detracting from the anode current) by adding a <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid,</b> making a pentode, or beam plates to make a beam tetrode/kinkless tetrode, which can be used in power amplifiers where the variations of anode voltage, due to the presence of a large signal voltage, are much greater. The anode characteristics of these tubes are very similar to pentodes. In both cases the anode current rises rapidly to an approximately constant value when the anode voltage rises to as little as a few tens of volts, and the region of high positive anode resistance (low slope) extends from this low value up to the maximum anode voltage which could be several hundred volts or more.|$|E
40|$|The DIII-D tokamak employs eight ion {{sources for}} plasma heating. In {{order to obtain}} the maximum {{neutralization}} of energetic ions (providing maximum neutral beam power) and reduce the heat load on beamline internal components caused by residual energetic ions, sufficient neutral gas must be injected into the beamline neutralizer cell. The neutral gas flow rate must be optimized, however, since excessive gas will increase power losses due to neutral beam scattering and reionization. It is important, therefore, {{to be able to}} determine the neutralizer cell gas line density. A new technique which uses the ion source <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid</b> current to obtain the neutralizer cell gas line density has been developed. The technique uses the fact that slow ions produced by beam-gas interactions in the neutralizer cell during beam extraction are attracted to the negative potential applied to the <b>suppressor</b> <b>grid,</b> inducing current flow in the grid.
