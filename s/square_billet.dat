40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} whether the train axle cross wedge rolling(CWR) using <b>square</b> <b>billet</b> as blank is available or not. Based on numerical simulation software DEFORM- 3 D, we built the finite element model. And the whole forming process was simulated successfully. The stress and strain distributions of workpiece in the process were analyzed. The effect of forming angle, stretching angle and billet size on rolling force was investigated, then determined the proper process parameters. The differences between the round billet rolling and the <b>square</b> <b>billet</b> rolling were obtained by comparing the tangential, axial and radial forces during the rolling process. The studied results show the availability of using <b>square</b> <b>billet</b> as blank in train axle CWR and provide important realistic meaning and application value. The cross wedge rolling(CWR) is a metal deformation process of rotary forming. To produce a part, a billet should be placed between two rollers, which move tangentially relative to each other. The billet suffers plastic deformation during its rotation between two rollers. Compared with the traditional practices of forging and machining, CWR possesses many advantages, such as greate...|$|E

And on this basis, the effect of process parameters of primary cooling, mold powder, secondary cooling and electromagnetic stirring (EMS) on billet quality is investigated. With these studies, the {{continuous casting}} process is optimized, {{and the quality of}} square/round billet is improved as well.

40|$|Surface and {{internal}} quality of continuous casts depends {{very much on}} the behaviour of the strand in the mould. Among the parameters likely to influence this behaviour, the mould taper takes a prominen tpart. In order to understand better the influence of this parameter, we build up a thermal-mechanical finite element model. A slice of the strand is modelled and its evolution is observed. The main results are temperature field and solidification evolution, stree, strain and strain rate fields and losses of contact and returns to contact analysis. The model includes an elastic-viscous-plastic law, to describe the behaviour of steel from liquid to solid state, a thermal-mechanical element that takes into account thermal expansion and mechanical behaviour of the strand, a unilateral contact element, z mobile rigid boundary element to model the mould and its taper and an adapted loading element to model the ferrostatic pressure according to the liquid or solid state. This paper presents the first results obtained with an relatively simple section (a 125 mm <b>square</b> <b>billet).</b> Now the model is used with more complex section (beam blanks) and its validation is going on.

40|$|Extrusion, as a {{metal forming}} process, has {{definite}} advantages over rolling for production of three-dimensional section shapes. The very large reductions achieved in this process, even at high strain rates, {{have made it}} {{one of the fastest growing}} metal forming methods. With the increasing demand for sections of different shapes, it has become essential to develop analytical methods for their solution. The present investigation is a sincere attempt to develop a class of solutions for extrusion of different sections from round and <b>square</b> <b>billet</b> through converging dies by three-dimensional upper bound method as well as Finite element method. Three dimensional upper bound solutions are based on both continuous velocity field and discontinuous velocity field. The continuous velocity fields are based on dual stream function method. The discontinuous velocity fields are based on SERR (spatial elementary rigid region) technique. Upper bound method based on SERR technique is used for analysis of extrusion of pentagon, octagon, triangular and rhomboidal sections from round billet using linear converging die. The constant friction factor is assumed at the die billet interface. The single point formulation has been used keeping the die orifice in the centroid of billet axis so that product emerges straight. The extrusion pressure and die profile has been determined for different reductions and friction factors...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} a {{numerical}} model based on the finite element method applied to the continuous casting of steel. The model is developed using the LAGAMINE finite element code and two industrial applications of steel casting are presented to illustrate {{the capabilities of the}} model. The first chapter introduces the continuous casting process, defining the essential terminology and the industrial challenges. Then, the objectives of the model are detailed: the model is applied to {{the upper part of the}} caster (in the mould region) as well as to the bending and straightening zones. Chapters two, three and four are dedicated to the theoretical developments of thermal aspects (phase transformations, thermal contraction, heat flow and thermal boundary conditions), mechanical aspects (generalized plain strain state, material constitutive law, ferrostatic pressure and mechanical contact) and the staggered analysis used for thermal / mechanical coupling. In the two next chapters, some numerical results are presented. The model has been first applied to a 125 mm <b>square</b> <b>billet</b> in the mould region. The industrial goal is to evaluate the effect of the mould taper on the cooling of the billet (temperature evolution, solid shell growing, stress and strain development). The second application focuses on the risk of transverse cracking during straightening of steel slabs and the effect of some local defects (reduction of secondary cooling, locking or misalignment of rolls). The thesis ends with some concluding remarks and perspectives for the model...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The goal of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} formability of AZ 31 B magnesium alloy during incremental equal channel angular pressing (I-ECAP). <b>Square</b> <b>billets</b> were processed using different routes of I-ECAP at temperatures varying from 125 °C to 250 °C. The billets were obtained from commercially available coarse-grained, hot-extruded rod and fine-grained, hot-rolled plate. A strong influence of the initial microstructure on processing temperature was reported. Fine-grained samples were successfully processed at 200 °C, while coarse-grained ones must have been heated up to 250 °C to avoid fracture. A gradual temperature decrease with subsequent passes allowed successful pressing at 150 °C. Processing using various routes of I-ECAP showed that a billet rotation before the last pass had strong influence on mechanical properties. The results of experiments were plotted on the diagram of allowable processing temperature for AZ 31 B.

40|$|Continuous caster moulds are {{the last}} and most {{important}} stage in the steelmaking process, where inclusions can either be generated or removed. With increasing casting speed using conventional immersion nozzles critical problems, such as unstable bulk mould flow have been noticed. Mould flux entrapment due to vortex and shearing action from the oscillating surface waves have become of particular concern. It is therefore necessary to have a calm inlet flow {{at the entrance of}} the mould. Recently, it has been acknowledged that a swirl blade placed at the upstream of the immersion nozzle effectively resolves the problems arising from unstable bulk mould flow. Therefore, to increase the knowledge of effect of swirling flow on the flow pattern in the mould, fundamental mathematical models of a billet mould equipped with a swirl blade in the nozzle have been developed. The model was used to study the effect of divergent angle of the immersion nozzle and mould aspect ratio on the flow field and temperature distribution inside billets moulds. Data from water model experiments were used to verify the mathematical model predictions. A fairly good agreement was found between physical modeling data and predictions, which ensured that the numerical model is reliable. Thereafter, the differences between square and round billet moulds were studied. Next, the effect of changing aspect ratio of the rectangular mould on the fluid flow and heat transfer, while keeping mould surface area constant, was studied. Two types of immersion nozzles, bottomless and conventional, were also analyzed during the research. The model moulds were changed gradually from a <b>square</b> <b>billet</b> with an aspect ratio of 1 x 1 to a rectangular billet with an aspect ratio of 3 x 1. First, the temperature and velocity distributions were calculated. Later, unsteady calculations were done to determine velocity fluctuations on the meniscus level for two types of nozzles and several moulds geometries. QC 20101110 </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A two {{dimensional}} model {{was developed to}} predict the grain structure (Equiaxed to Columnar Transformation (ECT) and Columnar to Equiaxed Transformation (CET) in the continuous casting of steel. The processes of nucleation, growth and impingement of the grains are modelled as follows: (I) the nucleation is modeled through a continuous dependency of the nucleation density on temperature by the Gaussian distribution. Different nucleation parameters are used at the boundary and in the bulk region. (II) The growth and impingement are modeled by the Kurz, Giovanola, Trivedi (KGT) model. The Cellular Automata (CA) technique is used to solve the model. The CA method {{is based on the}} Nastac’s and simplified neighborhoods. Calculations are shown for <b>square</b> <b>billets</b> of the dimension 140 mm. Fixed input parameter of the model represents the macroscopic temperature field obtained from the Štore Steel billet simulation system [1]. All other grain structure physical model parameters are varied, such as: the surface and the bulk area, mean nucleation undercooling, standard deviation of undercooling, maximum density of nuclei. The computational parameters, such as the micro mesh size and the time step are varied as well. The influence of the variation of different parameters on calculated grain structure is shown. Finally, the model parameters are adjusted in order to obtain the experimentally determined actual billet ECT and CET positions for 51 CrV 4 +Mo spring steel (Al: 0. 02, Cr: 1. 05, Cu: 0. 125, Mn: 0. 9,Mo: 0. 025...|$|R

Simulated hot rolling tests, using pure lead as a model material, were performed on a laboratory mill to obtain data on load and torque when rolling <b>square</b> section stock. <b>Billet</b> metallurgy and consolidation of representative defects was studied when modelling the rolling of continuously cast square stock {{with a view to}} determining optimal reduction schedules that would result in a product having properties to the high level found in fully wrought billets manufactured from large ingots. It is difficult to characterize sufficiently the complexity of the porous central region in a continuously cast billet for accurate modelling. However, holes drilled into a lead billet prior to rolling was found to be a good means of assessing central void consolidation in the laboratory. A rolling schedule of 30 % (1. 429 : 1) per pass to a total of 60 % (2. 5 : 1) will give a homogeneous, fully recrystallized product. To achieve central consolidation, a total reduction of approximately 70 % (3. 333 : 1) is necessary. At the reduction necessary to achieve consolidation, full recrystallization is assured.
