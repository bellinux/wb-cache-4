2500|$|To {{oppose this}} was a [...] "tragic memory", which, in Poland, comes from its {{annexation}} after the Nazi-Soviet pact and the Katyn massacre, in the Baltic countries, from annexations by the Soviet Union from 1944 to 1990, and in Romania, from annexation by the Soviet Union of the regions of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina {{and the establishment of}} a long dictatorship (45 years). According to the historical Commissions report in 1991 on Roumania, nearly two million people were killed and nearly 300,000 people were deported to labour camps either within Romania itself, or to Siberia or Kazakhstan. This deep trauma resulted in Romania, by the creation in 1993 at Sighet, a prison used by the Romanian communist regime, a place of memory (research institute, library, museum and <b>summer</b> <b>university)</b> unique of its kind: the [...] "Memorial to the Victims of Communism and of the Resistance" [...] (Memorial to the Victims of Communism and of the Resistance) (Memorialul Victimelor Comunismului şi al Rezistenţei).

We still do not have physically relevant interacting models for d = 4, much less models which reproduce the results of the computation schemes developed by elementary particle theorists. A crucial problem for the scientific program of AQFT (and, I believe, its survival) is to demonstrate the existence of such models. Stephen J. <b>Summers</b> <b>University</b> of Florida Page 4 Constructive AQFT One strategy (Glimm & Jaffe, etc.) for obtaining such models is to construct first suitable local quantum fields by beginning with certain well–defined cutoff theories and controlling the limits as the cutoffs are removed. The net {A(O) } is then generated from these local fields. These fields are constructed in a concrete representation, which then determines a folium of states on A. This strategy relies heavily on (quasi–) classical intuitions...|$|R
