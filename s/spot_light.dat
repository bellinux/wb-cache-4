The band took 2011 {{as an opportunity to}} build a new recording studio, now named, The Stables Recording Studio, in regional Victoria, using it to record new material. In early 2011 the band took a portable recording studio on an elaborate round world writing trip.|$|E

500|$|Terence Stamp's {{name was}} {{deliberately}} {{kept out of}} the opening credits {{in order to keep the}} secret he was voicing Jor-El. Stamp originally portrayed General Zod in the first two Superman films, starring Christopher Reeve. Gough and Millar wanted to provide answers for certain aspects of the Superman mythology, so at the start of season three they tied Jonathan's heart condition to Jor-El, where Jonathan makes a deal with Jor-El to be given the power to bring Clark back. This power ultimately puts a strain on Jonathan's heart. The refusal by the film department to allow Smallville to cast a body as a physical representation of Jor-El forced the special effects crew to come up with a creative way to display some sort of aid to help the audience visualize this disembodied voice which was supposed to be talking to Jonathan in season three's [...] "Exile". They decided to create a force field around whoever was speaking to Jor-El, which acted as Jor-El's voice, rippling as he spoke. To save money on this effect, the crew filmed John Schneider on a black backdrop, and Entity FX digitally added the force field around him. Wind machines and a <b>spot</b> <b>light</b> were added to help synthesize the atmosphere in the force field. At the time of season three's [...] "Memoria", where a scene depicting Jor-El and Lara placing baby Kal-El into his ship before the destruction of Krypton was scripted, Warner Bros. was working on a new Superman film, and it was going to be an origin story, and as a result was still banning Smallville from showing Jor-El. Millar was forced to take inspiration from comic book scribe Jeph Loeb. In one of Loeb's book, Jor-El and Lara are depicted as just a pair of hands holding on to each other after they place Kal-El into his spaceship. In season nine, the producers were able to provide the character with a physical appearance, and Julian Sands was cast for the role.|$|E

2500|$|These {{fixtures}} {{feature a}} compound lens {{which allows the}} designer to place obstructions within the image path which are then projected. These obstructions could be [...] "gobos" [...] or shutters. A profile is a <b>spot</b> <b>light,</b> but allows for precise focusing. [...] This term is mostly used in the United Kingdom and Europe, as [...] "profile spots" [...] in the United States and Canada {{are referred to as}} [...] "ERS," [...] "ellipsoidals," [...] or just [...] "lekos," [...] from the original LekoLite created by Joseph Levy and Edward Kook, founders of Century Lighting, in 1933.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{blurring}} is {{not caused}} by random processes, such as light scattering, but can be well defined by the optical properties of the image formation in the microscope imaging system. If one considers a small fluorescent light source (essentially a bright <b>spot),</b> <b>light</b> coming from this spot spreads out further from our perspective as the spot becomes more out of focus. Under ideal conditions, this produces an [...] "hourglass" [...] shape of this point source in the third (axial) dimension. This shape is called the point spread function (PSF) of the microscope imaging system. Since any fluorescence image {{is made up of}} a large number of such small fluorescent light sources, the image is said to be [...] "convolved by the point spread function". The mathematically modeled PSF of a terahertz laser pulsed imaging system is shown on the right.|$|E

2500|$|The {{accident}} {{resulted in}} improved street lighting in the Medway Towns {{and the decision}} of all three services that a red light would henceforward be shown {{at the rear of}} all columns marching along roads at night. It should be noted that photographs taken by the police at the time showed the street to be lit by lamp standards which were typical in the country at the time and they were all (or almost all) in perfect working order. It has also been stated in official reports that the grim circumstances of the accident were particularly harrowing, given that several injured cadets were trapped under the bus and could not be extricated due to problems lifting the bus, which would have put additional weight on trapped survivors. [...] The subsequent Miinistry enquiry recommended that all UK buses should be fitted with a single kerb <b>spot</b> <b>light</b> and this recommendation was accepted. Although largely forgotten now this was probably the UK's second worst traffic accident ever if death and injuries are the only criteria. The Dibbles Bridge coach crash in 1975 left 33 dead and many more injured.|$|E

Wind machines and a <b>spot</b> <b>light</b> were added to help synthesize the atmosphere in the force field. Another aspect of the Superman mythology appeared in season three’s [...] "Hereafter", and was also created digitally: Superman’s cape. In the scene, Clark is touched by a boy who sees the moment of someone’s death; when he touches Clark he does not see Clark’s death but a cape flapping in the wind. Instead of just shooting a practical cape billowing, the scene was developed entirely by a computer. Created primarily by John Hahn, the idea was to show the cape but not so clearly that it would be obvious to the audience what they were looking at. As Beck explains, [...] "You get a hint of the 'S', but not quite." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} the present paper is the {{derivation}} of a merit function which predicts the visual perception of LED <b>spot</b> <b>lights.</b> The color uniformity level Usl is described by a linear regression function of the spatial color distribution in the far field. Hereby, the function is derived from four basic functions. They describe the color uniformity of <b>spot</b> <b>lights</b> through different features. The result is a reliable prediction for the perceived color uniformity in <b>spot</b> <b>lights.</b> A human factor experiment was performed to evaluate the visual preferences for colors and patterns. A perceived rank order {{was derived from the}} subjects’ answers and compared with the four basic functions. The correlation between the perceived rank order and the basic functions was calculated resulting in the definition of the merit function Usl. The application of this function is shown by a comparison of visual evaluations and measurements of LED retrofit spot lamps. The results enable a prediction of color uniformity levels of simulations and measurements concerning the visual perception. The function provides a possibility to evaluate the far field of <b>spot</b> <b>lights</b> without individual subjective judgment. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).
