40|$|An {{analysis}} is performed to investigate free and forced oscillation {{of a gas}} bubble and cavitation in viscoelastic liquids of a three‐parameter Oldroyd model. The first‐order perturbation method for small amplitudes has been employed to obtain periodic solutions to the bubble dynamics equation. Consideration {{is given to the}} influence of surface tension, vapor pressure, and thermodynamic behavior of the gas inside the bubble. It is disclosed that transient behavior of the bubble in viscoelastic liquids is governed by five dimensionless parameters. Conditions for stable bubbles are obtained. Free oscillation consists of a decaying exponential component and a damped <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> associated with the natural frequency of the bubble‐liquid system. The effects of the five governing parameters on the natural frequency are determined. The radial motion of the bubble in an oscillating pressure field includes a <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> associated with the forcing frequency, a decaying exponential component, and a damped <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> associated with the natural frequency. Criteria for the onset of incipient cavitation are determined when a bubble is suddenly released into the liquid or is situated in an oscillating pressure field...|$|R

50|$|In {{circular}} braiding, the bobbins (with {{opposite directions}} of rotation) move in two concentric orbits. The two orbits interfere to form dephased <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations</b> that determine the thread's pattern and crossing point. At this crossing point, the bobbins change their path {{to produce the}} upper and inner side of the braid. Generally, the circular braiding process produces braids with rotational symmetry. The over-braiding process follows the same principle as the circular braiding process, but the only modification is that the crossing point {{is located at the}} center.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the period}} 1943-1946, Bogolyubov's resesarch was {{essentially}} {{concerned with the}} theory of stochastic processes and asymptotic methods. In his work [...] a simple example of an anharmonic oscillator evolving under {{the force of the}} form as a superposition of incoherent <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations</b> with continuous spectrum was used to show that depending on a specific approximation time scale the evolution of the system can be either deterministic, or a stochastic process satisfying Fokker-Planck equation, or even a process which is neither deterministic nor stochastic. In other words, he showed that depending on the choice of the time scale for the corresponding approximations the same stochastic process can be regarded as both dynamical and Markovian, and in the general case as a non-Markov process. This work was the first to introduce the notion of time hierarchy in non-equilibrium statistical physics which then became the key concept in all further development of the statistical theory of irreversible processes.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to extend the {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) passive dynamic biped walker to a 3 -D dynamic biped walker, i. e., a walker that can walk on a horizontal surface based on a passive dynamic walking. A new prototype of 3 -D biped walker called RW 04, which has telescopic knee joints, was developed and its ability for walking was validated through some experiments. A <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation,</b> which is regarded as a central pattern generator with no sensory feedback, was provided to the knee joints to achieve the biped walking. The results showed that the biped gait of RW 04 was possible only via a <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> of the knee joint. Moreover, the 3 -D dynamic walking gait via frequency response and zero moment point (ZMP) trajectory was also analyzed. The biped locomotion had a resonance, i. e., the frequency matched the natural frequency of the locomotion in the gain property. An “ 8 ” shaped ZMP trajectory was observed, which was found to be similar to that of the human gait. However, the simple <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> had limitations such as stride reduction or discontinuation by phase difference. Therefore, in future work, more adaptable control strategy such as a sensory feedback using ZMP should be provided. ...|$|R

40|$|Free {{induction}} decay (FID) {{measured by}} {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) in a polycrystalline solid is the isotropic average of the FIDs for individual single crystallites. It has been recently proposed theoretically and verified experimentally that the long-time behavior of single-crystal FIDs has the universal form of exponentially decaying <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations.</b> Polycrystalline averaging complicates the situation theoretically, while the available experimental evidence is also ambiguous. Exponentially decaying <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations</b> have been observed for Xe- 129 in polycrystalline solid xenon but not for F- 19 in the powder of CaF 2. In this paper, we present the first principles FID calculations for the powders of both CaF 2 and solid xenon. In both cases, the asymptotic long-time behavior has the expected form of exponentially decaying <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations,</b> which {{is determined by the}} single crystallite FID with the slowest exponential decay. However, this behavior appears only at rather small values of the signal that have not yet been measured in experiments. At intermediate times accessible experimentally, a polycrystalline FID depends on the distribution of the exponential decay constants and oscillation frequencies for single crystallite FIDs. In CaF 2, these parameters are relatively broadly distributed, and as a result, the sinusoidal long-time oscillations become somewhat washed out. In contrast, the single crystallite parameters are more clustered in solid xenon, and, as a result, the experimentally observable range is characterized by well-defined oscillation frequency and exponential decay constant even though both of these parameters do not represent the true long-time behavior. The above difference of the intermediate FID behavior originates from the difference of the crystal structures of solid xenon and CaF 2. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|Monochromatic <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations</b> in {{the period}} range from 40 to 170 s were {{frequently}} observed by a synchronous satellite, ATS- 6,in August of 1975. During the observation period the satellite was located at 35 °east longitude {{and close to the}} geomagnetic equatorial plane. The present paper concerns with an examination on wave characteristics of these monochromatic <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations</b> and on an oscillation mechanism by analyzing numerous wave events observed by ATS- 6. The results indicate that oscillations show a clear local time variation {{in the period}}, shorter in the morning and longer in the evening. With regard to an oscillation mechanism our conclusion strongly supports a hypothesis that the second harmonic resonance oscillation of standing Alfven wave is most probably an oscillation mode near the synchronous orbit at 6. 6 earth radii. Another examination of the satellite and ground correlation of those waves indicates that there is a clear evidence of a rotation of the principal axis of the waves observed by the satellite and on the ground...|$|E
