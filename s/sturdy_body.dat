5|$|It is a big, strong cat, {{similar to}} the Maine Coon breed, with long legs, a bushy tail and a <b>sturdy</b> <b>body.</b> The breed {{is very good at}} climbing, since they have strong claws. The {{lifespan}} is usually 14 to 16 years, though kidney and heart diseases {{have been reported in the}} breed. Specifically in this breed, complex rearrangements of glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause a perinatal hypoglycaemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV.|$|E
500|$|The Norwegian Forest Cat is {{strongly}} built and larger than an average cat. Adult females {{of the species}} will typically weigh in at 3.5 - 4.5 kg (7.7 - 10 lbs), while males tends to weigh in at 5.5 to 7.5 kg (12 - 16.5 lbs) [...] The breed has a long, <b>sturdy</b> <b>body,</b> long legs and a bushy tail. The coat consists of a long, glossy, thick and water-repellent top layer and a woolly undercoat and is thickest at the legs, chest and head. The profile of the breed is generally straight.|$|E
500|$|Mary Shelley {{had called}} the baby Allegra [...] "the little Commodore" [...] because of her <b>sturdy</b> <b>body</b> and alert, {{intelligent}} look. Byron was also pleased with Allegra's resemblances to himself in appearance and temperament. When she was eighteen months old, {{he wrote in a}} letter to a friend: [...] "My bastard came three days ago—very like—healthy—noisy & capricious." [...] In an 1818 letter to his half-sister Augusta Leigh, Byron wrote that [...] "She is very pretty—remarkably intelligent ... She has very blue eyes—that singular forehead—fair curly hair—and a devil of a spirit—but that is Papa's." [...] In 1819, in another letter to Leigh, Byron described two and a half-year-old Allegra as [...] "very droll" [...] and again commented on her resemblance to himself in physical appearance, temperament and interests: [...] "(She) has a very good deal of the Byron. Can't articulate the letter 'r' at all—frowns and pouts quite in our way—blue eyes—light hair growing darker daily—and a dimple in the chin—a scowl on the brow—white skin—sweet voice—and a particular liking of Music—and of her own way in every thing—is that not B. all over?" [...] The child had forgotten any English she had learned and now spoke only Venetian Italian. In March 1820, he complained in a letter that three-year-old Allegra was vain and [...] "obstinate as a mule". Her behaviour was sometimes unmanageable, probably as a result of her unstable living arrangements and frequent changes in caregivers. [...] At age four, the naughty child terrorised Byron's servants with her temper tantrums and other misbehavior and told frequent lies.|$|E

50|$|The {{two types}} of Balinese are still {{analogous}} to their Siamese counterparts. While both are relatively slender, graceful fine-boned cats with long legs and tail, neat oval paws, almond-shaped eyes and large pointed ears, the traditional type is overall the more substantial, with a broader head and <b>sturdier</b> <b>body.</b> The modern type features a noticeably more wedge-shaped head with long tapering muzzle and longer, broader ears, atop a more slender and elongated body.|$|R

50|$|Since B. sylvestris {{lacks the}} ability to excrete wax, it is neither capable of {{producing}} eggs cells that enclose their eggs, nor does it {{have the capacity to}} create honey pots from which newly emerged broods may feed upon. However, this serves well in the defense of cuckoo bees, as there are no weak points between the abdominal segments of the cuckoo bee for other bees to pierce through using their stingers. Moreover, cuckoo bumblees are slightly less hairy, have shorter tongues, have more pointed abdomens, and contain much <b>sturdier</b> <b>bodies</b> than normal bees.|$|R

50|$|All {{the species}} in this genus were {{at some point}} {{referred}} to as Crinia. Further studies showed there was some considerable differences between this group of frogs and Crinia. These differences included; a slightly <b>sturdier</b> <b>body,</b> smoother skin on the ventral surface and the greatest difference, the reproductive nature, laying the eggs outside of water. Some species of Geocrinia go through the tadpole stage entirely in the egg capsule while others develop initially in the egg then hatch when sufficient rain falls for them to complete their larval development in water. Five of the seven species live in Western Australia while the other two species are confined to south-eastern Australia.|$|R

50|$|Like {{most of the}} rat snakes, Elaphe {{generally}} have slender but <b>sturdy</b> <b>bodies,</b> square heads and extremely flat belliesTheir sizes range from large medium to very large, growing even as large as 108 inches. Elaphe have large numbers of vertebrae, ribs and ventral scales but few rows of dorsal scales. The dorsal scales of Elaphe are characterized by having slight keels. In cross section Elaphe are shaped like a loaf of bread, the flat belly meeting {{the sides of the}} body at an angle. This special physical characteristic is well observed in Elaphe obsoleta whose belly scales curve upward. The curving of the ventral scales renders Elaphe better traction for tree climbing.|$|R

5000|$|The Ragdoll {{is one of}} {{the largest}} domesticated cat breeds, with a <b>sturdy</b> <b>body,</b> large frame, and {{proportionate}} legs. A fully-grown female weighs from 8 to 15 lb. Males are substantially larger, ranging from 12 to 20 lb or more. The genes for point coloration are responsible for the blue eyes of the Ragdoll. More intense shades of blue are favored in cat shows. Although the breed has a plush coat, it consists mainly of long guard hairs, while the lack of a dense undercoat results, according to the Cat Fanciers' Association, in [...] "reduced shedding and matting".|$|E
50|$|The ist, {{the sixth}} brand {{to use the}} Vitz as the base model, was {{conceived}} as a high-end multi-use compact car with SUV-like styling and wagon-like roominess. The car was fitted with either a 1.3-liter (FWD) or a 1.5-liter engine (FWD or 4WD), with a Super ECT transmission. A wide front grille consisting of two thick horizontal bars, large 15-inch tires, and extended wheel arches gave the vehicle its unique and dynamic exterior styling. The body dimensions were a notch above those of the Vitz, giving more space to the cabin and the trunk. The 6:4 split rear seats could be fully folded to widen the deck as necessary. The <b>sturdy</b> <b>body</b> structure was realized through the advanced GOA (Global Outstanding Assessment) process, which enhanced safety in collisions with heavier vehicles.|$|E
