Acknowledges Smith's letter of 17 April 1796, will respond more fully by next post, his time {{currently}} taken up <b>supervising</b> <b>workmen</b> {{working on his}} garden. His daughter died in March at 20 months. Recommends treating the 'Digitalis' like a hardy greenhouse plant...|$|R
25|$|Casement {{worked in}} the Congo for Henry Morton Stanley and the African International Association from 1884; this {{association}} became known as a front for King Leopold II of Belgium in his takeover of the Congo Free State. Casement worked on a survey to improve communication and recruited and <b>supervised</b> <b>workmen</b> in building a railroad to bypass the lower 220 miles of the Congo River, which is made unnavigable by cataracts, {{in order to improve}} transportation and trade to the Upper Congo. During his commercial work, he learned African languages.|$|R
40|$|Forgetting {{his native}} language. His {{gardening}} work: destroyed a vineyard {{to make a}} garden, building walls, and levelling ground, had to closely <b>supervise</b> <b>workmen</b> to control costs. Large part of new ground will be for a kitchen garden to feed his family and hopes to add a greenhouse but needs plans more specific than [James] Dickson's sent as the few greenhouses in Switzerland are "hardly better than cellars". Misses Smith and reminded of him daily. Requests Dickson to reserve "Hortus Siccus Britannicus" for him. Impatient for "English Botany" and "New Holland Botany", suggests sending them via a perfumers on Haymarket...|$|R
5000|$|During use, {{the engine}} needed {{constant}} supervision, with the stoker and superintendent on 24-hour call. One superintendent even installed a telescope in his window {{so he could}} <b>supervise</b> the <b>workmen</b> without {{the need to get}} his feet wet! ...|$|R
25|$|In 1887, {{two years}} after the Forest Preserve was created, members of the Balsam Lake club who hunted and fished on its lands near the {{headwaters}} of the Beaver Kill south of the mountain, decided to build a tower on the summit to detect fires early. A crew of <b>workmen</b> <b>supervised</b> by the club's warden built a small tower from trees cut near the summit.|$|R
25|$|The city of Novgorod {{preserved}} its architecture {{during the}} Mongol invasion. The first churches were {{commissioned by the}} princes; however, after the 13th century merchants, guilds and communities began to commission cathedrals. The citizens of 13th-century Novgorod were noted for their shrewdness, diligence and prosperity, expanding from the Baltic to the White Sea. The architecture in Novgorod did not begin to flourish until {{the turn of the}} 12th century. The Novgorod Sophia cathedral was modeled after the original Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev; it is similar in appearance but smaller, narrower and (in a development of North Russian architecture) onion-shaped domes replace cupolas. Construction was <b>supervised</b> by <b>workmen</b> from Kiev, who also imported bricks. The primary building materials were fieldstone and undressed limestone blocks. It is said that the interiors were painted in frescoes, which have now vanished. The doors were made of bronze.|$|R
50|$|On 21 April 1963, the 12:20 Holyhead to Euston express {{running on}} the up fast line {{collided}} with a rail-mounted crane whose boom was projected over the up fast line north of the station. The express struck the crane at a glancing blow, derailing the British Rail Class 40 hauling the train and four carriages. The accident {{was caused by the}} failure of the <b>workman</b> <b>supervising</b> the crane work, as he had arranged to guard the crane's work despite not being able to communicate with the signalmen who would stop the trains. A restaurant staff member aboard the express was slightly injured.|$|R
5000|$|In 1930, Ellingson {{enrolled}} as {{a graduate}} student in archaeology at Johns Hopkins University, studying under David Moore Robinson. The following year she joined Robinson's excavations at the ancient city of Olynthus in northeastern Greece, where she <b>supervised</b> dozens of <b>workmen</b> excavating houses on the site. [...] The Olynthus dig became famous in classical archaeology as the first to focus on houses and the domestic life of ancient Greece instead of on large public buildings like temples. Ellingson photographed the work in progress and created albums of these candid photographs. Her images show the archaeological techniques in use at the time, as well as daily life in the nearby village of Myriophyto where the crew lived.|$|R
