5|$|The use {{of small}} and large fish in the local economy was analyzed. Researchers found that while the less common large fish are sold for profit, the diet of Pak Mun villagers {{consisted}} mostly of <b>small</b> <b>fish</b> which can be caught in both the wet and dry seasons. <b>Small</b> <b>fish</b> are eaten, sold, and traded with the hill peoples for rice.|$|E

5|$|Skimmers are a {{small family}} of {{tropical}} tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for <b>small</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|E
50|$|B. bagarius is {{primarily}} entomophagous. It also feeds on <b>small</b> <b>fishes,</b> frogs and shrimps. B. suchus, however, is a piscivore. B. yarelli feeds primarily on prawns but also eat <b>small</b> <b>fishes</b> and aquatic insects.|$|R

5|$|The storm petrels are the {{smallest}} seabirds, {{relatives of the}} petrels, feeding on planktonic crustaceans and <b>small</b> <b>fish</b> picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.|$|E
5|$|They feed on <b>small</b> <b>fish</b> and {{occasionally}} young octopodes. They are {{often associated with}} the sea snake barnacle (Platylepas ophiophila) which attaches to their skin.|$|E
40|$|Landscape characteristics, disturbances, and {{temporal}} variability influence predator-prey relationships, but are often overlooked in experimental studies. In the Everglades, seasonal disturbances force the spatial overlap of predators and prey, potentially increasing predation risk for prey. This study examined seasonal and diel patterns of fish use of canals and assessed predation risk for <b>small</b> <b>fishes</b> using an encounter rate model. I deployed an imaging sonar in Everglades canals to quantify density and swimming speeds of fishes, and detect anti-predator behaviors by <b>small</b> <b>fishes.</b> Generally, seasonal declines of marsh water-levels increased {{the density of}} large fishes in canals. Densities of <b>small</b> and large <b>fishes</b> were positively correlated and, as small-fish density increased, schooling frequency also increased. At night, schools disbanded and <b>small</b> <b>fishes</b> were observed congregating along the canal edge. The encounter rate model predicted highest predator-prey encounters during the day, but access to cover may reduce predation risk for <b>small</b> <b>fishes...</b>|$|R

50|$|It eats {{a variety}} of {{invertebrates}} and <b>small</b> <b>fishes.</b>|$|R
5|$|It {{spends much}} of its time {{underwater}} in order to hunt, but returns to land to digest, rest, and reproduce. It has very potent neurotoxic venom which it uses to prey on eels and <b>small</b> <b>fish.</b> Because of their affinity to land, banded sea kraits often encounter humans, but the snakes are not aggressive and only attack in self-defense.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{have evolved}} {{a wide variety}} of {{features}} for feeding, which are mainly seen in their dentition. For example, the cheek teeth of pinnipeds and odontocetes are specifically adapted to capture fish and squid. In contrast, baleen whales have evolved baleen plates to filter feed plankton and <b>small</b> <b>fish</b> from the water.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels {{are small}} birds which {{spend most of}} their lives at sea, coming ashore only to breed. They feed on planktonic {{crustaceans}} and <b>small</b> <b>fish</b> picked from the surface, typically while hovering or pattering across the water. Their flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.|$|E
50|$|These fishes mainly feed on <b>small</b> <b>fishes</b> and crustaceans.|$|R

5|$|The cookiecutter shark uses {{bioluminescence}} to camouflage its underside by counterillumination, but a {{small patch}} near its pectoral fins remains dark, appearing as a <b>small</b> <b>fish</b> to large predatory fish like tuna and mackerel swimming beneath it. When such fish approach the lure, they are bitten by the shark.|$|E
5|$|The diet of many storm petrels {{species is}} poorly known owing to {{difficulties}} in researching; overall {{the family is}} thought to concentrate on crustaceans. <b>Small</b> <b>fish,</b> oil droplets and molluscs are also taken by many species. Some species {{are known to be}} rather more specialised; the grey-backed storm petrel is known to concentrate on the larvae of goose barnacles.|$|E
5|$|The storm petrels are {{relatives}} of the petrels and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on planktonic crustaceans and <b>small</b> <b>fish</b> picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.|$|E

5|$|The storm petrels are the {{smallest}} seabirds, {{relatives of the}} petrels, feeding on planktonic crustaceans and <b>small</b> <b>fish</b> picked from the surface, typically while hovering.

5|$|The storm-petrels are the {{smallest}} seabirds, feeding on plankton and <b>small</b> <b>fish</b> picked from the surface, typically while hovering. They nest in colonies on the ground, {{most often in}} burrows. There are about 20 species worldwide, {{two of which are}} rare vagrants to Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E

5|$|Banded sea kraits {{primarily}} feed on {{varieties of}} eels, but also eat <b>small</b> <b>fish.</b> Males and females exhibit sexual dimorphism in hunting behavior, as adult females, which are significantly larger than males, prefer to hunt in deeper water for larger conger eels, while adult males hunt in shallower water for smaller moray eels. In addition, females hunt {{for only one}} prey item per foraging bout, while males often hunt for multiple items. After hunting, the banded sea kraits return to land in order to digest their prey.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{this ability}} to digest food outside the body, starfish can hunt prey much larger than their mouths. Their diets include clams and oysters, arthropods, <b>small</b> <b>fish</b> and {{gastropod}} molluscs. Some starfish are not pure carnivores, supplementing their diets with algae or organic detritus. Some of these species are grazers, but others trap food particles from the water in sticky mucus strands that are swept towards the mouth along ciliated grooves.|$|E
5|$|Members of this {{community}} also herd zebu and catch fish in Lake Alaotra. The work of fishing was traditionally subdivided by gender: men were only allowed to fish for eels, while women were tasked to use nets to catch <b>small</b> <b>fish,</b> and children {{were the only ones}} allowed to fish using poles. Men and children would traditionally leave their catch on the shore for women to pick up and take back to the village.|$|E

50|$|Just as {{fisherman}} seek conditions {{where the}} chance of catching fish is optimized, fish seek areas where {{the chance of}} catching their food is optimal. Most game fish seek waters that are rich in food such as <b>smaller</b> <b>fish,</b> insects or shrimp. And, it follows, that these <b>smaller</b> <b>fish,</b> insects and shrimp congregate where their food is most concentrated.|$|R
50|$|P. friedrichsthalii has {{an unusual}} hunting mechanism. The species has been {{observed}} to lie immobile near the bottom, feining death. When <b>smaller</b> <b>fish</b> approach and attempt to pick at the dead fish, P. friedrichsthalii ambush the <b>smaller</b> <b>fish.</b> Similar behaviour has also been observed in some species of Lake Malawi cichlids, particularly from the genus Nimbochromis.|$|R
