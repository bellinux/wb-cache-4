5|$|The American {{historian}} Gary Clayton Anderson of the University of Oklahoma published Sitting Bull and the Paradox of Lakota Nationhood (2010), a revisionist {{examination of}} the Lakota medicine man. Anderson <b>stresses</b> <b>the</b> Little Big Horn in light of past successes of the Lakota Nation and the merits of Sitting Bull himself, rather than simply a mishap by Custer.|$|E
5|$|A third {{theme of}} the work is the stress on the {{importance}} and number of distinguished burials that took place at Ely. They would have increased the desire of others to be buried there, which would have benefited the community by the donations that would have flowed from those wishing to secure their burial. The Liber <b>stresses</b> <b>the</b> burials of Æthelstan, a Bishop of Elmham, that of Ælfwine, another Bishop of Elmham, and Wulfstan II, an Archbishop of York.|$|E
5|$|Because the self-anchored {{structure}} {{relies on}} the roadway itself to absorb <b>stresses,</b> <b>the</b> suspension cables could not be installed until the roadway was built; however, until the cables were in place the roadway could not be supported. To resolve this problem, Topham had the roadway built in sections, supported on very tall barges. The barges were floated into place at low tide, and the rising tide was used to lift the sections above {{the height of the}} piers. As the tide ebbed, the roadway dropped into place.|$|E
30|$|The {{plan has}} {{two types of}} {{temperature}} stress loadings: a progressive one (ξp[*]=[*]αt) and a constant one (ξc). <b>The</b> temperature <b>stresses</b> range from 0 to 1. The 0 denotes <b>the</b> normal working <b>stress</b> and <b>the</b> 1 denotes <b>the</b> highest test <b>stress.</b> <b>The</b> parameter ξp is the initial value of <b>the</b> progressive <b>stress,</b> and α is <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> ramp rate; ξc is a constant <b>stress.</b> <b>The</b> constant <b>stress</b> is always higher than <b>the</b> progressive <b>stress.</b> <b>The</b> parameter n denotes the number of samples, and πp denotes the allocation proportion of the samples at <b>the</b> progressive <b>stress.</b> <b>The</b> test continues until time τ.|$|R
40|$|Stress waves were induced in alumina ceramic rods by plate impact. <b>Stress</b> in <b>the</b> rods was {{measured}} by embedded manganin gauges. When <b>the</b> impact <b>stress</b> is below <b>the</b> compressive yield <b>stress,</b> a constant amplitude stress wave is produced in the rod. When <b>the</b> impact <b>stress</b> exceeds <b>the</b> yield <b>stress,</b> <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> in <b>the</b> rod decays with distance and time. <b>The</b> <b>stress</b> decay is consistant with lateral release involving dilatancy.

5|$|Disney {{learns that}} Travers is {{actually}} her pen name, {{taken from her}} father's given name. Her real name is Helen Goff, and she's actually Australian, not British. This gives Disney new insight into Travers, and he follows her to London. Arriving unexpectedly at her door, Disney tells her that {{he also had a}} less-than-ideal childhood, but <b>stresses</b> <b>the</b> healing value of his art. He urges Travers to not let deeply-rooted past disappointments dictate the present. Travers relents and grants Disney the film rights.|$|E
5|$|Lyrically, “Between You and Me” <b>stresses</b> <b>the</b> {{importance}} of seeking forgiveness from a friend. In addition, {{the bridge of}} the song addresses the need for confessing one's sins to God. DC Talk member Toby McKeehan, co-writer of the song, said that the lyrics simply describe the way relationships work. McKeehan later elaborated in an interview that the song came from his relationship with fellow band members Michael Tait and Kevin Max.|$|E
5|$|Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima <b>stresses</b> <b>the</b> {{dynamic of}} players' {{relationships}} with the main character in Final Fantasy games; thus, he puts significant thought into how that relationship will develop. With Final Fantasy VII, protagonist Cloud Strife's reserved nature led Nojima to include scenarios in which the player can select Cloud's responses to certain situations and dialogue. With Final Fantasy VIII, which also features a reserved lead protagonist in Squall, Nojima wanted to give players actual insight into what the protagonist is thinking, even while other characters remain uninformed: {{this led to the}} inner dialogues Squall has through the game.|$|E

5|$|A 1989 {{document}} generally {{known as}} Aspects of Christian meditation set forth {{the position of}} the Holy See with respect to the differences between Christian and eastern styles of meditation. The document, issued as a letter to all Catholic bishops, <b>stresses</b> <b>the</b> differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation. The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern meditation {{should not be confused with}} prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the letter said, meditation, which should be a flight from the self, can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.|$|E
5|$|One {{definition}} sees language {{primarily as}} the mental faculty that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and {{to produce and}} understand utterances. This definition <b>stresses</b> <b>the</b> universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the human brain. Proponents of {{the view that the}} drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, creole languages and spontaneously developed sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language. This view, which {{can be traced back to}} the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely innate, for example, in Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar, or American philosopher Jerry Fodor's extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a cognitive science framework and in neurolinguistics.|$|E
5|$|The {{means and}} speed {{by which the}} Picts {{converted}} to Christianity is uncertain. Bede gives {{the credit for the}} conversion to Ninian, probably because in the eighth century, when Bede was writing, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria was in control of the south-west of Scotland and an English bishop was in possession of the see that theoretically had been Ninians. Bede may have been reminding the Pictish church of its allegiance. Adomnan <b>stresses</b> <b>the</b> role of Columba in Pictland, and although the saint may have visited the region, since Adomnan does not make any claims for conversion, {{it is unlikely that the}} saint had any major impact. A separate mission, that may have been an attempt to evangalise the north-east, was undertaken by Columba's younger contemporary, another Irish priest, Donnán of Eigg, who had a large number of churches dedicated in his name in the region.|$|E

5|$|Young et al. (2012) used biomechanical {{modelling}} {{to examine the}} performance of the diplodocine skull. It was concluded that the proposal that its dentition was used for bark-stripping was not supported by the data, which showed that under that scenario, the skull and teeth would undergo extreme <b>stresses.</b> <b>The</b> hypotheses of branch-stripping and/or precision biting were both shown to be biomechanically plausible feeding behaviors. Diplodocine teeth were also continually replaced throughout their lives, usually in less than 35 days, as was discovered by Michael D'Emic et al. Within each tooth socket, as many as five replacement teeth were developing to replace the next one. Studies of the teeth also reveal that it preferred different vegetation from the other sauropods of the Morrison, such as Camarasaurus. This may have better allowed the various species of sauropods to exist without competition.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a decade}} from the {{outbreak}} of the revolt in 869, the Zanj had seized most of lower Iraq, including the cities of Basra and Wasit, and expanded into Khuzistan as well. In 879 the death of the founder of the Saffarid state, Ya'qub al-Saffar, allowed the Abbasid government to fully concentrate its attention against the Zanj rebellion, and Abu'l-Abbas' appointment to command in December 879 at the head of 10,000 troops marks the turning point of the war. In the long and hard struggle that followed, which involved amphibious operations in the Mesopotamian Marshes, Abu'l-Abbas and his own military slaves (ghilmān)—of which the long-serving Zirak al-Turki was the chief—played the major role: although the Abbasid armies eventually swelled with reinforcements, volunteers, and Zanj defectors, it was the few but elite ghilmān who formed the army's backbone, filling its leadership positions and bearing the brunt of the battle, often under the personal command of Abu'l-Abbas. After years of gradually tightening the noose around the Zanj, in August 883 the Abbasid troops stormed their capital of al-Mukhtara, putting an end to the rebellion. A detailed account of the war, written by a former Zanj rebel and preserved in the history of al-Tabari, <b>stresses</b> <b>the</b> role of al-Muwaffaq and Abu'l-Abbas as the heroes who, in defence of the embattled Muslim state, suppressed the rebellion; the successful campaign would become a major tool in their propaganda effort to legitimize their de facto usurpation of the Caliph's power.|$|E
