The layout of Han tombs were also built like underground houses, comparable to the scenes of courtyard houses found on tomb bricks and in three-dimensional models. Han homes had a courtyard area (and some had multiple courtyards) with halls that were slightly elevated above it and connected by stairways. Multi-story buildings included the main colonnaded residence halls built around the courtyards as well as watchtowers. The halls were built with intersecting crossbeams and rafters that were usually carved with decorations; stairways and walls were usually plastered over to produce a smooth surface and then painted.|$|R

5|$|There are few native natural predators of emus still alive. Early in its species history it {{may have}} faced {{numerous}} terrestrial predators now extinct, including the giant lizard Megalania, the thylacine, and possibly other carnivorous marsupials, which may explain their seemingly well-developed ability to defend themselves from terrestrial predators. The main predator of emus today is the dingo, which was originally introduced by Aboriginals {{thousands of years ago}} from a stock of semi-domesticated wolves. Dingoes try to kill the emu by attacking the head. The emu typically tries to repel the dingo by jumping into the air <b>and</b> kicking <b>or</b> <b>stamping</b> the dingo on its way down. The emu jumps as the dingo barely has the capacity to jump high enough to threaten its neck, so a correctly timed leap to coincide with the dingo's lunge can keep its head and neck out of danger.|$|R

Shuffling is applied before embedding to equalize the uneven embedding capacity from region to region. The hidden data can be extracted without using the original image, and can also be accurately extracted after high quality printing and scanning {{with the help of a}} few registration marks. The proposed data embedding method can be used to detect unauthorized use of a digitized <b>signature,</b> <b>and</b> annotate <b>or</b> authenticate binary documents.

When using Niederreiter, or in fact any cryptosystem based on error correcting codes, the second step in the signature scheme almost always fails. This is because a random syndrome usually corresponds to an error pattern of weight greater than t. The system then specifies a deterministic way of tweaking d until one is found which can be decrypted.|$|R

50|$|As with {{immersion}} lithography, defect {{control is}} expected to improve as the technology matures. Defects from the template with size below the post-imprint process bias can be eliminated. Other defects would require effective template cleaning and/or the use of intermediate polymer stamps. When vacuum is not used during the imprint process, air can get trapped, resulting in bubble defects. This is because the imprint resist layer <b>and</b> the template <b>or</b> <b>stamp</b> features are not perfectly flat. There is an elevated risk when the intermediate <b>or</b> master <b>stamp</b> contains depressions (which are especially easy air traps), or when the imprint resist is dispensed as droplets just before imprinting, rather than pre-spun onto the substrate. Sufficient time must be allowed for the air to escape. These effects are much less critical if flexible stamper materials are used, e.g. PDMS. Another issue is adhesion between stamp and resist. High adhesion (sticking) may delaminate resist, which than stays on stamp. This effect degrades pattern, reduces yield and damages stamp. It can be mitigated by employing an FDTS antistiction layer on a stamp.|$|R

It is currendy deposited from an initial gas mixture composed of hydrogen, ammonia and titanium tetrachloride. This paper reports on the optimization of its deposition conditions at atmospheric pressure. A complete factorial design with three factors and two levels, thus requiring 2 ^= 8 experiments, has been carried out. The following parameters were selected: the deposition temperature, the molar fraction of titanium tetrachloride and the molar fraction of ammonia. The influence of these factors on die deposition rate, the grain size estimated by die Scherrer method and the texture coefficient as determined by X-ray diffraction were studied. The mechanical properties of the coatings (microhardness, Young's modulus) were measured by depm-sensing indentation. 1...|$|R
