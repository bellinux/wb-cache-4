5|$|Fey {{attended}} Cardington-Stonehurst Elementary School and Beverly Hills Middle School in Upper Darby. By middle school, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{interested in}} comedy. Fey attended Upper Darby High School, {{where she was}} an honors student, {{a member of the}} choir, drama club, and tennis team, and co-editor of the school's newspaper, The Acorn. She also anonymously wrote the newspaper's satirical column, The Colonel. Following her graduation in 1988, Fey enrolled at the University of Virginia, where she studied play-writing and acting and was awarded the Pettway Prize. She graduated in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in drama. After college, she worked as a receptionist during the day at the YMCA in Evanston, Illinois, and took classes at the Second City at night.|$|E

She publicly identified as Muslim until 28 May 2002, when she acknowledged in her diary that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not.|$|E
25|$|After {{several months}} {{living with the}} Riglers, Genie's {{behavior}} and social skills improved {{to the point that}} she started going to first a nursery school and then a public school for mentally retarded children her age. The Riglers also taught her some basic self-help skills, including simple chores such as ironing, using a sewing machine, and preparing simple meals for herself. She made substantial progress with controlling herself both at home and in public, and although it was extremely hard to prevent her socially inappropriate masturbation she had almost entirely ceased it by the end of her stay. In February 1973 Curtiss recorded the first time Genie shared something with her, and while she continued to take things from other people her responses clearly indicated that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not supposed to.|$|E

500|$|Hathaway, by contrast, {{actively}} {{sought the}} part, tracing [...] "Hire me" [...] {{in the sand}} of the zen garden on Hacken's desk when she talked about the project with the executive. While Frankel liked her enough to not require her to audition, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not the studio's first choice {{and had to be}} patient (other accounts say that she was the only actress considered for the lead). Fox production chief Elizabeth Gabler says the studio did not realize how strong her audience was after the Princess Diaries movies. She took the part to work with Streep, but also due to some personal aspects. She celebrated when she learned she had gotten the part.|$|E
500|$|In 1926, Radclyffe Hall was at {{the height}} of her career. Her novel Adam's Breed, about the spiritual {{awakening}} of an Italian headwaiter, had become a bestseller; it would soon win the Prix Femina and the James Tait Black Prize. She had long thought of writing a novel about sexual inversion; now, she believed, her literary reputation would allow such a work to be given a hearing. Since <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> risking scandal and [...] "the shipwreck of her whole career", she sought and received the blessing of her partner, Una Troubridge, before she began work. Her goals were social and political; she wanted to end public silence about homosexuality and bring about [...] "a more tolerant understanding"– as well as to [...] "spur all classes of inverts to make good through hard work...and sober and useful living".|$|E
500|$|On 9 January 1950, Evita fainted {{in public}} and {{underwent}} surgery three days later. Although {{it was reported that}} she had undergone an appendectomy, she was diagnosed with advanced cervical cancer. Fainting continued through 1951 (including the evening after [...] "Cabildo abierto"), with extreme weakness and severe vaginal bleeding. By 1951, it had become evident that her health was rapidly deteriorating. Although her diagnosis was withheld from her by Juan, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not well, and a bid for the vice-presidency was not practical. Only a few months after [...] "the Renunciation", Evita underwent a secret radical hysterectomy in an attempt to eradicate her advanced cervical cancer. In 2011, a Yale neurosurgeon, Dr. Daniel E. Nijensohn studied Evita's skull x-rays and photographic evidence and said that Perón may have been given a prefrontal lobotomy in the last months of her life, [...] "...to relieve the pain, agitation and anxiety she suffered in the final months of her illness." ...|$|E

We are back together." [...] Following more speculation of the singer's return to the studio, Carey posted photos of herself and Rick Ross in Miami during late April, where the song was produced. Later revealed as the lead single from the singer's upcoming, yet-untitled fourteenth studio album, [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] was written and produced by Carey, Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox, with Ross and Meek Mill providing their verses. Relaying several hints regarding the song to the media, Carey explained the song's conception in a series of tweets on July 30, 2012: [...] "I wrote Triumphant when I was going through a difficult time and it helped me get through it. When u hear it, pay attention to the lyrics." [...] In an interview with MTV, Cox explained what fans would be able to expect from the song and why he felt Ross and Mill were [...] "the perfect fit." [...] He expressed how the [...] "inspirational song" [...] is close to Carey's heart and thought fans would become [...] "emotionally attached" [...] to it. Cox also added that Carey had committed herself to working on the album before <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> pregnant, but decided to halt its production until after she had given birth. With regard to the inclusion of the hip-hop duo, he explained how they became involved with the project: ...|$|E

I've been there {{and it seems like}} a little pro-Nazi Republic to me." [...] Bankhead, who loathed both Nazism and Communism, was outraged and thought Hellman a moral hypocrite. Hellman had never been to Finland, and Bankhead, as did the rest of the cast, suspected she refused the benefit due to a fanatical devotion to Soviet Russia. As a result of the feud, Hellman, who did not like being questioned and was used to getting her way, and Bankhead, who was always outspoken and hated being crossed when <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> morally right, became enemies.|$|E

2500|$|Macrobius {{provides}} invaluable {{details of}} her personality. Julia was well known for her gentle quick wit and sharp tongue. She was deeply loved by her father who admired her wit. Once, when asked her secret for having affairs while bearing children resembling her husband, she stated that she took on new passengers only when the boat was already full (meaning that she only took lovers when <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> already pregnant by her husband). Julia was equally celebrated for her beauty, intelligence and her shameless profligacy but mentions that [...] "she abused the indulgence of fortune no {{less than that of}} her father." [...] Despite Julia's reputation, the people who knew her described her as a good-hearted and kind woman who was very popular with the Roman people not least because of [...] "her kindness and gentleness and utter freedom from vindictiveness." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Coup of Gustav III on 19 August 1772, Sophia Magdalena was at Ekolsund Castle. After {{having been}} {{told of the}} {{successful}} coup where her consort had reinstated absolute monarchy, she confided to her Mistress of the Robes, Countess Anna Maria Hjärne, that she was afraid that she would now be divorced by Gustav, because <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not liked by him, because she had not given birth, and because <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> being slandered before him. Gustav III was told of this and her words led to a conflict. At a following ball at Ekolsund, the King told Count Axel von Fersen the Elder, that he did plan to divorce her {{on the grounds of}} pro-Danish plots and adultery with riksråd Count Fredrik Sparre and Marcus Gerhard Rosencrone of the Danish legation in Stockholm. von Fersen, however, convinced him not to by saying that she should not be regarded to participate in pro-Danish plots just for her love of her Danish chamber-maids, and that as a neglected wife, she should not be blamed for enjoying the compliments of Count Ribbing, which were not grounds for suspicions of adultery. During this period, it had been noted that Count Ribbing was often seen in the company of the Queen and had paid her compliments and made her laugh, among other things by caricaturing her Mistress of the Robes Countess Anna Maria Hjärne. Countess Hjärne had informed the King that the Queen was pregnant [...] "And the riksråd Ribbing is her favorite." [...] The King had given Countess Ulrica Catharina Stromberg the task to investigate this, and she was told by the chamber madame of Sophia Magdalena, Charlotta Hellman: [...] "information, which where dubious, especially since the clearest evidence could be gathered from the linen of the Queen". [...] her contact with Rosencrone {{is said to have been}} restricted to the fact that he handled her correspondence with Denmark. After the reconciliation of Sophia Magdalena and Gustav III, he apologized to her for having believed these rumors.|$|E
2500|$|Explaining {{the concept}} of the film, Lopez stated: [...] "There's twists and turns and it's {{exciting}} [...] but it also has a message, which is what attracted me to it in the first place, which is an empowering thing." [...] Describing its message, she said [...] " [...] you're in these negative situations, negative relationships, whatever, you can get out [...] The power to get out of those things is always within yourself. That's the message of the movie." [...] When Lopez read the script, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "going to have to do [...] whole sequence at the end" [...] which featured an act that required her to [...] "become a believable lean, mean fighting machine." [...] Lopez then thought she should learn T'ai Chi or Tae Kwon Do, but was worried about learning it at an expert level {{in a short period of}} time. Her personal trainer then suggested that she study Krav Maga, the [...] "official self-defense system of the Israeli Defense Forces which has recently become trendy in the States. The fighting style focuses on combating realistic scenarios with moves that are based on common, instinctual reactions", according to MTV News. Talking about the system, Lopez said: [...] " [...] levels out the playing field between men and women [...] Where it doesn't matter how big or tall or strong you are. You can actually maneuver around that. It's about getting out of the way, counter attacking and using whatever you can to get the upper hand." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{sensible}} epistemologist {{may not see}} how <b>she</b> could <b>know</b> that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not a Brain In a Vat (BIV); but she doesn’t panic. She {{sticks with}} her empirical beliefs, and as that requires, believes that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not a BIV. (She does not inferentially base her belief that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not a BIV on her empirical knowledge—she rejects that ‘Moorean’ response to skepticism.) Drawing on the psychological literature on metacognition, I describe a mechanism that’s plausibly responsible for a sensible epistemologist coming to believe <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not a BIV. I propose <b>she</b> thereby <b>knows</b> that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not a BIV. The particular belief-forming mechanism employed explains why she overlooks this account of how <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not a BIV, making it seem {{that there is no}} way for her to know it.

2500|$|At the 2010 CMT Music Awards, held in June, Swift {{encountered}} an ex-boyfriend of hers. The {{two were}} seated {{a couple of}} seats away from each other, but were unwilling to speak to each other, although they both had much to say. As a result, they both pretended to be heavily engaged in conversations with those surrounding them, individuals who Swift noted to be practically strangers. Swift had the desire to confront him and ask him if the experience was as painful for him {{as it was for}} her. However, she did not do so because they both had [...] "silent shields up". [...] "We're sitting six seats away from each other and just fighting this silent war of ‘I don't care that you're here.' I don't care that you're here.' It's so terribly, heartbreakingly awkward", she said. She recalled it to be a miserable experience. When Swift arrived home, she spoke to her mother about the encounter, sitting at her kitchen table and said, [...] "I felt like I was standing alone in a crowded room." [...] She then stood up and ran towards her bedroom to compose [...] "The Story of Us", something Swift's mother was already accustomed to. [...] "The Story of Us" [...] was the last track Swift composed for Speak Now, claiming that upon completing the song <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> done with the album. The song's subject was revealed by Swift to be the same for [...] "Dear John", which in an interview musician John Mayer confirmed that he was the song's subject. Furthermore, Swift and Mayer both attended the 2010 CMT Awards.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Executive Producer Louise Berridge {{decided to}} {{reintroduce}} the character 8 {{years after she}} had last appeared. Auditions were held to cast the role to a professional actor; however, auditionees were not informed which character they were auditioning for. The first audition was a group workshop of 30 auditionees, who were asked to perform improvisations. After whittling down potential actors from 500 to 4, {{the second stage of}} the audition process was an interview with EastEnders Casting Director. The auditionees were asked to perform a monologue {{in front of a camera}} and do a screen test with one of the actors already in the show, Christopher Parker, who played Spencer Moon. 17-year-old actress Scarlett Johnson was cast: [...] "At the second audition they gave me a monologue to read, but they'd been really careful about it. They hadn't said what the character's name was, they didn't give away anything in the monologue that might tell me who I was auditioning for. So I didn't know until I got the part who I was going to be playing--I'd been guessing for ages!" [...] Asked how she felt when <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> playing Vicki Fowler, a character linked to the show's early history who is the daughter of 2 prominent original characters, Johnson said: [...] "I felt very honoured, but it was quite scary. I knew there'd be a lot of people out there with expectations of what she'd be like. But it's good fun actually. It means you don't have to introduce yourself to everyone. You can really play with that [...] My family are EastEnders addicts, we've watched it our whole lives. I remember the first Vicki, I remember Michelle and I definitely remember Dirty Den! My knowledge of the show really helped a lot, because I didn't have to do any research into the character. When I joined the show, I felt like I was meeting the actors for a second time. I'd already met them in my home on TV, then I had to actually meet them in real life!" [...] The character made her reappearance in January 2003, turning up unexpectedly at her grandmother Pauline's (Wendy Richard) house.|$|E
