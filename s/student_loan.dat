5|$|On April 23, 2013, about 90 {{students}} held a walkout {{and protest}} in objection {{to a recent}} trend of declining enforcement of educational standards. The policy, requiring applicants to have professional kitchen experience, has varied from three months to a year, and is currently six months; a 2011 revision allowed front-of-house service to count for the requirement. The protesting students signed letters to teachers and the school administration, gave speeches, and donned name tags with their <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> debt written on them.|$|E
5|$|In state-run institutions, {{students}} {{only need}} pay registration fees; {{there are no}} tuition fees. Private institutions, however, charge fees. All students are eligible to some financial support from the Icelandic <b>Student</b> <b>Loan</b> Fund; the exact amount depends on their financial and personal situation. The student must begin to repay this money two years after completing their study programme. In addition to Icelandic students, students from the European Union or EEA-EFTA member states are also eligible to apply for loans, {{if they have been}} working in their trade in the country for at least one year.|$|E

5|$|The {{current rates}} were {{introduced}} in 2007. Previously, base tuition was only ₱300 per unit (since 1989). Library and miscellaneous fees were also increased in 2007, from ₱400 (US$9) per student to ₱1,100 (US$25) and ₱2,000 (US$46), respectively. New fees, such as internet and energy fees, were introduced. The USC sees the over 300 percent increase in tuition {{as the reason for}} the low enrollment rate and high <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> levels, which totaled some ₱14 million (US$326,000) in 2007. Additionally, it criticizes the STFAP for allegedly being ineffective. Upon its introduction in 1989, only 16 percent of students received discounts. The number fell to 12 percent in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The base {{tuition fee}} per unit in UPLB is ₱1,000 (US$23). As with all UP constituents, UPLB {{implements}} the Socialized Tuition and Financial Assistance Program (STFAP). Under the program, students with annual family incomes between ₱1,000,000 (US$23,000) and ₱500,000 (US$11,500) are charged the base tuition fee, while those with annual family incomes above ₱1,000,000 are charged ₱1,500 (US$35) per unit. Students with annual family incomes between ₱500,000 and ₱135,000 (US$3,110) are charged ₱600 (US$14) per unit; {{those who have}} between ₱135,000 and ₱80,000 (US$1,840) are charged ₱300 (US$7); while those who have below ₱80,000 are not charged any fees. Additional financial assistance may be accessed through the <b>Student</b> <b>Loan</b> Board, which pays up to 80 percent of the tuition. Scholarship and loan programs are also offered by some UPLB units, such as the College of Veterinary Medicine.|$|E
5|$|Alex Tew, {{a student}} from Cricklade in Wiltshire, England, {{conceived}} The Million Dollar Homepage in August 2005 when he was 21 years old. He {{was about to begin}} a three-year Business Management course at the University of Nottingham, and was concerned that he would be left with a <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> that could take years to repay. As a money-raising idea, Tew decided to sell a million pixels on a website for $1 each; purchasers would add their own image, logo or advertisement, and have the option of including a hyperlink to their website. Pixels were sold for US dollars rather than UK pounds; the US has a larger online population than the UK, and Tew believed more people would relate to the concept if the pixels were sold in US currency. In 2005, the pound was strong against the dollar: £1 was worth approximately $1.80, and that cost per pixel may have been too expensive for many potential buyers. Tew's setup costs were €50, which paid for the registration of the domain name and a basic web-hosting package. The website went live on 26 August 2005.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, <b>student</b> <b>loans</b> {{are rarely}} {{dischargeable}} in bankruptcy, and typically lenders provide <b>student</b> <b>loans</b> without requiring security. This stands {{in contrast to}} lenders requiring borrowers to have an equity stake in a comparably-sized real estate loan, as described above, secured by both a down payment and a mortgage. An explanation for the willingness of creditors to provide unsecured <b>student</b> <b>loans</b> is that, in a practical sense, American <b>student</b> <b>loans</b> are secured by the borrower's future earnings. This is so since creditors may legally garnish wages when a borrower defaults.|$|R

Private <b>student</b> <b>loans,</b> in most cases, are subject to statute of limitations laws depending on the state.|$|R
50|$|This section outlines, in {{very broad}} terms, {{the system of}} <b>student</b> <b>loans</b> in the UK. A {{non-governmental}} body {{was set up in}} 1989 (see <b>Student</b> <b>Loans</b> Company) to administer the awarding and recovery of these <b>loans.</b> The <b>Student</b> <b>Loans</b> Company is not directly mentioned in this section however; the statute only calls for the Secretary of State to administer these loans.|$|R
50|$|<b>Student</b> <b>loans</b> {{and grants}} in the United Kingdom are {{primarily}} {{provided by the}} government through the <b>Student</b> <b>Loans</b> Company (SLC), a non-departmental public body. The SLC is responsible for Student Finance England and is a delivery partner of Student Finance Wales and Student Finance NI. The Student Awards Agency for Scotland assesses applications in Scotland. Most undergraduate university students resident in the United Kingdom are eligible for <b>student</b> <b>loans.</b> In addition, some students on teacher training courses may also apply for <b>loans.</b> <b>Student</b> <b>loans</b> are also being rolled out, starting 2016/17, to postgraduate students who study a taught Masters, research or Doctoral course.|$|R

50|$|Created in 1981 as a quasi-governmental entity, MOHELA {{participated in}} the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) for nearly three decades. While fully {{supporting}} a portfolio of legacy <b>student</b> <b>loans</b> through FFELP, MOHELA completed steps to become a contractor to service federal <b>student</b> <b>loans.</b> MOHELA received the first not-for-profit (NFP) contract and began servicing <b>student</b> <b>loans</b> owned {{by the federal government}} under the U.S. Department of Education Federal Loan Program in October 2011.|$|R
40|$|The {{market for}} <b>student</b> <b>loans</b> may differ {{in some respects}} from other {{financial}} markets, but private lenders are {{the primary source of}} funds. As in other markets, the incentive to lend those funds comes from the ability to make a profit. But recent turmoil in financial markets is affecting all of the factors that contribute to the profitability of <b>student</b> <b>loans,</b> leading to speculation that the availability of such <b>loans</b> will fall. <b>Student</b> <b>loans...</b>|$|R
25|$|Wells Fargo private {{student loans}} are {{available}} to students to pay for college expenses, such as tuition, books, computers, or housing.

Wells Fargo also provides private <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> consolidation and student loans for parents.|$|E
25|$|Student Allowances, {{which are}} {{non-refundable}} grants to students of limited means, are means tested and the weekly amount granted depends on residential and citizenship qualifications, age, location, marital status, dependent {{children as well}} as personal, spousal or parental income. The allowance is intended for living expenses, so most students receiving an allowance will still need a <b>student</b> <b>loan</b> to pay for their tuition fees.|$|E

50|$|Many {{different}} types of loans can be taken out by a student or the student's parents {{in order to pay}} for higher education. In general these can be divided into two categories: federal <b>student</b> <b>loans</b> and private <b>student</b> <b>loans.</b>|$|R
40|$|The private {{market of}} <b>student</b> <b>loans</b> {{has become an}} {{important}} source of college financing in the U. S. Unlike government <b>student</b> <b>loans,</b> eligibility conditions on private <b>student</b> <b>loans</b> are based on the credit history of the student and the parents, who often serve as cosigners. Interest rates vary significantly with credit scores (from 7. 4 to 15. 4 percent). We quantify the effects of credit scores on college investment in a heterogeneous life-cycle economy that exhibits a government and private market for <b>student</b> <b>loans.</b> We find that students with better credit scores invest in more college education. The effect of credit scores on college investment is largest for students with low parental contributions for college and medium levels of ability. The importance of credit scores varies across alternative credit market arrangements: an increase in eligibility conditions in the private market for <b>student</b> <b>loans</b> induces a 5. 2 percent decline in the four-year college investment rate, whereas a relaxation in borrowing limits for government <b>student</b> <b>loans</b> leads to a 5. 1 percent increase in the four-year college investment rate, with most of the changes coming from students with low and medium credit scores...|$|R

It covers course fees, course related expenses, and can also provide a weekly living allowance for full-time students. The loan must be repaid at a rate dependent on income and repayments are normally recovered via the income tax system by wage deductions. Low income earners and students in full-time study can have the interest on their loans written off.|$|E

Although to a few {{this may have been}} unfair or inflationary, it appeared to have been legitimate.|$|E
25|$|PHEAA, however, was not {{directly}} {{under the control of}} the Governor.
