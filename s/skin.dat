5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of psoriasis is usually {{based on the}} appearance of the <b>skin.</b> <b>Skin</b> characteristics typical for psoriasis are scaly, erythematous plaques, papules, or patches of <b>skin</b> that may be painful and itch. No special blood tests or diagnostic procedures are needed to make the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|A frog's <b>skin</b> is protective, has a {{respiratory}} function, {{can absorb}} water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, {{particularly on the}} head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the <b>skin</b> moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The <b>skin</b> is shed every few weeks. It usually splits {{down the middle of the}} back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed <b>skin</b> is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.|$|E
5|$|Acne, {{also known}} as acne vulgaris, is a {{long-term}} <b>skin</b> disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead <b>skin</b> cells and oil from the <b>skin.</b> It is characterized by blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily <b>skin,</b> and possible scarring. It primarily affects areas of the <b>skin</b> with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, {{upper part of the}} chest, and back. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.|$|E

In this paper we describe <b>skinning</b> templates, which define common deformation behaviors for common joint types. This abstraction allows <b>skinning</b> solutions to be shared and reused, and they allow a user to quickly explore many possible alternatives for the <b>skinning</b> behavior of a character. The <b>skinning</b> templates are implemented using cage-based deformations, which offer a flexible design space within which to develop reusable <b>skinning</b> behaviors. We demonstrate the interactive use of <b>skinning</b> templates to quickly explore alternate <b>skinning</b> behaviors for 3 D models...|$|R
5|$|An {{elephant}} uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting its <b>skin</b> from ultraviolet light. Although tough, an elephant's <b>skin</b> is very sensitive. Without regular mud baths {{to protect}} it from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's <b>skin</b> suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the <b>skin</b> because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller than that of a human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.|$|E
5|$|As bikinis leave most of {{the body}} exposed to {{potentially}} dangerous UV radiation, overexposure can cause sunburn, <b>skin</b> cancer, {{as well as other}} acute and chronic health effects on the <b>skin,</b> eyes, and immune system. As a result, medical organizations recommend that bikini wearers protect themselves from UV radiation by using broad-spectrum sunscreen, which has been shown to protect against sunburn, <b>skin</b> cancer, wrinkling and sagging <b>skin.</b> Certain sunscreen ingredients can cause harm if they penetrate the <b>skin</b> over time.|$|E
5|$|Concentrated {{acetic acid}} is {{corrosive}} to <b>skin</b> and {{must therefore be}} handled with appropriate care to avoid <b>skin</b> burns, permanent eye damage, and irritation to the mucous membranes. These burns or blisters may not appear until hours after exposure.|$|E
40|$|Quaternion <b>Skinning</b> Quaternion <b>Skinning</b> {{refers to}} a number of <b>skinning</b> {{animation}} techniques that, in contrast to the standard <b>skinning,</b> often called linear blend <b>skinning,</b> use quaternions rather than matrices. Such methods have been developed with the purpose to eliminate well-known artifacts inherent to linear blend <b>skinning.</b> This sample demonstrates only one of those techniques, dual quaternion linear blending [1, 2]. We chose this method among other quaternion-based <b>skinning</b> approaches because {{it seems to be the}} most consistent from the mathematical point of view and thereby the least prone to producing artifacts...|$|R

5|$|Convergent {{evolution}} in humans includes blue eye colour and light <b>skin</b> colour. When humans migrated out of Africa, {{they moved to}} more northern latitudes with less intense sunlight. It was beneficial to them to reduce their <b>skin</b> pigmentation. It appears certain {{that there was some}} lightening of <b>skin</b> colour before European and East Asian lineages diverged, as there are some skin-lightening genetic differences that are common to both groups. However, after the lineages diverged and became genetically isolated, the <b>skin</b> of both groups lightened more, and that additional lightening was due to different genetic changes.|$|E
40|$|Figure 1 : Our {{compression}} model blends master bone transformations and caches them as virtual bone transformations (left most). It can compress Linear Blend <b>Skinning</b> (LBS) {{model with}} dense weights and generate a fast and compact model without sacrificing {{the quality of}} <b>skinning,</b> compared with dense-weight LBS model. Weighted linear interpolation has been widely used in many <b>skinning</b> techniques including linear blend <b>skinning,</b> dual quaternion blend <b>skinning,</b> and cage based deformation. To speed up performance, these <b>skinning</b> models typically employ a sparseness constraint, in which each 3 D model vertex has a small fixed number of non-zero weights. However, the sparseness constraint also imposes certain limitations to <b>skinning</b> models and their various applications. This paper introduces an efficient two-layer sparse compression technique to substantially reduce the computational cost of a dense-weight <b>skinning</b> model, with insignificant loss of its visual quality. It can directly work on dense <b>skinning</b> weights or use example-based <b>skinning</b> decomposition to further improve its accuracy. Experiments and comparisons demonstrate that the introduced sparse compression model can significantly outperform {{state of the art}} weight reduction algorithms, as well as <b>skinning</b> decomposition algorithms with a sparseness constraint...|$|R

50|$|<b>Skins</b> Rise is a feature-length {{episode of}} the E4 {{television}} series <b>Skins.</b> Airing in two parts in 2013, the episode was {{the third and final}} {{episode of the}} specially-commissioned seventh season intended to bring the series to a close, and the final episode of the series. While in its initial six-year run <b>Skins</b> was a teen drama about the lives of Bristolian teenagers, <b>Skins</b> Rise like the two previous episodes, <b>Skins</b> Fire and <b>Skins</b> Pure, is a filmically and tonally distinct drama which revisits one of the show's characters as they face adulthood.|$|R
5|$|Decreased {{levels of}} retinoic acid in the <b>skin</b> may {{contribute}} to comedo formation. To address this deficiency, methods to increase the skin's production of retinoid acid are being explored. A vaccine against inflammatory acne has shown promising results in mice and humans. Some have voiced concerns about creating a vaccine designed to neutralize a stable community of normal <b>skin</b> bacteria that is known to protect the <b>skin</b> from colonization by more harmful microorganisms.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{possibility}} of respiration across the <b>skin</b> combined with small size, all known lungless tetrapods are amphibians. The majority of salamander species are lungless salamanders, which respirate through their <b>skin</b> and tissues lining their mouth. This necessarily restrict their size: all are small and rather thread-like in appearance, maximising <b>skin</b> surface relative to body volume. Other known lungless tetrapods are the Bornean flat-headed frog and Atretochoana eiselti, a caecilian.|$|E
5|$|Elemental iodine {{is also a}} <b>skin</b> irritant, {{and direct}} contact with <b>skin</b> can cause damage and solid iodine {{crystals}} should be handled with care. Solutions with high elemental iodine concentration, such as tincture of iodine and Lugol's solution, are capable of causing tissue damage if used in prolonged cleaning or antisepsis; similarly, liquid Povidone-iodine (Betadine) trapped against the <b>skin</b> resulted in chemical burns in some reported cases.|$|E

5|$|Hemorrhagic {{smallpox}} is {{a severe}} form that {{is accompanied by}} extensive bleeding into the <b>skin,</b> mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract. This form develops in approximately 2 percent of infections and occurred mostly in adults. In hemorrhagic smallpox the <b>skin</b> does not blister, but remains smooth. Instead, bleeding occurs under the <b>skin,</b> making it look charred and black, hence this form of the disease {{is also known as}} black pox.|$|E
5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common. Giant Schnauzers {{are also}} prone to eye {{problems such as}} keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma, cataracts, multifocal retinal dysplasia, and generalized progressive retinal atrophy.

5|$|Hydroquinone lightens the <b>skin</b> {{when applied}} topically by {{inhibiting}} tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine to the <b>skin</b> pigment melanin, {{and is used}} to treat acne-associated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. By interfering with new production of melanin in the epidermis, hydroquinone leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened <b>skin</b> cells are naturally shed over time. Improvement in <b>skin</b> hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily. Hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of <b>skin</b> such as the dermis. The use of a sunscreen with SPF15 or higher {{in the morning with}} reapplication every two hours is recommended when using hydroquinone. Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal <b>skin</b> but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened <b>skin</b> around the hyperpigmented area. Hydroquinone is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., <b>skin</b> irritation) and occur with use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration. Most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite, which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people. In extremely rare cases, repeated improper topical application of high-dose hydroquinone has been associated with an accumulation of homogentisic acid in connective tissues, a condition known as exogenous ochronosis.|$|E
5|$|If the {{clinical}} diagnosis is uncertain, a <b>skin</b> biopsy or scraping may be performed {{to rule out}} other disorders and to confirm the diagnosis. <b>Skin</b> from a biopsy will show clubbed epidermal projections that interdigitate with dermis on microscopy. Epidermal thickening is another characteristic histologic finding of psoriasis lesions. The stratum granulosum layer of the epidermis is often missing or significantly decreased in psoriatic lesions; the <b>skin</b> cells from the most superficial layer of <b>skin</b> are also abnormal as they never fully mature. Unlike their mature counterparts, these superficial cells keep their nucleus. Inflammatory infiltrates can typically be visualized on microscopy when examining <b>skin</b> tissue or joint tissue affected by psoriasis. Epidermal <b>skin</b> tissue affected by psoriatic inflammation often has many CD8+ T cells while a predominance of CD4+ T cells makes up the inflammatory infiltrates of the dermal layer of <b>skin</b> and the joints.|$|E
