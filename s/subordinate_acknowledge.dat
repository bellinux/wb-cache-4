40|$|Prepared for {{issue of}} the American Behavioral Scientist on “Legitimacy in the Modern World. ” This essay {{develops}} a theory of relational authority in the most unpromising setting of international relations. Relational authority locates legitimacy in a social contract between a ruler, who provides a social order of value to the ruled, and the ruled who comply with the ruler’s commands necessary {{to the production of}} that order. International politics are near universally assumed to be an anarchy devoid of authority. Through the lens of relational authority, however, we see that relations between states are better described as a rich variety of hierarchies in which dominant states legitimately rule over greater or lesser domains of policy in subordinate states. After contrasting alternative approaches to authority, part two identifies international hierarchies and summarizes a suite of measures that capture variations between the United States and other states. Part three deduces a set of international behaviors that follow from relational authority and demonstrates that 1) the United States is more likely to join international disputes in which its subordinates are involved and 2) <b>subordinates</b> <b>acknowledge</b> the authority of the dominant state by engaging in actors of symbolic obeisance, of which the most costly and salient form is following the United States into war...|$|R
50|$|The {{connections}} that Tesnière describes {{in this passage}} are now more widely called dependencies, hence the term dependency grammar. Two words that are connected by a dependency do not have equal status, but rather the one word is the superior, and the other its subordinate. Tesnière called the superior word the governor, and the inferior word the <b>subordinate.</b> By <b>acknowledging</b> the totality of connections between {{the words of a}} sentence, Tesnière {{was in a position to}} assign the sentence a concrete syntactic structure, which he did in terms of the stemma (see below).|$|R
50|$|The {{alternative}} used by {{competitors to}} CORBA {{is simply to}} forgo the subroutine model so that the superior continues to execute concurrently with the delegated operations. The superior simply prepares a message that {{is sent to the}} subordinate. The <b>subordinate</b> immediately <b>acknowledges</b> the receipt of the message that requests the accomplishment of the delegated operation (without yet starting to accomplish the delegated operation itself). The superior then goes about other business, such as preparing messages for other delegated operations either to that same subordinate or to other subordinates. Each subordinate that has been delegated an operation, enqueues the operation's requesting message in a message queue that corresponds to the message's priority or deadline. A thread (perhaps in a thread pool) dequeues that message from that queue to accomplish the delegated operation. Upon accomplishment, the result is sent as a different message to the superior. The superior processes the result messages similarly to the way the subordinate processed the delegation messages.|$|R
5|$|After the battle, Browning {{was awarded}} the Order of Polonia Restituta (II class) by the Polish government-in-exile, but his {{critical}} evaluation of the contribution of Polish forces led to the removal of Major-General Stanisław Sosabowski as commanding officer of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade. Some writers later claimed that Sosabowski had been made a scapegoat {{for the failure of}} Market Garden. Montgomery attached no blame to Browning or any of his <b>subordinates,</b> or indeed <b>acknowledged</b> failure at all. He told Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), the professional head of the British Army, that he would like Browning to take over VIII Corps in the event that Richard O'Connor, the GOC, were transferred to another theatre.|$|R
50|$|By the 18th century, {{due to the}} Canton {{constraints}} that forbade contact between European and Chinese civilians, Europeans were forced to trade with imperial trade monopolies. These constraints not only forbade the close contact between Europeans and the Chinese civilians, but also forbade any women or European families from living in China. Britain tried to build an embassy in China {{in order to gain}} special treatment. China considered all outsiders as “barbarians” and trading partners only. In the mind of the Chinese aristocracy, Europeans were considered “vassals” of the Emperor and had to pay tribute and <b>acknowledge</b> <b>subordinate</b> position to the Emperor and the Chinese. Because he considered the Europeans to be barbarians, he didn't want them to influence Chinese society and culture, keeping them to specific ports. This was a turning point in Anglo-Chinese relations.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} scandal broke, Randy David, a nonpartisan {{columnist}} of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, cited two {{excerpts from the}} Ong recording in an article. Sheila Coronel, of the Philippine Center of Investigative Journalism, was able to decipher some of the garbled parts of the tape, which allegedly implicated Arroyo in the scandal. David analyzed the tapes using ethnomethodology {{and came to the}} same conclusions as did Coronel. His analysis described one of the speakers as a female coming across as a person speaking to her <b>subordinate.</b> Later, Arroyo <b>acknowledged</b> that it was her voice on the recording (Arroyo's [...] "I'm Sorry" [...] speech, 3.96MB MP3). However, no trial took place regarding Arroyo's intentions with her conversations in the recordings. According to Philippine law, both recordings are part of the public domain and are freely distributable.|$|R
5000|$|The {{emergence}} of the mestizo class was a social phenomenon not localized in the Philippines, but was also very much present in the American continent.On 22 March 1697, Charles II of Spain issued a Royal Cedula, related to this phenomenon. The Cedula gave distinctions to classes of persons in the social structure of the Crown Colonies, and defined the rights and privileges of colonial functionaries. In doing so, the Spanish Monarch touched {{another aspect of the}} colonial society, i.e., the status of indigenous nobles, extending to these indigenous nobles, as well as to their descendants, the preeminence and honors customarily attributed to the Hidalgos of Castile. The Royal Cedula stipulates:“Bearing in mind the laws and orders issued by my Progenies, Their Majesties the Kings, and by myself, I order the good treatment, assistance, protection and defense of the native Indians of America, that they may be taken cared of, maintained, privileged and honored like all other vassals of my Crown and that, in the course of time, the trial and use of them stops. I feel that its timely implementation is very suitable for public good, {{for the benefit of the}} Indians and for the service of God and mine. That, consequently, with respect to the Indian mestizos, the Archbishops and Bishops of the Indias are charged by Article 7, Title VII, Book I of the Laws of the Indies, for ordaining priests, being attentive to the qualities and circumstances present, and if some mestizas ask to be religious, they (Bishops) shall give support to those whom they admit in monasteries and for vows. But in particular, with regard to the requirements for Indians in order to accede to ecclesiastical or secular, governmental, political and military positions, which all require purity of blood and, by its Statute, the condition of nobility, there is distinction between the Indians and mestizos, inasmuch as there is between the 1 descendants of the notable Indians called caciques, and 2 those who are issues of less notable Indian tributaries, who in their pagan state acknowledged vassalage. It is deemed that all preeminence and honors, customarily conferred on the Hijosdalgos of Castile, are to be attributed to the first and to their descendants, both ecclesiastical and secular; and that they can participate in any communities which, by their statutes require nobility; for it is established that these, in their heathenism, were nobles to whom their <b>subordinates</b> <b>acknowledged</b> vassalage and to whom tributes were paid. Such kind of nobility is still retained and acknowledged, keeping these as well as their privileges wherever possible, as recognized and declared by the whole section on the caciques, which is Title VII, Book VI of the Laws of the Indies, wherein for the sake of distinction, the subordinate Indians were placed under (these noble’s) dominion called «cacicazgo», transmissible from elder to elder, to their posteriority…” ...|$|R

Indeed, so {{singularly}} unlucky {{were the}} British Fairies that, as {{has already been}} hinted, amid {{the wreck of the}} Gothic mythology, consequent upon the introduction of Christianity, they seem to have preserved, with difficulty, their own distinct characteristics, while, at the same time, they engrossed the mischievous attributes of several other classes of <b>subordinate</b> spirits, <b>acknowledged</b> by the nations of the north. The abstraction of children, for example, the well known practice of the modern Fairy, seems, by the ancient Gothic nations, to have rather been ascribed to a species of night-mare, or hag, than to the berg-elfen, or duergar. In the ancient legend of St Margaret, of which there is a Saxo-Norman copy, in Hickes' Thesaurus Linguar. Septen. and one, more modern, in the Auchinleck MSS., that lady encounters a fiend, whose profession it was, among other malicious tricks, to injure new-born children and their mothers; a practice afterwards imputed to the Fairies. Gervase of Tilbury, in the Otia Imperialia, mentions certain hags, or Lamiae, who entered into houses in the night-time, to oppress the inhabitants, while asleep, injure their persons and property, and carry off their children. He likewise mentions the Dracae, a sort of water spirits, who inveigle women and children into the recesses which they inhabit, beneath lakes and rivers, by floating past them, {{on the surface of the}} water, in the shape of gold rings, or cups. The women, thus seized, are employed as nurses, and, after seven years, are permitted to revisit earth. Gervase mentions one woman, in particular, who had been allured by observing a wooden dish, or cup, float by her, while washing clothes in a river. Being seized as soon as she reached the depths, she was conducted into one of these subterranean recesses, which she described as very magnificent, and employed as nurse to one of the brood of the hag who had allured her. During her residence in this capacity, having accidentally touched one of her eyes with an ointment of serpent's grease, she perceived, at her return to the world, that she had acquired the faculty of seeing the dracae, when they intermingle themselves with men. Of this power she was, however, deprived by the touch of her ghostly mistress, whom she had one day incautiously addressed. It is a curious fact, that this story, in almost all its parts, is current in both the Highlands and Lowlands of Scotland, with no other variation than the substitution of Fairies for dracae, and the cavern of a hill for that of a river.[A] These water fiends are thus characterized by Heywood, in the Hierarchie-- ...|$|R
