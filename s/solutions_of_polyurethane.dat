40|$|This {{research}} paper presented {{a novel approach}} of developing excellent protection from ultraviolet (UV) radiation of cotton fabrics by means of water vapor permeable (WVP) coatings containing multiwall carbon nanotube (MWNT), a stable and strongly UV absorbing species. The WVP of MWNT containing UV protective coatings of the present development are formed from <b>solution</b> polymer <b>of</b> hydrophilic <b>polyurethane</b> (HPU). MWNTs were dispersed in HPU <b>solution</b> by functionalization <b>of</b> MWNT. The nanotube containing HPU coating shows excellent protection against UV radiation, with only 1 wt % of MWNT (calculated based on solid content of the polymer), a UV Protection Factor (UPF) of 174 and with 2. 5 wt % of MWNT a UPF of 421 was obtained, which stated excellent protection (UPF ≥ 50) according to the Australian/New Zealand standards. Scanning electron micrographs of coated fabrics surface showed a film like polymer coating, confirming the fabric surface was successfully coated by polyurethane. The coated fabrics would maintain very good water vapor permeability, hence confirmed the wearing comfort. Room temperature (20 - 23 °C) range soft segment crystal melting of HPU enhances the permeability of coated fabrics. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

40|$|Gamma {{radiation}} can be {{used for}} enhancing the physical properties <b>of</b> <b>polyurethane</b> (PU). Radiation was used to crosslink a polyurethane at room temperature; four samples of the PU solid film are irradiated at variable four radiation doses 0, 50, 100, and 150 [*]kGy under vacuum conditions. Crosslinking radiation is more common than oxidative degradation and crosslinking is believed to be more efficient in the soft segment of PU. The structure of the PUs is performed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR-ATR), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA-DTG), and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) which have been used to investigate the effect of gamma radiation on the polyurethane (PU).

This 30 -year study is the longest examination of the use of polyurethane-coated implants and their correlation with capsular contracture. MethodsThis study evaluates the senior surgeon's (F. D. P.) experience with the use of polyurethane-coated implants in aesthetic breast augmentation in 382 patients over 30 years. Follow-up evaluations were conducted for six months after surgery. After the six-month follow-up period, 76 patients returned for reoperation. The gross findings, histology, and associated capsular contracture were noted at the time of explantation. ResultsNo patient during the six-month follow-up period demonstrated capsular contracture. For those who underwent reoperation for capsular contracture, Baker II/III contractures were noted nine to 10 years after surgery and Baker IV contractures were noted 12 to 21 years after surgery. None of the explanted implants had macroscopic evidence <b>of</b> <b>polyurethane,</b> which was only found during the first five years after surgery. The microscopic presence <b>of</b> <b>polyurethane</b> was noted in all capsules up to 30 years after the original operation. ConclusionsAn inverse correlation was found between the amount <b>of</b> <b>polyurethane</b> coating on the implant and the occurrence of capsular contracture. Increasingly severe capsular contracture was associated with a decreased amount <b>of</b> <b>polyurethane</b> coating {{on the surface of the}} implants.
