5|$|The He 111P {{incorporated}} the updated Daimler-Benz DB 601A-1 liquid-cooled engine and featured a newly designed nose section, including an asymmetric mounting for an MG 15 machine gun that replaced the 'stepped' cockpit with a roomier and more aerodynamic glazed <b>stepless</b> cockpit {{over the entire}} front of the aircraft. This smooth glazed nose was first tested on the He 111 V8 in January 1938. These improvements allowed the aircraft to reach 475km/h (295mph) at 5,000m (16,400ft) and a cruise speed of 370km/h (230mph), although a full bomb load reduced this figure to 300km/h (190mph). The design was implemented in 1937 because pilot reports indicated problems with visibility.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the He 111 A-L {{initially}} had a conventional stepped cockpit, {{with a pair of}} windscreen-like panels for the pilot and co-pilot. The He 111P and subsequent production variants were fitted with fully glazed cockpits and a laterally asymmetric nose, with the port side having the greater curvature for the pilot, offsetting the bombardier to starboard. The resulting <b>stepless</b> cockpit, which was a feature on a number of German bomber designs during the war years in varying shapes and formats, no longer had the separate windscreen panels for the pilot. Pilots had to look outside through the same bullet-like glazing that was used by the bombardier and navigator. The pilot was seated on the left and the navigator/bomb aimer on the right. The navigator went forward to the prone bomb-aiming position or could tilt his chair to one side, to move into the rear of the aircraft. There was no cockpit floor below the pilot's feet—the rudder pedals being on arms—giving very good visibility below. Sliding and removable panels were manufactured into the nose glazing to allow the pilot, navigator and or bomb aimer to exit the aircraft quickly, without a time-consuming retreat into the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|Like the British Class 50s, {{they were}} {{equipped}} with an English Electric 16 CSVT engine and produced 2700hp (2020 HP at the wheels). Unlike the BR locomotives upon which electronic control is extensively used, the Portuguese locomotives employ conventional control gear (the only exceptions being <b>stepless</b> control of tractive effort by a solid-state load regulator {{and the use of}} a very effective out-of-balance wheel-slip detector). The main generator and the traction motors are identical to those used on the BR Type 3 and Deltic locomotives. Contrary to BR Class 50, the Portuguese Série 1800 locomotives were built to be as much compatible with the smaller Série 1400 (themselves similar to BR Class 20) as possible and also to use as many common components as possible.|$|E
25|$|Boeing {{submitted}} its Model 345 on 11 May 1940, {{in competition}} with designs from Consolidated Aircraft (the Model 33, later to become the B-32), Lockheed (the Lockheed XB-30), and Douglas (the Douglas XB-31). Douglas and Lockheed soon abandoned work on their projects, but Boeing received an order for two flying prototypes, given the designation XB-29, and an airframe for static testing on 24 August 1940, with the order being revised to add a third flying aircraft on 14 December. Consolidated continued to work on its Model 33 as it was seen by the Air Corps as a backup in case of problems with Boeing's design. Boeing received an initial production order for 14 service test aircraft and 250 production bombers in May 1941, this being increased to 500 aircraft in January 1942. The B-29 featured a fuselage design with circular cross-section for strength. The need for pressurization in the cockpit area also led to the B-29 being one of very few American combat aircraft of World War II to have a <b>stepless</b> cockpit design, without a separate windscreen for the pilots.|$|E
2500|$|Ford {{gave the}} Escort‐based Orion saloon a similar makeover. Carried {{over from the}} {{previous}} range was the 3-speed automatic which was ultimately replaced late in the production run with {{a variant of the}} CTX <b>stepless</b> gearbox as first used in the Fiesta a couple of years earlier. A luxurious Orion 1600E with leather seats, fuel injection, alloy wheels, and a Ghia trim was produced during 1989 and 1990. A total of 1,600 were made, with 1,000 of these having leather trim. The Orion range was also broadened to include a more basic [...] "L" [...] trim for the first time.|$|E
2500|$|The hull, {{like the}} rest of the aircraft, was {{all-metal}} and rectangular, with flat sides and top. Its planing bottom was also flat, with two steps. Stability on the water was provided by long, <b>stepless</b> floats on each side, strut-mounted from the wings a little outside the engines and braced to the fuselage with a parallel pair of horizontal struts. [...] The hull tapered in plan to the tail, where the empennage was again rectangular, with a broad fin reaching out beyond the end of the hull and carrying a balanced rudder. [...] The tailplane was mounted on the fin about one third of the way up, braced from below with a single strut on each side, and carried narrow-chord elevators.|$|E
2500|$|Currently the Blue Line uses 27 Flexity Swift {{light rail}} {{vehicles}} (LRVs) manufactured by Bombardier and 12 Siemens S70 LRVs. The {{system is designed}} to output 750 volts of direct current. Trains can reach speeds of , but the “general service speed” is about [...] or slower (especially in the congested downtown region). They are of a 70% low-floor design, meaning that 70 percent of the floor inside is within about [...] of the ground. This is the same height as the rail platforms, allowing <b>stepless</b> access for passengers dependent on wheelchairs or other mobility aids. The feature also {{makes it easier for}} passengers with bicycles or strollers to board the train. Each vehicle weighs about [...] when empty. Minneapolis is the first and only city to use this LRV model in the United States.|$|E

5000|$|In {{aircraft}} design, <b>stepless</b> cockpit {{means that}} {{the nose of the}} aircraft has no separate [...] "windscreen" [...] panels {{directly in front of the}} pilot's or co-pilot's seating positions, and generally has no [...] "breaks" [...] in the nose contour — curved or otherwise — from their absence. In the conventional design, the pilot's cabin is a different part of the aircraft than the nose. The <b>stepless</b> design is believed to help make the plane more aerodynamic thus aiding speed and fuel efficiency. The <b>stepless</b> design does however prevent the inclusion of a turreted gun position.|$|E

50|$|The Vario {{transmission}} {{was first}} {{developed in the}} 1970s, but {{due to lack of}} funding it was never seen on a production tractor until 1996, when Fendt launched the revolutionary Fendt 926 Vario. This was the first ever <b>stepless</b> transmission to be launched in the tractor market, and is patented to be the only truly <b>stepless</b> transmission when it was first developed. Competitors were unable to make a transmission as advanced as a Fendt Vario at the time with hydrostatics as the only real competition, however these soon fell out of favour. In today's market all major manufacturers offer a <b>Stepless</b> box which will be branded by the manufacturer individually; however most operators will refer to it as a Vario much in the way that most vacuum cleaners are referred to as a Hoover.|$|E

50|$|A <b>stepless</b> type of {{ear clamp}} {{was invented by}} Hans Oetiker in Horgen, Switzerland, which {{eliminates}} steps or gaps on the inner circumference of the clamp. This is said to provide uniform compression and a 360° seal.Such <b>stepless</b> clamps are claimed to be well suited to applications involving thin-walled hoses, supposedly with higher retained loads. This suggests they should be considered for difficult to seal applications such as molded plastics or other less malleable materials, commonly used in the automotive industry.|$|E
5000|$|The {{idea of a}} low-floor tram {{dates back}} to the early 20th century when a number of trolley systems began experimenting with various [...] "stepless" [...] designs. Perhaps the most notable is the Hedley-Doyle <b>Stepless</b> car {{introduced}} in 1912 for use on Broadway in Manhattan. [...] A number of other cities also purchased Hedley-Doyle <b>Stepless</b> trams after seeing their success in Manhattan. Since these cars had a unique appearance compared to any other trams running at the time, they earned a number of nicknames, including hobble skirt cars, public welfare cars, and sow bellies.|$|E
5000|$|New York City's New York Railways experimented in 1912 with a Brill {{double deck}} Hedley-Doyle <b>stepless</b> center {{entrance}} car, nicknamed the [...] "Broadway Battleship", {{a term that}} spread to other large streetcars.|$|E
50|$|Control of {{traction}} and {{rheostatic braking}} on the Class 7E1 is by <b>stepless</b> solid-state electronics. The electrical equipment {{was designed for}} high power factor operation, obtained by the switching in of power-factor correction capacitors.|$|E
50|$|International Harvester {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} manufacturers to provide a <b>stepless</b> transmission in a row crop tractor. Introduced first as an option on 656 and 544 tractors, the hydrostatic transmission would become a defining feature of the 70 Hydro and 100 Hydro models.|$|E
50|$|Multitronic is a <b>stepless</b> {{transmission}} {{launched by}} AUDI AG in late 1999, jointly developed and manufactured by LuK, {{a division of}} the Schaeffler Group. The capitalization used is multitronic (spelled by Audi with a lower-case leading 'm') and is a registered trademark of AUDI AG.|$|E
50|$|Control of {{traction}} and {{rheostatic braking}} on the Class 7E is by <b>stepless</b> solid-state electronics. The electrical equipment {{was designed for}} high power factor operation, obtained by a sector control method. These were the first South African AC electric locomotives with thyristor technology from the 50 c/s Group.|$|E
50|$|Despite each deck having {{multiple}} levels separated by steps, {{they are all}} wheelchair accessible. The undulations of each level provide for a smooth, <b>stepless</b> path {{from one end of}} the deck to the other (going widthwise). These paths are visually marked by yellow metal discs embedded into the decks themselves.|$|E
50|$|The Wulfrunian {{body was}} lower built as this chassis was {{designed}} as a low height bus with <b>stepless</b> entrance and centre gangways on both decks. Roe also softened the outline of the body with a subtly curved rear dome; the use of equal-depth windows on both decks produced a much more balanced look.|$|E
50|$|The {{control of}} {{traction}} and rheostatic braking on the Class 7E2, Series 1 is by <b>stepless</b> solid-state electronics. The electrical equipment {{was designed for}} high power factor operation, obtained by a sector control method. Like the earlier South African Class 7E, these locomotives are equipped with thyristor technology from the 50 c/s Group.|$|E
50|$|The Genesis camera family {{consisted}} of 4 models (see table below), each new model replacing the previous one. All models had a fixed zoom, motorized <b>stepless</b> autofocus, autoexposure, a built-in pop-up flash, motorized film transport, and automatic (DX) film sensing. The first two releases had fairly boxy designs; {{the latter two}} were given a sleeker, more rounded look.|$|E
50|$|The Krefeld-Oppum {{station was}} redeveloped up to 2015. The station was {{provided}} with lifts and the platforms were raised {{to ensure a}} <b>stepless</b> access to improve its accessibility. In addition, the station received information display boards and its appearance and its forecourt were upgraded in an urban style. The reconstruction works started on 7 April 2014.|$|E
50|$|In 2008 Valtra {{introduced}} the <b>stepless</b> Direct transmission, {{which it had}} developed and manufactured itself. Unlike other continuously variable transmissions, Direct transmissions have ground-speed PTO option, are equally efficient when driven forwards and in reverse, and have separate oils for the hydraulics and transmission. Direct transmissions are very similar in design to Valtra’s five-step Versu powershift transmissions.|$|E
50|$|These simple {{belt driven}} {{automatic}} transmissions are tuned {{to optimize the}} power curve of a two-stroke engine, constantly keeping the engine at its peak power. One of the key benefits of the CVT {{is that it is}} a <b>stepless</b> transmission. This allows all of the engine's power to be transmitted to the drive wheels at all times.|$|E
