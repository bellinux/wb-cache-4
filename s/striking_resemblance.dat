5|$|Although van der Weyden did not {{adhere to}} the {{conventions}} of idealisation, he generally sought to flatter his sitters. He depicted his models in highly fashionable clothing, often with rounded—almost sculpted—facial features, some of which deviated from natural representation. He adapted his own aesthetic, and his portraits of women often bear a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to each other.|$|E
5|$|Gumbo z'herbes {{may have}} {{originated}} with the French, Germans, or West Africans. It has similarities to the French dish potage aux herbes ("soup with greens"), {{as well as}} to the African callaloo. The meatless dish also bears <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to a dish often eaten in Germany on Maundy Thursday. German Catholics, obeying the Lenten rules, often served a stew made of seven different greens on this date.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} piracy cropped up when a news article {{published}} in The Indian Express exposed {{the dark side of}} the film market. Hardly into weeks of the film's release, CDs were being sold at as low as Rs. 40. Another blemish was that Soumitra Dasgupta, a writer and close associate of Sarkar alleged that the film's story had a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to his parallel work on the novella.|$|E
50|$|In the 16th century, {{visitors}} to India {{became aware of}} similarities between Indian and European languages. For example, Filippo Sassetti reported <b>striking</b> <b>resemblances</b> between Sanskrit and Italian.|$|R

50|$|Mayookham is a 2005 Malayalam film {{starring}} Saiju Kurup and Mamta Mohandas in the lead. The {{film was}} directed by Hariharan. The film has <b>striking</b> <b>resemblances</b> with the Hollywood film A Walk to Remember.|$|R
5|$|The party discovers a Somnia Castle in the “Phantom World” and {{learns that}} the prince is missing {{and that the}} Hero looks like him. They also meet Captain Rusty, who bears a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to Captain Blade. Gaining {{entrance}} to the Moonmirror Tower, the party meets Ashlynn, {{a woman who was}} invisible in the “Phantom World” at first, too, and together they find the Mirror of Ra.|$|E
5|$|As Ko and Aoba {{enter their}} summer break, {{a girl named}} Akane Takigawa with a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to Wakaba moves in next door to Ko. This causes mixed {{feelings}} among the various characters, particularly Ko, Aoba, and Akaishi (who had also liked Wakaba). Akane soon becomes friends with Ko and Tsukishimas, and begins working in the Tsukishima cafe. As another year begins, the romantic subplots further solidify when Yūhei expresses an interest in Aoba. Meanwhile, Seishu gains a new assistant coach {{in the form of}} Yūhei's older brother Junpei, after Ichiyo agrees to marry him if Seishu makes it to Koshien.|$|E
5|$|Cross-linguistically, the-ma suffix may {{be related}} to a coverbial suffix in Jaminjung, a {{language}} in which coverb roots occur without any aspect markers, but are then suffixed with -mayan, which marks continuous aspect. This coverb suffix bears a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to the sum of the Wagiman -ma suffix and the continuous aspect suffix -yan, which always occur in tandem on coverbs. Together, -ma and -yan perform the same semantic function as Jaminjung -mayan. Precisely what the relationship holds between these suffixes; whether one language borrowed from the other, or whether each language inherited them from earlier languages, is not at all clear.|$|E
5000|$|Kathleen Parker {{noted in}} 2008 that a recent New Yorker profile of Roger Stone by Jeffrey Toobin bore <b>striking</b> <b>resemblances</b> {{to a recent}} piece about Stone by Labash. In Parker's view, “any casual reading of the two {{suggests}} that Toobin owed Labash at least a hat tip.” ...|$|R
50|$|Clarence Potter, {{along with}} Tom Colleton, is an {{analogue}} of the Wehrmacht officers who despised Hitler but faithfully served Germany. Potter in particular {{appears to be}} based on Wilhelm Canaris, but his role in the failed attempt on Jake Featherston's life bears <b>striking</b> <b>resemblances</b> to Erwin Rommel's role in the July 20 Plot.|$|R

5|$|In 1991 Christiaan Schuckman {{discovered}} {{a set of}} signed plates in Madrid that {{can be attributed to}} the engraver of the First Folio portrait. These plates bear Droeshout's signature and are stylistically similar to his portrait of Shakespeare. (They include a portrait of the priest and writer Franciso de la Peña that has a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to the English poet). On the evidence of these plates, which were made between 1635 and 1639, Schuckman attributed the portrait of Shakespeare to the younger Martin and suggested that the engraver had converted to Catholicism and emigrated to Spain in 1635, where he continued to work.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been noted that the plot of Cars bears a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to that of Doc Hollywood, the 1991 romantic comedy which stars Michael J. Fox as a hotshot young doctor, who, after causing a traffic {{accident}} in a small town, is sentenced {{to work at the}} town hospital, {{falls in love with a}} local law student and eventually acquires an appreciation for small town values. Some have gone so far as to say that the makers of Cars plagiarized the script of Doc Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|The Tempest {{may take}} its overall {{structure}} from traditional Italian commedia dell'arte, which sometimes featured a magus and his daughter, their supernatural attendants, {{and a number}} of rustics. The commedia often featured a clown known as Arlecchino (or his predecessor, Zanni) and his partner Brighella, who bear a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to Stephano and Trinculo; a lecherous Neapolitan hunchback who corresponds to Caliban; and the clever and beautiful Isabella, whose wealthy and manipulative father, Pantalone, constantly seeks a suitor for her, thus mirroring the relationship between Miranda and Prospero.|$|E

40|$|The Mariner 10 {{encounter}} of Mercury provided data {{showing a}} stron {{interaction between the}} solar wind and the planet similar to a scaled down version of that producing the earth's magnetosphere. Some of the features observed in Mercury's night side magnetosphere suggest time-dependent processes occurring there. Interpreted as temporal events, these features bear <b>striking</b> <b>resemblances</b> to substorm phenomena in the earth's magnetosphere...|$|R
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} conducted unearthed square or circular Chera coins made {{of copper}} from near Cochin. This {{was for the}} first time, from a stratographic context, coins of Sangam Chera period {{have been found in}} Kerala. The coin, which is almost a square in shape, has an elephant facing to the right and some symbols towards the top of the coin. The symbols could not be identified as {{the upper part of the}} coin was partially corroded. A drawn bow and arrow was visible on the other side. Below the arrow is an elephant goad (a prod used to control elephants). These coins bear a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to the ones excavated from Karur in Tamil Nadu, said the archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts II Final Mixs secret ending {{features}} a character named Ventus who bears a strong <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to him. Nomura commented that, despite their similarities, Roxas and Ventus {{are not the}} same character. He also said that when playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, players will be able to distinguish Roxas from Ventus. In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such a connection. For the upcoming game Kingdom Hearts III, there is a possibility of Roxas being revived despite Sora being alive at the same time. Nomura says this will be {{explained by the fact that}} the character Xehanort whose Heartless and Nobody, Ansem and Xemnas, exist at the same time as the original one.|$|E
5|$|Another {{defense that}} often uses color or shape to deceive {{potential}} enemies is mimicry. A number of longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) bear a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to wasps, which helps them avoid predation {{even though the}} beetles are in fact harmless. Batesian and Müllerian mimicry complexes are commonly found in Lepidoptera. Genetic polymorphism and natural selection give rise to otherwise edible species (the mimic) gaining a survival advantage by resembling inedible species (the model). Such a mimicry complex {{is referred to as}} Batesian and is most commonly known by the mimicry by the limenitidine viceroy butterfly of the inedible danaine monarch. Later research has discovered that the viceroy is, in fact more toxic than the monarch and this resemblance should be considered as a case of Müllerian mimicry. In Müllerian mimicry, inedible species, usually within a taxonomic order, find it advantageous to resemble each other so as to reduce the sampling rate by predators who need to learn about the insects' inedibility. Taxa from the toxic genus Heliconius form one of the most well known Müllerian complexes.|$|E

50|$|The {{school has}} been used as a setting for several novels {{including}} Louis Auchincloss' Rector of Justin (1964). Curtis Sittenfeld's Prep (2005) has prompted speculation that the fictitious Ault School, the main setting of the novel, is in fact Groton School, as they bear <b>striking</b> <b>resemblances</b> and Sittenfeld herself attended Groton. Media coverage of the school came in the spring of 1999, when three Groton seniors alleged they and other students had been sexually abused by students in dormitories in 1996 and 1997.|$|R
5|$|He {{examines}} {{in detail}} the expression of evolutionary stages {{in the development of}} embryos, tracing from the process of cell division to the development of specific anatomical features. He finds a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> between the embryonic development of reptiles and birds, including details of the skeletal anatomy (with special attention to the hands and feet) and various organs. He notes that bird and reptile embryos develop visceral arches, hinting at their aquatic ancestry. Of more interest to his goal, Heilmann writes in a similar vein that the embryos of certain birds clearly show a three-clawed finger structure, at least one of which (the hoatzin) retains actual claws after hatching. He mentions other anatomical features of bird embryos that hint at their reptilian ancestry as well, such as the embryonic splitting of the pygostyle into distinct separate vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|The club crest {{has been}} a rampant lion since 1936, which was also {{introduced}} by Charlie Hewitt. There have been many variations of the lion; {{the first was a}} single red lion, often mistakenly said to be chosen because of the club's Scottish roots. The lion bore a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to signs used by pubs named The Red Lion. From 1956 to 1974 Millwall's crest was two leaping red lions facing each other. Former chairman Theo Paphitis brought back the badge in 1999, where it was used for a further eight years. The current crest is a leaping lion, which first appeared on a Millwall kit in 1979. It remained until 1999 and was re-introduced again in 2007. The club mascot is a giant lion called Zampa, so named after Zampa Road, the postal address of The Den.|$|E
5|$|Scully visits Kresge, {{wanting to}} look further into Roberta Sim's suicide, {{despite the fact}} that the police think it is a simple suicide. Scully finds a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> between the Sims' daughter, Emily, and her sister Melissa from when she was that age. Scully flashes back to a funeral she {{attended}} when she was a little girl but imagines Marshall Sim holding her hand. Scully insists on performing an autopsy on Roberta, thinking that she was murdered. Scully finds a needle puncture in Roberta's foot, causing her to believe that she was anesthetized and her suicide was staged. The police search the Sim's house and find a used hypodermic needle, which Marshall claims was used for injecting the anemic Emily with treatment. Scully spots the dark-suited men watching from a nearby car. Scully receives DNA data on Melissa, and matching it up to Emily's finds them nearly identical, causing her to believe that Emily is Melissa's daughter. Scully believes that Melissa gave birth to her while on the west coast and gave her up for adoption without ever telling the rest of the family. Scully flashes back to when she and Melissa were teenagers and were given cross necklaces from their mother for Christmas.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} Ukelle is still sketchy. Some argue that their {{ancestors}} moved downwards from Benue state, others {{contend that the}} ancestors may have moved from the Igbo country. Ukelle people share sociocultural similarities with the neighbouring Igede people of Benue state and Yala people of Cross River state. Major ceremonies such as marriage, burials and dances bear <b>striking</b> <b>resemblances.</b> Ukelle people refer to Yala people as Ollah, Igede people as Ollah-ewoh and the Idoma people of Benue state as Ollah-akpoto.|$|R
5000|$|Indonesian Production House SinemArt's drama, titled Buku Harian Nayla (Nayla's Diary), plagiarizes 1 Litre of Tears.

40|$|There {{are many}} respects in which Bolzano and Frege are close {{philosophical}} allies. In {{the first part}} of this paper I shall compare their conceptions of a grounding proof and of an axiom. I shall emphasize <b>striking</b> <b>resemblances,</b> but I am at least as keen to underline some philosophically important differences beneath those similarities. In the second part I shall discuss the vexing question of whether Bolzano had any influence on Frege by commenting on Frege’s excursion into metalogic and on both philosophers’ aversion against indirect proofs...|$|R
5|$|Temples {{built in}} and around the Kalyani region (in the Bidar district) were quite {{different}} from those built in other regions. Without exception, the articulation was nagara, and the temple plan as a rule was either stepped-diamond or stellate. The elevations corresponding to these two plans were similar because star shapes were produced by rotating the corner projections of a standard stepped plan in increments of 11.25 degrees, resulting in a 32-pointed interrupted plan in which three star points are skipped in the centre of each side of the shrine. Examples of stepped-diamond plans surviving in Karnataka are the Dattatreya Temple at Chattarki, the Someshvara Temple in Kadlewad, and the Mallikarjuna and Siddhesvara at Kalgi in the Gulbarga district. The nagara shrine at Chattarki is a stepped diamond of projecting corners with five projections per side. Because of the stepped-diamond plan, the wall pillars have two fully exposed sides, with a high base block decorated with a mirrored stalk motif and two large wall images above. The shapes and decorations {{on the rest of the}} wall pillar have a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> to the actual pillars supporting the ceiling.|$|E

50|$|In many temples, the {{depiction}} {{is in the}} form of half fish or seal with head of an elephant. It is also shown with head and jaws resembling a crocodile, an elephant trunk with scales of fish and a peacock tail. Other accounts identify it with Gangetic Dolphin having <b>striking</b> <b>resemblances</b> with the latter, now found mainly in Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary. Others portray it as a fish body with an elephant's head. The tradition identifies the makara with water, the source of all existence and fertility.|$|R
25|$|The Nashi {{form one}} of the 56 ethnic groups officially {{recognized}} by the People's Republic of China. The official Chinese government classification includes the Mosuo {{as part of the}} Nashi people, although neither ethnicity support this categorization. Although both groups are descendents of the Qiang people, together with the Pumi and Yi, and notwithstanding very <b>striking</b> <b>resemblances</b> between their respective languages, the two groups are now understood to be culturally distinct, the Nakhi more influenced by the very patriarchal Han Chinese culture, the Mosuo more influenced by Tibetan culture and their own matriarchal family practices.|$|R
