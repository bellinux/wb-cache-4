The Layout Key facilitates the exchange of information between the various parties involved in a commercial transaction and is {{used as the basis}} for many key trade documents such as the European Union’s <b>Single</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Document</b> (SAD); FIATA’s Freight Forwarding Instruction; UNECE’s Dangerous Goods Declaration; and the World Customs Organization (WCO) Goods Declaration for Export.

40|$|Customs is one domain {{which has}} faced {{the need for}} {{information}} systems in a globalizing world. In customs {{there is a need}} for close collaboration between business and government in order to build robust technological infrastructures supporting processes related to export and import of goods. This has led to a move towards eCustoms. This case study reports from a longitudinal study of a Danish exporter which has faced the challenges of implementing eCustoms in its daily operations. The introduction of eCustoms to replace the existing customs infrastructure based on the <b>Single</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Document</b> (SAD) has led to new challenges for the Danish exporter such as destandardized procedures and increased reporting. The particular contribution of the study is the observed longing to the “good old paper-based days ” where things were more standardized than after the digitalization of the processes. The study is interpreted through the lens of “double infrastructures”. The underlying assumption guiding the study is that eCustoms represents one infrastructure on top of another well established infrastructure of global trade...|$|E
40|$|The Rotterdam Convention {{that was}} signed in Rotterdam on 10 September 1998 and entered into force on 24 February 2004 regroups {{currently}} 154 Parties. It introduced the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in International trade. The convention aims to promote shared responsibility and cooperative effort among Parties {{in order to protect}} {{human health and the environment}} from potential harm and to contribute to their environmentally sound use, by facilitating information exchange about their characteristics, by providing for a national decision-making process on their import and export and by disseminating these decisions to Parties. The European Union adopted the Rotterdam Convention by Council Decision 2006 / 730 /EC of 25 September 2006. Furthermore, Regulation (EC) No 689 / 2008 of the European Parliament and the Council of 17 June 2008 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals is the latest in a series of measures over the years that seek to address international trade with dangerous chemicals. This Regulation reaffirms the EU commitment towards ensuring proper control in the trade and use of dangerous chemicals at the global level, based on the principle that it should help to protect human health and the environment beyond its borders as well as within. Two linked processes were identified as characterising the PIC content management activities. They are analysed separately: the export notifications process and the explicit consents process. The export notifications process aims to identify uniquely the <b>single</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>document</b> clearing customs. The explicit consents process aims to explicitly exchange risk management information, between an exporting designated national authority and an importing one, prior to export of chemicals. Each process is first described. The functionalities supporting the process are listed and explained. The specific implication of the administrator in the process is then identified. Finally the liaison between both processes is analysed. Several working documents are annexed in order to transparently manage the hand over of the PIC content management activities to the European Chemicals Agency - ECHA. JRC.

40|$|The <b>administrative</b> <b>document</b> in Yüan China {{was widely}} used among {{government}} organizations including those for religious affairs. The different official rank {{of the administration}} decided the different style, pattern {{and nature of the}} <b>administrative</b> <b>document.</b> The top Taoist management in Yüan China was Academy of Scholarly Worthies 集賢院, which operated three subsidiary bodies : the Taoist Administration (諸路道敎所), the Jiangnan Taoist Administration (江南諸路道敎所) and the Jianghuai-Jingxiang Taoist Administration (江淮荊襄道敎總攝所). They were respectively supported by Quanzhen, Xuan and Zhengyi sect of Taoism. Under the supervision of these administrations, there were lots of territorial Taoist registries such as Dao-lu si (道錄司), Dao-zheng si (道正司) and Wei-yi si (威儀司) throughout the empire. The Taoist administrations at all levels had their own official ranks correspond to the government organizations, which forms the applying basis of the <b>administrative</b> <b>document</b> in Taoist area. Official Permit over Chengtian Taoist Temple (承天觀公據) and Inscription of Decree on Hereditary Abbot of Lingying Taoist Temple (靈應觀甲乙住持劄付碑) are the detailed Taoist <b>administrative</b> <b>document</b> we have ever seen. By analysis of the content, we can see how the system of <b>administrative</b> <b>document</b> was used in Taoist area in Yüan China. And of course, according to the disputes over the right of ownership of Taoist temples recorded in the documents, we can also find out a miniature for the Secularizing Process of Religious World in Yüan China...|$|R
