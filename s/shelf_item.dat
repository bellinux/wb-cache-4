40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA methodology for solar energy system design improvement {{has been developed}} and coupled with a constrained function optimization code resulting in an automated solar energy system design procedure. The scope of the methodology is limited to systems using flat plate collectors and water as the working fluid. Eight parameters have been included as independent design variables. The design variables included collector area, collector tile angle, collector and storage fluid stream velocities, and collector to storage heat exchanger dimensions. The procedure includes an accounting for economic parameters as an intimate part of the design process. The resulting methodology {{has been used for}} the design of solar energy systems which would use <b>shelf</b> <b>item</b> collectors for the purposes of determining the optimum design variable vector for a given situation. The methodology could also be used on a limited basis for collector design optimization by exploring the effects of changing selected collector parameters on system performance. The methodology is coded in the FORTRAN computer language under the name SOLCAD- 1 (SOLAR ENERGY OPTIMIZATION ANALYSIS OR DESIGN). Initial system trials indicate complete stability with minimal constraint activations. Eased on the results of approximately fifty design experiments using SOLDAD- 1, new findings concerning optimum collector tilt angle and an invariant optimum collector flow factor are suggested.

30|$|Display {{orientation}} also impacts {{the stock}} per facing since more or fewer units of an item fit behind one facing {{depending on whether}} the item is positioned length- or crosswise. In Fig.  1, fewer units would fit behind one facing lengthwise and more units behind a facing with crosswise display orientation. The stock that can be placed behind one facing is determined by the depth of the <b>shelf</b> and the <b>item</b> dimensions. Since the space behind one facing is always filled completely after a replenishment (i.e., filled up until the shelf depth is fully occupied), the stock per facing is not itself a decision of the retailer, but is determined via <b>shelf</b> and <b>item</b> dimensions as well as the decision on the display orientation.|$|R

The following discussion follows the categories listed above in providing an overview of major resources in the field—including the areas of music publishing, licensing, recording, merchandising, concert promotion, artist management, and arts administration—and is intended to be used as an introductory guide to research.

Finding Books There are two basic approaches commonly used to find books and scores in the Library at Columbia College Chicago. When looking for specific materials—an item with a known author, title or subject, for example—you would normally search the Library Catalog of books and audiovisual materials to locate the number identifying the particular item(s) you need. The Library Catalog is available from public computer workstations located on every floor of the library.

50|$|In retail terms, a go-back is {{an item of}} {{merchandise}} which must be placed back on the store <b>shelves.</b> Such <b>items</b> usually accumulate during the store's open hours, and comprise a combination of returned items, items customers {{have decided not to}} purchase, and items store employees may have found left lying on the wrong shelf. Go-backs can often accumulate over several days because businesses, especially larger department stores, tend to have other priorities at the time and not enough employment to put the go-backs away. Go-backs are sometimes referred to as re-shop, put-backs, misplaced, shop-backs, returns, abandons, left-behinds, loose-stock, or shop-downs.|$|R

In this problem, we are given bins of capacity 1, and n items of Q different classes, each item e with class c(e) and size s(e). The problem is to pack the items into bins, such that two items of different classes packed in a same bin must be in different <b>shelves.</b> <b>Items</b> in a same shelf are packed consecutively. Moreover, <b>items</b> in consecutive <b>shelves</b> must be separated by shelf divisors of size d. In a shelf bin packing problem, we have to obtain a shelf packing such that the total size of <b>items</b> and <b>shelf</b> divisors in any bin is at most 1. A dual approximation scheme must obtain a shelf packing of all items into N bins, such that, the total size of all <b>items</b> and <b>shelf</b> divisors packed in any bin is at most 1 + epsilon for a given epsilon > 0 and N {{is the number of}} bins used in an optimum shelf bin packing problem.

In doing so, they must decide how much shelf space to allocate to which <b>item.</b> Because <b>shelf</b> quantities assigned to retail shelves become depleted over time due to customer purchases, retailers need to regularly refill <b>shelves</b> and reorder <b>items.</b> Reordering directly impacts replenishment processes. As soon as reorders arrive at the store, the respective items are transported to the showroom, where shelves are replenished (i.e., direct replenishment). As a result, every order process triggers a direct replenishment process. Items that do not fit onto the showroom shelf space are stored in the backroom, from where shelves are later replenished (i.e., indirect replenishment from backroom).|$|R

30|$|When retail shelf {{space is}} limited, {{retailers}} need to thoroughly consider the trade-off between shelf-space and ordering decisions. The two decisions are interdependent and impact in-store logistics processes for shelf replenishment, since every order triggers direct replenishment of <b>shelves</b> and since <b>items</b> {{that do not}} fit onto the showroom shelf must be indirectly replenished from the backroom. Despite these interdependencies in in-store logistics and space assignment, an integrated optimization model is lacking in the existing literature. The contributions on shelf-space planning mentioned all focus on optimizing the number of facings. Demand {{is assumed to be}} facing-dependent (i.e., space-elastic). Non-linearities arising from this are dealt with either via linear approximations or solution heuristics that are limited in their capability to solve instances of practice-relevant size.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Through an {{experiment}} in a virtual environment, in this work we studied the relationship between vertical and horizontal shelf location and {{the frequency with which}} shoppers select items. We tested a random distribution hypothesis of the picking up frequencies (PUFs) in relationship to <b>item</b> <b>shelf</b> position within {{an experiment}}al framework with various constant hypothesized confounding variables. The equidistribution hypothesis was rejected in a test with 600 virtual shoppers, providing evidence for the existence of a gravitational force towards certain shelf locations. In particular, the PUFs resulted significantly higher for eye-level and waist-level locations when items were placed {{in the first half of}} the virtual gondola. On a theoretical level, our experiment also shows that the minimal physical effort principle is probably not a good explanation for the qualitative heterogeneity of shelf space and for the associated shelf position effects.
