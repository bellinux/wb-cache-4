5|$|The {{radioisotope}} 16N is {{the dominant}} radionuclide in the coolant of pressurised water reactors or boiling water reactors during normal operation, and thus it is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the primary coolant system to the secondary <b>steam</b> <b>cycle,</b> and is the primary means of detection for such leaks. It is produced from 16O (in water) via an (n,p) reaction in which the 16O atom captures a neutron and expels a proton. It has a short half-life of about 7.1 s, but during its decay back to 16O produces high-energy gamma radiation (5 to 7MeV). Because of this, access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurised water reactor must be restricted during reactor power operation.|$|E
5|$|Water {{used in the}} <b>steam</b> <b>cycle</b> {{is taken}} from the local mains water, {{supplied}} by Northumbrian Water. Up to 300,000 tons of mains water per year {{is used in the}} station, however it has to be cleaned of impurities before use. This is done at an on site water treatment plant that uses a process of ion exchange to remove impurities such as silica and control PH levels so as to avoid boiler tube corrosion. This treated water is used to make superheated steam in the coal-fired boilers, that will turn the turbines before being recovered in the condenser and reused.|$|E
5|$|For {{creating}} the steam to turn steam turbines and generate electricity, and for cooling the steam coming {{away from the}} turbines, water is needed, and is thus beneficial to have near any thermal power station. The cooling water that {{is used in the}} Lynemouth power station is taken from a body of water located close to the plant, the North Sea. The water is transferred from the sea to the plant by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three condensers (one per each generating set) in the interior of the power station, which are used to cool the heated water before it is reused in the <b>steam</b> <b>cycle.</b> The cooling water is then transferred back to the North Sea.|$|E

A theoretical comparison between different bottoming cycles producing heat for a typical Scandinavian district heating network has been carried out. The Kalina cycle, the Rankine cycle with a mixture of ammonia and water as the working fluid and the normal single pressure <b>steam</b> Rankine <b>cycle</b> are compared.

40|$|The use of N 204 as {{the working}} fluid in gas turbine power cycles is {{recognized}} as a potential instrument for improving cycle efficiency at moderate top temperatures while maintaining the technical advantages connected with the waste heat rejection at a comparatively high average temperature.

The thermodynamic reasons which explain the peculiar behaviour of N 204 as the Brayton cycle working fluid are discussed. With respect to inert gas cycles, N 204 permits, for a given efficiency, a reduction in turbine inlet temperature by 200 - 250 °C.
