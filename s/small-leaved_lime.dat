25|$|The reserve, {{in northeastern}} Poland, lies {{adjacent}} to the Belovezhskaya Pushcha Biosphere Reserve in Belarus. The forest complex, the last and largest remaining mixed deciduous primeval forest on the North European Plain, is situated in the transition between the hemiboreal and continental climate areas. The forest is composed of a mosaic of diverse communities, principally composed of grey willow (Salix cinerea), European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), arctic dwarf birch (Betula humilis) English oak (Quercus robur), <b>small-leaved</b> <b>lime</b> (Tilia cordata), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce (Picea abies), which reaches its southern limits in the northern hemisphere here, and sessile oak (Quercus petraea), which reaches its northeastern limit here.|$|E
25|$|Pine forests (with Pinus sylvestris) are {{the most}} {{widespread}} and occupy 51% of the forested area of the Karelian Isthmus, followed by spruce forests (with Picea abies, 29%) and birch forests (with Betula pendula and B. pubescens, 16%). Stands on more fertile soils and in more favorable locations are occasionally dominated by Norway maple, black alder, grey alder, common aspen, English oak, grey willow, dark-leaved willow, tea-leaved willow, <b>small-leaved</b> <b>lime</b> or European white elm. Common vegetation of various types of pine forests includes heather, crowberry, common juniper, eared willow, lingonberry, water horsetail, bracken, graminoids (i.e. grasses in the wider sense) Avenella flexuosa and Carex globularis, mosses Pleurozium schreberi, Sphagnum angustifolium and S. russowii, and lichens Cladonia spp. Prominent in various spruce forests are wood horsetail, common wood sorrel, bilberry, lingonberry, graminoids Avenella flexuosa, Calamagrostis arundinacea, Carex globularis, and mosses Polytrichum commune and Sphagnum girgensohnii. Prominent vegetation of various birch forests include meadowsweet, common wood sorrel, bilberry and graminoids Calamagrostis arundinacea and C. canescens.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the causative agent {{of a disease}} outbreak affecting <b>small-leaved</b> <b>limes</b> (Tilia cordata Mill.) and resulting in darkening of the leaf petioles and excessive defoliation during summer 2016 in southern Finland. The fungal species composition of the symptomatic petioles was examined by culture isolation and molecular identification using ITS rDNA sequences, which revealed the most prevalent fungal species present in the petioles as Apiognomonia errabunda (Roberge) Hhn. Based on reviewing curated herbarium specimens deposited at the Universities of Helsinki and Turku, A. errabunda is native and widely distributed in <b>small-leaved</b> <b>limes</b> in Finland, and occasionally infects also other broadleaved trees, including Quercus robur L. and ornamental species of Tilia L. and Fagus L. The ITS sequence analysis conducted during this study revealed minor within-species polymorphisms similar to those observed earlier in the Central European and Russian populations of A. errabunda, and reports the first nucleotide sequences of this species from the Nordic countries...|$|R
50|$|From {{the village}} of Kloster over the Hucke to the tourist cafe of Zum Klausner in the Tannengrund valley is a mixed wood of Scots pine, beech, English oak, hornbeam, wild cherry, Swedish whitebeam, {{sycamore}} maple and Norway maple. In the west - on the former clifftop dunes - field maple, hawthorn, silver birch, hazel, willows, roses, fly honeysuckle, buckthorn, blackthorn (sloe), spindle and alpine currant are mainly found. North of Kloster, {{in the area of}} the old bird ornithological station, there are a few large- and <b>small-leaved</b> <b>limes</b> as well as hybrids of both species. Old man's beard, common hop, common polypody, false brome, common twayblade, which has become extremely rare on Hiddensee, and common moonwort, as well as the still common broad-leaved helleborine form an undergrowth. Early bloomers are e. g. wood violet, lesser celandine und ivy-leaved speedwell. The rich orchid communities, for which Hiddensee was formerly well-known have, however, disappeared.|$|R

500|$|To {{the north}} of the river bank {{northwest}} of Langport are the Aller and Beer Woods and Aller Hill biological Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Aller and Beer Woods is a Somerset Wildlife Trust reserve. It consists of large blocks of semi-natural ancient woodland along the west-facing slope of Aller Hill, overlooking King's Sedgemoor. The reserve is about [...] and the underlying geology of most of it is Lias limestone. Prior to the 20thcentury it appears to have been managed for centuries as traditional coppice woodland, and it provides an outstanding example of ancient escarpment woodland. The woodland is a variant of the calcareous ash/wych elm stand-type, with pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) the dominant canopy trees throughout, and with scattered concentrations of wych elm (Ulmus glabra). Ancient woodland indicators include <b>small-leaved</b> <b>lime</b> (Tilia cordata), and wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis), both of which are locally common. Plants of particular interest include bird's nest orchid (Neottia nidus-avis), greater butterfly orchid (Platanthera chlorantha) and the very rare Red Data Book species purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum). Aller Hill contains three species of plant which are nationally rare and a further three which are of restricted distribution in Somerset. The central area contains a sward dominated by sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) in combination with yellow oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens) and quaking-grass (Briza media). Salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor) forms a major component of the sward with the two nationally rare species rough marsh-mallow (Althaea hirsuta) and nit-grass (Gastridium ventricosum), also present.|$|E

40|$|Wooded {{pasture and}} older forest with dead trees, about 10 % {{of an area}} of 3000 ha in {{the central part of}} the parish of Stenbrohult, was {{inventoried}} for wood-living beetles in 1985 - 2002. In the study areas Carl Linnaeus was born in 1707, and he spent his summers there until 1728. All standard methods for finding wood-beetles were used, including many window traps and 170 wood mould samples. As a new method, from 1992 and later, fragments in wood mould in hollow trees were collected and determined to species in the laboratory. We found 74 red-listed wood-beetles, including 13 threatened species (categories EN and VU). The highest numbers of threatened wood-beetles were found on properties owned by the church or by the largest landowners. This was because old (> 150 years), southern deciduous trees were largely absent on small farm properties. Recorded habitats in the study area for the red-listed species are given. Old hollow oaks Quercus robur, beeches Fagus sylvatica, <b>small-leaved</b> <b>limes</b> Tilia cordata, elms Ulmus glabra and big dead birches Betula spp. were the most important substrates for threatened species in the study area. These substrates, mainly old living trees but also standing dead trees, are also crucial habitats for species listed as possibly globally threatened and found in the study area: Corticeus fasciatus, Ptenidium gressneri, Plectophloeus nitidus, Oxypoda arborea, Gnorimus nobilis, Ampedus hjorti, Athous mutilatus, Procraerus tibialis, Xylophilus corticalis, Grynocharis oblonga, Cryptophagus fuscicornis, C. labilis, Latridius brevicollis, Mycetophagus populi, Hypulus quercinus. Mycetochara axillaris. Phloeophagus lignarius and P. thomsoni. Threats to the long-term survival of the red-listed species are discussed. The need for rapid habitat restoration to lower the "extinction debt" is stressed. This is especially urgent for features that have declined most since Linnaeus time, e. g. old sun-exposed oaks and other southern deciduous trees. The number of big dead spruces has probably increased in recent decades, and therefore species dependent on spruce are unlikely to be part of the extinction debt...|$|R
