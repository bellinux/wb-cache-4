40|$|OBJECTIVE: Interventional targets may be {{virtually}} "excluded" due to vascular access problems or complex previous surgical procedures. This study reviews our experience using transapical ventricular puncture to gain {{direct access to}} the systemic ventricle. PATIENTS: Patient 1 (74 years, 2 previous <b>sternotomies),</b> patient 2 (66 years, 5 previous <b>sternotomies),</b> and patient 5 (69 years, 3 previous <b>sternotomies)</b> with prosthetic valves had paravalvular mitral valve leaks. Patient 3 (6. 3 years, 2 previous <b>sternotomies)</b> with an extracardiac Fontan conduit, had a significant residual leak after two previous surgical attempts of patch closure of a severely regurgitant right atrioventricular valve. Patient 4 (10 months) had failure of standard ablation of the posteroseptal region of the mitral valve with persistent life-threatening episodes of ventricular tachycardia. METHODS: Procedures were performed under general anesthesia. Entry site was percutaneous in three patients and in two (and one conversion) a mini-thoracotomy was used. Sheaths were placed (6 F) using standard Seldinger technique, followed by the procedure as required. Direct surgical closure of the puncture site was done in 4 patients and in patient 3, a percutaneous vascular occlusion device was used. RESULTS: Easy and immediate access was obtained in all patients. The paravalvular leaks were crossed within seconds and completely closed with Amplatzer occluders. In patient 3 the valve was crossed using a Brokenbrough needle and a 12 -mm Amplatzer device was placed in the patch leak. Patient 4 was successfully ablated using a 7 -F irrigated catheter endo- and epicardially. Complications were in the percutaneous puncture group: in one patient a coronary artery was punctured and in one a hemothorax developed. CONCLUSION: Direct left ventricular puncture offers a very useful alternative access site in selected patients to reach "inaccessible" targets for certain percutaneous interventions in patients where standard approaches may be impossible or difficult. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveComorbidities predisposing cardiac {{surgical}} patients toward deep sternal wound infection, such as {{diabetes and}} obesity, are rising in the United States. Longitudinal analysis of risk factors, morbidity, and mortality was performed to assessed effects of these health trends on deep sternal wound infection rates. MethodsIn this retrospective analysis of all median <b>sternotomies</b> performed at a single institution from 1991 through 2006, demographic and surgical characteristics were identified from a prospective database. The cohort was separated into periods from 1992 through 2001 and 2002 through 2006 to identify longitudinal trends in risk factors for deep sternal wound infection. Univariate and matched multivariable analyses were performed. ResultsOverall, study population had increased comorbidities associated with deep sternal wound infection such as obesity, diabetes, and advanced age. Deep sternal wound infections were treated in 285 of 21, 000 <b>sternotomies</b> performed during study period (1. 35 %). Deep sternal wound infection rates decreased from 1. 57 % to 0. 88 % in last 5 years. Rate of deep sternal wound infection was reduced among patients with diabetes from 3. 2 % to 1. 0 %. Multivariable analysis showed diabetes and smoking to be eliminated as risk factors in last 5 years. Prolonged bypass time was the only variable independently associated with deep sternal wound infection for the entire period. Thirty-day and 1 -year mortalities for deep sternal wound infection did not change significantly. ConclusionsAnalysis of a large series of cardiac surgical patients demonstrates significant reduction in deep sternal wound infection incidence in 15 years. Introduction of perioperative intravenous insulin may explain some observed risk reduction. Efforts should focus on prevention, because mortality remains elevated...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{sought to}} examine the {{frequency}} of early postoperative complications and preoperative predictors of prolonged hospitalization in adults with repaired tetralogy of Fallot undergoing pulmonary valve replacement. MethodsThis was a retrospective study of consecutive adult patients undergoing surgical intervention between 1995 and 2006. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify determinants of prolonged hospitalization. ResultsOne hundred sixteen patients (mean age, 36 ± 11 years) underwent 118 pulmonary valve replacements. Most (95 %) operations included additional procedures, such as pulmonary artery/outflow tract reconstruction or tricuspid valve annuloplasty. The early postoperative mortality (< 30 days) was 2. 5 %. The majority of the patients (60 %) had no postoperative complications. The postoperative adverse events included postoperative arrhythmias (19 %), respiratory complications (13 %), reoperation during admission (13 %), renal dysfunction (13 %), and myocardial infarction (3 %). Postoperative adverse events were associated with prolonged hospitalization (14 ± 12 vs 7 ± 3 days, P =. 001). In the multivariate analysis age at reoperation of greater than 45 years (odds ratio, 6. 1; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 6 – 23. 6; P =. 009), the number of previous <b>sternotomies</b> (odds ratio, 3. 8; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 4 – 10; P =. 007), {{and the need for}} urgent surgical intervention (odds ratio, 5. 7; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 1 – 27. 8; P =. 03) were predictors of prolonged hospitalization. ConclusionPulmonary valve replacement in adults with repaired tetralogy of Fallot has a low mortality risk. The most common early postoperative complications are arrhythmias and respiratory and renal complications. Although most early postoperative complications do not result in long-term sequelae, they are associated with prolonged hospitalization. Patients undergoing urgent interventions, older patients, and those with multiple previous <b>sternotomies</b> are at the highest risk for prolonged hospitalization...|$|R
40|$|Among a {{consecutive}} {{series of}} 9, 279 <b>sternotomies</b> performed {{during a period}} of 2 ½ years, 61 (0. 66 %) patients developed significant wound complications. Of these, 58 (95. 1 %) survived. Sternal infection occurred in 36 patients (0. 39 %). Predisposing factors included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, closed chest massage, prolonged assisted ventilation, and excessive bleeding after operation. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) did not, in itself, predispose to sternal dehiscence. Intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) treatments caused excessive coughing, which may have increased the likelihood of dehiscence.

All tumors were considered nonresectable after first staging, and patients were treated with the following chemotherapy in 4 -day courses, administered intravenously: cisplatin (50 mg/m 2) and doxorubicin (40 mg/m 2) on day 1, vincristine (0. 6 mg/m 2) on day 3, and cyclophosphamide (700 mg/m 2) on day 4. The courses were repeated every 3 weeks, and toxic effects were well tolerated. Seven patients (43 %) had a complete remission, and nine patients (57 %) had a partial remission, with an overall complete remission plus partial remission rate of 100 %. After chemotherapy all patients underwent operation. We performed 12 <b>sternotomies</b> and four posterolateral thoracotomies.

40|$|Background. Patients with {{penetrating}} cardiac injuries may {{be stable}} or only mildly shocked, {{especially if the}} laceration has sealed off and the patient has been aggressively resuscitated. Clinical signs, chest roentgenograms, pericardiocentesis, and subxiphoid window are not always helpful in establishing the diagnosis. We reflect on the current evaluation based on 128 patients. Methods. There were four groups of patients, ranging from lifeless (group I) to stable (group IV). Patients in groups I and II were prepared immediately for operation. Those in groups III and IV were often investigated further (chest roentgenogram and cardiac ultrasound). Results. Mortality was 8 %. Significant findings were a precordial stab, central venous pressure of more than 15 cm of water, one or more clinical signs of tamponade, and initial shock. Cardiac ultrasound was performed in 5 patients in group II (15 %), 14 patients in group III (48 %), and 37 patients in group IV (86 %). There were no false positives, and 6 false negatives (11 %). Thirty-one patients (24 %) had clotted lacerations. There were no negative <b>sternotomies.</b> Conclusions. Efficient fluid resuscitation and rapid confirmation of diagnosis with cardiac ultrasound should decrease mortality. Stable patients with a precordial wound should undergo cardiac ultrasound or echocardiogram.

This communication describes the short-term results of perventricular device closure of muscular ventricular septal defects with the heart beating in 8 children with 15 muscular ventricular septal defects, with or without other congenital malformations. MethodsA subxiphoid minimally invasive incision was used in 3 children with isolated muscular ventricular septal defects whereas standard full median <b>sternotomies</b> were used in the other 5 children who required subsequent correction of coexisting malformations. Under the continuous guidance of transesophageal echocardiography, the free wall of the right ventricle was punctured, and a guidewire was introduced into the left ventricle through the defect. A delivery sheath was advanced over the wire and through the defect into the left ventricle. The device was released. ResultsA total of 14 muscular ventricular septal defects were successfully closed perventricularly without cardiopulmonary bypass. There was no mortality perioperatively or during the entire follow-up period. At 6 -month follow-up, there was no detectable residual shunt, arrhythmia, or new mitral or tricuspid insufficiency. Other than 5 children with the coexisting malformations, none of the other children required any blood or blood products. The average hospital stay was 7. 9 ± 2. 2 days (range, 5 – 11 days).

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the contribution of unifocalization procedures {{in the management of}} patients with pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect, and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries. MethodsFrom 1975 through 1995, 82 consecutive patients were entered in a multistage approach and had 189 <b>sternotomies</b> and thoracotomies to perform 119 shunts, 130 major aortopulmonary collateral artery transplantations, and 76 major aortopulmonary collateral artery ligations. The serial angiographies and the follow-up of these patients were reviewed. ResultsThe concurrent follow-up rate was 80 %. The hospital mortality of the preliminary procedures was 4 % (7 / 189). Fifty-three (65 %) patients had a complete repair. The hospital mortality of the repair was 8 % (4 / 53), and 9 late deaths occurred after repair, all of which were cardiac related. The overall survival of all patients to the age of 30 years was 58 % ± 7 %. Survival 12 years after complete repair was 51 % ± 14 %. On angiography, central shunts promoted growth of central pulmonary arteries in all cases (29 patients). Sixty unifocalized major aortopulmonary collateral arteries were identified in 31 patients. After a mean of 3. 2 ± 4 years, 26 thrombosed, and 12 presented with a stenosis of greater than 50 %. Serial measurements of 29 major aortopulmonary collateral arteries showed no signs of growth (P =. 25). ConclusionLong-term survival into adulthood of patients with pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect, and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries has been achieved with a multistage approach.

This study sought to examine outcome and its predictors for ACHD cardiac surgery. Methods This is an observational cohort study of prospectively collected data on 1090 consecutive adult patients with CHD, undergoing 1130 cardiac operations for CHD at the Royal Brompton Hospital between 2002 and 2011. Early mortality was the primary outcome measure. Midterm to longer-term survival, cumulative incidence of reoperation, other interventions and/or new-onset arrhythmia were secondary outcome measures. Predictors of early/total mortality were identified. Results Age at surgery was 35 ± 15 years, 53 % male, 52. 3 % were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, 37. 2 % in class II and 10. 4 % in class III/IV. Early mortality was 1. 77 % with independent predictors NYHA class ≥ III, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) < 15 [*]mm and female gender. Over a mean follow-up of 2. 8 ± 2. 6 years, 46 patients died. Baseline predictors of total mortality were NYHA class ≥ III, TAPSE < 15 [*]mm and non-elective surgery. The number of <b>sternotomies</b> was not independently associated with neither early nor total mortality. At 10 years, probability of survival was 94 %. NYHA class among survivors was significantly improved, compared with baseline.

40|$|Objective: Myocardial {{fibrosis}} {{has been}} associated with poorer outcomes in tetralogy of Fallot, however only a handful of studies have assessed its significance in the current era. Our aim was to quantify the amount of late gadolinium enhancement in both the LV and RV in a contemporary cohort of adults with surgically repaired tetralogy of Fallot, and assess the relationship with adverse clinical outcomes. Design: Single centre cohort study Setting: National tertiary referral center Patients: One hundred fourteen patients with surgically repaired tetralogy of Fallot with median age 29. 5 years (range 17. 5 - 64. 2). Prospective follow-up for mean 2. 4 years (SD 1. 29). Interventions: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance was performed, and late gadolinium enhancement mass was estimated for the LV using the 5 -SD remote myocardium method, and for the RV using a segmental scoring system. Cohort characterization was determined {{through the use of a}} computerized database. Outcome measures: Survival analysis from time of scan to first adverse event, defined as an episode of atrial arrhythmia, sustained ventricular arrhythmia, hospitalization with heart failure, or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator insertion. Results: Eleven patients experienced an adverse outcome in the follow-up period, although there were no deaths. LV late gadolinium enhancement was associated with adverse outcomes in a univariate model (P[*]=[*]. 027). However, when adjusted for age at scan the significant variables included NYHA class (P[*]=[*]. 006), peak oxygen uptake (P[*]=[*]. 028), number of prior <b>sternotomies</b> (P[*]=[*]. 044), and higher indexed RV and LV end diastolic volumes (P[*]=[*]. 002 and P[*]<[*]. 001), but not RV or LV late gadolinium enhancement.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Patients with tetralogy of Fallot/pulmonary atresia {{often have}} {{bilateral}} pulmonary artery lesions, including diminutive central and peripheral vessels, major aortopulmonary collaterals, and distortion from previous operations. Staged procedures through lateral thoracotomies and median <b>sternotomies</b> {{have traditionally been}} used for repair. Methods: Between October 1993 and December 1995, 10 patients 3 months to 15 years old with complex tetralogy of Fallot/pulmonary atresia underwent repair via a clamshell approach. Nine had undergone a mean of 2. 8 ± 0. 8 previous operations (range 1 to 4). Indications for operation were repair of pulmonary artery arborization anomalies in 10 (4 unilateral, 6 bilateral), with unifocalization in 6 (2 unilateral, 4 bilateral). Results: Eight of 10 patients had concomitant complete repair. There were no deaths at a mean follow-up of 17. 1 ± 4. 0 months (range 12 to 26). Mean ventilation time was 3. 7 ± 2. 1 days (range 1 to 14) and hospital stay 8. 7 ± 4. 6 days (range 4 to 19). At follow-up, the peak right ventricular/left ventricular pressure ratio in patients who received complete repair was 0. 44 ± 0. 13 (0. 30 to 0. 67). One patient (10 %) required reoperation because of pseudoaneurysm of the main pulmonary artery 14 months after repair, and one had successful stent placement because of recurrent left and right pulmonary artery stenosis 8 months after repair. Two infants who underwent complete unifocalization and central pulmonary artery reconstruction are awaiting completion of repair. Conclusions: The clamshell approach to complex tetralogy of Fallot/pulmonary atresia provides simultaneous exposure of bilateral central and peripheral pulmonary artery lesions and intracardiac pathologic conditions. This procedure appears safe and may decrease the number of operations required to complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot/pulmonary atresia in selected patients.
