Twelve male students {{participated in the study}} (mean ± s: age 12. 7 ± 0. 4 years, mass 40. 7 ± 0; 5. 9 kg, height 1. 50 ± 0. 04 m). Cloth <b>sport</b> <b>shoes,</b> running shoes, basketball shoes, cross-training shoes, and barefoot conditions were investigated in random sequence. Human pendulum and cutting movement tests were used to assess cushioning performance and lateral stability, respectively. For cushioning, the running shoes (2. 06 body weight, BW) performed the best, while the cross-training shoes (2. 30 BW) and the basketball shoes (2. 37 BW) both performed better than the cloth <b>sport</b> <b>shoes</b> (2. 55 BW) and going barefoot (2. 63 BW). For the lateral stability test, range of inversion-eversion was found to be from 3. 6 to 4. 9 °, which was far less than that for adult participants (40 ms) and was unlikely to evoke intrinsic stability failure. In conclusion, the cloth <b>sport</b> <b>shoe</b> showed inferior cushioning capability but the same lateral stability as the other <b>sports</b> <b>shoes</b> for children...|$|R

50|$|To take {{advantage}} of the first, aggressive advertising of factual information must be conducted and 'on sale' type deals must be offered. This is because someone who receives a message centrally listens to reason, knows a lot about the industry or does not know why he needs the product or service yet. If the best deal is offered, we can expect that the customers will take part in the service. Businesses who sell a product that is not a necessity should use this strategy. Conglomerates within a highly competitive industry should use this theory as well. We'll use the <b>sports</b> <b>shoe</b> consumers as an example. This product is in the maturity stage of the product life cycle, as a result, there is a high level of competition. The consumer gains the advantage of choice and access to options and information.

Retailers should implement these two strategies in order to highlight reasons a customer should visit their store.|$|E
