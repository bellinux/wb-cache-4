40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} what were desirable and undesirable student nurse characteristics in the 1950 / 1960 s and relate them to those who had successfully completed the programme and gained State Registration and those who had not. A further aim was to undertake comparisons with modern day values of what are viewed as desirable traits in nurses. Background: In the 1950 / 1960 s student nurses were hospital employees. Nurse training was based in hospital training schools and coordinated by <b>sister</b> <b>tutors.</b> Learning about nursing largely took place in clinical settings where there was limited supervision of student nurses by qualified nurses. Design: Content analysis approaches were used whereby positive and negative comments related to successful and unsuccessful completers were identified. Methods: Data were extracted from individual training records relating to 641 student nurses. The records dated from 1955 to 1968. Clinical and training school reports were summarized by senior hospital figures such as the hospital matron. These reports were the focus of the analysis. Findings: Desirable student nurse traits identified in the analysis were being a ‘nice person’, who is kind, compassionate and attentive to patients, conscientious, bright and intelligent. Other values such as being hard-working, reliable and punctual reflect that the students studied were primarily employees. Amenable to discipline and unquestioningly obeying a doctor's order also were part of the conventions of the time. Most negative comments related to the unsuccessful completers. Conclusions: New insights into what was viewed as desirable and undesirable nursing characteristics in the 1950 / 1960 s are identified. These insights have national and international relevance. ...|$|R

50|$|Muhammad Yusuf Hashmi {{was born}} into an old Muslim noble Syed family (Hashmi-Qureshi) at a village in Sialkot District, {{which at the time}} was part of British India.

40|$|Navigating {{the public}} school system can be {{detrimental}} to the mental health of a student with Asperger’s syndrome (AS). Support from other students, teachers, and administrators is limited for these students with AS, which escalates the AS student’s stress and behaviors, creating a huge need for the use of coping skills and learning strategies. The end result is the student with AS feeling a need to continuously switch schools or even give up and withdraw. Parents tend to blame the school in general, and hope that a new school will have the empathy and understanding the student with AS needs. The researchers will demonstrate how the family chose to change from a traditional academic high school in exchange for a non-traditional online high school, and how they further implemented learning strategies based on current research methodology and external support systems to positively affect the student’s academic growth and development. The learning strategies that the family applied will be illustrated {{from the point of view}} of the high school student with AS, his <b>sister,</b> who <b>tutors</b> and supports him, and also from his mom, who is his main support system and high school learning coach.

5000|$|By 1689, {{power was}} {{slipping}} from Sophia's hands; Peter (aged 17) was intent upon declaring his majority and demanding power. To pre-empt this, Sophia attempted {{to raise a}} riot in the city, spreading the rumour that the Naryshkins had destroyed Ivan's crown and were poised to set his room on fire. This was untrue, and Ivan {{may not have been}} taken into confidence by his <b>sister</b> and <b>tutored</b> about what he should say or do. A simpleton, he may not have understood the implications of not supporting her. When the riots began, Ivan's tutor, Prince Prozorovsky, persuaded him to publicly declare his faith in his brother Peter and make it known that he was unharmed and in no danger for life or liberty. Ivan did this, and also supported Peter's contention that the time had come for terminating the regency. Peter was declared to be of age and Sophia's regency was terminated. Ivan being both incapable and disinterested, Peter came into his own and functioned as though he were the sole Tsar. The eventual result was that over time, the various outward signs of deference and power which Ivan had enjoyed during the regency slowly withered away, and he became a non-entity in the Russian court. For the last decade of his life, Ivan was completely overshadowed by the more energetic Peter I. He spent his days with his wife, Praskovia Saltykova, caring about little but [...] "fasting and praying day and night".|$|R

40|$|M. Cur. The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} study was to describe guidelines to improve the community health clinics as a learning context conducive to learning. The objectives of the study commenced by getting the perception of student nurses, community <b>sisters</b> and college <b>tutors,</b> to explore and describe the problems experienced in relation to community health clinics as a learning context for student nurses, especially when they are allocated for their clinical practicals to prepare them to become competent. The research design and method used, consisted of a qualitative approach to achieve the intended goal of the research study. The design was divided into two phases: Phase one consisted of a field/empirical study and phase two consisted of conceptualization. Phase one has three steps where each step indicates the research method, population and sampling, data collection and data analysis. Population and sampling for step I included all the fourth year students from a nursing college in Gauteng, who are in an educational programme leading to registration as a nurse (general, psychiatric and community) and midwife. Population and sampling for step II consisted of community sisters from ten community health clinics in the Southern Metropolitan Local Council. Population and sampling for step III consisted of community college tutors from a college in Gauteng; the sample size consisted of the whole population. In all the steps follow-up interviews were conducted to confirm the findings. To ensure trustworthiness Lincoln and Guba's (1985) model was implemented, and data analysis were according to Tesch's (1990 in Creswell, 1994 : 155) method, based on a qualitative approach. The major problems reflected in the research findings based on Step I, II, II indicate similarities and Step III only indicates some uniqueness. The conceptual framework was discussed, indicating a body of knowledge, based on the study and empirical findings from phase I, to give clear meaning and understanding regarding the research study. Problems from all the steps were used in an integrated manner as research findings and were compared with existing literature within the framework, to determine similarities and differences as literature control method. Guidelines were then formulated from phases I and II, to solve the indicated problems, based on the three different sample groups. Guidelines were supported by the conclusion statement from chapter four and the problem statement from chapter three. Essential actions were indicated for operationalisation. Ethical consideration was maintained throughout the research study. The study has been evaluated by means {{of positive and negative}} issues related to the actual research process. Recommendations related to nursing education, nursing practice and nursing research were indicated accordingly...|$|R
