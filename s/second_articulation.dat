An example of a doubly articulated consonant is the voiceless labial-velar plosive , which is a [...] and a [...] pronounced simultaneously.

50|$|R. Isaac Luria, the Ari, recast Kabbalah {{into its}} <b>second</b> <b>articulation,</b> after R. Moshe Cordovero, the Ramak, had systemised differing Medieval {{interpretations of the}} Zohar. Philosophically {{influenced}} Medieval Kabbalah had described the 10 sefirot as Divine channels in a linear, emanated descending Creation. Lurianic Partzufim, instead, described dynamic interactions in Divine influence, where each Persona interacts and enclothes itself independently within the others, turning the unfolding of Creation into a dynamic scheme of spiritual enclothement, like a soul becoming enclothed in a body. In Lurianism, the original independent scheme of sefirot, described by Cordovero, precipitates the collapse of Tohu-"Chaos". Their reformation as Partzufim in the stable World of Atzilut begins cosmic repair. Man, whose soul embodies the harmonised order of Partzufim, achieves rectification of the three lower Worlds by redeeming the exiled Sparks of Holiness through Torah study and performance of mitzvot. The anthropomorphic metaphor of the Partzufim stressed the need by Kabbalists to divest the Lurianic concepts from false corporeal, materialistic analogy.|$|E
50|$|The neck of Leonorasaurus {{is known}} almost completely, only the atlas is lost. The nine {{remaining}} cervicals were found articulated {{with the first}} five complete dorsal (trunk) vertebrae. Additionally, a probable sixth dorsal and an articulated group of three mid-dorsals were found. Fragments of more posterior dorsals and of ribs were also recovered. The sacrum (fused vertebrae that form {{the core of the}} hip), consisting of four vertebrae, is nearly complete, but no bones of the tail was recovered.The overall shape of the neck vertebrae is typical for basal sauropodomorphs, but Pol et al. interpret the remains of the neural arches to indicate a more sauropod-like shape. Some characters, however, show an intermediate development. In the trunk, the vertebrae show typical non-sauropod characters, such as relatively long and low neural arches with a narrow anterior ridge (the anteriormost dorsal vertebrae have slightly high neural arches), an anteriorly placed parapophysis (one of the articulation points for the ribs), and lack of or less strong development of certain laminae (thin ridges). The diapophysis (the <b>second</b> <b>articulation</b> for the rib) is also in the same position as in basal sauropodomorphs. A lamina connecting the diapophysis to the prezygapophysis on all dorsals, but not in no-sauropod sauropodomorphs, is present in the posterior dorsals.|$|E
40|$|This talk {{is devoted}} to a rather ‘conceptual ’ {{discussion}} of some notions that bear directly {{on the relationship between}} phonology and morphosyntax. First I will discuss some of the original formulations of the principle of Dual Articulation (Dual Patterning) as found in the work of Martinet, Meillet and Hockett, and then we’ll see how dual articulation is now often understood. Initially, there existed a ‘sequential ’ understanding of this notion. In the first articulation, words (or morphemes) consist of (meaningless) segments, while in the <b>second</b> <b>articulation,</b> words/morphemes are grouped into larger meaningful constructions. Thus morpho-syntactic structure is built on top of (word) phonological structure. In the first articulation constructions of meaningless units (phonological forms) are (largely arbitrarily) linked to meanings, while in the <b>second</b> <b>articulation</b> meaning is linked to specific (hierarchical) structures, the morphosyntactic form. Thus, phonology and morpho-syntax together constitute the form of language and ‘grammar ’ is the system of basic units and combination rules that we use to describe that form. At the level of phonology, the basic units are ‘features’, while the morpho-syntactic basic units are the category labels Noun, Verb, etc. The kinds of combination rules in both domains are largely the same which brings me to th...|$|E
5000|$|Clicks are doubly {{articulated}} by definition: they involve a coronal (more rarely labial) forward articulation, which defines the various 'types' of clicks and the IPA letter assigned, plus a dorsal closure that pulls double duty, both as the <b>second</b> place of <b>articulation,</b> {{and as the}} controlling mechanism of the lingual ingressive airstream. (Since clicks are uvular rather than velar, the term [...] "lingual" [...] is often used instead of the old [...] "velaric".) The release of the dorsal closure can be delayed, producing a second burst with a pulmonic (linguo-pulmonic) or ejective (linguo-glottalic) airstream.|$|R

40|$|Time-based {{theories}} expect memory {{performance to}} decline as the delay between study and recall of an item increases. The assumption of time-based forgetting, central to many models of serial recall, underpins their key behaviors. Here we compare {{the predictions of}} time-based and event-based models by simulation and test them in two experiments using a novel manipulation of the delay between study and retrieval. Participants were trained, via corrective feedback, to recall at different speeds, thus varying total recall time from 6 to 10 see. In the first experiment, participants used the keyboard to enter their responses but had to repeat a word (called the suppressor) aloud during recall to prevent rehearsal. In the <b>second</b> experiment, <b>articulation</b> was again required, but recall was verbal and was paced {{by the number of}} repetitions of the suppressor in between retrieval of items. In both experiments, serial position curves for all retrieval speeds overlapped, and output time had little or no effect. Comparative evaluation of a time-based and an event-based model confirmed that these results present a particular challenge to time-based approaches. We conclude that output interference, rather than output time, is critical in serial recall. ...|$|R

Moreover, Guido asserts significantly that the greatest and most numerous units are constituted by very small and few units.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the application of}} the mutual manipulability criterion as a way to demarcate constituents of cognitive systems from resources having a mere causal influence on cognitive systems. In particular, it is argued that on at least one interpretation of the mutual manipulability criterion, the criterion is inadequate because the criterion is conceptualized as identifying synchronic dependence between higher and lower 2 ̆ 7 levels 2 ̆ 7 in mechanisms. It is argued that there is a <b>second</b> <b>articulation</b> of the mutual manipulability criterion available, and that it should be preferred for at least two reasons. The first is that the criterion of mutual manipulability is an instance of continuous reciprocal causation. The second is that it has implications for how to understand this distinction between causation and constitution. It is shown that when considering dynamic systems, continuous reciprocal causation - ubiquitous in dynamical systems - is a form of constitutive causality, which entails that causal factors may, in the right circumstances, by genuine constitutive factors of cognition. This notion of constitutive causality lends support to conceiving of the mutual manipulability criterion as a genuine demarcation principle in the debate over the boundaries of mind...|$|E
40|$|An {{acoustic}} {{study is}} carried out {{to see whether the}} phenomenon of pharyngalization and/or velarizsation is confined to the emphatic consonant and the adjacent vowels or it extends over the whole word in Arabic. Measurements in Hz of F 1 & F 2 of front unrounded vowels in monosyllabic, bisyllabic and trisyllabic words in ISA having emphatic vs. non-emphatic consonants were made. They showed significant narrowing between F 1 & F 2 for vowels in the vicinity of emphatic consonants than those in the vicinity of non-emphatic consonants. This is attributed to the secondary coarticulatory configuration formed in the pharyngeal region by the projection of the root of the tongue toward the back wall of the pharynx and possible lowering of the velum toward rising tongue dorsum which prevails, though in different levels of significance, over the other syllables of the word. Phonetic and phonological background. Arabic emphatic consonants are characterized by two types of articulations. Abercrombie (1967) calls them primary and secondary articulations. He describes the secondary articulation as a stricture that involves less constriction of the vocal tract than the primary stricture. The most evident feature characterizing this secondary articulation, as agreed by many phoneticians, is the constriction of the pharynx and whence the term pharyngalization. In their cinefluorographic study, Ali and Danilof (1972) found out that during the articulation of emphatic consonants the tongue exhibits a simultaneous slight depression of the palatine dorsum and a rearward movement of the pharyngeal dorsum toward the posterior pharyngeal wall. They also observed a lowering velum toward rising tongue dorsum. What is more interesting in Arabic phonology is that this <b>second</b> <b>articulation</b> determines phonemic distinction between sounds having the same primary articulation e. g / seef / “sword...|$|E

This network called “Organized Community” began a process of self-organization with the purpose of developing basic urban infrastructure in five neighborhoods. There are three main hypotheses.

40|$|An {{outstanding}} {{characteristic of}} human “natural ” language is the linearity of its messages, which {{is nothing else}} {{but the fact that}} contrasts, i. e. relationships among elements found together within one message, are displayed along one dimension only. Even though such linearity is far from complete, it has impressed many students of language for centuries, cha-racterizing as it does both the first and <b>second</b> <b>articulation,</b> i. e. not only the relationship among meaningful elements but also that among non-meaningful but distinctive ones. The latter are the phonemes. For thousands of years students of language have been aware of the existence of phonemes, i. e. minimal segments within the spoken message whose presence is relevant for distinguishing one message from a different one with another meaning even though the phonemes themselves lack any meaning whatsoever. (An anticipation of a modern phonological treatment {{is to be found in}} the work of King Sejong of Korea (reigned 1418 - 50), the founder of the Korean featural script Han’gŭl; see Sampson, pp. 120 ff.) The main difficulty concerning the existence and nature of phonemes is that each of them underlies a great many different phonetic realizations. Such a phonetic variation depends on a number of factors. There are individual, free and contextually conditioned variations, whether accountable for in terms of phonetic influence of neighbouring sounds or not. Even though for thousands of years many people have known about the existence of phonemes in-spite of such variations, 19 th century linguists focused on the phonetic realizations themselves. The Russian linguist Jan Baudoin de Courtenay (1845 - 1925) was one of the first to anticipate the modern notion of phoneme, developed in the structuralist movement initiated in 1916 with the publication of the Cours de linguistique générale by Ferdinand de Saussure (1857 - 1913). That book does not, however, reach the stage of a clear acknowledgment of the phonemes. The main developments in the conception of the phonemes were attained i...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to focus on}} an often {{neglected}} aspect of Maupassant's short stories, namely {{the nature of the relationship}} they trigger between the author, the text, and the reader. After examining the reception of Maupassant's works from a historical viewpoint, I concentrate on their appareil démarcatif, or key-points in terms of structure. This leads me to consider the impact of the paratext (titles, subtitles, epigraphs, and dedications), framing devices - a pattern that recalls the oral tale from which the written short story is derived - and closure on Maupassant's wide range of readers. The analysis concentrates mainly on the Contes et Nouvelles because their brevity and their characteristics make them ideal for a detailed study of the appareil démarcatif which governs their structure. The <b>second</b> major <b>articulation</b> of my thesis is to focus on the recurring themes and characters used by the author to make his fictional writings plausible. Because Maupassant did not prove exceptionally original in his use of these thematic devices, this leads me to explore the conventions that rule his fictional universe. Basing my approach on Jonathan Culler's Stucturalist Poetics, I undertake to demonstrate that the vraisemblance at stake in Maupassant's texts proceeds from four levels of conventions, each linked to a particular thematic object. While the notion of 'cultural vraisemblance' concerns characters, who remain highly stereotypical in both an attempt to familiarise the reader with the contextual content and a conscious wish to maintain the concision of the story, that of the 'conventionally natural' depends heavily on metalanguage; the plot and themes are in turn affected by the genericity of the text. The fourth level, constituted by the ironic content, is set apart as a level which contaminates the other three...|$|R
50|$|Laid {{out as an}} {{architectural}} counterpart of the Old Palace, the new royal residence historically supported the earlier concept of a palace complex, highlighting the need for rounding off spatially and symbolically a whole that connoted {{the very idea of}} the state. The three store building was designed in the style of academism with elements borrowed mostly from Renaissance and Baroque architecture. The most imposing facade faced the garden, and the corner took the form of a domed tower similar to the solution used for the Old Palace. The horizontal facade division showed a rusticated semi-basement, the ground floor and the first floor integrated into one central composition, and an independently and more unassumingly treated <b>second</b> floor.The <b>articulation</b> of the main facade was achieved by a central and two end projections, and a curved, centrally positioned entrance porch. In accordance with the purpose of the building, special attention in ornamenting the façades was paid to heraldic symbols. The semicircular pediment above the cornice of the central projecting bay contained the full armorial achievement of the royal house of Karadjordjević. The tallest and, consequently, dominant element of the New Palace - the tower capped with a dome tapering into a spire topped by a bronze eagle rising - provided the architectural link between the facades facing Kralja Milana and Andrićev venac streets. Another important heraldic composition was placed just beneath the dome of the corner tower: two identical, symmetrically placed shields with a cross between four fire-steels, i.e. an element of the coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Serbia, which subsequently was incorporated into the coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The central motif of the façade facing Andrićev venac was the curved projecting bay whose attic was surmounted by a monumental ornamental composition featuring the coat-of-arms in the centre.|$|R

The seminal novel that has propagated the Bildungsroman genre is Goethe’s Wilhelm Meister’s Apprenticeship (1795). Bildungsroman, commonly {{understood as a}} narrative of self-formation, was conceived in Germany {{in the late eighteenth}} century in the age of humanism and emphasizes the harmonious integration of the individual with society. This social mission also carries over to aesthetic idealism’s notion of form, which is modeled on the organic unity of parts and the whole. Comparing Gombrowicz’s Ferydurke with Goethe’s Wilhelm Meister’s Apprenticeship, the article contends that Ferdydurke displaces Bildungroman’s notion of “beautiful totality” by a grotesque aesthetics of parts that alludes to the collapse of harmonious social relations in the aftermath of the First World War, and on the threshold of the <b>Second.</b> Gombrowicz’s unique <b>articulation</b> of Form as the sedimentation of interpersonal antagonism is embodied in Ferdydurke, which, much like its protagonist, sabotages its own formal maturation through manifestoes, theoretical reflections, narrative digressions, and prefaces to the digressions thrown between the chapters.

Namely, the failure to situate the event, write or define it, in context of grand narratives. I show anxieties about objects, identities, and religion can be read from two corresponding directions.

The iconological prospect, according to the School of Warburg, which identifies in the Góngora poem a vision development postulated by the "scopic drive" and together with the layers of memory, culture and the arts - it is very complex, so as to make use of appropriate methodologies borrowed from mathematics of complexity: the Mandelbrot’s "theory of fractals", the Thom’s "catastrophe theory", etc [...] . The analysis therefore raises in relief a poetic structure that can account for the extraordinary modernity of an author who has made the link between the great age of the Baroque and the present, is not by chance defined as "neo-baroque. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis sets {{to sketch}} Chinese intellectuals’ {{sustained}} efforts {{to search for}} an alternative modernity to the Western model throughout the twentieth century, and uncover the interaction between intellectual politics and Chinese modernity discourse by historicizing and contextualizing Chinese modernity discourse. This study starts with delineating the consistence and the inconsistence of Chinese modernity discourses by juxtaposing different historical conditions and examining reappeared trends of thoughts. Three intellectual currents, i. e., cultural conservatism, humanism, and professionalism, which emerged in the May Fourth period and remerged in the post-socialist condition, are examined to mirror the spiral dynamics and the locus of Chinese modernity. Their respective roles in reconstructing Chinese cultural, ethical and academic orders in response to Western model of modernity are highlighted in the research. Cultural conservatism attempts to legitimize the Chinese culture {{in the framework of}} global modernity by resetting or reinterpreting the dialectical relation between the whole and part, universalism, and essentialism. Humanism emphasizes the standard, the guidance of authority, and the self-perfection to resist the ethical disorder caused by the so-called “modern spirit”, which is embodied by individualism, romanticism, and the immoderate expansion of desire. Professionalism influences the pattern of producing and reproducing knowledge about modernity by re-standardizing the academic and the discursive fields and by remolding the identity of the agents. After exposing how the “alternative modernity” in China, as a discursive-political device, has been produced and repackaged with various contents and meanings, this thesis proceeds to explore the intellectual pedestal of Chinese modernity discourses from two aspects. First, how do the intellectual strategies of self-positioning and position-taking influence knowledge production and reproduction of the Chinese modernity discourse; <b>second,</b> how <b>articulation</b> and re-articulation of modernity discourse reflect the self-adjustments of intellectual politics as well as identity shifts. Through the comparative and diachronic examinations, it poses that, as Chinese modernity discourse is increasingly served as a symbolic capital or a strategy of intellectual politics, it gradually loses its authenticity or even becomes a signifier without signified. Meanwhile, the state-led modernization practice is reversely becoming homogenous, stable, and less diverse, although the dominant ideology, namely, socialism with Chinese characteristics, is, in itself, hybrid, paradoxical, and strategically manufactured. published_or_final_versionComparative LiteratureDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} capabilities of documentary cinema to innovatively articulate traumatic history and memory and compel the viewer {{in the construction of}} meaningful remembrance. Since the mid- 1980 s, an increasingly prominent sub-genre of historical documentary films has emerged in which survivors of the Holocaust or their descendants travel to regions of Eastern Europe to uncover and make sense of their family’s traumatic past. These types of films are what Annette Insdorf has identified as “documentaries of return. ” They actively engage with three major questions: first, the evolving discourses of memory and their effect on the visual interpretation of traumatic history; <b>second,</b> the documentary <b>articulation</b> of embodied and spatial memory; and third, the conceptualization of the historical image that seeks more than authentic reflexivity. 	The challenge, then, is to investigate how documentaries of return, in the context of personal memory quests, enhance the mediation of traumatic history beyond the question of mimetic transparency. Five notable films explore this: Dark Lullabies (Irene Angelico, 1985), A Journey Back (Brian Mckenna, 1987), Birthplace (Pawel Lozinski, 1992), Shtetl (Marian Marzynski, 1996), and Hiding and Seeking: Faith and Tolerance after the Holocaust (Menachem Daum & Oren Rudavsky, 2004). Through their experiential exploration of memorial affect and memorial space, and through their formulation of the image beyond mere historical representation, these films further our understanding of the complexities and nuances of traumatic memory and history amidst the growing abundance of representations of trauma in contemporary media. ...|$|R
40|$|A foreign {{language}} (L 2) learned after childhood {{results in an}} accent. This functional neuroimaging study investigated speech in L 2 as a sensory-motor skill. The hypothesis was {{that there would be}} an altered response in auditory and somatosensory association cortex, specifically the planum temporale and parietal operculum, respectively, when speaking in L 2 relative to L 1, independent of rate of speaking. These regions were selected for three reasons. First, an influential computational model proposes that these cortices integrate predictive feedforward and postarticulatory sensory feedback signals during <b>articulation.</b> <b>Second,</b> these adjacent regions (known as Spt) have been identified as a “sensory-motor interface” for speech production. Third, probabilistic anatomical atlases exist for these regions, to ensure the analyses are confined to sensory-motor differences between L 2 and L 1. The study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and participants produced connected overt speech. The first hypothesis was that there would be greater activity in the planum temporale and the parietal operculum when subjects spoke in L 2 compared with L 1, one interpretation being that there is less efficient postarticulatory sensory monitoring when speaking in the less familiar L 2. The second hypothesis was that this effect would be observed in both cerebral hemispheres. Although Spt is considered to be left-lateralized, this is based on studies of covert speech, whereas overt speech is accompanied by sensory feedback to bilateral auditory and somatosensory cortices. Both hypotheses were confirmed by the results. These findings provide the basis for future investigations of sensory-motor aspects of language learning using serial fMRI studies...|$|R
40|$|My thesis, "Love and Violence in Transracial/national Adoption," {{examines}} a New York Times special transracial adoption blog series, "Relative Choices," to critically interrogate how {{love and}} violence operate in adoption discourse. In doing so, it explores two main questions: How have transracial/national adoptions been posited {{in the past}} and how does that inform current <b>articulations?</b> <b>Second,</b> how would a global/historical framework help rethink transracial/national adoptions beyond one based on the local/present? Specifically, I am interested in how a global/historical framework, on a larger level, disrupts our understandings of narratives of love, inclusion and progress and, on an individual family or particular level, how does such a framework challenge the strict constructions of the family, and then lastly, on both levels how does it reveal the productive violence at play? I argue that the normative narrative of adoption discourse has shifted from assimilation overdrive to the embracement of colorblindness and liberal multiculturalism through claims of inclusion, progression, and revolution. The condition of possibility for these assertions is mobilized by the ability of many adoptive supporters, parents and even adoptees to strategically place adoption in a local/ present framework. This positioning individualizes, depoliticizes, ahistoricizes transracial/national adoption, and it enables love to operate as the encompassing and guiding principle for adoption. While the concept and role of love is no doubt integral to the act (commitment) and process of adoption, its presence and hypervisibility obscures how the global and historical play important roles in shaping adoption. Specifically, the local/present framework erases and obfuscates the productive and political symbolic violence of transracial/national adoption...|$|R
