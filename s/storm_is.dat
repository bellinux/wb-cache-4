A {{repeat of the}} 1939 tropical storm would cause around 200million dollars in damage. The most serious damage would be due to rains rather than winds or storm surge, although distant hurricanes may still create heavy surf, possibly injuring or killing people. Nora caused millions in damage and skirted extreme southeastern California.|$|E
5|$|An Atlantic {{hurricane}} or tropical <b>storm</b> <b>is</b> {{a tropical}} cyclone that {{forms in the}} Atlantic Ocean, usually in the summer or fall. A hurricane differs from a cyclone or typhoon only {{on the basis of}} location. A hurricane is a storm that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, and a cyclone occurs in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean.|$|E
40|$|We {{find that}} during the dusty season on Mars (southern spring and summer) of years without a global dust <b>storm</b> there <b>are</b> three large regional-scale dust <b>storms.</b> The <b>storms</b> <b>are</b> labeled A, B, and C in {{seasonal}} order. This classification is based on examining the zonal mean 50 Pa (approximately 25 km) daytime temperature retrievals from TES/MGS and MCS/MRO over 6 Mars Years. Regional-scale <b>storms</b> <b>are</b> defined as events where the temperature exceeds 200 K. Examining the MCS dust field at 50 Pa indicates that warming in the Southern Hemisphere is dominated by direct heating, while northern high latitude warming is a dynamical response. A <b>storms</b> <b>are</b> springtime planet encircling Southern Hemisphere events. B <b>storms</b> <b>are</b> southern polar events that begin near perihelion and last through the solstice. C <b>storms</b> <b>are</b> southern summertime events starting well {{after the end of}} the B storm. C storms show the most interannual variability...|$|R

5|$|According to modern-day analysis, a {{tropical}} depression {{developed in the}} Pacific Ocean, south of El Salvador, early on September 27. It drifted northward across Central America and eastern Mexico before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico near Ciudad del Carmen on September 30. Weather reports had indicated low air pressures over the area for several days. It is relatively rare for {{a tropical}} cyclone to cross from the Pacific into the Atlantic, or vice versa, and this <b>storm</b> <b>is</b> among less than a dozen known to have officially done so. Only three other tropical cyclones have crossed from the eastern Pacific into the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|As the Racer {{endured the}} gale, another vessel to her north, HMSRingdove, felt the storm {{around the same}} time. Both ships {{recorded}} easterly winds for several days as they traversed the Yucatán Channel, indicating that the storm center remained to their south. The hurricane crossed the northern Yucatán Peninsula and moved west-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico, nearing {{the mouth of the}} Rio Grande by early on October3. The <b>storm</b> <b>is</b> estimated to have peaked as the equivalence of a Category4 or stronger on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson scale. As the hurricane approached a strong high pressure area to the north, it slowed drastically and recurved sharply to the northeast while its center was just off southern Texas.|$|E

5|$|August 7–9, 1993 - Tropical Storm Bret {{moves across}} {{northern}} Venezuela and Colombia. In Venezuela, the storm drops at least 13.35inches (339mm) in Guanare. The rainfall causes mudslides, particularly {{near the city}} of Caracas, that cover many low-income housing units. Of the 173 deaths caused by Bret in Venezuela, most occur in the low-income areas near Caracas. Lack of preparation, including weather forecasters prematurely stating the worst of the <b>storm</b> <b>is</b> over, is part of the problem. In all, 10,000 are left homeless, and damaged totals $25million (1993USD, $37million 2008USD). In Colombia, Bret causes one death and one injury.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Alberto {{completed}} the largest loop ever observed over the Atlantic Ocean, spanning approximately 5degrees latitude by 8degrees longitude. The <b>storm</b> <b>is</b> currently the ninth longest-lived storm in the Atlantic Ocean (lasting 19.75days), {{and is also}} the second longest-lived Atlantic storm during August (the longest lived is the 1899 Hurricane San Ciriaco). Also, Alberto is the third farthest-travelling in the Atlantic (travelling 6,500miles), only behind Hurricane Faith and Hurricane Carrie, being able to retain tropical characteristics at an unusually high latitude, up to 53˚N. The last storm to do so was Hurricane Frances in 1980.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to local}} {{officials}} the <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> an extreme nor'wester commonly formed over the Bay of Bengal during the hot {{months of the}} year. Meteorologist S.I. Laskar said the <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> due to an unstable atmosphere caused by excessive heat and humidity. [...] "It is quite normal in the pre-monsoon season," [...] he added. The severity of the <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> likely due to wind pulling the moisture from the Bay of Bengal northward to north Bihar, where it converged with another cloud formation to form a 20km tall cloud mass. The cool air in the clouds was met by hot air rising from the ground, which caused the storm to start rotating. Although thunderstorms had been predicted, {{the severity of the}} <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> unexpected.|$|R
