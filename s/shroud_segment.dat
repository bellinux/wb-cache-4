40|$|A {{clearance}} {{control apparatus}} has a positioning mechanism for controlling clearance between rotor blade tips and a <b>shroud</b> <b>segment</b> {{of a gas}} turbine engine casing. The positioning mechanism {{is supported by the}} casing, coupled to the <b>shroud</b> <b>segment,</b> and actuatable for moving the <b>shroud</b> <b>segment</b> toward and away from the rotor blade tips to reach a position at which a desired clearance is established. The mechanism includes a shaft and a bellcrank actuating assembly. The shaft is mounted through a passage defined by a mounting structure on the casing for radial movement along a longitudinal axis of the shaft toward and away from the rotor axis and is coupled at its inner end to the <b>shroud</b> <b>segment.</b> The bellcrank actuating assembly is coupled to an outer end of the shaft and mounted to the casing adjacent the shaft for pivotal movement about an axis spaced from and extending transverse to the longitudinal axis of the shaft. The pivotal movement of the bellcrank actuating assembly produces radial movement of the shaft and <b>shroud</b> <b>segment</b> therewith toward and away from the rotor blade tips...|$|E
40|$|Gas {{turbine engine}} design is a {{multidisciplinary}} and iterative process. Many design iterations {{are necessary to}} address the challenges among the disciplines. In {{the creation of a}} new engine architecture, the design time is crucial in capturing new business opportunities. At the detail design phase, it was proven very difficult to correct an unsatisfactory design. To overcome this difficulty, the concept of Multi-Disciplinary Optimization (MDO) at the preliminary design phase (Preliminary MDO or PMDO) is used allowing more freedom to perform changes in the design. PMDO also reduces the design time at the preliminary design phase. The concept of PMDO was used was used to create parametric models, and new corr√©lations for high pressure gas turbine housing and shroud segments towards a new design process. First, dedicated parametric models were created because of their reusability and versatility. Their ease of use compared to non-parameterized models allows more design iterations thus reduces set up and design time. Second, geometry correlations were created to minimize the number of parameters used in turbine housing and <b>shroud</b> <b>segment</b> design. Since the turbine housing and the <b>shroud</b> <b>segment</b> geometries are required in tip clearance analyses, care was taken as to not oversimplify the parametric formulation. In addition, a user interface was developed to interact with the parametric models and improve the design time. Third, the cooling flow predictions require many engine parameters (i. e. geometric and performance parameters and air properties) and a reference shroud segments. A second correlation study was conducted to minimize the number of engine parameters required in the cooling flow predictions and to facilitate the selection of a reference <b>shroud</b> <b>segment.</b> Finally, the parametric models, the geometry correlations, and the user interface resulted in a time saving of 50 % and an increase in accuracy of 56 % in the new design system compared to the existing design system. Also, regarding the cooling flow correlations, the number of engine parameters was reduced by a factor of 6 to create a simplified prediction model and hence a faster <b>shroud</b> <b>segment</b> selection process...|$|E
40|$|Two {{nondestructive}} {{techniques were}} used to evaluate diffusion bond quality between a metal fail honeycomb and porous wireform substrate. The two techniques, cryographics and acousto-ultrasonics, are complementary in revealing variations of bond integrity and quality in <b>shroud</b> <b>segments</b> from an experimental aircraft turbine engine. Previously announced in STAR as N 82 - 1861...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} load factor and rotor {{eccentricity}} were determined on flow conditions in test series for two stages. The {{results indicate that}} swirl-type entry flow follows the rules of potential swirl. Within the labyrinth cavities two spatial separated flow areas are considered. A dominating flow in periphera direction nearly fills {{the space between the}} sealing strips and the ceiling of the cavity. Below this flow, an area of axial mass transport is situated, with a slight peripheral component, limited on the nearest surroundings of the seals gap and the rotor surface. Between both flows, an exchange of energy takes place. Within the gaps, flow direction depends on axial velocity and therefore on variable flow contraction. A balance of energy within the seal and the cavities interprets the results of lateral force measurements as an influence of friction at the sealing strips surface and the rotating shaft surface. Stages with their blades put together in buckets by means of <b>shrouding</b> <b>segments</b> are particularly influenced by the rotating speed of the shrouding...|$|R
40|$|A {{new high}} {{pressure}} turbine shroud material {{has been developed}} from the consolidation of prealloyed powders of Ni, Cr, Al and Y. The new material, a filler for cast turbine <b>shroud</b> body <b>segments,</b> is called Genaseal. The development followed the identification of oxidation resistance as {{the primary cause of}} prior shroud deterioration, since conversion to oxides reduces erosion resistance and increases spalling under thermal cycled engine conditions. The NICrAlY composition was selected in preference to NIAL and FeCRALY alloys, and was formulated to a prescribed density range that offers suitable erosion resistance, thermal conductivity and elastic modulus for improved behavior as a shroud...|$|R
40|$|Initial {{focusing}} segmented mirrors {{that must}} be deployed in space, such as the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST), provide challenges not faced before {{in the area of}} adaptive optics. The devices used to focus the mirror must minimize the power used and unnecessary mechanical movement. The device described in this report requires no movable parts except for the essential actuators required to move the mirror segments. Detail description of the components can be found in Coker, 1996. The primary mirror of the NGST will consist of 9 segments, a central annular segment, surrounded by 8 segments. The entire mirror assembly will be an 8 meter nearly filled circle (with the corners of the segments clipped to allow for storage in an Atlas IIe <b>shroud).</b> As the <b>segments</b> of the primary mirror are deployed to their operational positions, they must be positioned to within small fractions of a wavelength of near infrared light. When focused, the NGST will put most of its collected li-ht into the small region near the center of its focal plane. The ratio of the total light in the diffraction limited spot about the center of the focal plane to the total light in the focal plane. The purpose of this research effort is to design and build a device that will measure Strehl ratio and to use demonstrate that the Strehl ratio can be used to focus a segmented mirror...|$|R
40|$|Reducing {{blade tip}} {{clearances}} through active {{tip clearance control}} in the high pressure turbine can lead to significant reductions in emissions and specific fuel consumption as well as dramatic improvements in operating efficiency and increased service life. Current engines employ scheduled cooling of the outer case flanges to reduce high pressure turbine tip clearances during cruise conditions. These systems have relatively slow response and do not use clearance measurement, thereby forcing cold build clearances to set the minimum clearances at extreme operating conditions (e. g., takeoff, reburst) and not allowing cruise clearances to be minimized due {{to the possibility of}} throttle transients (e. g., step change in altitude). In an effort to improve upon current thermal methods, a first generation mechanically-actuated active clearance control (ACC) system has been designed and fabricated. The system utilizes independent actuators, a <b>segmented</b> <b>shroud</b> structure, and clearance measurement feedback to provide fast and precise active clearance control throughout engine operation. Ambient temperature performance tests of this first generation ACC system assessed individual seal component leakage rates and both static and dynamic overall system leakage rates. The ability of the nine electric stepper motors to control the position of the seal carriers in both open- and closed-loop control modes for single and multiple cycles was investigated. The ability of the system to follow simulated engine clearance transients in closed-loop mode showed the system was able to track clearances to within a tight tolerance (0. 001 in. error) ...|$|R
