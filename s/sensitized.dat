5|$|Along {{with other}} members of the lipocalin protein family, major urinary {{proteins}} can be potent allergens to humans. The reason for this is not known, however molecular mimicry between Mups and structurally similar human lipocalins has been proposed as a possible explanation. The protein product of the mouse Mup17 gene, known as Musm1, Ag1 or MA1, accounts for much of the allergenic properties of mouse urine. The protein is extremely stable in the environment; studies have found 95% of inner city homes, and 82% of all types of homes in the United States have detectable levels in at least one room. Similarly, Ratn1 is a known human allergen. A US study found its presence in 33% of inner city homes, and 21% of occupants were <b>sensitized</b> to the allergen. Exposure and sensitization to rodent Mup proteins is considered a risk factor for childhood asthma, and is a leading cause of laboratory animal allergy (LAA)—an occupational disease of laboratory animal technicians and scientists. One study found that two-thirds of laboratory workers who had developed asthmatic reactions to animals had antibodies to Ratn1.|$|E

So in practice a trade-off is always needed. Explanation is presented theoretically. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved...|$|R

For example, cats have 3 known blood types, cattle have 11, dogs have 12, pigs 16 and horses have 34. However, in many species (especially horses and dogs), cross matching is not required before the first transfusion, as antibodies against non-self cell surface antigens are not expressed constitutively – i.e. the animal has to be <b>sensitized</b> before it will mount an immune response against the transfused blood.|$|E

25|$|The {{immune system}} must balance between being {{sensitive}} {{enough to protect}} against infection, and become <b>sensitized</b> to attack the body's own proteins (autoimmunity). During an immune reaction to a foreign stimulus, such as bacteria, virus, or allergen, immune cells that would normally be deactivated due to their affinity for self-tissues can be abnormally activated by signaling sequences of antigen-presenting cells. Thus triggers may include viruses, bacteria, allergens (IgE and other hypersensitivity), and can be aggravated by environmental stimulants such as ultraviolet light and certain drug reactions. These stimuli begin a reaction that leads to destruction of other cells {{in the body and}} exposure of their DNA, histones, and other proteins, particularly parts of the cell nucleus. The body's <b>sensitized</b> B-lymphocyte cells will now produce antibodies against these nuclear-related proteins. These antibodies clump into antibody-protein complexes which stick to surfaces and damage blood vessels in critical areas of the body, such as the glomeruli of the kidney; these antibody attacks are the cause of SLE. Researchers are now identifying the individual genes, the proteins they produce, and their role in the immune system. Each protein is a link on the autoimmune chain, and researchers are trying to find drugs to break each of those links.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of phantom pain in upper limb amputees is nearly 82%, and in lower limb amputees is 54%. One {{study found that}} eight days after amputation, 72% of patients had phantom limb pain, and six months later, 67% reported it. Some amputees experience continuous pain that varies in intensity or quality; others experience several bouts of pain per day, or it may reoccur less often. It {{is often described as}} shooting, crushing, burning or cramping. If the pain is continuous for a long period, parts of the intact body may become <b>sensitized,</b> so that touching them evokes pain in the phantom limb. Phantom limb pain may accompany urination or defecation.|$|E
25|$|Although the dye {{is highly}} {{efficient}} at converting absorbed photons into free electrons in the TiO2, only photons {{absorbed by the}} dye ultimately produce current. The rate of photon absorption depends upon the absorption spectrum of the <b>sensitized</b> TiO2 layer and upon the solar flux spectrum. The overlap between these two spectra determines the maximum possible photocurrent. Typically used dye molecules generally have poorer absorption in the red part of the spectrum compared to silicon, which means that fewer of the photons in sunlight are usable for current generation. These factors limit the current generated by a DSSC, for comparison, a traditional silicon-based solar cell offers about 35 mA/cm2, whereas current DSSCs offer about 20 mA/cm2.|$|E

When the negative is removed, the unexposed mixture on the screen can be washed off with warm water, leaving the hardened mixture intact, acting as a precise mask of the desired pattern, which can then be printed with the usual screen-printing process.|$|E
25|$|Mechanisms of {{resistance}} {{have been studied}} by several authors in different animal species.

It has been established that cattle acquire resistance to challenge infection with F. hepatica and F. gigantica when they have been <b>sensitized</b> with primary patent or drug-abbreviated infection. Resistance to fasciolosis was also documented in rats. On the other hand, sheep and goats are not resistant to re-infection with F. hepatica.
