500|$|In 2008, {{while working}} on several films, A. R. Rahman {{received}} an email from Danny Boyle, {{the director of the}} film Slumdog Millionaire, stating: [...] "Hey I'm Danny Boyle, I like your work, and it would be great for us to have you on our film". Rahman was unsure how to answer, but after exchanging several more emails, they met in Mumbai. Rahman summarized their first meeting by saying [...] "when I talked to him, I had some interest and I wanted to see the film. He had a first cut of the film already, and when I saw that I was really interested and wanted to do it. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> another film to do this one. I made time for it".|$|E
500|$|In July 1856, Smetana {{received}} news of {{the death}} in exile of his revolutionary friend Karel Havlíček. The political climate in Prague was a further source of gloom; hopes of a more enlightened government and social reform following Franz Joseph's accession in 1848 had faded as Austrian absolutism reasserted itself under Baron Alexander von Bach. Despite the good name of the Piano Institute, Smetana's status as a concert pianist was {{generally considered to be}} below that of contemporaries such as Alexander Dreyschock. Critics acknowledged Smetana's [...] "delicate, crystalline touch", closer in style to Chopin than Liszt, but believed that his physical frailty was a serious drawback to his concert-playing ambitions. His main performance success during this period was his playing of Mozart's D minor Piano Concerto at a concert celebrating the centenary of Mozart's birth, in January 1856. His disenchantment with Prague was growing and, perhaps influenced by Dreyschock's accounts of opportunities to be found in Sweden, Smetana decided to seek success there. On 11October 1856, after writing to his parents that [...] "Prague did not wish to acknowledge me, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> it", he departed for Gothenburg.|$|E
500|$|On 30 March 2005 the BBC {{confirmed}} that Eccleston {{would not be}} staying in the role for a second series, claiming that he was scared of being typecast. On 4 April they admitted that this statement had been made without consulting the actor, and were forced to apologise. Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post in 2010, Eccleston denied that he left due to fear of being typecast. He stated that he [...] "didn't enjoy {{the environment and the}} culture that we, the cast and crew, had to work in" [...] and {{that he did not want}} to do any more based on the experience. He said, [...] "I wasn't comfortable. I thought 'If I stay in this job, I'm going to have to blind myself to certain things that I thought were wrong.' And I think it's more important to be your own man than be successful, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>left.</b> But the most important thing is that I did it, not that I left. I really feel that, because it kind of broke the mould and it helped to reinvent it. I'm very proud of it." [...] According to the Sunday Mirror, an interview for BBC's Doctor Who website that was taken down after his departure revealed that Eccleston had planned to stay for two or three more years. In March 2013 a source for the BBC indicated that Eccleston had discussed plans for Doctor Whos 50th anniversary special, which aired in November 2013, with Davies' successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat. After consideration, he decided not to return to the series. Had he returned, his incarnation would have played the role that ultimately became the War Doctor, portrayed by John Hurt.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> was <b>left</b> alone, and, {{extraordinary}} {{as it may}} seem, I {{was asleep}} in less than half an hour.|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> was <b>left</b> {{to my own}} devices, {{and soon}} found a {{comfortable}} seat, {{at the foot of}} a tree, from which I had a good view of the ruins.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly {{she is very}} angry," [...] I said, [...] "or {{at least}} was <b>so</b> when <b>I</b> <b>left</b> her last night. Oh! Bes, why did you let your people {{tell her that she}} was ugly?" ...|$|R
2500|$|They {{separated}} on 5 August 1972. It is {{not clear}} what made them part their ways. On being asked the reason for their parting, O P Nayyar once said, [...] "I know astrology very well. I knew that one day I had to part with her. Something also happened that upset me, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> her." [...] Nevertheless, he also said [...] "...now that I am seventy-six, I can say that {{the most important person in}} my life was Asha Bhosle. She was the best person I ever met." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bruce {{was born}} on 14 May 1943 in Bishopbriggs, Lanarkshire, to Betty (Asher) and Charlie Bruce, musical parents who moved frequently, {{resulting}} in the young Bruce attending 14 different schools, ending up at Bellahouston Academy. He began playing the jazz bass in his teens and won a scholarship to study cello and musical composition at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama while playing in Jim McHarg's Scotsville Jazzband to support himself. The academy disapproved of its students playing jazz. [...] "They found out", Bruce told Musician correspondent Jim Macnie, [...] "and said 'you either stop, or leave college.' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> college." ...|$|E
2500|$|The writer admits; [...] "I sought fame, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> {{the village}} green." [...] But he has somewhere to return to; [...] "I'll take you where real animals are playing, {{and people are}} real people not just playing. It's a quiet, quiet life". The village green offers a place to be natural, a place of solitude, while the [...] "city" [...] offers only artifice, haste, {{competition}} and {{the dangers of the}} Cold War. The animal farm, Ray Davies said, [...] "was just me thinking everybody else is mad and we are all animals anyway – which is really the idea of the whole album." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] he answered. [...] "But I was young, and {{my career}} was just beginning. The thing stunned me. She insisted upon secrecy. It would reflect upon her, she thought, {{if the truth}} came out, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> acquiesced, <b>I</b> <b>left</b> the house unseen. All these days I have had to carry the burden of this thing with me. To-day--seemed to be the climax. For the first time I understood." ...|$|R
60|$|And now, adieu! Be a {{good husband}} to Gabriel, and, if your sister be brave enough to marry into such a devil-ridden family as ours, by all means let her do <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> have <b>left</b> enough to keep my poor wife in comfort.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{been gone}} long, doctor," [...] said Rand feverishly, [...] "and she looked <b>SO</b> death-like when <b>I</b> <b>left.</b> If {{we should be}} too late!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Her {{career began}} with blackface comedy at local clubs; {{this was the}} [...] "entertainment" [...] of which her mother had disapproved, however these {{performances}} landed Baker an opportunity to tour in Paris, which would become the place she called home until her final days. In the United States, Baker was often faced with rejection due to her race: [...] "One day I realized I {{was living in a}} country where I was afraid to be black. It was only a country for white people. Not black. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>left.</b> I had been suffocating in the United States.... A lot of us left, not because we wanted to leave, but because we couldn't stand it anymore.... I felt liberated in Paris." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 11 May, it was {{announced}} that Farage would continue to serve as the party’s leader, with the BBC reporting: [...] "Party chairman Steve Crowther said the national executive committee believed the election campaign had been a ‘great success’ and members had ‘unanimously’ rejected Mr Farage's letter of resignation". Interviewed about his continued leadership by the BBC the following day, Farage said: [...] "I resigned. I said I'd resign. I turned up to the NEC meeting with letter in hand fully intending to carry that through. They unanimously said they didn't want me to do that, they presented me with petitions, signatures, statements from candidates saying it would be a bad thing for UKIP. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> the meeting, went and sat in darkened room to think about what to do, and decided for the interest of the party I would accept their kind offer for me to stay and tear up the letter." [...] He added that he would consider standing for parliament again should a by-election be called in a Labour-held seat.|$|E
2500|$|Off-screen, actress Lucy Speed {{had decided}} to leave the serial after playing Natalie for a year, as she was {{reportedly}} “freaked out” by the media attention she was receiving from being in such a high-profile show. In an interview with the ‘’Walford Gazette’’, Speed commented: “I was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and {{you have to learn to}} deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me…But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on…they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> on good terms with them…I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!” ...|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> saying, <b>I</b> <b>left</b> {{the cabin}} and the ship, but {{with the weight of}} trouble that lay upon my mind {{anything}} but lightened, for I could not understand why, we all being in this peril together, neither he nor the Ostend captain had spoken a single word concerning our defence.|$|R
6000|$|... "How should I know?" [...] {{returned}} the son sharply; [...] "they dropped off--wan here an' wan there--sayin' {{they would try}} for a buffalo in wan place or another, or, that they would rest awhile; an' <b>so</b> <b>I</b> wass <b>left</b> by myself. <b>I</b> found it quite enough to look efter number wan." ...|$|R
60|$|My cosmopolite made a large adieu {{and left}} me, for {{he thought he}} saw some one through the chatter and smoke whom he knew. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> was <b>left</b> with the would-be periwinkle, who was reduced to Würzburger without further ability to voice his {{aspirations}} to perch, melodious, upon the summit of a valley.|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> Mariani, {{and moved}} swiftly and silently {{to the head}} of the staircase.|$|E
60|$|But {{the poor}} creatures were aghast. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> {{them to their}} fate, {{and went up to}} the nearest Salvation Army man.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> her {{somewhat}} comforted, {{knowing how}} sound was her judgment, {{and went off}} to make my preparations for the expedition to Sikonyela's country.|$|E
5000|$|Margot Fonteyn: [...] "I cannot {{even begin}} to talk about Ulanova's dancing, it is <b>so</b> marvellous, <b>I</b> am <b>left</b> speechless. It is magic. Now {{we know what we}} lack." ...|$|R
60|$|Louis endeavoured and translated. In other words, he descended {{immediately}} into a bottomless pit of confusion, and the Young Person {{followed him}} down. I really don't know when <b>I</b> have been <b>so</b> amused. <b>I</b> <b>left</b> {{them at the}} bottom of the pit as long as they diverted me. When they ceased to divert me, I exerted my intelligence, and pulled them up again.|$|R
5000|$|When Green saw a {{rough cut}} of the film, {{she said she was}} [...] "quite shocked" [...] and had to look away during the sex scenes; she later told an {{interviewer}} that for her, [...] "it was as though I was wearing a costume while we were making the film. It was as if I had another story in my mind. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> was <b>left</b> speechless." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! {{you have}} helped me to the very word I wanted. I fancied {{it was not in}} earnest, like the one I got, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> the job half finished." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't {{stop when}} I heard at Clipstone that Angel was here, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> Phyllis {{and the kid}} with her mother. Oh, Angel, Angel, to meet at Bexley after all!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{explanation}} {{is simple and}} short," [...] replied the boy; [...] "I wanted to have my own way, like most other boys, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> home without leave, or saying farewell." ...|$|E
60|$|It was all grass {{clear to}} the canoe, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> hadn't <b>left</b> a track. <b>I</b> {{followed}} around to see. I stood on the bank and {{looked out over the}} river. All safe. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> took the gun and went up a piece into the woods, and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind about}} that, Dick," [...] he answered. [...] "Call it a whim or {{anything}} else you like. The fact is that Cecil had some guests coming whom I did not particularly care to meet, and who certainly {{would not have been}} interested in me. I thought {{it would be best to}} clear out altogether, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> have <b>left</b> Cecil in possession of the Hall, and they don't even know that I exist." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{happened}} after that, {{you know as}} well as I do. I may get on to the next morning--the morning when <b>I</b> <b>so</b> ungratefully <b>left</b> you at the inn by the river-side.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Mistake o' Bill's,' ses 'Arry, {{pointing}} to me. 'I told 'im I thought 'e was wrong, but 'e would 'ave it. I've {{got a bad}} memory, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> it to 'im.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now then!" [...] cried Richard from within. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> Charley in {{the little}} passage, and going on to the half-open door, said, [...] "Can I come in, Richard? It's only Dame Durden." ...|$|E
60|$|And so, in truth, {{it turned}} out. I had {{aimed at the}} bull and hit the leopard. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> that spot not a little pleased with my bad aim and my good fortune.|$|E
6000|$|My {{uncle had}} ridden out early, {{for he was}} {{to take part in}} the new mayor's state visit to church in the {{manufacturing}} town, and even Alice seemed out of spirits, <b>so</b> when <b>I</b> <b>left</b> the library there was the weary afternoon to be dragged through somehow. It passed very slowly, and then as I stood by the stables a man from the house at the further end of the valley, where Colonel Carrington was staying, said to our stable lad: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You're {{not going}} to take my clothes!' I said, {{springing}} out of bed. Matteo gathered up in his arms various garments and rushed out of the room, slamming the door and locking it on the outside, <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> was <b>left</b> shut in, helpless.|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> {{there was}} <b>I,</b> <b>left</b> {{alone in my}} glory at Falesá; and when the {{schooner}} came round I filled her up, {{and gave her a}} deck-cargo half as high as the house. I must say Mr. Tarleton did the right thing by us; but he took a meanish kind of a revenge.|$|R
