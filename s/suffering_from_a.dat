5|$|Attitudes {{and social}} {{stereotypes}} can create {{barriers to the}} detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This {{is more of a}} barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic. In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to suspect that a man they know is an alcoholic.|$|E

5|$|Comics {{historian}} Peter Sanderson {{compares the}} 1960s DC {{to a large}} Hollywood studio, and argues that after having reinvented the superhero archetype, DC by {{the latter part of}} the decade was <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> creative drought. The audience for comics was no longer just children, and Sanderson sees the 1960s Marvel as the comic equivalent of the French New Wave, developing new methods of storytelling that drew in and retained readers who were in their teens and older and thus influencing the comics writers and artists of the future.|$|E

This has prompted some economists such as Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman to note that Europe is not <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> sovereign debt crisis but rather from a banking crisis.|$|E
