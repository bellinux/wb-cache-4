25|$|In {{spite of}} the spirit and intent of the Convention as {{conveyed}} by the Convention itself and further reinforced by the Perez-Vera report, Article 13b is frequently used by abductors {{as a vehicle to}} litigate the child's best interests or custody. Although Article 13(b) inquiries are not intended to deal with issues or factual questions appropriate for custody proceedings, many countries use article 13b to request psychological profiles, detailed evaluations of parental fitness, evidence concerning lifestyle and the nature and quality of relationships. These misinterpretations of the Abduction Convention's exceptions have rendered the Convention largely ineffective in accomplishing its objectives. The best interests of a child, which is explicitly never mentioned in the Convention, is an essentially <b>subjective</b> <b>standard</b> that judges often use to facilitate foreign nations' manipulation of the treaty and create a pretext for discretionary decisions. This discretion often takes the form of gender, cultural and national biases. The result is substantive non-compliance with the Abduction Convention.|$|E
2500|$|He went on {{to reject}} the notion of {{changing}} the entrapment standard, saying the Court had already reaffirmed the subjective test in Sherman and {{saw no reason to}} change now. He reiterated previous justices' argument against it from those decisions, and rapped the lower court: [...] "We think that the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case quite unnecessarily introduces an unmanageably <b>subjective</b> <b>standard</b> which is contrary to the holdings of this Court in Sorrells and Sherman ... here are circumstances when the use of deceit is the only practicable law enforcement technique available. It is only when the Government's deception actually implants the criminal design {{in the mind of the}} defendant that the defense of entrapment comes into play." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Court's [...] "commitment to Apprendi in {{this context}} {{reflects}} not just respect for longstanding precedent, but the need to give intelligible content {{to the right of}} jury trial. [...] That right is no procedural formality, but a fundamental reservation of power in our constitutional structure." [...] Just as citizens participate in the legislative process by electing representatives to the legislature, they participate in the judicial process by serving on juries. [...] The Apprendi rule ensures that [...] "the judge's authority to sentence derives wholly from the jury's verdict. [...] Without that restriction, the jury would not exercise the control that the Framers intended." [...] Justice Scalia, as the author of the majority opinion, reasoned that those who reject [...] Apprendi [...] "are resigned to one of two alternatives." [...] First, a jury might be allowed only to pass on a small part of criminal activity, and then allow the judge to determine the punishment for the full range of conduct the government seeks to punish, as by letting the jury determine whether an accused murderer illegally possessed a firearm and then allowing the judge to impose a life sentence because the defendant had used the firearm to kill someone. [...] Second, the legislature could establish judicial limits that were not too excessive, a necessarily <b>subjective</b> <b>standard</b> that would be hard for the Court to monitor and adjust as necessary. [...] But this claim was not plausible, since the entire purpose of the jury-trial requirement was to check judicial authority.|$|E

50|$|The <b>subjective</b> <b>standard</b> and {{objective}} standard are legal standards for knowledge or beliefs of {{a defendant in}} a criminal law case. An objective standard of reasonableness requires the finder of fact to view the circumstances {{from the standpoint of}} a hypothetical reasonable person, absent the unique particular physical and psychological characteristics of the defendant. A <b>subjective</b> <b>standard</b> of reasonableness asks whether the circumstances would produce an honest and reasonable belief in a person having the particular mental and physical characteristics of the defendant, such as their personal knowledge and personal history, when the same circumstances might not produce the same in a general reasonable person.|$|E

Respondents compare their current circumstances against <b>subjective</b> <b>standards</b> to arrive at a global appraisal of life satisfaction (Diener 2000). Participants are presented with five separate questions with seven response alternatives (e.g., “In most ways my life is close to ideal”; “The conditions of my life are excellent”).

40|$|Frequency of {{behaviour}} {{is often}} assessed by scales using relative frequencies such as `often` or `rarely`, so-called vague quantifiers. Previous research showed that respondents calibrate such scales according to <b>subjective</b> <b>standards.</b> Here, {{it is argued}} that respondents follow conversational norms and if possible try to figure out which calibration the researcher had in mind and adapt their responses accordingly. They may use the survey context to infer a relevant anchor for such vague quantifiers. In the present study, although respondents did not differ in absolute behaviour frequencies, their reports of relative frequencies were influenced by information about the target population and the topic of the survey. Apparently, respondents anchored the scale according to the estimated frequency in the target population and the frequency of other behaviours relevant to the topic of the survey.

40|$|In 2007, {{the media}} and {{entertainment}} field amounted to a $ 930 billion industry. The film industry brought in $ 10. 2 billion, and the video game industry brought in $ 7. 4 billion in U. S. revenues. The advent of the Internet and other technological developments has created new platforms for, and transformed the meaning of, entertainment for a more globalized audience. No longer are American or foreign audiences confined to entertainment in their respective countries. Global audiences continue to broaden their international tastes, creating a culturally diverse demand and market for more international performers. From music to advertising, individuals focus on secular appeal. As the demand increases for global appeal in the entertainment arena, so too has the demand for foreign artists. Foreign-born artists like Rihanna, Jude Law and Yo-Yo Ma are from diverse countries and entertainment genres; yet they {{have one thing in}} common: they all need O-visas to enter into and perform in the United States. In 2010 alone, 63, 984 foreign artists and personnel entered the U. S. on an O-visa. With the passage of the Immigration Act of 1990, Congress created the O- and P- visa categories for entertainers and artists. Congress viewed these visa categories as exceptional ones for extraordinary artists in their respective fields. Whether the United States grants an O-visa depends heavily on <b>subjective</b> <b>standards</b> and input from several different U. S. institutions: law firms, artist labor unions, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the Department of State (which includes consulates and embassies). The inconsistent standards implemented by each of these institutions pose administrative issues in the application process. These problems have a chilling effect on bringing talented individuals into the United States. Examining the <b>subjective</b> <b>standards</b> delineated throughout the application process reveals that the labor unions and bureaucratic requirements ultimately create barriers that prevent talented, international artists from entering the United States. This has heavy ramifications on the United States’ intercultural, global presence. Modifying the visa petition process to create a more uniform procedure will ultimately enhance the arts domestically and will reposition American public diplomacy and interests around the globe...|$|R

50|$|From 1806, till {{his death}} Böckh's {{literary}} activity was unceasing. His principal works include an edition of Pindar, {{the first volume}} of which (1811) contains the text of the Epinician odes; a treatise, De Metris Pindari, in three books; and Notae Criticae: the second (1819) contains the Scholia; and part ii. of volume ii. (1821) contains a Latin translation, a commentary, the fragments and indices. It was for a long time the most complete edition of Pindar. But it was especially the treatise on the metres which placed Böckh in the first rank of scholars. This treatise forms an epoch in the treatment of the subject. In it the author threw aside all attempts to determine the Greek metres by mere <b>subjective</b> <b>standards,</b> pointing out {{at the same time the}} close connection between the music and the poetry of the Greeks. He investigated minutely the nature of Greek music as far as it can be ascertained, as well as all the details regarding Greek musical instruments; and he explained the statements of the ancient Greek writers on rhythm. In this manner he laid the foundation for a scientific treatment of Greek metres.|$|R
