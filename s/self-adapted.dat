40|$|The {{approach}} of tracking maneuvering targets {{based on the}} “Current” Statistical (CS) model is widely used. The method needs to preset maneuvering frequency and maximum acceleration based on experience. In practice, the preset values are often {{not consistent with the}} actual moving state of targets and result in larger tracking errors. In order to tackle the problem, this paper initially deduces a <b>self-adapting</b> maneuvering frequency algorithm from the discrete state equation of the CS model. Then, an improved <b>self-adapting</b> acceleration covariance algorithm is presented. Simulation results show that, by using the <b>self-adapting</b> maneuvering frequency algorithm and the improved <b>self-adapting</b> acceleration covariance algorithm to track targets simultaneously, the ability to <b>self-adapt</b> to the fluctuation of the moving state will be improved.

40|$|Floquet {{dynamics}} of a quantum system subject to periodic modulations of system parameters provide {{a powerful tool}} for engineering new quantum matter with exotic properties. While system dynamics are significantly altered, the periodic modulation itself is usually induced externally and independent of Floquet dynamics. Here we propose a new type of Floquet physics for a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) subject to a shaken lattice generated inside a cavity, where the shaken lattice and atomic Floquet bands are mutually dependent, resulting in <b>self-adapted</b> Floquet dynamics. In particular, the shaken lattice induces Floquet quasi-energy bands for the BEC, whose back action leads to a <b>self-adapted</b> dynamical normal-superradiant phase transition for the shaken lattice. Such <b>self-adapted</b> Floquet dynamics show two surprising and unique features: i) the normal-superradiant phase transition possesses a hysteresis even without atom interactions; ii) the dynamical atom-cavity steady state could exist at free energy maxima. The atom interactions strongly affect the phase transition of the BEC from zero to finite momenta. Our results provide a powerful platform for exploring <b>self-adapted</b> Floquet dynamics, which may open an avenue for engineering novel quantum materials. Comment: 10 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a psychometric model for estimating ability and item-selection strategies in <b>self-adapted</b> testing. In contrast to computer adaptive testing, in <b>self-adapted</b> testing the examinees {{are allowed to}} select {{the difficulty of the}} items. The item-selection strategy is defined as the distribution of difficulty conditional on the responses given to previous items. The article shows that missing responses in <b>self-adapted</b> testing are missing at random and can be ignored in the estima-tion of ability. However, the item-selection strategy cannot always be ignored in such an estimation. An EM algorithm is presented to estimate an examinee’s abil-ity and strategies, and a model fit is evaluated using Akaike’s information crite-rion. The article includes an application with real data to illustrate how the model can be used in practice for evaluating hypotheses, estimating ability, and identi-fying strategies.

The dynamic properties of the photorefractive effect make this Fabry–Perot continuously adapted to the oscillating modes. Its spectral reflectivity reinforces the competition between these modes which, in some cases, leads to a single-mode operation.

40|$|Abstract:- Although the Differential Evolution (DE) {{algorithm}} {{has been}} shown to be a simple yet powerful evolutionary algorithm for optimizing continuous functions, users are still faced with the problem of preliminary testing and hand-tuning of the evolutionary parameters prior to commencing the actual optimization process. As a solution, self-adaptation has been found to be highly beneficial in automatically and dynamically adjusting evolutionary parameters such as crossover rates and mutation rates. In this paper, we present a first attempt at <b>self-adapting</b> the population size parameter in addition to <b>self-adapting</b> crossover and mutation rates. Firstly, our main objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of <b>self-adapting</b> the population size parameter in DE. Using the F 1 -F 5 benchmark test problems proposed by De Jong, we showed that DE with self-adaptive populations produced highly competitive results compared to a conventional DE algorithm with static populations. In addition to reducing the number of parameters used in DE, the proposed algorithm actually outperformed the conventional DE algorithm for one of the test problems. It was also found that that an absolute encoding methodology for <b>self-adapting</b> population size in DE produced results with greater optimization reliability compared to a relative encoding methodology...|$|R
