40|$|Internet traffic {{classification}} gained significant {{attention in the}} last few years. Most of the current classification methods were only valid for offline classification. The three common classification methods i. e. port, payload and statistics based have some limitations. This paper exploits the advantages of all the three methods by combining them to produce a new classification algorithm called SSPC (Signature <b>Statistical</b> <b>Port</b> Classifier). In the proposed algorithm, each of the three classifiers will individually classify the same traffic flow. Based on certain priority rules, SSPC makes classification decisions for each flow. The SSPC algorithm was used to classifying four types of Internet applications in two stages, initially offline and later online. The results of both cases show that SSPC is the higher accuracy when compared with other classifiers. In addition, as demonstrated in the real time online experiments done, SSPC algorithm uses a short time to classify traffic and thus it is suitable to be used for online classification...|$|E

40|$|Starting from {{morphology}} and equipment, {{a synthetic}} method {{able to provide}} with indicators representing the ports' performances was setup. The knowledge basis, built on cartography, <b>statistical</b> data, <b>port</b> master plans, sectorial researches, required important efforts in terms of integration and homogenisation. The method's development is basing on a survey extended to the Mediterranean basin, progressively identifying a sample of ports by additive selection criteria, including geographical location, layout's morphology, traffic typologies, consistent data availability. A set of indicators characterising ports' performances allows benchmarking and matching to derive useful design and operational feedback. The achieved results include homogeneous indicators for dimensions, equipment and performances, useful for design and planning purposes, operational check, identification of bottlenecks and project needs. The extension of the sample (39 study cases in the Mediterranean basin) entrusts the values of results. Interesting maps and thematic analysis deals with wharfs' extension vs. sea depth and basin surface, length of route, docks' density, ships turnover rate, productivity index, docks utilisation, approaching time. Moreover, the global operational capacity and the related present utilisation rate was calculated taking into account internal routes' network, compatibility among routes, manoeuvring times, distribution of traffic by route...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) on patterns of failure and survivals in uterine carcinosarcoma patients treated with radical surgery. Materials and Methods: Between October 1998 and August 2010, 19 patients with stage I–III uterine carcinosarcoma received curative hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with or without PORT at Seoul National University Hospital. Their hospital medical records were retrospectively reviewed. PORT and non-PORT groups included 11 and 8 patients, respectively. They were followed for a mean of 22. 7 months (range, 7. 8 to 126. 6 months). Results: At 5 years, the overall survival rates were 51. 9 % for entire, 61. 4 % for PORT, and 41. 7 % for non-PORT groups, respectively. There was no <b>statistical</b> difference between <b>PORT</b> and non-PORT groups with regard to overall survival (p = 0. 682). Seven out of 19 (36. 8 %) patients showed treatment failures, which all happened within 12 months. Although the predominant failures were distant metastasis in PORT group and loco-regional recurrence in non-PORT group, there was {{no statistically significant difference}} in loco-regional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) (p = 0. 362) or distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (p = 0. 548). Lymph node metastasis was found to be a significant prognostic factor in predicting poor LRRFS (p = 0. 013) and DMFS (p = 0. 021), while the International Federation Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (p = 0. 043) was associated with LRRFS.

40|$|Context and Aims: Our study aims to {{evaluate}} the post-operative pain and cosmesis of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) {{in comparison with the}} standard, 3 -port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SLC) with respect to the length of incision, cosmetic scores, post-operative pain scores and duration of hospital stay. Settings and Design: This comparative randomised study was conducted in a tertiary care centre teaching hospital between September 2012 and 2014. One hundred and fifty consecutive patients, who qualified as per inclusion criteria, were included in the study. Subjects and Methods: Seventy-five patients were included in the SLC arm and 75 in the SILC arm. SILC procedure was carried out as transumbilical multiport technique and SLC as 3 -port technique utilizing - 5, 5, 10 mm <b>ports.</b> <b>Statistical</b> Analysis Used: The data for the primary observations (post-operative pain scores, cosmetic score and incision length) and secondary observation (post-operative hospital stay) were noted. Weighted mean difference was used for calculation of quantitative variables, and odds ratios were used for pooling qualitative variables. Results: Pain scores at 4 and 24 h were significantly better for SILC arm than SLC arm (at 4 h - 4. 84 ± 0. 95 vs. 6. 17 ± 0. 98, P 0. 05. Discussion: Significant difference was found in duration and intensity of pain between two procedures at 4 and 24 h. Cosmesis was significantly better in SILC than SLC group, the sample size in our study was small to arrive at a definite conclusion. The procedure can be selectively and judiciously performed by surgeons trained in regular laparoscopic surgery. Furthermore, the threshold for conversion should be low in learning phase.

40|$|In recent years, {{container}} {{security at}} nodes {{in the international}} supply chains such as inland dry ports {{has become a major}} concern on the international maritime agenda. If security measures and initiatives are not carefully designed and effectively implemented, they can negatively impact the entire maritime transport chain. Yet, there are limited studies conducted on this subject. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by devising a framework for measuring the quality of container security at dry ports by conducting an empirical study to verify the quality of container security at 26 Indian dry ports. The study was conducted by using the triangulation of both mail survey and in-depth interview techniques. It was evident from this study that the standards of container security at the said dry ports left much to be desired. The paper also analyses the reasons for such abysmal level of container security at the dry <b>ports.</b> <b>Statistical</b> analysis employed in this paper reveal that there is a clear consensus amongst all the respondents that quality of container security at dry ports is a construct consisting of five dimensions, namely, equipment, personnel, policy and planning, drills and training, and security audit. In the context of Indian dry ports, the quality gaps of container security service are currently related to policy and planning, as well as security equipment. The paper also argues that the positive outcomes of container security at dry ports could be realized only if the dry ports employ effective container secwity management stmtegies. Finally, academic and manage 1 ial implications are explained and future research directions along this research area will be outlined...|$|R

40|$|Ports compete {{not only}} on the sea-side (e. g. through {{terminal}} investments, increase in terminal efficiency, maritime service connectivity) but also on the land-side (e. g. through logistics chain, advanced IT services, door-to-door connectivity). On this issue, several studies (e. g. Meersman et al., 2009; Tongzon, 2009) recently pointed out the increasing importance of the connectivity – at both quality and quantity level – between the port and its own hinterland in order to be competitive in the modern maritime service structure. The analysis concentrates on the study of the port hinterland contestability and on the definition of the catchment area focusing on a case study (i. e. the Adriatic ports aiming at attracting the Southern German freight flows) in order to better understand which elements affect the possibility to expand the current ports’ hinterland. The empirical research is based on public statistics (e. g. Eurostat, Amadeus database) and on data directly collected from the operators currently serving Southern German firms with the main commercial ports and with the potential port actors that may be interested in an enlargement of the port catchment area in the studied region (e. g. South European ports). Apart from the trade pattern analysis – based on the general statistics – and the logistics structure analysis – based on the information collected by transport and logistics operators –, a direct survey has been conducted on a sample of manufacturing companies located in Southern Germany and Western Austria in order to understand what actions should be taken in order to promote the use of Adriatic ports and then reshape the boundaries of the catchment areas of these <b>ports.</b> <b>Statistical</b> tools and a bottom-up approach have been developed in order to evaluate the results. Main findings are then related to potential strategies that may fill in the competitive gap between Northern and Southern European ports when they compete to serve the same hinterland. The original contribution of the research is an insight on the relative importance of the infrastructure endowment, the generalized transport cost and also of some non-monetary conditions – as cultural and behavioural aspects – that have an influence in determining the effective boundaries of ports’ hinterland...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: In 1987, {{the autopsy}} of a vibroa-coustic disease (VAD) patient {{disclosed}} two tumours: a {{renal cell carcinoma}} and a malignant glioma in the brain. Since 1987, malignancy in VAD patients has been under close surveillance. To date, in a universe of 945 individuals, there are 46 cases of malignancies, of which 11 are multiple. Of the 11 cases of respiratory tract tumours, all were squamous cell carcinomas (SqCC). This report focuses on the morphological features of these tumours. Methods: Tumour fragments were collected (endoscopic biopsy or surgery) from 11 male VAD patients (ave. age: 58 ± 9 years, 3 non-smokers) : 2 in glottis and 9 in the lung. In the 3 non-smokers, 2 had lung tumours and 1 had a glottis tumour. All were employed as or retired aircraft technicians, military or commercial pilots. Fragments were fixed either for light and electron microscopy. Immunohistochemistry studies used chromagranine and synaptophysine staining. Results: All lung tumours were located in the upper right lobe bron-chi and were histologically poorly differentiated SqCC (Figs. 1, 2). The search with neuroendocrine markers was negative. The average age of tumour onset in helicopter pilots was below 50 years old while for the other professional groups it was above 50. Nine patients are deceased. The 2 surviving patients are heavy smokers (> 2 packs/day). Smoking habits had no influence on tumour outcome and progression. Discussion: Epidemiological studies indicate that squamous cell carcinomas account for approximately 40 % of all lung tumours in men. It seems to be highly relevant that all VAD patient respiratory tract tumours are squamous cell carcinomas. It {{is not surprising that}} helicopter pilots {{are the ones who are}} affected the earliest because previous studies have shown that helicopter pilots exhibited the highest values for the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges. Generally, epidemiological tumor studies do not take histological tumor type into account, but given the results herein, it would seem of the utmost importance to begin specifiying the exact histological type of tumor in all <b>statistical</b> studies.
