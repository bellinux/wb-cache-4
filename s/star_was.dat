5|$|HD 205739's {{designation}} is {{from the}} Henry Draper catalogue. The <b>star</b> <b>was</b> also observed by Hipparcos, which released its catalogue in 1997. The observations {{that led to the}} discovery of the planet HD 205739 b started when the N2K Consortium started an extended search for planets around 300 stars not usually targeted by Doppler spectroscopy surveys. In the case of HD 205739, the <b>star</b> <b>was</b> observed using the Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. HD 205739 was selected primarily because it was a metal-rich star; the N2K collaboration biased their search towards metal-rich stars with closely orbiting Jupiter-size planets, hoping to find a connection between a star's metallicity and its planets' masses.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Order of Karađorđe's <b>Star</b> <b>was</b> {{categorized}} {{as a senior}} state award, and organized into four classes. The Grand Cross of Karađorđe's Star, the highest class, consisted of a badge of the Order on a sash and breast star; a Grand Officer of Karađorđe's <b>Star</b> <b>was</b> decorated with a badge necklet and a slightly smaller breast star; a Commander of Karađorđe's <b>Star</b> <b>was</b> only awarded a badge necklet; and {{the recipient of the}} Order's fourth class, the Officer of Karađorđe's Star, would receive a small triangular chest ribbon. The Order was usually awarded for services to the Karađorđević dynasty, the Serbian state or the Serb people, while Karađorđević princes received a Grand Cross at baptism. Recipients included both soldiers and civilians, though until 1906 only Serbian citizens were permitted to receive the award.|$|E

5|$|WASP-13 {{is a star}} in the Lynx constellation. The star is similar, {{in terms}} of {{metallicity}} and mass, to the Sun, although it is hotter and most likely older. The <b>star</b> <b>was</b> first observed in 1997, according to the SIMBAD database, and was targeted by SuperWASP after the <b>star</b> <b>was</b> observed by one of the SuperWASP telescopes beginning in 2006. Follow-up observations on the star led to the discovery of planet WASP-13b in 2008; the discovery paper was published in 2009.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that most visible <b>stars</b> <b>are</b> binary: they have a nearby {{companion}} star, and these two stars orbit around each other.
