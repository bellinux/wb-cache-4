25|$|<b>Sulbutiamine</b> (brand name: Arcalion) is a {{synthetic}} derivative of thiamine (vitamin B1). As a dimer of two modified thiamine molecules, it is a lipophilic compound that crosses the bloodâ€“brain barrier {{more readily than}} thiamine and increases the levels of thiamine and thiamine phosphate esters in the brain. <b>Sulbutiamine</b> was discovered in Japan {{in an effort to}} develop more useful thiamine derivatives since it was hoped that increasing the lipophilicity of thiamine would result in better pharmacokinetic properties.|$|E
25|$|The first {{lipophilic}} thiamine derivative to {{be discovered}} was allithiamine, which was isolated from garlic (Allium sativum) in 1951. Allithiamine is an allyl disulfide derivative.

Thiamine is unable to diffuse across plasma membranes because it has a positively charged thiazole moiety.

40|$|Asthenia is {{the most}} {{frequent}} medical reason for people seeking help from their physician. In 75 % of cases, the cause is functional (either reactive or psychiatric) and in 25 % it is organic. In order to provide patients with rapid relief of symptoms, appropriate antiasthenic treatment should be initiated immediately, {{while at the same}} time, adequate clinical and laboratory assessments should be performed to detect the underlying cause of asthenia. <b>Sulbutiamine,</b> a highly lipophilic thiamine derivative, is the only antiasthenic compound known to cross the blood-brain barrier and to be selectively active on specific brain structures directly involved in asthenia.

40|$|Incubation of rat brain homogenates with {{thiamine}} or {{thiamine diphosphate}} (TDP) {{leads to a}} synthesis of thiamine triphosphate (TTP).

40|$|Thiamine {{transport}} in cultured neuroblastoma {{cells is}} mediated by a high-affinity carrier (KM = 40 nM). In contrast, the uptake {{of the more}} hydrophobic <b>sulbutiamine</b> (isobutyrylthiamine disulfide) is unsaturable and its initial transport rate is 20 -times faster than for thiamine. In the cytoplasm, <b>sulbutiamine</b> is rapidly hydrolyzed and reduced to free thiamine, the overall process resulting in a rapid and concentrative thiamine accumulation. Incorporation of radioactivity from [14 C]thiamine or [14 C]sulbutiamine into intracellular thiamine diphosphate is slow in both cases. Despite {{the fact that the}} diphosphate is probably the direct precursor for both thiamine monophosphate and triphosphate, the specific radioactivity increased much faster for the latter two compounds than for thiamine diphosphate. This suggests the existence of two pools of thiamine diphosphate, the larger one having a very slow turnover (about 17 h); a much smaller, rapidly turning over pool would be the precursor of thiamine mono- and triphosphate. The turnover time for thiamine triphosphate could be estimated to be 1 - 2 h. When preloading the cells with [14 C]sulbutiamine was followed by a chase with the same concentration of the unlabeled compound, the specific radioactivities of thiamine and thiamine monophosphate decreased exponentially as expected, but labeling of the diphosphate continued to increase slowly. Specific radioactivity of thiamine triphosphate increased first, but after 30 min it began to slowly decrease. These results show {{for the first time the}} existence of distinct thiamine diphosphate pools in the same homogeneous cell population. They also suggest a complex compartmentation of thiamine metabolism. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Ganglion {{cell death}} in {{glaucoma}} {{is caused by}} a variety of insults that include ischemia, insufficient neurotrophic support and oxidative stress. Experimental studies were therefore conducted on cell cultures to determine how serum deprivation (to mimic insufficient neurotrophic support) or oxidative glutamate toxicity (GB), cause oxidative stress and induce retinal cell death. Moreover, studies were carried out to deduce whether selected sulphur containing compounds can blunt any negative influences to cells in culture and/or a defined ischaemic insult to the rat retina in situ, as this might suggest their use for the treatment of glaucoma. Serum deprivation and GB caused generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis-like death to transformed retinal ganglion cells (RGC- 5 cells). RGC- 5 cells were more susceptible to the detrimental effects of GB than serum deprivation. RGC- 5 cells subjected to serum deprivation appear to die by mechanisms that resemble classical apoptosis more closely than that caused by GB and the phase between the maximal generation of ROS and cell death were different. Cell death caused by serum deprivation was caspase-dependent but {{this was not the case}} for GB. Moreover, of the two sulphur compounds <b>sulbutiamine</b> and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), <b>sulbutiamine</b> blunts the effect of serum deprivation more effectively. In addition, the pan caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk attenuated the negative effect of serum deprivation to RGC- 5 cells while the necroptosis inhibitor (necrostsatin- 1) counteracted solely the insult of GB. The sulphur containing compounds, ACS 1 and ACS 67 which release hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) slowly and NAC (a pro-cysteine GSH precursor) attenuated GB-induced cell death of RGC- 5 cells. In contrast, <b>sulbutiamine</b> (a lipophilic thiolic thiamine derivative) was particularly effective in protecting RGC- 5 cells from an insult of serum deprivation. Moreover, all of the sulphur compounds directly sequestered different types of ROS but with varying efficiency. Common features by which all tested sulphur containing agents seem to elicit a mode of action include the stimulation of GSH and the antioxidant enzyme glutathione-S-transferase (GST) as well as to scavenge excess free radicals. Moreover, the slow release of H 2 S from the ACS compounds appears to protect cells from oxidative stress through increasing the level of GSH, modulation of the cystine uptake transporter xCT, stimulation of the oxidative stress related transcription factor Nrf 2 and the stimulation of pro-survival signalling pathways. The slow releasing H 2 S sulphur compound ACS 67 also counteracts a number of detrimental influences to the rat retina in situ because of ischemia/reperfusion that includes damage to their ganglion cells. This suggests that such sulphur compounds might find a use in the treatment of glaucoma where ischemia probably plays a part in the disease process.

40|$|Abstract Background Lipid-soluble {{thiamine}} precursors have a {{much higher}} bioavailability than genuine thiamine and therefore {{are more suitable for}} therapeutic purposes. Benfotiamine (S-benzoylthiamine O-monophosphate), an amphiphilic S-acyl thiamine derivative, prevents the progression of diabetic complications, probably by increasing tissue levels of thiamine diphosphate and so enhancing transketolase activity. As the brain is particularly sensitive to thiamine deficiency, we wanted to test whether intracellular thiamine and thiamine phosphate levels are increased in the brain after oral benfotiamine administration. Results Benfotiamine that is practically insoluble in water, organic solvents or oil was solubilized in 200 mM hydroxypropyl-Î²-cyclodextrin and the mice received a single oral administration of 100 mg/kg. Though thiamine levels rapidly increased in blood and liver to reach a maximum after one or two hours, no significant increase was observed in the brain. When mice received a daily oral administration of benfotiamine for 14 days, thiamine derivatives were increased significantly in the liver but not in the brain, compared to control mice. In addition, incubation of cultured neuroblastoma cells with 10 Î¼M benfotiamine did not lead to increased intracellular thiamine levels. Moreover, in thiamine-depleted neuroblastoma cells, intracellular thiamine contents increased more rapidly after addition of thiamine to the culture medium than after addition of benfotiamine for which a lag period was observed. Conclusion Our results show that, though benfotiamine strongly increases thiamine levels in blood and liver, it has no significant effect in the brain. This would explain why beneficial effects of benfotiamine have only been observed in peripheral tissues, while <b>sulbutiamine,</b> a lipid-soluble thiamine disulfide derivative, that increases thiamine derivatives in the brain as well as in cultured cells, acts as a central nervous system drug. We propose that benfotiamine only penetrates the cells after dephosphorylation by intestinal alkaline phosphatases. It then enters the bloodstream as S-benzoylthiamine that is converted to thiamine in erythrocytes and in the liver. Benfotiamine, an S-acyl derivative practically insoluble in organic solvents, should therefore be differentiated from truly lipid-soluble thiamine disulfide derivatives (allithiamine and the synthetic <b>sulbutiamine</b> and fursultiamine) with a different mechanism of absorption and different pharmacological properties. </p...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that thiamine (vitamin B 1) {{and some of its}} derivatives can exert prominent neuroprotective effects in the mammalian brain, particularly in mouse models of Alzheimerâ€™s disease and tauopathies. As orally administered thiamine crosses intestinal and blood-brain barriers only slowly, precursors with higher bioavailability e. g. <b>sulbutiamine,</b> benfotiamine and dibenzoylthiamine, have been developed. We investigated the protective effects of thiamine and those precursors in neuroblastoma cells cultured in a medium containing minimal amounts of thiamine (10 nM), but sufficient to sustain normal growth. We induced oxidative stress by incubating the cells (24 h) {{in the presence of the}} neurotoxic agent paraquat (0. 25 mM). This treatment reduced cell viability by 40 %. When thiamine or the precursors were present simultaneously, we observed protective effects by the precursors while free thiamine was ineffective. Dibenzoylthiamine was most efficient, affording complete protection of cells at 10 - 20 ÂµM. It also caused the highest increase in intracellular thiamine, suggesting that the protection from oxidative damage is linked to increased levels of free thiamine (rather than thiamine disphophate) in the neuroblastoma cells. The mechanism of this protective effect is presently under investigation. These results and others from our laboratory raise the possibility that dibenzoylthiamine might useful as a neuroprotective agent in neurodegenerative disease. Peer reviewe...|$|E
