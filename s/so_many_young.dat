5|$|The loss of <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>young</b> men {{during the}} Second World War made it {{difficult}} for clubs to retain their former status. This was especially true for Millwall, who appeared to suffer more than most. From being one of the country's biggest clubs before the war, Millwall were reduced to one of its smallest afterward. The Den sustained severe bomb damage on 19 April 1943, and one week later a fire, determined to have been caused by a discarded cigarette, also destroyed an entire stand. The club accepted offers from neighbours Charlton Athletic, Crystal Palace and West Ham United to stage games at their grounds. On 24 February 1944, Millwall returned to The Den, to play in an all-standing stadium. This was achieved with considerable volunteer labour by Lions fans. One of the biggest Cup upsets came in the fourth round of the 1956–57 FA Cup on 26 January 1957, when Millwall beat Newcastle United 2–1 in front of a crowd of 45,646. At the time the club was fighting for Third Division survival.|$|E
25|$|Australia's last Test before First World War {{was against}} New Zealand in July 1914. The war {{had a very}} {{negative}} effect on rugby union in Australia. All rugby union competitions in New South Wales and Queensland ceased during the War after the state bodies decided it was inappropriate to play football when <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>young</b> men were fighting overseas. This resulted in competitions all but closed down in New South Wales and Queensland. In Queensland regular competitions did not commence again until 1928. This caused many players to switch to rugby league – which did not cease playing during the war.|$|E
25|$|George Alfred Wills {{originally}} planned to base the residence around Goldney Hall in Clifton, next to Clifton Hill House. However, the Warden of the all-female Clifton Hill House felt that having <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>young</b> men {{so close to}} her residents would pose a significant risk and demanded that the new hall be sited at least two miles away. Thus Downside House in Stoke Bishop was purchased, and a quadrangle of accommodation blocks erected around it according {{to the design of}} Sir George Oatley. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II listed building. A Latin inscription on the exterior of the dining hall dedicated the hall to Henry Herbert.|$|E

500|$|In desperation the Council tried a {{different}} strategy, offering an amnesty to thieves if they paid compensation to their victims. The problem of powerful families protecting criminal relatives {{was to be}} solved by expelling them {{to other parts of}} the realm. This strategy did not last long, and at Thunderfield Æthelstan returned to the hard line, softened by raising the minimum age for the death penalty to fifteen [...] "because he thought it too cruel to kill <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>young</b> people and for such small crimes as he understood to be the case everywhere".

In June 2009, a non-political organization called the Corporación Cultural de Pichilemu (Pichilemu Cultural Corporation) was formed to manage the cultural center, in coordination with the local government. The center's inauguration was supposed to take place in March of that year, with President Michelle Bachelet Jeria in attendance; however, it was postponed until 27 January 2010.

Although Grinstead's parents are not known, he may have learned law as the younger son of an attorney.

The ships were so rickety, old and derelict that we would not go to sea in them today. Yet, these brave, perhaps foolhardy, men crossed the Atlantic, went to the Mediterranean and North African coast and kept Ireland supplied with vital provisions. My father's ship, the Kerlogue, was involved in one of the great rescues of the war.

2500|$|In the 1990s and 2000s, Wicca {{began to}} become {{ingrained}} in popular culture. Aspects of Wicca {{were incorporated into}} the New Age movement, and many Wiccans took on New Age beliefs and practices. Wicca was also taken up by popular entertainment; in 1996, the American film The Craft was released about four witches who are corrupted by their power. The same year the television series Sabrina the Teenage Witch appeared, which was followed the following year by Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and in 1998 by the series Charmed and the film Practical Magic. Whilst these were heavily criticised by many Wiccans (Margot Adler called The Craft [...] "the worst movie ever made!"), they did encourage many teenagers and young adults to investigate more about the religion. Most covens and Neopagan groups refused to allow under 18s into their ranks, and so many teenagers turned to books to find out more. In turn, several books were published to cater for them, including Silver Ravenwolf's Teen Witch: Wicca for a New Generation and Scott Cunningham's Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner. This helped {{to bring about the}} Teen Wicca movement, and {{it has been suggested that}} the reason why <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>young</b> adults are attracted to the faith can [...] "be attributed to the fact that it tackles issues that teenagers are interested in– in a way that other religions do not." ...|$|E
