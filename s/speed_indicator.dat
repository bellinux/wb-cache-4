5|$|On 10 August 1959, a B-52 {{crashed in}} the Spruce Swamp at Fremont, New Hampshire. The bomber {{was on a}} routine {{training}} mission from Chicopee, Massachusetts, when its air <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> and altimeter failed, which led to more serious malfunctions. The B-52 was attempting to make an emergency landing at Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada, the only landing option not affected by foggy weather conditions. However, it crashed before making the landing. The U.S. Air Force reported {{that it was the}} first B-52 crash where the entire crew survived; the crew parachuted to safety. Debris from the crash covered a quarter-mile of densely wooded swampland.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} use of {{floating}} car data (FCD) to monitor free flow speeds on the Belgian road network. Vehicle speeds were obtained from GPS signals emitted at 500 selected locations during the whole year 2013. Over 17 million individual vehicle speeds were analyzed. The results show that, although FCD are not specifically designed {{for this type of}} measurement, they allow obtaining free flow <b>speed</b> <b>indicators</b> with acceptable levels of precision. This is very encouraging because it provides a scope for monitoring free flow speed at a much higher temporal and spatial frequency than is currently possible with traditional road side measurements. The results also illustrate a number of methodological challenges, most notably, controlling for potential sources of bias in sampling the driver population. As subsequent work will enable to overcome these challenges, we conclude that FCD provide a feasible and attractive alternative for obtaining <b>speed</b> <b>indicators...</b>|$|R
50|$|On 6 February 1996 Birgenair Flight 301 {{was bound}} for Frankfurt, Germany but crashed shortly after {{take-off}} from Puerto Plata Airport in the Dominican Republic into Atlantic Ocean 26 kilometres off-shore. All 176 passengers and 13 crew members, among them 154 Germans and 9 Polish people died, presumably instantantly. It {{was found that}} one of the air <b>speed</b> <b>indicators</b> of the Boeing 757-225 was not working properly due to a mud dauber wasp having made a nest in a pitot tube, confusing the pilots about whether the plane's speed was too fast or too slow. The black box, data recorder pointed to error by the captain, because instead of measuring the air speed through one of the working air <b>speed</b> <b>indicators</b> he continued to use the faulty indicator and did not return to the airport. The aircraft was leased due to a problem on the scheduled aircraft for the flight.|$|R
25|$|Table A of the Network Rail Sectional Appendix {{provides}} {{a list of}} these. Where there {{is a change in}} permissible speed on a line, a permissible <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> sign will show the new speed. Train crew are expected to know every permissible speed for all the routes they work over as part of their Route knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{discovered}} that the aircraft {{was the subject of}} a large number of complaints by pilots, called write-ups in the aviation industry. The highest number of complaints concerned the captain's side vertical <b>speed</b> <b>indicator,</b> which informs the air crew of the rate (in ft/min: Feet Per Minute) at which the aircraft is ascending or descending. In all, 48 complaints were made regarding the instrument in the three months before the crash. The aircraft's left right inertial reference system, which informs pilots what direction the aircraft is turning in, was complained about a total of thirty times. The International Herald Tribune reported that this may be of particular significance. The third most-complained about instrument was a fuel differential light, which received fifteen write-ups. Numerous complaints were also received about inoperative cockpit instrument lights, as well as multiple other malfunctions. Several complaints were made that the flaps, which modify drag and lift during take-off and landing, were jamming at twenty-five degrees upon landing, and there were two complaints that the weather radar was faulty.|$|E
500|$|When the air {{has little}} {{moisture}} or when an inversion stops {{the warm air}} from rising high enough for the moisture to condense, thermals do not create cumulus clouds. Without clouds or dust devils to mark the thermals, thermals are not always associated with any feature on the ground. The pilot must then use both skill and luck to find them using a sensitive vertical <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> called a variometer that quickly indicates climbs and descents. Occasionally reliable thermals {{can be found in}} the exhaust gases from power stations or from fires.|$|E

5|$|During the war RAF Uxbridge was {{tasked with}} {{despatching}} personnel {{to and from}} training and operational units in Northern France. It also housed the RAF Uxbridge Language School, where Polish Air Force pilots were taught key RAF codewords. Pilots practised formation flying on the station football pitch, using tricycles fitted with radios, compasses and <b>speed</b> <b>indicators.</b> British Expeditionary Force troops returning from Dunkirk were processed at Uxbridge. In mid-1940, staff at the station processed an average of 2,500 recruits and experienced troops per week.|$|R
500|$|A blocked {{static port}} {{is a more}} serious {{situation}} because it affects all pitot-static instruments. One {{of the most common}} causes of a blocked static port is airframe icing. [...] A blocked static port will cause the altimeter to freeze at a constant value, the altitude at which the static port became blocked. [...] The vertical <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> will become frozen at zero and will not change at all, even if vertical speed increases or decreases. [...] The airspeed indicator will reverse the error that occurs with a clogged pitot tube and cause the airspeed to be read less than it actually is as the aircraft climbs. [...] When the aircraft is descending, the airspeed will be over-reported. [...] In most aircraft with unpressurized cabins, an alternative static source is available and can be selected from within the cockpit.|$|E
500|$|The variometer, {{also known}} as the {{vertical}} <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> (VSI) or the vertical velocity indicator (VVI), is the pitot-static instrument used {{to determine whether or not}} an aircraft is flying in level flight. [...] The vertical speed specifically shows the rate of climb or the rate of descent, which is measured in feet per minute or meters per second. [...] The vertical speed is measured through a mechanical linkage to a diaphragm located within the instrument. [...] The area surrounding the diaphragm is vented to the static port through a calibrated leak (which also may be known as a [...] "restricted diffuser"). [...] When the aircraft begins to increase altitude, the diaphragm will begin to contract at a rate faster than that of the calibrated leak, causing the needle to show a positive vertical speed. [...] The reverse of this situation is true when an aircraft is descending. [...] The calibrated leak varies from model to model, but the average time for the diaphragm to equalize pressure is between 6 and 9 seconds.|$|E

50|$|In Neustadt Hauptbahnhof, {{the maximum}} {{permissible}} speed of 100 km/h (90 km/h in the opposite direction) is raised via 130 km/h to 140 km/h and after a subsequent right curve is restored to 160 km/h. This maximum speed continues to Ludwigshafen-Mundenheim, where the top speed is reduced from 130 km/h to 80 km/h and then 60 km/h. On the Ludwigshafen-Mannheim section, the selected path determines the permissible maximum speed. 20, 30, 40, 60, 70 or 80 km/h might be permitted.

2500|$|The Bristol 138, the record-breaking {{machine is}} a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane designed to fly at extremely high altitudes for the era. Aviation publication Flight observed {{of the aircraft}} that: [...] "except for its size, reminds one very much of the little Bristol Brownie.... the machine is the largest single-seater aeroplane ever built". The pilot was seated in a relatively spacious cockpit, which was heated by air directed from the oil coolers set within the wings, which could be actively controlled. Instrumentation included fore-and-aft levels, oil pressure gauges, airspeed indicator and fuel gauge, engine <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> and pyrometer. Purpose-built recording altimeters, developed by the RAE, were housed within the wings, while a separate altimeter was installed within the cockpit for the pilot.|$|E
40|$|Aim. To study {{clinical}} and morphofunctional indicators of respiratory function {{in patients with}} dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with and without pulmonary hypertension (PH). Material and methods. 91 patients with idiopathic DCM (34 women and 57 men; mean age of 46. 4 ± 13. 7 years) were included into the study. 25  (27. 4 %) patients had right ventricular DCM (RV DCM). 6 -minute walking test (6 MWT), the standard 12 -lead ECG, spirography, echocardiography were performed in all patients. PH occurred in 48 of DCM patients (Group I) and 43 DCM patients had no PH (Group II). A number of patients with RV DCM in Groups I and II was 11 (23 %) and 14 (32. 5 %), respectively. Results. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) in group I was 48. 1 ± 10. 7 mmHg (in 71 % of the patients – degree 1 of PH, and in 29 % - degree 2). A significant decrease {{in the majority of}} <b>speed</b> <b>indicators</b> of respiratory functions was found in Group I. The inverse relationship between PASP and Tiffno index (p= 0. 03) and a positive correlation between forced vital capacity (53. 17 ± 9. 21 %) and 6 MWT distance (206. 7 ± 80. 3 m; p= 0. 017)  were found in patients of Group I. Conclusion. PH syndrome often aggravates the DCM course. Forced expiratory volume in the first second, Tiffno index, and some <b>speed</b> <b>indicators</b> show disorders of respiratory function in DCM patients. </p...|$|R
50|$|The cockpit {{containing}} the flying officers {{were provided with}} numerous controls and features; {{to the left of}} the first pilot were the controls for the auto-pilot and a P.4 compass, who was also provided with a beam approach indicator (to aid nighttime landings) and DF visual loop indicator in addition to the standard flight controls. Switches for the flaps and position indicators were located on a central panel set between the two pilots, while the master fuel cocks were set above these on the roof; throttle and mixture controls were also normally positioned between the pilots.

5000|$|The European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) is an {{initiative}} {{backed by the}} European Union to enhance cross-border interoperability and the procurement of signalling equipment by creating a single Europe-wide standard for train control and command systems.

2500|$|In {{the last}} week of June 1956, a new maximum-minimum {{airspeed}} indicator was installed in a Boeing B-47 Stratojet to undergo operational suitability testing. [...] "The new instrument, resembling the standard type indicator, differs in that it will determine the stall speed of an aircraft at any specific time. It will also compute the approach speed of the aircraft to aid the pilot in attaining proper speeds for landing. In the past, with the standard type indicator, pilots have had to determine the approach speed of the aircraft through a mental process of totaling the weight of the fuel load and the operating weight of the aircraft to arrive at the gross weight. This was then applied to a chart to determine the proper approach speed of the aircraft. This method, using the standard indicator, left room for error. With the high speed aircraft of today, pilots must be accurate in determining the speed in order to prevent stalling or approaching the landing strip too fast. The new maximum-minimum air <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> is designed to prevent errors that might be made by mental calculations of the pilot. The testing of the new indicator is under the supervision of Major Oliver D. Taylor, 3245th Test Group (Bombardment), Air Force Operational Test Center." ...|$|E
