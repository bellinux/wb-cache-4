40|$|Many {{optimization}} algorithms exploit parallelism {{by calling}} multiple independent instances {{of the function}} to be minimized, and these function in turn may call off-the-shelf simulators. The I/O load from the simulators can cause problems for an NFS file system. In this paper we explore efficient parallelization in a parallel program for which each processor makes <b>serial</b> <b>calls</b> to a MODFLOW simulator. Each MODFLOW simulation reads input files and produces output files. The application is &quot;embarassingly &quot; parallel except for disk I/O. Substitution of local scratch as opposed to global file storage ameliorates synchronization and contention issues. An easier solution was to use the high performance global file system GPFS instead of NFS. Compared to using local I/O, using a high performance shared file system such as GPFS requires less user effort...|$|E
