Although, this regulation has been enacted, its implementation is questionable. The aim {{of this research was}} to assess factors affecting the implementation of the NBR and measures to enhance smooth implementation of NBR in Ghana. Interview and questionnaire survey were the two principal methods used to elicit data from 180 respondents. Three (3) key groups of respondents were targeted for the study, namely local authority staff, building practitioners and building owners. The research findings indicated that the most important factors affecting the implementation of the NBR in Ghana are: corruption; bureaucratic procedures; lack of public education about the building regulations; inadequate resources for implementers; and political interference. The respondents suggest that to deal with the factors affecting implementation of the NBR, there is the need to allow easy access to information on NBR and the use of one-stop shops to improve coordination. Also professionals who compromise the NBR should be sanctioned and then the public should be educated and sensitized about the NBR...|$|R

Thus, they refer to activities and abilities that increase profitability, decrease risk, and support the company´s growth. The aim of this contribution is to identify value generators in a building enterprise.

40|$|Effective {{method of}} {{strengthening}} of foundations <b>of</b> existing <b>buildings</b> by pre-stressed shells is {{considered in the}} paper. Advantages of the proposed strengthening method, its production technology and pre-conditions of its analysis are also presented. Presently, strengthening of ground foundations and foundations <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> and structures is a relevant civil engineering challenge. It is driven by high intensity of restructuring and modernization <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> and <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> geological engineering conditions of the areas that are being built up. One of effective methods of strengthening of foundations <b>of</b> existing <b>buildings</b> represents arrangement <b>of</b> pre-stressed concrete shells with conventional steel or metal-free reinforcement. If compared with injection-based technologies, the proposed reinforcement method reduces the cost of construction work by 1. 5 times, on average.

The palace still features a number of unusually well-preserved elements from this time. The main facade, {{as well as the}} basement and ground floor, still essentially retain the 12th century appearance <b>of</b> the <b>building.</b> <b>Alterations</b> were made in the 14th century and on a larger scale during the 15th century, when it belonged to the Bellomo family from which it derives its name. From this period, a number of details such as portals, mullioned windows and the staircase display influences from Catalan Gothic, a style which was popular on Sicily at the time (as Sicily was at the time part of the Crown of Aragon). In the 18th century the palace and the neighbouring Parisio Palace were taken over by a Benedectine monastery who merged the buildings into one. In 1866 the palace was expropriated by the Italian state and serves as a museum since 1940. A renovation was carried out in 2004-2009.|$|R
50|$|Building code {{requirements}} generally {{apply to}} the construction <b>of</b> new <b>buildings</b> and <b>alterations</b> or additions to existing buildings, changes in the use <b>of</b> <b>buildings,</b> and the demolition <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> or portions <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> {{at the ends of}} their useful or economic lives. As such, building codes obtain their effect from the voluntary decisions of property owners to erect, alter, add to, or demolish a building in a jurisdiction where a building code applies, because these circumstances routinely require a permit. The plans are subject to review for compliance with current building codes as part of the permit application process. Generally, building codes are not otherwise retroactive except to correct an imminent hazard. However, accessibility standards - similar to those referenced in the model building codes - may be retroactive subject to the applicability of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) which is a federal civil rights requirement.|$|R

40|$|Building {{refurbishment}} is {{an important}} sector in the Malaysian construction industry. The increase the number <b>of</b> <b>building</b> renovations, <b>alterations,</b> extensions and extensive repair works contributed to the high demand for refurbishment projects. However, refurbishment projects {{are more difficult to}} manage compared to new-built, due to uncertainty factors inherent in the projects. Therefore, this paper identifies factors that contributed to uncertainty and shows how it affects design performance of refurbishment projects. This paper was also extended to the used of coordination devices to improve design performance from the effect of uncertainty in the projects. Partial-correlation technique was used in data analysis to check any significant moderate effects of coordination devices to control the negative effect of uncertainty on design performance of refurbishment projects. Four (4) coordination devices involved in the partial-correlation tests. The results concluded that the use of lateral relations and architect’s characteristics are most likely reducing the uncertainty of client attributes towards design completeness before work started on site...|$|R
50|$|In 1803 {{the house}} reverted to single {{occupancy}} {{for a short}} period during which the tenancy was held by Sir John Slade from 1808-1852, although he ceased living there from 1829. Slade made a number <b>of</b> <b>building</b> <b>alterations</b> including removing windows and adding buttresses to the east front, using the Abbot’s Room as the main entrance and adding a reeded white marble chimney piece to the fireplace.In 1837 the house was sub-divided again and occupied by a Mr Henry Brodribb, a solicitor and Miss Margaret Bazley (or Bazeley) headmistress of the Godolphin School which was then situated at “Arundells” in the Cathedral Close. In 1837 the Godolphin School moved into the King’s House and was transferred in 1848 when an outbreak of cholera in the city forced its evacuation to premises on Milford Hill in another part of Salisbury.In 1849 further renovations included constructing a linking passage along the west façade which effectively hid the original 15th century exterior. In 1850 Thomas Henry Wyatt removed the buttresses from the east face and restored the windows in Elizabethan form.From its vacancy by the Godolphin School the King’s House was used to accommodate the Diocesan Training College for Schoolmistresses,(ref Inspired to Teach) In 1873 an extension to the building was constructed to the design of Edward Doran Webb to provide dormitories and in 1899 a further extension for a chapel, with the installation of electricity and heating. In the window of the former chapel there is a stained glass representation by Kempe of the gartered arms of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales who had visited the house with his father in 1610 but had died before his father’s second visit in 1613. This room is now used to display ceramics.It was here at The Diocesan Training College that Thomas Hardy’s sisters, Kate and Mary, were trained perhaps inspiring the attendance and escape from the college of Sue Bridehead in Melchester (Salisbury) in Jude the Obscure wherein the college is described.|$|R

Çakaloğlu Khan is located in the historic Kemeraltı commercial district, to the southwest of Kızlarağası Khan close to İzmir harbor. The building distinguishes itself from other urban Ottoman Khans by its location, its middle passage plan type, its mass made up of spaces of various heights and original architectural elements. The model utilized two-dimensional documentation drawings <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> consisting <b>of</b> plan, elevation, sections and digital photos. Primarily, the photos were edited using the softwares Zoner Photo Studio 10, Adobe Photoshop Elements 7. 0 and Inkscape, following which a solid model of the Khan was built and the photos were attached to the model surface. This model was then transferred to Google Earth, and its location on the earth was determined by entering its x, y and z coordinates. This study enabled access and sharing of the three-dimensional image <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> through satellite. The exterior mass and original architectural elements <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> were documented by using low cost digital technology in threedimensions based on images. The prepared model not only enabled to holistically perceive a building hitherto hidden among densly located buildings, but also created data to discuss numerous alternatives for its conservation decisions...|$|R

40|$|Establishing virtual city models (“digital cities”) {{has become}} an {{important}} planning tool for configuring {{the future of our}} cities and vital spaces. The present contribution discusses the concept of “Space-related Content-Management” and its interlaceable possibilities of implementation in the planning and configuration process. The activities of those acting in space and their impacts on space, e. g. leading to new, additional and renovation <b>of</b> <b>buildings,</b> to the demolition <b>of</b> <b>buildings,</b> to <b>alterations</b> regarding vegetation stock, traffic infrastructure, etc., do not result from a static conception of physical space, but exclusively suggest a dynamic one. Real space is subject to continuous changes. The constant changing of physical space thus represents a considerable factor concerning the conception of the virtual image (virtual city model). The dynamics of space suggests the development of “data-pipelines” as core elements of virtual city models. Only this pipeline-concept can account for the dynamics of space. It is suggested to embed “datapipelines” in “Content-Management-Systems (CMS) ” thus promoting the concept of “Space-related Content-Management” including all kinds of space-related information enriched with metainformation that might be useful during the planning- and configuration process. “Space-related Content-Management-Systems (SCMS) ” are considered as navigation systems through complex space-related data sets supporting a broad range of questions during the planning- and configuration process. The application fields of “Space-related Content Management-Systems” are supposed to integrate the complete planning process starting with the space-related analysis and model generation via characterization of space and winds up at the development of space-related concepts to be passed on to those involved in the space under consideration...|$|R
