25|$|At nightfall, Colonel <b>Savin</b> {{decided to}} {{evacuate}} the wounded via the only working armored personnel carrier available. After loading 40 wounded soldiers on board, the APC moved {{in the wrong direction}} (toward the center of the city). It turned around and was ambushed by Chechen anti-tank gunners; only 13 soldiers survived to be taken prisoner. On January 2, Colonel <b>Savin</b> and his remaining officers abandoned the railway station. They found some abandoned armored personnel carriers and attempted to escape the area, but were attacked by Chechen fighters and <b>Savin</b> died on the street from shrapnel wounds beside his wrecked vehicle. By January 3, the 131st Brigade had lost nearly 789 men killed (further 75 were captured, and only 160 reached safety), including almost all of its officers. In addition, 20 of 26 tanks and 102 of 120 other armored vehicles were lost as well. The entire Maikop Brigade of over 1000 men had been wiped out in sixty hours.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 the Russian {{historian}} V. Totfalushin found {{a document}} in the Russian State Historical Archives which casts doubts on Savin’s claimed age and provides some interesting details about him. The document is {{an excerpt from}} the official memo by the Russian Minister of Internal Affairs on the status of the surviving veterans of the Grande Armée still residing in Russia. According to this document, dated 1834, the French authorities had contacted the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs with a note that Nicolas <b>Savin</b> had requested permission to leave Russia and return home. The memo specifies that, according to the French authorities, <b>Savin</b> was born in Rouen, in Normandy, and had served as a non-commissioned officer in the 24th Chasseurs à Cheval before being captured in 1812 and sent to Saratov, where he had gained Russian citizenship (poddanstvo) in 1813. The memo further notes that in 1816 <b>Savin</b> had married the daughter of a local merchant and had had two sons, Pavel (born in 1821) and Alexander (born in 1828), and two daughters, Avdotia (born in 1823) and Akulina (born in 1825). Totfalushin’s research also questions Savin’s final age, noting that in another document, which <b>Savin</b> submitted to the local authorities in Khvalynsk in 1839, he indicated that he was 52 years old, which means he was born about 1787.|$|E

In his testimony, <b>Savins</b> identified an Estonian businessman, diplomat and a former chief of the Estonian intelligence service Eerik-Niiles Kross — son of Jaan Kross — as a mastermind of the operation.

25|$|A {{variety of}} juniper, known as <b>savin,</b> was {{mentioned}} frequently in European writings. In one case in England, a rector from Essex {{was said to}} have procured it for a woman he had impregnated in 1574; in another, a man wishing to remove his girlfriend of like condition recommended to her that black hellebore and <b>savin</b> be boiled together and drunk in milk, or else that chopped madder be boiled in beer. Other substances reputed to have been used by the English include Spanish fly, opium, watercress seed, iron sulphate, and iron chloride. Another mixture, not abortifacient, but rather intended to relieve missed abortion, contained dittany, hyssop, and hot water.|$|E
25|$|A Russian {{document}} {{dating from}} 1839 suggests that {{by his own}} account <b>Savin</b> was born about 1787. This would contradict his earliest claims about his military service and would make his age at death about 107, instead of 126.|$|E

25|$|The {{sections}} of Dorchester have distinct ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic compositions. The eastern areas of Dorchester (especially between Adams Street and Dorchester Bay) are primarily ethnic European and Asian, {{with a large}} population of Irish Americans and Vietnamese Americans, while {{the residents of the}} western, central and parts of the southern {{sections of}} the neighborhood are predominantly African Americans. In Neponset, the southeast corner of the neighborhood, as well as parts of <b>Savin</b> Hill in the north and Cedar Grove in the south, Irish Americans maintain the most visible identity. In the northern section of Dorchester and southwestern section of South Boston is the Polish Triangle, where recent Polish immigrants are residents. <b>Savin</b> Hill, as well as Fields Corner, have large Vietnamese American populations. Uphams Corner contains a Cape Verdean American community, the largest concentration of people of Cape Verdean origin within Boston city limits. Western, central and parts of southern Dorchester have a large Caribbean population (especially people from Haiti, Jamaica, Barbados, and Trinidad and Tobago). They are most heavily represented in the Codman Square, Franklin Field and the Ashmont area, although there are also significant numbers in Four Corners and Fields Corner. Significant numbers of African Americans live in the Harbor Point, Uphams Corner, Fields Corner, Four Corners and Franklin Field areas. In recent years Dorchester has also seen an influx of young residents, gay men and women, and working artists (in areas like Lower Mills, Ashmont Hill/Peabody Square, and <b>Savin</b> Hill).|$|E

Some of them accompanied him within 8 miles of the top, but durst go no further, telling him that no Indian ever dared to go higher, and that he would die if he went. So they staid there till his return, and his two Indians took courage by his example and went with him. They went divers times through the thick clouds for a good space, and within 4 miles of the top, they had no clouds but very cold. By the way among the rocks, there were two ponds, one a blackish water, and the other reddish Lakes of the Clouds. The top of all was plain about 60 feet square. On the north side was such a precipice Great Gulf, as they could scarcely discern to the bottom. They had neither cloud nor wind on the top, and moderate heat. All the country about him seemed a level, except here and there a hill rising above the rest, and far beneath them.

25|$|Dorchester, with a {{population}} of approximately 130,000, is home to nearly one quarter of all Boston residents.

60|$|He disliked clubs; I don't {{know whether}} he belonged to any in New York, but I never met him in one. As I have told, he himself had formed the Human Race Club, but as he never could get it {{together}} it hardly counted. There {{was to have been}} a meeting of it the time of my only visit to Stormfield in April of last year; but of three who were to have come I alone came. We got on very well without the absentees, after finding them in the wrong, as usual, and the visit was like those I used to have with him so many years before in Hartford, but there was not the old ferment of subjects. Many things had been discussed and put away for good, but we had our old fondness for nature and for each other, who were so differently parts of it. He showed his absolute content with his house, and that was the greater pleasure for me because it was my son who designed it. The architect had been so fortunate as to be able to plan it where a natural avenue of <b>savins,</b> the closeknit, slender, cypress-like cedars of New England, led away {{from the rear of the}} villa to the little level of a pergola, meant some day to be wreathed and roofed with vines. But in the early spring days all the landscape was in the beautiful nakedness of the northern winter. It opened in the surpassing loveliness of wooded and meadowed uplands, under skies that were the first days blue, and the last gray over a rainy and then a snowy floor. We walked up and down, up and down, between the villa terrace and the pergola, and talked with the melancholy amusement, the sad tolerance of age for the sort of men and things that used to excite us or enrage us; now we were far past turbulence or anger. Once we took a walk together across the yellow pastures to a chasmal creek on his grounds, where the ice still knit the clayey banks together like crystal mosses; and the stream far down clashed through and over the stones and the shards of ice. Clemens pointed out the scenery he had bought to give himself elbow-room, and showed me the lot he was going to have me build on. The next day we came again with the geologist he had asked up to Stormfield to analyze its rocks. Truly he loved the place, though he had been so weary of change and so indifferent to it that he never saw it till he came to live in it. He left it all to the architect whom he had known from a child in the intimacy which bound our families together, though we bodily lived far enough apart. I loved his little ones and he was sweet to mine and was their delighted-in and wondered-at friend. Once and once again, and yet again and again, the black shadow that shall never be lifted where it falls, fell in his house and in mine, during the forty years and more that we were friends, and endeared us the more to each other.|$|R
25|$|According to {{literary}} historian Mircea Martin, Georgescu {{was one of}} the intellectuals who, after the liberalization episode, were involved in the large debates over the interpretation of history and the nature of Romanian culture. In this interpretation, he stood among those who protected the ideals of Europeanism and cosmopolitanism, in the company of other communists dissatisfied with the official line (Crohmălniceanu, <b>Savin</b> Bratu, Vera Călin, Paul Cornea, Silvian Iosifescu), of former political prisoners of communism (Nicolae Balotă, Ovidiu Cotruş, Ştefan Augustin Doinaş, Adrian Marino, Ion Negoiţescu, Alexandru Paleologu), and of many younger figures who were just making their debut on the literary scene. This community, Martin notes, resisted the ethnic nationalism and Protochronism promoted with acquiescence from the regime, by such figures as Paul Anghel, Eugen Barbu, Edgar Papu, Mihai Ungheanu and Dan Zamfirescu. Paul Georgescu's contemporaries describe his enduring passion for ideological conflict. He believed Romanian literature itself to have been shaped by the conflict between two stances, both exemplified by 19th century authors: on one hand, the pessimistic and emphatic Mihai Eminescu; on the other, the sarcastic and often absurdist Ion Luca Caragiale.|$|E
