500|$|The PlayStation {{version of}} Dark Forces {{received}} less positive reviews. It holds an aggregate score on GameRankings of 59.57%. GameSpot wrote [...] "Though {{the speed of}} the Playstation allows for <b>smooth</b> <b>movement,</b> Dark Forces boasts a horrendously choppy frame rate." [...] IGN made a similar point; [...] "Unlike the PC and Mac versions, PlayStation Dark Forces is grainier than a loaf of bread. Close up, everything is blocky and pixelated, but even from far away the walls and textures look like big, chunky blocks. Even worse than the graphics, though, is the frame rate. Or lack thereof. The choppy motion takes so much away from the enjoyment of actually playing the game." [...] Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games offers the same view, saying that the game is [...] "visually dated." ...|$|E
500|$|Computer and Video Games {{reviewer}} {{gave the}} game {{a score of}} 7 out of 10 {{in each of the}} magazine's scoring criteria — graphics, sound, value and playability.

[...] The reviewer also stated [...] "...the <b>smooth</b> <b>movement</b> of objects and characters makes this game a pleasure to watch and play." [...] The game was reviewed again in Amtix! by Massimo Valducci, several months later when Obsidian was re-released on the budget label Americana. Valducci stated it had been one of his favourite titles when it was originally released, giving the game a rating of 70% and stating [...] "Everyone should have this game in their software collection." [...] He praised the game for adding a twist to the maze theme by disallowing the player from fighting back against threats. He added [...] "...a lot of thought and planning is needed to make your way around the various sections, deactivating the security systems as you go." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{mentioning}} the game's art style, most reviewers gave positive response. Denton described the style as a [...] "beautifully drawn, angular 2D world". Prell wrote that Rætikon triangle-based art style made its characters feel like papercraft {{and gave the}} game [...] "a sense of reverence and spirituality" [...] when complemented by the story, and gave comparison to Shadow of the Colossus. [...] Thew gave similar response noting that it is reminiscent of Origami. However, Thew continued to state that while the visuals were [...] "distinctive", the game's [...] "alpine" [...] area was [...] "clichéd and predictable" [...] and its [...] "good looks and <b>smooth</b> <b>movement</b> mechanics" [...] did not compensate {{for the rest of}} the game's design. He found the game [...] "shallow", uninteresting, and [...] "a disappointment ... on almost every level". Denton of Eurogamer praised the moments where he figured out how to find a shard or alphabet piece, but ultimately found Rætikon [...] "awkward", with [...] "substance did not live up to its style", and causing unjustified and unreasonable frustration.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{individual}} timing variability is correlated across similarly controlled tasks. More specifically, discretely produced tasks exhibit individual difference correlations (Zelaznik 2 ̆ 6 Rosenbaum, 2010). Similarly, tasks that are either discretely or smoothly produced show different timing behavior (Huys et al. 2010). The purpose of the current study was to understand if young and old individuals showed different timing behavior for discrete and smooth gross and fine motor tasks. In order to understand whether a specific type of movement had an effect on the type of timing, the timing variance of four different motor tasks was decomposed into clock and motor variance. Subjects in two groups: young and old, performed four types of movements (gross: walking and cycling, fine: tapping (unimanual and bimanual) and circle drawing) to a metronome for 10 seconds and then without a metronome for 20 seconds. Each block consisted of 10 trials with a total of 50 trials. Clock variance was higher for <b>smooth</b> <b>movements</b> (cycling and circle drawing) for the young group compared to the old. However, clock variance for the discrete movements (walking and tapping) was less variable in the young group compared to the old. The young group had less motor variance for <b>smooth</b> <b>movements</b> (cycling and circle drawing) compared to the old. However, the motor variance was greater in the discrete tasks (walking and tapping). Additionally, the variance was higher in the older group compared to the young. These results show opposite behavior of the clock and motor variances based on the type of task and age. Our findings show that, with age, motor variance for discrete movement increases. However, this effect is not seen for the temporal control of <b>smooth</b> <b>movements</b> from which we conclude that older individuals do not exhibit deficits in controlling <b>smooth</b> <b>movements...</b>|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{eyes never}} cease to move: {{ballistic}} saccades quickly turn the gaze toward peripheral targets, whereas smooth pursuit maintains moving targets on the fovea where visual acuity is best. Despite the oculomotor system being endowed with exquisite motor abilities, {{any attempt to}} generate <b>smooth</b> eye <b>movements</b> against a static background results in saccadic eye movements [1, 2]. Although exceptions to this rule have been reported [3 – 5], volitional control over <b>smooth</b> eye <b>movements</b> is at best rudimentary. Here, I introduce a novel, temporally modulated visual display, which, although static, sustains <b>smooth</b> eye <b>movements</b> in arbitrary directions. After brief training, participants gain volitional control over <b>smooth</b> pursuit eye <b>movements</b> and can generate digits, letters, words, or drawings at will. For persons deprived of limb movement, this offers a fast, creative, and personal means of linguistic and emotional expression...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of researchers record binocular eye-tracking signals from participants viewing moving stimuli, {{but the majority of}} event-detection algorithms are monocular and do not consider <b>smooth</b> pursuit <b>movements.</b> The purposes of the present study are to develop an algorithm that discriminates between fixations and <b>smooth</b> pursuit <b>movements</b> in binocular eye-tracking signals and to evaluate its performance using an automated video-based strategy. The proposed algorithm uses a clustering approach that takes both spatial and temporal aspects of the binocular eyetracking signal into account, and is evaluated using a novel video-based evaluation strategy based on automatically detected moving objects in the video stimuli. The binocular algorithm detects 98 % of fixations in image stimuli compared to 95 % when only one eye is used, while for video stimuli, both the binocular and monocular algorithms detect around 40 % of <b>smooth</b> pursuit <b>movements.</b> The present article shows that using binocular information for discrimination of fixations and <b>smooth</b> pursuit <b>movements</b> is advantageous in static stimuli, without impairing the algorithm's ability to detect <b>smooth</b> pursuit <b>movements</b> in video and movingdot stimuli. With an automated evaluation strategy, time-consuming manual annotations are avoided and a larger amount of data can be used in the evaluation process...|$|R

40|$|<b>Smooth</b> pursuit eye <b>movements</b> are {{important}} for vision because they maintain the line of sight on targets that move smoothly within the visual field. Smooth pursuit is driven by neural representations of motion, including a surprisingly strong influence of high-level signals representing expected motion. We studied anticipatory <b>smooth</b> eye <b>movements</b> (defined as <b>smooth</b> eye <b>movements</b> {{in the direction of}} expected future motion) produced by salient visual cues in a group of high-functioning observers with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a condition that has been associated with difficulties in either generating predictions, or translating predictions into effective motor commands. Eye movements were recorded while participants pursued the motion of a disc that moved within an outline drawing of an inverted Y-shaped tube. The cue to the motion path was a visual barrier that blocked the untraveled branch (right or left) of the tube. ASD participants showed strong anticipatory <b>smooth</b> eye <b>movements</b> whose velocity was {{the same as that of}} a group of neurotypical participants. Anticipatory <b>smooth</b> eye <b>movements</b> appeared on the very first cued trial, indicating that trial-by-trial learning was not responsible for the responses. These results are significant because they show that anticipatory capacities are intact in high-functioning ASD in cases where the cue to the motion path is highly salient and unambiguous. Once the ability to generate anticipatory pursuit is demonstrated, the study of the anticipatory responses with a variety of types of cues provides a window into the perceptual or cognitive processes that underlie the interpretation of events in natural environments or social situations...|$|R
