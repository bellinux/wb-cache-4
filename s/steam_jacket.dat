With financial support from his business partner Englishman Matthew Boulton, he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his steam engine, which incorporated a series of radical improvements, notably the closing off of {{the upper part of}} the cylinder, thereby making the low-pressure steam drive the top of the piston instead of the atmosphere, use of a <b>steam</b> <b>jacket</b> and the celebrated separate steam condenser chamber. [...] The separate condenser did away with the cooling water that had been injected directly into the cylinder, which cooled the cylinder and wasted steam. [...] Likewise, the <b>steam</b> <b>jacket</b> kept steam from condensing in the cylinder, also improving efficiency. [...] These improvements increased engine efficiency so that Boulton & Watts engines used only 20–25% as much coal per horsepower-hour as Newcomen's. Boulton and Watt opened the Soho Foundry for the manufacture of such engines in 1795.|$|E

50|$|This type of {{evaporator}} {{is generally}} made of 4 - 8 m) tubes enclosed by <b>steam</b> <b>jackets.</b> The uniform {{distribution of the}} solution is important when using this type of evaporator. The solution enters and gains velocity as it flows downward. This gain in velocity is attributed to the vapor being evolved against the heating medium, which flows downward as well. This evaporator is usually applied to highly viscous solutions, so it is frequently used in the chemical,sugar, food, and fermentation industries.|$|R

The apparatus consists of a metal cylinder closed at both ends (called a <b>steam</b> <b>jacket).</b> It is provided with an inlet and outlet for the steam. The steam for heating the rod is supplied by a boiler which is connected by a rubber tube to the inlet. The center of the cylinder contains a hole to insert a thermometer.

50|$|Copper is the {{traditional}} material for the boiling vessel, because copper transfers heat quickly and evenly, and because the bubbles produced during boiling, and which would act as an insulator against the heat, do not cling {{to the surface of}} copper, so the wort is heated in a consistent manner. The simplest boil kettles are direct-fired, with a burner underneath. These can produce a vigorous and favourable boil, but are also apt to scorch the wort where the flame touches the kettle, causing caramelisation and making cleanup difficult. Most breweries use a steam-fired kettle, which uses <b>steam</b> <b>jackets</b> in the kettle to boil the wort. Breweries usually have a boiling unit either inside or outside of the kettle, usually a tall, thin cylinder with vertical tubes, called a calandria, through which wort is pumped.|$|R
50|$|This {{study of}} the {{compound}} engine made it natural that Admiral Loring should be selected as {{the representative of the}} Navy Department when, in 1874, he and the late Dr. Charles E. Emery made an elaborate series of trials of the engines of the revenue cutters Rush, Dexter, Dallas and Gallatin, to determine by actual test the relative economies of compound and simple engines, designed for the same work in similar hulls, and also to secure reliable and authoritative data with respect to the economy of <b>steam</b> <b>jacketing.</b> These tests were the first of the kind conducted under circumstances of entire reliability, with the result that the report of the trials was republished {{all over the world and}} is still quoted in all the text books on steam engineering.|$|R

She was constructed of fir and [...] "fastened with copper, galvanized iron, and locust tree nails". [...] Her appearance was typical of revenue cutters of the period, flush-decked (or nearly so) with clipper bow, fantail stern, two sail-bearing masts, pilot house and funnel amidships and a deckhouse (probably including the upper parts of the engine and boiler rooms) beneath and extending behind the pilot house. The boiler powering the propulsion machinery was of the Scotch marine boiler type {{and was the first}} instance of that type of boiler on a Revenue Cutter Service vessel. The addition of <b>steam</b> <b>jackets</b> on the cylinders to reduce condensation losses was another innovation new to the service. [...] Her cost and displacement were somewhat greater than the Dexter-class (1874) cutters of similar length and overall design.|$|R

50|$|Traction {{engines in}} Britain were rarely {{fitted with a}} steam dome.

This jacket was large and tall enough to act as a steam dome. The base of the cylinder casting was a curved saddle to fit directly onto the boiler. Holes drilled in the boiler allowed steam to pass through, usually more than one smaller hole, to avoid reducing the boiler strength.|$|E

A <b>steam</b> <b>jacket</b> has been installed which creates drier sand and keeps the pumps, plumbing and the extraction chamber warmer during standby time, minimizing warm-up time.

5000|$|The firm {{exhibited}} their Patent Agricultural Locomotive Engine for Threshing, Ploughing and General Traction Purposes at Battersea in 1862. Aveling {{moved the}} cylinder forward from over the firebox {{to the front}} of the boiler. The <b>steam</b> <b>jacket</b> that surrounds the cylinders did away with the need for a separate dome (the patent stated that the cylinders were placed within the dome). [...] The jacket reduced condensation, and hence priming, in the cylinders, valve gear and now non-existent supply piping. Ports between the jacket and boiler communicated live steam. The crankshaft was now close to the wheels and the long chain could be first shortened, then disposed of in favour of gears. In 1863 Aveling patented two-speed gearing. [...] Exports at this period were to Prussia and Australia.|$|E
50|$|In batch distillation, {{the feed}} is charged to the still pot to which heat is {{supplied}} continuously through a <b>steam</b> <b>jacket</b> or a steam coil. As the mixture boils, it generates a vapour richer {{in the more}} volatile. But as boiling continue, concentration of more volatile in the liquid decrease. It is generally assumed that equilibrium vaporization occurs in the still. The vapour is led to a condenser and the condensate or the top product is collected in the receiver. At the beginning, the condensate will be pretty rich in the more volatiles, but the concentrations of the more volatiles in it decrease as the condensate keep on accumulating in the receiver. The condensate is usually withdrawn intermittently having products or cuts of different concentrations. Batch distillation is used when the feed rate is not large enough to justify installation of a continuous distillation unit. It may also be used when the constituents greatly differ in volatility. Figure 1 show the batch distillation setup.|$|E
40|$|The Iowa Methodist Medical Center of Des Moines, Iowa, is {{installing}} two 1, 500 kW Fairbanks-Morse turbocharged dual-fuel reciprocating engine-generators. The {{system will}} be installed with recovery of exhaust waste heat as <b>steam</b> and <b>jacket,</b> lube oil, and intercooler waste heat as hot water. During periods of high steam demand, the waste heat boilers will be supplementally fired for additional steam production. The paper will present the feasibility study, predesign report, and detailed design results. Both gas turbines and reciprocating engines in numerous configurations were considered. Sensitivity to breakdown, capital costs, and varying escalation rates were investigated. The conclusion was that reciprocating engines would meet the payback requirements with an acceptable level of risk. To further reduce the risk, a bid package for the engines was prepared during predesign. Upon selection of the engines, {{a major portion of}} the project cost was firmly established and final design was authorized. Scheduled completion is February, 1987...|$|R
25|$|Watt's next {{improvement}} to the Newcomen {{design was}} {{to seal the}} top of the cylinder and surround the cylinder with a <b>jacket.</b> <b>Steam</b> was passed through the jacket before being admitted below the piston, keeping the piston and cylinder warm to prevent condensation within it. The second improvement was the utilisation of steam expansion against the vacuum {{on the other side of}} the piston. The steam supply was cut during the stroke, and the steam expanded against the vacuum on the other side. This increased the efficiency of the engine, but also created a variable torque on the shaft which was undesirable for many applications, in particular pumping. Watt therefore limited the expansion to a ratio of 1:2 (i.e. the steam supply was cut at half stroke). This increased the theoretical efficiency from 6.4% to 10.6%, with only a small variation in piston pressure. Watt did not use high pressure steam because of safety concerns.|$|R
40|$|It {{is planned}} that NO{sub x} control {{subsystem}} testing {{in support of}} Phase II of the Low-Emissions Boiler Systems (LEBS) Project occur in ABB Power Plant Laboratories` (PPL) pilot scale Boiler Simulation Facility (BSF). This work will be performed to provide necessary design and operational information for inclusion of an optimized NO, control subsystem in the Proof-of-Concept Test Facility (POCTF) and Commercial Generating Unit (CGU) designs. The BSF is a 50 to 90 x 10 {sup 6 } BTU/hr (15 to 26 MWt) coal, oil or natural gas fired tangential furnace designed to replicate the residence time/temperature history of a utility scale tangentially fired boiler. All major aspects of a typical utility boiler are duplicated in the BSF including the lower furnace, the ash hopper, multiple burner elevations, the arch section, superheater/reheater panels, and the convective heat transfer surfaces. The furnace walls and heat transfer surfaces are cooled by a surrounding water <b>jacket.</b> <b>Steam</b> generated is vented off at atmospheric pressure so that a constant sink temperature of 100 {degrees}C (212 {degrees}C) is maintained. The lower furnace water walls are selectively refractory lined to maintain an appropriate furnace gas temperature history. Refractory is required because the sink temperature (100 {degrees}C) is cooler {{than that of a}} typical, utility boiler, and the surface-to-volume ratio of the BSF is greater than that of a utility boiler due to scale effects. For the subject testing, the BSF will be configured as a coal fired boiler. Design and planning activities associated with the construction of the NO{sub x} control subsystem test unit will continue through June, 1995. Additionally, the schedule for specification of certain low NO{sub x} firing system components was set to allow for precursor, internal and LEBS development activities to occur and subsequently provide necessary design parameters...|$|R
5000|$|The pot {{still is}} {{generally}} {{referred to as}} the Bennett still. The still itself is quite small, which in general will allow most of the flavour characteristics of the botanicals to pass into the spirit. The still is charged with neutral spirit and the botanical recipe added to the liquid, along with some water. This is left to steep for 24 hours, which begins the process of extracting the flavour from the botanicals. The still is then heated by means of an external <b>steam</b> <b>jacket</b> to boil the liquid. As the pot begins to boil, vapour moves up the short column of the still and eventually meets the condenser, where vapours are turned back to liquid and collected. First runnings can be as high as 92% alcohol, with a gradual decrease in the strength as the distillation progresses. Once all of the alcohol is collected, the final spirit will be approximately 75% alcohol v/v. This spirit is of a heavy, oily character with a strong juniper-flavour.|$|E

An experimental study was carried out to better understand and optimize the process of sand consolidation using high-pH steam in wells of the Wilmington field, California. The apparatus consisted of a vertical 18 in. long aluminum cylindrical cell with an ID of 1. 5 in. into which loose sand of the Wilmington Tar Zone was tamped. The top half of the cell was thermally insulated while the bottom half was cooled by means of a cooling <b>jacket.</b> <b>Steam</b> was injected {{at the top of the}} cell and fluids produced at the bottom of the cell. Steam at 250 - 260 degrees C and 700 - 800 psig was injected at rates of 5 cc/min and 20 cc/min. Steam with pH of 7 and 12 were used, the latter obtained by addition of sodium carbonate. Temperatures along the cell axis, and inlet and outlet pressures were measured. The cell contents were removed after each experiment and analyzed to determine if sand consolidation occurred. Thin sections of samples before and after the steam treatment were analyzed using an electron microphone to determine any change in texture and composition of the sand. Xray diffraction analysis was performed to determine the crystallographic characteristics of the "cement'' binding the sand grains where consolidation had occurred. Results showed sand consolidation did not occur for steam with pH of 7. However, for steam of pH 12, the sand was consolidated particularly at the top part of the cell in only hours instead of weeks as reported in the Wilmington field. Analysis showed both needle-like and equant crystals of sodium-aluminum-carbonate-silicates being formed between the consolidated sand grains. Contrary to the previous postulate that precipitation of dissolved quartz or feldspar "cement'' the sand grains, the results indicate that the mechanism of sand consolidation is probably more complex. Further research is planned to fully understand and optimize the technology...|$|R
40|$|In high-containment {{facilities}} {{the treatment}} of biological waste is very important. Liquid waste from containment level 4 laboratories and containment level 3 laboratories which handle nonindigenous animal pathogens is collected and treated in effluent treatment vessels. These vessels decontaminate the effluent using indirect steam via a <b>steam</b> <b>jacket</b> to heat the liquid to a minimum of 121 °C. In some containment facilities the effluent is decontaminated by using direct steam injection to heat the load to the decontamination set point. This method of injecting steam directly into the load {{has the potential of}} providing agitation and reducing the amount of time necessary to heat the load to the set point, thereby reducing the processing time and increasing system capacity. To investigate the benefits of direct steam injection, one of the effluent treatment vessels was modified so that direct steam could be used to supplement the indirect heating of the effluent. After functional testing was conducted to ensure the proper operation of the steam injection, tests were conducted to determine the efficacy of decontamination. For these tests the liquid load was spiked with bacterial spores and samples were taken during the warm-up process as well as during the decontamination period to determine when inactivation of the spores was achieved. To date, very little data have been published on the efficacy of effluent treatment vessels or comparing different methods of heating in these vessels...|$|E
40|$|Wall-to-bed momentum, {{heat and}} mass {{transfer}} in vertical liquid-solids flow, {{as well as}} in single phase flow, were studied. The aim of this investigation was to establish the analogy among those phenomena. Also, effect of particles concentration on momentum, heat and mass transfer was studied. The experiments in hydraulic transport were performed in a 25. 4 mm I. D. cooper tube equipped with a <b>steam</b> <b>jacket,</b> using spherical glass particles of 1. 94 mm in diameter and water as a transport fluid. The segment of the transport tube used for mass transfer measurements was inside coated with benzoic acid. In the hydraulic transport two characteristic flow regimes were observed: turbulent and parallel particle flow regime. The transition between two characteristic regimes (γ*= 0), occurs at a critical voidage ε≈ 0. 85. The vertical two-phase flow was considered as the pseudofluid, and modified mixture-wall friction coefficient (fw) and modified mixture Reynolds number (Rem) were introduced for explanation of this system. Experimental data show that the wall-to-bed momentum, heat and mass transfer coefficients, in vertical flow of pseudofluid, for the turbulent regime are significantly higher than in parallel regime. Wall-to-bed, mass and heat transfer coefficients in hydraulic transport of particles were much higher then in single-phase flow for lower Reynolds numbers (Re 15000), there was not significant difference. The experimental data for wall-to-bed momentum, heat and mass transfer in vertical flow of pseudofluid in parallel particle flow regime, show existing analogy among these three phenomena.

40|$|It {{is thought}} that a two phase {{thermosyphon}} {{may be used to}} remove geothermal energy from a geothermal aquifer to supply energy at a rate of the order of 10 kW to a small scale user, such as a domestic dwelling. In this project a two phase thermosyphon, approximately 8 m long, was constructed and tested in order to examine design procedures and to find optimum operating conditions. The thermosyphon consisted of a 0. 6 m long evaporator section of 35 mm pipe, a 6. 20 m long, vacuum jacketed, adiabatic section of 35 mm pipe and a 1. 06 m long condenser section. Heat was supplied to the evaporator through a <b>steam</b> <b>jacket</b> using saturated steam at 140 °C and cooling water was supplied to the condenser. Two working fluids, water and hexane, were tested and a 60 mesh stainless steel wick was also used in the evaporator. When using water the maximum performance of 8740 ± 700 W was obtained at a cooling water flowrate of 34. 0 ml/s, without using a wick. This heated the cooling water to a temperature of 81 °C. When using hexane the maximum performance obtained was 2150 ± 300 W at a cooling water flowrate of 7 ml/s, without using a wick. These results compare well with the predicted values found using a calculation procedure presented by Engineering Services Data Unit, Item No. 81038. The use of accurate operating conditions when predicting the thermosyphon performance was found to be essential. The use of a simple wick in the evaporator was found to hinder heat transfer. The limiting factor is thought to be the occurrence of film boiling in the evaporator. This was not predicted by ESDU 81038. The prediction of limits to heat transfer was not accurate and more work is needed in this area. The overall results are encouraging and show {{that it is possible to}} transfer heat at a rate of the order of 10 kW, using a temperature drop of around 50 °C as is required in a domestic geothermal application...|$|E
40|$|This study, on the {{development}} of a new glue stick product based on tapioca starch for Thai consumers, had a major emphasis on the use of consumer input in the product optimization. At the beginning of {{the development}} process consumers identified the problems of existing products and generated the important attributes of glue stick products. Then product prototypes were made using mixture experimental designs and quantitative relationships between the ingredients and the product attributes were determined. For evaluating the sensory attributes of prototypes, a trained panel was employed during the development of the first prototypes and then a consumer panel in the second prototype development. Consumers not only evaluated the product attributes of the prototype products using line scales but also indicated their ideal product attribute levels. Physical attributes of the products were also measured. Multiple regression was used to generate the empirical equations showing the relationships between the ingredients and the product attributes. These linear relationships were then used to develop the constraints for a linear programming model. The consumer ideal product profile as well as the sensory profiles of the commercial products were employed to create upper and lower acceptable limits of the attributes' constraints. The raw materials and the physical properties were also included in the linear programming model. Acceptability maximization and cost minimization were used to generate the optimum formulations. The prototype products from these formulations were tested by a small consumer panel to select the one with highest acceptability. A pilot scale plant was designed and built and then a small quantity of the final formulation was produced. The final product, from the successful pilot scale production, was tested in a home-use test by 108 students and 64 office workers in Bangkok. The consumers evaluated the performance of the developed product in comparison with their 'usual brand'. The results from the consumer testing showed that the developed glue stick was generally accepted by the target consumers. However, some improvements of the product in terms of colour, aroma and packaging are still necessary. The product could be made commercially in Thailand in a simple plant using a closed stainless steel vessel with <b>steam</b> <b>jacket,</b> condenser and central anchor type mixer. Suitable packaging equipment is needed in order to maintain the high temperature of the mix while discharging the glue mixture into moulds. The product should be able to compete with the glue sticks already in the Thai market since it has the distinctive feature of adjustability and could be sold at a lower price...|$|E
