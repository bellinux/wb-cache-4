25|$|Rational {{equivalence}} of divisors (known as linear equivalence) was {{studied in}} various forms during the 19th century, leading to the ideal class group in number theory and the Jacobian variety {{in the theory of}} algebraic curves. For higher-codimension cycles, rational equivalence was introduced by Severi in the 1930s. In 1956, Wei-Liang Chow gave an influential proof that the intersection product is well-defined on cycles modulo rational equivalence for a smooth quasi-projective variety, using Chow's moving lemma. Starting in the 1970s, Fulton and MacPherson gave the current standard foundation for Chow groups, working with singular varieties wherever possible. In their theory, the intersection product for <b>smooth</b> <b>varieties</b> is constructed by deformation to the normal cone.|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} of nonsingularity of the varieties [...] and [...] appearing above {{is an important}} one. It seems natural to hope that if we start with smooth , then we can always find a minimal model or Fano fibre space inside the category of <b>smooth</b> <b>varieties.</b> However, [...] this is not true, and so it becomes necessary to consider singular varieties also. The singularities that appear are called terminal singularities.|$|E

2500|$|One {{meaning of}} the Cohen–Macaulay {{condition}} is seen in coherent duality theory. A variety or scheme X is Cohen–Macaulay if the [...] "dualizing complex", which a priori lies in the derived category of sheaves on X, is represented by a single sheaf. The stronger property of being Gorenstein means that this sheaf is a line bundle. In particular, every regular scheme is Gorenstein. Thus the statements of duality theorems such as Serre duality or Grothendieck local duality for Gorenstein or Cohen–Macaulay schemes retain some of the simplicity of what happens for regular schemes or <b>smooth</b> <b>varieties.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{the tools of}} formal algebraic geometry {{in the setting of}} noncommutative manifolds, roughly ringed spaces locally modeled on the free associative algebra. We define a notion of noncommutative coordinate system, which is a principal bundle for an appropriate group of local coordinate changes. These bundles are shown to carry a natural flat connection with properties analogous to the classical Gelfand-Kazhdan structure. Every noncommutative manifold has an underlying <b>smooth</b> <b>variety</b> given by abelianization. A basic question is existence and uniqueness of noncommutative thickenings of a <b>smooth</b> <b>variety,</b> i. e., finding noncommutative manifolds abelianizing to a given <b>smooth</b> <b>variety.</b> We obtain new results in this direction by showing that noncommutative coordinate systems always arise as reductions of structure group of the commutative bundle of coordinate systems on the underlying smooth variety; this also explains a relationship between D-modules on the commutative variety and sheaves of modules for the noncommutative structure sheaf.
