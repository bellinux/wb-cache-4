5|$|For a time, Arsaces {{consolidated}} {{his position}} in Parthia and Hyrcania {{by taking advantage of}} the invasion of Seleucid territory in the west by Ptolemy III Euergetes (r.246–222BC) of Egypt. This conflict with Ptolemy, the Third Syrian War (246–241BC), also allowed Diodotus I to rebel and form the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom in Central Asia. The latter's successor, Diodotus II, formed an alliance with Arsaces against the Seleucids, but Arsaces was temporarily driven from Parthia by the forces of Seleucus II Callinicus (r.246–225BC). After <b>spending</b> <b>some</b> time in exile among the nomadic Apasiacae tribe, Arsaces led a counterattack and recaptured Parthia. Seleucus II's successor, Antiochus III the Great (r.222–187BC), was unable to immediately retaliate because his troops were engaged in putting down the rebellion of Molon in Media.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, after <b>spending</b> <b>some</b> {{two years in}} Medan with the daily Sinar Soematra, Andjar {{returned}} to Batavia and in 1929 helped establish the magazine Doenia Film, a Malay adaptation of the Dutch-language magazine Filmland; although an adaptation, Doenia Film also contained original coverage of the domestic theatre and film industry. At the time, the cinema of the Indies was becoming established: the first domestic film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng (The Lost Lutung), was released in 1926, and four additional films were released in 1927 and 1928. Andjar wrote extensively regarding local cinematic and theatrical productions; for example, the Indonesian film critic Salim Said writes Andjar inspired the marketing for 1929's Njai Dasima, which emphasised the exclusively native cast. In 1930 Andjar left Doenia Film {{and was replaced by}} Bachtiar Effendi.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys dimidiatus {{is known}} from three {{specimens}} {{collected in the}} lowlands of the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region in southeastern Nicaragua. The first, an old male, was collected on November5, 1904, in a banana plantation with very moist red clay on the Río Escondido near El Rama. The second, a young adult male, was caught on July26, 1966, in dense cane on the south bank of the Río Mico at El Recreo, 15km (9mi) west from {{the location of the}} first specimen, along with three other rice rats (O.couesi, Melanomys caliginosus, and Oligoryzomys fulvescens), the cotton rat Sigmodon hirsutus, and the cottontail rabbit Sylvilagus brasiliensis. The third was caught at a stream near Bluefields. Reid suggested that the species is semiaquatic, <b>spending</b> <b>some</b> time in the water, like other Oryzomys.|$|E

5|$|O'Sullivan then won {{his third}} Irish Masters title, by {{defeating}} Matthew Stevens 10–8. He then missed the China Open on medical grounds; {{for which he}} was criticised by Anthony Hamilton, who said that O'Sullivan had a duty to promote the sport overseas. In the World Championship, O'Sullivan lost to Peter Ebdon in the quarter-final. From 2–8 down, Ebdon began a comeback and eventually won 13–11, by playing in an exceptionally determined and dogged style, with many observers accusing him of deliberate slow play to disrupt O'Sullivan's fast game. After the match, O'Sullivan indicated to the press that he was unlikely to compete in the following season, and would perhaps even retire from the sport altogether. O'Sullivan participated in the Premier League. After finishing third in the table after the league stage, O'Sullivan defeated Hendry 5–0 in the semi-finals, and Williams 6–0 in the final. In September 2005, he announced that he would play a truncated 2005/2006 season, <b>spending</b> <b>some</b> time playing eight-ball pool in the United States, having been chosen to compete on the elite International Pool Tour.|$|E
5|$|Having {{arranged}} to travel back overland from Peking to rendezvous with Alceste at Canton, Amherst was ferried {{to the mouth}} of the Hai River on 9 August. As the mission and return journey would take several weeks, Maxwell had an opportunity to explore the area. Alceste headed north, while Lyra, under the command of Lieutenant Basil Hall, was sent south. General Hewitt, an East Indiaman chartered to carry gifts for the Emperor of China, was to explore the centre channel. Alceste first undertook a survey of the Gulf of Liaodong, at that time virtually unknown to Europeans, and after <b>spending</b> <b>some</b> time exploring the Liaodong Peninsula, proceeded southward to Jiaozhou Bay on the coast of Shandong, where she encountered General Hewitt, and was later joined by Hall in Lyra. Alceste and Lyra left the bay on 29 August for the west coast of Korea, an area that had not been surveyed since the Jesuit missionaries visited in the 16th and 17th centuries. Maxwell found the Korean coast to be some 130 miles further east than expected, and in the process of exploration also discovered the archipelago that forms the south-western tip of the Korean peninsula. Alceste was then turned towards the Loo Choo Islands, now known as the Ryukyu archipelago, dropping anchor in the Napakiang roads on the south-west side of Okinawa on 16 September 1816. After a six-week stay, Alceste returned to China via {{the southern end of the}} island of Taiwan, arriving at the mouth of the Pearl River on 2 November.|$|E
