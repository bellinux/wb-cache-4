However, <b>seasonal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> can cause soil temperature fluctuations and possibly deformation of soft clays. This thesis evaluates the thermo-mechanical response of soft clays to <b>seasonal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> and associated temperature fluctuations. A literature review reveals that, in normally consolidated to lightly overconsolidated clays, increases in soil temperature can lead to significant plastic strains {{and a reduction in}} soil strength. This behavior can be modeled through constitutive formulations that include thermal strain within the elasto-plastic framework of the well-known Modified Cam-Clay Model. The current research uses the MCC Picard (1994) model to study the ground response to a buried heat exchange pipe. The spacing of the pipe was found to govern the effectiveness of ground heat storage. With only one pipe in semi-infinite soil, heat transfer to the ground dissipates quickly and thermal-mechanical interaction is negligible; however, <b>seasonal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> is not possible.

The low heat release found for MgSO 4. 7 H 2 O is mainly attributed to the amorphization of the material during the dehydration performed at 13 mbar which reduces its sorption capacity during the rehydration.

40|$|AbstractIn France, {{housing and}} {{tertiary}} buildings {{are responsible for}} the consumption of approximately 46 % of all energies and approximately 19 % of the total CO 2 emissions. As demand in thermal comfort of buildings rises, the energy consumption correspondingly increases. For example, in France, the energy consumption of buildings has increased by 30 % in the last 30 years. Energy performance of buildings is key to achieve the EU Climate & Energy objectives, namely the reduction of a 20 % of the Greenhouse gases emissions by 2020 and a 20 % energy savings by 2020. Improving the energy performance of buildings is a cost- effective way of fighting against climate change and improving energy security, while also creating job opportunities, particularly in the building sector. Thermal energy storage systems could make an important contribution in reducing our dependency on fossil fuels, but also in contributing to a more efficient and environmentally benign energy use. The annual solar energy incident on a low-energy building surfaces is far greater than the building needs for space heating and hot water, especially during the summer season. It is obvious that a long-term thermal energy storage system is a means to rationalize the use of this renewable energy. Thermal energy storage can be accomplished either by using sensible <b>heat</b> <b>storage,</b> latent <b>heat</b> <b>storage,</b> physical sorption, <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> or chemical <b>heat</b> <b>storage.</b> Chemical <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> has the highest potential for <b>seasonal</b> <b>heat</b> storage: the <b>storage</b> density is high and there is no heat loss to the environment during storage.

40|$|Composite {{materials}} {{based on}} a silica gel loaded with CaCl 2 are of great interest for <b>seasonal</b> thermochemical <b>heat</b> <b>storage.</b> In order to improve the performance of these materials for this application, and to evaluate their multi-cycle stability, a new synthesis protocol is proposed, based on successive impregnation/drying steps by using a matrix with a broad pore size distribution. Through this method, a CaCl 2 content of 43 wt%, a high cycle loading lift of 0. 40 g/g and an unprecedented energy storage density {{for this type of}} material of 211 kW h/m 3 of packed bed composite, in conditions of a solar <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> system (adsorption at 30 °C, desorption at 80 °C, and water vapor pressure of 12. 5 mbar) can be reached. Moreover, the distribution of the salt inside the pores and the absence of any salt crust outside the matrix prevent salt leakage, leading to an outstanding preservation of the cycle loading lift after 10 cycles. Based on Polanyi theory, it can be assumed that the energy storage density can exceed 350 kW h/m 3 for water sorption at 20 °C, desorption at 80 °C, with both steps at a water vapor pressure of 12. 5 mbar.

40|$|A {{literature}} review is performed {{in order to}} collect and analyse the thermodynamic data of an utmost number of salt hydrate reactions (i. e., 563 reactions are reviewed). These data allow us to evaluate the theoretical possibilities and limitations of salt hydrates as thermochemical materials (TCMs) for <b>seasonal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> in the built environment (1 GJ/m 3 on system level). Two filters are used for evaluation. Filter 1 including three criteria i. e., an ideal hydration reaction with a capacity larger than 2 GJ/m 3, a hydration temperature of 65 °C (suitable for domestic hot water) or higher, a dehydration temperature below 100 °C to profit {{as much as possible}} from the solar heat that can be harvested. Only four of the studied hydrates fit with these demands. For selecting a larger number of hydrates, a second filter is introduced with less demanding constraints. It is expected that modifications on heat storage system level are needed to reach an acceptable system performance with the hydrates selected through filter 2 (hydration reaction with a capacity larger than 1. 3 GJ/m 3, a hydration temperature of 50 °C or higher, a dehydration temperature below 120 °C). Based on this filter, a shortlist of 25 TCM hydrate reactions are identified, including the four of filter 1. The shortlist is analyzed by considering price, chemical stability, reaction kinetics and safety for domestic environment. Based on this additional analysis with the used constraints, K 2 CO 3 is determined to be the most promising candidate for open or closed systems, but has a low energy density. Based on the review of 563 hydrate reactions, we concluded that no ideal salt exists for <b>seasonal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> under the considered boundary conditions. With the current concept of <b>seasonal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storage,</b> including closed and open systems, whereby only one dehydration cycle per year is performed under a system energy density of 1 GJ/m 3, it is not realistic for large scale implementation to use pure salt hydrates as heat storage material. By adjusting the constraints, such as multiple cycles per year or higher water vapor pressures, salt hydrates can still be used as TCMs. It should be mentioned that MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O, MgSO 4 · 6 H 2 O and CaCl 2 · 6 H 2 O are not listed in our shortlist of 25 TCMs, although these hydrates are commonly suggested in the literature as promising TCM for <b>seasonal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storage.</b> The present study on pT-characteristics shows, however, that these salts are not fitting the demands of such a heat storage system...|$|E
40|$|Water vapor {{sorption}} in {{salt hydrates}} {{is one of}} the most promising means for compact, low loss, and long-term storage of solar heat in the built environment. One of the most interesting salt hydrates for compact <b>seasonal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> is magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O). This paper describes the characterization of MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O to examine its suitability for application in a <b>seasonal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> system for the built environment. Both charging (dehydration) and discharging (hydration) behaviors of the material were studied using thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, particle distribution measurements, and scanning electron microscope. The experimental results show that MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O can be dehydrated at temperatures below 150 °C, which can be reached by a medium temperature (vacuum tube) collector. Additionally, the material was able to store 2. 2 GJ/m 3, almost nine times more energy than can be stored in water as sensible heat. On the other hand, the experimental results indicate that the release of the stored heat is more difficult. The amount of water taken up and the energy released by the material turned out to be strongly dependent on the water vapor pressure, temperature, and the total system pressure. The results of this study indicate that the application of MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O at atmospheric pressure is problematic for a heat storage system where heat is released above 40 °C using a water vapor pressure of 1. 3 kPa. However, first experiments performed in a closed system at low pressure indicate that a small amount of heat can be released at 50 °C and a water vapor pressure of 1. 3 kPa. If a heat storage system has to operate at atmospheric pressure, then the application of MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O for <b>seasonal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> is possible for space heating operating at 25 °C and a water vapor pressure of 2. 1 kPa...|$|E

The use of porous adsorbents {{in the field of}} <b>seasonal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> in building is an attractive solution for the reducing of energy consumption as well as improving thermal comfort [1]. In recent years, there have been significant research progresses on microporous adsorbent materials for closed/open systems [2]. Thermochemical heat storage (TCS) is based on the reversible chemical and physical sorption of gases, mostly water vapor, in solid. The water adsorption capacity and heat generated are the most important properties for adsorbents in such TCS system. This study focuses on the determination of sorption capacity and heats of adsorption/desorption of water vapor for different zeolites (MOR, CLP, K-L, 3 A, 4 A, 5 A, Na-X, Na-Y, H-Y, Ca-X and Li-X) and zeolite-type materials like SAPO and AlPO. The measured heats of dehydration (kJ. kg- 1) varied in the 360 - 950 kJ. kg- 1 range for the different samples that present also different water vapor sorption capacities (from 0. 09 kgH 2 O. kg- 1 to 0. 26 kgH 2 O. kg- 1). This behavior {{can be attributed to the}} strong interaction of water molecules with the electronegativity of charge-balancing cations of the different zeolites and with the pore size. Relationships between water adsorption in zeolites, the porous structure, the Si/Al ratio, the zeolite framework and the compensating cation have been established. The knowledge of the structural modifications induced by temperature and of the stability of these materials is of prime importance to ensure their durability and effectiveness for <b>seasonal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> applications...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} discuss the values and daily {{variation}} characteristics of <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> fluxes in a tropical seasonal rain forest in Xishuangbanna, the sensible and latent <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> flux within air column, canopy <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> flux, energy storage by photosynthesis and ground <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> above the soil heat flux plate, {{as well as the}} ratios of these <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> fluxes to the net radiation in the cool-dry, hot-dry and rainy season were compared and analyzed based on the observation data of carbon fluxes, meteorological factors and biomass within this tropical seasonal rain forest from January 2003 to December 2004. The findings showed that <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> terms ranged significantly in the daytime and weakly in the nighttime, and the absolute values of sensible and latent <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> fluxes were obviously greater than other <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> terms in all seasons. In addition, the absolute values of total <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> fluxes reached the peak in the hot-dry season, then were higher in the rainy season, and reached the minimum in the cool-dry season. The ratios of <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> fluxes to net radiation generally decreased with time in the daytime, moreover, the sensible and latent <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> dominated a considerable fraction of net radiation, while other <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> contents occupied a smaller fraction of the net radiation and the peak value was not above 3. 5 %. In the daytime, the ratios of the total <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> to net radiation were greater and differences in these ratios were distinct among seasons before 12 : 00, and then they became lower and differences were small among seasons after 12 : 00. The energy closure was improved when the storage terms were considered in the energy balance, which indicated that <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> terms should not been neglected. The energy closure of tropical seasonal rain forest was not very well due to effects of many factors. The results would help us to further understand energy transfer and mass exchange between tropical forest and atmosphere. Moreover, they would supply a research basis for studying energy closure at other places...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to investigate <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> in a <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit utilizing a phase change material (PCM). This included finding an optimal geometry for heat transfer from the <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit to the surroundings, finding an effective thermal conductivity of the PCM, and combine these in an overall PCM <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> model. The advantage of using a PCM is that the PCM can store large amounts of heat in liquid phase as latent heat. This will contribute to a stable heat release to the surroundings. Methods for enhancing the heat transfer from a PCM <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit to the surroundings were studied. The research considered both free convection and radiation heat transfer. Further objectives were to find a suitable geometry of fins for heat rejection to the surroundings. Heat transfer from two different fin arrangements to the surroundings were investigated, a fin array and fin channels. The dimensions of the geometries were optimized. Both geometries showed satisfying results, but {{it was concluded that}} fin channels were preferable to a fin array. A <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit was investigated experimentally. The experiments considered two different setups, supplying heat to the <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> units top surface, and supplying heat to the bottom surface. The results were compared to results from numerical simulations. The <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit <b>heated</b> from the top surface showed good agreement compared to results from numerical simulations. The <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit <b>heated</b> from below proved that heat transfer by free convection in the liquid phase {{had a significant impact on}} the melting pace of the PCM. The comparison with results from numerical simulations did however not show an immediate agreement. The effective thermal conductivity of the PCM was found based on the experiments and compared to literature values. An uncertainty analysis was performed on the obtained effective conductivity. The results showed that the method employed for studying the effective conductivity was inaccurate. An overall <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> model was developed to combine <b>heat</b> supply, <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> and <b>heat</b> distribution. The simulations were performed using PCM as well as PCM with aluminium foam to enhance the heat distribution in the <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit and the heat transfer rate to the surroundings. The heat supplied to the <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit was based on calculations of batch combustion of wood. The results showed that none of the tests for the PCM <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit, or the optimization of the PCM <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit, reached the requirements of heat transfer to the surroundings set for the model. The length of the PCM <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit was also proved to be excessive...|$|R
