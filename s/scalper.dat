After arranging for a <b>scalper</b> to come to Leonard's apartment, they begin to get worried, remembering Sheldon's warning {{that they could get}} charged for petty theft, then have to disclose the crime in the future. When the <b>scalper</b> is heard arriving, they quickly turn off the lights and stay silent.|$|E
25|$|Public {{attention}} for their {{meeting in the}} tournament final was immense, and <b>scalper</b> ticket prices went through the roof. Roofs and windows of nearby buildings were also crowded with spectators. The match itself saw Lenglen clinging on to a 6–3, 8–6 victory after being close to a collapse on several occasions.|$|E
25|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} {{progress}} of the film, Grant had Massot removed from the project and Australian director Peter Clifton was hired in his place in early 1974. Massot was offered a few thousand pounds in compensation. Peter Grant later sent someone to Massot's house to collect the film. However, Massot had hidden the film elsewhere and so instead an expensive editing machine owned by Massot was taken as collateral. Massot served a writ, leading to a period of stalemate which was finally broken when Grant and Led Zeppelin's lawyer Steve Weiss agreed to pay Massot the money he was owed, after which he delivered the film to the band. Massot was not invited to attend the premiere of the film at New York but he attended anyway, buying a ticket from a <b>scalper</b> outside the theatre.|$|E

50|$|Notoriously outspoken {{about his}} disgust with <b>scalpers,</b> Church {{and his team}} have come up with an {{intricate}} digital system that aims to ensure all tickets are sold at face value — and thus kept out of scalpers' hands. On February 21, 2017, Church had to cancel 25,000 tickets purchased by <b>scalpers.</b> Church stated:It drives me fucking crazy… The problem I have is that <b>scalpers</b> have a bazillion people working for them. And they have those bots that scan. So it's not fair. I've been told to raise my prices. But there's guys out there that want to come to a show and bring their family to a show and are working a blue-collar job, they were there for us in bars and clubs, so I should raise to $100 because that's what the <b>scalpers</b> think? I refuse to believe that.|$|R

25|$|On February 16, 1926, the 20-year-old Wills met Suzanne Lenglen, six-time Wimbledon champion, in {{the final}} of a tournament at the Carlton Club in Cannes. It {{was the only time}} they played each other. Public {{anticipation}} of their match was immense, resulting in high <b>scalper</b> ticket prices. Roofs and windows of nearby buildings were crowded with spectators, including the King Gustaf V of Sweden. Both players were nervous, with Lenglen drinking brandy and water at one point to calm her nerves. Lenglen won the match 6–3, 8–6 after being down 2–1 in the first set and 5–4 in the second set. Wills had a set point in the second set and believed she had won the point, but a linesman disagreed. In {{one of the few times}} she showed emotion on court, she spoke angrily to the linesman over the call. After the match, Lenglen's father advised her that she would lose her next match to Wills if they met again soon, and Lenglen avoided Wills for the remainder of the spring. Wills did not get a second chance to meet Lenglen. Wills had an emergency appendectomy during the 1926 French Championships, which caused her to default her second round match and withdraw from Wimbledon, which also was considered a default. Lenglen turned professional after the 1926 season.|$|E

6000|$|Up in {{the office}} Mr. <b>Scalper</b> has reached the letter of a {{correspondent}} which appears to give him particular pleasure, for he delineates the character with a beaming smile of satisfaction.

5000|$|In 2002, Weingust {{argued that}} the City of Toronto {{had no right to}} charge ticket <b>scalpers</b> with an offense.

6000|$|The {{lowering}} {{of the bottle}} interrupts Policeman Hogan. The long letter to Aunt Dorothea has cooled the ardour of Mr. <b>Scalper.</b> The generous blush has passed from his mind {{and he has been}} trying in vain to restore it. To afford Hogan a similar opportunity, he decides not to haul the bottle up immediately, but to leave it in his custody while he delineates a character. The writing of this correspondent would seem to the inexperienced eye to be that of a timid little maiden in her teens. Mr. <b>Scalper</b> is not to be deceived by appearances. He shakes his head mournfully at the letter and writes: ...|$|E

The baffled delineator lets fall the string and returns to finish his task. Only a few lines are now required to fill the column, but Mr. <b>Scalper</b> finds on examining the correspondence that he has exhausted the subjects. This, however, is quite a common occurrence and occasions no dilemma {{in the mind of the}} talented gentleman.
