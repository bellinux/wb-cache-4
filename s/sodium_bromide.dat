Vesicles size and charge density are tuned by changing the mole ratio between oppositely charged species, at fixed overall surfactant content. They are also modulated by adding neutral electrolytes, or raising T. In the investigated regions, mixtures made of <b>sodium</b> dodecylsulfate/hexadecyltrimethylammonium <b>bromide</b> show ideality of mixing, the other non ideality and phase separation.

25|$|The process uses a cobalt–manganese–bromide catalyst. The bromide source can be <b>sodium</b> <b>bromide,</b> {{hydrogen}} bromide or tetrabromoethane where bromine {{functions as a}} regenerative source of free radicals. In this process, acetic acid is the solvent and oxygen from compressed air is the oxidant. The combination of bromine and acetic acid {{is found to be}} highly corrosive and hence the equipment is lined with titanium. A feed mixture containing p-xylene, acetic acid, the catalyst system, and compressed air is fed to a reactor. The oxidation of the methyl group takes place in two steps where p-xylene is converted to p-toluic acid and the byproduct undesirable 4-carboxybenzaldehyde along with crude p-toluic acid. It is further purified to obtain the p-toluic acid with the removal of the 4-carboxybenzaldehyde using crystallization, centrifugation and filtration. 98% of the p-xylene is reacted to give more than 95mol% TPA. The solvent losses are comparatively low, and hence the Amoco process is followed by the industries.|$|E

40|$|Synthetic vesicles were {{prepared}} by mixing anionic and cationic surfactants, aqueous sodium dodecylsulfate with didodecyltrimethylammonium or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. The overall surfactant {{content and the}} (anionic/cationic) mole ratios allow one to obtain negatively charged vesicles. In the phase diagram, the vesicular region is located between a solution phase, a lamellar liquid crystalline dispersion, and a precipitate area. Characterization of the vesicles was performed by electrophoretic mobility, NMR, TEM, and DLS and we determined their uni-lamellar character, size, stability, and charge density. Negatively charged vesicular dispersions, made of <b>sodium</b> dodecylsulfate/didodecyltrimethylammonium <b>bromide</b> or <b>sodium</b> dodecylsulfate/cetyltrimethylammonium <b>bromide,</b> were mixed with lysozyme, to form lipoplexes. Depending on the protein/vesicle charge ratio, binding, surface saturation, and lipoplexes flocculation, or precipitation, occurs. The free protein in excess remains in solution, after binding saturation. The systems were investigated by thermodynamic (surface tension and solution calorimetry), DLS, CD, TEM, H- 1 NMR, transport properties, electrophoretic mobility, and dielectric relaxation. The latter two methods give information on the vesicle charge neutralization by adsorbed protein. Binding is concomitant to modifications in the double layer thickness of vesicles and in the surface charge density of the resulting lipoplexes. This is also confirmed by developing the electrophoretic mobility results {{in terms of a}} Langmuir-like adsorption isotherm. Charges in excess with respect to the amount required to neutralize the vesicle surface promote lipoplexes clustering and/or flocculation. Protein-vesicle interactions were observed by DLS, indicating changes in particle size (and in their distribution functions) upon addition of LYSO. According to CD, the bound protein retains its native conformation, at least in the SDS/CTAB vesicular system. In fact, changes in the alpha-helix and beta-sheet conformations are moderate, if any. Calorimetric methods indicate that the maximum heat effect for LYSO binding occurs at charge neutralization. They also indicate that enthalpic are by far the dominant contributions to the system stability. Accordingly, energy effects associated with charge neutralization and double-layer contributions are much higher than counterion exchange and dehydration terms...|$|R

For the pre-injection and injection periods three principal components explained 76. 6 % and 80. 0 % of the total data variance, respectively. Analysis of the pre-injection data set determined that highly positive loadings for total dissolved solids, chloride, <b>bromide,</b> <b>sodium,</b> magnesium, potassium, and electrical conductance designated the first component (PC 1) as the salinity factor. High loadings for calcium, iron, and sulfate in component two (PC 2) represents an oxidation-reduction component.
