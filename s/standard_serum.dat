Methods: 932 cases of acute flaccid paralysis, reported in 2008 - 2009, were tested for presence of polio and non-polio enteroviruses according to the WHO <b>standards.</b> <b>Serum</b> IgA and IgG levels were determined by sandwich ELISA.

The German quality-control methodology was copied by government serum institutes all over the world, and they also obtained the <b>standard</b> <b>serum</b> from Frankfurt. After diphtheria antiserum, tetanus serum and various bactericide serums for use in veterinary medicine were developed in rapid sequence. These were also evaluated at the institute, as was tuberculin and later on various vaccines.

40|$|A {{workable}} {{relationship was}} established between the <b>standard</b> <b>serum</b> titers of staphylococcal immune antisera {{and the development}} of precipitin zones on serum agar around colonies of staphylococcal strains producing homologous antigens (enterotoxins). The standard titer of a serum is defined as the reciprocal of that serum dilution which, with 10 μg of pure enterotoxin per ml, will give a precipitin zone 10 mm in length in single gel-diffusion tubes after 7 days of incubation at 25 C. A numerical scale was set up for determining the intensity of precipitin zones on serum agar. A reading of 3 was considered optimum. This correlated well with a <b>standard</b> <b>serum</b> titer of 25, when 1 ml of such a serum was used per 20 ml of medium per serum plate. From this relationship, the minimum volume of serum required to give optimum precipitin zone development can be calculated...|$|E
40|$|Background The Sino-MONICA {{project is}} a 7 -year study {{monitoring}} trends and determinants of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in geographically defined populations {{in different parts of}} China. This report focuses on risk factor levels and their relations to CVD rates. Design Successive surveys on smoking habits, blood pressure (BP), serum total cholesterol (TC), weight and height were conducted in independent random samples of the same populations early (1987 – 1988) and late (1992 – 1993) in the study period, by the methodology and criteria of the WHO MONICA project. Associations between risk levels and CVD rates were also assessed by correlation analysis. Results In general, the mean level of BP in the populations studied was high by international <b>standards.</b> <b>Serum</b> TC and body mass index (BMI) were low compared with the world average. There were significant geographic variations in CVD risk levels, being higher in the north and lower in the south, which correlated with the north–south difference of CVD event rates. Conclusions The Sino-MONICA study has established the feasibility of long-term monitoring of CVD events and risk factors with international standardized methods in Chinese communities. The results will have significance in curbing the CV...|$|R

In use it gave clear zones of haemolysis when a <b>standard</b> <b>serum</b> was tested at dilutions down to 5. 6 i. u. /ml rubella antibody. In five laboratories 8404 sera were screened by the method {{and the results}} were read by comparing zones of haemolysis with that of a <b>standard</b> <b>serum</b> diluted to contain 15 i. u/ml antibody. A zone {{greater than or equal to}} 15 i. u. /ml, indicating immunity, was given by 7433 (88. 4 %) of the sera. No zone indicating susceptibility was seen with 748 (8. 9 %) sera. Small zones, less than 15 i. u. /ml standard, were given by 189 (2. 2 %) sera, and in only 34 cases (0. 4 %) did non-specific haemolysis interfere with the test readings. Further testing of the radial haemolysis interfere with the test readings.

40|$|Brucellosis is {{widespread}} among humans and animals. Diagnosis of brucellosis mostly depends on serological methods. Serological tests are preferred over time-consuming and hazardous bacterial cultures in routine laboratory practice. However, these tests are somehow challenging due to ‘incomplete/blocking antibodies’ that prevent agglutination. Brucella Coombs gel test (BCGT) is newly developed test that contains Coombs antibodies (anti-human IgG) in gel microtubes and depends on gel centrifugation methods for the serological diagnosis of brucellosis. Here, {{performance of the}} BCGT is compared with <b>standard</b> <b>serum</b> tube agglutination (STA), <b>standard</b> <b>serum</b> tube agglutination with Coombs (C-STA) and immune capture agglutination (Brucellacapt).

Titres at 1 : 160 and above were considered positive for brucellosis, whereas those lower than 1 : 160 were considered negative. Excellent agreement levels were determined between BCGT test and C-STA (κ, 0. 894; p < 0. 001), and BCGT and Brucellacapt (κ, 0. 802; p < 0. 001), when the diagnostic titre was accepted as 1 : 160.
