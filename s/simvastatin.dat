5|$|Warfarin {{interacts with}} many {{commonly}} used drugs, and the metabolism of warfarin varies greatly between patients. Some foods {{have also been}} reported to interact with warfarin. Apart from the metabolic interactions, highly protein bound drugs can displace warfarin from serum albumin and cause {{an increase in the}} INR. This makes finding the correct dosage difficult, and accentuates the need of monitoring; when initiating a medication that is known to interact with warfarin (e.g. <b>simvastatin),</b> INR checks are increased or dosages adjusted until a new ideal dosage is found.|$|E
5|$|In chapter five Goldacre {{suggests}} {{using the}} General Practice Research Database in the UK, which contains the anonymized records of several million patients, to conduct randomized trials {{to determine the}} most effective of competing treatments. For example, to compare two statins, atorvastatin and <b>simvastatin,</b> doctors would randomly assign patients to one or the other. The patients would be followed up by having data about their cholesterol levels, heart attacks, strokes and deaths taken from their computerized medical records. The trials would not be blind– patients would know which statin they had been prescribed– but Goldacre writes {{that they would be}} unlikely to hold such firm beliefs about which one is preferable {{to the extent that it}} could affect their health.|$|E
25|$|<b>Simvastatin</b> is {{contraindicated}} with pregnancy, breastfeeding, {{and liver}} disease. Pregnancy must be avoided while on <b>simvastatin</b> due to potentially severe birth defects. Patients cannot breastfeed while on <b>simvastatin</b> due to potentially disrupting the infant's lipid metabolism. High doses of <b>simvastatin</b> are also contraindicated with the widely used antihypertensive amlodipine. A lower dose is also recommended in people taking the calcium channel blockers, verapamil and diltiazem, {{as well as}} those taking amiodarone.|$|E
25|$|On August 8, 2008, the FDA {{issued a}} {{warning of the}} risk of rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to kidney failure or death, when <b>simvastatin</b> is used with amiodarone. This {{interaction}} is dose-dependent with <b>simvastatin</b> doses exceeding 20mg. This drug combination especially with higher doses of <b>simvastatin</b> should be avoided.|$|E
25|$|In the Scandinavian <b>Simvastatin</b> Survival Study (a placebo-controlled, {{randomized}} {{clinical trial}} of 5 years duration), <b>simvastatin</b> reduced overall mortality {{in people with}} existing cardiovascular disease and high LDL cholesterol by 30% and reduced cardiovascular mortality by 42%. The risks of heart attack, stroke, or needing a coronary revascularization procedure were reduced by 37%, 28%, and 37% respectively.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{per patient}} {{costs to the}} UK NHS are £18.03–26.02/month (compared to £0.85–1.37/month for <b>simvastatin).</b>|$|E
25|$|Erythromycin is metabolized by enzymes of the {{cytochrome}} P450 system, in particular, by isozymes of the CYP3A superfamily, CYP3A. The {{activity of}} the CYP3A enzymes can be induced or inhibited by certain drugs (e.g. dexamethasone) which can cause it to affect the metabolism of many different drugs, e.g. erythromycin. If other CYP3A substrates — drugs that are broken down by CYP3A — such as <b>simvastatin</b> (Zocor), lovastatin (Mevacor), or atorvastatin (Lipitor)—are taken concomitantly with erythromycin, levels of the substrates increase, often causing adverse effects. A noted drug interaction involves erythromycin and <b>simvastatin,</b> resulting in increased <b>simvastatin</b> levels {{and the potential for}} rhabdomyolysis. Another group of CYP3A4 substrates are drugs used for migraine such as ergotamine and dihydroergotamine; their adverse effects may be more pronounced if erythromycin is associated.|$|E
25|$|Lovastatin {{is derived}} from a fungus source and <b>simvastatin</b> and {{pravastatin}} are chemical modifications of lovastatin {{and as a result}} do not differ much in structure from lovastatin. All three are partially reduced napthylene ring structures. <b>Simvastatin</b> and lovastatin are inactive lactones which must be metabolized to their active hydroxy-acid forms in order to inhibit HMGR. Type 2 statins all exist in their active hydroxy-acid forms. Fluvastatin has indole ring structure, while atorvastatin and rosuvastatin have pyrrole and pyrimidine based ring structure respectively. The lipophilic cerivastatin has a pyridine-based ring structure.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparison}} of atorvastatin, pravastatin and <b>simvastatin,</b> {{based on their}} effectiveness against placebos, found, at commonly prescribed doses, no differences among the statins in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and lipids.|$|E
25|$|Vytorin is {{drug that}} {{combines}} the use <b>simvastatin</b> and ezetimibe, which slows {{the formation of}} cholesterol by every cell in the body, along with ezetimibe reducing absorption of cholesterol, typically by about 53%, from the intestines.|$|E
25|$|While {{no direct}} {{comparison}} exists, all statins appear effective regardless of potency or degree of cholesterol reduction. There do {{appear to be}} some differences between them, with <b>simvastatin</b> and pravastatin appearing superior in terms of side-effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{rosuvastatin}} on LDL cholesterol are dose-related. Higher doses were more efficacious {{in improving the}} lipid profile of patients with hypercholesterolemia than milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin and milligram-equivalent or higher doses of <b>simvastatin</b> and pravastatin.|$|E
25|$|The primary uses of <b>simvastatin</b> are {{to treat}} dyslipidemia {{and to prevent}} atherosclerosis-related {{complications}} such as stroke and heart attacks in those who are at high risk. It is recommended {{to be used as}} an addition to a low cholesterol diet.|$|E
25|$|<b>Simvastatin,</b> marketed {{under the}} trade name Zocor among others, is a lipid-lowering medication. It is used along with exercise, diet, {{and weight loss}} to {{decrease}} elevated lipid (fat) levels. It {{is also used to}} decrease the risk of heart problems in those at high risk. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|As with atorvastatin, <b>simvastatin,</b> {{and other}} statin drugs metabolized via CYP3A4, {{drinking}} grapefruit juice during lovastatin therapy {{may increase the}} risk of side effects. Components of grapefruit juice, the flavonoid naringin, or the furanocoumarin bergamottin inhibit CYP3A4 in vitro, and may account for the in vivo effect of grapefruit juice concentrate decreasing the metabolic clearance of lovastatin, and increasing its plasma concentrations.|$|E
25|$|On March 19, 2010, the FDA issued another {{statement}} regarding <b>simvastatin,</b> {{saying it}} {{increases the risk of}} muscle injury (myopathy) when taken at high doses or at lower doses in combination with other drugs. The highest dose rate causes muscle damage in 610 of every 10,000 people in contrast to a lower dose, which causes muscle damage in eight of 10,000 people.|$|E
25|$|These drugs include {{rosuvastatin}} (CRESTOR), lovastatin (Mevacor), atorvastatin (Lipitor), pravastatin (Pravachol), fluvastatin (Lescol), pitavastatin (Livalo), and <b>simvastatin</b> (Zocor). Red yeast rice extract, {{one of the}} fungal {{sources from}} which the statins were discovered, contains several naturally occurring cholesterol-lowering molecules known as monacolins. The most active of these is monacolin K, or lovastatin (previously sold under the trade name Mevacor, and now available as generic lovastatin).|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} (>1% incidence) may include {{indigestion}} and eczema. Rare side effects include joint pain, memory loss, and muscle cramps. Cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, rhabdomyolysis (destruction of muscles and blockade of renal system), and myositis {{have been reported}} in patients receiving the drug chronically. Serious allergic reactions to <b>simvastatin</b> are rare. If the following signs of a serious allergic reaction occur, seek medical attention immediately: rash, hoarsness itching/swelling, dizziness, or difficulty swallowing/breathing.|$|E
25|$|A type of DNA variant {{known as}} a single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism (SNP) may help predict individuals prone to developing myopathy when taking simvastatin; a study ultimately including 32,000 patients concluded the carriers {{of one or two}} risk alleles of a particular SNP, rs4149056, were at a five-fold or 16-fold increased risk, respectively. In 2012, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium has released guidelines regarding the use of rs4149056 genotype in guiding dosing of <b>simvastatin</b> and updated the guideline in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Its use is advised {{against in}} people on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, chloramphenicol, ketoconazole, {{ritonavir}} and nefazodone {{due to its}} reliance on CYP3A4 for metabolism. Likewise it is a CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 inhibitor and hence concurrent treatment with substrates {{of any of these}} enzymes may increase plasma concentrations of said drugs. Since imatinib is mainly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4, substances influencing the activity of this enzyme change the plasma concentration of the drug. An example of a drug that increases imatinib activity and therefore side effects by blocking CYP3A4 is ketoconazole. The same could be true of itraconazole, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, among others. Conversely, CYP3A4 inductors like rifampicin and St. John's Wort reduce the drug's activity, risking therapy failure. Imatinib also acts as an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 2C9 and 2D6, increasing the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs like <b>simvastatin,</b> ciclosporin, pimozide, warfarin, metoprolol, and possibly paracetamol. The drug also reduces plasma levels of levothyroxin via an unknown mechanism.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} chapter, Goldacre looks at how doctors are persuaded to {{prescribe}} [...] "me-too drugs," [...] brand-name {{drugs that are}} no more effective than significantly cheaper off-patent ones. He cites as examples the statins atorvastatin (Lipitor, made by Pfizer) and <b>simvastatin</b> (Zocor), which he writes seem to be equally effective, or at least {{there is no evidence}} to suggest otherwise. <b>Simvastatin</b> came off patent several years ago, yet there are still three million prescriptions a year in the UK for atorvastatin, costing the National Health Service (NHS) an annual £165 million extra.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Simvastatin</b> {{has been}} used to explore whether statins have an effect on delaying on the onset and {{progression}} of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Results from one trial showed participants assigned to <b>simvastatin</b> had lower odds (0.51 OR) of having AMD progression at three years compared to those assigned to placebo, though the results were not significant. Overall, [...] there is insufficient evidence to conclude that <b>simvastatin</b> has an effect in delaying the onset and progression of AMD.|$|E
2500|$|The Heart Protection Study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} <b>simvastatin</b> in people with risk factors including existing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or stroke but having relatively low LDL cholesterol. [...] In this trial, which lasted 5.4 years, overall mortality was reduced by 13% and cardiovascular mortality was reduced by 18%. [...] People receiving <b>simvastatin</b> experienced 38% fewer non-fatal heart attacks and 25% fewer strokes.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Simvastatin</b> was {{developed}} by Merck and came into medical use in 1992. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is 0.01 to 0.12 USD per day [...] In the United States it costs between 0.50 and 1.00 USD per day. <b>Simvastatin</b> is made from the fungus Aspergillus terreus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{drug was}} billed as a [...] "super-statin" [...] during its {{clinical}} development; the claim was that it offers high potency and improved cholesterol reduction compared to rivals in the class. The main competitors to rosuvastatin are atorvastatin (Lipitor) and <b>simvastatin</b> (Zocor). However, people can also combine ezetimibe with either <b>simvastatin</b> or atorvastatin and other agents on their own, for somewhat similar augmented response rates. [...] some published information for comparing rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and ezetimibe/simvastatin results is available, {{but many of the}} relevant studies are still in progress.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1994, {{the results}} of a Merck-sponsored study, the Scandinavian <b>Simvastatin</b> Survival Study, were announced. Researchers tested <b>simvastatin,</b> later sold by Merck as Zocor, on 4,444 {{patients}} with high cholesterol and heart disease. After five years, the study concluded the patients saw a 35% reduction in their cholesterol, and their chances of dying of a heart attack were reduced by 42%. In 1995, Zocor and Mevacor both made Merck over US$1 billion. Endo was awarded the 2006 Japan Prize, and the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in 2008. For his [...] "pioneering research into a new class of molecules" [...] for [...] "lowering cholesterol," ...|$|E
2500|$|Bruce Roth, who {{was hired}} by Warner-Lambert as a chemist in 1982, had {{synthesized}} an [...] "experimental compound" [...] codenamed CI 981 – later called atorvastatin. [...] Warner-Lambert management was concerned that atorvastatin was a me-too version of rival Merck & Co.'s orphan drug lovastatin (brand name Mevacor). Mevacor, which was first marketed in 1987, was the industry's first statin and Merck's synthetic version – <b>simvastatin</b> – was in the advanced stages of development. Nevertheless, Bruce Roth and his bosses, Roger Newton and Ronald Cresswell, in 1985 convinced company executives to move the compound into expensive clinical trials. Early results comparing atorvastatin vs. <b>simvastatin</b> demonstrated that atorvastatin was significantly more potent and displayed fewer side effects.|$|E
2500|$|All statins are (metabolized) by the liver, {{which causes}} their low {{systemic}} bioavailability. Lovastatin and <b>simvastatin</b> are administered in their lactone forms, {{which is more}} lipophilic than their free acid forms, and therefore {{they have to be}} activated by hydrolysis to the active anionic carboxylate form. Cytochrome P450(CYP) isoenzymes are involved in the oxidative metabolism of the statins, with CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 isoenzymes being the most dominant. CYP3A4 isoenzyme is the most predominant isoform involved in metabolism of lovastatin, <b>simvastatin,</b> atorvastatin and cerivastatin. CYP2C9 isoenzyme is the most predominant isoform involved in metabolism of Fluvastatin, but CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 isoenzymes also contribute to the metabolism of Fluvastatin. Rosuvastatin is [...] metabolized to a small degree by CYP2C9 {{and to a lesser extent}} by CYP2C19 isoenzymes. Pravastatin is not metabolized by CYP isoenzymes to any appreciable extent. The statins that have the ability to be metabolized by multiple CYP isoenzymes may therefore avoid drug accumulation when one of the pathways is inhibited by co-administered drugs.|$|E
2500|$|... {{a number}} of statins are on the market: atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, {{rosuvastatin}} and <b>simvastatin.</b> Several combination preparations of a statin and another agent, such as ezetimibe/simvastatin, are also available. In 2005, sales were estimated at US$18.7billion in the United States. The best-selling statin is atorvastatin, which in 2003 became the best-selling pharmaceutical in history. The manufacturer Pfizer reported sales of US$12.4billion in 2008. Due to patent expirations, several statins became available in 2016 as less expensive generics.|$|E
2500|$|Combinations of statins, niacin and {{intestinal}} cholesterol absorption-inhibiting supplements (ezetimibe and others, {{and to a}} much {{lesser extent}} fibrates) {{have been the most}} successful in changing common but sub-optimal lipoprotein patterns and group outcomes. In the many secondary prevention and several primary prevention trials, several classes of lipoprotein-expression-altering (less correctly termed [...] "cholesterol-lowering") agents have consistently reduced not only heart attack, stroke and hospitalization but also all-cause mortality rates. The first of the large secondary prevention comparative statin/placebo treatment trials was the Scandinavian <b>Simvastatin</b> Survival Study (4S) with over fifteen more studies extending through to the more recent ASTEROID trial published in 2006. The first primary prevention comparative treatment trial was AFCAPS/TexCAPS with multiple later comparative statin/placebo treatment trials including EXCEL, ASCOT and SPARCL. While the statin trials have all been clearly favorable for improved human outcomes, only ASTEROID and SATURN showed evidence of atherosclerotic regression (slight). Both human and animal trials that showed evidence of disease regression used more aggressive combination agent treatment strategies, which nearly always included niacin.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, Merck & Co’s <b>simvastatin</b> was {{approved}} as an HMG-COA inhibitor {{to lower the}} levels of LDL cholesterol. In 2006, Merck & Co’s sitagliptin {{was approved}} by the FDA for treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2. The patent for <b>simvastatin</b> expired in 2006 and many companies began to create a generic product of <b>simvastatin.</b> By creating a combined-dosage form of <b>simvastatin</b> and sitagliptin, Merck was able to increase their sales of <b>simvastatin</b> while meeting the need of patients who take both <b>simvastatin</b> and sitagliptin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Simvastatin</b> is {{contraindicated}} with pregnancy, breastfeeding, {{and liver}} disease. Pregnancy must be avoided while on <b>simvastatin</b> due to potentially severe birth defects.

50|$|The {{ratio of}} Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for Polycap and {{reference}} drugs was within 80-125% for atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, ramipril, ramiprilat and dose normalized salicylic acid. However, for <b>simvastatin</b> the point estimate of Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for Ln-transformed data {{were significantly lower}} (~25%) and for its active metabolite, <b>simvastatin</b> acid, it was significantly higher (~60%). Thus, the increased bioavailability of active <b>simvastatin</b> acid compensated {{for the loss of}} bioavailability of <b>simvastatin</b> alone.
