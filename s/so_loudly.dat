The people, attracted by the scream, show up and start singing, giving Gabriel hope. He finds his ability to sing and brings Faythe back to life ("Hymn of a Thousand Voices"). Nafaryus, realising what he has done, decides to end the conflict with Gabriel and shuts down the NOMACS for good. Daryus is forgiven for his actions, and Gabriel and Faythe raise Xander as a family ("Our New World"). Nafaryus promises to govern the empire as a fair leader in a new world where music is appreciated again ("Astonishing").|$|E
5|$|The Montalto faction {{transferred}} {{their support}} to Medici on 1 April, securing his election. Joyeuse had been seeking Medici's election throughout the conclave, and {{had managed to}} secure the support of Montalto for his candidate. Montalto was allied with the Spanish and had previously backed Tolomeo Gallio. After Medici's election, Avila revealed that Philip III had excluded Medici as well, and protested <b>so</b> <b>loudly</b> {{that he could be}} heard on the street. The cardinals who had elected Medici answered that protesting the election of a candidate was useless once the person was elected pope. Upon his election, Medici took the name Leo XI in honour of his great-uncle Leo X. His election made Leo the fourth cardinal to be elected pope that had been created by Sixtus V in his consistory in 1583.|$|E

25|$|The {{classical}} rabbinical literature {{argues that}} Judah reacted violently {{to the threat}} against Benjamin, shouting <b>so</b> <b>loudly</b> that Hushim, who was then in Canaan, was able to hear Judah ask him to travel to Egypt, to help Judah destroy it; some sources have Judah angrily picking up an extremely heavy stone (400 shekels in weight), throwing it into the air, then grinding it to dust with his feet once it had landed. These rabbinical sources argue that Judah had Naphtali enumerate the districts of Egypt, and after finding out that there were 12 (historically, there were actually 20 in Lower Egypt and 22 in Upper Egypt), he decided to destroy three himself, and have his brothers destroy one of the remaining districts each; the threat of destroying Egypt was, according to these sources, what really motivated Joseph to reveal himself to his brothers.|$|E
25|$|Ganga is a consort to {{all three}} major male deities of Hinduism. As Brahma's partner she always travels {{with him in the}} form of water in his kamandalu (water-pot). She is also Vishnu's consort. She emanates from his foot as Vishnupadi in the avatarana story, and is also, with Lakshmi, his wife. In one popular story, envious of being outdone by each other, the wives begin to quarrel. While Lakshmi {{attempts}} to mediate the quarrel, Ganga and Sarasvati heap misfortune on each other. They curse each other to become rivers, and to carry within them, by washing, the sins of their human worshippers. Soon their husband, Vishnu, arrives and decides to calm the situation by separating the goddesses. He orders Sarasvati to become the wife of Brahma, Ganga to become the wife of Shiva, and Lakshmi, as the blameless conciliator, to remain as his own wife. Ganga and Sarasvati, however, are so distraught at this dispensation, and wail <b>so</b> <b>loudly,</b> that Vishnu is forced to take back his words. Consequently, in their lives as rivers they are still thought to be with him.|$|E
25|$|There {{had been}} rumours after the Broadway meeting of January 1648, that Levellers were conspiring with Royalists to {{overthrow}} the new republic. During the Oxford mutiny this was confirmed when Parliament acquired {{a letter from a}} Royalist prisoner in the Tower of London to Lord Cottington, an advisor in exile with Charles II in France, which suggested that the Royalists should finance the Levellers, as a method by which Charles could be restored to the throne. Armed with this evidence parliament published a long declaration against the Levellers and passed a motion to try Lilburne for high treason, using a court similar to that which had tried Charles I. Like the trial of the King sentence would be passed by appointed commissioners (forty for Lilburne's trial), but unlike the King (who had no peers) a jury of 12 would decide on Lilburne's guilt or innocence. The trial took place in the London Guildhall. It started on 24 October 1649, and lasted two days. When the jury found him not guilty, the public shouted their approval <b>so</b> <b>loudly</b> and for so long that it was another half an hour before the proceedings could be formally closed.|$|E

25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke <b>so</b> <b>loudly</b> that as we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E

500|$|The {{scheduling}} problems {{meant that}} the show {{did not get the}} momentum to achieve high viewing figures. Moffat jokes that [...] "the eight people who saw it were very happy indeed". However, as Bathurst observes, [...] "there's an underground of people who like it". The show rated highly on the Appreciation Index, meaning that viewers thought very highly of the programme. Bathurst says that drunks on the London Underground tell him in detail the plot of their favourite episode. The cast claim that the programme has a timeless, universal appeal as there are no time-specific references apart from the typewriter {{and the size of the}} mobile telephones. Gillies says that her accountant watches it to cheer himself up, while Bathurst recalls that a friend cheered <b>so</b> <b>loudly</b> when Mark pushes avocado into Trevor's face in the third episode that he woke his son.|$|E
500|$|Despite these {{regional}} differences, Hampton credits Illmatic {{with providing}} a common artistic ground for rappers on the West Coast and East Coast rap scenes. In the 2009 essay [...] "Born Alone, Die Alone," [...] she recounts the album's impact on West Coast artist, Tupac Shakur. While {{working as a}} journalist for The Source in 1994, Hampton covered three court cases involving Tupac. Around this time, she received an advance-copy of Illmatic and immediately dubbed a cassette version for Tupac, who became [...] "an instant convert" [...] of the album. The next day, she writes, Tupac [...] "arrived in his assigned courtroom blasting Illmatic <b>so</b> <b>loudly</b> that the bailiff yelled at him {{to turn it off}} before the judge took his seat on the bench." [...] In her essay, Hampton implies that Nas' lyricism might have influenced Tupac's acclaimed album, Me Against the World, which was recorded that same year.|$|E

Michelle Obama {{had returned to}} the White House on the morning of November 15, going to sleep shortly after arriving. An usher went to check on her later that day and began talking about the shooting, assuming she already knew about the incident. According to Leonnig, the first lady was [...] "furious", wondering why the director of the Secret Service, Mark J. Sullivan, who had accompanied her on her flight back to Washington, had not told her about it. Leonnig also stated that Sullivan was subsequently summoned to a meeting with the first lady, during which she [...] raised her voice <b>so</b> <b>loudly</b> she could be heard through the closed door. Sullivan disputes this report, though he declined to give any details regarding the conversation. A detailed inspection of the White House for evidence or damage and interviews with key witnesses began later that afternoon. Leonnig also stated that president Obama was angered over the flawed response and the failure to notify the first lady. According to one presidential aide, [...] "the shit really hit the fan" [...] when Obama returned from his travels five days later.|$|E

These training routines sometimes include TR 8, which involves the individual commanding an ashtray to [...] "stand up" [...] and [...] "sit down", and thanking it for doing <b>so,</b> as <b>loudly</b> as they can.

500|$|Lloyd's biographer Midge Gillies defines 1891 {{as being}} the year that she officially [...] "made it" [...] thanks to a {{catalogue}} of hit songs and major success in the halls and pantomime. When she appeared at the Oxford music hall in June, the audience cheered <b>so</b> <b>loudly</b> for her return that the following act could not be heard; The Era called her [...] "the favourite of the hour". During the summer months, she toured North England, including Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester. [...] At the last she stayed an extra six nights due to popular demand, which caused her to cancel a trip to Paris. [...] The 1892 pantomime was Little Bo Peep; or, Little Red Riding Hood and Hop O' My Thumb, in which she played Little Red Riding Hood. [...] The production was five hours long and culminated with the show's harlequinade. During one scene, her improvisational skills caused some scandal when {{she got out of}} bed to pray, but instead reached for a chamber pot. The stunt angered Harris, who ordered her not to do it again or risk immediate dismissal. Max Beerbohm, who was in a later audience, said [...] "Isn't Marie Lloyd charming and sweet in the pantomime? [...] I think of little besides her." [...] On 12 January 1892, Lloyd and Courtenay brawled drunkenly in her Drury Lane dressing room after an evening's performance of Little Bo-Peep. [...] Courtenay pulled a decorative sword off the wall and threatened to cut her throat; she escaped from the room with minor bruises and reported the incident to the Bow Street police station. In early 1893, she travelled to Wolverhampton where she starred as Flossie in another unsuccessful piece called The A.B.C Girl; or, Flossie the Frivolous, which, according to MacQueen-Pope, [...] "ended the Queen of Comedy's career as an actress".|$|E

[...] (Wearing a white baseball cap at Columbine was a tradition among sports team members, typically jocks.) When no one stood up in response, Harris said, [...] "Fine, I'll start shooting anyway!" [...] He fired his shotgun twice at a desk, not knowing that a student named Evan Todd was hiding beneath it. Todd was hit by wood splinters but was not seriously injured.|$|E

Collaring him, she suspended him through their second-story window, [...] "making him [...] "screa <b>so</b> <b>loudly</b> that the neighbors all rushed out and were quite horrified at the spectacle of my mother dangling me out the window".

5000|$|Much of {{the album}} was similar in style to early Celtic Frost, {{particularly}} the songs [...] "Triumphant Gleam", [...] "The Hordes of Nebulah" [...] and [...] "Beholding the Throne of Might". However, the production continued in a similar [...] "raw" [...] vein to that of Transilvanian Hunger (1994). The vocals were mixed <b>loudly</b> <b>so</b> that the instruments seemed to get quieter during vocal parts, {{as if they were}} side-chained.

There is a local oral tradition suggestive of a folk memory of earlier large eruptions. An ancient legend tells of Bacobaco, a terrible spirit of the sea, who could metamorphose into a huge turtle and throw fire from his mouth. In the legend, when being chased by the spirit hunters, Bacobaco flees to the mountain and digs a great hole in its summit showering the surrounding land with rock, mud, dust and fire for three days; howling <b>so</b> <b>loudly</b> that the earth shakes.|$|E
2500|$|McKean {{quickly became}} one of the most {{influential}} members of the Stamp Act Congress. He was on the committee that drew the memorial to Parliament, and with John Rutledge and Philip Livingston, revised its proceedings. On the last day of its session, when the business session ended, Timothy Ruggles, the president of the body, and a few other more cautious members, refused to sign the memorial of rights and grievances. McKean arose and addressing the chair insisted that the president give his reasons for his refusal. After refusing at first, Ruggles remarked, [...] "it was against his conscience." [...] McKean then disputed his use of the word [...] "conscience" [...] <b>so</b> <b>loudly</b> and so long that a challenge was given by Ruggles and accepted in the presence of the congress. However, Ruggles left the next morning at daybreak, so that the duel did not take place.|$|E
