5|$|McKinley's {{original}} vice president, Garret Hobart, {{had died}} in 1899, and McKinley left {{the choice of a}} running mate to the 1900 Republican National Convention. In advance of the convention, New York's Republican political boss, Senator Thomas C.

5|$|By late 2004, Brokaw {{had retired}} from his {{anchoring}} duties at NBC, ceding the reins to Brian Williams; Rather planned {{to step down}} in March 2005. Jennings and ABC <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to gain viewers, and initiated a publicity blitz touting the anchor's foreign reporting experience. However, despite having almost always reported {{from the scene of}} any major news story, Jennings was sidelined by an upper respiratory infection in late December 2004; he was forced to anchor from New York during the aftermath of the Asian tsunami, while his competitors traveled to the region. For Jennings, the situation was agonizing.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 Kujau {{visited his}} family in East Germany and {{discovered}} {{that many of the}} locals held Nazi memorabilia, contrary to the laws of the communist government. He <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to buy the material cheaply on the black market, and make a profit in the West, where the increasing demand among Stuttgart collectors was raising memorabilia prices up to ten times the amount he would pay. The trade was illegal in East Germany, and the export of what were deemed items of cultural heritage was banned. Among the items smuggled out of East Germany were weapons.|$|E
5|$|Production {{started in}} October 1953, {{but had to}} be halted within weeks when Masina dislocated her ankle during the convent scene with Quinn.

5|$|After the {{conflict}} ended, Themistocles continued his pre-eminence among Athenian politicians. However, he aroused the hostility of Sparta by ordering the re-fortification of Athens, and his perceived arrogance began to alienate {{him from the}} Athenians. In 472 or 471BC, he was ostracised, and went into exile in Argos. The Spartans now <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to destroy Themistocles, and implicated him in the alleged treasonous plot of 478 BC of their own general Pausanias. Themistocles thus fled from Greece. Alexander I of Macedon (reigned 498-454 BC) temporarily gave him sanctuary at Pydna before he traveled to Asia Minor, where he entered {{the service of the}} Persian king Artaxerxes I (reigned 465-424 BC). He was made governor of Magnesia, and lived there {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|By late 1944, rocket {{development}} and testing work began to taper off, and production models started {{to reach the}} Navy and USAAF in quantity. The director of the OSRD, Vannevar Bush <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{to use some of}} the expertise at Caltech on another secret wartime project he was involved with, the Manhattan Project. Bush arranged for Charles C. Lauritsen, the head of the rocket team at Caltech, to visit the Los Alamos Laboratory, and meet with the project director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the laboratory director, Robert Oppenheimer, and senior scientists at the Los Alamos laboratory. Oppenheimer and Lauritsen knew each other well, as Oppenheimer had worked at Caltech before the war. In addition to its scientists, Caltech also possessed an experienced procurement team, headed by Trevor Gardner. This group worked closely with its counterpart at Los Alamos, which was headed by Lieutenant Colonel Robert W. Lockridge.|$|E
5|$|In {{early summer}} 960, Sayf al-Dawla <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to reverse his recent {{setbacks}} and re-establish his position: the best {{troops of the}} Byzantine army, and the Domestic Nikephoros Phokas in person, departed the eastern front for an expedition against the Emirate of Crete. The task of confronting the Hamdanid emir fell on Leo Phokas, who according to the Byzantine chroniclers had been appointed as Domestic of the West following the accession of Romanos II in November 959 (with Nikephoros being named Domestic of the East) and had just defeated a Magyar raid into Thrace in a daring night attack on their camp. The 11th-century Christian Arab chronicler Yahya of Antioch, however, reports that Leo had been appointed Domestic of the East, {{and that he had}} remained on the eastern front throughout 959–960, leading raids into the Hamdanid domains up until the invasion of Sayf al-Dawla.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} {{international}} events surrounding Henry during the 1160s was the Becket controversy. When the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theobald of Bec, died in 1161 Henry <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to reassert his rights over the church in England. Henry appointed Thomas Becket, his English Chancellor, as archbishop in 1162, probably believing that Becket, {{in addition to being}} an old friend, would be politically weakened within the Church because of his former role as Chancellor, and would therefore have to rely on Henry's support. Both Matilda and Eleanor appear to have had doubts about the appointment, but Henry continued regardless. His plan did not have the desired result, however, as Becket promptly changed his lifestyle, abandoned his links to the King and portrayed himself as a staunch protector of church rights.|$|E
5|$|When Miranda {{attacked}} that morning, Coburg's {{first reaction}} was to draw substantial troops from his center to reinforce his right flank. Initially, Archduke Charles' men were driven back to Dorsmael but then they {{held on to the}} village. The French Reserve captured Leau and threatened Halle but was soon thrown back. The main fighting occurred between 3:00 and 6:00 PM when Miaczinski's column seized Dorsmael but counterattacks drove his soldiers out. Other attacks withered {{in the face of the}} strong Coalition defenses. Charles <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> and hurled his cavalry on the tired French soldiers. The Left Wing became so demoralized that its troops were driven back to Tienen before Miranda could rally them. When Dumouriez heard of the defeat of Miranda's wing on the morning of the 19th he was forced to order a retreat.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, {{the chaos}} of the English Civil War gave Claiborne another {{opportunity}} to reclaim Kent Island. The Calverts, who had received such constant support from the King, in turn supported the monarchy during {{the early stages of the}} parliamentary crisis. Claiborne found a new ally in Richard Ingle, a pro-Parliament Puritan merchant whose ships had been seized by the Catholic authorities in Maryland in response to a royal decree against Parliament. Claiborne and Ingle <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for revenge using the Parliamentary dispute as political cover, and in 1644 Claiborne seized Kent Island while Ingle took over St. Mary's. Both used religion as a tool to gain popular support, arguing that the Catholic Calverts could not be trusted. By 1646, however, Governor Leonard Calvert had retaken both St. Mary's and Kent Island with support from Governor Berkeley of Virginia, and, after Leonard Calvert died in 1648, Cecil Calvert appointed a pro-Parliament Protestant to take over as governor. The rebellion and its religious overtones was one of the factors that led to passage of the landmark Maryland Toleration Act of 1649, which declared religious tolerance for Catholics and Protestants in Maryland.|$|E

5|$|Ares– The former God of War {{and main}} {{antagonist}} of God of War. Ares captured Kratos' brother Deimos {{and had him}} imprisoned and tortured due to a misinterpreted prophecy, and later chose Kratos as his champion during a successful wager with other Olympian Gods in the God of War comic series. Early on, Ares wanted to overthrow Zeus and entered into an alliance with the Furies to help him do so. Years later, as he deemed his own son Orkos unworthy, Ares <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to create a warrior to help him. During a battle, Kratos called on the God of War, and pledged his life in servitude if Ares spared him from his foes and provided the power to destroy them. Ares granted Kratos' wish and empowered his new servant with the Blades of Chaos. A victorious Kratos eventually renounced his servitude to Ares when the god tricked Kratos into accidentally killing his own wife and child. In God of War, while Ares waged war on the city of Athens, Kratos was tasked by Athena to find Pandora's Box, an artifact capable of destroying Ares. Ultimately successful, Kratos ascended to Mount Olympus and replaced Ares as the new God of War. In Ascensions multiplayer mode, Ares {{is one of the}} four gods that players can pledge their allegiance to. The character was voiced by Steven Blum in God of War, Ghost of Sparta, and Ascension. Fred Tatasciore provided Ares' voice in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E
5|$|As a junior, Watts {{played in}} the forward line as a strong-marking tall and was an {{accurate}} shot on goal. Regarded as an incredibly quick player for his height, especially over the first twenty metres, his speed and athleticism saw him dominate in the forward line as a junior. After struggling to replicate his form from the juniors in the AFL, he was trialled as a defender in 2011 by then senior-coach, Dean Bailey, playing primarily as the loose man in defence. Bailey intended on using him as both a defender and forward; he recognised Watts {{would not be the}} main key forward at the club, which was intended when he was drafted, but when playing in the forward line, he would instead be used as a floating forward. He played a new role in 2012 under Mark Neeld in defence, where he was highly praised for his ability to read the play and take intercept marks. He played in defence for the duration of Neeld's tenure, until Neeld was sacked and replaced by Neil Craig in the middle of 2013 with Craig electing to return Watts to the forward line. After playing in the forward line and in defence, incoming coach in 2014, Paul Roos, <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for Watts to play in the midfield due to his body size and elite kicking, in addition to the club needing an influx of midfielders. After the desperate need for midfielders dissipated, Watts returned to a half-forward role in the middle of 2014; he played as a half-forward throughout Roos' coaching term and was used as a back-up ruckman in 2016.|$|E
