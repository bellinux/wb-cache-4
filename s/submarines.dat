5|$|As per the {{operation}} plan, the five mother <b>submarines</b> waited off Port Hacking on the nights of 1 and 2 June for the midget <b>submarines</b> to return. FRUMEL picked up wireless traffic between the five <b>submarines,</b> leading the RAAF to task three Lockheed Hudsons and two Bristol Beauforts with finding {{the source of}} the communications. They were unsuccessful. On 3 June, Sasaki abandoned hope of recovering the midget <b>submarines,</b> and the <b>submarines</b> dispersed on their secondary missions.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the raid, the five Japanese fleet <b>submarines</b> {{that carried the}} midget <b>submarines</b> to Australia embarked on a campaign to disrupt merchant shipping in eastern Australian waters. Over the next month, the <b>submarines</b> attacked at least seven merchant vessels, sinking three ships and killing 50 sailors. During this period, between midnight and 02:30 on 8 June, two of the <b>submarines</b> bombarded the ports of Sydney and Newcastle.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, the Department of Defence {{revealed}} that the generators {{in five of the}} <b>submarines</b> were flawed and had to be replaced.

5|$|In the Atlantic, the Allies waged a long {{battle with}} German <b>submarines</b> which was termed the Battle of the Atlantic. Navy {{aircraft}} flew from bases in Greenland and Iceland to hunt <b>submarines,</b> {{and hundreds of}} escort carriers and destroyer escorts were built which were specifically designed to protect merchant convoys. In the Pacific, in an ironic twist, the U.S. <b>submarines</b> fought against Japanese shipping in {{a mirror image of}} the Atlantic, with U.S. <b>submarines</b> hunting Japanese merchant ships. At {{the end of the war}} the U.S. had 260 <b>submarines</b> in commission. It had lost 52 <b>submarines</b> during the war, 36 in actions in the Pacific. <b>Submarines</b> effectively destroyed the Japanese merchant fleet by January 1945 and choked off Japan's oil supply.|$|E

5|$|The {{other five}} <b>submarines</b> were {{scheduled}} for completion at 12-month intervals. However, {{the series of}} defects and problems encountered during sea trials of the <b>submarines</b> (particularly Collins) resulted in the repeated diversion of resources from those still under construction, adding to delays. Consequently, delivery of the <b>submarines</b> ran significantly behind schedule; <b>submarines</b> were presented to the RAN between 21and 41months late, and the entire class was not cleared for full operational service until March 2004, {{a year after the}} last boat was commissioned. These delays forced the RAN to keep several Oberon-class <b>submarines</b> and the submarine base HMAS Platypus in service beyond their planned decommissioning dates.|$|E

5|$|Triton {{was to be}} {{the lead}} ship of a {{proposed}} class of nuclear-powered radar picket <b>submarines.</b> A December 1955 long-range naval planning report envisioned five carrier strike groups, each supported by two radar picket <b>submarines.</b> The total force included two non-nuclear Sailfish class <b>submarines</b> and eight nuclear <b>submarines.</b> With construction costs for Triton escalating, this long-range requirement was revised in 1957 to provide four nuclear-powered radar picket <b>submarines</b> for a single nuclear-powered carrier group, with the four remaining conventionally powered carrier groups supported by two diesel-electric radar picket <b>submarines</b> each.|$|E
5|$|All Type IXA <b>submarines</b> {{were ordered}} by the Kriegsmarine between 29 July 1936 and 21 November 1936 as part of Plan Z and the overall German plan of re-armament in {{violation}} of the Treaty of Versailles. The design of the IXA <b>submarines</b> was derived from the German Type IA submarine. All contracts for the construction of the <b>submarines</b> were awarded to DeSchiMAG AG Weser, Bremen. The first U-boat to be laid down in the Bremen ship yards was U-37, whose keel was laid down on 15 March 1937. The last U-boat to be laid down was , whose construction began on 15 September 1937. By November 1939, all eight <b>submarines</b> had been fully constructed and commissioned into the Kriegsmarine.|$|E
5|$|Attacks on the German <b>submarines</b> {{continued}} {{for the next}} six days. On the morning of 18 July a German reconnaissance aircraft spotted the Home Fleet, but the German Naval Command Norway assessed that it was heading north-east to launch another attack. Accordingly, Group Trutz was ordered to sail north, and four more <b>submarines</b> sortied from Narvik to guard the approaches to Alten and Vest fjords. In the evening , one of the four boats that had sailed from Narvik, was attacked twice by Liberators; she shot down the first attacker but was damaged by the second and had to return to port. U-716 also suffered severe damage from a Liberator attack at 19:15 on 18 July but managed to return to Hammerfest. At about 23:00 that day U-716 was seriously damaged by a Short Sunderland but also survived. Three other <b>submarines</b> were attacked on 20 July but only one suffered any damage. Following these actions the commander of <b>submarines</b> in the Norway area decided to dissolve Group Trutz as it was too vulnerable to air attack; all but four of the surviving <b>submarines</b> returned to port and the remaining boats were ordered to sail north so that they were out of range of the British aircraft. The final attack on the <b>submarines</b> of the former Group Trutz was made on 23 July when a No. 330 Squadron Sunderland damaged U-992 near Vestfjord.|$|E

50|$|The embryo of the 1st <b>Submarine</b> Flotilla {{was formed}} in 1904, when the Swedish Navy was {{supplied}} with its first <b>submarine,</b> Hajen, and the <b>submarine</b> force was formed. In 1918 the <b>submarine</b> force was included as the 1st <b>Submarine</b> Division (1. undervattensbåtsdivisionen) in the Coastal Fleet (Kustflottan). In 1934, the <b>submarine</b> force had been organized as the <b>Submarine</b> Department (Ubåtsavdelningen) with three included divisions. In 1951, the unit was assigned its current name, and {{was part of the}} Coastal Fleet as the 1st <b>Submarine</b> Flotilla. During the 1970s, the Navy Diving School (Flottans dykarskola) was added to the flotilla, which later formed the Diving Division (Dykdivisionen), which included <b>submarine</b> rescue ships.|$|R
5|$|HMS Swordfish was {{developed}} to meet a requirement of Royal Navy's Submarine Committee for a large submarine capable of operating with the fleet at a surfaced speed of 20 knots. Most of the earlier British <b>submarines</b> had been single-hulled vessels built by Vickers, and the Navy was interested in evaluating other designs. Captain Roger Keyes, Inspecting Captain of <b>Submarines,</b> had previously served as naval attaché in Italy and had kept abreast of Italian submarine developments, which notably included double-hulled <b>submarines</b> designed by Cesare Laurenti of Fiat-San Giorgio. Three boats of the S class were ordered first and Laurenti was invited to submit a design to meet the RN requirement.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Christie {{was given}} command of Submarine Division 15, {{consisting}} of all six Salmon-class <b>submarines.</b> By 1941, Germany and the United Kingdom {{were engaged in}} the Battle of the Atlantic. Although the United States was neutral, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the U.S. Atlantic Fleet to enforce the Neutrality Patrol to assist UK-bound convoys. As part of secret agreements with Britain, the United States agreed to provide the former with <b>submarines</b> under Royal Navy control, should America enter the conflict. Admiral Richard S. Edwards, Commander, <b>Submarines,</b> Atlantic Fleet (ComSubLant), selected the now Captain Christie as tactical commander for the proposed submarine force in British waters. Christie wanted the new Tambor-class <b>submarines</b> to be assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, but was overruled by Admiral Harold R. Stark, who selected the older S and Barracuda classes instead. As war seemed increasingly likely {{toward the end of}} 1941, Christie placed his boats on full war footing.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 and 2009, {{personnel}} shortages {{reduced the}} number of <b>submarines</b> able to be deployed to three; the maintenance cycles of Sheean, Rankin, and Dechaineux, and problems with Collins and Waller further reducing this to one, Farncomb, in mid-2009. Farncomb was docked for repair after a generator malfunction in February 2010, by which point Collins and Waller were active (the former on limited duties because of defects), and Dechaineux was slated to re-enter service by May 2010. Workforce shortages and malfunctions on other <b>submarines</b> during the preceding two years impacted heavily on the maintenance of Sheean and Rankin, with RAN and ASC officials predicting {{that they will not be}} active until 2012 and 2013, respectively. In June 2011, The Australian newspaper claimed despite two <b>submarines</b> (Waller and Dechaineux) designated as operational, neither was in sailable condition. The initial findings from the Coles Review revealed significant, systemic problems with the <b>submarines</b> and noted the need for their management to be reformed. A 2014 statement by Vice Admiral Ray Griggs indicated that up to four <b>submarines</b> had been operational on most occasions since 2012.|$|E

5|$|In late May {{and early}} June 1942, during World War II, <b>submarines</b> {{belonging}} to the Imperial Japanese Navy {{made a series of}} attacks on the cities of Sydney and Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia. On the night of 31 May – 1 June, three Ko-hyoteki-class midget <b>submarines,</b> each with a two-member crew, entered Sydney Harbour, avoided the partially constructed Sydney Harbour anti-submarine boom net, and attempted to sink Allied warships. Two of the midget <b>submarines</b> were detected and attacked before they could successfully engage any Allied vessels, and the crews scuttled their boats and killed themselves. These <b>submarines</b> were later recovered by the Allies. The third submarine attempted to torpedo the heavy cruiser , but instead sank the converted ferry HMAS Kuttabul, killing 21 sailors. This midget submarine's fate was unknown until 2006, when amateur scuba divers discovered the wreck off Sydney's northern beaches.|$|E
