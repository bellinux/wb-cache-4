In the present research we hypothesized that low academic achievement is accompanied by a low ‘strategic coherence’, i. e. by a poor capacity to use the strategies which are considered the most effective to study a text. Study 1 found that low achievement under-graduates have lower <b>strategic</b> <b>coherence</b> than high achievers. Study 2 demonstrated that the less coherent students have a poor study method and low scholastic performance.

Empirical studies {{on the question of whether}} the motivation for establishing a production site abroad is indeed consistent with {{the competitive}} strategy of companies are still lacking and do present a scientific blank. Therefore, in a representative survey of 1630 companies of the German manufacturing industry, the correlation between the driving factors of a production location abroad and the competitive strategy, as well as the impact on the productivity of the home business, have been empirically examined. The findings show that there is no conclusive, statistic proof for a correlation of the factors mentioned above. But the <b>strategic</b> <b>coherence</b> between the driving factors for a production location abroad and the competitive strategy does indeed influence significantly the productivity of the German location...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the judgements of efficacy and use and their correspondence (strategic consistency) of learning strategies in students from 11 to 14 years old and the relationship between these judgements with scholastic achievements. We presented to a sample of 324 students (VI,VII and VIII) two Strategies Questionnaires, one measuring the perceived effectiveness and the other measuring the use of strategies that are part of a battery recently devised in Italy (Cornoldi,De Beni, Zamperlin and Meneghetti, 2005). Results showed that students generally rated the valid strategies to be more effective than the less valid strategies and the judgements of efficacy was more highly than the judgements of use. Furthermore, the high achievers (measured by scholastic performance) had more <b>strategic</b> <b>coherence</b> in comparison with the other students (low and medium achievers).

Changes in the sunspot numbers precede changes in the temperatures by more than two years as suggested by the wavelet phase differences. This leading position of the sun activity is stable in time as well. However, the relationship has been disturbed by increasing $CO_ 2 $ emissions since 1960 s. Without controlling for the effect of possible global warming, or more precisely the positive connection between increasing $CO_ 2 $ emissions and the global temperatures, the findings would have been quite different.

40|$|We theorize that {{organizations}} {{that are able to}} use stories and examples to explain their strategy and offer a flexible guide to discretionary employee behaviors use them in what can be termed a fractal fashion. The thesis is based on the idea of how strategic logic can be communicated and how it can be reiter-ated to lead to <b>strategic</b> <b>coherence</b> across different levels of analysis in organizations. The parallels of a nonlinear, rein-forcing process that is based on iteration inspired us to draw on complexity theory and fractal processes to understand the generation of <b>strategic</b> <b>coherence.</b> We present the case of a suc-cessful nonprofit organization where it appears that such a fractal use of stories occurred. AS COMPLEXITY THEORY is extended to the organizational setting,several authors have used it loosely in a metaphoric sense(McKelvey, 1999; Brown and Eisenhardt, 1997), while others have used the conceptual underpinnings of nonlinearity for simula-tions that can help us understand the social creation of competen-cies (Dooley and Van de Ven, 1999; Black, King, and Oliver, 2004). Still others have attempted to link complexity theories more directly to social science research beyond the general metaphoric sense described earlier (Thietart and Forgues, 1995, 1997; Black, Fabian, and Hinrichs, 2005). In this article, we follow in this latter approach and offer an empirical effort to illustrate how complexity types of phenomena may reveal themselves in a nonprofit organization. Specifically, we apply an understanding of the generation of fractals to help us understand how organizational competences might also be generated...|$|R

However, the five countries –Morocco, Mauritania, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya– display commonalities in their respective strategies: resistance to Western values, and defense policies basically oriented towards domestic stability. The author reviews the relations between France, Spain and Italy, and the Maghreb from a historical viewpoint. The European interest in the political stability of the area can beproved by its willingness to favor economic, social and political development.

30|$|The main {{features}} of GNSI are the following: the asymmetry in density {{and distribution of}} actor inter-linkages; lack of sufficient levels of <b>strategic</b> <b>coherence,</b> organisational performance and externalities; the largely unresponsive Ghana economy to supply- and demand-side signals; and systematical rigidity and inflexibility {{in the face of}} changing conditions (Bartels and Koria 2012). Therefore, the Ghana government’s intent to transform its “factor-driven” economic model into “innovation-driven” industrial development to deliver high levels of productivity, through enhancing competiveness, employment and equitable social and economic development, confronts major hurdles. Relatively high barriers to innovation aligned with poorly configured and inadequately calibrated policy instruments imply incompatibilities in the GNSI that have to be tackled economy- and system-wide, {{as well as at the}} level of actor-specific interventions.|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} of previously defined spike train synchronization indices is undertaken within a stochastic point process framework. The second-order cumulant density (covariance density) {{is shown to}} be common to all the indices. Simulation studies were used to investigate the sampling variability of a single index based on the second-order cumulant. The simulations used a paired motoneurone model and a paired regular spiking cortical neurone model. The sampling variability of spike trains generated under identical conditions from the paired motoneurone model varied from 50 % to 160 % of the estimated value. On theoretical grounds, and {{on the basis of}} simulated data a rate dependence is present in all synchronization indices. The application of coherence and pooled coherence estimates to the issue of synchronization indices is considered. This alternative frequency domain approach allows an arbitrary number of spike train pairs to be evaluated for statistically significant differences, and combined into a single population measure. The pooled <b>coherence</b> <b>framework</b> allows pooled time domain measures to be derived, application of this to the simulated data is illustrated. Data from the cortical neurone model is generated over a wide range of firing rates (1 - 250 spikes/s). The pooled <b>coherence</b> <b>framework</b> correctly characterizes the sampling variability as not significant over this wide operating range. The broader applicability of this approach to multielectrode array data is briefly discussed...|$|R

It is difficult to imagine these commoditized sexual relations without at least contemplating the structural inequalities and patterns of globalization which have enabled the development of sex industries catering to foreign men.
