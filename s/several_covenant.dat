40|$|Social {{protection}} {{is regarded as}} a basic human right guaranteed in <b>several</b> International <b>Covenants</b> and Treaties. The Constitution of Pakistan exclusively stipulates the provision of social security for all citizens of the country. The aim of the study is to explore and evaluate the social protection schemes with regards to its coverage, scope and outreach. The country has number of social security schemes that are being carried out by provincial and federal governments for the welfare of workers like old age benefits, disablement, health and medical facilities. However, these schemes have failed to extend their benefits to home based, part-time, temporary or contract and agricultural workers. This paper attempts to highlight the shortcomings of existing social protection programs that are obstructing their benefit distribution and limiting their outreach. It underlines the challenges faced by the implementing agencies. This paper also suggests some improvements in the structural design of social security mechanism with special focus on the scope, coverage, outreach and effective delivery mechanism. Since, the proper allocation of resources and effective implementation of these schemes can ensure the assistance and welfare of the targeted population...|$|R

40|$|Major Research Paper (Master's), Health, Faculty of Health, School of Health Policy and Management, York UniversityHousehold food {{insecurity}} (HFI) impacts over 1. 1 million households, adversely impact {{the health and}} well-being of individuals and families. Despite the recognition of the right to food by <b>several</b> international <b>covenants,</b> indicating that Canadian governments are obliged to reduce HFI, little has been done by the Canadian government to defend this right. The Canadian Government’s failure to address HFI has resulted in the creation of a number of non-governmental means of managing the problem, which have not been successful in redressing HFI. Furthermore, non-governmental responses may have served to depoliticize the issue of HFI, allowing governments to obfuscate their responsibility in addressing HFI. Four competing approaches of HFI in Canada, nutrition and dietetics, community traditionalism, social determinants of health and political economy complicate solutions by differently conceptualizing and framing the causes and appropriate responses to HFI. I argue that the political economy framework–which views the rise in HFI as precipitating from the skewed distribution of economic and social resources as a result of imbalances in power and influence–best explains the causes of {{food insecurity}} and presents the most effective means of responding to its presence in Canada by acknowledging the larger political and economic structures that shape and precipitate HFI...|$|R

Although Harvest itself is only one-third the size of Earth, its fertile surface serves as the breadbasket for the other colonies. The United Nations Space Command Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) notices strange disappearances of human ships around Harvest, and assumes that Insurrectionists are attacking the vessels. ONI pulls Staff Sergeants Avery Johnson and Nolan Byrne from the frontlines of the civil war to raise a militia to protect Harvest.

Members of the vessel are shocked to discover that their instruments indicates hundreds of thousands of Forerunner relics on the planet of Harvest. A Covenant Unggoy Deacon named Dadab is alarmed when he realizes the Kig-Yar shipmistress intends to steal a portion of the relics for herself, starting with relics leaving the planet on a human cargo ship. The ship is actually a trap set by the humans, with Johnson and Byrne on board. Johnson and Byrne kill <b>several</b> of the <b>Covenant</b> boarding party when they enter the cargo ship, which is later destroyed by a methane explosion. Dadab and his Huragok friend, Lighter than Some, escape the blast and are picked up by a Covenant ship crewed by Jiralhanae.
