40|$|Animal {{health and}} {{production}} management practices used on sheep and beef cattle properties in south-eastern Australia {{have been shown}} in recent surveys, and by consultancy work undertaken by the University of Melbourne Mackinnon Project, to be suboptimal in several areas. Implementation of many advances from research in animal nutrition, production and health in the field has been poor. For example, in sane districts up to 80 % of sheep flocks lamb during autumn and early winter. A change to a spring lambing would enable more sheep to be run on these properties without increasing winter stocking rates. Control of internal parasites on most properties could be improved through the correct timing and use of effective anthelmintics, awareness of the emerging problem of anthelmintic resistance, and planning low risk pastures for weaner <b>sheep.</b> <b>Supplementary</b> feeding could be used more cost-effectively by monitoring the live weight of young sheep over the dry summer and autumn months. Footrot, lice, fleece diseases, blowflies, stocking rate, flock structure, genotype, genetic improvement programs, and poor financial planning cause widespread problems. Each farm presents a unique combination of factors contributing to suboptimal performance, and each farmer has a different attitude to change and risk. Since regional extension methods have generally been unsuccessful in transferring research findings to the farm gate, {{it seems that the}} solution to improving suboptimal performance in the field is to have consultants and advisers working directly with the farmer who is charged for the services provided. The most important limitation at present is the availability of consultants trained to take a whole farm approach...|$|R

Additionally, FlockWatch is intended for use in the field when collecting the animals in an offline mode, together with a Waspmote node connected to the host portable computer and communicating with the other nodes on the <b>sheep.</b> A <b>supplementary</b> effort was invested into coding a sensor node that acts as a listener, intercepts the radio traffic around the flock and serves FlockWatch with data necessary for a real-time visualization...|$|R
40|$|Cahier n ° 2009 - 30 We {{show that}} an {{equilibrium}} always {{exists in the}} Rothschild-Stiglitz insurance market model with adverse selection when insurers can offer either non- participating or participating policies, i. e. insurance contracts which may involve policy dividends or <b>supplementary</b> calls for <b>premium.</b> The equilibrium coincides with the Miyazaki-Spence-Wilson equilibrium, which may involves cross-subsidization between contracts within subgroups of individuals. The paper establishes that participating policies act as an implicit threat that dissuades deviant insurers who aim at attracting low risk individuals only. The model predicts that the mutual corporate form should be prevalent in insurance markets or submarkets where second-best Pareto efficiency requires cross-subsidization between risk types. Stock insurers and mutuals may coexist, with stock insurers offering insurance coverage at actuarial price and mutuals cross-subsidizing risks. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{compromise}} text for {{reform of the}} CAP was distributed at the June EU Agricultural Council meeting. It proposed a number of changes, notably: establishing an earlier start date for modulation; increasing support for young farmers through the rural development regulation; the maintenance of rotational set aside; the exclusion of certain payments from decoupling, including <b>sheep</b> and goat <b>supplementary</b> payments in less favoured and mountain regions, drying aid for cereals, and direct payments in outermost regions. A decision on additional quotas in the dairy sector was deferred as was decoupling pending the full implementation of dairy sector reform. A decision on the {{compromise text}} was deferred to allow member states more time to reflect. Comment: The decision to defer decoupling in the dairy sector until reform is completed, gives a clear indication that for other sectors such as sugar, substantial reform involving price reductions and increased product-specific direct aid payments will have to precede the incorporation of the sector into the single decoupled farm aid payments scheme. The compromise text for reform of the CAP was distributed at the [...] ...|$|R
3000|$|All sheep breeds {{under study}} were {{subjected}} to extensive management system {{with little or no}} supplementary feeding. The animals grazed during the day on crop stubbles and low grade forage on barren land and roadsides for 6 – 8 hours and walked a distance of about 5 – 20 kilometres. They were taken to water source {{two or three times a}} day. During lean period, only Mandya <b>sheep</b> were given <b>supplementary</b> feed like jowar (sorghum), wheat (Triticum), ragi (Eleusine coracana), horse gram (Macrotyloma uniflorum) husk, and leaves of acacia, peepal (Ficus religiosa) and neem (Azadirachta indica). Stall feeding of small flocks was a routine practice carried by Mandya sheep rearers but Bellay <b>sheep</b> rearers provided <b>supplementary</b> feeding to the breeding rams during breeding season only. Mandya and Kenguri sheep flocks were stationary. Most of the Hassan sheep flocks were stationary but some flocks migrated to the adjoining areas during the lean periods of March to June. Bellary sheep migrate to the southern parts of the state (up to 150 – 300 kilometres) during December-August. Some of the Kenguri sheep farmers introduced Bellary rams in their flocks, and admixtures of the two sheep breeds were observed. Adequate health care was provided. Animals were vaccinated against haemorrhagic septicaemia, enterotoxaemia and sheep pox. Anthelmintics were used against the endoparasites. Adult mortality in the four breeds ranged from 5 – 15 %. Flock size of the four breeds varied from small to large. Majority of the Bellary sheep flocks were large to medium sized having average flock size 143 (5 adult males, 106 adult females and 32 young). Most of the Kenguri sheep flocks were medium sized comprising average flock size 87 (4 adult males, 60 adult females and 23 young). Hassan sheep flocks were medium sized consisting average flock size 34 (3 adult males, 23 adult females and 8 young). Flock purity in Bellary, Kenguri and Hassan sheep was approximately 95 percent. Mandya sheep flocks were generally small and in pure form. Average flock size was 16 (1 adult male, 11 adult females and 4 young). At night sheep flocks were housed in a shed thatched with tree branches and crop by-products with a fenced enclosure made of bushes or locally available material or iron wires. The sheep paddocks were either a part of owner’s dwelling or neighbouring to it (Jain et al. 2005 a [...]...|$|R

40|$|Supplementary salt {{is often}} {{added to the}} diet of sheep by {{including}} it in concentrate food, but an alternative is to soak their forage in a weak salt solution, which could prevent the sudden influx of large doses of sodium(Na) to the rumen. An experiment was conducted to compare low and moderate levels of salt in forage with moderate and high levels added to the concentrate. Twenty sheep were housed in individual chambers equipped for faeces and urine collection and offered fresh grass and concentrate, with the salt being added to the grass by soaking in salt water and to the concentrate by direct mixing. The grass for <b>sheep</b> offered the <b>supplementary</b> Na in concentrates and for a control treatment was soaked in water without salt. Grass was offered in two daily meals and was available ad libitum, and concentrates were offered at a restricted level just before the first feeding of grass. Adding salt at the low and moderate levels to the water in which the grass was soaked increased the Na intake from 1. 1 g/day (the control treatment) to 2. 1 and 3. 8 g/day, respectively, and reduced the Mg and Ca contents in the grass, compared with grass soaked in unsalted water. Adding salt to the concentrate at moderate and high levels increased Na intake to 3. 7 and 5. 9 g/day, respectively. Grass dry matter (DM) intakes were increased by adding Na to the concentrates, {{but not to the}} grass, and DM digestibility was increased in all salt supplement treatments except the high level added to the concentrate. The apparent absorption of Na was increased in proportion to the amount of Na added to the diet and that of K was increased at the moderate and high levels. The apparent absorption and retention of Mg and Ca were decreased at the low level of Na supplementation in herbage. It is concluded that the potential benefits of adding salt to the diet, namely increased food intake and digestibility and increased mineral absorption, are dependent on the level of addition and the method of adding it...|$|R
40|$|In {{the words}} of the European Commission, the June 26 th 2003 {{agreement}} on CAP reform will mean that 'in future, the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production'. However 'member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well-defined conditions and within clear limits'. The single farm payment system will enter into force in 2005. However, member states may get a special dispensation to apply it only from 2007. The key elements of the reform package as agreed are:  a single farm payment for EU farmers, independent from production; limited coupled elements may be maintained to avoid abandonment of production; this payment will be linked to respect for environmental, food-safety, animal and plant health and animal-welfare standards, as well as the requirement to keep all farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition ('cross compliance'); a strengthened rural-development policy with more EU money, new measures to promote the quality of the environment and animal welfare, and to help farmers to meet EU production standards starting in 2005; a reduction in direct payments ('modulation') for bigger farms to finance the new rural development policy; a mechanism for financial discipline to ensure that the farm budget fixed until 2013 is not overshot; revisions to the market policy of the CAP involving: asymmetric price cuts in the milk sector; reduction of the monthly increments in the cereals sector by half, (the current intervention price will be maintained);  reforms in the rice, durum wheat, nuts, starch potatoes and dried fodder sectors. The Commission press release provides a detailed summary of how the various reforms will be implemented. This includes an outline of the modifications made to the Commission's original proposals with regard to the single farm payment scheme, where member states can be allowed to maintain up to 25 % of current hectare payments in the arable sector linked to production if this maintains land in production. Alternatively 40 % of the <b>supplementary</b> durum wheat <b>premium</b> may continue to be linked to production. Unlike the Commission's initial proposal there will be no reduction in cereals intervention prices, although the existing seasonal correction payments will be reduced by 50 %. A supplement for durum wheat in traditional durum wheat farming areas will be paid independently of production for which member states may decide to retain 40 % linked to production. A quality premium for durum wheat used in pasta and semolina production to farmers in traditional zones will also be paid. A one-step reduction in the price of rice of 50 % was agreed. This will bring the EU price (€ 150 /tonne) into line with the world market price. Current direct aid payments will be increased from € 25 /tonne to € 177 /tonne. Of this € 102 /tonne {{will be part of the}} single farm aid payment, based on historical rights, while the remainder (€ 75 /tonne) will be paid as a crop-specific aid. Intervention buying will be triggered should market prices fall to € 150 per tonne, with a ceiling of 75, 000 tonnes being set for intervention buying. New tariff items are to be created to accommodate the new rice regime. With regard to the beef sector, member states may decide to retain up to a 100 % of the suckler cow premium and over 40 % of the slaughter premium as a production-linked payment, or 100 % of the slaughter premium or 75 % of the special male premium. In addition for sheep and goats, a maximum of 50 % of the premium can remain linked to production, while drying aid for cereals in the outermost regions of the EU may remain linked to production. The dairy sector will only be incorporated into the single farm payment from 2008 when the process of reform has been fully implemented. The reformed dairy quota regime will remain in place until 2014 / 15. The intervention prices for butter will decrease by 25 % over four years which is an additional price cut of 10 % compared to those agreed in 2000. There will be a reduction in skimmed milk powder prices of 15 % over three years in line with the Agenda 2000 agreement. Intervention buying for butter will be suspended above a limit of 70, 000 tonnes in 2004, with this declining to 30, 000 tonnes by 2007. Compensation payments will rise from € 11. 81 per tonne in 2004 to € 23. 65 in 2005 and € 35. 5 per tonne in 2006. In addition member states may make additional payments equivalent to 10 % of the sum of the single farm aid payment to encourage specific types of farming. With regard to funds generated by 'modulation' (that is the progressive reduction of payments to larger farms) 1 % will remain in the member states where the money is raised. The remainder will be allocated to member states according to: agricultural area; agricultural employment; GDP per capita, purchasing power. This being said every member state will receive at least 80 % of the funds generated from modulation in its territory. Proposals for reform of the olive oil, tobacco and cotton regimes will be tabled in autumn 2003. Comment: The prior implementation of reform in the dairy sector, involving substantial price reductions, in advance of incorporation into the single farm payment scheme, gives an indication of the likely trajectory for reform in the sugar sector, a sector of vital importance to a number of ACP economies. The impact this will have on the value of ACP sugar preferences (quite independent of the outcome of the Brazilian and Australian WTO challenge to the EU's 'C' export arrangements) will need to be taken into account in the on-going EPA negotiations; possibly through the negotiation of 'compensatory trade measures' explicitly linked to the erosion of the value of trade preferences as a result of the implementation of CAP reform. In the rice sector the compromise reform includes a specific reference to traditional rice suppliers stating 'the Commission will also take into account the interests of developing countries, including those traditional suppliers, as well as the implementation of the EBA regulation', it remains to be seen what this will mean in practice for traditional ACP suppliers such as Surinam and Guyana. The major change with regard to modulation which keeps the vast majority of these funds for deployment in support of rural development means that there will be little scope created for the financing of further reform. This could serve to defer substantive reform of the EU sugar regime. In {{the words of}} the European Commission, the June 26 th 2003 agreement on CAP [...] ...|$|R
