25|$|Testosterone is {{also used}} as a {{medication}} to treat male hypogonadism and certain types of breast cancer. Since testosterone levels gradually decrease as men age, <b>synthetic</b> <b>testosterone</b> is sometimes prescribed to older men to counteract this deficiency.|$|E
25|$|A {{urine sample}} taken from Landis {{immediately}} after his Stage 17 win has twice {{tested positive for}} banned <b>synthetic</b> <b>testosterone</b> {{as well as a}} ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone nearly three times the limit allowed by World Anti-Doping Agency rules. Landis indicated that he would appeal the test results with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|Xanax and {{hydrocodone}} {{were also}} found in Chris Benoit's system, at levels investigators called consistent with therapeutic use. Elevated levels of <b>synthetic</b> anabolic steroid <b>testosterone</b> cypionate were found in his urine; investigators believed that the level found suggested it had been taken recently.

Luger was arrested after {{a search of the}} {{residence}} revealed a number of illicit controlled substances, including anabolic steroids, OxyContin, <b>synthetic</b> growth hormone, <b>testosterone,</b> and Alprazolam. He was charged with 13 felony counts of drug possession. He was released the following day on $27,500 bail. Hulette's death was eventually ruled accidental. Luger pleaded guilty to the charges and was fined $1,000, sentenced to five years probation, and ordered to undergo periodic drug tests.|$|R
25|$|The Tour {{continued}} to be embroiled in doping controversies even after it finished. It emerged that Spanish cyclist (and 16th placed rider) Iban Mayo had tested positive for EPO on the second rest day, on 24 July. He was suspended by his team Saunier Duval-Prodir. Mayo had previously tested positive for <b>synthetic</b> <b>testosterone</b> during the 2007 Giro d'Italia, but the UCI found {{that he had not}} breached any doping regulation.|$|E
25|$|On 27 July 2006 the Phonak team {{announced}} that Floyd Landis, {{winner of the}} 2006 Tour, tested positive after stage 17 for an abnormally high ratio of the hormone testosterone to epitestosterone. On the day the allegations were made public, Landis denied doping. Landis' personal doctor later revealed the test had found a ratio of 11:1 in Landis' blood; the permitted ratio is 4:1. On 31 July 2006 The New York Times reported that tests on Landis' sample revealed some <b>synthetic</b> <b>testosterone.</b> He was later stripped of his title and banned from cycling for two years.|$|E
25|$|Following stage 16, Cofidis rider, Cristian Moreni, {{was arrested}} by French police after testing {{positive}} for <b>synthetic</b> <b>testosterone</b> after stage 11. With this, the entire Cofidis team withdrew {{the rest of their}} team from the Tour. Later that evening, news broke that overall leader, Michael Rasmussen, was withdrawn from the Tour by his Rabobank team due to allegedly lying about his whereabouts during a three-week training session in Mexico in which he was unavailable for UCI doping controls. This elevated Alberto Contador to the overall lead of the race. However, as this occurred after the jersey presentations of Stage 16, there would be no maillot jaune wearer on Stage 17.|$|E
50|$|Testosterone, {{the most}} active anabolic-androgenic steroid {{produced}} by Leydig cells in the testes, was first isolated in 1935 and chemically synthesized later in the same year. <b>Synthetic</b> derivatives of <b>testosterone</b> quickly followed. By {{the end of the}} following decade, both testosterone and its derivatives were applied with varying degrees of success for a number of medical conditions. It was not until the 1950s, however, that athletes began to discover that anabolic steroids could increase their muscle mass. According to sports physician John Ziegler, the first confirmed use of an anabolic steroid in an international athletic competition was at the weightlifting championships in Vienna in 1954, when the Russians weightlifters used testosterone.|$|R

2500|$|Armstrong and Team RadioShack {{maintained}} that Landis and his coach {{had asked for}} a spot on , and Landis only went public with the allegations after being denied a contract. Landis also alleged that he assisted Levi Leipheimer and Dave Zabriskie in taking EPO before the Tour of California one year. In an ESPN interview that day, Landis steadfastly denied that he had used <b>synthetic</b> <b>testosterone</b> during the 2006 Tour de France, but admitted to using human growth hormone and other doping modalities. The 2006 Tour de France was the only race to produce evidence Landis had ever used banned substances.

In June 2008, the International Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed Landis's appeal, disqualifying him from the 2006 Tour de France, and so stripping him of his win and suspending him from the sport for two years.|$|E
2500|$|Rather than contesting his own doping case, Papp {{met with}} USADA officer Travis Tygart in early 2007, {{and agreed to}} testify in the USADA {{arbitration}} hearing examining Floyd Landis' positive result for testosterone at the 2006 Tour de France. He also revealed the identity of two corrupt American doctors who had prescribed him banned drugs. At the Landis hearing, Papp described how <b>synthetic</b> <b>testosterone</b> gel helped him to recover during multi-day stage races. USADA used this testimony to refute earlier claims by Landis' attorneys that testosterone could not help Landis win the 2006 Tour, {{and that he would}} be unlikely to use it if he knew the substance was detectable by testing. Papp rebutted both of these claims, saying it was easy to stay below the threshold of a positive test, and that the gel helped him greatly in recovering between stages.|$|E
40|$|Context: Normal healthy men {{and women}} undergo a gradual loss of {{skeletal}} muscle mass and strength with advancing age. While androgens are protein anabolic in older men, the metabolic effects in older women are poorly understood.

40|$|Seminal plasma peptide (pGlu-Val-Ala-Asp-Ser-Asp-Gln-Asn), {{synthesized}} following {{data obtained}} from biochemical and mass spectrometry analysis of a highly purified fraction from bovine seminal plasma, was characterized at paracrine level as an “in vitro” modulator of testosterone production in rat Leydig cells. 10 - 8 M synthetic peptide exerted the highest testosterone inhibition in rat Leydig cells stimulated with 50 mU of LH. The basal testosterone production (without LH stimulation) was not influenced by synthetic seminal plasma peptide. In Rana esculenta, spermatogenesis is well characterized at morphological, endocrine and paracrine levels. Spermatogonial multiplication occurs in late winter-early spring, while spermatocytes (I and II) and spermatids are rare or totally absent. Progression of spermatogenesis lasts until autumn with spermatids and appearance of spermatozoa. After the winter stasis, in the germinal compartment of the testis, only spermatogonia and spermatozoa are observed, due to the degeneration of the other stages. The aim of our research was to study the influence of synthetic seminal plasma peptide in amphibian testicular steroidogenesis during the annual reproductive cycle of the male frog, Rana esculenta. Male frogs were captured at different times throughout the year and testes were removed, placed in DMEM in presence of 10 mM Hepes, 0. 1 U/ml penicillin G and 0. 1 mg/ml streptomycin and incubated for 6 h at 25 °C with increasing doses of <b>synthetic</b> peptide. <b>Testosterone</b> levels in the incubation medium were measured by radioimmunoassay.

40|$|PURPOSE: This {{study is}} a {{systematic}} literature review and meta-analysis concerning {{the use of a}} <b>testosterone</b> <b>synthetic</b> analog, oxandrolone, and its use in severe adult burns. METHODS: Randomized prospective clinical studies, in English, Portuguese or Spanish, were sought on the following databases: MEDLINE, COCHRANE, EMBASE and LILACS. There was no restriction in relation to the publication date. RESULTS: This search produced 24 studies on MEDLINE and twelve articles were presented on the COCHRANE database. Sixteen were excluded due to the title not being related to this search or by including children. Of the eigth residual studies, after adaptation to the inclusion criteria, only four were selected. After analyzing the results, two were discarded since they did not present adequate patient characterization and the facts on these articles were analyzed differently from the others, hindering the meta-analysis.

40|$|Background and objectives: Anabolic steroids are <b>synthetic</b> {{derivatives}} of <b>testosterone,</b> {{modified to}} enhance its anabolic actions (promotion of protein synthesis and muscle growth). They have numerous side effects, and {{are on the}} International Olympic Committee’s list of banned substances. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry allows identification and characterisation of steroids and their metabolites in the urine but may not distinguish between pharmaceutical and natural testosterone. Indirect methods to detect doping include determination of the testosterone/epitestosterone glucuronide ratio with suitable cut-off values. Direct evidence may be obtained with a method based on {{the determination of the}} carbon isotope ratio of the urinary steroids. This paper aims to give an overview of the use of anabolic-androgenic steroids in sport and methods used in anti-doping laboratories for their detection in urine, with special emphasis on doping with testosterone. Methods: Review of the recent literature of anabolic steroid testing, athletic use, and adverse effects of anabolic-androgenic steroids.

40|$|Cadmium is {{a common}} {{toxicant}} that is detrimental to many tissues. Although a number of transcriptional signatures have been revealed in different tissues after cadmium treatment, the genes involved in the cadmium caused male reproductive toxicity, and the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we observed that the mice treated with different amount of cadmium in their rodent chow for six months exhibited reduced serum testosterone. We then performed RNA-seq to comprehensively investigate the mice testicular transcriptome to further elucidate the mechanism. Our results showed that hundreds of genes expression altered significantly in response to cadmium treatment. In particular, we found several transcriptional signatures {{closely related to the}} biological processes of regulation of hormone, gamete generation, and sexual reproduction, respectively. The expression of several <b>testosterone</b> <b>synthetic</b> key enzyme genes, such as Star, Cyp 11 a 1, and Cyp 17 a 1, were inhibited by the cadmium exposure. For better understanding of the cadmium-mediated transcriptional regulatory mechanism of the genes, we computationally analyzed the transcription factors binding sites and the mircoRNAs targets of the differentially expressed genes. Our findings suggest that the reproductive toxicity by cadmium exposure is implicated in multiple layers of deregulation of several biological processes and transcriptional regulation in mice...|$|R

40|$|Anabolic {{androgenic}} steroids (AAS) are <b>synthetic</b> derivatives of <b>testosterone</b> used by {{over half}} a million adolescents in the United States for their tissue-building potency and performance-enhancing effects. AAS also affect behavior, including reports of heightened aggression and changes in sexual libido. The expression of sexual and aggressive behaviors {{is a function of}} complex interactions among hormones, social context, and the brain, which is extensively remodeled during adolescence. Thus, AAS may have different consequences on behavior during adolescence and adulthood. Using a rodent model, these studies directly compared the effects of AAS on the expression of male sexual and aggressive behaviors in adolescents and adults. Male Syrian hamsters were injected daily for 14 days with either vehicle or an AAS cocktail containing testosterone cypionate (2 mg/kg), nandrolone decanoate (2 mg/kg), and boldenone undecylenate (1 mg/kg), either during adolescence (27 – 41 days of age) or in adulthood (63 – 77 days of age). The day after the last injection, males were tested for either sexual behavior with a receptive female or agonistic behavior with a male intruder.

40|$|Background: Oxymetholone (17 B-hydroxy- 2 -[hydroxymethylene]- 17 -methyl- 5 a-androstan- 3 -one) is a 17 aalkylated anabolic-androgenic steroid and a <b>synthetic</b> deriva-tive of <b>testosterone.</b> It {{has been}} {{approved}} by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of anemias caused by deficient red cell production. Objectives: This review summarizes the pharmacokinetics, current and future clinical applications, and adverse effects of oxymetholone. Relevant studies were identified using a search of MEDLINE @ through March 2001, supplemented by conference abstracts and presentations. Results: Because of its anabolic properties, oxymetholone has been studied for the treatment of HIV-associated wasting, antitbrombin III deficiency, pediatric growth im-pairment, and damaged myocardium, with varying degrees of success. Hepatotoxicity is a major adverse effect {{associated with the use of}} oxymetholone, with cholestatic jaundice the most important hepatic side effect. Less common hepatic side effects associated with the use of anabolic-androgenic steroids include peliosis hepatis and formation of hepatic tumors. All anabolic-androgenic steroids can cause androgenic side effects, including acne, hirsutism, hair loss, clitoral/phallic enlargement, vocal changes, erectile tissue stim-ulation, gynecomastia, amenorrhea, and changes in libido and sexual potency. Conclusions: As is the case with many anabolic-androgenic steroids, few pharmacoki-netic and tolerability studies were performed before oxymetholone’s approval in the 1960 s.

40|$|Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) are <b>synthetic</b> {{derivatives}} of <b>testosterone</b> {{originally developed}} for clinical purposes, but now predominantly taken at suprapharmacological levels as drugs of abuse. To date, nearly 100 different AAS compounds that vary in metabolic fate and physiological effects {{have been designed}} and synthesised. While administered {{for their ability to}} enhance muscle mass and performance, untoward side effects of AAS use include changes in reproductive and sexual behaviours. Specifically, AAS, {{depending on the type of}} compound administered, can delay or advance pubertal onset, lead to irregular oestrous cyclicity, diminished male and female sexual behaviours, and accelerate reproductive senescence. Numerous brains regions and neurotransmitter signalling systems are involved in the generation of these behaviours, and are potential targets for both chronic and acute actions of the AAS. However critical to all of these behaviours is neurotransmission mediated by GABAA receptors within a nexus of interconnected forebrain regions that includes the medial preoptic area (mPOA), the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Here we review how exposure to AAS alters GABAergic transmission and neural activity within these forebrain regions, taking advantage of in vitro systems and both wild-type and genetically altered mouse strains, in order to better understand how these synthetic steroids affect the neural systems that underlie the regulation of reproduction and the expression of sexual behaviours...|$|R
40|$|Androgenic-anabolic steroids (AAS) are <b>synthetic</b> {{derivates}} of <b>testosterone.</b> AAS {{have been}} used as performance enhancing agents since the 1930 `s. They were put on the IOC`s doping list in 1974, but are still widely used. Today AAS are used mostly by adolescents who are not top athletes, but who use AAS to improve performance and appearance. In Norway about 2 % has tried these substances, and the number seems to be increasing. The wanted effects of AAS are increased strength, bodyweight and muscle size. Unfortunately, AAS also have numerous side effects. Some are transient, like acne, oligo-/azoospermia in men, icterus, changes in serum cholesterol levels, hypertension, and elevated hemoglobin levels. Some persists, like striae, peliosis hepatitis, facial hair, clitoris hypertrophy and a deeper voice in women, and decreased final height if AAS is used before puberty. Many general practitioners are unaware of early signs of use, adverse effects and how to do a proper examination, and are thus unable to educate young athletes on this topic. This assignment reviews the physiology of testosterone, what androgenic anabolic steroids are, the adverse effects on the endocrine system, the liver, the blood, the muscles and skeleton, the skin, and the risk of infections.

40|$|Severe thermal {{injury is}} {{associated}} with hypermetabolism and hyper-catabolism, leading to skeletal muscle breakdown, lean body mass loss, weight loss, and negative nitrogen balance. Muscle protein catabolism in patients with severe thermal injury {{is the result of}} stress-induced increased release of cytokines and counterregulatory hormones. Coupled with decreased serum anabolic hormone concentrations such as testosterone and growth hormone along with the presence of insulin resistance, anabolism in patients with severe thermal injury is inefficient or impossible during the acute postburn period. This causes difficulty in restoring lean body mass and regaining lost body weight, as well as poor healing of the burn wound and delayed patient recovery. Oxandrolone, a <b>synthetic</b> derivative of <b>testosterone,</b> has been used in adult patients with severe thermal injury to enhance lean body mass accretion, restore body weight, and accelerate wound healing. In clinical studies, oxandrolone 10 mg orally twice/day improved wound healing, restored lean body mass, and accelerated body weight gain. During the rehabilitation period, oxandrolone therapy with adequate nutrition and exercise improved lean body mass, increased muscle strength, and restored body weight. However, most data on oxandrolone use in adult patients with severe thermal injury are derived from single-center studies, many of which enrolled {{a relatively small number of}} subjects and some of which had a poor design. Multicenter, prospective, randomized studies are needed to better define the optimal oxandrolone dosage and to confirm the efficacy and safety of this drug in adult patients with severe thermal injury.
