25|$|The DMC-12 {{was only}} {{available}} with two factory options; a no-cost manual transmission or automatic transmission ($650 extra) {{and the choice}} of a grey or black interior. Several dealer options were available, including a car cover; floor mats; black textured accent stripes; grey scotch-cal accent stripes; a luggage rack and a ski-rack adapter. The standard feature list included <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>body</b> panels; gull-wing doors with cryogenically treated torsion bars; leather seats; air conditioning; an AM/FM cassette stereo system; power windows, locks and mirrors; a tilt and telescopic steering wheel; tinted glass; body side moldings; intermittent/constant windshield wipers; and an electric rear window defogger.|$|E
500|$|Style and {{structural}} {{elements of the}} Zephyr were incorporated into the EMC [...] "E" [...] series diesel locomotives introduced in 1937, featuring [...] "shovel-nose" [...] front ends beneath their elevated cabs. [...] The E5 units produced for CB paid homage to the original Zephyr trainsets with a <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>body,</b> fluted lower bodywork, horizontal black stripes across the front, and faux grillework flanking the upper headlamp. [...] The lightweight construction introduced to mainline service by the Zephyr trainsets became the standard for new railcars used with the new EMC-powered Diesel streamliners such as the AT Super Chief.|$|E

2500|$|The {{instruction}} manual for the AMT/ERTL DeLorean model kit says: [...] "Because the car's <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>body</b> improves the flux dispersal {{generated by the}} flux capacitor, and this in turn allows the vehicle smooth passage through the space time continuum." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the films}} do not {{describe}} {{exactly how the}} flux capacitor works, Doc mentions {{at one point that}} the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>body</b> of the DeLorean has a direct and influential effect on the [...] "flux dispersal", but he is interrupted before he can finish the explanation. The flux capacitor requires 1.21 gigawatts of electrical power to operate, which is roughly equivalent to the power produced by 15 regular jet engines.|$|E

2500|$|The DeLorean DMC-12 (commonly {{referred}} to simply as [...] "the DeLorean," [...] {{as it was}} the only model ever produced by the company) is a sports car manufactured by John DeLorean's DeLorean Motor Company for the American market from 1981–83. The car features gull-wing doors and an innovative fiberglass body structure with a steel backbone chassis, along with external brushed <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>body</b> panels. It became widely known and iconic for its appearance, and a modified DMC-12 was immortalized as the DeLorean time machine in the Back to the Future media franchise.|$|E
2500|$|The Budd Company got {{its start}} in the early 1930s when Edward G. Budd {{developed}} a way to build carbodies out of stainless steel. [...] In 1932 he completed his first railcar, dubbed the Green Goose. [...] It used rubber tires and a <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>body,</b> and was powered by the engine out of Budd's own Chrysler Imperial automobile. [...] Budd sold {{a few of these}} early powered cars to the Reading Railroad, Pennsylvania Railroad and the Texas and Pacific Railway. [...] The next year, Ralph Budd, only a very distant relation, but president of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad at the time, came to Budd to build the Pioneer Zephyr.|$|E
2500|$|Silverliner is {{the name}} given {{to a series of}} {{electric}} multiple unit railcars in commuter rail service in the Philadelphia area since 1958. [...] As of the introduction of the Silverliner V in 2009-2010, there have been 5 generations of Silverliner cars, identified by the Roman numerals I through V placed after the name Silverliner. [...] The Silverliner name came from the classes' shiny <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>body</b> shell compared with the painted (or rusting) carbon steel railcars placed in service by the Pennsylvania and Reading Railroads between 1915 and 1936. [...] Applied to the first large production order in 1963, the cars made such an impression that the name has since been applied to all subsequent MU classes purchased by SEPTA for the Regional Rail services.|$|E
50|$|The 3000R series {{trainsets}} {{were introduced}} from 2004 {{to replace the}} ageing 1000 series sets. These trains have <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bodies</b> with smooth sides.|$|R

50|$|The 2000 series fleet {{consists}} of seven six-car sets (01 to 07) formed as follows. The trains have <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bodies</b> with different colour front ends and bodyside stripes.|$|R
2500|$|In 1963 the {{financial}} {{condition of the}} Pennsylvania and Reading Railroads was such that neither was able to upgrade their money losing commuter operations on their own. [...] As a result, {{state and local government}} stepped in to purchase new cars that would be in turn used by the private railroads to run the required commuter operations through an entity known as the Passenger Service Improvement Corporation. [...] The new cars would be a production order based on 6 1958 Pioneer III type cars with improvements based on the lessons learned from the earlier design. [...] A total of 38 cars were purchased for the PRR with the remaining 17 going to the Reading. [...] While some referred to the new vehicles as [...] "PSIC Cars", the modern <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>body</b> shells quickly defined the fleet and the name [...] "Silverliner" [...] was soon adopted.|$|E
2500|$|The body {{design of}} the DMC-12 {{was a product of}} Giorgetto Giugiaro of Ital Design and is {{panelled}} in brushed SS304 stainless steel. Except for three cars plated in 24-carat gold, all DMC-12s left the factory uncovered by paint or clearcoat. Painted DeLoreans do exist, although these were all painted after the cars were purchased from the factory. Several hundred DMCs were produced without stainless panels, for training workers, and are referred to as [...] "black cars" [...] or [...] "mules", in reference to their black fiberglass panels instead of stainless, though these were never marketed. Small scratches in the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>body</b> panels can be removed with a non-metallic scouring pad (since metal pads can leave iron particles embedded in the stainless steel which can give the appearance of the stainless [...] "rusting"), or even sandpaper. The stainless steel panels are fixed to a fiberglass underbody. The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, derived from the Lotus Esprit platform.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> {{also known}} as [...] "inox steel" [...] does not stain, corrode, or rust as easily as {{ordinary}} steel.
