5|$|In recent years, {{concepts}} {{based on}} (re-)cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among these concepts {{might be the}} Circular Economy, with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also {{a broad range of}} similar concepts or schools of thought, including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry, and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the <b>social</b> <b>dimension</b> of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and there are cases that require different or additional strategies, like purchasing new, more energy efficient equipment. A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy, namely a (1) conditional relation, a (2) strong conditional relation, a (3) necessary but not sufficient conditional relation, a (4) beneficial relationship a (structured and unstructured) (5) subset relation, a (6) degree relation, a (7) cost-benefit/trade-off relation, and a (8) selective relation.|$|E

The World Commission on the <b>Social</b> <b>Dimension</b> of Globalization was established by the ILO's governing body in February 2002 at the initiative of the director-general {{in response to the}} fact that there did not appear to be a space within the multilateral system that would cover adequately and comprehensively the <b>social</b> <b>dimension</b> of the various aspects of globalization.

40|$|Classification {{based on}} <b>social</b> <b>dimensions</b> is {{commonly}} used to handle the multi-label classification task in heterogeneous networks. However, traditional methods, which mostly rely on the community detection algorithms to extract the latent <b>social</b> <b>dimensions,</b> produce unsatisfactory performance when community detection algorithms fail. In this paper, we propose a novel behavior based <b>social</b> <b>dimensions</b> extraction method to improve the classification performance in multi-label heterogeneous networks. In our method, nodes' behavior features, instead of community memberships, are used to extract <b>social</b> <b>dimensions.</b> By introducing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to model the network generation process, nodes' connection behaviors with different communities can be extracted accurately, which are applied as latent <b>social</b> <b>dimensions</b> for classification. Experiments on various public datasets reveal that the proposed method can obtain satisfactory classification results in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods on smaller <b>social</b> <b>dimensions...</b>|$|R
40|$|It is {{increasingly}} recognized {{that people are}} the center of development, and that development is for all people. The concept of <b>social</b> <b>dimensions</b> captures the key elements of human perspective: including poverty reduction; enhancing {{the role of women}} in development; human resources development including population planning; and avoidance or mitigation of adverse impacts of development interventions on vulnerable groups which do not have the capacity to absorb such effects. The Bank and its developing member countries (DMCs) recognize the importance of incorporating <b>social</b> <b>dimensions</b> into their developing efforts and operations. It is intended that <b>social</b> <b>dimensions</b> build upon the traditions and social and cultural values of the Bank's DMCs. This Handbook is one of a series of publications which provide guidance to Bank staff, staff in executing agencies and consultants about the incorporation of <b>social</b> <b>dimensions</b> into Bank operations. The overall framework for incorporating <b>social</b> <b>dimensions</b> is presented in the Guidelines for Incorporation of <b>Social</b> <b>Dimensions</b> in Bank Operations, October 1993. This Handbook is a supplement to the Guidelines and provides guidance with respect to the incorporation of <b>social</b> <b>dimensions</b> in projects. Guidance on other aspects of incorporation of <b>social</b> <b>dimensions</b> is or will be available from other Handbooks.

25|$|In 1921, Thomas Karsten {{presented}} a paper of the Indies Town Planning at the Decentralisation Congress. The paper was seen {{of a new}} radical idea in which Karsten argued that a town planning is an activity of interconnected components (social, technology, etc.) {{that is needed to}} be addressed harmoniously. His idea for a methodological approach to create an organic town plan with a <b>social</b> <b>dimension</b> received much acclaim in the colony, {{as well as in the}} Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|The temple {{also started}} {{to develop a}} <b>social</b> <b>dimension</b> in its activities. For example, it started {{promoting}} blood donations. The temple also organized training programs for both {{the private and public}} sector, emphasizing peace and stability in society by training government officers to be more reliable. The temple also became active in promoting Buddhist scholarship and educational reform in the Sangha (monastic community), producing a CD with searchable texts of the Pali Canon in 1984, in cooperation with the Pali Text Society, Mahidol University and the University of California in Berkeley. In 1990, the temple also organized its first academic seminar Buddhism into the Year 2000, with over a hundred international scholars joining. On a more local level, the temple started to organize a yearly congratulation ceremony for Pali graduates at the highest level, and offered funds to temples that excelled at teaching Pali. The temple was known to have wide support from the Thai Sangha and was tolerated by the government, though at times the government asked the temple to limit its mass assemblies. In 1985, the Department of Religious Affairs, Ministry of Education, prohibited the building of a meditation center in the province, citing as a reason that it was not accessible enough for people to visit. Fuengfusakul concludes that during this period the government was afraid of the temple's ability to gather a large number of people.|$|E

He extended it to the condemnation of abortion, euthanasia and virtually all capital punishment, calling them all {{a part of the}} [...] "culture of death" [...] that is pervasive in the modern world. He campaigned for world debt forgiveness and social justice. He coined the term [...] "social mortgage", which related that all private property had a <b>social</b> <b>dimension,</b> namely, that [...] "the goods of this are originally meant for all." [...] In 2000, he publicly endorsed the Jubilee 2000 campaign on African debt relief fronted by Irish rock stars Bob Geldof and Bono, once famously interrupting a U2 recording session by telephoning the studio and asking to speak to Bono.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{patterns}} of biographical experience that are linked with subsequent {{mental health problems}} and pathways into homelessness. Martens states that reported childhood experiences, described as [...] "feeling unloved in childhood, adverse childhood experiences, and general unhappiness in childhood" [...] seem to become [...] "powerful risk factors" [...] for adult homelessness. For example, Martens emphasizes the salient dimension of familial and residential instability, as he describes the prevalence of foster-care or group home placement for homeless adolescents. He notes that [...] "58 percent of homeless adolescents had experienced some kind of out-of-home placement, running away, or early departure from home." [...] Moreover, up to 50 percent of homeless adolescents report experience with physical abuse, and almost one-third report sexual abuse. In addition to family conflict and abuse, early exposure to factors like poverty, housing instability, and {{alcohol and drug use}} all increase one's vulnerability to homelessness. [...] Once impoverished, the <b>social</b> <b>dimension</b> of homelessness manifests from [...] "long exposure to demoralizing relationships and unequal opportunities." ...|$|E

[...] "How do we define ourselves within a cultural context that wants to reduce complex realities to simplistic clichés?" [...] he asked rhetorically. He told the online journal Inside Higher Ed: [...] "We are, I think, {{a different kind of}} Christian... If [...] assume they’re going to find at EMU what they would also find at Liberty University [...] they’re not going to be very happy here. They’re going to run into it headlong. They’re going to hear about the peace tradition. They’re going to hear a lot of language {{about what it means to}} be a follower of Jesus in this world. From our perspective, that means less nationalism, and a much more global perspective, care for creation. What they would find here is a concern for personal piety … but we’re not willing to stop there because we also believe that the New Testament is pretty clear that there is a <b>social</b> <b>dimension</b> to what Jesus called us to be and to do.” ...|$|E
