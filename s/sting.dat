5|$|Heading into Turning Point, Styles and <b>Sting</b> {{argued over}} <b>Sting</b> assaulting Styles at Hard Justice. On the October30 episode of Impact!, newly made {{co-owner}} of TNA Mick Foley advertised <b>Sting</b> defending the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Styles at Turning Point. <b>Sting</b> retained the title at the event. <b>Sting</b> and Styles fought again at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on December7, {{this time in}} an Eight Man Tag Team Match pitting The Main Event Mafia (<b>Sting,</b> Nash, Steiner, and Booker T) against The TNA Front Line (Styles, Joe, Brother Devon, and Brother Ray) for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. The Main Event Mafia won the match, thus <b>Sting</b> retained the championship {{for a second time}} against Styles. <b>Sting</b> and Styles fought one last time for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, but not for several months. They clashed one final time at the 2009 Bound for Glory event on October18. At that event, Styles headed into the bout as the TNA World Heavyweight Champion. Styles defeated <b>Sting</b> to retain the championship at the show.|$|E
5|$|Queen {{and worker}} {{bumblebees}} can <b>sting.</b> Unlike in honeybees, a bumblebee's <b>sting</b> lacks barbs, so the bee can <b>sting</b> repeatedly without injuring itself; {{by the same}} token, the <b>sting</b> is not left in the wound. Bumblebee species are not normally aggressive, but may <b>sting</b> in defence of their nest, or if harmed. Female cuckoo bumblebees aggressively attack host colony members, and <b>sting</b> the host queen, but ignore other animals unless disturbed.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship in which the {{champion}} Samoa Joe defended against the challenger <b>Sting.</b> The duration of the encounter was 16 minutes and 54 seconds. The beginning of the match had Joe on the offensive, with Joe performing a dive between the ropes to hit <b>Sting</b> {{in the face with}} his forearm. The competitors then fought throughout the crowd for an extended period. At one point while the two were fighting on the arena steps, Joe jumped from a luxury box and kicked <b>Sting</b> down the stairs. Afterwards, <b>Sting</b> and Joe fought back towards the ring with each trading the offensive advantage. Back in the ring, <b>Sting</b> earned a near-fall after an aerial splash from the top of a turnbuckle. Joe placed <b>Sting</b> in an STF submission hold after a powerbomb next. <b>Sting</b> reached the ropes, causing the hold to be broken by the referee. <b>Sting</b> threw Joe into a ring corner and performed his signature Stinger Splash before lifting Joe up and slamming Joe neck-first onto the mat with Joe's signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe got up off the mat immediately and attacked <b>Sting.</b> He then slammed <b>Sting</b> head and back-first into the mat with Sting's trademark Scorpion Death Drop maneuver. <b>Sting</b> also got up immediately after the move. Later, Kevin Nash entered the arena and walked to the ringside area. Nash had reportedly left the company but his attendance backstage was leaked to various media outlets. As Joe was arguing with the referee, <b>Sting</b> retrieved a baseball bat that he had left at ringside. Nash pulled the bat from Sting's hands, not allowing him to use it in the match. Afterwards, Joe and <b>Sting</b> fought in the ring when <b>Sting</b> dodged a running Joe, causing him to almost collide with referee Earl Hebner who dodged as well. At this time, Nash hit Joe across the back with the baseball bat when Joe came in contact with the ring ropes. <b>Sting</b> followed by performing the Scorpion Death Drop on Joe and pinned him to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. The event came to a close as <b>Sting</b> celebrated in-front of the crowd.|$|E

It is best known for <b>stinging</b> hairs that cover the whole plant and deliver a potent neurotoxin when touched. It is the most toxic of the Australian species of <b>stinging</b> trees.

5|$|Ants {{attack and}} defend {{themselves}} by biting and, in many species, by stinging, often injecting or spraying chemicals, such as formic acid {{in the case}} of formicine ants, alkaloids and piperidines in fire ants, and a variety of protein components in other ants. Bullet ants (Paraponera), located in Central and South America, are considered to have the most painful <b>sting</b> of any insect, although it is usually not fatal to humans. This <b>sting</b> is given the highest rating on the Schmidt <b>Sting</b> Pain Index.|$|E
5|$|In {{individuals}} {{allergic to}} the venom (about 2–3% of the population), a <b>sting</b> sometimes causes anaphylactic shock. In comparison to other insects {{such as the}} western honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the European wasp (Vespula germanica), their rates are only 1.4% and 0.6%. The annual <b>sting</b> exposure rates for the jack jumper ant, Western honeybee and European wasp are 12%, 7% and 2%. The median time from <b>sting</b> to cardiac arrest is 15 minutes, but the maximum period is around three hours. The ant allergy does not disappear; people with jack jumper allergies will most likely suffer from another allergic reaction if re-stung. Approximately 70 percent of patients {{with a history of}} systemic reaction to the ant's <b>sting</b> have another reaction when stung again. In comparison, systemic reaction figures for Apis mellifera and Vespula germanica after being stung show a rate of 50% and 25%. About half of these reactions were life-threatening and occurred predominantly in people who had had previous incidents with the <b>sting.</b> Anaphylaxis in jack jumper ant stings are not rare; 2.9% of 600 residents from semi-rural Victoria had allergic reactions to the ant's <b>sting,</b> according to a questionnaire. The sensitivity to stings is persistent for many years.|$|E
5|$|After Victory Road, Cage befriended the {{new number}} one {{contender}} <b>Sting</b> on the July 27, 2006 episode of Impact!, by asking for forgiveness for doubting Sting's agenda by coming to TNA in January of that year. He {{went on to}} say that he had asked Jim Cornette the week before if he could be in Sting's corner in his match with Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event, but had told him he needed Sting's approval. <b>Sting</b> accepted Cage's offer, with interviewer and occasional ring announcer Jeremy Borash announcing Sting's decision in a backstage segment on the August 3, 2006 episode of Impact!. On August 13, 2006, Cage was in Sting's corner at Hard Justice as he faced Jarrett, with Scott Steiner in his corner, for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. During the contest, Cage interfered to help <b>Sting</b> win numerous times, as did Steiner for Jarrett, until Cage turned on <b>Sting</b> by taking Jarrett's signature guitar and bashing it over his head—changing his character from a face to a heel. He then allowed Jarrett to pin <b>Sting</b> and retain the title.|$|E
50|$|Panic Attack {{drove into}} <b>Stinger,</b> but {{found it hard}} to attack. <b>Stinger</b> used its axe on Panic Attack's sides and lifting mechanism. <b>Stinger</b> spun around and hit Panic Attack many times. Panic Attack pushed <b>Stinger</b> into Matilda, but went into the CPZ. Panic Attack then pushed <b>Stinger</b> into the arena wall, but the judges {{decision}} meant that <b>Stinger</b> was the winner, who finished 3rd overall.|$|R
50|$|Female euglossines have a {{powerful}} <b>stinging</b> apparatus. However, bee <b>stings</b> are rare as they are solitary and do not zealously protect their nests. Males, on the other hand, do not have <b>stings.</b> <b>Stings</b> give females an evolutionary advantage over males. As a defense mechanism, the <b>stinging</b> apparatus explains the sex ratio {{in favor of the}} females.|$|R
50|$|The AIM-92 <b>Stinger</b> or ATAS (Air To Air <b>Stinger)</b> is an {{air-to-air missile}} {{developed}} from the shoulder-launched FIM-92 <b>Stinger</b> system, for use on helicopters such as the AH-64 Apache, Eurocopter Tiger and also UAVs such as the MQ-1 Predator. The missile itself {{is identical to the}} shoulder-launched <b>Stinger.</b>|$|R
5|$|Christian's old WWE {{enforcer}} Tyson Tomko (now going {{simply by}} Tomko) made his TNA debut on the November 23, 2006 episode of Impact! helping Cage in a match against <b>Sting.</b> Cage, with Tomko at his side, {{set his sights}} on the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, now held by Abyss. At TNA's Turning Point PPV event on December 10, 2006, Cage fought Abyss and <b>Sting</b> in a three way match for the NWA Title. Cage failed to win the match, as Abyss won to retain the championship after pinning <b>Sting.</b>|$|E

5|$|Desensitisation (also called allergy immunotherapy) to {{the jack}} jumper <b>sting</b> venom has shown {{effectiveness}} in preventing anaphylaxis, but the standardisation of jack jumper venom {{is yet to}} be validated. Unlike bee and wasp <b>sting</b> immunotherapy, jack jumper immunotherapy lacks funding and no government rebate is available. Venom is available; however, no commercial venom extract is available {{that can be used for}} skin testing. Venom extract is only available through the Therapeutic Goods Administration Special Access Scheme.|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims Once {{human skin}} {{contacts}} <b>stinging</b> hairs of Urtica spp. (<b>stinging</b> nettles), the irritant is released and produces pain, wheals or a <b>stinging</b> sensation which may last for > 12 [*]h. However, {{the existence of}} pain-inducing toxins in the <b>stinging</b> hairs of Urtica thunbergiana has never been systematically demonstrated. Experiments were therefore conducted to identify the persistent pain-inducing agents in the <b>stinging</b> hairs of U. thunbergiana...|$|R

50|$|When a {{honey bee}} <b>stings</b> a person, it cannot pull the barbed <b>stinger</b> back out. It leaves behind {{not only the}} <b>stinger,</b> but also part of its abdomen and {{digestive}} tract, plus muscles and nerves. This massive abdominal rupture kills the honey bee. Honey bees are the only bees to die after <b>stinging.</b>|$|R
5|$|Few parasites and predators are {{effective}} for biological control of cockroaches. Parasitoidal wasps such as Ampulex wasps <b>sting</b> nerve ganglia in the cockroach's thorax, temporarily paralyzing the victim, allowing the wasp {{to deliver a}} second <b>sting</b> into the cockroach's brain. The wasp clips the antennae with its mandibles and drinks some hemolymph before dragging the prey to a burrow, where an egg is laid on it. The wasp larva feeds on the subdued living cockroach.|$|E
5|$|Following Bound for Glory IV, TNA {{continued}} the rivalry between the veteran wrestlers {{and the younger}} wrestlers. At Turning Point on November9, TNA held several matches connected to this overall narrative. Since Samoa Joe and <b>Sting</b> agreed on the stipulation {{that there would be}} no rematch between the two, <b>Sting</b> went on to feud with A.J. Styles while Joe fought Kevin Nash. On the October23 episode of Impact!, the veterans in TNA formed the group The Main Event Mafia, consisting of <b>Sting,</b> Kurt Angle, Nash, Booker T, and Scott Steiner. Meanwhile, the younger wrestlers formed The TNA Front Line led by Joe and Styles.|$|E

50|$|The worker bee's <b>stinger</b> is {{a complex}} organ that allows a bee to defend itself and the hive from most mammals. Attacking bees aim for the face by sensing regions {{with high levels of}} carbon dioxide (like mosquitos). Bee <b>stings</b> against mammals and birds {{typically}} leave the <b>stinger</b> embedded in the victim due to the structure of flesh and the stinger's barbs. In this case, the venom bulb stays with the <b>stinger</b> and continues to pump. Upon losing its <b>stinger,</b> the bee will subsequently die since the portion where the <b>stinger</b> bulb was removed rips out part of its insides.|$|R

5|$|M. nigrocincta ants have highly venomous stings {{which are}} painful and produce intense burning sensations. The sensations last for many {{days and the}} <b>sting</b> itches. If left untreated, the <b>sting</b> may develop into an ulcer. The venom of a closely related species, M. pilosula is amongst the strongest of the Formicidae and {{contains}} active ingredients such as acid and alkaline phosphatases, hyaluronidase, as well as phospholipases A2 and B. In a 2011 Australian ant allergy venom study, the objective of which was to determine what native Australian ants were associated with ant <b>sting</b> anaphylaxis, it was shown that 265 of the 376 participants taking {{part of the study}} reacted to the <b>sting</b> of several Myrmecia species. Of these, 176 reacted to the M. pilosula, 15 to M. nigrocincta, three to M. ludlowi, and 56 to other Myrmecia ants. The study concluded that four main groups of Australian ants were responsible for causing anaphylaxis. Besides Myrmecia species, these included the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica).|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia ants deter many {{potential}} predators {{due to their}} <b>sting.</b> The blindsnake Ramphotyphlops nigrescens consumes the larvae and pupae of Myrmecia, while avoiding the potent <b>sting</b> of the adults, which it is vulnerable to. The short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) also eats the eggs and larvae. Nymphs of the assassin bug species Ptilocnemus lemur lure these ants to themselves by {{trying to make the}} ant <b>sting</b> them, by waving its hind legs around to attract a potential prey item. Body remains of Myrmecia have been found in the stomach contents of the eastern yellow robin (Eopsaltria australis). The Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), the black currawong (Strepera versicolor), and the white-winged chough (Corcorax melanorhamphos) prey on these ants, but few are successfully taken.|$|E

50|$|Vespa <b>stings</b> {{are very}} painful to humans. They have smooth {{stingers}} {{that can be}} used multiple times. Humans can die from many <b>stings</b> suffered at once. Some people also suffer severe allergic reactions to <b>stings.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Sting</b> and Styles {{went on to}} {{have another}} match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Final Resolution. This time, the team of <b>Sting,</b> Steiner, Nash, and Booker T faced off against Styles, Joe, and two mystery {{partners}} (The TNA Front Line) in an Eight Man Tag Team match. The stipulations were if anyone from Styles' team pinned a member of Sting's team, then Styles won the TNA Title, while if anyone from Sting's team pinned a member of Styles' team, then <b>Sting</b> retained the title. The match was announced on the November 20 episode of Impact!. Styles' mystery partners were revealed on the November 27 episode of Impact! as Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). <b>Sting</b> went on to retain the title at Final Resolution after he pinned Joe.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sting</b> {{made his}} TNA wrestling debut at Final Resolution on January15, 2006, teaming with Christian Cage to face Jeff Jarrett and Monty Brown. This match was {{announced}} on the December31, 2005 episode of Impact!. The team of Cage and <b>Sting</b> won the match at the event. This led to Cage facing Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February12, 2006. Cage won the encounter {{to become the}} new champion.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sting</b> {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} and appeared on the January28 episode of Impact! where he announced his scripted retirement. <b>Sting</b> did not appear in TNA until their Destination X PPV event on March12 when he appeared after the main event to save Cage from an assault by America's Most Wanted, Abyss, Alex Shelley, Team Canada, Jarrett, and Brown before being attacked himself by the debuting Scott Steiner. <b>Sting</b> then teamed with Styles, Killings and Rhino {{as part of a}} team referred to as Sting's Warriors against Jarrett's Army, composed of Jarrett, Steiner, and America's Most Wanted in a Four-on-Four Lethal Lockdown match at TNA's Lockdown PPV event on April23.
