Charles Laughton visited in 1961, saying “I have just seen the four best productions of Shakespeare that I have ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life.” Laughton begged to play King Lear, but died in 1962 before he could fulfill the dream. Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper visited in 1962, attending two plays. Stacy Keach was a cast member in 1962 and 1963. Duke Ellington and his orchestra presented a benefit concert in 1966 that brought many luminaries to Ashland.|$|E

Robert Patrick later called the {{eventual}} set [...] "the biggest damned thing I'd <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf and Matthew Mungle, the show's make-up effect producers, used several unorthodox ingredients to create the effect of melted flesh; in addition to the use of normal prosthetic make-up, the two also used a combination of figs and Fruit Roll-Ups.|$|E

500|$|Taylor {{was born}} in Beaufort, North Carolina to parents Willie Ray, {{who worked as a}} mason, and Bettie, who was a crab picker at the local seafood plant. He was the second of four children, and was named for the lead {{character}} in the movie Brian's Song. Taylor attended East Carteret High School in Beaufort and played on the school baseball team. In high school, Taylor had a win–loss record of 29-6 and an earned run average (ERA) of 1.25. He also struck out 213 hitters in 88 innings pitched while walking 28. His fastball often hit 98 and 99mph. The New York Yankees selected Taylor with the first overall selection in the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft, and he signed Scott Boras as an advisor, who said of him in 2006, [...] "Brien Taylor, still to this day, is the best high school pitcher I've <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Medusa" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz and directed by Richard Compton. Reportedly, because {{of the scope of}} the episode, a [...] "huge budget" [...] was allotted for the entry. Because the episode was written to take place in a subway system, a set meeting the requirements of the script had to be created. The eventual set was designed to mirror the actual Boston subway, a system that serves more than 700,000 people a day. According to star Robert Patrick, [...] "They got us in there, and we did it, and they built a huge subway tunnel set on a soundstage." [...] Patrick later described the set as [...] "the biggest damned thing I'd ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] In real life, the Boston subway system is [...] "fondly" [...] called the T, short for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. In [...] "Medusa", the [...] "T", was changed to an [...] "M" [...] "for fictional purposes".|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} sequence {{within the}} episode was the time-shift which ends in Tommy returning to 1918. Goddard {{noted that the}} time-shift [...] "essentially happened off-screen" [...] and that what the audience sees is [...] "great big wind machines and camera lights". Anthony Lewis described the wind machine used as [...] "the biggest wind machine I've ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life". [...] He comments that {{the intensity of the}} wind machine and the lighting enabled an [...] "instant-made reaction" [...] from himself and Mori. Goddard added that his first assistant director was [...] "instrumental in gearing up all the extras into a frenzy". The episode's soundtrack included the song [...] "One of These Mornings" [...] by Moby, which featured the vocals of Patti Labelle, from his 2002 album, 18. The track heard in the pub scene is [...] "She's Got You High" [...] from Mumm-Ra's 2007 debut album These Things Move in Threes.|$|E

500|$|The second season, in 1945, {{featured}} two double-bills. The first {{consisted of}} Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2. Olivier played the warrior Hotspur {{in the first}} and the doddering Justice Shallow in the second. He received good notices, but by general consent the production belonged to Richardson as Falstaff. Agate wrote, [...] "He had everything the part wants – the exuberance, the mischief, the gusto.... Here is something better than virtuosity in character-acting – the spirit of the part shining through the actor." [...] As a teenager, the director Peter Hall saw the production; he said fifty years later, [...] "Of the performances I've <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life I'm gladdest I saw that." [...] In the second double bill it was Olivier who dominated, in the title roles of Oedipus Rex and The Critic. Richardson took the supporting role of Tiresias in the first, and the silent, cameo part of Lord Burleigh in the second. After the London season the company played both the double-bills and Uncle Vanya in a six-week season on Broadway.|$|E
500|$|To {{represent}} the ex-Borg colony on the planet, sets previously {{used for the}} episodes [...] "The Chute" [...] and [...] "" [...] from {{earlier in the season}} were used. This was further extended by the use of a computer generated matte painting created by freelancer Eric Chauvin. Borg sets from First Contact were not re-used, but instead a new set was built. This new set measured [...] in length curved around in a semi-circle, and McNeill was unsatisfied with this size. He said [...] "It was the smallest set that I've ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life. We had no room on the stage to build a big Borg ship, because the other sets took up so much room." [...] He hoped that they had hidden this on camera, with it instead appearing as a series of separate corridors within the Borg vessel. McNeill explained that he had the actors walk the length of the set past the camera at the end, at which point a cut was made and they would go back {{to the start of the}} corridor to start filming again.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} game in Moscow, Henderson scored a goal to help Canada {{establish}} a 4–1 lead, but also suffered a concussion when he was tripped into the boards and knocked unconscious. He returned to finish the game, but the Soviets came back to win, 5–4, and were one victory shy of winning the series. In game six, Canada overcame what coach Harry Sinden called [...] "the worst officials I have ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life" [...] to win by a 3–2 score, with Henderson scoring the game-winning goal. [...] The game was also notable for Bobby Clarke using his stick in a two-handed slash that broke Valeri Kharlamov's ankle. [...] Henderson later called the event [...] "the low point of the series" [...] during the 30th anniversary celebration, but apologized for his comments after Clarke took umbrage. Canada drew even in the series at three wins apiece, plus one tie, with a 4–3 victory in game seven. [...] Henderson again scored the winner despite being tripped {{as he took the}} shot.|$|E

500|$|Some reviewers {{felt that}} the story and {{dialogue}} were weak, while the visuals were spectacular. Kenneth Turan's review in the Los Angeles Times was particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, [...] "What really brings on the tears is Cameron's insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities. Not only is it not, {{it is not even}} close.", and later claimed that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total. Barbara Shulgasser of The San Francisco Examiner gave Titanic one star out of four, citing a friend as saying, [...] "The number of times in this unbelievably badly written script that the two [...] refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say." [...] Also, filmmaker Robert Altman called it [...] "the most dreadful piece of work I've ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> entire life". In his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on the Titanic, historian Richard Davenport-Hines said, [...] "Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered".|$|E
500|$|Bavaro {{was born}} in Winthrop, Massachusetts. He {{attended}} Danvers High School in Danvers, Massachusetts, {{where he was a}} high school football All-American. He was a well-rounded athlete who also excelled in track and field at Danvers. After being intensively recruited by several colleges, he chose to play collegiately for the University of Notre Dame. He was recruited by head coach Dan Devine but played his four years under coach Gerry Faust. He played behind star tight end Tony Hunter as a freshman, then missed all but three minutes of his [...] season due to a hand injury. He established himself as a starter as a junior, but grew home-sick and briefly contemplated quitting the team to move back home following the season. After Faust talked him into staying, he won All-America honors his senior season, when he totalled 32 receptions for 395yards. Bavaro developed a reputation for playing through injuries while at Notre Dame. [...] "He plays with pain better than any player I've <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> 37 years of coaching" [...] Faust later stated. He left Notre Dame after graduating in 1985 despite having one season of eligibility remaining (due to the redshirt status of his sophomore season) and was selected in the fourth round (#100 overall) of the 1985 NFL Draft by the New York Giants.|$|E
500|$|Pauline Kael {{said it was}} [...] "a monumentally unimaginative movie", and Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic {{called it}} [...] "a film that is so dull, it even dulls our {{interest}} in the technical ingenuity {{for the sake of}} which Kubrick has allowed it to become dull." [...] Renata Adler of The New York Times wrote that it was [...] "somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring." [...] Variety's 'Robe' believed the film was a [...] "ig, beautiful, but plodding sci-fi epic... A major achievement in cinematography and special effects, 2001 lacks dramatic appeal to a large degree and only conveys suspense after the halfway mark." [...] Andrew Sarris called it [...] "one of the grimmest films I have ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life...2001 is a disaster because it is much too abstract to make its abstract points." [...] (Sarris reversed his opinion upon a second viewing of the film, and declared, [...] "2001 is indeed a major work by a major artist.") John Simon felt it was [...] "a regrettable failure, although not a total one. This film is fascinating when it concentrates on apes or machines... and dreadful when it deals with the in-betweens: humans...2001, for all its lively visual and mechanical spectacle, is a kind of space-Spartacus and, more pretentious still, a shaggy God story." [...] Eminent historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. deemed the film [...] "morally pretentious, intellectually obscure and inordinately long... a film out of control". The BBC said that its slow pacing often alienates modern audiences more than it did upon its initial release.|$|E

500|$|When {{he arrived}} with the Reds organization, Bates was {{assigned}} to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds of the AA. In a play-in game to determine the leader of the AA Eastern division, and thus the team that qualified for the playoffs, the Sounds played against the Buffalo Bisons. Nashville manager Pete Mackanin called the contest [...] "the most absurd game I've ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life": the match, which lasted 18 innings, ended when Chris Jones hit a double that scored Bates. Nashville played another extra-inning game, this time a 20-inning contest on September 7, against the Western-champion Omaha Royals in the playoffs and lost. Later, the Sounds lost the series three games to two; Bates' season, however, was not over, as the Reds added him to their MLB roster. In his Cincinnati debut on September 11, Bates came into the game as a pinch runner and scored on a Billy Doran hit. Dorana second baseman the Reds acquired from the Houston Astros in a [...] "last-minute" [...] deal before the trade deadlinewas hospitalized with back pain and spasms on September 29. Doctors performed an operation on October 3, which would hold him out of postseason play as Cincinnati won the National League West; the Reds were the first team in National League history to lead a division for an entire 162-game season. In a move that surprised Bates, who already prepared to return to his Houston residence after the Reds' last regular-season game, the club added him to their postseason roster.|$|E
