Moreover, the mechanism of debonding has been studied considering the influence of various factors, such as, bond length, geometry of the specimen, tests <b>set-up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> of the fibre reinforcing system. It also can be observed that the wide variety of the masonry substrates, formed by clay or concrete bricks (or blocks), affects the overall performance of the reinforcement system [10 - 14].|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to demonstrate the importance of experimental <b>set-up</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> of coformer for the enhanced dissolution properties of cocrystals. Carbamazepine–saccharin and carbamazepine–nicotinamide cocrystals were prepared by the sonic slurry method and characterised with SEM, DSC, XRPD and particle size analysis. Solubility and dissolution testing (closed and open system) were performed in compendial media and media with a physiologically relevant amount of surfactant. Carbamazepine cocrystals (1 : 1 molar ratio) did not show a difference in the equilibrium solubility compared to the carbamazepine in compendial media but a substantial difference was observed in modified media. In compendial media, a faster dissolution rate was obtained only from the carbamazepine–saccharin cocrystal, whereas in modified media both cocrystals had a substantial higher dissolution compared to carbamazepine. With the selected method a clear difference in the dissolution profiles of each cocrystal is shown, driven by the characteristics of the coformer used. This study demonstrated that improved dissolution of carbamazepine from the cocrystal forms can be revealed only by appropriate selection of in vitro conditions. The characteristics of the coformer define a critical variable for dissolution of pharmaceutical cocrystals with important implications for their in vivo performance...|$|R

40|$|Many {{therapeutic}} antibodies {{have been}} developed, and IgG antibodies have been exten-sively generated in various cell expression systems. IgG antibodies contain N-glycans at the constant {{region of the}} heavy chain (Fc domain), and their N-glycosylation patterns differ during various processes or among cell expression systems. The FcN-glycan can modulate the effector functions of IgG antibodies, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). To control Fc N-glycans, we per-formed a rearrangement of Fc N-glycans from a heterogeneous N-glycosylation pattern to homogeneous N-glycans using chemoenzymatic approaches with two types of endo-β-N-acetyl glucosaminidases (ENG’ases), one that works as a hydrolase to cleave all heteroge-neous N-glycans, another that {{is used as a}} glycosynthase to generate homogeneous N-gly-cans.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the differences in}} palliative radiotherapy for painful bone metastases amongst different Western European countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 565 radiotherapy centres in 19 Western European countries, based on the 1997 ESTRO directory. In this questionnaire the current local palliative radiotherapy practice for bone metastases was assessed in terms of total dose, fractionation, treatment complexity (use of shielding blocks, frequency of isodose calculations, field <b>set-up)</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> of machine used. The differences were analyzed according to the country <b>and</b> to the <b>type</b> <b>and</b> size of radiotherapy centre. RESULTS: A total of 205 centres (36 %) returned the questionnaire, of which 198 could be further analyzed. The most frequently used antalgic fractionation schedule is 30 Gy in ten daily fractions of 3 Gy (50 %), single fractions and conventional 2 Gy fractions being used in {{a minority of the}} centres (respectively, 11 and 9 %). Most antalgic treatments are performed on a linear accelerator (67 % of the centres uses linear accelerators) and 64 % of the centres predominantly uses a two-field set-up. The majority of the centres uses shielding blocks and performs isodose calculations in less than 50 % of the patients, (respectively, 88 and 81 %). There is a correlation between the centre size and the palliative irradiation practice, the largest centres using more hypofractionation (chi(2) : P= 0. 001; logit: P= 0. 0003) and a less complex treatment set up as expressed by the use of isodose calculations (chi(2) : P= 0. 027; logit: P= 0. 0161). There is also a tendency to use less shielding blocks (P= 0. 177). The same goes for university centres as compared with private centres: university centres use shorter fractionation schedules (chi(2) : P= 0. 008; logit: P= 0. 0094), less isodoses (chi(2) : P= 0. 010; logit: P= 0. 0115) and somewhat less shielding blocks (P= 0. 151). Amongst the analyzed countries different tendencies in fractionation (P= 0. 001) and treatment complexity are observed (use of isodoses: P= 0. 014, use of shielding blocks: P= 0. 001). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that beside work-load and clinical evidence, country-related factors such as tradition and habits, past teaching, the national organization of health care and reimbursement criteria may influence the local practice. status: publishe...|$|R

Bone mass measurements were performed in the neck, Ward's triangle and in the trochanteric area of the femur, using dual-photon absorptiometry with 153 Gd. Bone mineral density (BMD) was significantly decreased in <b>Type</b> 1 diabetic <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women as well in <b>Type</b> 2 <b>men,</b> when compared with a non diabetic matched population. In <b>Type</b> 1 <b>men,</b> neck <b>and</b> Ward's triangle densities were reduced from 0. 94 +/- 0. 05 to 0. 86 +/- 0. 11 (p = 0. 007) and from 0. 87 +/- 0. 10 to 0. 74 +/- 0. 14 g. cm- 2 (p = 0. 011), respectively. In Type 1 women, BMD was reduced from 0. 97 +/- 0. 10 to 0. 90 +/- 0. 10 g. cm- 2 (p = 0. 023) in the femoral neck. In <b>Type</b> 2 <b>men,</b> BMD in Ward's triangle was also significantly lower than in controls: 0. 69 +/- 0. 14 vs 0. 76 +/- 0. 19 g. cm- 2, respectively (p = 0. 001).

METHODS: We prospectively analysed <b>set-up</b> <b>and</b> docking times with the da Vinci surgical system in our division. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients were operated on over 30 months in our institution. Median set-up time was 22 (range 9 - 50) min and median docking time was 10 (range 2 - 70) min. Surgeons with previous docking experience were significantly faster than inexperienced surgeons: 8 (range 2 - 50) vs. 17. 5 (range 10 - 70) min. Both <b>set-up</b> <b>and</b> docking showed a fast learning curve.

This was an open-label, flexible dose-escalating study involving 336 men (77 % of whom were Asian/Oriental) enrolled by 15 centres in Australia, Canada and seven countries in Asia. The effective alprostadil dose, ie the dose producing penile rigidity adequate for intercourse and lasting up to 60 min, was established by titration at the clinic prior to entry into the 6 month self-treatment home phase. All men were fully trained in the self-injection technique before entry into the home phase. Efficacy and safety were assessed using patient and partner diaries and by interview at clinic visits during the titration phase and after 1, 3 and 6 months of treatment. An effective home dose was established by titration for 94 % of the 336 men (median dose 20 mug, range 2. 5 - 60 mug). Of 278 (83 %) men who entered the home phase, 277 <b>men</b> (247 with <b>type</b> II diabetes <b>and</b> 30 with <b>type</b> I diabetes) had evaluable data for alprostadil dosage and clinical response. During the home phase, a satisfactory erectile response was achieved after 99 % of injections, and the median alprostadil dose remained unchanged. The initial home dose and clinical response were similar in <b>type</b> I <b>and</b> <b>type</b> II diabetic <b>men.</b> Treatment was generally well tolerated with a low incidence of penile pain (24 %) In conclusion, intracavernosal alprostadil was effective and well tolerated in <b>type</b> I <b>and</b> <b>type</b> II diabetic <b>men</b> with erectile dysfunction of mixed aetiology...|$|R

As a result of the cleavage of several ENG'ases (endoS, endoM, endoD, endoH, and endoLL), the heterogeneous glycans on antibodies were fully transformed into homogeneous-GlcNAc by a combination of endoS, endoD, and endoLL. Next, the desired N-glycans (M 3; Man 3 GlcNAc 1, G 0; GlcNAc 2 Man 3 GlcNAc 1, G 2; Gal 2 GlcNAc 2 Man 3 GlcNAc 1, A 2; NeuAc 2 Gal 2 GlcNAc 2 Man 3 GlcNAc 1) were transferred from the corresponding oxazolines to the GlcNAc residue on the intact anti-Her 2 antibody with an ENG'ase mutant (endoS-D 233 Q), and the glycoengineered anti-Her 2 antibody was obtained. The binding assay of anti-Her 2 antibody with homogenous N-glycans with FcγRIIIa-V 158 showed that the glycoform influenced the affinity for FcγRIIIa-V 158. In addition, the ADCC assay for the glycoengineered anti-Her 2 antibody (mAb-M 3, mAb-G 0, mAb-G 2, and mAb-A 2) was performed using SKBR- 3 and BT- 474 as target cells, and revealed that the glycoform influenced ADCC activity...|$|R
