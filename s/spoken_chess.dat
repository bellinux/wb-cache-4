50|$|Generally <b>speaking,</b> <b>chess</b> {{experts in}} the USSR {{described}} the Soviet School of Chess as a fast-paced, daring style of play best exemplified by the young generation of postwar players like David Bronstein. Not all Soviet players used this playing style, though. The most notable exception was Botvinnik, whom grandmaster Mark Taimanov compared to the methodical Wilhelm Steinitz. The main contribution of the Soviet School of Chess was not the style of players but their emphasis on rigorous training and study of the game, i.e. considering chess a sport rather than an art or science.|$|R
