A legal practitioner representing a party before the EPO must be qualified in an EPC Contracting State, must have his place of business in that State, and must be entitled in that State {{to act as a}} professional representative in patent matters. Both authorised employees and legal practitioners [...] "must file a <b>signed</b> <b>authorisation</b> or a reference to a general authorisation already on file". Subject to these rules, a party has the right to be represented in the manner he chose.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchases}} of the diaries continued throughout {{mid to late}} 1981: Gruner + Jahr gave Heidemann 345,000DMs on 29 July, and a further 220,000DMs a week later, which brought the total up to 1.81millionDMs {{since the start of}} the year. This sum had purchased 18 diaries for the company. Schulte-Hillen, the new managing director, <b>signed</b> an <b>authorisation</b> for a further million DMs for future purchases. Just over two weeks later he <b>signed</b> a further <b>authorisation</b> for 600,000DMs after Heidemann told him that the cost of the diaries had now risen to 200,000DMs each; Heidemann also passed on the news that there were more than 27 diaries.|$|R

25|$|On 19 April 2013, DAP {{secretary-general}} Lim Guan Eng informed all its 51 {{parliament and}} 103 state candidates {{to use the}} rocket symbol first during nomination tomorrow, and show the Election Commission the letter of <b>authorisation</b> <b>signed</b> by secretary-general Lim Guan Eng. If the rocket symbol is rejected, then use the letter of <b>authorisation</b> <b>signed</b> by PAS secretary-general Mustafa Ali for Peninsula Malaysia and PKR letter of authorisation for Sabah and Sarawak. This came after the DAP decided to use PAS and PKR symbols for the coming general election on 5 May.|$|R
25|$|During one {{of these}} attempts, they {{end up on the}} planet Viltvodle VI. Zaphod decides to visit Humma Kavula, his {{opponent}} from the election. Upon learning of Zaphod's plan, Kavula announces that he has the coordinates to Magrathea. He takes one of Zaphod's two heads hostage and demands they bring him the Point-of-View gun created by Deep Thought, which allows the target to understand the shooter's point of view. As they are leaving the planet, Trillian is captured by Vogons. The others travel to rescue her from the Vogon home world bureaucracy, facing long lines and frustrating form processing. Trillian learns of the Earth's destruction, and is outraged to learn that Zaphod <b>signed</b> the <b>authorisation</b> for the destruction of Earth thinking it was a request for an autograph.|$|R
50|$|On 17 May 2010, in a {{televised}} address to the nation, Golding apologised to the Jamaican people for {{his involvement in the}} Manatt affair. He stated that he was prepared to step aside as Prime Minister and leader of the Party in a meeting of the party executive. The executive rejected his offer and reassured their support for his role as party leader and Prime Minister. In his statement, he outlined new measures including assigning some of his portfolio responsibilities to other government Ministers, and a renewed thrust to enact legislation for: the impeachment of parliamentary members, term limits for the office of Prime Minister and political party finance reform. He also confirmed that Attorney General and Minister of Justice Dorothy Lightbourne will <b>sign</b> the <b>authorisation</b> for the US authorities to commence the extradition case against Christopher Coke.|$|R
40|$|The {{business}} use of cloud computing services {{is motivated by}} the ease of use and the potential financial cost reductions. Service failure may occur when the service provider does not protect information or when {{the use of the}} services becomes overly complex and difficult. The benefits also bring optimisation challenges for the information owners who must assess the service security risk {{and the degree to which}} new human behaviours are required. In this research we look at the risk of identity theft when ease of service access is provided through a Single <b>Sign</b> On (SSO) <b>authorisation</b> and ask: What are the optimal behavioural expectations for a Cloud service information owner? Federated identity management is a well-developed design literature for solutions to optimising human behaviours in relation to the new technologies. We briefly review the literature and then propose a working solution that optimises the trade-off between disclosure risk, human user risk and service security. Both breech and non-use of a system are failures...|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, reports {{coming out}} of East Germany were leading to {{heightened}} cold war tensions, as part of which, in West Germany, the Communist Party was becoming increasingly marginalised. In November 1951 a criminal investigation was launched by the West German government against Paul because of his [...] "anti-constitutional politics" [...] ("verfassungsfeindliche Politik"). [...] The West German chancellor <b>signed</b> the <b>authorisation</b> for the process on 20 November 1951 because Paul had [...] "described the West German government as a puppet government and discussed illegal and warlike measures". [...] It was also reported that Paul had been distributing Communist Party leaflets urging supporters that the [...] " ... hour has come for the German People to take responsibility" [...] ("Die Stunde der Verantwortung des deutschen Volkes ist gekommen"). [...] His political agitation had already triggered an application from a regional court to lift his parliamentary immunity two months earlier, in August 1951. [...] At the end of 1951 he reacted by temporarily removing himself across the (still relatively porous) inner German frontier into East Germany. [...] He nevertheless remained {{a member of the}} Bundestag till the end of the parliamentary term, in July 1953, vociferous in opposition to cutting of bread subsidies, and hostile to the Adenauer government's attempt to push through [...] "Anglo-American colonial policies" [...] in West Germany, accusing the government of applying a [...] "divide and rule" [...] strategy. [...] In 1953 he was briefly imprisoned by the West German High Court, citing [...] "high treason" [...] and [...] "endangering the state" [...] apparently in connection with the government process launched {{two and a half years}} earlier.|$|R
50|$|In the salons of Milan he met Laura d'Adda Salvaterra Scaccabarozzi {{who was at}} {{this stage}} married. Some years later, after {{she had become a}} widow, the two of them married one another. In 1859, {{following}} the funeral of Emilio Dandolo the Visconti-Venosta brothers fell under suspicion and took refuge in Piedmont. The manner of their departures differed. Warned by Rosa Bargnani that they were being sought by the authorities, Emiolio headed out of the city without delay, Giovanni decided to stay behind and wait for the delivery of <b>signed</b> emigration <b>authorisations</b> from nearby Brescia. His house {{was the subject of a}} police raid in the night, however. Giovanni fled through a side door and ran for help. His first thought was to go to Costantino Garavaglia, but it turned out he had just been arrested. He fared no better at Carcano's house. He then got hold of Clara Maffei who immediately contacted Carlo Tenca who realised that Visconti Venosta had escaped from his house without taking any money. A few meters further on he reached the house of di Laura d'Adda Salvaterra Scaccabarozzi who was able to provide him with some cash, after which Tenco accompanied the fugitive to beyond the city limits. The most adventurous part of his escape from the territories controlled by the Austrians was the final stretch. Arriving at the frontier, here defined by the Ticino river he came across, by chance, a friend and fellow patriot who knew the local frontier commissioner. There was a project under discussion at the time to extend the local (horse drawn) railway line to the west from Tornavento. Giovanni and his friend had the idea to offer to survey a piece of land that could be used for the line extension. After promising the commissioner to put in a good word for his son, Giovanni obtained the man's permission to undertake a reconnaissance on the far side of the river: he duly crossed, which took him into Piedmont, outside the territory controlled by the Austrians.|$|R
