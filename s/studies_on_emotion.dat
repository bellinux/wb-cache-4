However, what the other party feels might be just as important, as group emotions are known to affect processes both at the group and the personal levels.When it comes to negotiations, trust in the other party is a necessary condition for its emotion to affect, and visibility enhances the effect.Emotions contribute to negotiation processes by signaling what one feels and thinks and can thus prevent the other party from engaging in destructive behaviors and to indicate what steps should be taken next: PA signals to keep in the same way, while NA points that mental or behavioral adjustments are needed.Partner's emotions can have two basic effects on negotiator's emotions and behavior: mimetic/ reciprocal or complementary. For example, disappointment or sadness might lead to compassion and more cooperation. In a study by Butt et al. (2005) that simulated real multi-phase negotiation, most people reacted to the partner's emotions in reciprocal, rather than complementary, manner. Specific emotions were found to have different effects on the opponent's feelings and strategies chosen: ...|$|E

30|$|<b>Studies</b> <b>on</b> <b>emotions</b> can be {{classified}} into i) categorical (discrete emotions) and ii) dimensional. The discrete <b>emotion</b> approach relies <b>on</b> a small set of emotions (e.g., the six basic emotions [28]: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise). The number of the basic emotions differs among theorists. Plutchik [29] distinguished eight basic emotions: fear, anger, sorrow, joy, disgust, acceptance, anticipation, and surprise. Secondary (“non-basic” or “mixed”) emotions are those that cannot be described solely by a basic emotion. For example, “hostility” {{can be defined as}} a mixture of “anger” and “disgust”.|$|R

40|$|Considering the {{relevance}} of the interaction between neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy in the contemporary debate on emotions, this paper aims at establishing a fruitful dialogue between Hegel’s Philosophie des subjektiven Geistes and the most important neuroscientific and psychological research on emotions. By means of an analysis of the role of Empfindungen (sensations) and Gefühle (feelings) in the Enzyklopädie der philosophischen Wissenschaften (1830), we will show that Hegel developed a Theorie des Gefühls. The proposed dialogue between Hegel’s thought and contemporary theories is useful for distinguishing the various types of emotions and their cognitive and affective aspects. In fact, it will emerge that both Hegel and recent <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> consider emotions to be characterized by a cognitive valence which enables a person to orient herself/himself in the world...|$|E
40|$|How power works {{through the}} {{handling}} of emotion of others is analysed by a case example from a <b>study</b> <b>on</b> <b>emotions</b> in organisational change. This case is {{a starting point for}} the theoretical argument that power analysis can benefit from analysing how emotions are engendered as part of power processes, and not merely repressed or controlled. The analysis elaborates and applies the analytical possibilities of the notion of other emotion management, which seems particularly relevant in understanding organisational change, as change increases the amount of emotion work/coping compared to routine situations. I analyse from a perspective <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> that emphasises productive and performative dimensions of emotional life, and this emotional kind of power is distinguished from management of meaning (legitimacy, discourse). Hereby, the paper aims at contributing to a development of power theory and analysis, which has been too cognitively biased. Key words: change, emotion management, power.

40|$|Abstract: Based {{on several}} results related to <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> <b>emotions,</b> {{we suggest that}} the process of emotionrecognition is {{assisted}} by some internal structure of the cognitive images of emotions, which are at different levels of knowledge representation. We concede that the main proposed in psychology models are in correspondence with these levels and in this sense- complementary. We summarize the state-of-the-art of machine emotion recognition with regards of the used psychological models of emotions. In order to discover amelioration sources of multimodal machine emotion recognition, we propose a scheme of the cognitive process, based on gradual levels of representation. The proposed scheme shows several "strategic " differences with the architectures used in machine emotion recognition. We discuss the questions related to recognition, assisted by two levels of representation that we called "perceptual " and "conceptual"...|$|R

40|$|Emotion {{recognition}} in real-life conditions faces several challenging factors, which most <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> recognition do not consider.

Both, natural and spontaneous as well as acted/prototypical emotions are considered. Besides the well known influence of additive noise, a significant influence of the recording level on the recognition performance is observed. Multi-condition learning with various noise types and recording levels is proposed as a way to increase robustness of methods based on standard acoustic feature sets and commonly used classifiers.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Abundant {{research}} has demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia have difficulties in recognizing the emotional content in facial expressions. However, there is a paucity of <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> recognition in schizophrenia patients with a history of violent behavior compared to patients without a criminal record. Methods: Emotion recognition skills were examined in thirty-three forensic patients with schizophrenia. In addition, executive function and psychopathology was assessed. Results were compared to a group of 38 schizophrenia patients in regular psychiatric care and to a healthy control group. Results: Both patient groups performed more poorly on almost all tasks compared to controls. However, in the forensic group the recognition of the expression of disgust was preserved. When the excitement factor of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale was co-varied out, forensic patients outperformed the non-forensic patient group on emotion recognition across modalities. Conclusions: The superior recognition of disgust could be uniquely associated with delinquent behavior...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} role of high self-accountability {{emotions}} in enhancing compliance with fear appeals. In two field experiments, we find that relative to straight fear appeals (negative) or adding hope (positive), which ascribes low accountability to the self, action-facilitative coping, intentions, and behaviors (using sunscreen, eat-ing high fiber foods) are enhanced by adding guilt, regret (both negative), or chal-lenge (positive), all of which induce feelings of high self-accountability. In addition, we find that cold perceptions of high accountability are necessary but insufficient to influence actual behaviors and that the corresponding emotion is an essential driver of behaviors. An appeal used by the Partnership for a Drug FreeAmerica reads, “Smoking pot may not kill you but it will kill your mother, ” an inducement of fear and guilt. In this article, we examine {{the role of}} high self-accountability emotions, such as guilt, in enhancing compliance with fear appeal messages. <b>Studies</b> <b>on</b> <b>emotions</b> have generally taken a valence ap...|$|R
40|$|Elaborating on {{previous}} <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation and deliberate self-harm (DSH), {{in the present}} study we distinguish between strategies of cognitive content (e. g., suicidal cognitions of perceived burdensomeness, helplessness, poor distress tolerance) and cognitive process (e. g., nonacceptance of emotional re-sponses, lack of awareness of emotional responses). Young women who harmed themselves (n = 85) were compared with young women without a history of DSH (n = 93) across a broad range of strategies. Significant group differences were found for all measures, even when depression severity was controlled for. In addi-tion, logistic regression analyses showed that both cognitive content strategies and cognitive process strategies made significant independent contributions to the prediction of group membership. Controlling for depression severity, suicidal cog-nitions, and nonacceptance of emotional responses independently predicted DSH. The strong association between suicidal cognitions and DSH seems to indicate the important role of these cognitions in recurrent and chronic DSH. The strong association between nonacceptance of emotional responses and DSH underscore...|$|E
40|$|In {{research}} on emotion, presenting affective stimuli has been {{believed to be}} an effective and reliable technique for emotion elicitation. Instead of collecting stimuli for pre-defined emotions, we propose to develop stimuli based on their symbolic meanings. We adopted archetypal symbolism as a standard to edit eight movie clips of archetypes as a new set of affective stimuli. These stimuli were used in an experiment for emotion elicitation. Participants ’ emotional responses toward these stimuli of archetypes were measured by the self-report technique and the physiological measurement. The results of linear discriminant analysis show that physiological measurement is more robust than the self-report techniques in recognizing emotions toward stimuli of archetypes. However, it is still unclear which technique reflects the ground truth of human emotion. We discuss alternative implications of these results, and provide more research questions for future <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> <b>emotion</b> recognition and model development.

Peter J. Lang and others showed subjects a series of pictures and asked them to self-rate their emotional response. Ward Winton, Lois Putnam, and Robert Krauss measured heart rate and skin conductance while subjects viewed emotionally evocative stimuli. Dr. Manfred Clynes conducted a series of sentic experiments, gathering data from the vertical and horizontal components of finger pressure. Each of these experiments attempted to quantify emotions and map them into a predictive model of emotion theory. Under the auspices of affective computing, these three models are applied to the interaction between humans and computers. Using a computer to provide the affective stimulus to the human subject, an experiment is conducted which combines all three emotion studies. An ordinary computer mouse was augmented with a sensor to collect senti...|$|E
