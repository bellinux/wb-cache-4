5000|$|The CAPM is a {{model for}} pricing an {{individual}} security or portfolio. For individual securities, we {{make use of the}} <b>security</b> <b>market</b> <b>line</b> (SML) and its relation to expected return and systematic risk (beta) to show how the market must price individual securities in relation to their security risk class. The SML enables us to calculate the reward-to-risk ratio for any security in relation to that of the overall market. Therefore, when the expected rate of return for any security is deflated by its beta coefficient, the reward-to-risk ratio for any individual security in the market is equal to the market reward-to-risk ratio, thus: ...|$|E
5000|$|Where E is the {{expectations}} operator, Ri is the excess {{rate of return}} of the jth asset, Rm is the excess {{rate of return on}} the market, RH is the excess rate of return on aggregate human capital, VH is the value of aggregate human capital and Vm is the market value of traded assets (the market portfolio). In the adjusted CAPM, the beta - the measure of systematic risk - is replaced by an adjusted beta that also accounts for covariance with the portfolio of aggregate human capital. Thus, the model creates a wedge between betas measured against the traded, index portfolio and betas measured against the true market portfolio; the latter also includes human capital (as measured by aggregate labour income). This causes the results to differ in two respects.First, if the Cov(Ri, RH) is positive - as is expected -, the adjusted beta is greater when the CAPM beta is smaller than 1 and vice versa. Thus, it is expected that the risk premium will be greater than predicted by the CAPM for securities with a beta less than one and smaller for securities with a beta greater than 1. This results in a less steep <b>security</b> <b>market</b> <b>line</b> (SML). The ratio of VH¬/Vm may be greater than one and thus likely has a significant economic effect. This may be an explanation for the average negative alpha of high-beta securities and positive alpha of low-beta securities that have been empirically found. [...] Second, in the adjusted CAPM, the portfolios of maximizing investors are not all identical, {{as is the case in}} the original CAPM.|$|E

September 2016, pp. 99 – 107 This study aims at {{investigating}} {{the relationship between}} risk and return for the listed stocks in Palestinian exchange market. Moreover it also examines the validity of capital assets in Palestinian stock market. Thus, ordinary least square (OLS) is used to analyze data variables and to test the research hypotheses. The empirical result reveals that the intercept term of individual companies is insignificantly different from zero and the slope {{is equal to the}} excess return of market index. This result proves significant relationship between risk and return. Moreover, the findings conclude that the higher beta is not associated with higher level of individual stock return. This indicates that the <b>securities</b> <b>market</b> <b>line</b> has non-linearity relationship between risk and return. It means that CAPM is not a good predictor for stock prices in Palestinian exchange market over the selected sample period.

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{empirical}} studies find evidence for systematic deviations from the CAPM.

Other well-documented anomalies are the size premium and the value premium. The CAPM is a special case of the consumption-based CAPM. This study addresses the question whether the consumption-based CAPM with constant relative risk aversion preferences can explain CAPM-anomalies. An example of an economy with power utility and lognormal returns is examined that can be solved in closed form.

40|$|Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} developments in the finance literature. Simply, CAPM is a model that describes the relationship between risk and expected return. The theoretical validity of CAPM is well tested and accepted but the practical validity of CAPM is in questioned. This study is designed to analyze and estimate the portfolio performance of Bangladesh stock market in a CAPM framework. For this study, monthly stock returns from 80 companies for the period of January 2005 to December 2009 are chosen. In order to examine whether the CAPM is satisfied in the portfolio or not, the 80 stocks are arranged in descending order of beta and 10 portfolios are being made of eight stocks in each. The All Share Price Index (DSI) is used as a proxy for the market portfolio and Bangladesh government 3 -Month T-bill rate is used as the proxy for the risk-free asset. The results of this analysis show that the intercept terms are not significantly different from zero, linearity in the <b>securities</b> <b>market</b> <b>line</b> and insignificant unique risk for the 10 portfolios during the period. But, the results in term of slope contradict the CAPM hypothesis and indicate evidence against the CAPM in the portfolios.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{models for}} discount rates that are adjusted for the interest tax shields of an infra-marginal firm {{in a general}} tax equilibrium where there is cross-sectional variation in corporate tax rates. Under {{the assumption that the}} firm optimally maintains a predetermined debt ratio, a tax-adjusted riskless discount rate model is given for valuing certainty-equivalents and a tax-and-risk-adjusted discount rate model is given for valuing expected cash flows. For the latter case, the asset, equity, debt and tax-shield betas are derived and a weighted average cost of capital interpretation is given. The tax-adjusted CAPM/APT <b>security</b> <b>market</b> <b>lines</b> for expected returns in stock and bond markets both have the same slope but different intercepts. A formula is also provided for the present value of the interest tax shield when the firm optimally maintains a predetermined debt level. The analysis here also differs from the existing literature in the following respects: It allows for cross-sectional variation in corporate tax rates and personal tax rates. It shows that the market values of risky and riskless interest tax shields differ {{only to the extent that}} tax laws provide for nonlinear taxation of gains and losses. It also shows that interest tax shields should be discounted at a tax-adjusted discount rate that reflects the fact that they accrue to equity investors, rather than debt investors.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{evolution}} of China's <b>securities</b> <b>market</b> regulation from 1980 to 2007 and the dual role of the government in this process. Design/methodology/approach – When the government is simultaneously the owner and regulator of the <b>securities</b> <b>market,</b> the evolution of <b>securities</b> <b>market</b> regulation follows a path of compulsory institutional change. China's Government authorities have played a dual role in this process by acting both as the <b>securities</b> <b>market</b> regulator and the controlling owner of the stock exchanges.
