5|$|The low status of—and {{subsequent}} discrimination against—women in India can {{be attributed}} to many cultural norms. <b>Societal</b> forces of patriarchy, hierarchy and multigenerational families contribute to Indian gender roles. Men use greater privileges and superior rights to create an unequal society that leaves women with little to no power. This <b>societal</b> structure is exemplified with women’s low participation within India’s national parliament and the labour force.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{has spoken}} {{in favor of}} {{increased}} global participation of women in politics and <b>societal</b> matters in foreign countries.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its vast}} {{government}} {{revenue from the}} mining of petroleum, Nigeria faces a number of <b>societal</b> issues, owing primarily to a history of inefficiency in its governance.|$|E
5|$|Graves of warrior-smiths {{buried with}} weapons and sets of tools were found, which {{suggests}} that they belonged to the <b>societal</b> upper ranks and were held in high esteem.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationships}} of {{ownership of the}} industry, the banking sector and rural property after the nationalization and the land reform were fundamentally altered. The changes, implemented {{in the name of}} egalitarianism, enjoyed broad <b>societal</b> approval and support.|$|E
5|$|A Love Surreal explores {{different}} stages of love in a cycle of slow-burning songs that Bilal deliberately wrote for female listeners. Its songs eschew the personal and <b>societal</b> themes of Airtight's Revenge in favor of upbeat songs about cultivating a romance and meditative laments on its dissolution. Bilal {{wanted to make the}} album sound multidimensional and drew on the surrealist art of Salvador Dalí for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|Although female life {{expectancy}} in Byzantium {{was lower than}} that of men, due to death in childbirth, wars and the fact that men married younger, female widowhood was still fairly common. Still, some women were able to circumvent <b>societal</b> strictures and work as traders, artisans, abbots, entertainers, and scholars.|$|E
5|$|Education of {{families}} {{is critical in}} developing strategies for understanding strengths and weaknesses; helping the family to cope improves outcomes in children. Prognosis may be improved by diagnosis {{at a younger age}} that allows for early interventions, while interventions in adulthood are valuable but less beneficial. There are legal implications for individuals with AS as they run the risk of exploitation by others and may be unable to comprehend the <b>societal</b> implications of their actions.|$|E
5|$|Gil Grissom has a {{more than}} passing {{similarity}} to Sherlock Holmes. Like Holmes, Grissom is dispassionate with a fierce devotion to logic and little regard for <b>societal</b> norms of behavior; Grissom once smashed mustard jars {{in a grocery store}} to illustrate a theory ("I-15 Murders"), much as Holmes once practiced spearing a pig in a butchers to determine how strong a man would have to be to transfix a man with a harpoon.|$|E
5|$|If Curie's work helped {{overturn}} established {{ideas in}} physics and chemistry, {{it has had}} an equally profound effect in the <b>societal</b> sphere. To attain her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, in both her native and her adoptive country, that were placed in her way {{because she was a}} woman. This aspect of her life and career is highlighted in Françoise Giroud's Marie Curie: A Life, which emphasizes Marie's role as a feminist precursor.|$|E
5|$|In May 1890, Maria—who {{retained}} <b>societal</b> {{influence as}} {{the widow of}} a nobleman—persuaded the authorities to allow Lenin to take his exams externally at the University of St Petersburg, where he obtained {{the equivalent of a}} first-class degree with honours. The graduation celebrations were marred when his sister Olga died of typhoid. Lenin remained in Samara for several years, working first as a legal assistant for a regional court and then for a local lawyer. He devoted much time to radical politics, remaining active in Skylarenko's group and formulating ideas about how Marxism applied to Russia. Inspired by Plekhanov's work, Lenin collected data on Russian society, using it to support a Marxist interpretation of <b>societal</b> development and counter the claims of the Narodniks. He wrote a paper on peasant economics; it was rejected by the liberal journal Russian Thought.|$|E
5|$|Leelah Alcorn (November 15, 1997 – December 28, 2014) was an American {{transgender}} {{girl whose}} suicide attracted international attention. Alcorn had posted {{a suicide note}} to her Tumblr blog, writing about <b>societal</b> standards affecting transgender people and expressing the hope that her death would create a dialogue about discrimination, abuse and lack of support for transgender people.|$|E
5|$|Lépine's {{actions have}} been {{variously}} ascribed to psychiatric diagnoses such as personality disorder, psychosis, or attachment disorder, or <b>societal</b> {{factors such as}} poverty, isolation, powerlessness, and violence in the media. The massacre is regarded by criminologists {{as an example of}} a hate crime against women, and by feminists and government officials as misogynist attack and an example of the larger issue of violence against women.|$|E
5|$|Many Aboriginal civilizations {{established}} {{characteristics and}} hallmarks that included permanent urban settlements or cities, agriculture, civic and monumental architecture, and complex <b>societal</b> hierarchies. These cultures had evolved and {{changed by the}} time of the first permanent European arrivals (c. late 15th–early 16th centuries), and have been brought forward through archaeological investigations.|$|E
5|$|Parashurameshvara Temple, {{along with}} Rajarani Temple and Vaital Deula, substantiates the {{existence}} of the Devadasi tradition during the 7th and 8th centuries CE. Devadasis were girls dedicated to worship and service of a deity or a temple {{for the rest of their}} lives and usually enjoyed a high <b>societal</b> status. They were usually transferred to the king's palace and subsequently performed for the general masses.|$|E
5|$|Persona 5 is {{the sixth}} {{entry in the}} main series, {{released}} for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4. It was released in 2016 in Japan, and in 2017 in North America and Europe. Persona 5 is set in Tokyo and follows {{a group of students}} as they adopt the guises of thieves to tackle the city's corruption and attain freedom from imposed <b>societal</b> pressures.|$|E
5|$|Sunni Islam is the {{dominant}} religion in Jordan. Muslims make up about 92% of the country's population; in turn, 93% of those self-identify as Sunnis. There are also {{a small number of}} Ahmadi Muslims, and some Shiites. Many Shia are Iraqi and Lebanese refugees. Muslims who convert to another religion as well as missionaries from other religions face <b>societal</b> and legal discrimination.|$|E
5|$|The Peasants' Revolt was a {{rebellion}} against Egyptian conscription and taxation policies in Palestine. It was a collective {{reaction to the}} gradual elimination of the unofficial rights and privileges previously enjoyed by the various <b>societal</b> groups in the region under Ottoman rule. While the local peasantry constituted {{the bulk of the}} rebel forces, urban notables and Bedouin tribes also formed {{an integral part of the}} revolt.|$|E
5|$|The Song {{justice system}} was {{maintained}} by policing sheriffs, investigators, official coroners, and exam-drafted officials who became county magistrates. Song magistrates {{were encouraged to}} apply both their practical knowledge {{as well as the}} written law in making judicial decisions that would promote <b>societal</b> morality. Advancements in early forensic science, a greater emphasis on gathering credible evidence, and careful recording by clerks of autopsy reports and witness testimonies aided authorities in convicting criminals.|$|E
5|$|The Technical University of Denmark {{is located}} in Lyngby in the {{northern}} outskirts of Copenhagen. In 2013, it was ranked {{as one of the}} leading technical universities in Northern Europe. The IT University is Denmark's youngest university, a mono-faculty institution focusing on technical, <b>societal</b> and business aspects of information technology.|$|E
5|$|The {{architectural}} {{designs of}} these projects have reflected not only the style currents of their time, but the <b>societal</b> debate over the purpose they were intended to serve. Nationalistic ambitions early on gave way to austere designs based on functionalism, and then to designs that emphasized human and ecological needs. To a great extent, Norwegian architects have found {{the opportunity to develop}} their signature styles through these projects, and thereby also a Norwegian architectural dialect.|$|E
5|$|The khap {{passed a}} decree prohibiting {{marriage}} against <b>societal</b> norms. Such caste-based councils {{are common in}} the inner regions of several Indian states, including Haryana, Punjab, western Uttar Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan, and have been operating with government approval for years. In any event, the state government expressed no concern about the ruling of the khap panchayat.|$|E
5|$|Thematically, Chinese {{teachings and}} culture feature {{prominently}} in Kwee's works, in which reincarnation and mysticism are common. Criticism {{of the ethnic}} Chinese in the Indies is also present; Allah jang Palsoe, for instance, criticised the blind pursuit of money while ignoring cultural and <b>societal</b> norms, whilst the stageplay Korbannja Kong Ek criticised {{the management of the}} Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan and its schools.|$|E
5|$|Universal dances in the Philippines {{are found}} at <b>societal</b> {{functions}} such as rituals, mimicry, life cycle and parties. During the Spanish era, most dances are accompanied by Rondalya music usually with 14-string bandurrias that the Filipinos invented or by other type of stringed instruments that locally evolved in to the culture as well.|$|E
5|$|Without {{speaking}} directly of death, both verses {{indicate the}} absence of a loved one, and the narrator's sadness and inability to cope with the grief. In the second verse, the narrator cannot bring himself to come near to his lost love's grave. The effort to avoid the subject of death and the focus on fond memories is typical of songs and <b>societal</b> sensibilities at the time.|$|E
5|$|A Love Surreal {{comprises}} a {{cycle of}} slow-burning songs about different stages of love, including infatuation, seduction, romance, estrangement, longing, renewal, and existential peace. Bilal's intimate lyrics address love's ephemeral nature and how to sustain happiness. It veers between danceable, upbeat songs about cultivating a new romance and bluesy, meditative songs about how romances dissolve. In contrast to Airtight's Revenge, A Love Surreal deals more with feelings of lust and flirting rather than personal and <b>societal</b> issues.|$|E
5|$|According to Freitas, {{direct contact}} with civilizations {{significantly}} more advanced than humanity {{would have to take}} place within the Solar System, as only the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space. Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel. Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass <b>societal</b> shock for humanity.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>societal</b> {{awareness}} of AIDS had developed {{at a slower}} pace in Canada than in the United States, films regarding the disease had appeared nearly concurrently: both the first Canadian documentary and the first American feature-length film on the subject, Nik Sheehan's No Sad Songs and John Erman's An Early Frost respectively, were released in 1985. However, the majority of the early gay artists with AIDS had died by the time Hoolboom made Frank's Cock; as such, the film scholar Thomas Waugh considers Hoolboom a second-generation figurehead in AIDS activism and one of the earliest not coming from the gay community.|$|E
5|$|Amartya Sen’s {{cooperative}} conflicts {{approach to}} gender biases frames women’s gender disadvantage through three different responses: breakdown wellbeing, perceived interest and perceived contribution responses. The breakdown well-being response—derived from the Nash equilibrium—describes breakdown positions between individuals during cooperative decisions. When the breakdown position of one individual {{is less than}} the other person, the solution to any conflict will ultimately result in less favourable conditions for the first individual. In terms of women’s health in India, the overall gender disadvantage facing women—represented by cultural and <b>societal</b> factors that favour men over women—negatively impacts their ability to make decisions with regards to seeking out healthcare.|$|E
5|$|An {{internal}} {{attempt was}} made to discredit Gomułka's leadership, but there were aspects of the ongoing witch hunt which he found to be to his advantage and he tolerated it until the <b>societal</b> damage wrecked by the Moczar movement had become irreversible. Gomułka's regime reasserted itself and was saved by a combination of international and domestic factors, including the Moczar faction's inability to take over the party and state apparatus. The Soviet Union, now led by Leonid Brezhnev, was preoccupied with the crisis in Czechoslovakia and not inclined to support personal changes in the Polish leadership.|$|E
5|$|Before year 2000 some survivalists wrongly {{believed}} this process {{would be set}} in motion by the predicted Y2K problem causing <b>societal</b> collapse. Since many left-wing and right-wing conspiracy theorists believe that the September 11 attacks were a false flag operation carried out by the United States intelligence community, as part of a strategy of tension to justify political repression at home and preemptive war abroad, they have become convinced that a more catastrophic terrorist incident will be responsible for triggering Executive Directive 51 in order to complete the transition to a police state.|$|E
5|$|Bruno Alfred Döblin {{was born}} on 10 August 1878 at the house at Bollwerk 37 in Stettin (Szczecin), a port city {{in what was then}} the Province of Pomerania. He was the fourth of five {{children}} born to Max Döblin (1846–1921), a master tailor from Posen (Poznań), and Sophie Döblin (1844–1920), née Freudenheim, the daughter of a merchant. Their marriage was characterized by a tension between Max's multifaceted artistic interests—to which Döblin would later attribute his and his siblings' artistic inclinations—and Sophie's cool pragmatism. The Döblins were assimilated Jews, and Alfred became aware of a broad, <b>societal</b> anti-Semitism early on.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, heart disease had surpassed {{infectious}} disease as {{the leading cause of death}} in the United States, and it is currently the leading cause of deaths worldwide. Since 1948, the ongoing Framingham Heart Study has shed light on the effects of various influences on the heart, including diet, exercise, and common medications such as aspirin. Although the introduction of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers has improved the management of chronic heart failure, the disease continues to be an enormous medical and <b>societal</b> burden, with 30 to 40% of patients dying within a year of receiving the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It is also possible that he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as <b>societal</b> gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{discovery}} of many hundreds of Iron Age sites in Scotland {{there is still a}} great deal that remains to be explained {{about the nature of the}} Celtic life in the early Christian era. Unfortunately radiocarbon dating for this period is problematic and chronological sequences are poorly understood. For a variety of reasons much of the archaeological work to date in Scotland has concentrated on the islands of the west and north and both excavations and analysis of <b>societal</b> structures on the mainland are more limited in scope.|$|E
5|$|Dickens {{returned}} to the tale several times during his life to amend the phrasing and punctuation. He capitalised {{on the success of}} the book by publishing other Christmas stories The Chimes (1844), The Cricket on the Hearth (1845), The Battle of Life (1846) and The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain (1848); these were secular conversion tales which reflected the <b>societal</b> changes of the previous year, and which social problems still needed to be dealt with. While the public eagerly bought the later books, the reviewers were highly critical of the stories.|$|E
