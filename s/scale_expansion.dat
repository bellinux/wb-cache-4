40|$|The Lagrangian {{trajectories of}} {{neutrally}} buoyant particles underneath surface gravity wave groups are dictated by two physical phenomena: the Stokes drift {{results in a}} net displacement of particles {{in the direction of}} propagation of the group, whereas the Eulerian return flow, as described by the multi-chromatic wave theory of Longuet-Higgins and Stewart (1962), transports such particles in the opposite direction. By pursuing a separation of <b>scales</b> <b>expansion,</b> we develop simple closed-form expressions for the net Lagrangian displacement of particles.
