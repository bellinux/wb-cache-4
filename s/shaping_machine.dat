50|$|There are {{two types}} of splines, {{internal}} and external. External splines may be broached, shaped (for example on a gear <b>shaping</b> <b>machine),</b> milled, hobbed, rolled, ground or extruded. There are fewer methods available for manufacturing internal splines due to accessibility restrictions. Methods include those listed above with the exception of hobbing (no access). Often, with internal splines, the splined portion of the part may not have a through-hole, which precludes use of a pull / push broach or extrusion-type method. Also, if the part is small {{it may be difficult to}} fit a milling or grinding tool into the area where the splines are machined.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the success}} of his power loom, in 1825 he invented a {{slotting}} machine to cut keyways in gears and pulleys to fasten them to their shafts. [...] Previously this was done by hand chipping and filing. The tool was reciprocated vertically, and by adopting Maudslay's slide rest principle, he made the work table with a universal movement, both straight line and rotary so that the sides of complex pieces could be machined. Later he developed the <b>shaping</b> <b>machine,</b> where the cutting tool was reciprocated horizontally over the work, which could be moved in all directions by means of screw-driven slides. Examples of his machine tools, including the oldest existing metal planer, are in the collections of the National Museum of Science and Industry, London. Roberts also manufactured and sold sets of stocks and dies to his range of pitches, so other engineers could cut threads on nuts and bolts and other machine parts.|$|E
