40|$|An {{alternative}} {{space suit}} insulation concept using a monolayer woven pile material is discussed. The material reduces cost and improves {{the durability of}} the overgarment, while providing protection similar to that provided by multilayer insulation (MLI). Twelve samples of different configurations were fabricated and tested for compressibility and thermal conductivity {{as a function of}} compression loading. Two samples which showed good results in the initial tests were further tested for thermal conductivity with respect to ambient pressure and temperature. Results of these tests were similar to results of the MLI tests, indicating the potential of the monolayer fabric to replace the present MLI. A seaming study illustrated that the fabric can be sewn in a structurally <b>sound</b> <b>seam</b> with minimal heat loss. It is recommended that a prototype thermal meteroid garment be fabricated...|$|E
5000|$|The mid-1980s pop {{rock bands}} Amajlija, Poslednja Igra Leptira, Divlji Anđeli, Slomljena Stakla, Ruž, Alisa, Banana, Jugosloveni, Bel Tempo and Vampiri had {{a vast number}} of album sales, however, the {{majority}} of them disbanded before reaching the 1990s, or {{at the very beginning of}} the decade. Poslednja Igra Leptira, formed in 1980 and led by charismatic frontman Nenad Radulović, also known as Neša Leptir, achieved success with their pop rock songs with humorous lyrics, but disbanded in 1989. Radulović released his solo album Niko nema što piton imade, which parodied [...] "novokomponovana muzika", in 1989, before dying of tumor in 1990. Bel Tempo, formed in 1986 by brother and sister Vlada and Suzana Petričević, released two pop rock albums with jazz elements before disbanding in 1992. Vampiri's sound was influenced by the 1950s doo-wop and rockabilly. However, with the breakout of the Yugoslav Wars, their <b>sound</b> <b>seamed</b> misplaced and the band disbanded in 1993. They reunited in 1995 and released the album Plavi grad, and, in 1997, Monkey Food, experimenting with different musical genres on the latter. However, the band disbanded once again in 1998.|$|R
40|$|In hollow {{aluminium}} extrusions, longitudinal weld-seams {{are formed}} through a solid-state bonding process at elevated temperatures and {{under conditions of}} interfacial pressure and plastic deformation. For structurally loaded components, <b>sound</b> weld <b>seams</b> are imperative. In our research, a weld seam integrity indicator {{as a means of}} quantifying bonding efficiency is introduced and the feasibility of this concept is investigated by means of lab-scale experiments. Characterisation of these weld seams through mechanical testing, provides a basis for an estimation of the weld seam indicator introduced in this paper, thus demonstrating the feasibility of this concept...|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} achieve this effect, a seam bowler usually {{delivers}} the ball with the seam held upright, with rotation about a horizontal axis. This keeps the seam aligned vertically as it travels towards the batsman, making it likely that the ball will bounce with the seam on the pitch. Of course, consistently hitting the seam is {{not as easy as}} it <b>sounds.</b> The <b>seam</b> has to be held upright between the index finger and the middle finger {{at the time of the}} delivery of the ball and, most importantly, the wrist has to be dead straight when the ball is delivered. The seam and wrist position of Australia's Glenn McGrath are arguably a perfect example.|$|R
40|$|Process gas {{plays an}} {{important}} role for getting <b>sound</b> weld <b>seams.</b> Whereas in conventional welding techniques process gas mainly is used as shielding gas, for preventing the weld bead from oxidation, in laser beam welding process gas in addition is needed for control of the laser induced plasma. For that purpose inert gas helium is the most efficient but most expensive one. The use of other process gases than helium in laser beam welding can produce plasma shieling and in consequence process interruption caused by fluctuations in process or production parameters. This paper presents a method of control called PSC (plasma shielding control) that avoids the formation of strong plasma shielding. In aluminium welding PSC opens a range of process gas application with improvement of process efficiency and weld seam quality. In welding steel PSC is able to reduce gas costs...|$|R
40|$|In {{the serial}} {{production}} of components for automotive {{applications such as}} cooling and air-conditioning systems, aluminum die-cast materials are frequently used due to their excellent castability. The aim of providing light weight components can be approached with thin walled cross sections even for complex structural parts. However, cast components are usually connected to semifinished products such as profiles or tubes. The connections have to be mostly pressure tight. The joining technique for these applications has to be highly productive to obtain high component outcome and cost-efficient. Laser beam welding techniques are especially suitable for these tasks. Die-cast components have limited or no weldability due to their manufacturing process. This is due to entrapped gases within pores or cavities under high pressure conditions. Furthermore, the mold release agents for the die-cast process are inappropriate for obtaining homogeneous and <b>sound</b> weld <b>seams.</b> Consequently, {{this results in a}} larger number of pores in the weld seam and stochastic melt pool blow-outs, which prohibit mostly the use of the component. To solve these issues, a new welding technique, remoweld®T, has been developed at Fraunhofer IWS. This unique method has been extensively tested and used for serial-production. The decisive step was to use laser sources with brilliant beam quality in combination with a high frequency beam oscillation within the melt pool. In this paper, the technological approach will be presented. With the remoweld®T method, it was possible to obtain homogeneous weld seams with low porosity and a strongly reduced distortion for the first time. Minor component tolerances and a reproducible joining technique with a high output for serial production can be achieved...|$|R
