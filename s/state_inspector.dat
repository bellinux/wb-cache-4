One California <b>State</b> <b>Inspector,</b> Earl Willis, 51, managed to escape into a nearby bank located there on Washington Street as a now fuming Alexander chased after him down the block, which was recorded on camcorder by the proprietor {{of one of the}} nearby businesses. After Alexander's failed attempt to shoot Willis, he immediately went back to his linguisa factory lobby and emptied three more shots into the heads of the victims, making sure that they were dead. The police would soon finally arrive upon the scene within a few minutes only after someone in the bank notified the police department; they would arrive to see a waiting Alexander standing in front of his factory, admitting to the murders and ready to be taken into custody.|$|E

25|$|Controversy erupted {{before the}} fight when Mosley's trainer, Naazim Richardson, {{observed}} that Margarito had a pasty white substance in his handwraps. One doctor described this material as plaster {{hidden in the}} wrapped hands of Margarito, leading to accusations {{that he may have}} been trying to cheat. At Richardson's insistence, California <b>State</b> <b>Inspector</b> Dean Lohuis called for Margarito's hands to be rewrapped. According to Judd Burstein, the attorney for Mosley, Margarito had wet pads in the wrapping. Mosley's doctor, Robert Olvera, likened the material to the type of plaster used to make casts. Burstein said he seized the pad removed from the wrapping and another pad found in Margarito's dressing room. Both were placed in a sealed box that was given to Lohuis for further study. The California Department of Justice laboratory later confirmed the substance to be similar in nature to plaster of Paris.|$|E
