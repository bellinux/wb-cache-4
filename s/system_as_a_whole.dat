5|$|On Earth, thorium is {{much more}} abundant: with an {{abundance}} of 8.1parts per million (ppm) in the Earth's crust, {{it is one of the}} most abundant of the heavy elements, almost as abundant as lead (13ppm) and more abundant than tin (2.1ppm). This is because thorium is likely to form oxide minerals that do not sink into the core; it is classified as a lithophile. Common thorium compounds are also poorly soluble in water. Thus, even though the Earth contains the same abundances of the elements as the Solar <b>System</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> there is more accessible thorium than heavy platinum group metals in the crust.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} is a chaotic system.

Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather {{more than a few days}} in advance, weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after {{reaching}} its peak intensity, Debby encountered {{an area of}} dry air, and subsequently weakened. The low level circulation detached itself from the diminishing convection while the <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> continued west-northwestward.

Southerly wind shear displaced the convection {{to the north of the}} center, and Debby weakened to a minimal tropical storm on August 25. The center of the storm became asymmetric and elongated, and on August 26 Debby weakened to a tropical depression. Convection remained minimal and it quickly degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure. The low turned to the north and north-northeast ahead of an approaching trough, and on August 28 the low dissipated.|$|E
