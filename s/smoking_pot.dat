500|$|Nardine Saad from Los Angeles Times {{noted that}} the video [...] "briefly makes us {{sympathetic}} toward the Biebs and his eyebrow-raising behavior this last year, which has included speeding, possibly <b>smoking</b> <b>pot</b> and frequently walking around shirtless" [...] and named the fans' part [...] "memorable". The same noted Ryan Seacrest's website, saying [...] "proves that no matter where he goes, {{there will always be}} plenty of fans to support him". Entertainment Weekly notes that it [...] "show off Justin Bieber in an all-white suit and in a leather-jacket outfit.

500|$|The album's {{title is}} {{intended}} to reference Top 40 radio stations, and the tracks reflect a straightforward country-rock sound. The band members felt {{that they needed to}} establish themselves outside of the Tupelo fanbase. However, Tweedy later stated that in actuality, they were [...] "trying to tread some water with a perceived audience." [...] Tweedy wrote a song about the Uncle Tupelo breakup, but decided that he didn't want any material on that subject matter to appear on the album. (It can be argued, however, that first single [...] "Box Full of Letters", as well as [...] "Too Far Apart" [...] allude to the dissolution of Farrar and Tweedy's friendship and working relationship.) Critic and author Greg Kot wrote in [...] that [...] "Tweedy's voice and personality are as modest as the arrangements; there's little sense of drama, and virtually no hint of risk. Tweedy attributes some of the straightforwardness of the album to his abuse of marijuana at the time. Shortly after the album, Tweedy stopped <b>smoking</b> <b>pot,</b> to which he credits the introspectiveness of further albums.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, a Swedish court fined McCartney £1,000 for {{cannabis}} possession. Soon after, Scottish {{police found}} marijuana plants growing on his farm, leading to his 1973 conviction for illegal cultivation and a £100 fine. As {{a result of}} his drug convictions, the US government repeatedly denied him a visa until December 1973. Arrested again for marijuana possession in 1975, in Los Angeles, Linda took the blame, and the court soon dismissed the charges. In January 1980, when Wings flew to Tokyo for a tour of Japan, customs officials found approximately 8ounces (200g) of cannabis in his luggage. They arrested McCartney and brought him to a local jail while the Japanese government decided what to do. After ten days, they released and deported him without charge. In 1984, while McCartney was on holiday in Barbados, authorities arrested him for possession of marijuana and fined him $200. Upon his return to England, he stated: [...] "cannabis is... less harmful than rum punch, whiskey, nicotine and glue, all of which are perfectly legal... I don't think... I was doing anyone any harm whatsoever." [...] In 1997, he spoke out in support of decriminalisation of the drug: [...] "People are <b>smoking</b> <b>pot</b> anyway and to make them criminals is wrong." [...] He did however, decide to quit cannabis in 2015, citing a desire to set a good example for his grandchildren.|$|E
