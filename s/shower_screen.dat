50|$|Hitchcock Hotel: The {{players were}} locked into 4 {{different}} rooms {{and had to}} escape with a name (Alfred Hitchcock). Inside each room was a safe and a mobile phone {{with each of the}} player's numbers on it. Also in the rooms were different clues - an exercise bicycle in Michael's room, a video tape inside a VCR in Mal's, a safe combination on a <b>shower</b> <b>screen</b> in Brooke's, and pieces of paper with writing in Hal's. Hal's room was completely void of light, yet that room contained the keys to open that room's door. If the players figured out the name and escape on time, they would win. They easily discerned the name they were supposed to give the host upon escaping (the clues that led to their escape centered around Hitchcock films, and every room in the hotel was named for a Hitchcock film), but were a few minutes outside of their hour time limit in getting out, so nothing was won.|$|E
