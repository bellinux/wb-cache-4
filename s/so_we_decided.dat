'Paper Hearts' never ultimately answers the question. We've had people come up to us and say, 'Okay, so we know she's really dead, so what happened?' <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> in this one to answer the question."

Pavement had its start playing at open mike nights at clubs and bars.

Malkmus recalls, [...] "It was pretty reasonable {{to be able to}} make a single for $1,000, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> to go for it. We didn't have any real plans because we weren't a real band." [...] Two local studios existed in Stockton, the cheaper and less professionally minded of which was Gary Young's Louder Than You Think Studio. The band decided to record at Young's studio due to their admiration of other local punk bands who had recorded there, including The Young Pioneers and The Authorities. Kannberg reportedly borrowed $800 from his father to record Slay Tracks.|$|E

The song's recording was commenced at ACME Recording, Long Island, California, and at Ollywood Studios, Hollywood, California, by Gamson. Kesha told Rolling Stone that Stephen was one of her favorite tracks on the album. She explained that the song stemmed from her experiences with a man that she had been [...] "stalking since [...] was 15." [...] It was written when the singer was sixteen, in collaboration with her mother. She found David Gamson to produce the song.

After completing twenty songs, the rough demo master tapes were stolen that November. The musicians insisted they had no leads on its whereabouts until 2016, when during an interview with NME Armstrong and Dirnt stated that they eventually recovered the material, and that the band is now using the tapes for ideas. The band consulted longtime producer Rob Cavallo about what to do next. Cavallo told the members to ask themselves if the missing tracks represented the group's best work. Armstrong said that the band members [...] "couldn't honestly look at ourselves and say, 'That was the best thing we've ever done.' <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> to move on and do something completely new."

Refraining from paying for a studio drummer, he invited Barker to record drums on the project, which led Hoppus to feel betrayed.
