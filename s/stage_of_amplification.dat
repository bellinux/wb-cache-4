40|$|Piezoelectric devices, e. g. {{piezoelectric}} stack actuators, {{have several}} salient features inherent to their structure. They are efficient, {{have a high}} bandwidth, and their capacitive loading allows for static loads to be maintained with virtually no power consumption. The major preventative drawback that limits more widespread use is the small strain, {{on the order of}} 0. 1 %. For marco-scale applications, the displacement must be amplified, typically through mechanical or frequency leveraging. Both have inherent limitations: mechanical devices can increase the stroke but is naturally limited; and frequency devices relies on friction and is limited to nanopositioning. In this thesis, we investigate combining a unique mechanical amplification with a frequency amplification device that does not rely on friction to produce an arbitrarily large stroke linear actuator. The first <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>amplification</b> aims to achieve the greatest displacement amplification without sacrificing force capabilities. The second stage relies on the coordinated actuation of multiple copies of the mechanically amplified device to produce a long stroke, smooth force poly-actuator. The theoretical design concepts for each <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>amplification</b> are explicitly derived. The mechanical amplification device uses rolling contact joints to maintain stiff connections to transmit the force without losses due to friction; and the frequency amplification uses a sinusoidal Transmission interface to exploit a passive balancing of undesirable non-linearities, proven by harmonic analysis. A unique control algorithm is developed to produce a wide variety of capabilities. The theoretical findings are supported by experimental prototypes. The mechanical amplification device produces a comparable energy density while amplifying the displacement by an additional factor 10. The proof-of-concept poly-actuator prototype can continually produce +/- 100 Newtons of force over a stroke of 200 mm.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a scheme for pump-probe experiments {{that can be}} performed at LCLS and at the European XFEL and determines what additional hardware development {{will be required to}} bring these experiments to fruition.

An important feature of the proposed scheme is that the hardware requirement is minimal. Our technique is based in essence on the "fresh" bunch technique.

Drawings are being made of these units. By the time these units had been completed, the amplifier of the scaler was modified so that its frequency response was essentially flat up to 4. 5 megacycles. Using this amplifier and the cathode-follower, a study of the pulse shapes was made and four different pulse shapes were found to be obtainable. A band pass network between the B-wall tube and the input of the cathode-follower provided a very substantial improvement over the shunt peaking network with a band pass of 1. 8 to 6. 5 megacycles and provided clean, uniform pulses. Plans are being made to experiment with a filter of narrower band pass, which, if satisfactory, will produce greater amplitude. When the final band pass has been determined, a combination of shunt peaking and band pass networks should provide a net gain of 30 % in amplitude. The result of this research is to provide an immediate improvement in resolution loss and a possibility of realizing a still lower minimum resolving time when the other components in the counting system have been improved.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the binding of guanyl {{nucleotides}} to retinal rod outer segment membranes to determine how light activates a cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase and a GTPase. We found that rod outer segment membranes contain tightly bound radioactive GDP after incubation in the dark with [3 H]GDP or [alpha- 32 P]GTP. Reconstituted membranes containing only rhodopsin and phospholipid bind almost no GDP. More than 80 % of the radioactive GDP bound to rod outer segment membranes could be released by subsequent illumination. At low light levels, the rate and extent of GDP release were markedly enhanced {{by the presence of}} GTP or p[NH]ppG, a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP. The kinetics of binding of p[NH]ppG paralleled the kinetics of release of bound GDP, indicating that p[NH]ppG was exchanged for bound GDP. The maximal amount of bound p[NH]ppG was 1 per 30 rhodopsins when photolyzed membranes were incubated with 10 micro M nucleotide. Under these conditions, p[NH]ppG binding was half-maximal when only 1 in 90, 000 rhodopsins was photolyzed. This corresponds to the catalyzed exchange of 500 p[NH]ppG for bound GDP per photolyzed rhodopsin. We propose a light-activated GTP-GDP amplification cycle involving a guanyl nucleotide binding protein with GTPase activity (E). The essence of this cycle is that photolyzed rhodopsin catalyzes the formation of E. GTP from E. GDP (the major species in the dark) by nucleotide exchange. The formation of several hundred E.

It is also shown analytically that, in spite of the well-known drop for the exact magnetoresonance, the gain attains its maximal value in the zone of regular dynamics slightly above the magnetoresonant value of the guide magnetic field. Under the condition of undulator resonance, it is practically independent of the amplitude of the undulator magnetic field and the wavelength of amplified signal. To account for space-charge effects, we propose a theoretical model of a weakly relativistic FEM, which accommodates not only potential but also rotational parts of the nonradiated electromagnetic field of a moving charged particle. It turns out that the rotational part of nonradiated field diminishes the defocusing influence of the potential part on the beam bunching. Numeric simulation of the nonlinear <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>amplification</b> is fulfilled, taking into consideration adiabatic entrance of the electron beam to the interaction region and initial electron velocity spread.
