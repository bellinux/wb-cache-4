5|$|A stone coffin {{found during}} the 2012 {{excavation}} was opened {{for the first}} time, revealing a lead coffin inside.

The skeleton was at first assumed to be male, perhaps that of a knight called Sir William de Moton who was known to have been buried there, but later examination <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> to be of a woman—perhaps a high-ranking benefactress. She may not necessarily have been local, as lead coffins were used to transport corpses over long distances.|$|E
5|$|An {{isolated}} {{population in}} the Laptev Sea is considered by some authorities, including many Russian biologists and the canonical Mammal Species of the World, to be a third subspecies, O. r. laptevi (Chapskii, 1940), and is managed as such in Russia. Where the subspecies separation is not accepted, whether to consider it a subpopulation of the Atlantic or Pacific subspecies remained under debate until 2009, when multiple lines of molecular evidence <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> to represent the westernmost population of the Pacific walrus.|$|E

5|$|His first {{project for}} Webb and Knapp was an {{apartment}} building with funding from the Housing Act of 1949. Pei's design {{was based on a}} circular tower with concentric rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation; the apartments themselves were located toward the outer edge. Zeckendorf loved the design and even <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> off to Le Corbusier when they met. The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never moved beyond the model stage.|$|E

Our respect for the dead, when they are just dead, is something wonderful, and the way we <b>show</b> <b>it</b> more wonderful still. We <b>show</b> <b>it</b> with black feathers and black horses; we <b>show</b> <b>it</b> with black dresses and bright heraldries; we <b>show</b> <b>it</b> with costly obelisks and sculptures of sorrow, which spoil half of our most beautiful cathedrals. We <b>show</b> <b>it</b> with frightful gratings and vaults, and lids of dismal stone, {{in the midst of the}} quiet grass; and last, and not least, we <b>show</b> <b>it</b> by permitting ourselves to tell any number of lies we think amiable or credible, in the epitaph. This feeling is common to the poor as well as the rich; and we all know how many a poor family will nearly ruin themselves, to testify their respect for some member of it in his coffin, whom they never much cared for when he was out of it; and how often it happens that a poor old woman will starve herself to death, in order that she may be respectably buried.|$|R

Laboratory experiments <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> increased tone of guinea pig smooth muscle of the small bowel (ileum), and that when given to rats, it led to mydriasis, skeletal muscle weakness, and central nervous system depression. Turbinellus floccosus contains more than double the amount of this acid than the related T. kauffmanii.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} trace {{elements}} in mushrooms {{in the eastern}} Black Sea Region of Turkey found E.sinuatum to have {{the highest levels of}} copper (64.8 ± 5.9μg/g dried material—insufficient to be toxic) and zinc (198μg/g) recorded. Caps and stalks tested in an area with high levels of mercury in southeastern Poland <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> to bioaccumulate much higher levels of mercury than other fungi. The element was also found in high levels in the humus-rich substrate. Entoloma sinuatum also accumulates arsenic-containing compounds. Of the roughly 40μg of arsenic present per gram of fresh mushroom tissue, about 8% was arsenite and the other 92% was arsenate.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a legend}} {{recorded}} in the Greek hagiography, Jovan Vladimir built the church near Elbasan. Its location, deep in a dense forest, was chosen by God, and an eagle with a shining cross on its head <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> to Vladimir. After the saint was decapitated, he brought {{his head to the}} church, and was buried inside. A group of Franks once stole the casket with his miraculous relics. The casket turned out to be extremely heavy, breaking the backs of hinnies on which the Franks carried it. They eventually put it in the Shkumbin River {{to take it to the}} sea, but the river flooded, and the casket—radiating light—went back upstream toward the church. The inhabitants of that area took it out of the water and returned it to the church in a festive procession.|$|E

5|$|According to {{literary}} critics Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier, possible fictional influences on Hergé's story include Jules Verne's 1870 novel Around the Moon and the 1950 American film Destination Moon. Hergé was certainly {{inspired by a}} number of photographic stills from the Destination Moon film which had been published. The computer system at the Sprodj space centre was visually based upon the UNIVAC I, the first computer to be created for non-military purposes. Hergé based his moon rocket on the designs of the V-2 rocket which had been developed by German scientists during World War II. The red-and-white checker pattern on Hergé's rocket was based upon an illustration of a V-2 which Hergé had come upon in Leslie Simon's 1947 book German Research in World War II. He commissioned the construction of a model rocket with detachable parts from his assistant Arthur Van Noeyen. He took the model to Paris where he <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> to Ananoff, asking him if it was a realistic representation of what a moon rocket might look like. He and his assistants then used the model from which to accurately sketch when producing the comic.|$|E

Hoffman received the script and <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> to his partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules. It was decided that, with some changes, it could be made into Saw II. Whannell became available to provide rewrites of the script. The film was given a larger budget and was shot from May to June 2005 in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Andrée ignored many {{early signs}} of the dangers {{associated}} with his balloon plan. Being able to steer the balloon to some extent was essential for a safe journey, and {{there was plenty of}} evidence that the drag-rope steering technique he had invented was ineffective; yet he staked the fate of the expedition on drag ropes. Worse, the polar balloon Örnen (The Eagle) was delivered directly to Svalbard from its manufacturer in Paris without being tested; when measurements <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> to be leaking more than expected, Andrée refused to acknowledge the alarming implications. Most modern students of the expedition see Andrée's optimism, faith in the power of technology, and disregard for the forces of nature as the main factors in the series of events that led to his death and those of his two companions Nils Strindberg (1872–97) and Knut Frænkel (1870–97).|$|E
