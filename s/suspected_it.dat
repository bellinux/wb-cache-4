5|$|In 1942, a 3-hour {{power outage}} caused by testing of new {{distribution}} circuits affected seven major factories producing material for World War II. These included the Grumman plant in Bethpage and the Republic Aviation plant in Farmingdale, where workers staged an impromptu baseball game {{while they waited}} for power to return. Local hospitals and Mitchel Field were able to continue operating under auxiliary power. Although sabotage was not <b>suspected,</b> <b>it</b> caused the colonel in charge of civilian protection for Nassau County to request that the Army guard the power station.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid {{has been}} studied as an {{alternative}} to vancomycin in the treatment of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients when Gram-positive infection is <b>suspected.</b> <b>It</b> is also one of few antibiotics that diffuse into the vitreous humor, and may therefore be effective in treating endophthalmitis (inflammation of the inner linings and cavities of the eye) caused by susceptible bacteria. Again, there is little evidence for its use in this setting, as infectious endophthalmitis is treated widely and effectively with vancomycin injected directly into the eye.|$|E
5|$|Most of the gumfields were in Northland, Coromandel and Auckland, {{the site}} of the {{original}} kauri forests. Initially, the gum was readily accessible, commonly found lying on the ground. Captain Cook reported the presence of resinous lumps on the beach at Mercury Bay, Coromandel, in 1769, although he <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> came from the mangroves, and missionary Samuel Marsden spoke of their presence in Northland in 1819.|$|E

5|$|In April , Sid Sheinberg, a {{seasoned}} lawyer {{and president of}} MCA and Universal City Studios, learned of the game's success and <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> might be a trademark infringement of Universal's own King Kong. On April 27, 1982, he met with Arnold Greenberg of Coleco and threatened to sue over Coleco's home version of Donkey Kong. Coleco agreed on May 3, 1982 to pay royalties to Universal of 3% of their Donkey Kongs net sale price, worth about $4.6 million. Meanwhile, Sheinberg revoked Tiger's license to make its King Kong game, but O. R. Rissman refused to acknowledge Universal's claim to the trademark. When Universal threatened Nintendo, Howard Lincoln and Nintendo refused to cave. In preparation for the court battle ahead, Universal agreed to allow Tiger to continue producing its King Kong game {{as long as they}} distinguished it from Donkey Kong.|$|E
5|$|Folklorist John F. Campbell noted a {{story told}} on Islay, {{one of the}} Inner Hebridean islands, which {{demonstrates}} the usefulness of having a water bull. Just after a calf was born to an ordinary cow, an elderly lady, later identified as a witch, advised the herdsman to keep it separate from the other cattle, presumably after she noticed its deformed ears and <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> was a water bull. She instructed the herdsman to rear the calf on milk from three different cows and to keep it confined in a stable {{for a minimum of}} seven years. Years later, a young woman was grazing cattle at a nearby loch when she was approached by an attractive man. He struck up a conversation with her and shortly afterwards the pair sat on the grass with his head resting in her lap, but as he fell asleep she discovered seaweed entwined in his hair, a sign that he was a water horse. She started to run back to the farm. Her suitor awoke, shapeshifted into his true equine form and chased after her. As the woman ran towards the farm, the witch shouted to the herdsman to release the water bull from the stable. The two creatures fought until they fell into the sea. The water horse never returned, but the remains of the bull were found the following day.|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday 3 April 1888, {{following}} the Easter Monday bank holiday, prostitute Emma Elizabeth Smith was assaulted and robbed {{at the junction}} of Osborn Street and Brick Lane, Whitechapel, {{in the early hours}} of the morning. Although injured, she survived the attack and managed to walk back to her lodging house at 18 George Street, Spitalfields. She told the deputy keeper, Mary Russell, that she had been attacked by two or three men, one of them a youth. Mrs Russell took Smith to the London Hospital, where medical examination revealed that a blunt object had been inserted into her vagina, rupturing her peritoneum. She developed peritonitis and died at 9am on 4 April 1888. The inquest was conducted on 7 April by the coroner for East Middlesex, Wynne Edwin Baxter, who also conducted inquests on six of the later victims. The local inspector of the Metropolitan Police, Edmund Reid of H Division Whitechapel, investigated the attack but the culprits were never caught. Walter Dew, a detective constable stationed with H Division, later wrote that he thought Smith was the first victim of Jack the Ripper, but his colleagues <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> was the work of a criminal gang. Smith claimed that she was attacked by a group of men, but either refused to or could not describe them. Prostitutes were often managed by gangs, and Smith could have been attacked by her pimps as a punishment for disobeying them, or as part of their intimidation. She may not have identified her attackers because she feared reprisal, and her murder is unlikely to be connected with the later killings.|$|E

25|$|While {{centered}} on the Plain of Jars, FAN raised a Special Guerrilla Battalion that occupied Vang Khy, a village located between Vientiane and Vang Viang. While the reputed purpose of the new battalion was security for Neutralist officials in the capital, the Royalist General Staff <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> was actually a potential coup force. In December 1963, its commanding officer was murdered in Vientiane. A Royalist assassination was presumed.|$|E
25|$|The general end of {{hostilities}} unfortunately {{did not mean}} the end of casualties for the 8th Armored. On 1 May the 58th Inf. lost two men to snipers who had to be killed since they would not surrender.

25|$|Such was {{the lack}} of warning that {{there was no time to}} engage in {{defensive}} manoeuvres, leading to a change in British policy whereby any Royal Navy vessel that <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> might be under missile attack would turn toward the threat, accelerate to maximum speed and fire chaff to prevent a ship being caught defenceless again. The codeword used to start this procedure was 'handbrake', which had to be broadcast once the signal of the Agave radar of the Super Ã‰tendard was picked up.|$|E

25|$|Military success brought Bismarck {{tremendous}} {{political support}} in Prussia. In {{the elections of}} 1866 the liberals suffered a major defeat, losing their majority in the House of Deputies. The new, largely conservative House was on much better terms with Bismarck than previous bodies; at the Minister President's request, it retroactively approved the budgets {{of the past four}} years, which had been implemented without parliamentary consent. Bismarck <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> would split the liberal opposition. While some liberals argued that constitutional government was a bright line that should not be crossed, most of them believed it would be a waste of time to oppose the bill, and supported it in hopes of winning more freedom in the future.|$|E

25|$|Even before {{dopamine}} {{was identified}} as the third catecholamine transmitter, Blaschko <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> might possess receptors of its own, since Peter Holtz and his group in 1942 had found that small doses of dopamine lowered the blood pressure of rabbits and guinea pigs, whereas adrenaline always increased the blood pressure. Holtz erred in his interpretation, but Blaschko had â€³no doubt that his observations are of the greatest historical importance, as the first indication of an action of dopamine that characteristically and specifically differs {{from those of the}} two other catecholaminesâ€³. A re-investigation of the blood pressure-lowering effect in dogs in 1964 proposed â€³specific dopamine receptors for dilationâ€³, {{and at the same time}} evidence for dopamine receptors distinct from Î±- and Î²-adrenoceptors accrued from other experimental approaches.|$|E
25|$|In August 1227, {{during the}} fall of Yinchuan, Genghis Khan died. The exact cause of his death remains a mystery, and is {{variously}} attributed to being killed in action by Western Xia, falling from his horse, illness, or wounds sustained in hunting or battle. The Galician-Volhynian Chronicle alleges {{he was killed by}} the Western Xia in battle, while Marco Polo wrote that he died after the infection of an arrow wound he received during his final campaign. Later Mongol chronicles connect Genghis' death with a Western Xia princess taken as war booty. One chronicle from the early 17th century even relates the legend that the princess hid a small dagger and stabbed him, though some Mongol authors have doubted this version and <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> to be an invention by the rival Oirads.|$|E
25|$|However, {{when the}} Czech Republic was created {{as one of}} two {{successor}} states, he stood for election as its first president on 26 January 1993, and won. He did not have nearly the power that he had as president of Czechoslovakia. Although he was nominally the new country's chief executive, the Constitution of the Czech Republic intended to vest most of the real power in the prime minister. However, owing to his prestige, he still commanded {{a good deal of}} moral authority, and the presidency acquired a greater role than the framers intended. For instance, largely due to his influence, the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia, successor to the KSC's branch in the Czech Lands, was kept on the margins for most of his presidency, as Havel <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> was still an unreformed Stalinist party.|$|E

25|$|From 1928 to 1932, the Hungarian {{research}} team of Albert Szent-GyÃ¶rgyi and Joseph L. Svirbely, {{as well as}} the American team led by Charles Glen King in Pittsburgh, first identified the anti-scorbutic factor. Szent-GyÃ¶rgyi had isolated the chemical hexuronic acid (actually, L-hexuronic acid, although he did not know the stereochemistry at that time) from animal adrenal glands at the Mayo clinic, and <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> to be the antiscorbutic factor, but could not prove this without a biological assay. At the same time, for five years King's laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh had been trying to isolate the antiscorbutic factor in lemon juice using the original 1907 model of scorbutic guinea pigs which developed scurvy when not fed fresh foods, but were cured by lemon juice. They had also considered hexuronic acid as being the vitamin, but had been put off the trail when a coworker made the explicit (and mistaken) experimental claim that this substance was not the antiscorbutic substance.|$|E
