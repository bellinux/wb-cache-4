This research focuses on the key techniques used in strategic sourcing departments and issues faced in making a strategic <b>sourcing</b> <b>procurement</b> decision in South Africa. Large South African industrial and resource companies that are acknowledged leaders in strategic sourcing in South Africa were interviewed. The data gathering consisted of structured interviews with the overall leader, or their deputies, of strategic sourcing in each company. The research objective was broken down into a number of different propositions, supporting the techniques used in sourcing departments and issues faced when making a strategic <b>sourcing</b> <b>procurement</b> decision. The results showed relatively strong support for the identified techniques (from a review of literature) that strategic sourcing departments use, including crossfunctional sourcing teams, sourcing information systems, alignment with corporate strategy and the use of a formal sourcing process. There was little support for value chain mapping and formal supplier relationship management. There was poor support for the issues identified in the literature as affecting a strategic <b>sourcing</b> <b>procurement</b> decision. Core competencies, the external environment, product and process and technology and demand variability did not play a significant role in a strategic <b>sourcing</b> <b>procurement</b> decision. The only strongly supported area was around cost management. The South African companies who have been conducting strategic sourcing efforts for the longest are likely to be using the most techniques and most other companies plan to use more. However, the procurement department’s involvement in strategic outsourcing decisions remains minima...|$|E

40|$|In a {{fiercely}} competitive environment, Supply Chain {{has emerged}} as a key strategic competency. In today's environment, it is essential for all organizations to have an efficient supply chain. Supply chain includes all types of organizations engaged in transportation, warehousing, information processing, and materials handling. <b>Sourcing,</b> <b>procurement,</b> production scheduling, manufacturing, order processing, inventory management, warehousing, and, finally, customer service are the functions performed throughout the supply chain. The ultimate goal of SCM is to meet customers ’ demand more efficiently by providing the right product, in the right quantity, at the right location, on the right time, and in the right condition. Traditionally, marketing, distribution, planning, manufacturing, and the purchasing organizations along the supply chain operated independently.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of electronic markets have been based purely on a single variable (price) as the factor that determines ‘the winner’. Multi-attribute auctions {{are likely to be}} more appropriate for procurement scenarios where factors other than price need to be considered in determining the outcome. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of empirical research on multi-attribute electronic auctions. In particular, there is little empirical evidence of how multi-attribute auctions fit with our theoretical conceptualisation of electronic markets. This paper uses the market design aspects of multi-attribute auctions to explore a multivariable electronic auction, using frameworks from electronic market process design and systematic sourcing. Evidence from the case study illustrates that multi-variable electronic auctions can be used to procure a wider range of operating and manufacturing input that has been considered possible with traditional, price only, auctions. The findings reveal how the use of an electronic auction intermediary creates a middle ground of interaction between spot and systematic sourcing, by automating for the buyer certain general parameters and trade context processes.

40|$|Internet {{technology}} has been increasingly used to enhance the global competitiveness of various business applications through the widespread electronic commerce (EC) functions. Many Internet-based systems have been designed and developed for supply chain management (SCM) in various areas such as computer, garment, and publishing industries, which mainly center on communication infrastructure, coordination between production and distribution, and procurement functions with security mechanisms. However, EC is not a panacea. On many occasions, participants (including buyers, sellers, and enablers) face various risks and overhead during the deployment of a new technology. In this article, we present the impact of EC on procurement processes in supply chains, highlighting the issues of buyers, sellers, and the transaction processes involved. The procurement processes are classified into preprocurement (<b>sourcing),</b> <b>procurement</b> (quotation, negotiation, order placement, and transaction), and postprocurement (delivery). Moreover, a four-phase migration model of procurement onto the Internet is introduced to illustrate the technical, security, and financial requirements in the deployment process of EC. The migration model not only gives a development guideline of procurement functions, but also provides an evaluation framework of e-procurement. An industrial example is used to illustrate the corresponding evolution {{as a result of}} EC deployment. The paper concludes with a summary of EC impact and future research directions. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} a newsvendor that is served by multiple suppliers, where any given supplier is defined to be either perfectly reliable or unreliable. By perfectly reliable we mean a supplier that delivers an amount identically equal to the amount desired, {{as is the case}} in the most basic variant of the newsvendor problem. By unreliable, we mean a supplier that with some probability delivers an amount strictly less than the amount desired. Our results indicate the following effects of unreliability: From the perspective of the newsvendor, the aggregate quantity ordered is higher than otherwise would be ordered if the newsvendor's suppliers were completely reliable. From the perspective of end customers, however, the service level provided is lower than otherwise would be provided if the newsvendor's suppliers were completely reliable. From the perspective of the suppliers, although reliability affects how much is ordered from a selected supplier, cost generally takes precedence over reliability when it comes to selecting suppliers in the first place. Even perfect reliability is no guarantee for qualification since, in an optimal solution, a given supplier will be selected only if all less-expensive suppliers are selected, regardless of the given supplier's reliability level. Nevertheless, the relative size of a selected supplier's order depends on its reliability. newsvendor, supplier diversification, random yield, multisupplier <b>sourcing,</b> <b>procurement,</b> disruption management...|$|E
40|$|The {{procurement}} {{of product}} development and production services brings special strategic considerations to the buyer-seller relationship in industrial and institutional markets. Multiple sourcing, in particular dual sourcing, is a likely {{way of dealing}} with the increased risks faced by buyers. However, there is lack of dual sourcing models that analyze the selection and control process in an integrated fashion. This omission had led to apparently contradictory findings in agency and auction theory. The paper models the strategic issues for a cost containment contest between two suppliers. The suppliers are drawn from several vendors who participate in a bidding competition. The supplier with the lower final cost in the contest wins a larger share of the pooled profit fee. Propositions are derived for the optimal cost-plus contest, and comparisons are made with the common incentive contract for the integrated selection and control model. The larger the winner's share, the greater the effort. The buyer can make a credible commitment to the optimal winner's share. As the winner's share rises, however, the bid prices increase due to increased contract risk. This incentive-risk tradeoff determines (a) the optimal winner's share that minimizes expected procurement price, (b) the corresponding profit fee bid by suppliers, (c) the ensuing cost control effort, and (d) the final price for the procurement. Comparisons with the common incentive contract tell us when the cost-plus contest induces more effort, and when bidding for a contest results in a lower final procurement price. agency theory, bidding, contests, dual <b>sourcing,</b> <b>procurement...</b>|$|E

It's called supply-chain management and it encompasses all of those integrated activities that bring product to market and create satisfied customers. The Supply Chain Management Program integrates topics from manufacturing operations, purchasing, transportation, and physical distribution into a unified program. Successful supply chain management, then, coordinates and integrates all of these activities into a seamless process. It embraces and links all of the partners in the chain. In addition to the departments within the organization, these partners include vendors, carriers, third party companies, and information systems providers. Within the organization, the supply chain refers to a wide range of functional areas. These include Supply Chain Management-related activities such as inbound and outbound transportation, warehousing, and inventory control. <b>Sourcing,</b> <b>procurement,</b> and supply management fall under the supply-chain umbrella, too.
