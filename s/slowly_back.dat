5|$|After {{the train}} departs from the station, it {{immediately}} begins {{to climb the}} vertical (90 degree) lift hill. Upon reaching {{the top of the}} lift, the train turns 45 degrees backwards putting the train and its riders in an upside down position. Then, as the train exits the lift, it goes through a heartline roll before going down the only drop in the layout of the roller coaster. The train speeds through the station going back up the lift. Once it loses momentum the train then returns down passing through the station again. It then proceeds back up the drop and partially into the heartline roll before once again losing momentum and returning to the ground. After passing the station for the third time, the train is stopped {{near the top of the}} lift hill. It is then lowered back down to the station where the next riders board the train. The XT 150 has the option of sending riders around a second cycle at the operator's discretion. When the train stops on the lift hill at the end of the ride, instead of lowering <b>slowly</b> <b>back</b> to the station, the chain will raise the car up and send it through the ride again.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Vergne was quickest with a lap of {{one minute and}} 2.350 seconds, ahead of Prost in second and Bird third. Rosenqvist was fourth-fastest; Félix da Costa was fifth and Heidfeld sixth. Buemi was seventh-fastest, Ma eighth, Sarrazin ninth and Loïc Duval rounded the top ten ahead of qualifying. Duval lost control {{of his car and}} crashed into the turn ten outside barrier's exit, removing both his right-hand side tyres, and caused the session to be stopped for ten minutes to allow his car to be removed from the centre of the track. Engel spun and damaged his right-rear suspension, but was able to drive <b>slowly</b> <b>back</b> to the pit lane. Di Grassi ran wide and went deep into the turn two run-off area. He spun his car to leave the corner but made contact with the wall, removing his rear wing. López lost his vehicle's nose cone in a collision with the wall at the same corner, and his rear wing was removed from his car when he impacted the turn eight barrier. The driver's rear wing was off the racing line, avoiding the need for yellow flags, and Piquet caused the session to conclude under red flag conditions when he heavily collided with the chicane exit barrier.|$|E
25|$|A {{performance}} of Faust begins with Christine singing {{the lead role}} of Marguerite ("Ah! Do I Hear My Lover's Voice?"). However, during the song there's an unscheduled blackout and when the lights come back up, Christine has disappeared. The show quickly adjourns {{and the rest of}} the cast search high and low for her all over the Opera House, taking their lanterns into the audience ("No Sign! I See No Sign!"). But to no avail. The scene switches to The Phantom's underground domain where he has kidnapped Christine in his boat and ties her to a post at his mist-shrouded dock before rowing <b>slowly</b> <b>back</b> into the darkness, leaving Christine behind ("Somewhere Above The Sun Shines Bright").|$|E

25|$|About 1pm, as Drake moved sluggishly {{out across}} Belfast Lough, {{a small boat}} came out to her, {{carrying}} another volunteer, Royal Navy Lieutenant William Dobbs, a local man who had just gotten married. According to Drake pilot {{he brought with him}} a copy of an express letter from Whitehaven, explaining the full details of the mystery ship (Jones states in his official report that the news from Whitehaven had arrived the previous evening and was known to his morning captives). With the wind and tide more favourable in the afternoon, Ranger moved <b>slowly</b> <b>back</b> out of the Lough into the North Channel, making sure never to get too far ahead of Drake. Finally, about 6pm, the two enemies were within hailing distance. Jones had the American naval colours flying, and Lieut. Dobbs' formal inquiry as to the ship's identity was answered with absolute truth.|$|E
25|$|Thousands of coal {{fires are}} burning around the world. Those burning {{underground}} {{can be difficult}} to locate and many cannot be extinguished. Fires can cause the ground above to subside, their combustion gases are dangerous to life, and breaking out to the surface can initiate surface wildfires. Coal seams can be set on fire by spontaneous combustion or contact with a mine fire or surface fire. Lightning strikes are an important source of ignition. The coal continues to burn <b>slowly</b> <b>back</b> into the seam until oxygen (air) can no longer reach the flame front. A grass fire in a coal area can set dozens of coal seams on fire. Coal fires in China burn an estimated 120 million tons of coal a year, emitting 360 million metric tons of CO2, amounting to 2–3% of the annual worldwide production of CO2 from fossil fuels. In Centralia, Pennsylvania (a borough located in the Coal Region of the United States), an exposed vein of anthracite ignited in 1962 due to a trash fire in the borough landfill, located in an abandoned anthracite strip mine pit. Attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful, and it continues to burn underground to this day. The Australian Burning Mountain was originally believed to be a volcano, but the smoke and ash come from a coal fire that has been burning for some 6,000 years.|$|E
500|$|BuzzSaw is a steel, Maurer Söhne SkyLoop XT 150 roller coaster. As part of Maurer Söhne's X-Coaster {{range of}} roller coasters, the SkyLoop {{begins with a}} {{vertical}} chain lift hill to a height of [...] At {{the top of this}} lift hill, the car is pulled <b>slowly</b> <b>back</b> over on itself before it is released into a full heartline roll and a drop down a steep hill back towards the station. The train then oscillates between the two hills before it is caught by the chain hill and slowly lowered back down into the station. A single ride on BuzzSaw is completed in approximately 50 seconds.|$|E

500|$|After heavy fighting, the Royalists {{had succeeded}} only in pushing Essex's forces briefly back; {{they had given}} ground but not retreated from the battle, and his main force of {{infantry}} remained strong. In an attempt to proceed, Essex waved his infantry and light artillery forward. Rupert's cavalry {{was too weak to}} defend against this advance due to its large firepower, and he instead ordered two regiments of foot commanded by John Belasyse to halt Essex. The Parliamentarian records report they were [...] "hotly charged by the enemies' horse and foot", who succeeded in forcing Essex <b>slowly</b> <b>back,</b> although the fight took four hours. In response, Essex called for Skippon to send him reinforcements; Skippon obliged by ordering a Mainwaring's Regiment of infantry to remove themselves from his line and march to replace some of Essex's exhausted soldiers. As soon as they arrived, they were charged by two bodies of cavalry and a regiment of infantry under John Byron, who forced the regiment to retreat; the Royalists hacked down the fleeing Parliamentarians and, according to Byron, his force [...] "had not left a man of them unkilled, but that the hedges were so high the horse could not pursue them". Although the Royalists failed to press this attack due to the difficulty of manoeuvring cavalry in the field, and Essex briefly retook the ground, the loss of this infantry regiment opened a gap in the Parliamentarian line. If Rupert was able to drive through this gap, he would break Essex's army into two wings and be able to encircle them. Recognizing this possibility, he began redeploying the Royalist force: two regiments of cavalry and a regiment of infantry under his command would occupy Essex, while two regiments under Charles Gerard would push through the gap in the Parliamentarian line.|$|E
2500|$|By now {{the allied}} foot had {{penetrated}} the French lines for {{a distance of}} 300 yards, and into the French camp. However, the incessant fire from the flanks – from Fontenoy and the Redoubt of Eu – followed by the constant cavalry and infantry attacks, had caused the British and Hanoverian infantry to yield ground, forcing them <b>slowly</b> <b>back</b> towards {{the crest of the}} plateau. Endeavouring to restore order, Cumberland personally exhorted and inspired his men, halting their retreat, rallying them with the cry: ...|$|E

2500|$|Absence, emptiness, nothingness, and {{unresolved}} mysteries {{are central}} features in many Absurdist plots: for example, in The Chairs an old couple welcomes {{a large number}} of guests to their home, but these guests are invisible so all we see is empty chairs, a representation of their absence. [...] Likewise, the action of Godot is centered around the absence of a man named Godot, for whom the characters perpetually wait. [...] In many of Beckett's later plays, most features are stripped away and what's left is a minimalistic tableau: a woman walking <b>slowly</b> <b>back</b> and forth in Footfalls, for example, or in Breath only a junk heap on stage and the sounds of breathing.|$|E
2500|$|For {{all the men}} {{involved}} it {{had been}} a test of character, which some failed.

2500|$|Calf Roping, {{also called}} Tie-down roping, {{is based on}} ranch work in which calves are roped for branding, medical treatment, or other purposes. It is the oldest of rodeo's timed events. The cowboy ropes a running calf around the neck with a lariat, and his horse stops and sets back on the rope while the cowboy dismounts, runs to the calf, throws {{it to the ground}} and ties three feet together. (If the calf falls when roped, the cowboy must lose time waiting for the calf to get back to its feet so that the cowboy can do the work.) The job of the horse is to hold the calf steady on the rope. [...] A well-trained calf-roping horse will <b>slowly</b> <b>back</b> up while the cowboy ties the calf, to help keep the lariat snug.|$|E

2500|$|On 31 August, German air {{reconnaissance}} saw British columns marching towards Villers-Cotterêts (Villers) and the 1st Army headquarters assumed that {{troops in the}} Oise valley were British and those retreating towards Soissons were French. Kluck concluded {{that it would be}} impossible to trap the British but a pursuit towards Soissons might catch up with the French. The II Cavalry Corps was ordered to advance southwards, as it was assumed that the British had reached Villers-Cotterêts. During the afternoon another {{air reconnaissance}} reported that many troops were seen at the village and that some might be captured. Kluck ordered the 1st Army to advance southwards with unlimited objectives.

Supplies ran out on the German side and German counter-attacks began on the right flank, at [...] Redoubt and The Crucifix, despite an accurate flank barrage from the French artillery. The 146th Brigade of the 49th (West Riding) Division attacked Thiepval at [...] but stopped after the leading battalion was shot down. A German counter-attack then began on the left flank and was equally visible to the British, who destroyed the attack with Lewis guns and artillery. At [...] two of the 146th Brigade battalions were ordered to [...] Redoubt to reinforce the Irish, who were being forced <b>slowly</b> <b>back</b> by counter-attacks but the leading battalions had been committed to the Thiepval attack and the other two were in the 32nd Division front line.

2500|$|Button {{initiated}} a second attack at Pérez and passed him entering the Rettifilo chicane but was slow leaving the turn after locking his tyres, enabling Pérez {{to fight back}} and regained eighth by forcing Button wide heading into the Variante della Roggia chicane. Ricciardo caught Magnussen and passed him around the outside at the Rettifilo chicane to take over sixth place on lap 45 despite locking his tyres and drifting sideways. Ricciardo received a message to chase his teammate Vettel and attempted to overtake him around the outside entering the Rettifilo chicane on lap 47 with Vettel defending fifth place but was slow leaving the turn. Both drivers went alongside {{each other through the}} Curva Grande corner and Ricciardo turned to the inside line and overtook Vettel for fifth place at the Variante della Roggia chicane. Hülkenberg lost eleventh position to Kvyat on the same lap and began drawing closer to Räikkönen. Gutiérrez had brake problems and made contact with Grosjean at the Rettifilo chicane on the 51st lap, puncturing the Sauber's right-rear tyre, and was forced to drove <b>slowly</b> <b>back</b> to the pit lane.|$|E

2500|$|The optimal {{approach}} is {{from behind and}} below (not level with) the drogue. [...] Because the drogue is relatively light (typically soft canvas webbing) and subject to aerodynamic forces, it can be pushed around by the bow wave of approaching aircraft, exacerbating engagement even in smooth air. [...] After initial contact, the hose and drogue is pushed forward by the receiver a certain distance (typically, a few feet), and the hose is reeled <b>slowly</b> <b>back</b> onto its drum in the HDU. [...] This opens the tanker's main refueling valve allowing fuel to flow to the drogue under the appropriate pressure (assuming the tanker crew has energized the pump). [...] Tension on the hose is aerodynamically 'balanced' by a motor in the HDU so that as the receiver aircraft moves fore and aft, the hose retracts and extends, thus preventing bends in the hose that would cause undue side loads on the probe. [...] Fuel flow is typically indicated by illumination of a green light near the HDU. [...] If the hose is pushed in too far or not far enough, a cutoff switch will inhibit fuel flow, which is typically accompanied by an amber light. [...] Disengagement is commanded by the tanker pilot with a red light.|$|E
2500|$|Dry {{fly fishing}} on small, clear-water streams can be {{especially}} productive if the angler stays as {{low to the ground}} and as far from the bank as possible, moving upstream with stealth. Trout tend to face upstream and most of their food is carried to them on the current. For this reason, the fish's attention is normally focused into the current; most anglers move and fish [...] "into the current", fishing from a position downstream of the fish's suspected lie. Trout tend to strike their food at current [...] "edges", where faster- and slower-moving waters mix. Obstructions to the stream flow, such as large rocks or nearby pools, provide a [...] "low energy" [...] environment where fish sit and wait for food without expending much energy. Casting upstream to the [...] "edge" [...] of the slower water, the angler can see the fly land and drift <b>slowly</b> <b>back</b> downstream. The challenge in stream fishing is placing the fly with deadly accuracy, within inches of a protective rock for instance, not long range casting. Done properly, the fly seems to be just floating along in the current with a [...] "perfect drift" [...] as if not connected to the fly line. The angler must remain vigilant for the [...] "take" [...] in order to be ready to raise the rod tip and set the hook.|$|E
2500|$|On the 25th Brigade front, the {{infantry}} suffered {{a similar fate}} but small parties were able to rush from shell-hole to shell-hole {{and get into the}} front trench at [...] only to find it so badly damaged that there was no cover and consolidation failed. A few troops reached the second trench but by [...] had been forced out by enfilade fire and counter-attacks by bombers. The support battalion had moved up to the British front line, been caught by the German barrage and then had many casualties trying to cross no man's land, the three battalions all losing more than fifty percent of their men; only after night fell were the survivors able to return. Parts of the 10th, 9th companies IR 180 faced the attack, with the 12th and 6th companies in support. Only {{on the left side of}} Sector P5, which had been the most damaged part of the defences was penetrated but much of the garrison was caught underground trying to dig their way through collapsed entrances.
