25|$|The Eastern Desert has a quite {{different}} range of fauna and has {{much in common with}} the Sinai Peninsula, showing the importance of the broad Nile in separating the two desert regions. Here are found the striped hyena, Nubian ibex, bushy-tailed jird, golden spiny mouse, Blanford's fox and Rüppell's fox. The sand partridge, streaked scrub warbler, mourning wheatear and white-crowned wheatear are typical of this region. The high rocky mountains of Gebel Elba in the south have a distinctive range of animals including the aardwolf, <b>striped</b> <b>polecat,</b> and common genet, and there may still be African wild ass in this area.|$|E
25|$|The {{large mammals}} {{present in the}} {{ecoregion}} are the addax (Addax nasomaculatus), Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia), dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), and rhim gazelle (Gazella leptoceros). However, rodents are the most represented order of mammals in the Tibesti, and include the Agag gerbil (Gerbillus agag), Balochistan gerbil (Gerbillus nanus), Cairo spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus), lesser Egyptian jerboa (Jaculus jaculus), Libyan jird (Meriones libycus), Mzab gundi (Massoutiera Mzabi) and the North African gerbil (Gerbillus campestris). Also present are cats such as the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) and, more rarely, the caracal (Caracal caracal) and the Sudan cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), {{as well as several}} canine species including the Egyptian wolf (Canis anthus lupaster), fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) and Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii). The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) may also occupy the range. There may be as many as 50 endangered painted hunting dogs (Lycaon pictus) in the Tibesti, although some regard these relict populations as extirpated, partially due to the Darfur refugee turmoil and other Sudan generated conflicts. Bats are heavily represented in the Tibesti, including the desert long-eared bat (Otonycteris hemprichii), greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum), Hamilton's tomb bat (Taphozous hamiltoni), Mauritian tomb bat (Taphozous mauritianus) and the trident bat (Asellia tridens). The Cape hare (Lepus capensis), desert hedgehog (Paraechinus aethiopicus), olive baboon (Papio anubis), rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) and the Saharan <b>striped</b> <b>polecat</b> (Ictonyx libyca) also populate the area.|$|E
500|$|Chapters 20, 21, and 22 {{discuss the}} [...] "disguising-coloration" [...] of mammals, {{including}} the whales which [...] "are {{equipped with a}} full obliterative shading of surface-colors". The bats are admitted to have {{very little in the}} way of countershading, unlike all other families in the order. Thayer notes that a few species with strong defences such as hedgehogs, porcupines, echidnas, pangolins and [...] "some armadillos" [...] are exceptions, along with some beasts which [...] "enjoy a like security by virtue of their gigantic bigness", including the elephants, rhinoceroses, and hippopotami. The domestic hare is shown to be strongly countershaded with a pair of photographs [...] "from life", one sitting and one [...] "laid on its back, outdoors, so that the obliterative shading is reversed". Chapter 21 asserts that zebras [...] "must be extraordinarily inconspicuous" [...] against vegetation, a claim derided by Theodore Roosevelt (see below). Chapter 22 addresses the problem of the [...] "few [...] whose bold, clear patterns seem to defy that foremost obliterative law." [...] These include the skunks, the African zoril (<b>striped</b> <b>polecat)</b> and the teledu (stink badger) of Java, which all have dark underparts and white upperparts.

50|$|The Saharan <b>stripe</b> <b>polecat</b> {{is found}} {{on the margins of}} deserts {{especially}} in mountains, in arid stony terrain and sandy semideserts, rarely seen in woodlands and is prefers steppe like habitat.|$|R
50|$|The Saharan <b>stripe</b> <b>polecat</b> is {{distributed}} around {{the northern and}} southern edges of the Sahara Mauretania, Western Sahara and Morocco in the west along the Mediterranean littoral of North Africa to the Nile Valley in Egypt, while in the south its range is the Sahel east to Sudan and Djibouti.|$|R
5000|$|The forest shrew excavates {{a shallow}} burrow or {{takes over the}} burrow of another small mammal. The complex of {{passages}} has several entrances and a nesting chamber containing dry grasses. These shrews are territorial and a breeding pair of shrews is often found in a nest. [...] The forest shrew is mainly nocturnal and is an insectivore, but its diet also includes any small invertebrates it can find, including earthworms, millipedes, centipedes, crustaceans, and spiders. The forest shrew is preyed upon by barn owls, marsh mongooses, striped weasels, and <b>striped</b> <b>polecats.</b> To avoid predation, it spends most of its time in its burrow and only leaves when it needs to feed or defecate. Its droppings are very pungent.|$|R
50|$|The Saharan <b>striped</b> <b>polecat,</b> {{also known}} as the Saharan striped weasel, Libyan striped weasel, and the North African striped weasel (Ictonyx libycus) is a species of mammal in the family Mustelidae. This animal is {{sometimes}} characterized as being a part of the genus Poecilictis, and its coloration resembles that of the <b>striped</b> <b>polecat.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>polecat</b> is an {{aggressive}} and very territorial animal. It marks its territory with its feces and through an anal spray. The spray {{serves as a}} defense against predators, {{in a similar manner}} as employed by skunks. The spray, released by anal stink glands, temporarily blinds their adversaries and irritates the mucous membranes, resulting in an intense burning sensation. Before spraying the opponent with this noxious fluid, the <b>striped</b> <b>polecat</b> will often take a deimatic (threat) stance with its back arched, rear end facing the opponent, and tail straight up in the air.|$|E
50|$|Small {{carnivores}} {{include the}} <b>Striped</b> <b>Polecat</b> (Ictonyx striatus), the Small-Spotted Genet (Genetta genetta), Yellow Mongoose (Cynictis penicillata), Kaokoland Slender Mongoose (Galerella flavescens), Banded Mongoose (Mungos mungo), and Meerkat (Suricata suricatta).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Striped</b> <b>polecats</b> {{are about}} 60 - 70 cm in length, {{including}} their tails, and 10 - 15 cm tall to the shoulders on average. They weigh anywhere from [...]6 kg to 1.3 kg, generally, the males being {{the larger of}} the two sexes. Their specific coloring varies by location. Generally they are black on the underside, white on the tail, with stripes running from their heads down their backs and on their cheeks. The legs and feet are black. Their skulls are usually around 56 mm long, and they have unique face mask coloring, often including a white spot on their head, and white ears. These masks are thought to serve as warnings to potential predators or other antagonists.|$|R
50|$|<b>Striped</b> <b>polecats</b> {{have been}} known to {{communicate}} with each other using a myriad of verbal signals and calls. Growls are used to act as a warning to possible predators, competitors, or other enemies to back off. High pitched screams have been observed as signifying situations of high aggression or accompanying the spraying of anal emissions. An undulating high to low pitched scream has been used to convey surrender or submission to an adversary. This call has been noted to accompany the subsequent release of the loser. Conversely, a quieter undulating call has been interpreted as functioning as a friendly salutation. Mating calls are common forms of communication between the sexes. Finally, young polecats often have a specific set of calls and signals, used when they are in adolescence, either signifying a feeling of distress or joy depending on if the mother is absent or present.|$|R
40|$|Ethnopharmacological {{relevance}} The use {{of animals}} and plants as traditional remedies for both medical afflictions and social or cultural issues (symbolism) {{has a long history}} in South Africa and a reasonably large proportion of the population will consult a traditional healer during their life-time. Compared to plants, the use of animal parts in traditional medicine and folklore is poorly documented. Methods We interviewed 32 traders from South Africa's largest traditional medicine market, the Faraday Street market in Johannesburg, of which only 20 consented to supplying some species use information. Traders are particularly protective of the medicinal properties of their wares. Given the sensitive nature of this information (12 traders declined to be interviewed), we were only able to gather data on their perceived uses and no data on dosages, efficacy, or individual turn-over of products. We assessed the trade of animal parts from the perspective of consumer needs by analysing use-categories (e. g. headaches, strokes, skin problems, bad luck, etc.) and the degree of informant consensus in the selection of fauna to treat certain conditions. Results We documented 301 uses for animal parts from 52 species and 18 'morphospecies' that we allocated to 122 broad-use categories. Overall, reptiles and mammals were the most frequently used taxa in traditional medicine and some species had multiple uses (i. e., appeared in multiple use-categories) including crocodiles, lizards generally, chameleons, <b>striped</b> <b>polecats,</b> elephants and jackals. Animals were mostly used for 'strength' (physical or overcoming fear), but also as love charms, warding off bad luck or bad spirits or improving one's luck. Only 36 % of our categories were medicinal (e. g., headaches, skin problems, swollen feet, etc.). We also found a high rate of non-disclosure of uses per species (a mean 86 % of traders did not reveal information on the use of a species), and a variable degree of consensus between the traders on what particular species are actually used for. Conclusions We suggest that traditional medicine markets provide a unique opportunity to gauge the health and symbolic or personal issues representative of a large sector of society. What's more, we recommend that researchers be more mindful in the way that use information is reported. We also highlight the potentially serious threat of traditional medicine to species that may be particularly vulnerable by virtue of their restricted distribution or predictable behaviour. 9 page(s...|$|R

50|$|Like other mustelids, the <b>striped</b> <b>polecat</b> is a carnivore. It has 34 {{sharp teeth}} which are optimal for {{shearing}} flesh and grinding meat. Its diet includes various small rodents, snakes, birds, amphibians, and insects.

5000|$|Saharan striped polecats {{are about}} 55-70 cm in length, {{including}} their tails, and generally weigh between [...]5 and [...]75 kg. It is striped white in a non-uniform fashion and has black feet, legs, ears, and underside. Often a white ring {{goes around the}} face and above a black snout. It is sometimes confused with the <b>striped</b> <b>polecat</b> though it is generally smaller and has distinct facial markings.|$|E
50|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>polecat</b> is {{a solitary}} creature, often only associating {{with other members}} of its species in small family groups or for the purpose of breeding. It is nocturnal, hunting mostly at night. During the day it will burrow into the brush or sleep in the burrows of other animals. Most often striped polecats are found in {{habitats}} with large ungulate populations, because of the lower level of shrub that often accompanies the presence of these grazers.|$|E
50|$|Skunks can eject a noxious fluid from glands {{near their}} anus. It {{is not only}} foul smelling, but can cause skin {{irritation}} and, if it gets in the eyes, temporary blindness. Some members of the mustelid family, such as the <b>striped</b> <b>polecat</b> (Ictonyx striatus), also have this capacity to an extent. Pangolins can also emit a noxious smelling fluid from glands near the anus. The greater long-nosed armadillo can release a disagreeable musky odor when threatened.|$|E
50|$|After conception, the {{gestation}} period for a <b>striped</b> <b>polecat</b> is about four weeks. During {{this time the}} mother prepares a nest for her offspring. The newborn polecats will be completely vulnerable; they are born blind, deaf, and naked. Around one to five offspring are born per litter in the summer season.

50|$|Among {{mammalian}} carnivores {{the bulk}} of predatory incidents have reportedly involved mongooses. Common, social species from savanna-edge such as the 710 g yellow mongoose (Cynictis penicillata) and the 725 g meerkats (Suricata suricatta) have been attacked, as well as larger, shy forest dwellers such as the 2500 g Jackson's mongoose (Bdeogale jacksoni). An adult Meller's mongoose (Rhynchogale melleri) weighing about 2200 g which was taken by a Verreaux's eagle-owl on the wing represents the second heaviest known object successfully flown with this species after the aforementioned half-grown vervet monkey. Other smallish carnivores known to fall prey to Verreaux's eagle-owls include the 292 g African striped weasel (Poecilogale albinucha) and its larger cousin, the 817.5 g <b>striped</b> <b>polecat</b> (Ictonyx striatus), which in one nest from {{the border of the}} Kalahari represented the sole prey species for a pair of eagle-owls. In southern Africa, both the cape genet (Genetta tigrina), averaging 1732 g, and the 1600 g black-footed cat (Felis nigripes), the smallest felid in Africa, have been included amongst their prey. The Verreaux's eagle-owl is thought to be a threat to even larger carnivores, including the 4150 g bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis) and the 10000 g aardwolf (Proteles cristata), although whether healthy adults of the latter are in danger is doubtful. An scientifically-observed attack on an adult African wildcat (Felis silvestris cafra), which averages about 4000 g, was aborted after the eagle-owl apparently deemed that the felid was too heavy to take flight with. However, domesticated cats of any size may fall prey to Verreaux's eagle-owl. At Lake Baringo Country Club in Kenya, this eagle-owl has apparently taken to habitually hunting outdoor cats, reportedly making the cats on the grounds highly skittish.|$|E
50|$|Smaller {{carnivores}} {{are common}} across the country, and two species, the black-backed jackal and the caracal, are {{seen by some}} as pest species, often taking livestock such as sheep and goats, as lion, leopard, cheetah, African wild dog, and both species of hyena have been largely extirpated outside of protected areas. The serval is a rodent specialist and often occurs in marshy areas. Bat-eared foxes, Cape foxes and small felids such as the black-footed cat (Felis nigripes) and Southern African wildcat (Felis sylvestris cafra) are widespread, although there are concerns about the genetic purity of the African wild cat, as it breeds readily with both domestic and feral domestic cats (Felis sylvestris catus), which dilutes the African wild cat's gene pool. There are many species of mongoose, such as the meerkat, yellow mongoose and water mongoose. There are two genet species, the common genet and the large spotted genet. There are relatively few mustelid species in South Africa, as it appears that most niches taken by mustelids {{elsewhere in the world}} are taken up by vivverids and herpestids in sub-Saharan Africa (only seven species are native to Africa south of the Sahara). Two species of otter are native to South Africa, both inhabiting freshwater habitats and the Cape clawless otter ranging into the sea at the coast. The honey badger is probably the best known mustelid native to the region; aside from the otters, two other species occur, the African striped weasel and the <b>striped</b> <b>polecat</b> - their black-and-white fur serves the same function as that of skunks. The only seal native to the region is the brown fur seal, which breeds in large colonies off Namibia and South Africa.|$|E
50|$|Carnivores are {{exceptionally}} important prey for martial eagles. Among {{these many}} mongoose {{tend to be}} well represented in their diet. Most mongoose native to savanna tend to be highly social burrowers. Most {{of these types of}} mongoose are also relatively small (probably the second smallest important martial eagle food source after korhaans) and can effectively escape quickly to the safety of their underground home, so the lighter, more nimble male martial eagle is more likely to habitually pursue them. In southern Africa, the 0.72 kg meerkat (Suricata suricatta) comprises up to at least 9.6% of prey remains (as in the Cape Province) and the 0.75 kg Cape grey mongoose (Galerella pulverulenta) comprising an average of 7.2% of prey remains in the Cape area. The largest of the social savanna-dwelling mongoose is the banded mongoose at 2.12 kg. Despite often being successful in capturing banded mongoose, in one case when a (presumably inexperienced) immature martial eagle took one to a tree, the dominant male banded mongoose of the group scaled the tree and pulled away from the eagle the still-living mongoose prey to safety. The martial eagle is a known predator of the full size range of mongoose species, from the smallest species, the 0.27 kg common dwarf mongoose (Helogale parvula), to the largest, the 3.38 kg white-tailed mongoose (Ichneumia albicauda). Other moderate-sized carnivores known to fall prey to martial eagles include 0.83 kg <b>striped</b> <b>polecat</b> (Ictonyx striatus) and a few species of genet, which are about twice as heavy on average as the polecat. The martial eagle, however, can be a surprisingly effective predator of carnivorans close to their own size or larger. In the Cape Province, 72 bat-eared foxes (Otocyon megalotis), which average about 4.1 kg, were found in the prey remains, 85% of which were adults. Other foxes have also been hunted, as well as both black-backed (Canis mesomelas) and golden jackals (Canis aureus). Some of the black-backed jackals that martial eagles have captured and flown off with have included “half-grown” individuals and a rare adult, averaging some 8.9 kg, may also be killed but is usually grounded prey. Despite being marginally the smallest of the 3 jackals, the black-backed is the most aggressive and predatory species, so are probably taken only in surprise blitzes. Adult domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) of up to a modest size may occasionally be killed by martial eagles. Martial eagles are also known to opportunistically grab pups of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) as they emerge from their dens. A similarly impressive range of felids have been included in their prey spectrum. Adults of both domestic cats and their ancestors, the 4.65 kg African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica), are known to fall prey to this species. Arguably their most impressive mammalian carnivore prey though are adults of much larger cat species such as the 10.1 kg serval (Leptailurus serval) and even the 12.7 kg caracal (Caracal caracal). Apparent predatory attacks are even attempted on big cat cubs as they are considered potential predators of lion and leopard (Panthera pardus) cubs and confirmed predators of cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) cubs. Evidence shows, however, they rapidly abandon hunting attempts if the formidable mother lion or leopard are present. Successful predatory attacks on other relatively large carnivores have included adults of the 12.4 kg African civet (Civettictis civetta) and the 8.16 kg aardwolf (Proteles cristata).While large accipitrids from around the world are credited with attacks on (almost always young) ungulates, perhaps no other species is as accomplished in this regard as this martial eagle. Over 30 species of ungulate have been identified as prey for this species, more species than are attributed to the perhaps more powerful crowned eagles and all the world’s golden eagles, although in all 3 seldom more than 30% of the diet are comprised by ungulates in a given region. In Kruger National Park, the martial eagle is mentioned as the only bird considered as a major predator of ungulate species. A majority of the ungulate diet of martial eagles are comprised by small antelope species or the young of larger antelopes. Locally favored prey are the dik-diks, one of the smallest kind of antelope, and every known species may be vulnerable to this eagle. In Tsavo East National Park, Kirk's dik-dik (Madoqua kirkii) were the second most numerous prey species and it was estimated that at least 86 dik-diks are taken in the park {{over the course of the}} year by two pairs of martial eagles. At an average of 5 kg, these can provide a very fulfilling meal for an eagle family. Adults of other smaller antelope such as 4.95 kg suni (Neotragus moschatus) and 4.93 kg blue duikers (Philantomba monticola) are probably also taken with relative ease. In general, the young of other antelope are usually attacked, including newborns. Occasional ambush attacks or successful predations are reported on adults of much larger species despite young ones being rather more vulnerable, including 12.1 kg klipspringers (Oreotragus oreotragus), 11.1 kg steenboks (Raphicerus campestris), both species of grysbok (7.6 to 10.6 kg on average), 14.6 kg oribis (Ourebia ourebi) and perhaps up to half a dozen larger duikers, potentially weighing from 7.7 to 25 kg. One duiker dispatched via strangulation weighed an estimated 37 kg, the largest known raptorial kill for any species on the African continent. Among extant birds of prey, only wedge-tailed eagles, reportedly capable of killing sheep and female red kangaroos (Macropus rufus) weighing up to 50 kg, and golden eagles, credited with taking adult female deer of several species with weights estimated at 50 to 70 kg and capable of apparently dispatching domestic calves weighing up to 114 kg, have larger kills attributed to them. Calves, including neonatal young, of the following antelope may also be included in their prey spectrum: impala (Aepyceros melampus), hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), bontebok (Damaliscus pygargus), common tsessebe (Damaliscus lunatus), springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis), Eudorcas gazelles, gerenuk (Litocranius walleri), bushbuck (Tragelaphus sylvaticus), grey rhebok (Pelea capreolus), kob (Kobus kob) and mountain reedbuck (Redunca arundinum). These species can vary in weight from 2.6 kg (i.e. gazelles) to 11 kg (i.e. tsessebe) in newborns. For the newborn impala, weighing already 5.55 kg, the martial eagle is the only bird considered to be a significant predator. Additionally, piglets of warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) (of which only the martial eagle among accipitrids is similarly mentioned as a significant predator) and bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus) are taken.|$|E
40|$|Diet {{assessments}} {{are critical for}} understanding the foraging behaviour, habitat use and trophic separation of mammalian predators and are vital for gaining insight into how predators influence prey populations. The aim {{of this research was}} to qualitatively describe the diet of black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas, Schreber 1775) using scat analysis on two contrasting land-use types in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Scats were collected on a monthly basis from November 2009 to October 2010 from two game reserves (Great Fish River Reserve and Shamwari Private Game Reserve) and two neighbouring livestock farms. The relative frequency of occurrence of mammal hair (33 – 47 %) and vegetation (32 – 45 %) dominated jackal diet throughout the year across the four study sites. Other important prey items included invertebrates (8 – 21 %) and fruit and seeds (3 – 11 %). Birds and reptiles constituted ≤ 2 % of the diet and were only recorded on the game reserves. Significant seasonal dietary shifts were observed on the game reserves but not on the farms. Fruit and seeds were significantly more frequent in the diet during autumn at Great Fish River Reserve and invertebrates were significantly less common in the diet during winter on both reserves. In addition, vegetation was significantly more common in the diet during winter at Shamwari Private Game Reserve. The significant temporal variation of certain prey items is testament to black-backed jackals being opportunistic generalists, foraging on those food items which are most abundant, accessible and energetically beneficial. Land-use type also influenced the diet of black-backed jackals with significantly more invertebrates and, fruit and seeds being recorded on the game reserves than on the farms. By contrast, significantly more mammal hair and vegetation were present in the diet on the farms compared with the game reserves. The mammalian component of the diet was dominated by ruminants and rodents on the game reserves and by ruminants and livestock on the farms. The presence of livestock in the diet of black-backed jackals on the farms highlights their potential impact on the livestock industry in the region and may assist farmers in determining which predators are responsible for stock loss. Previous approaches for identifying mammalian hairs from predator scats have utilised dichotomous keys and reference collections but these are often time-consuming and require a trained individual to carry out the identification. Thus, I also tested the efficacy of an automated pattern recognition programme (HairSnap) for identifying mammalian hairs from black-backed jackal scats. The overall accuracy of the programme was 38 % with black-backed jackal, Greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) and <b>striped</b> <b>polecat</b> (Ictonyx striatus) hairs being accurately identified more often (70 – 80 %) than any other species tested. It is likely that both the size and species composition of the sample resulted in the poor accuracy of the programme. However, with the implementation of several improvement measures (e. g. adjustment of the algorithm) the programme may offer a superior, bias-free method of mammalian hair identification. The dietary information gathered here furthers our knowledge of the biology of the blackbacked jackals, especially in the locally important thicket biome. Moreover, understanding their foraging habits allows for more effective management of the species on both game reserves and farmlands. I recommend that future research should focus on quantitatively assessing the diet of black-backed jackals in the Eastern Cape Province and elsewhere. This will compliment the dietary description provided in this study and may offer a biologically more meaningful indication of the relative importance of the prey items. ...|$|E
