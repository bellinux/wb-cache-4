40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{estimate}} the cost inefficiency by farms using (1) behavioral and (2) stochastic cost frontier functions. The derived measure of inefficiency based on half-normal and/or exponential distribution of one-sided error term is related to socioeconomic variables, and of these, the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>holding,</b> fragmentation of land, subsistence needs, and higher age of farmers contributes positively to inefficiency. The behavioral approach satisfies most of the assumptions of the dual cost function, and the likelihood ratio test rejects the market-efficiency hypothesis. This approach asserts that there is less than optimum use of manures, labor, and fertilizers. The non-optimum use is explained by holding size, education, credit, and subsistence needs. Small farms seem to be more efficient than large farms in the region...|$|E

A comparison of the two indices reveals that typically the Banzhaf index gives a more concentrated power distribution.

By comparing this with costs of activism it proposes a method by which 'significant shareholdings' may be estimated. A significant shareholding is the level above which a shareholding in a company may be said to have private incentives to activism. This approach is applied to two groups of companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, the top 250 and a ten percent random sample. The results indicate that there are very strong incentives for shareholders to be activist participants in corporate governance among the top 250 companies while there is much more diversity among the smaller companies.

Data have been collected from over-exploited, semi-critical and safe villages. The study has shown a wide difference between large and small farms in their access to groundwater resource in terms of cost. The functional analysis has revealed that farm income is lower in over-exploited and semi-critical villages compared to safe villages.

The total cost of groundwater depletion has been reported more in over-exploited villages and the cost increases with increase in the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>holding.</b> The impact of this cost would be maximum on small and marginal farmers because of their low resource base and limited means of income.

40|$|The paper {{revolves}} around the necessity to rid the large tenant of the lease market {{in the interest of}} the poor peasant, who yearns to lease-in a piece of land. The notion that the petty peasant is opting out of the lease market because of costliness of new technology seems unfounded. The peasant is not opting out, rather the large farmer is forcing him to withdraw from the market by appealing to the need of his lessor for secure rental receipts and by paying him rent in fixed cash. It is {{in the interest of the}} large farmer to drive out the petty cultivator from the lease market and thereby gain control over it, because mechanization of farming operations, in the context of high wages, is making heavy demands on him to expand the size of his operational holding.

The study is based on the data collected from the major tomato-producing regions of Karnataka, viz.

30|$|The {{switching}} regression {{results in}} TableÂ  4 demonstrate that {{majority of the}} conventional factors of production have expected signs. But, the marginal effects are different {{in the case of}} both adopters and non-adopters confirming the differential marginal impacts of factors on paddy yield between adopters and non-adopters. The ecosystem dummy is significant in the case of both modern and traditional paddy varieties. This reveals that overall paddy yield is positively and significantly influenced by assured irrigation being represented by ecosystem dummy (ECDMY), no matter whether it is modern varieties or traditional varieties. Of course, paddy is water-intensive crop and it consumes plenty of water. So, assured irrigation is a must for paddy cultivation. Similarly, the total area under paddy (ARPDY) is also positively and significantly influencing paddy yields in the case of both MVs and TVs of paddy. Bigger farm size brings many economies of scale in farm production process. Optimal use of many farm inputs can be achieved if the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> is a big one. So, bigger farm size is always hypothesized to {{have a positive impact on}} productivity. Total fertilizer used (FERT) was being hypothesized to have yield augmenting effects in the case of both varieties, and it retains its expected sign. But, it is significant only in the case of modern varieties. In fact, both fertilizer and MVs are complementary to each other, and both were introduced to Indian farmers as a package during the 1960 s that marked the onset of green revolution in Indian agriculture (Bezbaruah 1994). Even, the output elasticity of fertilizer is bigger in the case of MVs of paddy in comparison to TVs. However, soil quality (SQ) is positive but insignificantly affecting farm production under both technologies. Contact with agricultural extension services is only significant in the second and third specification in the case of adopters only. So it is not that much of an influential factor here.|$|E
40|$|After briefly {{outlining}} the patterns and processes of rural land subdivision and suburbanisation {{in other parts}} of New Zealand, the thesis examines the rural land subdivision regulations and policies throughout the country. The development of a number of small size farmlets in the peri-urban areas has been an indicator of urban expansion in parts of the country. This study is based upon the Kairanga County, a rural area surrounding the city of Palmerston North. In the introduction the county is described {{as it relates to the}} rural land subdivision situation. The study of <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> refers to those farmlets with an area of 20 hectares or less. It was found that most dwellings in the study area which had been built in the 1970 s were concentrated upon 'subdivision' land. These farmlets or holdings also illustrated the patterns of change in land use and land holdings. There has been an increase in the number of dwellings in the rural area of the county, especially in 'subdivision' areas, with an average of more than sixteen houses per year. A small percentage of rural 'subdivision' landowners work full-time on their holdings but most of them are employed in non-farming occupations and only carry on part-time farming activities on their lands. There are 61 percent of all those employed in the county engaged in the non-farming occupations. It was found that there are more 'potential' subdivisions than 'actual' subdivisions both in terms of total area and of total numbers of holdings. Most small holdings tend to be located closer to the Palmerston North Urban Area. The total number of holdings has increased because larger holdings have been subdivided into smaller-sized holdings. The area of 'subdivision' land in holdings of 20 hectares or less represents 23 percent of the total occupied land in the county. The land use patterns of 'subdivision' land have changed with a greater variety of land uses and farming types. There was an average of at least two separate types of land use or farming on each holding. Some 5, 003 hectares of land in the county has been legally subdivided for smaller farmlets each with an area of 20 hectares or less. When these farmlets become 'actual' subdivisions most of them would be in part for residential use and eventually add to the peri-urban area around Palmerston North City. Finally it was concluded that the pattern and process of suburbanisation of Kairanga County will continue as long as 'potential' subdivision land is available for settlement...|$|E
