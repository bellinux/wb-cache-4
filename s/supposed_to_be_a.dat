5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} Hippocratic medicine {{was that of}} a crisis, a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on critical days, which were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a critical day, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E

5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. It was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E
5|$|He {{worked for}} two months in Saudi Arabia in 1976, helping with their {{national}} football team. It was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> longer-term position, but he missed his wife and new daughter and decided not to return after his first holiday back to the UK. BRMB gave him his job back, after which he successfully applied to Midlands Today at the BBC's Pebble Mill Studios in Birmingham, a job that included on-air appearances. One of the earliest stories he covered for them was the murder of Carl Bridgewater, the paperboy who was shot during a robbery in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Parizeau's {{hopes for}} {{international}} recognition, a practical requirement of statehood, rested with France and the Francophonie. He {{believed that if}} Quebec declared independence in these circumstances, President of the French National Assembly Philippe Séguin, a powerful Gaullist power broker who was sympathetic to the sovereignty movement, would pressure President Chirac to recognize the declaration. He counted on a French recognition to spread quickly to the Francophonie and bring the issue to a head. Benoit Bouchard, Canada's ambassador at the time, believed that the plan was irrational as he doubted Séguin, who was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> neutral figure in his role, could bring sufficient pressure in the country's semi-presidential system.|$|E

5|$|The Burning of Falmouth (October 18, 1775) was {{an attack}} by a fleet of Royal Navy vessels on the town of Falmouth, Massachusetts (site of the modern city of Portland, Maine, {{and not to be}} {{confused}} with the modern towns of Falmouth, Massachusetts or Falmouth, Maine). The fleet was commanded by Captain Henry Mowat. The attack began with a naval bombardment which included incendiary shot, followed by a landing party meant to complete the town's destruction. The attack was the only major event in what was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> campaign of retaliation against ports that supported Patriot activities in the early stages of the American Revolutionary War.|$|E
5|$|The Match of 10,000 Tacks was up next, pitting Abyss and Raven against Black Reign and Rellik. Rhino was {{originally}} <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{part of the}} match, but was removed due to a neck injury he sustained in a previous match; he was replaced with Raven. The encounter lasted fourteen minutes and forty-one seconds. Raven forced Reign through a table covered with thumbtacks during the contest. The team of Abyss and Raven won the bout, after Abyss slammed Rellik into a pile of thumbtacks and then gained the pinfall victory. Abyss required stitches {{as a result of}} this match.|$|E

He filled in for an ill David Letterman on his show February 26, 2003, when he was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> guest. On many of his appearances on the show, Willis stages elaborate jokes, such as wearing a day-glo orange suit {{in honor of the}} Central Park gates, having one side of his face made up with simulated buckshot wounds after the Harry Whittington shooting, or trying to break a record (parody of David Blaine) of staying underwater for only twenty seconds.|$|E

5|$|With the TASS force graduated, Diana Taurasi had {{to carry}} most of the load in her junior season, with help from {{returning}} teammates Maria Conlon, Jessica Moore and Ashley Battle and a top-ranked recruiting class of Ann Strother, Barbara Turner, Willnet Crockett and Nicole Wolff. With no seniors on the roster, 2003 was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> rebuilding year for UConn, but as the year progressed {{it became clear that}} Taurasi was up to the challenge of carrying a group of young players to the championship. UConn finished the regular season undefeated and established a 70-game winning streak, shattering the previous mark of 54 set by Louisiana Tech; the streak ended in the Big East championship game loss to Villanova.|$|E
5|$|Initially Los Alamos was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{military}} laboratory, and Oppenheimer {{and other}} researchers were to be commissioned into the Army. He {{went so far as}} to order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform and take the Army physical test, which he failed. Army doctors considered him underweight at , diagnosed his chronic cough as tuberculosis and were concerned about his chronic lumbosacral joint pain. The plan to commission scientists fell through when Robert Bacher and Isidor Rabi balked at the idea. Conant, Groves, and Oppenheimer devised a compromise whereby the laboratory was operated by the University of California under contract to the War Department. It soon turned out that Oppenheimer had hugely underestimated the magnitude of the project; Los Alamos grew from a few hundred people in 1943 to over 6,000 in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Like Florida State, the Virginia Tech Hokies {{began the}} 1999college {{football}} season with raised expectations. In 1998, the Hokies had gone 93 {{during the regular}} season and had posted a 52 record against fellow Big East Conference teams. The Hokies concluded that 1998 season—which was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> rebuilding year—in the 1998 Music City Bowl, where the Hokies defeated the Alabama Crimson Tide, 387. With the addition of redshirt freshman quarterback Michael Vick to a team that had allowed an average of just 12.9points per game on defense, there was the possibility that Tech could improve upon its previous season's performance. Sports Illustrated, for example, predicted that the Hokies might challenge Miami for the Big East football championship, and the preseason Coaches' Poll ranked the Hokies No. 14 prior to {{the first game of the}} season.|$|E

50|$|Below the Génis sericite schist {{follows the}} Puy-de-Cornut arkose. The arkose is {{strongly}} silicified and forms erosionally resistant morphological ridges.

A {{close relationship with the}} Grès Armoricain in Brittany is also considered. Therefore an Ordovician age of the arkose is most likely.|$|R

5|$|Ram Gopal Varma signed Suriya for a {{multilingual}} crime film titled The Businessman in May 2010, to {{be directed}} by Puri Jagannadh simultaneously in Telugu, Tamil and Hindi. The film's protagonist was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> south Indian coming to Mumbai and setting up a crime business using tact and intelligence to emerge {{as one of the}} biggest gangsters. The film's production was expected to begin in October 2010 once Suriya completed his part in 7aum Arivu (2011) and was scheduled for release in the summer of 2011. Jagannadh stated in an interview that principal photography would begin in September 2010.

5|$|The six-man {{match at}} SummerSlam was {{originally}} <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> mixed tag-team match between {{the team of}} Tatanka and Sherri Martel and the team of Bam Bam Bigelow and Luna Vachon. However, Luna broke her arm and Sherri left the WWF in July 1993, however, forcing the WWF to change the match. Two reasons have been given for Sherri's departure: her decision to enroll in cosmetology school and failed drug tests. As a result, Tatanka teamed with The Smoking Gunns and Bigelow teamed with The Headshrinkers. The Gunns and Headshrinkers were rivals in the tag team division but had no real storyline. The feud between Bigelow and Tatanka originated When Tatanka came to the help of Sherri, who had interrupted an interview with Bigelow. Subsequently, Bigelow ambushed Tatanka and cut some of the hair Tatanka had dyed red {{as a tribute to}} his Lumbee heritage.|$|E
5|$|After two {{series of}} Gladiators, Joseph {{was eager to}} return to acting, so took the role of villain Joanne Brennan in Home and Away from 1995 to 1996. In 1999, {{she moved to the}} United States to study acting at the Atlantic Theater Company in New York City, then spent 18 months unsuccessfully auditioning for roles in Los Angeles. In 2001, she was cast as Jo Ellison in the British {{television}} series Cold Feet. She appeared in the fourth and fifth series and returned to Australia two days after filming the final episode in 2002. In 2004, she appeared in a major recurring role as Dr. Grace Connelly in six episodes of the Australian soap opera All Saints. She returned to America after filming All Saints, where she got a small role as flight attendant Cindy Chandler in the pilot episode of Lost. The role was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> one-off in the pilot but a producer liked Joseph and the character, so brought her back for a recurring role in the second, third and sixth seasons. Away from acting, Joseph has been involved in efforts to highlight the effects of Soviet nuclear testing in Kazakhstan, including directing a short film.|$|E
