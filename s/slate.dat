5|$|A {{new game}} {{mechanic}} {{to the series}} {{is the use of}} a <b>slate</b> found on all the Ages. These slates can be carved using the mouse to create shapes and symbols. The use of the <b>slate</b> is necessary to communicate with a shadowy race of creatures known as the Bahro. The Bahro understand certain symbols drawn on the <b>slate</b> and will respond to them; the creatures also retrieve the <b>slate</b> and return it to its original space if the player drops it. <b>Slate</b> symbols can cause environmental changes such as rain or increased wind, which may be necessary for solving puzzles. The <b>slate</b> cannot be carried everywhere due to its size. For example, the player will have to leave the <b>slate</b> behind if they want to climb a ladder.|$|E
5|$|The Greaves Welsh <b>Slate</b> Company {{produces}} roofing slates {{and other}} <b>slate</b> products from Llechwedd, and work also continues at the Berwyn Quarry near Llangollen.

The Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff uses waste <b>slate</b> in many different colours in its design: purple <b>slate</b> from Penrhyn, blue from Cwt-y-Bugail, green from Nantlle, grey from Llechwedd, and black from Corris.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of a <b>slate</b> industry in Wales is attested since the Roman period, when <b>slate</b> was used to roof the fort at Segontium, now Caernarfon. The <b>slate</b> industry grew slowly until the early 18th century, then expanded rapidly until the late 19th century, at which time the most important <b>slate</b> producing areas were in northwest Wales, including the Penrhyn Quarry near Bethesda, the Dinorwic Quarry near Llanberis, the Nantlle Valley quarries, and Blaenau Ffestiniog, where the <b>slate</b> was mined rather than quarried. Penrhyn and Dinorwig were the two largest <b>slate</b> quarries in the world, and the Oakeley mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog was the largest <b>slate</b> mine in the world. <b>Slate</b> is mainly used for roofing, but is also produced as thicker slab {{for a variety of}} uses including flooring, worktops and headstones.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the {{expansion}} properties of <b>slates,</b> this paper tests multiple groups of data, including free expansion ratio, expansion force and expansion strain for the different stratification <b>slates</b> in Chongqing. We found that {{with the increase of}} time, the axial expansion ratio and swelling pressure of different stratification <b>slates</b> begin to increase rapidly in the initial period,until gradually moving to a maximum value. In addition, <b>slates</b> stratification in different directions has different expansion properties, the perpendicular to stratification direction has greater expansion ratio, is about 2. 5 times more than the expansion ratio of parallel to the bedding. In the constrained conditions, axial expansion ratio of the <b>slates</b> is much larger than that without constraints. Different stratification of expansion pressure and the expansion strain of the <b>slates</b> is linear in the volume remains unchanged. This research project has certain reference value for the civil engineering on the different stratification <b>slates</b> expansion construction in Chongqing...|$|R

5|$|In 1831 <b>slate</b> {{duty was}} abolished, and this helped {{to produce a}} rapid {{expansion}} in the industry, particularly since the duty on tiles was not abolished until 1833. The Ffestiniog Railway line was constructed between 1833 and 1836 to transport <b>slate</b> from Blaenau Ffestiniog to the coastal town of Porthmadog, where it was loaded onto ships. The railway was graded so that loaded <b>slate</b> waggons could be run by gravity downhill {{all the way from}} Blaenau Ffestiniog to the port. The empty waggons were hauled back up by horses, which travelled down in 'dandy' waggons. This helped expansion at the Blaenau Ffestiniog quarries, which had previously had to cart the <b>slate</b> to Maentwrog to be loaded onto small boats and taken down the River Dwyryd to the estuary, where it was transferred to larger vessels. There was further expansion at Blaenau when John Whitehead Greaves, who had been running the Votty quarry since 1833, took a lease on the land between this quarry and the main Ffestiniog to Betws-y-Coed road. After years of digging he struck the famous Old Vein in 1846 in what became the Llechwedd quarry. A fire which destroyed a large part of Hamburg in 1842 led to a demand for <b>slate</b> for rebuilding, and Germany became an important market, particularly for Ffestiniog <b>slate.</b>|$|E

50|$|There is {{evidence}} of slaves practicing {{how to read and}} write in secrecy. There have been identified <b>slates</b> discovered near George Washington’s estate in Mount Vernon with writings carved in them. Bly noted that on the slave sites owned by Thomas Jefferson there have been “237 unidentified <b>slates,</b> 27 pencil leads, 2 pencil <b>slates,</b> and 18 writing <b>slates</b> were uncovered in houses once occupied by Jefferson's black bond servants.” That shows that slaves were secretly practicing their reading and writing skills when they had time alone, most likely at night. They also believe slaves practiced their letters in the dirt because it was much easier to hide than writing on <b>slates.</b> Slaves then passed on their newly learned skills to others.|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts by ResearchThis Masters of Arts thesis comprises a novel, <b>Slated,</b> and contextualizing thesis. <b>Slated,</b> a young adult dystopian novel, is Kyla’s story: a sixteen-year-old girl who has been <b>Slated,</b> her memory wiped as punishment for crimes she cannot remember. It {{is set in a}} future England, a society where underage criminals and terrorists are given a so-called second chance with <b>Slating,</b> a new life and family. The thesis considers the writing process of <b>Slated</b> in the context of terrorism and cultural trauma, and the use of creative writing in translating trauma. The definition of terrorism and whether it includes freedom fighters is considered, both in international law and its treatment in dystopian young adult fiction, and the conclusion reached that whether terrorists are considered to be freedom fighters is largely a matter of perspective. The genre of recent dystopian young adult fiction is examined, and how <b>Slated</b> fits within it and within dystopian fiction more generally considered. Finally, the impact of the analysis of terrorism and young adult dystopian fiction on the writing process of <b>Slated</b> is examined...|$|R

5|$|The {{virtues of}} <b>slate</b> as a {{building}} and roofing material {{have been recognized}} since the Roman period. The Roman fort at Segontium, Caernarfon, was originally roofed with tiles, but the later levels contain numerous slates, used for both roofing and flooring. The nearest deposits are about five miles (8km) away in the Cilgwyn area, indicating that the slates were not used merely because they were available on-site. During the mediaeval period, there was small-scale quarrying of <b>slate</b> in several areas. The Cilgwyn quarry in the Nantlle Valley dates from the 12th century, and {{is thought to be}} the oldest in Wales. The first record of <b>slate</b> quarrying in the neighbourhood of the later Penrhyn Quarry was in 1413, when a rent-roll of Gwilym ap Griffith records that several of his tenants were paid 10 pence each for working 5,000 slates. Aberllefenni <b>Slate</b> Quarry may have started operating as a <b>slate</b> mine as early as the 14th century. The earliest confirmed date of operating dates from the early 16th century when the local house Plas Aberllefenni was roofed in slates from this quarry.|$|E
