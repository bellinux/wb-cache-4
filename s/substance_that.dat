5|$|Animal {{testing has}} also {{included}} {{the use of}} placebo testing. In these cases animals are treated with a <b>substance</b> <b>that</b> produces no pharmacological effect, but is administered {{in order to determine}} any biological alterations due to the experience of a substance being administered, and the results are compared with those obtained with an active compound.|$|E
5|$|Command & Conquer, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn, is a 1995 real-time strategy video game developed by Westwood Studios {{and published by}} Virgin Interactive. Set in an alternate history of modern day, the game {{tells the story of}} a world war between two globalized factions: the Global Defense Initiative of the United Nations and a cult-like militant organization called the Brotherhood of Nod, led by the mysterious Kane. The groups compete for control of Tiberium, a mysterious <b>substance</b> <b>that</b> slowly spreads across the world.|$|E

5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{can occur}} in those with acute or chronic liver disease. Episodes can be triggered by infections, GI bleeding, constipation, electrolyte problems, or certain medications. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the build up of ammonia in the blood, a <b>substance</b> <b>that</b> is normally removed by the liver. The diagnosis is typically made after ruling out other potential causes. It may be supported by blood ammonia levels, an electroencephalogram, or a CT scan of the brain.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Hans Kelker {{succeeded in}} synthesizing a <b>substance</b> <b>that</b> had a nematic phase at room temperature, MBBA, {{which is one}} of the most popular {{subjects}} of liquid crystal research. The next step to commercialization of liquid-crystal displays was the synthesis of further chemically stable substances (cyanobiphenyls) with low melting temperatures by George Gray. That work with Ken Harrison and the UK MOD (RRE Malvern), in 1973, led to design of new materials resulting in rapid adoption of small area LCDs within electronic products.|$|E
5|$|Kaminsky {{stands up}} Incanto while he waits at a restaurant. He leaves, murdering a {{slightly}} overweight prostitute who injures {{him in a}} struggle. Incanto is forced to flee before he can fully dissolve the body. At the autopsy, Scully finds that the body's airways are choked with the same <b>substance</b> <b>that</b> dissolved Lauren. The State Genetic Lab report reveals that the skin under the victim's nails contains no oils or fatty acids, convincing Mulder that the killer is sucking body fat from his victims.|$|E

5|$|A {{pathology}} {{has been}} identified on the tail of Apatosaurus, caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might {{have been caused by}} the lack or inhibition of the <b>substance</b> <b>that</b> forms intervertebral disks or joints. It has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to Shunosaurus and mamenchisaurids, and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself.|$|E
5|$|A {{reversal}} agent for benzodiazepines exists, flumazenil (Anexate). Its {{use as an}} antidote is not routinely recommended {{because of the high}} risk of resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 326 people, 4 people had serious adverse events and 61% became resedated following the use of flumazenil. Numerous contraindications to its use exist. It is contraindicated in people with a history of long-term use of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a <b>substance</b> <b>that</b> lowers the seizure threshold or may cause an arrhythmia, and in those with abnormal vital signs. One study found that only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{with the}} IG Farben {{conglomerate}} dismantled {{because of its}} {{central role in the}} Nazi regime, Sterling Products bought half of Bayer Ltd, the British Bayer subsidiary—the other half of which it already owned. However, Bayer Aspirin made up {{only a small fraction of}} the British aspirin market because of competition from Aspro, Disprin (a soluble aspirin drug) and other brands. Bayer Ltd began searching for new pain relievers to compete more effectively. After several moderately successful compound drugs that mainly utilized aspirin (Anadin and Excedrin), Bayer Ltd's manager Laurie Spalton ordered an investigation of a <b>substance</b> <b>that</b> scientists at Yale had, in 1946, found to be the metabolically active derivative of acetanilide: acetaminophen. After clinical trials, Bayer Ltd brought acetaminophen to market as Panadol in 1956.|$|E

5000|$|Neurobiologist and anti-drug activist Rita Levi Montalcini, which a {{few months}} earlier was the protagonist of an anti-drug TV ad campaign, was bothered by Derrida's work and commented: [...] "Those <b>substances</b> <b>that</b> we call drugs are <b>substances</b> <b>that</b> are well {{identified}} both on the pharmacological-botanical level and on the behavioural level".|$|R
5|$|Curie's {{systematic}} studies {{included two}} uranium minerals, pitchblende and torbernite (also known as chalcolite). Her electrometer showed that pitchblende was {{four times as}} active as uranium itself, and chalcolite twice as active. She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another <b>substance</b> <b>that</b> was far more active than uranium. She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive. Pierre was increasingly intrigued by her work. By mid-1898 he was so invested in it {{that he decided to}} drop his work on crystals and to join her.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene glycol {{has been}} shown to be toxic to humans and is also toxic to {{domestic}} pets such as cats and dogs. A toxic dose requiring medical treatment varies but is considered more than 0.1 mL per kg body weight (mL/kg) of pure <b>substance.</b> <b>That</b> is roughly 16 mL of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80kg adult and 4 mL for a 20kg child. Poison control centers often use more than a lick or taste in a child or more than a mouthful in an adult as a dose requiring hospital assessment.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Dr. Don Gregorio Chil y Naranjo {{discovered}} several incisions in some mummies that he speculated {{may have}} been used to remove the internal organs. Don Brothwell's work in 1969 confirmed that evisceration was a method used by the Guanche. Along with a team of other scientists, Brothwell conducted a pathological examination of a Guanche mummy. The examination revealed that the body had been eviscerated, then the abdominal and thoracic cavities had been packed with a mud-like <b>substance</b> <b>that</b> contained the bark of a pine tree. Some sort of packing was also applied subcutaneously, but the exact make-up of this particular embalming substance is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Jains {{believe that}} karma is a {{physical}} <b>substance</b> <b>that</b> is everywhere in the universe. Karma particles are attracted to the soul {{by the actions of}} that soul. Karma particles are attracted when we do, think, or say things, when we kill something, when we lie, when we steal and so on. Karma not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā). Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.|$|E
5|$|Other {{approaches}} {{have been suggested}} over time, including cooling the water under a tropical cyclone by towing icebergs into the tropical oceans. Other ideas range from covering the ocean in a <b>substance</b> <b>that</b> inhibits evaporation, dropping large quantities of ice into the eye at very early stages of development (so that the latent heat is absorbed by the ice, instead of being converted to kinetic energy that would feed the positive feedback loop), or blasting the cyclone apart with nuclear weapons. Project Cirrus even involved throwing dry ice on a cyclone. These approaches all suffer from one flaw above many others: tropical cyclones are simply too large and short-lived {{for any of the}} weakening techniques to be practical.|$|E
5|$|Phenomenalism is {{the theory}} that {{representations}} (or sense data) of external objects are all that exist. Such a view was briefly adopted by Bertrand Russell {{and many of the}} logical positivists during the early 20th century. A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic <b>substance</b> <b>that</b> is neither physical nor mental. The mental and physical would then both be properties of this neutral substance. Such a position was adopted by Baruch Spinoza and was popularized by Ernst Mach in the 19th century. This neutral monism, as it is called, resembles property dualism.|$|E
50|$|In 1815 Davy {{suggested}} <b>that</b> acids were <b>substances</b> <b>that</b> contained replaceable hydrogen ions;- hydrogen {{that could}} be partly or totally replaced by metals.
