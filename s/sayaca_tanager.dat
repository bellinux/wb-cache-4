50|$|Given the fruit's {{attractive}} {{color and}} the conspicuous display at the branch-tips, this tree appears to be distributed by birds which eat the fruit and spread the seeds. Perching birds, namely tanagers (Thraupidae), thrushes (Turdidae) and tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae), are most commonly seen to feed on the fruit. Some birds, such as the silver-beaked tanager (Ramphocelus carbo), prune off the seedcoat and eat it, discarding the seed, but most swallow the entire fruit. Species such as the swallow tanager (Tersina viridis) and the pale-breasted thrush (Turdus leucomelas), but perhaps most of all the <b>sayaca</b> <b>tanager</b> (Thraupis sayaca), appear to be particularly fond of them. Indeed, the <b>sayaca</b> <b>tanager</b> will defend richly fruiting A. glandulosa trees against similar-sized birds such as the blue dacnis (Dacnis cayana) or the red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus). It may be that at least locally, T. sayaca is crucial for the tree's reproduction and survival.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>sayaca</b> <b>tanager</b> (Thraupis sayaca) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thraupidae, the tanagers. It is a common {{resident}} in northeastern, central, and southeastern Brazil (sanha√ßo , [...] ), and Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and northeastern Argentina (where they are known as [...] or [...] ). A few are recorded from far southeastern Peru, but its status there is unclear, {{in part due to}} the potential of confusion with the very similar juveniles of the blue-grey tanager.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the movement of}} seeds transported by fruit-eating birds in an agricultural, fragmented landscape of the Atlantic forest of southeast Brazil, I asked which bird species are the main seed dispersers in such environment, and how they use the available habitats (small forest fragments, forest thickets, live fences, isolated trees, and active pastures) where they {{are most likely to}} drop the seeds they swallow the relative importance of fruit-eating birds as seed vectors was evaluated {{based on the number of}} fruit species eaten, the number of visits, and visitation rate to fruiting plants. Habitat use was accessed by recording the habitats where birds were seen or heard during walks conducted throughout the study area. Sixteen plant species were observed during 308. 3 plant-hours. Forty-one bird species were observed eating fruits in a total of 830 visits to fruiting plants. <b>Sayaca</b> <b>Tanagers</b> (Thraupis <b>sayaca)</b> and Pale-breasted Thrushes (Turdus leucomelas) ate the greatest number of fruit species, were the most frequent plant visitors in terms of number and rate of visits, and had a broad range of habitat use. These two species and the Rusty-margined Guan (Penelope superciliaris), which is able to swallow large fruits with large seeds that smaller bird species cannot cat, likely have a great contribution to the movement of seeds throughout this highly degraded landscape...|$|R
5000|$|Pollination {{is mainly}} by bats, and {{as usual in}} such cases the flowers {{do not have a}} {{pleasant}} smell but produce copious thin nectar. Flowers open in the evening and produce nectar throughout the night, ceasing in the early morning. As it seems, each night's last nectar, produced around dawn, is richer in sugars than that produced in the night, though it is much less in quantity already. Moths, nocturnal wasps and ants also visit the flowers at night; the former two might also do some pollinating but they are not known to be of major importance. During the day, the flowers are visited by bees and wasps which feed on remaining pollen. From dusk to the cessation of nectar production, hummingbirds may visit the flowers. While most of them only do this opportunistically, some species [...] - [...] e.g. the fork-tailed woodnymph (Thalurania furcata) and in particular the glittering-throated emerald (Amazilia fimbriata) [...] - [...] appear to visit pequi tree flowers on a regular base. More significantly, visits by small [...] "tanagers" [...] of the Thraupidae and Cardinalidae families around dusk are noted. In particular species like the guira tanager (Hemithraupis guira), white-lined tanager (Tachyphonus rufus) and the palm (Thraupis palmarum) and <b>sayaca</b> <b>tanagers</b> (T. <b>sayaca)</b> seem to be quite fond of pequi flower nectar and spend considerable time feeding on it when available. But even curl-crested jays (Cyanocorax cristatellus) have been observed to hang about flowering pequi trees at daybreak, though perhaps not just for the nectar, considering many insects attracted by it earlier would still be around on the tree. As the stigmata dry out at daybreak, {{it is not clear whether}} birds, particularly tanagers, play a role in pollination also or are merely making use of an easy early-morning snack, particularly considering that during the flowering season of C. brasiliense, little such food is available.|$|R
