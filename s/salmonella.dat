40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that Menhaden fish meal, a common {{ingredient}} of animal feeds, is frequently contaminated with <b>salmonellae.</b> Animals that eat contaminated feed may become infected. If they, in turn, are eaten by humans, they may be a means by which <b>salmonellae</b> are introduced into the human population. Epidemiological studies of the fish-meal industry were carried out to determine the sources of <b>salmonellae</b> in fish meal and the factors affecting the persistence and survival of <b>salmonellae</b> during the processing of fish meal. Examination of 190 fish immediately after they came from the Gulf of Mexico revealed no <b>salmonellae,</b> but <b>salmonellae</b> were frequently isolated from samples of fish taken from the boats when they arrived at the plants. <b>Salmonellae</b> were also frequently isolated from dockside water at each of the plants. Approximately 50 % of the samples taken in the raw fish processing areas were contaminated with <b>salmonellae.</b> The percentage of samples yielding <b>salmonellae</b> decreased progressively through the various sequences of processing, but more than 15 % of the samples taken from the finished products were also positive. <b>Salmonellae</b> were isolated from the raw area of the plant most frequently while the plant was operating and less frequently when the plant was idle, whereas in the processing area of the plant the reverse was true. <b>Salmonellae</b> appeared to survive and multiply in the processing area of the plant while the plant was idle, which resulted in contamination of the first portion of each day's production. <b>Salmonellae</b> in the processed fish meal were reduced to nondetectable levels by reprocessing the first 45 min of each day's production...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>salmonellae</b> in contrasting environments was compared in this study. Samples collected from or near surface waters in a lush hardwood forest yielded four <b>salmonellae</b> serotypes from six culturally positive samples. A total of 76 samples {{collected from the}} top of a granite outcropping over a 3 -month period yielded 10 positive samples. Only two <b>salmonellae</b> serotypes were isolated, and one of these was isolated only once. The nature of the sample material had no significant effect on the detection of <b>salmonellae</b> from the two sampling sites. However, {{the presence or absence of}} visible moisture in the sample significantly affected the recovery of <b>salmonellae.</b> The results showed that even a harsh environment such as that found on top of Stone Mountain may serve as an ecological niche for the survival and transmission of <b>salmonellae...</b>|$|R

5|$|Keeping rats as pets {{can come}} with the stigma that rats {{supposedly}} transmit dangerous diseases to their owners. One fear is that all rats carry plague, when in fact R. norvegicus is not among the list of species considered a threat. In 2004, an outbreak of <b>salmonella</b> in the United States was connected to people who owned pet rats. However, it has been determined that a pet rat's initial exposure to <b>salmonella,</b> {{along with many other}} zoonotic rat diseases, typically indicates exposure to wild rodent populations, either from an infestation in the owner's home, or from the pet's contaminated food, water, or bedding.|$|E

40|$|Composted {{sewage sludge}} {{may be used}} to improve soil quality, but there remains some doubt {{concerning}} the microbiological safety of the product. Sewage sludge composts from 30 municipalities were sampled, and four samples (12 %) contained <b>salmonellae</b> (two contained fewer than 0. 3 /g, and the other two had 21 /g and 1. 7 X 10 (4) /g). All 30 composts were inoculated with salmonellae; the populations decreased at a specific death rate of about 0. 15 h- 1 over 24 h at 36 degrees C. In irradiation-sterilized composts inoculated with <b>salmonellae,</b> the <b>salmonellae</b> grew at a rate of 0. 65 doublings per h for over 24 h. Growth and death rates were found to be moisture and flora associated. The growth or death rates for antibiotic-resistant <b>salmonellae</b> were not different from those of nonresistant strains. It was concluded that the active indigenous flora of compost establishes a homeostatic barrier to colonization by <b>salmonellae,</b> {{and in the absence of}} competing flora, reinoculated <b>salmonellae</b> may grow to potentially hazardous densities. The active microflora of moist composts eliminated contaminating <b>salmonellae</b> (10 (5) /g) after 6 weeks...|$|R
40|$|Cecal {{droppings}} {{from four}} commercial turkey flocks (two flocks of hens and two flocks of toms) were analyzed {{for the presence}} of naturally occurring <b>salmonellae</b> at ages 6, 10, and 15 weeks and {{for the presence of}} Campylobacter spp. at ages 3, 6, 10, and 15 weeks. The <b>salmonellae</b> contamination rates in these turkey flocks appeared to be somewhat different from that observed in broiler production. With broilers, <b>salmonellae</b> contamination in cecal droppings typically peaks at about 3 weeks of age and then steadily declines to almost zero prior to processing. In this study, the presence of <b>salmonellae</b> remained through grow-out (40 % in toms and 13 % in hens at 15 weeks of age). Campylobacter was maintained in a high percentage of turkey cecal droppings though production (77 % in toms and 80 % in hens at 15 weeks of age), which is similar to the trend observed for broilers. For Campylobacter and <b>salmonellae,</b> the percentage of positive droppings was slightly higher for toms than for hens. Overall, a higher percentage of commercial turkeys, regardless of sex, had Campylobacter in their ceca and intestinal tract as opposed to <b>salmonellae.</b> For toms, 80 % were Campylobacter positive, and only 31. 1 % were <b>salmonellae</b> positive. For hens, 70 % were Campylobacter positive, and only 17. 7 % were <b>salmonellae</b> positive...|$|R

5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is host {{to a huge}} number of parasites and diseases, and the effect of most is unknown. Ornithologist Ted R. Anderson listed thousands, noting that his list was incomplete. The {{commonly}} recorded bacterial pathogens of the house sparrow are often those common in humans, and include <b>Salmonella</b> and Escherichia coli. <b>Salmonella</b> is common in the house sparrow, and a comprehensive study of house sparrow disease found it in 13% of sparrows tested. <b>Salmonella</b> epidemics in the spring and winter can kill large numbers of sparrows. The house sparrow hosts avian pox and avian malaria, which it has spread to the native forest birds of Hawaii. Many of the diseases hosted by the house sparrow are also present in humans and domestic animals, for which the house sparrow acts as a reservoir host. Arboviruses such as the West Nile virus, which most commonly infect insects and mammals, survive winters in temperate areas by going dormant in birds such as the house sparrow. A few records indicate disease extirpating house sparrow populations, especially from Scottish islands, but this seems to be rare.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Trisodium {{phosphate}} (TSP) {{has been}} re- into plastic bags with 500 mL of {{buffered peptone water}} ported to decrease the recovery of <b>salmonellae</b> from processed poultry carcasses. It {{has been suggested that}} the high pH and detergent-like properties of TSP solutions are responsible for the reduction in <b>salmonellae</b> recovery. This project was conducted to determine if controlling pH during <b>salmonellae</b> pre-enrichment alters the effect of TSP on <b>salmonellae</b> recovery. Carcasses were obtained from a commercial processing plant immediately after the final inside-outside carcass washer, prior to any other antimicrobial treatments, and before chilling. Carcasses were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: 1) TSP and alkaline pre-enrichment, 2) TSP and neutral pre-enrichment, 3) non-TSP and alkaline pre-enrichment, 4) non-TSP and neutral pre-enrichment. Carcasses were placed (with or without pH adjustment) and shaken for 1 min. Preincubation pH of the rinsate was measured. Carcasses were incubated in the rinse at 37 °C for 24 h, and incidence of <b>salmonellae</b> was determined. The pH of the preincubation rinsate was 8. 4 for the TSP alkaline pre-enrichment, 7. 2 for the TSP neutral pre-enrichment, 8. 6 for the non-TSP alkaline pre-enrichment, and 7. 1 for the non-TSP neutral pre-enrichment. <b>Salmonellae</b> were detected from 40 % of the TSP alkaline pre-enrichment carcasses, 44 % of the TSP neutral pre-enrichment carcasses, 54 % of the non-TSP alkaline pre-enrichment carcasses, and 38 % of the non-TSP neutral pre-enrichment carcasses. Neither TSP treatment nor pre-enrichment pH adjustment significantly influenced carcass <b>salmonellae</b> detection...|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{has been}} developed for the enumeration of <b>salmonellae</b> in polluted waters using several modifications of existing techniques. Confirmation of <b>salmonellae</b> is achieved within 48 hr. This procedure includes selective enrichment in m-Tetrathionate Broth (22 ± 1 hr), plating on Brilliant Green Sulfa Agar (20 ± 1 hr), and confirmation by flagellar (H) agglutination of the growth in a mannosecontaining medium (6 ± 1 hr). An incubation temperature of 41. 5 C was used throughout this procedure. Dilution to extinction techniques (most probable number) were employed to enumerate <b>salmonellae.</b> Large sample volumes were concentrated {{through the use of}} membrane filters.

5|$|Domesticated rats are physiologically {{and psychologically}} {{different}} from their wild relatives, and—when acquired from reputable breeders and shops—pose no more of a health risk than other common pets. For example, domesticated brown rats are not considered a disease threat, while exposure to wild rat populations could introduce pathogens like <b>Salmonella</b> into the home.

40|$|It {{has been}} found in Australia and in the United States that {{composting}} does not always result in the complete removal of <b>salmonellae</b> from biosolids.

At present rapid methods of detection such as PCR and ELISA are not sufficiently developed to monitor environmental samples. The relative efficiency of various culture methods for detecting <b>salmonellae</b> in composted biosolids was therefore investigated. On the basis of the results a presence/absence method is recommended for the detection of <b>salmonellae</b> in biosolids products.

40|$|<b>Salmonellae</b> in the {{environment}} remain a potential source of disease. Low numbers of <b>salmonellae</b> have been detected and enumerated from environmental samples by most-probable-number methods which require careful colony selection from a plated agar medium. A modified xylose lysine brilliant green medium was prepared to control the loss of selectivity caused by heating the brilliant green component. Added agar reduced colony spreading. The medium contained 47 g of xylose lysine agar base per liter; the agar content was adjusted to 2 %, autoclaved, cooled to 50 degrees C, and then amended just before pouring to include H 2 S indicator and 7 ppm (7 ml of 1 : 1, 000 brilliant green per liter) of unheated brilliant green dye. H 2 S-positive <b>salmonellae</b> were easily detected from sewage sludge compost {{to the exclusion of}} most other gram-negative bacteria. As a result, fewer non-salmonellae were picked for further most-probable-number analysis, greatly reducing the work load associated with the most-probable-number method.

25|$|In produce, {{microorganisms}} {{attach to}} the surfaces and biofilms develop internally.

The bacteria can spoil the products more readily and contaminated products pose a health risk to consumers. One bacteria that can be found in various industries and is a major cause of foodborne disease is <b>Salmonella.</b> Large amounts of <b>salmonella</b> contamination {{can be found in the}} poultry processing industry as about 50% of <b>salmonella</b> strains can produce biofilms on poultry farms. <b>Salmonella</b> increases the risk of foodborne illnesses when the poultry products are not cleaned and cooked correctly. <b>Salmonella</b> is also found in the seafood industry where biofilms form from seafood borne pathogens on the seafood itself as well as in water.
