5|$|Casting {{began in}} October 2007, when Priyanka Chopra signed {{to play the}} lead role in the film. Chopra {{initially}} refused the role, feeling {{she would not be}} able to do it justice. Six months later, <b>she</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> appear in the film because of Bhandarkar's confidence in her. The media reported that Chopra was unhappy with the first draft of the film and wanted script changes before signing the film. Bhandarkar was also unhappy with the first draft and agreed to rewrite the script. Kangana Ranaut was cast as the film's second lead; she was pleased with the script and found it challenging, interesting and exciting. In December 2007, Arbaaz Khan and Arjan Bajwa were cast opposite Chopra. After confirming the principal cast, the media reported that Bhandarkar was having difficulty casting the male roles, including that of a homosexual clothing designer. Samir Soni and Harsh Chhaya were cast as the homosexual designers, and model Mugdha Godse was cast in a supporting role. According to Godse, Bhandarkar offered her a part when they were shooting a jewellery advertisement; a year later, <b>she</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> appear in the film. The Hindustan Times said that several models and designers played themselves, giving the film the appearance of a documentary.|$|E
5|$|Ganesan {{originally}} {{offered the}} role of Vellaiyathevan to S. S. Rajendran, who declined it due to {{his commitment to the}} film Sivagangai Seemai (1959).

Gemini Ganesan was initially reluctant to accept the role, but eventually agreed. Padmini, O. A. K. Thevar, and V. K. Ramasamy were chosen to play Vellaiyammal, Oomaithurai and Ettappan respectively.

Eventually, Turner agreed to make the film, but did not start production until March due to having to lose weight.|$|E
5|$|Siva is Nagarjuna's 17th film as an actor. Varma {{found him}} the only actor who could {{understand}} his perspective. Nagarjuna and Varma had discussed astronomy and realised that they shared similar sensibilities. That, and Varma's passion for and dedication to films, prompted Nagarjuna {{to work with}} him. Amala, who worked with Nagarjuna in Prema Yuddham (1990), {{was chosen as the}} female lead. Siva was the first film in her career where the script was explained shot by shot. When Varma approached Rohini to dub Amala's portions, <b>she</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> dub for Amala only after watching about three reels of footage.|$|E
5|$|Even though Lana {{eventually}} marries Lex {{in season}} six, Al Gough argues that Lana still loved Clark and Clark still loved her. The only reason Lana was with Lex was because Clark forced {{her in that}} direction and she ended up getting in over her head. By contrast, writer Caroline Dries feels that Lana did love Lex, and {{that she did not}} make any hasty decisions when <b>she</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> marry him. Dries believes that the progression of the show demonstrates that Lex earned Lana's love. To answer viewers that hated to see Lana marry Lex, Dries contends that as viewers we are seeing all of Lex, including how evil he truly is, while Lana only sees the portion of Lex that appears good.|$|E

5|$|In 1330 Sir John de Mohun {{inherited}} the castle; John, although a notable knight, was childless {{and fell into}} considerable debt.

At some point during this period additional stone buildings were constructed along the Lower Ward, {{on the side of}} the current mansion, and records suggest that a ditch, or moat, may have existed around the base of the Tor in the 14th century.|$|E
5|$|In January 1995, Qubilah Shabazz {{was charged}} with trying to hire an assassin to kill Farrakhan in {{retaliation}} for the murder of her father. Farrakhan surprised the Shabazz family when he defended Qubilah, saying he did not think she was guilty and that he hoped she would not be convicted. That May, Betty Shabazz and Farrakhan shook hands on the stage of the Apollo Theater during a public event intended to raise money for Qubilah's legal defense. Some heralded the evening as a reconciliation between the two, but others thought Shabazz was doing whatever she had to in order to protect her daughter. Regardless, nearly $250,000 was raised that evening. In the aftermath, Shabazz maintained a cool relationship with Farrakhan, although <b>she</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> speak at his Million Man March that October.|$|E

By 1884, they were meeting regularly, and in 1885, after an initial rejection, <b>she</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> marry him. The wedding took place at the Herron home on June 19, 1886.

5|$|Kohli {{had been}} in discussions with Chopra for a {{different}} project before, which would have paired her with Saif Ali Khan. At that time, Khan and Chopra {{had been asked to}} star together in a number of films, including 2 States, Cocktail, Race 2 and Vishal Bhardwaj's Dreams. Siddharth Anand's adaptation of 2 States would film {{at the same time as}} Kohli's proposed film. Anand and Kohli met and agreed that Chopra would act in 2 States. Later, Kohli approached Chopra with a new script, and <b>she</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> join the cast for Teri Meri Kahaani.

According to her son Madison's memoir, Hemings became pregnant by Jefferson in Paris. She was about 16 at the time. <b>She</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> return with him to the United States based on his promise to free their children when they reached the age of 21 years.
