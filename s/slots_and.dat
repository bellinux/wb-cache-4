5|$|The M249 LMG entered {{service in}} 1984 as the M249 SAW. Initial {{reactions}} to the gun were mixed: it fulfilled the light machine gun role well when fired from the ground, but was not as effective when fired from the shoulder or hip. It was praised for its extreme durability and massive firepower, though {{a number of areas}} for improvement were highlighted: the blank firing attachment fitted poorly, the bipod was very weak and broke easily, the sling attachment was awkward, and there were many <b>slots</b> <b>and</b> gaps that accumulated dirt. Some claimed that the heavy-barrelled version of the M16 rifle was a more effective light machine gun.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{traditional}} visual {{novels that}} consist of static characters with subtitled dialogue, School Days {{is unusual in}} that it incorporates motion and voice, making it reminiscent of an animated series. Cinematics naturally play on their own, and players are afforded the ability to pause, fast-forward, and even skip those they've seen before. Male and female voices can be muted, subtitles can be turned on or off and the game can be played from a window or fullscreen ratio. Progress can be saved {{at any time in}} up to 100 <b>slots</b> <b>and</b> loaded from either the main menu or during play.|$|E
5|$|Boeing 737-700s {{were taken}} into use {{starting}} in 1998, and the company rebranded from Braathens SAFE to Braathens. That year also saw the opening of Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which increased Braathens number of <b>slots</b> <b>and</b> allowed them {{to start a new}} route to Haugesund. Braathens started a costly price war with its competitors Color Air and SAS; after Color Air went bankrupt in 1999, Braathens started terminating routes, and the Swedish division was merged into the subsidiary Malmö Aviation. Málaga and Alicante were introduced as destinations in 2000. The next year, Braathens was bought by the SAS Group, and in 2002, the routes were split between SAS and Braathens. The latter kept only four international routes, but was granted new services to Northern Norway: Alta, Bardufoss, Kirkenes and Lakselv. Braathens was merged with SAS to create SAS Braathens in 2004.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, Shepard ran for an at-large {{seat on the}} Philadelphia City Council. By {{the rules}} of the limited voting system for the at-large seats, each {{political}} party could nominate five candidates and voters could only vote for five, with the result being that the majority party could only take five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party. Shepard won one of the five Democratic <b>slots</b> <b>and</b> was easily elected. On the council, he served as head of the public works committee. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Shepard initially opposed the change, but later voted in favor after party leaders promised him more black Democrats would get political appointments. The amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to make it on to the ballot for popular approval but failed in a vote that April.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, Penn National Gaming bought Rosecroft for $10.25 million. Penn National said it {{planned to}} return live racing and {{simulcast}} wagering {{to the track}} as well as pushing for changes in Maryland gaming laws allowing <b>slots</b> <b>and</b> table games. Penn National said it was hoping to convince the state to allow slot machines at the track, even though voters did not approve Prince George's County as a gambling location. On July 28, 2011, the Maryland Racing Commission agreed to allow Penn National Gaming to secure a $1.4 million line of credit to cover operating losses at Rosecroft for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. Penn National said it was likely to incur $2.3 million in losses through 2013.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} terminal building, both the airport's location and surrounding infrastructure were {{the subject of much}} complaint as well. For one, although some 1,700 cars visited the airport daily, the parking lot had only 129 <b>slots,</b> <b>and</b> could not be expanded any further. The airport complex likewise was located directly alongside major city thoroughfares, in particular the city's main highway, the Tomas Confesor Highway, which complicated the flow of traffic in and around the area. At one point, the ATO, which was already having difficulty managing vehicular traffic around the airport, proposed banning cargo and delivery trucks from passing through the road in front of the terminal building. However, the city government did not respond.|$|E

5|$|Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is a {{survival}} horror game where the player controls the protagonist Jill Valentine from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} the environment and enemies. Aside from Jill, the player takes control of another character for a brief portion of the game. To advance through the game, the player has to explore a city while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating various types of enemies. The player can interact with the environment in several ways, such as opening doors, pushing objects or climbing obstacles. Scattered throughout the city are weapons, ammunition and other items, which can be collected and put in the player's inventory. Items can be examined, used, or combined with others. The inventory is limited to a certain number of <b>slots,</b> <b>and</b> the player must often move items from the inventory to a storage box located in special rooms to manage space.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{is faced}} with red sandstone, and has lead, asphalt and tile roofs. It is mainly in three storeys with a five-storey tower. The {{buildings}} are arranged around a ward with the principal accommodation on the north side. It {{is surrounded by a}} dry moat which is bridged at the gatehouse. To the west of the inner ward are the stables, the coach house, a rectangular bell tower and the kitchens and service area. To the north is the great hall range which consists of 18bays. Behind the entrance to the hall is the circular main tower. At the east end of the gallery wing is the octagonal library tower. The outer walls of the castle have full-height slender turrets at the changes in direction. Corbel tables support part of the battlements. The walls contain arrow <b>slots,</b> <b>and</b> in the gatehouse is a garderobe. The flat roof has a crenellated parapet.|$|E

5|$|On 19 June 1990, SAS {{announced}} that all its services to London Gatwick Airport would {{be moved to}} London Heathrow Airport, where most of its services had landed. The same day, the Ministry of Transport {{announced that}} any Scandinavian airline could apply for and receive concessions to fly to Gatwick. On 25 June, Braathens SAFE applied to fly to London, but instead wanted to fly to London Stansted Airport, to have better landing slots. The concession was granted on 18 January 1991, but the airline chose to not start the route. The company had been granted a concession to Malmø in Sweden, and the route opened on 2 May 1991 with two daily departures. This was later reduced to one. In October 1992, the two airlines that flew from Oslo to Gatwick, Norway Airlines and Dan-Air, filed for bankcruptcy. Braathens SAFE immediately decided to start the route, with a departure at about 10:30 that would allow connections {{to the rest of}} the domestic network. Six days later, the first schedules were published in the newspaper, <b>slots</b> <b>and</b> British permission was granted three days after that. Another two days after that, the service started.|$|E
