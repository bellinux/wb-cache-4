Lavinia recognized the poems' worth and became obsessed with seeing them published. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> first to her brother's wife and then to Mabel Loomis Todd, her brother's mistress, for assistance.

5|$|Annalee Call was {{originally}} written for Angelina Jolie; although Jolie auditioned, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> down {{the role and}} Winona Ryder was cast in December 1996. Call had a generally negative critical reception, largely due to a perceived lack of synergy with the film and the franchise. Roger Ebert praised Ryder's acting, but felt {{that she did not}} bring a strong presence or purpose to the film except as a familiar face to younger viewers. Nordling agreed in a 2012 Ain't It Cool News analysis, saying that Call's synthetic origin is unnecessary and her only role is that of a surrogate audience.|$|E

At the very crucial time when she should be coming to a state of pure equilibrium and rest with her husband, <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> rabidly against rest or peace or equilibrium or husband in any shape or form, and demands more love, more love, a new sort of lover, one who will [...] "understand" [...] her.
