Typically, Irens' designs synthesise traditional forms with modern materials and methods of construction, with Carbon fibre masts, laminated frames, and epoxied <b>strip</b> <b>wood</b> strongly in evidence.|$|E
50|$|New York's Democrats {{were divided}} into two camps: those who {{supported}} Mayor Fernando Wood and those who opposed him. The Bowery gangs were among the latter, while the Dead Rabbits were supporters of Wood. Thus, the Bowery Boys threw their support in league with state Republicans, who proposed legislation that would <b>strip</b> <b>Wood</b> of certain powers and place them in the hands of Albany. One of these proposals was to disband the Municipal Police Department, in which Wood's supporters had a controlling interest, {{and replace it with a}} state-run Metropolitan Police Department. Wood refused to disband his Municipal Department, and so for the first half of 1857, the two rival departments battled it out on the streets of the city until the courts ordered the Municipals to disband that July. On July 4 a bloody fight, the Dead Rabbits Riot, occurred with the Metropolitan Police and the Bowery gangs against the Municipal Police, Mulberry Street Boys, Roach Guards, and Dead Rabbits in Bayard Street. After the American Civil War Draft Riots of 1863 the Dead Rabbits power started to decline and eventually they were absorbed into new Irish criminal gangs rising up to take their place.|$|E

5000|$|Wallace Wally Wood's 1st wife {{recalled}} in the Eisner Award recognized Wood biography Wally's World {{that it was}} Jack Kirby who sought out the famous science-fiction artist to collaborate on Sky Masters. Wallace Wood had proven to be American comics' best science-fiction artist through his landmark work on EC's Weird Science, Weird Fantasy and Wood was invited by Will Eisner to collaborate on the Outer Space Spirit newspaper series. By the time, Kirby was thinking about a space <b>strip,</b> <b>Wood</b> had given up comicbook work for higher paying magazine and advertising work including Mad and illustrating top science-fiction authors in Galaxy, Worlds of If and other magazines and books. But Wallace Wally Wood was happy to accept Kirby's invitation. With art samples and story outline approved by Elmlark, Kirby penciled the strip, which was initially written by brothers Dick & Dave Wood and inked by the unrelated Wally Wood; at that same time, Dave Wood was also working with Kirby on the Showcase Comics issues of Kirby's [...] "Challengers of the Unknown" [...] feature for DC Comics, and Wally Wood would later ink issues #2-8 of Kirby's Challengers of the Unknown comic book series during {{the last half of}} 1958 and the first half of 1959.

Later [...] "Sky Masters" [...] strips were written by Kirby, and inked by Dick Ayers, with the final month penciled and inked by Kirby alone.|$|E

50|$|Steam bending is a {{woodworking}} technique where <b>strips</b> of <b>wood</b> are steam heated using a steam box. The applied {{heat and}} moisture makes the wood pliable enough to easily bend around a former {{to create a}} specific shape. The moulding process is usually done by clamping the <b>strips</b> of <b>wood</b> to a positive form, with the <b>strips</b> of <b>wood</b> often reinforced on the outside with a metal band to prevent blowout. The method {{has been used in}} the manufacturing of a diverse range of products, some examples being wooden boat building where it is used in the shaping of hull's ribs and lap boards, the production of traditional wooden lacrosse sticks, musical instruments such as violins and in the manufacture of wooden furniture like the Windsor chair and much of Michael Thonet's work.|$|R

Candlewood Lake was named for the Native American practice of using <b>stripped</b> <b>wood</b> from pine trees as kindling for fire.
