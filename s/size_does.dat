5|$|Many {{species of}} birdlice are {{present on the}} birds and in their nests, and mites of the genus Knemidocoptes {{have been known to}} infest populations, {{resulting}} in lesions on the legs and toes. Parasitisation of nestlings by Protocalliphora blow-fly larvae is a significant factor in nestling mortality. Egg <b>size</b> <b>does</b> not influence nestling mortality, but chicks from large eggs grow faster.|$|E

Whitetips follow schools of tuna or squid, and trail groups of {{cetaceans}} such as dolphins and pilot whales, scavenging their prey. Their instinct is to follow baitfish migrations that accompany ocean-going ships. When whaling took place in warm waters, oceanic whitetips were often responsible {{for much of the}} damage to floating carcasses.|$|E
5|$|Painting {{on linen}} cloth using glue size as a binder {{was at the}} time a {{relatively}} inexpensive alternative to oil, and a large number of works were produced in the 15th century. Glue <b>size</b> <b>does</b> not saturate the pigments as much as oil, allowing them to show as matt and opaque, giving – especially with reds and blues – an intense appearance when applied to cloth. Cloth is fragile and perishes easily, and this work {{is one of the best}} preserved of the few surviving examples of the technique from the period; the majority extant today were executed on wood using oil or egg tempera. Curtains or glass were often used to protect glue-sized works.|$|E

5|$|In vertebrates, {{the part}} of the brain that plays the {{greatest}} role is the hypothalamus, a small region at the base of the forebrain whose <b>size</b> <b>does</b> not reflect its complexity or the importance of its function. The hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei, most of which are involved in basic biological functions. Some of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality, aggression, or maternal behaviors; but many of them relate to homeostasis. Several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in the lining of blood vessels, conveying information about temperature, sodium level, glucose level, blood oxygen level, and other parameters. These hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies. Some of the outputs also go to the pituitary gland, a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland secretes hormones into the bloodstream, where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{peppered}} maskray lacks {{economic value}} and is discarded by fisheries. It is often caught incidentally in bottom trawls, {{and due to}} its small <b>size</b> <b>does</b> not benefit from Turtle Exclusion Devices. In particular, this species accounts for approximately 4.5% of the total catch of the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF) in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Over half of the rays caught by the NPF, including almost all the males, are fatally crushed within the trawl. Despite this mortality, the NPF is not believed to have negatively affected the local population because its operational area {{does not include the}} waters where this species is most abundant. The peppered maskray is also caught frequently in scallop trawls operated by the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery. Elsewhere in its range, fishing pressure is relatively light due to external factors such as fuel prices. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, because it remains common and its range includes several Marine Protected Areas.|$|E

25|$|Surgeons {{who perform}} {{more of the}} {{operations}} each year tend to have fewer patients dislocate. Doing the surgery from an anterior approach seems to lower dislocation rates when small diameter heads are used, but the benefit has not been shown when compared to modern posterior incisions {{with the use of}} larger diameter heads. The use of larger diameter head <b>size</b> <b>does</b> in it self decrease the risk of dislocation, even though this correlation is only found in head sizes up to 28 mm, thereafter no additional decrease in dislocation rate is found. Patients can decrease the risk further by keeping the leg out of certain positions during the first few months after surgery.|$|E

2500|$|The {{androgenic}} {{effects of}} AAS are numerous. Depending {{on the length}} of use, the side effects of the steroid can be irreversible. Processes affected include pubertal growth, sebaceous gland oil production, and sexuality (especially in fetal development). Some examples of virilizing effects are growth of the clitoris in females and the penis in male children (the adult penis <b>size</b> <b>does</b> not change due to steroids [...] ), increased vocal cord size, increased libido, suppression of natural sex hormones, and impaired production of sperm. Effects on women include deepening of the voice, facial hair growth, and possibly a decrease in breast size. Men may develop an enlargement of breast tissue, known as gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and a reduced sperm count.|$|E
2500|$|The {{size of the}} {{particle}} is a main determinant of where in the respiratory tract {{the particle}} will come to rest when inhaled.

[...] The 10 micrometer <b>size</b> <b>does</b> not represent a strict boundary between respirable and non-respirable particles, but has been agreed upon for monitoring of airborne particulate matter by most regulatory agencies.

2500|$|In some countries, {{especially}} Australia, Canada, the UK, and the U.S., broadsheet {{newspapers are}} commonly {{perceived to be}} more intellectual in content than their tabloid counterparts. [...] They tend to use their greater size to publish stories exploring topics in depth, while carrying less sensationalist and celebrity-oriented material.

On 29 November 2011, Army General Nikolay Makarov, Chief of the Russian General Staff, said that Russian ships in the Mediterranean were due to exercises rather than events in Syria, and noted that Kuznetsovs <b>size</b> <b>does</b> not allow it to moor in Tartus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{morphological}} {{differences in}} P. exigua queens and workers become more distinct as the colony cycle progresses. There are fewer differences within early stage colonies, and correspondingly greater discriminations among later stage colonies. In addition, physical discrepancies between wasp castes are more prominent in colonies {{with a smaller}} number of queens. [...] P. exigua queens are generally easier to identify, while it is harder to distinguish between workers and intermediates. The thoracic labial gland is better developed in workers than in queens, but wasp brain <b>size</b> <b>does</b> not differ between castes. Both inseminated and non-inseminated P. exigua females exhibit a greater presence among colonies that frequently experience nest destruction. This might be because nest destruction uncouples the colony cycle from the nesting cycle and can also cause colonies to separate when this might not otherwise have occurred. Males are identified by the presence of testes. Queen body size and relative fecundity seem to be important determinants of queen success within a given colony.|$|E
