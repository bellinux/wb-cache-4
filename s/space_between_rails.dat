Selects degree of restraint to suit task at hand. Movements to enter and leave foot restraint simple and direct. Simply forces each cleat lightly into <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>rails</b> until spring force of movable rail secures it. Body movements for sliding and rotation equally straightforward. Designed for use in absence of gravitation, restraint useful on Earth, underwater or in some hazardous locations where movements restricted...|$|E

40|$|Non-lubricated ball {{bearings}} featuring rail races {{have been proposed}} for use in mechanisms that are required to function {{in the presence of}} mineral dust particles in very low-pressure, dry environments with extended life. Like a conventional ball bearing, the proposed bearing would include an inner and an outer ring separated by balls in rolling contact with the races. However, unlike a conventional ball bearing, the balls would not roll in semi-circular or gothic arch race grooves in the rings: instead, the races would be shaped to form two or more rails (see figure). During operation, the motion of the balls would push dust particles into the <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> the <b>rails</b> where the particles could not generate rolling resistance for the ball...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} LayTracks, a new mesh generation algorithm {{to automatically}} generate an all quad mesh using the medial axis transform(MAT). LayTracks combines {{the merits of}} two popular direct techniques for quad mesh generation - Quad meshing by decomposition and Advancing front quad meshing. The algorithm uses the MAT to lay rails across an arbitrary set of connected planar patches. Each rail starts from a node on the boundary and propagates towards the MA and then from the MA towards the boundary. Quadrilateral elements are then obtained by placing nodes on these rails and connecting them inside each track formed by adjacent <b>rails.</b> <b>Spacing</b> <b>between</b> the <b>rails</b> and <b>between</b> the nodes on the rails are xed at the boundary of the region. The medial axis therefore serves as the natural termination for the propagation of both the rail and the mesh. The algorithm uses the medial axis transform to both decompose the region and avoid the expensive interference checks of advancing [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{there is}} no {{standard}} for the depth of equipment, nor specifying the outer width and depth of the rack enclosure itself (incorporating the structure, doors and panels that contain the mounting rails), {{there is a tendency}} for 4-post racks to be 600 mm or 800 mm wide, and for them to be 600 mm, 800 mm or 1010 mm deep. This of course varies by manufacturer, the design of the rack and its purpose, but through common constraining factors (such as raised floor tile dimensions), these dimensions have become quite common. The extra width and depth enables cabling to be routed with ease (also helping to maintain bend-radius for fibre and copper cables) and deeper equipment to be utilised. A common feature in IT racks are mounting positions for [...] "Zero-U" [...] accessories, such as PDU (power distribution units) and vertical cable managers/ducts, that utilise the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> the rear <b>rails</b> and the side of the rack enclosure.|$|R

40|$|Transportation {{systems are}} {{the glue that}} binds {{together}} American cities. From the first boulevard, through the horse-drawn streetcars of the 19 th Century, through the electric trolleys of the early 1990 s, to the freeways of the post-World War II era, transportation investments have long played a defining role in guiding the growth and development of metropolitan areas. What is today called the “transportation-land use connection” has been the object of study by geographers and economists for more than 150 years, and {{the focus of attention}} for developers and speculators for even longer. This report explores the transit-land use connection from the transit side. Drawing on data for five urban rail transit systems here in California (BART, CalTrain, Sacramento Light Rail, the San Diego Trolley, and Santa Clara Light Rail), it uses statistical models to clarify the relationships between transit investments, land uses, and property values. Four types of transit-land use/ property value relationships are considered: - Relationships <b>between</b> <b>rail</b> transit investments and single-family home prices; - Relationships <b>between</b> <b>rail</b> transit investments and commercial property values; - Relationships <b>between</b> <b>rail</b> transit investments and station area land use changes; and, - Relationships <b>between</b> <b>rail</b> transit investments and metropolitan-scale land use changes In the policy context, this report responds to policy questions. The first is fiscal in nature; the second relates to issues of development policy. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. F. A.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2006. In my Nana's house ghosts {{lived in}} the cracks between the boards in the walls. Running my hand along tongue and groove one by sixes, I could feel the spirits waiting in the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> the boards. My hands {{skipping}} over those in-between spaces again and again brought me closer to them. Often, while lying on her bed and at night as I slept, I {{was aware of the}} <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> where spirits of ancestors waited and whispered. In remembrance of my grandmother's house, I built with wood and paper and glass my own <b>space</b> <b>between.</b> Ke Kowa the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> is meant to recreate that ghost space, a physical space to be navigated by the body to "see" and move through all that the memory of my Nana's house represented. A kowa is a crack, an opening, a crevice in time and space and understanding. The <b>space</b> <b>between</b> of which I speak, write and build functions as connector and divider, boundary and bond, contact and union. These <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> are separation, meeting, and communion.
