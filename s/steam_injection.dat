25|$|In recent years, {{a variant}} has emerged, {{producing}} what {{is sometimes called}} the steam bagel. To make a steam bagel, the boiling is skipped, and the bagels are instead baked in an oven equipped with a <b>steam</b> <b>injection</b> system. In commercial bagel production, the steam bagel process requires less labor, since bagels need only be directly handled once, at the shaping stage. Thereafter, the bagels need never be removed from their pans as they are refrigerated and then steam-baked. The steam bagel is {{not considered to be}} a genuine bagel by purists, as it results in a fluffier, softer, less chewy product more akin to a finger roll that happens to be shaped like a bagel. Steam bagels are considered lower quality by purists as the dough used is intentionally more alkaline. The increase in pH is to aid browning, since the <b>steam</b> <b>injection</b> process uses neutral water steam instead of an alkaline solution bath.|$|E
25|$|Vapor Extraction Process (VAPEX) is an in situ technology, {{similar to}} SAGD. Instead of steam, {{hydrocarbon}} solvents are injected into an upper well to dilute bitumen and enables the diluted bitumen to flow into a lower well. It {{has the advantage}} of much better energy efficiency over <b>steam</b> <b>injection,</b> and it does some partial upgrading of bitumen to oil right in the formation. The process has attracted attention from oil companies, who are experimenting with it.|$|E
25|$|CSS {{has been}} in use by Imperial Oil at Cold Lake since 1985 and is also used by Canadian Natural Resources at Primrose and Wolf Lake and by Shell Canada at Peace River. In this method, the well is put through cycles of <b>steam</b> <b>injection,</b> soak, and oil production. First, steam is {{injected}} into a well at a temperature of 300 to 340 degrees Celsius {{for a period of}} weeks to months; then, the well is allowed to sit for days to weeks to allow heat to soak into the formation; and, later, the hot oil is pumped out of the well for a period of weeks or months. Once the production rate falls off, the well is put through another cycle of injection, soak and production. This process is repeated until the cost of injecting steam becomes higher than the money made from producing oil.|$|E
40|$|Hydrous Pyrolysis / Oxidation (HPO) is an in situ thermal {{remediation}} {{technology that}} uses hot, oxygenated groundwater to completely mineralize {{a wide range}} of organic pollutants. A field demonstration of HPO was performed at a creosote contaminated site during the summer of 1997. The groundwater was heated by <b>steam</b> <b>injections</b> and oxygen was added by coinjection of compressed air. The remediation was monitored from multiple groundwater monitoring wells. Dissolved organic carbon levels increased in response to <b>steam</b> <b>injections</b> {{as a result of the}} enhanced dissolution and mobilization of the creosote into the heated groundwater. Elevated concentrations of partially oxidized organic compounds (i. e. phenols, benzoic acid, fluorenone, anthrone and 9, 10 - anthracenedione), decreased levels of dissolved oxygen and isotopic shifts in the dissolved inorganic pool were indicators of partial to complete oxidative destruction of the creosote in the heated aquifer as a result of the HPO process...|$|R
50|$|Sandwich steaming, {{which was}} {{developed}} in a project among DEIAFA, University of Turin (Italy, www.deiafa.unito.it) and Ferrari Costruzioni Meccaniche (see image), represents a combination of depth and surface steaming, offers an efficient method to induce hot steam into the soil. The steam is simultaneously pushed into the soil from the surface and from the depth. For this purpose, the area, which must be equipped with a deep <b>steaming</b> <b>injection</b> system, {{is covered with a}} steaming hood. The steam enters the soil from the top and the bottom at the same time. Sheets are not suitable, since a high pressure up to 30 mm water column arises underneath the cover.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{analysis}} of process energy requirements has been used to identify in an early design stage the potential process retrofit measures in an integrated pulp and paper mill. The minimum energy requirements (MER) of the process were computed by means of a dual representation that segregates the thermodynamic requirement of the process from its technological implementation. Energy and exergy recovery opportunities have been examined to improve the integration of the utility system to the process. An MILP optimisation targeting method has been applied to identify the best energy conversion options and to optimise the production of combined heat and power (CHP). Replacing the <b>steam</b> <b>injections</b> to mixing tanks by heat exchangers would decrease the MERby 10 %, and increase the combined production of heat and power by a factor 1. 7. Improving the exergy efficiency of the paper drying technology would be more difficult to implement, but the results indicate that this could bring an additional 12 % gain of electricity cogenerated with no change to the MER.

The cyclic steam {{stimulation}} (CSS) [...] "huff-and-puff" [...] method is now widely used in heavy oil production worldwide due to its quick early production rates; however recovery factors are relatively low (10–40% of oil in place) compared to SAGD (60–70% of OIP).|$|E

2500|$|Unconventional oil is oil {{produced}} or extracted using techniques {{other than}} the traditional oil well method from sources such as oil sands, oil shale and the conversion of coal or natural gas to liquid hydrocarbons through processes such as [...] Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Currently, unconventional oil production is less efficient and has a larger environmental impact relative to conventional oil production. Compared to conventional oil, much more energy is required to extract oil from non-conventional sources, so increasing costs and carbon emissions. Technology, such as using <b>steam</b> <b>injection</b> in oil sands deposits, is being developed {{to increase the efficiency}} of unconventional oil production.|$|E
30|$|In steamflooding, {{the steam}} tends {{to move toward}} the upper portion of the {{reservoir}} due to the gravitational effect causing poor drainage in the lower section. This causes the steam to breakthrough to the production well early. The water alternating steam process (WASP) often provides a solution to the problem. However, studies on WASP are found very limited despite the fact that this process is sensitive to the operating conditions. By investigating the WASP using response surface correlation, the factors governing <b>steam</b> <b>injections</b> operations are evaluated. To achieve the maximum net present value (NPV), several operating conditions are investigated. The side effect of gas fuel burning in the steam generation, i.e., CO 2 emission, is considered in selecting the optimum operating condition. As illustrated by reservoir simulation results, if the economy is prioritized and oil price is 45  $/barrel, the optimum case is achieved in which the WASP-start is 3.0  years, the WASP-cycle is 3.5  months, and the steam/water injection rate is 141  m 3 /day. The resulting NPV is 14.1  MM$, and the CO 2 emission is 28.53  ×  103  tonnes.|$|R

40|$|A global steady {{increase}} of energy consumption {{coupled with the}} decline of conventional oil resources points to a more aggressive exploitation of heavy oil. Heavy oil is {{a major source of}} energy in this century with a worldwide base reserve exceeding 2. 5 trillion barrels. Management decisions and production strategies from thermal oil recovery processes are frequently based on reservoir simulation. A proper description of the physical properties, particularly oil viscosity, is essential in performing reliable modeling studies of fluid flow in the reservoir. We simulated cyclic <b>steam</b> <b>injections</b> on the highly viscous Hamaca oil, with a viscosity of over 10, 000 cp at ambient temperature, and the production was drastically impacted by up to an order of magnitude when using improper mixing rules to describe the oil viscosity. This thesis demonstrates the importance of these mixing rules and alerts reservoir engineers to the significance of using different options simulators have built in their platforms to describe the viscosity of heavy oils. Log linear and power mixing rules do not provide enough flexibility to describe the viscosity of extra heavy oil with temperature. A recently implemented mixing rule in a commercial simulator has been studied providing satisfactory results. However, the methodology requires substantial interventions, and cannot be automatically updated. We provide guidelines to improve it and suggest more flexible mixing rules that could easily be implemented in commercial simulators. We also provide a methodology to determine the adequate time for each one of the periods in cyclic <b>steam</b> injection: <b>injection,</b> soaking and production. There is a lot of speculation in this matter and one of the objectives of this thesis is to better understand and provide guidelines to optimize oil production using proper lengths in each one of these periods. We have found that the production and injection periods should be similar in time length. Nevertheless, the production period should not be less than the injection period. On the other hand, the soaking period should be as short as possible because it is unproductive time in terms of field oil production for the well and therefore it translates into a negative cash flow for a company...|$|R

The beam of the engine had a vertical 'plug rod' hung from it, alongside the cylinder. Adjustable blocks or 'tappets' were attached to this rod and as the beam moved up and down, the tappets pressed against long levers or 'horns' attached to the engine's valves, working the cycle of <b>steam</b> and <b>injection</b> water valves to operate the engine.
