25|$|The gelada {{has several}} adaptations for its {{terrestrial}} and graminivorous (grass-eating) lifestyle. It has small, sturdy fingers adapted for pulling grass and narrow, small incisors adapted for chewing it. The gelada {{has a unique}} gait, known as the <b>shuffle</b> <b>gait,</b> that it uses when feeding. It squats bipedally and moves by sliding its feet without changing its posture. Because of this gait, the gelada's rump is hidden beneath and so unavailable for display; its bright red chest patch is visible, though.|$|R
25|$|The {{legs are}} short, and their feet are adapted for {{perching}} rather than walking, {{as the front}} toes are partially joined at the base. Swallows are capable of walking and even running, but they do so with a <b>shuffling,</b> waddling <b>gait.</b> The leg muscles of the river martins (Pseudochelidon) are stronger and more robust than those of other swallows. The river martins have other characteristics that separate them from the other swallows. The structure of the syrinx is substantially different between the two subfamilies; and in most swallows the bill, legs and feet are dark brown or black, but in the river martins the bill is orange-red and the legs and feet are pink.|$|R
25|$|Tremors {{are less}} common in DLB than in Parkinson's disease. Parkinsonian {{features}} may include <b>shuffling</b> <b>gait,</b> reduced arm-swing during walking, blank expression (reduced range of facial expression), stiffness of movements, ratchet-like cogwheeling movements, low speech volume, sialorrhea, and difficulty swallowing. Also, DLB patients often experience problems with orthostatic hypotension, including repeated falls, fainting, and transient loss of consciousness. Sleep-disordered breathing, {{a problem in}} multiple system atrophy, also may be a problem.|$|E
25|$|Task-specific gait {{training}} {{may also}} lead to long-term gait improvement for patients with Parkinson's disease.

50|$|Gluteal gait is an {{abnormal}} gait caused by neurological problems. If the superior gluteal nerve or obturator nerves are injured, {{they fail to}} control the gluteus minimus and medius muscles properly, thus producing an inability to tilt the pelvis upward while swinging the leg forward to walk. To compensate for this loss, the leg swings out laterally so that the foot can move forward, producing a <b>shuffling</b> or waddling <b>gait.</b>|$|R
60|$|Paulvitch {{had taken}} to the jungle when {{he had seen the}} beasts of Tarzan and their savage lord swarm the deck of the Kincaid, and in his terror lest Tarzan pursue and capture him he had {{stumbled}} on deep into the jungle, only to fall at last into the hands of one of the savage cannibal tribes that had felt the weight of Rokoff's evil temper and cruel brutality. Some strange whim of the chief of this tribe saved Paulvitch from death only to plunge him into a life of misery and torture. For ten years he had been the butt of the village, beaten and stoned by the women and children, cut and slashed and disfigured by the warriors; a victim of often recurring fevers of the most malignant variety. Yet he did not die. Smallpox laid its hideous clutches upon him; leaving him unspeakably branded with its repulsive marks. Between it and the attentions of the tribe the countenance of Alexis Paulvitch was so altered that his own mother could not have recognized in the pitiful mask he called his face a single familiar feature. A few scraggly, yellow-white locks had supplanted the thick, dark hair that had covered his head. His limbs were bent and twisted, he walked with a <b>shuffling,</b> unsteady <b>gait,</b> his body doubled forward. His teeth were gone--knocked out by his savage masters. Even his mentality was but a sorry mockery of what it once had been.|$|R
2500|$|Many breeds {{of horses}} inherit {{the ability to}} perform these gaits, which may be {{observable}} naturally from birth or may present with a minimal amount of training. Some horses without apparent inborn gaited ability can be taught to [...] "gait" [...] or amble. [...] However, training usually is not successful unless there is some inherited genetic ability in the horse. [...] Ambling gaits can be taught by slightly restraining the horse at a trot or pace. [...] The length of the stride is kept long, but the rider asks the horse to alter its balance {{to break up the}} two strides in such a manner to produce a four-beat gait. [...] Sometimes, this effect is accidentally produced in an attempt to create the slow two-beat jog trot desired in western pleasure competition when the horse cannot sustain a slow jog and falls into a <b>shuffling,</b> four beat <b>gait</b> described as [...] "trotting in front and walking behind," [...] which is penalized in the show ring.|$|R

60|$|At {{the bottom}} of the steep descent from the city gate we came to the tomb of the Virgin; and by special {{agreement}} made with Joseph we left our horses here for a few moments, in order that we might descend into the subterranean chapel under the tomb, in which mass was at this moment being said. There is something awful in that chapel, when, as at the present moment, it is crowded with Eastern worshippers from the very altar {{up to the top of}} the dark steps by which the descent is made. It must be remembered that Eastern worshippers are not like the churchgoers of London, or even of Rome or Cologne. They are wild men of various nations and races,-- Maronites from Lebanon Roumelians, Candiotes, Copts from Upper Egypt, Russians from the Crimea, Armenians and Abyssinians. They savour strongly of Oriental life and of Oriental dirt. They are clad in skins or hairy cloaks with huge hoods. Their heads are shaved, and their faces covered with short, grisly, fierce beards. They are silent mostly, looking out of their eyes ferociously, as though murder were in their thoughts, and rapine. But they never slouch, or cringe in their bodies, or <b>shuffle</b> in their <b>gait.</b> Dirty, fierce-looking, uncouth, repellent as they are, there is always about them a something of personal dignity which is not compatible with an Englishman's ordinary hat and pantaloons.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Kinesiology (Exercise Science)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. Introduction Parkinson???s Disease (PD) is {{the second}} most common {{neurological}} disease following Alzheimer???s Disease. It is progressive in nature involving neurodegeneration and neuronal death primarily in the basal ganglia. Among the many sequella of the disease, one of the most debilitating is the development of an Parkinsonian gait: hunched posture, muscular tremors, <b>shuffling,</b> increased <b>gait</b> velocity and a decrease or lack of arm swing. Current management of the disease involves the use of pharmaceuticals mimicking the neurotransmitter dopamine. Management of the disease may also come from other sources alongside pharmaceuticals in the form of exercise. Recent research on the effects of high intensity exercise training on the brain in both the normal aging population (Colcombe et al, 2003; Colcombe et al, 2006) and in Parkinson???s patients (Fisher et al, 2008; Hirsch et al, 2003; Ridgel et al, 2009) have found that high intensity exercise increases brain plasticity, blood flow and brain volume. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether intense exercise, at a predetermined target heart rate, on a stationary bicycle improves rhythmic gait immediately post activity in persons with early staged Parkinson???s Disease. It was predicted that exercise will improve gait rhythmicity as evidenced by consistent stride length, gait velocity and increased toe clearance during the testing period. Methodology Testing protocol was approved by the Sacramento State University (CSUS) IRB department and the Kinesiology Graduate department. Three mild to moderate idiopathic Parkinson???s diagnosed adults were recruited and cleared via a local primary care physician. Prior to participation subjects completed a Health History Questionnaire and a Mini-Mental Examination. Functional mobility was tested with a Timed Up and Go test. Gait Analysis was tested in the Biomechanics Laboratory at CSUS. Protocol involved riding a stationary Monarch bicycle with a 5 min warm-up, an exercise set of 20 minutes, and a 2 minute cool down. The heart rate reserve method was used to measure target heart rate was calculated based on prior stress test for clearance. Immediate post exercise, gait was once again tested motion capture cameras in the laboratory. A repeated measures test (dependent t-tests) was used to help determine the effect of intense exercise on comparing toe clearance, stride length, gait speed during level walking. Mean and standard deviation between pre and post trials are listed. Results Subjects were classified in stage 2. 3 of the Hoehn and Yahr scale. Average years of diagnoses at 6. 33 ?? 1. 6 years. All subjects reached target heart rate percent of 60 - 80...|$|R

6000|$|Disappeared, Sir, as if {{the earth}} had {{swallowed}} him up! A second ago I had seen him dimly, yet distinctly through the veil of snow and rain ahead of me, running with that unmistakable <b>shuffling</b> <b>gait</b> of his, hugging the dog closely under his arm. I had seen him--another effort and I might have touched him!--now the long and deserted street lay dark and mysterious before me, and behind me I could hear the measured tramp of the gendarmes and their peremptory call of [...] "Halt, {{in the name of}} the King!" ...|$|E
60|$|Slowly and carefully, therefore, I gained my feet, only to {{see that}} my watcher did the same; {{cautiously}} I advanced toward him, finding that by moving with a <b>shuffling</b> <b>gait</b> I could retain my balance as well as make reasonably rapid progress. As I neared the brute he backed cautiously away from me, and when I had reached the open he moved to one side to let me pass. He then fell in behind me and followed about ten paces in my rear as I made my way along the deserted street.|$|E
60|$|About {{five minutes}} later, Desgas returned, {{followed}} by an elderly Jew, in a dirty, threadbare gaberdine, worn greasy across the shoulders. His red hair, which he wore after the fashion of the Polish Jews, with the corkscrew curls each side of his face, was plentifully sprinkled with grey--a general coating of grime, about his cheeks and his chin, gave him a peculiarly dirty and loathsome appearance. He had the habitual stoop, those of his race affected in mock humility in past centuries, before the dawn of equality and freedom in matters of faith, and he walked behind Desgas with the peculiar <b>shuffling</b> <b>gait</b> which has remained the characteristic of the Jew trader in continental Europe to this day.|$|E
6000|$|The morning walk of Monsieur Mutuel {{was in the}} {{brightest}} patch that the sun made in the Grande Place of a dull old fortified French town. The manner of his morning walk was with his hands crossed behind him; an umbrella, in figure the express image of himself, always in one hand; a snuffbox in the other. Thus, with the <b>shuffling</b> <b>gait</b> of the Elephant (who really does deal with the very worst trousers-maker employed by the Zoological world, and who appeared to have recommended him to Monsieur Mutuel), the old gentleman sunned himself daily when sun was to be had--of course, {{at the same time}} sunning a red ribbon at his button-hole; for was he not an ancient Frenchman? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had my {{passage on}} a little sea-going steamer. Her captain was a Swede, and knowing me for a seaman, invited me on the bridge. He was a young man, lean, fair, and morose, with lanky hair and a <b>shuffling</b> <b>gait.</b> As we left the miserable little wharf, he tossed his head contemptuously at the shore. 'Been living there?' he asked. I said, 'Yes.' 'Fine lot these {{government}} chaps--are they not?' he went on, speaking English with great precision and considerable bitterness. 'It is funny what some people will do for a few francs a month. I wonder what becomes of that kind when it goes up country?' I said to him I expected to see that soon. 'So-o-o!' he exclaimed. He shuffled athwart, keeping one eye ahead vigilantly. 'Don't be too sure,' he continued. 'The other day I took up a man who hanged himself on the road. He was a Swede, too.' 'Hanged himself! Why, in God's name?' I cried. He kept on looking out watchfully. 'Who knows? The sun too much for him, or the country perhaps.' ...|$|E
60|$|Mervyn {{did bring}} home some {{shooting}} friends, {{but he made}} no difficulties as to the seclusion that Miss Charlecote had recommended for his sister; accepting it so easily that Phoebe thought he must have intended it from the first. From that time he was seldom at home without one or more guests--an arrangement that kept the young ladies chiefly to the west wing, and always, when in the garden, forced them {{to be on their}} guard against stumbling upon smoking gentlemen. It was a late-houred, noisy company, and the sounds that reached the sisters made the younger girls curious, and the governess anxious. Perhaps it was impossible that girls of seventeen and fifteen should not be excited by the vicinity of moustaches and beards whom they were bidden to avoid; and even the alternate French and German which Miss Fennimore enforced on Bertha more strongly than ever, merely produced the variety of her descanting on their knebelbarten, or on l'heure a guelle les voix de ces messieurs-la entonnaient sur le grand escalier, till Miss Fennimore declared that she would have Latin and Greek talked if there were no word for a gentleman in either! There were always stories to be told of Bertha's narrow escapes of being overtaken by them in garden or corridor, till Maria, infected by the panic, used to flounder away as if from a beast of prey, and being as tall as, and considerably stouter than, Phoebe, with the <b>shuffling</b> <b>gait</b> of the imbecile, would produce a volume of sound that her sister always feared might attract notice, and irritate Mervyn.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Trevelyan made {{no reply}} to this, but walked on in silence, with his {{minister}} at his elbow. He was very wretched, understanding well the degradation {{to which he}} was subjecting himself in discussing his wife's conduct with this man;--but with whom else could he discuss it? The man seemed to be meaner now than he had been before he had been seen in his own home. And Trevelyan was conscious too that he himself was not in outward appearance as he used to be; that he was ill-dressed, and haggard, and worn, and visibly a wretched being. How can any man care to dress himself with attention who is always alone, and always miserable when alone? During the months which had passed over him since he had sent his wife away from him, his very nature had been altered, and he himself was aware of the change. As he went about, his eyes were ever cast downwards, and he walked with a quick <b>shuffling</b> <b>gait,</b> and he suspected others, feeling that he himself was suspected. And all work had ceased with him. Since she had left him he had not read a single book that was worth the reading. And he knew it all. He was conscious that he was becoming disgraced and degraded. He would sooner have shot himself than have walked into his club, or even have allowed himself to be seen by daylight in Pall Mall, or Piccadilly. He had taken in his misery to drinking little drops of brandy in the morning, although he knew well that there was no shorter road to the devil than that opened by such a habit. He looked up for a moment at Bozzle, and then asked him a question. [...] "Where is he now?" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{here the}} shop-bell rang; {{it was like}} a sound from a remote distance,--so far had Hepzibah descended into the sepulchral depths of her reminiscences. On {{entering}} the shop, she found an old man there, a humble resident of Pyncheon Street, and whom, for a great many years past, she had suffered {{to be a kind of}} familiar of the house. He was an immemorial personage, who seemed always to have had a white head and wrinkles, and never to have possessed but a single tooth, and that a half-decayed one, in the front of the upper jaw. Well advanced as Hepzibah was, she could not remember when Uncle Venner, as the neighborhood called him, had not gone up and down the street, stooping a little and drawing his feet heavily over the gravel or pavement. But still there was something tough and vigorous about him, that not only kept him in daily breath, but enabled him to fill a place which would else have been vacant in the apparently crowded world. To go of errands with his slow and <b>shuffling</b> <b>gait,</b> which made you doubt how he ever was to arrive anywhere; to saw a small household's foot or two of firewood, or knock to pieces an old barrel, or split up a pine board for kindling-stuff; in summer, to dig the few yards of garden ground appertaining to a low-rented tenement, and share the produce of his labor at the halves; in winter, to shovel away the snow from the sidewalk, or open paths to the woodshed, or along the clothes-line; such were some of the essential offices which Uncle Venner performed among at least a score of families. Within that circle, he claimed the same sort of privilege, and probably felt as much warmth of interest, as a clergyman does in the range of his parishioners. Not that he laid claim to the tithe pig; but, as an analogous mode of reverence, he went his rounds, every morning, to gather up the crumbs of the table and overflowings of the dinner-pot, as food for a pig of his own.|$|E
60|$|The old {{man looked}} as if the remote high gallery windows, with their little strip of sky, might have been the point of his better fortunes, from which he had descended, until he had {{gradually}} sunk down below there to the bottom. He had been in that place six nights a week for many years, but had never been observed to raise his eyes above his music-book, and was confidently believed to have never seen a play. There were legends in the place that he did not so much as know the popular heroes and heroines by sight, and that the low comedian had 'mugged' at him in his richest manner fifty nights for a wager, and he had shown no trace of consciousness. The carpenters had a joke to the effect that he was dead without being aware of it; and the frequenters of the pit supposed him to pass his whole life, night and day, and Sunday and all, in the orchestra. They had tried him a few times with pinches of snuff offered over the rails, and he had always responded to this attention with a momentary waking up of manner that had the pale phantom of a gentleman in it: beyond this he never, on any occasion, had any other part in what was going on than the part written out for the clarionet; in private life, where there was no part for the clarionet, he had no part at all. Some said he was poor, some said he was a wealthy miser; but he said nothing, never lifted up his bowed head, never varied his <b>shuffling</b> <b>gait</b> by getting his springless foot from the ground. Though expecting now to be summoned by his niece, he did not hear her until she had spoken to him three or four times; nor was he at all surprised by the presence of two nieces instead of one, but merely said in his tremulous voice, 'I am coming, I am coming!' and crept forth by some underground way which emitted a cellarous smell.|$|E

Although Parkinson's disease is {{primarily}} a disease of the nigrostriatal pathway and not the extrapyramidal system, loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra leads to dysregulation of the extrapyramidal system.
