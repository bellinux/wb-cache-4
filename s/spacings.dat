5|$|In statistics, maximum spacing {{estimation}} (MSE or MSP), or maximum {{product of}} spacing estimation (MPS), {{is a method}} for estimating the parameters of a univariate statistical model. The method requires maximization of the geometric mean of <b>spacings</b> in the data, which are {{the differences between the}} values of the cumulative distribution function at neighbouring data points.|$|E
5|$|This classically {{designed}} wing {{has been}} attributed to Inigo Jones, but without supporting evidence; as with a similar attribution at Brympton d'Evercy, also in Somerset, it seems to be based solely on the alternating segmental and pointed pediments over the groundfloor windows, and ignoring the irregularities in their <b>spacings</b> and placings, which Jones is unlikely to have countenanced.|$|E
5|$|The MSE {{method is}} also {{sensitive}} to secondary clustering. One {{example of this}} phenomenon is when a set of observations is thought {{to come from a}} single normal distribution, but in fact comes from a mixture normals with different means. A second example is when the data is thought to come from an exponential distribution, but actually comes from a gamma distribution. In the latter case, smaller <b>spacings</b> may occur in the lower tail. A high value of M(θ) would indicate this secondary clustering effect, and suggesting {{a closer look at the}} data is required.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} {{crystals}} {{could be used}} as a diffraction grating for X-rays arose in 1912 in a conversation between Paul Peter Ewald and Max von Laue in the English Garden in Munich. Ewald had proposed a resonator model of crystals for his thesis, but this model could not be validated using visible light, since the wavelength was much larger than the spacing between the resonators. Von Laue realized that electromagnetic radiation of a shorter wavelength was needed to observe such small <b>spacings,</b> and suggested that X-rays might have a wavelength comparable to the unit-cell spacing in crystals. Von Laue worked with two technicians, Walter Friedrich and his assistant Paul Knipping, to shine a beam of X-rays through a copper sulfate crystal and record its diffraction on a photographic plate. After being developed, the plate showed a large number of well-defined spots arranged in a pattern of intersecting circles around the spot produced by the central beam. Von Laue developed a law that connects the scattering angles and the size and orientation of the unit-cell <b>spacings</b> in the crystal, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1914.|$|E
5|$|There {{are certain}} distributions, {{especially}} those with three or more parameters, whose likelihoods may become infinite along certain paths in the parameter space. Using maximum likelihood to estimate these parameters often breaks down, with one parameter tending to the specific value that causes the likelihood to be infinite, rendering the other parameters inconsistent. The method of maximum <b>spacings,</b> however, being dependent on the difference between points on the cumulative distribution function and not individual likelihood points, does not have this issue, and will return valid results over a much wider array of distributions.|$|E
5|$|In fish {{such as the}} herring which live in {{shallower}} water, {{the mirrors}} must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks {{with a range of}} different <b>spacings.</b> A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors, all oriented vertically. Silvering is found in other marine animals as well as fish. The cephalopods, including squid, octopus and cuttlefish, have multi-layer mirrors made of protein rather than guanine.|$|E
5|$|X-rays {{are used}} to produce the {{diffraction}} pattern because their wavelength λ is typically the same order of magnitude (1–100 angstroms) as the spacing d between planes in the crystal. In principle, any wave impinging on a regular array of scatterers produces diffraction, as predicted first by Francesco Maria Grimaldi in 1665. To produce significant diffraction, the spacing between the scatterers and the wavelength of the impinging wave should be similar in size. For illustration, the diffraction of sunlight through a bird's feather was first reported by James Gregory in the later 17th century. The first artificial diffraction gratings for visible light were constructed by David Rittenhouse in 1787, and Joseph von Fraunhofer in 1821. However, visible light has too long a wavelength (typically, 5500 angstroms) to observe diffraction from crystals. Prior to the first X-ray diffraction experiments, the <b>spacings</b> between lattice planes in a crystal were not known with certainty.|$|E
25|$|While {{it is easy}} {{to predict}} the number of lines a radical's EPR {{spectrum}} should show, the reverse problem, unraveling a complex multi-line EPR spectrum and assigning the various <b>spacings</b> to specific nuclei, is more difficult.|$|E
25|$|To plot other points, whose angles are {{not such}} round numbers as 60° and 50°, one must {{visually}} interpolate between the nearest grid lines. It {{is helpful to}} have a net with finer spacing than 10°. <b>Spacings</b> of 2° are common.|$|E
25|$|The figure {{shows the}} light diffracted by 2-element and 5-element {{gratings}} where the grating <b>spacings</b> are the same; {{it can be}} seen that the maxima are in the same position, but the detailed structures of the intensities are different.|$|E
25|$|Crystal {{structures}} of crystalline material are typically determined from X-ray or neutron single-crystal diffraction data {{and stored in}} crystal structure databases. They are routinely identified by comparing reflection intensities and lattice <b>spacings</b> from X-ray powder diffraction data with entries in powder-diffraction fingerprinting databases.|$|E
25|$|All Morse code {{elements}} {{depend on the}} dot length. A dash is the length of 3 dots, and <b>spacings</b> are specified in number of dot lengths. An unambiguous method of specifying the transmission speed is to specify the dot duration as, for example, 50milliseconds.|$|E
25|$|In 1889, John Alexander MacWilliam {{reported}} in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) of his experiments in which application of an electrical impulse to the human heart in asystole caused a ventricular contraction and that a heart rhythm of 60–70 beats per minute could be evoked by impulses applied at <b>spacings</b> equal to 60–70/minute.|$|E
25|$|A Hahn echo decay {{experiment}} {{can be used}} {{to measure}} the dephasing time, as shown in the animation below. The size of the echo is recorded for different <b>spacings</b> of the two pulses. This reveals the decoherence which is not refocused by the 180° pulse. In simple cases, an exponential decay is measured which is described by the T2 time.|$|E
25|$|In the {{shallower}} epipelagic waters, {{the mirrors}} must reflect {{a mixture of}} wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks {{with a range of}} different <b>spacings.</b> A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally.

25|$|The {{uniformity}} of the measured sound field for this whistle confirmed its monopole-like nature. Measurements of speed {{dependence of the}} sound level showed it to be very close to U4, further confirming the monopole nature of the source. At these speeds and <b>spacings,</b> the feedback was normally Class II, but reflecting surfaces {{as far away as}} three meters and with proper phasing, controlled the tone, converting the feedback to Class III.|$|E
25|$|A barcode is {{an optical}} {{machine-readable}} representation of data, which shows certain data on certain products. Originally, barcodes represented {{data in the}} widths (lines) and the <b>spacings</b> of parallel lines, and may {{be referred to as}} linear or one-dimensional barcodes or symbologies. They also come in patterns of squares, dots, hexagons and other geometric patterns within images termed two-dimensional matrix codes or symbologies. Norman Joseph Woodland is best known for inventing the barcode for which he received a patent in October 1952.|$|E
25|$|Many radio {{applications}} require frequencies {{that are}} higher than can be directly input to the digital counter. To overcome this, the entire counter could be constructed using high-speed logic such as ECL, or more commonly, using a fast initial division stage called a prescaler which reduces the frequency to a manageable level. Since the prescaler {{is part of the}} overall division ratio, a fixed prescaler can cause problems designing a system with narrow channel <b>spacings</b> – typically encountered in radio applications. This can be overcome using a dual-modulus prescaler.|$|E
25|$|A barcode is an optical, machine-readable, {{representation}} of data; the data usually describes {{something about the}} object that carries the barcode. Originally barcodes systematically represented data by varying the widths and <b>spacings</b> of parallel lines, and may {{be referred to as}} linear or one-dimensional (1D). Later two-dimensional (2D) codes were developed, using rectangles, dots, hexagons and other geometric patterns in two dimensions, usually called barcodes although they do not use bars as such. Barcodes were initially scanned by special optical scanners called barcode readers. Later application software became available for devices that could read images, such as smartphones with cameras.|$|E
25|$|In Copenhagen, Heisenberg and Hans Kramers {{collaborated on}} a paper on dispersion, or the {{scattering}} from atoms of radiation whose wavelength {{is larger than the}} atoms. They showed that the successful formula Kramers had developed earlier could not be based on Bohr orbits, because the transition frequencies are based on level <b>spacings</b> which are not constant. The frequencies which occur in the Fourier transform of sharp classical orbits, by contrast, are equally spaced. But these results could be explained by a semi-classical Virtual State model: the incoming radiation excites the valence, or outer, electron to a virtual state from which it decays. In a subsequent paper Heisenberg showed that this virtual oscillator model could also explain the polarization of fluorescent radiation.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} metals in their solid state {{helps to explain}} the unusually high {{electrical}} conductivity of copper. In a copper atom, the outermost 4s energy zone, or conduction band, is only half filled, so many electrons are able to carry electric current. When an electric field is applied to a copper wire, the conduction of electrons accelerates towards the electropositive end, thereby creating a current. These electrons encounter resistance to their passage by colliding with impurity atoms, vacancies, lattice ions, and imperfections. The average distance travelled between collisions, defined as the “mean free path,” is inversely proportional to the resistivity of the metal. What is unique about copper is its long mean free path (approximately 100 atomic <b>spacings</b> at room temperature). This mean free path increases rapidly as copper is chilled.|$|E
25|$|Film {{capacitors}} for use {{in electronic}} equipment are packaged in the common and usual industry styles: axial, radial, and SMD. Traditional axial type packages are less used today, but are still specified for point-to-point wiring and some traditional through-hole printed circuit boards. The most common form factor is the radial type (single ended), with both terminals {{on one side of}} the capacitor body. To facilitate automated insertion, radial plastic film capacitors are commonly constructed with terminal <b>spacings</b> at standardized distances, starting with 2.5mm pitch and increasing in 2.5mm steps. Radial capacitors are available potted in plastic cases, or dipped in an epoxy resin to protect the capacitor body against environmental influences. Although the transient heat of reflow soldering induces high stress in the plastic film materials, film capacitors able to withstand such temperatures are available in Surface Mounted Device“ (SMD) packages.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{of other}} {{experiments}} {{not based on}} the Michelson–Morley principle, i.e. non-optical isotropy tests achieving an even higher level of precision, are Clock comparison or Hughes–Drever experiments. In Drever's 1961 experiment, 7Li nuclei in the ground state, which has total angular momentum J=3/2, were split into four equally spaced levels by a magnetic field. Each transition between a pair of adjacent levels should emit a photon of equal frequency, resulting in a single, sharp spectral line. However, since the nuclear wave functions for different MJ have different orientations in space relative to the magnetic field, any orientation dependence, whether from an aether wind or from a dependence on the large-scale distribution of mass in space (see Mach's principle), would perturb the energy <b>spacings</b> between the four levels, resulting in an anomalous broadening or splitting of the line. No such broadening was observed. Modern repeats {{of this kind of}} experiment have provided some of the most accurate confirmations of the principle of Lorentz invariance.|$|E
25|$|Most {{practical}} calculations {{performed with}} transverse lattice gauge theory have utilized one further ingredient: the color-dielectric expansion. A dielectric formulation {{is one in}} which the gauge group elements, whose generators are the gluon fields in the case of QCD, are replaced by collective (smeared, blocked, etc.) variables which represent an average over their fluctuations on short distance scales. These dielectric variables are massive, carry color, and form an effective gauge field theory with classical action minimized at zero field, meaning that color flux is expelled from the vacuum at the classical level. This maintains the triviality of the light-front vacuum structure, but arises only for a low momentum cutoff on the effective theory (corresponding to transverse lattice <b>spacings</b> of order 1/2 fm in QCD). As a result, the effective cutoff Hamiltonian is initially poorly constrained. The color-dielectric expansion, together with requirements of Lorentz symmetry restoration, has nevertheless been successfully used to organize the interactions in the Hamiltonian in a way suitable for practical solution. The most accurate spectrum of large- glueballs has been obtained in this way, and as well as pion light-front wave functions in agreement with a range of experimental data.|$|E
25|$|Stripe-patterned polymer films can {{be formed}} on solid {{substrates}} by casting diluted polymer solution. This method is relatively easy, inexpensive, {{and has no}} restriction on the scaffold materials that can be used. The procedure involves horizontally overlapping glass plates while keeping them vertically separated by a narrow gap filled with a polymer solution. The upper plate is moved at a constant velocity between 60 and 100µm/s. A thin liquid film of solution is continuously formed {{at the edge of}} the sliding glass following evaporation of the solvent. Stripe patterns prepared at speeds of 60, 70, and 100µm/s created width and groove <b>spacings</b> of 2.2 and 6.1µm, 3.6 and 8.4µm, and 4.3 and 12.7µm, respectively; the range of heights for the ridges was 50–100nm. Tsuruma, Tanaka et al. demonstrated that embryonic neural cells cultured on film coated with poly-L-lysine attached and elongated parallel to poly(ε-caprolactone)/chloroform solution (1g/L) stripes with narrow pattern width and spacing (width: 2.2µm, spacing: 6.1µm). However, the neurons grew across the axis of the patterns with wide width and spacing (width: 4.3µm, spacing: 12.7µm). On average, the neurons on the stripe-patterned films had less neurites per cell and longer neurites compared to the neurons on non-patterned films. Thus, the stripe pattern parameters are able to determine the growth direction, the length of neurites, and the number of neurites per cell.|$|E

500|$|The MSE {{method was}} derived {{independently}} by Russel Cheng and Nik Amin at the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology, and Bo Ranneby at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.
