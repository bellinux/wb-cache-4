40|$|Unseating of bridge spans due to {{excessive}} relative hinge opening {{is a common}} problem for bridges subjected to strong ground motion. Various unseating <b>prevention</b> <b>devices</b> have been developed in both the United States and Japan to try to {{reduce the likelihood of}} collapse due to unseating. This paper presents the results of the evaluation of unseating <b>prevention</b> <b>devices</b> using nitinol shape memory alloys (SMAs). Superelastic SMAs have the ability to remain elastic under very large deformations, due to a solid-state martensitic transformation. This unique property leads to enhanced performance of the adaptive superelastic unseating <b>prevention</b> <b>device,</b> compared with conventional devices used in the United States and Japan. To assess the effectiveness of the devices, nonlinear time history analyses are performed on a typical multiple frame reinforced concrete box girder bridge using a suite of representative ground motions. The results show that for multiple frame reinforced concrete box girder bridges the adaptive superelastic devices are very effective in limiting the relative hinge displacement and preventing unseating, compared with the conventional steel cable restrainers. 1...|$|R

50|$|Although no {{reliable}} statistics {{are available on}} the use of chastity belts, anecdotal reports from manufacturers suggest that most belts sold in Europe and the U.S. are for men, and that of the female belts ordered, relatively few are used as rape <b>prevention</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{backwater}} valve is a backflow <b>prevention</b> <b>device</b> {{used to prevent}} outbound water through a dwelling's drain pipes from re-entering -- [...] "back flowing"—into a home. The valve contains a flap that allows water to exit the home, but closes to prevent the back flow into the home.|$|R
50|$|He {{started as}} a chemist at RRIM in 1949 and led research, {{particularly}} in physiochemical changes in natural rubber. He turned the institute into a research centre able to conduct in-depth research into the manufacture of nearly every conceivable rubber application from tubes, tyres and gloves to earthquake disaster <b>prevention</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
50|$|Whenever a {{flexible}} hose {{is connected to}} a drinkable water supply, the spigot or tap should be fitted with an approved backflow <b>prevention</b> <b>device,</b> to prevent contaminated water from being siphoned back, {{in the event of}} a pressure drop. Many water suppliers require this, and plumbing code may legally require permanently installed backflow preventers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{additional}} {{expense of}} leak <b>prevention</b> <b>devices</b> (LPDs) or check valves are recommended to be fitted at each watering distribution point along {{the system to}} insure even distribution of water. If the lines are allowed to drain between pulses most of the water will preferentially flow to those {{at the beginning of}} the line.|$|R
50|$|Health network {{surveillance}} is {{a practice of}} health information management involving a combination of security, privacy and regulatory compliance with patient health information (PHI). Health {{network surveillance}} addresses the rapidly increasing trend of electronic health records (EHR) and its incompatibility with information security practices that ‘lock down’ access through methods such as: modern firewalls, intrusion detection and <b>prevention</b> <b>devices,</b> and anti-virus and end-point protections.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{potential}} risk of contamination in the potable (drinking) water supply, a backflow <b>prevention</b> <b>device</b> is required for most fertigation systems. Backflow requirements may vary greatly. Therefore, {{it is very important}} to understand the proper level of backflow prevention required by law. In the United States, the minimum backflow protection is usually determined by state regulation. Each city or town may set the level of protection required.|$|R
50|$|Backflow {{is a term}} in {{plumbing}} for {{an unwanted}} flow {{of water in the}} reverse direction. It can be a serious health risk for the contamination of potable water supplies with foul water. In the most obvious case, a toilet flush cistern and its water supply must be isolated from the toilet bowl. For this reason, building codes mandate a series of measures and backflow <b>prevention</b> <b>devices</b> to prevent backflow.|$|R

50|$|Dogs can {{be fitted}} with {{microchip}} implants {{that make them}} identifiable if they are found. This enables a dog to be identified unless the chip has been removed or has degraded, been assimilated or otherwise been deactivated. Similar methods such as DNA sampling or ear-tattooing are used to identify individual animals and to deter dognappers. Other <b>prevention</b> <b>devices</b> include flashing lights on the dog's collar and strong leashes locked to the collar.|$|R
50|$|Multiple {{check valves}} can be {{connected}} in series. For example, a {{double check valve}} is often used as a backflow <b>prevention</b> <b>device</b> to keep potentially contaminated water from siphoning back into municipal water supply lines. There are also double ball check valves {{in which there are}} two ball/seat combinations sequentially in the same body to ensure positive leak-tight shutoff when blocking reverse flow; and piston check valves, wafer check valves, and ball-and-cone check valves.|$|R

50|$|In 1914 an {{innovative}} collision <b>prevention</b> <b>device</b> was successfully tested on the South Manchester Railroad after president Mollen had offered a prize to {{the inventor of}} a device that would automatically stop trains who approached {{each other on the}} same track. The rail track was wired, and a system of batteries was attached to the locomotive, which threw over the throttle, applied the air brakes and thus stopped the train, when the axles of another train produced an electrical short cut between the rails.|$|R
50|$|A {{pressure}} {{vacuum breaker}} (PVB) {{is a type}} of backflow <b>prevention</b> <b>device,</b> used to keep non-potable (or contaminated) water from entering the water supply. A PVB is similar to an atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB), except that the PVB contains a spring-loaded poppet. This makes it acceptable for applications that are high hazard or where valves are downstream. Pressure vacuum breakers must be protected from freezing when installed outdoors. PVBs usually have test cocks, to which specially-calibrated gauges are attached, {{in order to ensure that}} they are functioning properly.|$|R

40|$|The {{implementation}} of preventive devices {{is always a}} difficult task to anticipate. It is also difficult to verify the adequacy of resources used to the needs. For this purpose, the Belgian Red Cross created the computer tool collecting administrative information, diagnostic codes, destination of the patient, triage, level of emergency as well as kinetics of admission to the preventive care station. Data analysis in {{the various types of}} events confirms the usefulness of <b>prevention</b> <b>devices.</b> Although it can be improved, the tool is reliable and permits a great extent the adaptative means to the needs.

50|$|Inadequate {{passenger}} restraints: An {{occupant of}} a vehicle is at increased risk of injury if the restraint system, including active restraints such as seat belts and passive restraints such as airbags, fail to keep the occupant {{in his or her}} seat, or fail to prevent the passenger from being ejected from the vehicle. Such a failure may cause or contribute to serious injury and death in what might otherwise have been an accident with minor injuries or without injury. Beside seat belts, the most important injury <b>prevention</b> <b>devices</b> in the car are front and side impact airbags.|$|R
40|$|Background Multiple {{methods are}} {{utilized}} for thermoregulation of combat wounded as they proceed {{from the point}} of injury until their arrival in the United States. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop an in vitro torso model constructed with fluid bags and to determine whether this model could be used to differentiate between the heat <b>prevention</b> performance of <b>devices</b> with active chemical or radiant forced-air heating systems compared with passive heat loss <b>prevention</b> <b>devices.</b> Methods We tested two groups of hypothermia prevention products: Group 1, which consisted of three devices with actively heated systems (either chemically or electrically); and Group 2, which consisted of five methods of passive heat loss prevention.

30|$|The maximum BHT was {{acquired}} from the DOSECC temperature tool. This tool {{lies in the}} core barrel, and thus does not log continuously. However, {{it was necessary to}} use this tool throughout the drilling operation because the Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) requires a blowout <b>prevention</b> <b>device</b> if the temperature exceeds 100  °C (Delahunty et al. 2012). The maximum temperature recorded was 59.3  °C at 1824  m, which was the greatest depth at which DOSECC measured the temperature. Because the DOSECC tool was never in true equilibrium with the ambient conditions, the maximum BHT measurement must be lower than the true equilibrium temperature at that depth.|$|R
5000|$|Henry Doulton {{invented the}} modern form of ceramic candle {{sanitary}} water filter in 1827. In 1835, Queen Victoria commissioned him to produce such a device for her personal use. By 1846, Doulton ceramics was {{widely recognized as}} a premier manufacturer of an effective <b>prevention</b> <b>device</b> for treating infective water. In 1887, Doulton was knighted, in part for his work with water filters. Louis Pasteur's research concerning bacteria also had provided a demonstrable reason for the filters' effect. Doulton's original organization for water filters remains in existence, {{although it has been}} sold and renamed several times.

Legislative priorities are determined with current emphasis on the College Fire Prevention Act which authorizes federal funding to upgrade fire safety in college dormitories and fraternity/sorority housing. It is estimated that there is $3.7 billion worth of fraternity housing, most of which is currently not fitted with fire <b>prevention</b> <b>devices</b> such as sprinklers. Other legislative priorities include Freedom of Association, Freedom of Speech, student privacy, and single sex exemptions under Title IX.|$|R
