5|$|While older freeways {{have some}} lapses in <b>safety</b> <b>features,</b> {{contemporary}} 400-series highways have design speeds of , speed limits of , various collision avoidance and traffic management systems, and several design standards adopted throughout North America.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the Chinese authorities found that the plant had been lacking any major <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> and was severely below regulation benchmarks, with the direct cause of the accident being attributed to inappropriate use of substandard equipment. The investigation also concluded that the various other safety failings at the facility were contributing factors. The report went on to criticize safety standards all throughout the Chinese steel industry.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Kalam was criticised {{by civil}} groups over his {{stand on the}} Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant; he {{supported}} {{the establishment of the}} nuclear power plant and was accused of not speaking with the local people. The protesters were hostile to his visit as they saw him as a pro-nuclear scientist and were unimpressed by the assurances he provided regarding the <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> of the plant.|$|E
5|$|The PL.8 also {{incorporated}} several <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> {{in case of}} ditching at sea. Apart {{from small}} floats attached directly to the undersides of the lower wing, the main units of the fixed, tailskid undercarriage could be jettisoned on takeoff, {{in order to reduce}} the aircraft's weight. The underside of the fuselage was given a boat-like shape and made watertight for a water landing. Nungesser and Coli's plan was to make a water landing in New York, in front of the Statue of Liberty.|$|E
5|$|Introduced a Mark Levinson premium sound system. In {{its highest}} trim specification, the LS 430 {{included}} Lexus Link telematics, power door and trunk closers, heated and cooled front seats, and power reclining massage rear seats equipped with audio controls, power sunshade, a cooler, and air purifier. Several rear seat features adopted for the LS 430 {{had been previously}} available in Japanese market luxury vehicles. <b>Safety</b> <b>features</b> added to the LS 430 included front and rear side curtain airbags, park sensors, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and electronic brakeforce distribution. The vehicle also gained water repellent windshield and side glass.|$|E

5|$|The {{coaches are}} {{primarily}} hauled by MPI MPXpress series locomotives. The current model, the 4000-horsepower MP40PH-3C, {{is more powerful}} that their predecessors, the EMD F59PH. They are capable of pulling or pushing trains of 12 coaches instead of 10. More than 60 of these locomotives have been ordered since their introduction in 2006, with a further 16 types of an even more powerful model, the MP54AC, to enter service in coming years. Opposite the locomotive, trains are bookended by cab cars, which are coaches with driver controls incorporated into them. While most of them closely resemble ordinary coaches, GO Transit began upgrading their rail fleet with newly designed, more crashworthy cab cars {{in the summer of}} 2015, incorporating an improved visibility, <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> and comfort for train crews.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} LS with {{continuous}} controlled Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). The addition of an automated parallel parking assist feature, {{the first of its}} kind in the U.S., allowed the LS 460 to steer itself into preselected parking spaces. Other drive-assist features included a brake-hold system, radar cruise control, electric variable gear ratio power steering, and electronically controlled braking. The new stability control system was improved to anticipate skids and alter steering assist and gear ratios. The suite of new <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> extended from an eye-tracking Driver Monitoring System to a lane departure warning system. The pre-collision system added the first production image processing chip in a car capable of identifying vehicles and pedestrians in real time, along with millimeter-wavelength radar, stereo cameras, and infrared night vision projectors. A rear pre-collision system with whiplash-preventing active seat headrests and dual-chamber front airbags was also introduced.|$|E
5|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>features</b> on Lexus models {{range from}} {{stability}} and handling programs (Vehicle Stability Control and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management) to backup cameras, swivel headlights, and sonar warning systems. The Lexus Pre-Collision System (PCS) integrates multiple safety systems. In 2007, Lexus introduced the first car safety systems with infrared and pedestrian detection capabilities, lane keep assist, a Driver Monitoring System with facial recognition monitoring of driver attentiveness, and rear pre-collision whiplash protection, {{as part of the}} LS 460 PCS. As a safety precaution, Lexus GPS navigation systems in many regions feature a motion lockout when the vehicle reaches a set speed; to prevent distraction, navigation inputs are limited, while voice input and certain buttons are still accessible. This safety feature has attracted criticism because passengers cannot use certain functions when the vehicle is in motion. Pre-2007 models came with a hidden manufacturer override option, and updated European models allow operation in motion.|$|E

5000|$|A {{gust lock}} can pose a serious safety hazard if its removal is omitted before an aircraft's takeoff, because it renders the flight control inoperative. Many {{internal}} gust locks have a <b>safety</b> <b>feature</b> that locks out the aircraft's throttle or engine-start controls until removed and stowed. External-only gust locks typically lack this <b>safety</b> <b>feature,</b> {{and must be}} tagged with a large red [...] streamer.|$|R

25|$|Over time, {{electrical}} {{codes in}} the US and Canada began to require additional <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> {{in the basic}} NEMA 5-15R and 5-20R configurations to address specific electric shock hazard concerns. The <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> listed below are not mutually exclusive; for example, tamper-resistant GFCI receptacles are available.|$|E
25|$|CH-124A : The Sea King Improvement Program (SKIP) added modernized {{avionics}} {{as well as}} improved <b>safety</b> <b>features.</b>|$|E

25|$|Additionally, Proton has {{announced}} their partnership with LG Electronics {{in the development}} of autonomous safety technology. In September 2014, Proton previewed an Iriz prototype with LG's Advanced Drive Assistance System (ADAS). With the LG ADAS implementation, new autonomous <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> like Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Cross Traffic Assist (CTA), Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) and High Beam Assist (HBA) can be incorporated into Proton's future offerings. The inclusion of autonomous <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> has become a necessary prerequisite for a full 5-Star Euro NCAP and ANCAP rating.|$|E
