The input <b>signal</b> <b>plane</b> is illuminated with the light source by rotating the lens about its optical axis. In this manner, the energy density of coherent noise diffraction patterns as produced by imperfections such as dust and/or bubbles on and/or in the lens is distributed over a ring-shaped area of the output image plane and reduced to a point wherein it can be ignored. The spatial filtering capability of the coherent imaging system is not affected by this noise elimination technique...|$|E

30|$|The system {{performance}} is analyzed in the <b>signaling</b> <b>plane</b> {{and in the}} media plane, respectively. In the <b>signaling</b> <b>plane,</b> we emulate IMS signaling client by SIPp [39]. The prototype system demonstrates that the proposed SIP/SDP extension works compatibly with the standardized IMS platform. We observe that there are notably two kinds of latency: UED collecting and ADTE. The first one is more related to the characteristics of UED themselves. For instance, if the screen size is considered in UED, it could be retrieved immediately by UE. But in terms of available bandwidth, {{it depends on the}} time for sampling. Without considering UED, we further observe that ADTE-incurred delay is 100 ms averagely. To some extent, this result confirms that the metadata-based adaptation is efficient, because the precomputation saves significant time over parameter selection.|$|R

Through our study, {{we found that the}} shortest expected delay gives the best performance when the message size is one. However, when the message size of a request is higher, the shortest expected delay and the round robin scheme perform similarly in most cases while they are both better than uniform random allocation and least response time with network feedback schemes.

In this paper, we present comprehensive analyses on the control (<b>signalling)</b> <b>plane</b> in the IETF Mobile IPv 6, and compare it with the IRTF Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP). The control plane behaviour is important in order to assess the robustness and scalability of the mobility protocol. ILNP has a different mobility model from Mobile IPv 6 : it isa host-based, end-to-end architecture and does not require additional network-layer entities. Hence, the control signals are exchanged only between the end systems. We provide model-based analyses for handoff signalling, and show that ILNP is more efficient than MIPv 6 in terms of robustness and scalability. The analytical models we present could also be adapted for other mobility solutions, for comparative assessment. Postprin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In the <b>signaling</b> <b>plane</b> of an IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) network, the {{interrogating}} Call/Session Control Function (I-CSCF) {{is required}} to choose the serving CSCF (S-CSCF) for user requests arriving at the proxy CSCFs (P-CSCF). This requires S-CSCF selection {{in such a way}} that the response time is minimized. However, in an overloaded situation, the P-CSCF entry points for arriving requests must balance between rejecting new requests and having an acceptable response time from S-CSCF for those that are allowed to enter. In this setting, we consider a number of controls for congestion avoidance that work in conjunction with S-CSCF selection in an IMS Network. For balancing between rejection of requests and the response time, we also propose a composite metric. Through our studies on grid topologies, we observe that one of the avoidance algorithms, the bang-bang control, generally shows to be the most promising toward striking a good balance between rejection of requests and the response time.
