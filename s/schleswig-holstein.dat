5|$|<b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> {{fought in}} both World Wars. During World War I, she saw front-line {{service in the}} II Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet, {{culminating}} in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May– 1 June 1916. <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> saw action during the engagement, and was hit by one large-caliber shell. After the battle, <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> was relegated to guard duty {{in the mouth of}} the Elbe River before being decommissioned in late 1917. As one of the few battleships permitted for Germany by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> was again pressed into fleet service in the 1920s. In 1935, the old battleship was converted into a training ship for naval cadets.|$|E
5|$|<b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> {{was laid}} down on 18 August 1905 at the Germaniawerft {{dockyard}} in Kiel. She was launched on 17 December 1906, the last pre-dreadnought battleship of the German navy. The British battleship —armed with ten 12-inch (30.5cm) guns—had already been commissioned earlier that month, with a revolutionary design that rendered every battleship of the German navy obsolescent, including <b>Schleswig-Holstein.</b> At Schleswig-Holsteins launching ceremony, she was christened by Augusta Victoria of <b>Schleswig-Holstein,</b> the German Empress; Wilhelm II {{was also in}} attendance. Ernst Gunther, the Duke of <b>Schleswig-Holstein,</b> gave the commissioning speech.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, Ohmsen {{initially}} {{worked as}} a government employee of the <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> agricultural ministry. He ran for public office as a candidate of the Schleswig-Holstein-Block in the 1954 Landtag of <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> election. During an election speech, he disparaged the Minister-President of <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> Friedrich-Wilhelm Lübke. Ohmsen was immediately dismissed without notice from his position in the agricultural ministry for insulting the Minister-President. He rejoined the military service of the Bundeswehr on 16 March 1956 as a Kapitänleutnant (Captain Lieutenant) of the Bundesmarine (German Federal Navy). He was promoted to Korvettenkapitän (Corvette Captain) on 15 November 1957 and Fregattenkapitän (Frigate Captain) on 13 August 1965 and retired on 30 September 1967.|$|E
5|$|Early on 1 September 1939, Germany {{launched}} {{an invasion of}} Poland. <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> had been positioned in the port of Danzig, moored close to the Polish ammunition depot at Westerplatte {{under the guise of}} a ceremonial visit in August. At 04:47 on 1 September, <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> opened fire with her main battery at the Polish positions on the Westerplatte, and in doing so fired the first shots of World War II. These shots were the signal for ground troops to begin their assault on the installation; though the first German ground attack in the Battle of Westerplatte was repelled shortly thereafter. A second assault began later that morning, again supported by <b>Schleswig-Holstein,</b> though it too had failed to break into the installation by around noon.|$|E
5|$|<b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> and Schlesien then {{participated in}} the {{occupation}} of Denmark and invasion of Norway, respectively, in April 1940. Afterward, <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> was again removed from front-line service and used as a training ship, while Schlesien resumed her ice-breaking duties. In March 1941, Schlesien escorted mine-layers in the Baltic. After returning from this operation, she became a barracks ship in Gotenhafen.|$|E
5|$|<b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> {{was joined}} on 4 September by the torpedo boats T196 and Von der Gröben. A force of German {{infantry}} and army engineers went ashore {{to take the}} fortress, with heavy fire support from <b>Schleswig-Holstein.</b> The Poles managed to hold off the Germans until {{they were forced to}} surrender on 7 September at 10:30. Following the Polish surrender, <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> began shelling Polish positions at Hel and Redłowo; these operations lasted until 13 September. Between 25 and 27 September, the old battleship returned to Hel with her sister Schlesien; both vessels conducted further bombardments of Polish positions there.|$|E
5|$|<b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> was {{put into}} dock for repairs 10–25 June 1916. The Navy then decided to {{withdraw}} the four remaining Deutschland-class ships, owing to their obsolescence and vulnerability to underwater attacks, {{as demonstrated by the}} loss of Pommern. Thereafter, the ship was used as a target for U-boats, except during 12–23 February 1917 when she was used as a guard ship. In April <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> was sent to Altenbruch {{at the mouth of the}} Elbe; here she was decommissioned on 2 May. <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> was then disarmed and assigned to the 5th U-boat Flotilla to be used as a barracks ship in Bremerhaven. In 1918 the ship was moved to Kiel, where she remained for the rest of the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> was re-boilered and {{converted}} into a cadet training ship. One {{of the most significant}} changes visually was the trunking of the two forward funnels into a single larger smoke stack. Schlesien was made the flagship of the battleship squadron in January 1933. In May 1935, the Reichsmarine was again reorganized as the Kriegsmarine. By this time, only Schlesien and <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> were still operating as warships; the four Braunschweig-class ships had been disposed of or {{converted into a}}uxiliary ships.|$|E
5|$|<b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> {{fired the}} first shots of World War II when she bombarded the Polish base at Danzig's Westerplatte {{in the early}} morning hours of 1 September 1939. The ship was used as a {{training}} vessel for the majority of the war, and was sunk by British bombers in Gotenhafen in December 1944. <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> was subsequently salvaged and then beached for use by the Soviet Navy as a target. As of 1990, the ship's bell was on display in the Bundeswehr Military History Museum in Dresden.|$|E
5|$|The {{terms of}} the Treaty of Versailles, signed on 21 June 1919, {{permitted}} Germany to retain a surface fleet of eight obsolete battleships. This amounted to three of the Deutschland-class battleships, Hannover, <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> and Schlesien, {{as well as the}} five s.|$|E
5|$|Welter {{survived the}} war and was {{employed}} at a sugar factory. He was killed on 7 March 1949 in Leck in <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> waiting at a level crossing, when logs falling from an improperly loaded passing train crushed his car.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, Austria {{called for}} Prussia {{to hand over}} {{administration}} of <b>Schleswig-Holstein,</b> which had until that point been jointly administered by the two powers, to the Duke of Augustenberg. Prussia refused, and Otto von Bismarck sent troops into Austrian-administered Holstein. This provoked war between Austria and Prussia, with Hesse siding with the Austrians, technically making Alice and her sister Victoria enemies.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1916, {{the four}} {{remaining}} ships were withdrawn from service with the fleet. They were placed into reserve on 15 August 1917. Deutschland and <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> became barracks ships in Wilhelmshaven and Kiel, respectively. Hannover {{was used as a}} guard ship in the Danish belt, and Schlesien became a training ship in Kiel. Guns removed from these ships starting in 1917 were used by the Imperial Army in World War I as railway guns.|$|E
5|$|He was {{commissioned}} a second {{lieutenant in the}} Marine Corps on October 9, 1917 and in September {{of the next year}} he sailed for France with the 11th Marines. This regiment saw no combat, but during the last six months of his European tour, he commanded Company D, 15th Separate Marine Battalion, which had been organized {{for the express purpose of}} assisting in the holding of a plebiscite in <b>Schleswig-Holstein,</b> Germany. Owing to the failure of the United States to ratify the Treaty of Versailles, this mission, however, was never carried out.|$|E
5|$|Holstein is {{a station}} on the Sognsvann Line (line 6) of the Oslo Metro in Norway. The station is located between Kringsjå and Østhorn stations. Holstein was opened during the Second World War, in 1941. Formerly Nordberg was the next {{southbound}} station, but it was closed in 1992, {{at the same time}} as Holstein was re-built with longer platforms and new ticket machines. The name Holstein is believed to origin from <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> in Germany.|$|E
5|$|However, {{instead of}} {{being used as a}} coastal defense ship, Deutschland was broken up in 1920–1922. Hannover was to be {{converted}} into a target vessel, although this was never done. She was eventually broken up in 1944–1946. Schlesien and <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> were the only two vessels of the class to see continued front-line service in the Reichsmarine and later the Kriegsmarine. Both ships saw limited duty during World War II, which was inaugurated by the firing of Schleswig-Holsteins main guns at the Polish fortress at Westerplatte. Near {{the end of the war}} the two ships were both sunk.|$|E
5|$|On 17 July 1917, {{to appease}} British {{nationalist}} feelings, King George issued an Order in Council {{that changed the}} name of the British Royal Family to the House of Windsor. He specifically adopted Windsor as the surname for all descendants of Queen Victoria then living in Britain, excluding women who married into other families and their descendants. He and his relatives who were British subjects relinquished the use of all German titles and styles, and adopted English surnames. George compensated several of his male relatives by creating them British peers. Thus, his cousin, Prince Louis of Battenberg, became the Marquess of Milford Haven, while his brother-in-law, the Duke of Teck, became the Marquess of Cambridge. Others, such as Princess Marie Louise of <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> and Princess Helena Victoria of <b>Schleswig-Holstein,</b> simply stopped using their territorial designations. The system for titling {{members of the royal family}} was also simplified. Relatives of the British royal family who fought on the German side were simply cut off; their British peerages were suspended by a 1919 Order in Council under the provisions of the Titles Deprivation Act 1917.|$|E
5|$|Schleswig and Holstein {{were two}} territories fought over between Prussia and Denmark during the First and Second Schleswig Wars. In the latter, Prussia and Austria {{defeated}} Denmark, but the duchies were claimed by Austria for the Prince Christian's family. However, following the Austro-Prussian War, in which Prussia invaded and occupied the duchies, they became Prussian, but the title Duke of <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> was still claimed by Prince Christian's family.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer {{was taken}} {{prisoner}} of war by the British Army in <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> in May 1945. According to Schumann, {{he was taken to}} England for interrogation. In this account British authorities were especially interested in knowing whether his achievements had been made under the influence of methamphetamine or other stimulating psychoactive drugs which induce temporary improvements in either mental or physical functions or both. He was released later that year in November following a bout of diphtheria.|$|E
5|$|The German {{military}} {{then turned}} its attention westward, and in April 1940 invaded Denmark. <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> {{was assigned to}} the naval component of the invasion force. During the invasion, the ship was briefly grounded off the Danish coast. Following the operation, she was transferred back to training duties, as the flagship of the Chief of Training Units. At the end of 1943, the reactivation of <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> was once again contemplated. In her favor was the fact that she retained some coal-fired boilers, given the ever-worsening oil-supply situation. Thus, on 1 February 1944 she was once again recommissioned, at first taking up her old role as a cadet training ship, then later in the year docking at Gotenhafen (Gdynia) for a refit. She was to be converted into a convoy escort ship with a greatly enhanced anti-aircraft armament, but after being hit three times by Royal Air Force bombers on 18 December 1944, she eventually foundered in shallow water. As the ship was permanently disabled, her crew was sent ashore to assist in the defense of Marienburg.|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} contained 245 German and 188 British graves {{at the end}} of the war. This number {{increased in}} the post-war period, as both British and German remains from numerous isolated burial locations were concentrated to St. Symphorien until the cemetery reached its current number of 284 German soldiers and 229 Commonwealth soldiers. Most of the identified German dead in the cemetery died in 1914 and were from units of IX Corps, which originated from the north of Germany from towns like Kiel, Hamburg and Bremen, and in <b>Schleswig-Holstein.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beatrice and Henry {{were married}} at Saint Mildred's Church at Whippingham, near Osborne, on 23 July 1885. Beatrice, who wore her mother's wedding veil of Honiton lace, was escorted by the Queen and Beatrice's eldest brother, the Prince of Wales. Princess Beatrice was {{attended}} by ten royal bridesmaids from among her nieces: Princess Alix and Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine; Princess Alexandra, Princess Marie, and Princess Victoria Melita of Edinburgh; Princess Louise, Princess Maud, and Princess Victoria of Wales; Princess Marie Louise and Princess Helena Victoria of <b>Schleswig-Holstein.</b> The bridegroom's supporters were his brothers, Prince Alexander of Bulgaria and Prince Francis Joseph of Battenberg.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the {{following}} year, Alexandra's father had ascended the throne of Denmark, her brother George had become King of the Hellenes, her sister Dagmar was engaged to the Tsesarevich of Russia, and Alexandra had given birth to her first child. Her father's accession gave rise to further conflict over the fate of <b>Schleswig-Holstein.</b> The German Confederation successfully invaded Denmark, reducing the area of Denmark by two-fifths. To the great irritation of Queen Victoria and the Crown Princess of Prussia, Alexandra and Albert Edward supported the Danish side in the war. The Prussian conquest of former Danish lands heightened Alexandra's profound dislike of the Germans, a feeling which stayed with her {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte was a {{favourite}} of her paternal grandparents, {{whom she}} frequently saw. King Wilhelm and Queen Augusta spoiled their granddaughter and encouraged her {{rebellion against the}} Crown Prince and Princess, and Charlotte and her brother frequently took their side in disputes with her parents. This rebellion was encouraged by the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who held political disagreements with the liberal Crown Prince and Princess. Charlotte also enjoyed {{a close relationship with}} her eldest brother, though they grew apart after his marriage in 1881 to Augusta Victoria of <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> ("Dona"), a princess described by Charlotte as plain, slow-witted, and shy. Charlotte's relationship with Wilhelm would remain troubled as a result.|$|E
5|$|Despite his socialist and pro-Soviet beliefs, Crawford {{believed}} in collaborating with all foreign archaeologists, regardless of political or ideological differences. In early 1938, he lectured on aerial archaeology at the German Air Ministry; the Ministry published his lecture as Luftbild und Vorgeschichte, and Crawford was frustrated that the British {{government did not}} publish his work with the same enthusiasm. From there, he visited Vienna to meet with his friend, the archaeologist Oswald Menghin; Menghin took Crawford to an event celebrating the Anschluss, at which he met the prominent Nazi Josef Bürckel. Shortly after, he holidayed in <b>Schleswig-Holstein,</b> where German archaeologists took {{him to see the}} Danevirke.|$|E
5|$|During Queen Victoria's widowhood, Edward {{pioneered the}} idea of royal public {{appearances}} as we understand them today—for example, opening the Thames Embankment in 1871, the Mersey Tunnel in 1886, and Tower Bridge in 1894—but his mother did not allow Edward {{an active role in}} the running of the country until 1898. He was sent summaries of important government documents, but she refused to give him access to the originals. He annoyed his mother by siding with Denmark on the <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> Question in 1864 (she was pro-German) and in the same year annoyed her again by making a special effort to meet Giuseppe Garibaldi. Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone sent him papers secretly. From 1886, Foreign Secretary Lord Rosebery sent him Foreign Office despatches, and from 1892 some Cabinet papers were opened to him.|$|E
5|$|Germany, {{which lost}} most of its fleet {{under the terms of}} the Versailles treaty, was allowed to keep eight pre-dreadnoughts (of which only six could be in active service at any one time) which were counted as {{armoured}} coast-defence ships; two of these were still in use at the beginning of World War II. One of these, , shelled the Polish Westerplatte peninsula during the opening of the German invasion of Poland. <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> served for most of the war as a training ship; she was sunk while under refit in December 1944, and broken up in situ in January 1945. The other, , was mined and then scuttled in March 1945.|$|E
5|$|In 1842, Ernest married Princess Alexandrine of Baden in {{what was}} to be a childless marriage. Soon after, he succeeded as duke upon {{the death of his father}} on 29 January 1844. As reigning Duke Ernest II, he {{supported}} the German Confederation in the <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> Wars against Denmark, sending thousands of troops and becoming the commander of a German corps; as such, he was instrumental in the 1849 victory at the battle of Eckernförde against Danish forces. After King Otto of Greece was deposed in 1862, the British government put Ernest's name forward as a possible successor. Negotiations fell through however for various reasons, not in the least of which was that he would not give up his beloved duchies in favor of the Greek throne.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, King Christian VIII of Denmark {{died and}} his only son, Frederick ascended the throne. Frederick was childless, {{had been through}} two {{unsuccessful}} marriages, and {{was assumed to be}} infertile. A succession crisis arose as Frederick ruled in both Denmark and <b>Schleswig-Holstein,</b> and the succession rules of each territory differed. In Holstein, the Salic law prevented inheritance through the female line, whereas no such restrictions applied in Denmark. Holstein, being predominantly German, proclaimed independence and called in the aid of Prussia. In 1852, the great powers called a conference in London to discuss the Danish succession. An uneasy peace was agreed, which included the provision that Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg would be Frederick's heir in all his dominions and the prior claims of others (who included Christian's own mother-in-law, brother-in-law and wife) were surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Lützow {{was born}} on 4 September 1912 in Kiel, {{at the time the}} capital of the Province of <b>Schleswig-Holstein,</b> a {{province}} of the Kingdom of Prussia. He was the third of five children of Friedrich Lützow, a naval officer, and his wife Hildegard, née Kinzel. He had an older brother, Werner, an older sister, Liselotte (Elisabeth Charlotte), a younger sister, Hildegard, and a younger brother, Joachim. The family at the time lived at the Reventlouallee 23 on {{the west bank of the}} Kieler Förde. This was close to the German Imperial Naval Academy where his father attended a two-year Admiralty Staff training course. Following the outbreak of World War I, his father was posted to the staff of the Führer der Unterseeboote (Commander of Submarines) Fregattenkapitän (Frigate Captain) Hermann Bauer, and the family had to move to Wilhelmshaven.|$|E
5|$|Many {{members of}} the upper classes played for the side {{throughout}} their first-class years. Among these were Prince Christian Victor of <b>Schleswig-Holstein,</b> {{the only member of}} the British Royal Family to have played first-class cricket. Members of the peerage also played for I Zingari, including Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley, Beilby Lawley, 3rd Baron Wenlock, Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke and George Harris, 4th Baron Harris. At least three players were Members of Parliament, chief among them Alfred Lyttelton and Edward Stanhope who were both {{members of the}} Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Cecil Wilson, who appeared for the side twice, also served as an Anglican Bishop of Melanesia and Bishop of Bunbury.|$|E
5|$|On 24 February 1944, the Eighth Air Force {{attempted}} {{to repeat the}} success of 20 February. 1st and 2nd Divisions flew due east towards Germany and the 3rd Division east-northeast without escort. After crossing into <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> they attacked targets along the Baltic sea coast. The 1st and 2nd Divisions {{were considered to be}} the main thrust of the attack and the 3rd Division went unmolested. The B-24 bombers of the 2nd Division were scheduled to bomb Gotha and JG 1 were directed to attack these B-24s. Due to strong tailwinds and flying at lower altitude, the bombers were separated from their escorting fighters and JG 1 reached Gotha before the bombers. Major Heinz Bär led II./JG 1 in a diving attack and claimed four B-24s while I./JG 1 attacked head-on and claimed five B-24s downed.|$|E
5|$|Six {{units were}} leased by CFL between 2000 and 2004. The Luxembourgian State Railways were {{in need of}} new diesel {{locomotives}} to overcome the three different electrification systems in use. Because of a three-year waiting time for new locomotives, CFL leased the Di6 units for freight trains between Esch-sur-Alzette, Bettembourg and Mertert. In November 2003, the locomotives were sold to Vossloh and given the designation DE 2700. Since 2006, the main leaser is the Veolia Verkehr-owned Nord-Ostsee-Bahn, which operates passenger trains in <b>Schleswig-Holstein,</b> Germany. Eight locomotives are used to haul six to ten-car passengers trains on the route between Hamburg and Sylt. In 2008, three locomotives returned to Norway, when Cargolink leased them for their new autorack freight operations. In 2009, NOB transferred its ninth unit to HSL Logistik.|$|E
5|$|The couple {{established}} Marlborough House {{as their}} London residence and Sandringham House in Norfolk as their country retreat. They entertained on a lavish scale. Their marriage met with disapproval in certain circles {{because most of}} Queen Victoria's relations were German, and Denmark was at loggerheads with Germany over the territories of Schleswig and Holstein. When Alexandra's father inherited the throne of Denmark in November 1863, the German Confederation {{took the opportunity to}} invade and annex <b>Schleswig-Holstein.</b> Queen Victoria was of two minds whether it was a suitable match given the political climate. After the marriage, she expressed anxiety about their socialite lifestyle and attempted to dictate to them on various matters, including the names of their children.|$|E
5|$|The party truce {{ended in}} 1864, with Tories outraged over Palmerston's {{handling}} of the territorial dispute between the German Confederation and Denmark known as the <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> Question. Disraeli had little help from Derby, who was ill, but he united the party enough on a no-confidence vote to limit the government to a majority of 18—Tory defections and absentees kept Palmerston in office. Despite rumours about Palmerston's health as he passed his eightieth birthday, he remained personally popular, and the Liberals increased their margin in the July 1865 general election. In {{the wake of the}} poor election results, Derby predicted to Disraeli that neither of them would ever hold office again.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{base for}} the High Seas Fleet in the North Sea was Wilhelmshaven {{on the western side}} of the Jade Bight; the port of Cuxhaven, located on the mouth of the Elbe, was also a major base in the North Sea. The island of Heligoland {{provided}} a fortified forward position in the German Bight. Kiel was the most important base in the Baltic, which supported the forward bases at Pillau and Danzig. The Kaiser Wilhelm Canal through <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> connected the Baltic and North Seas and allowed the German Navy to quickly shift naval forces between the two seas. In peacetime, all ships on active duty in the High Seas Fleet were stationed in Wilhelmshaven, Kiel, or Danzig. Germany possessed only one major overseas base, at Kiautschou in China, where the East Asia Squadron was stationed.|$|E
