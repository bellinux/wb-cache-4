First, Gary and Jackie Ohman, of Battle Creek, sighted an immature gray phase male Gyrafalcon about 3 miles west of Thedford, Thomas Co., on 25 September 1979. On 11 November 1979 I observed an immature male gray phase Gyrafalcon about 12 miles southwest of Minden, Kearney Co. I was able to approach as close as 20 feet from the bird in my car.

6000|$|... "And as {{for this}} romance of love," [...] the young nobleman went on, {{kindling}} as he spoke, and forgetting the slang and colloquialisms {{with which we}} garnish all our conversation--"this fine picture of Jenny and Jessamy falling in love at first <b>sight,</b> <b>billing</b> and cooing in an arbour, and retiring to a cottage afterwards to go on cooing and billing--Psha! what folly is this! It is good for romances, and for misses to sigh about; but any man who walks through the world with his eyes open, knows how senseless is all this rubbish. I don't say that {{a young man and}} woman are not to meet, and to fall in love that instant, and to marry that day year, and love each other till they are a hundred; that is the supreme lot--but that is the lot which the gods only grant to Baucis and Philemon, and a very, very few besides. As for the rest, they must compromise; make themselves as comfortable as they can, and take {{the good and the bad}} together. And as for Jenny and Jessamy, by Jove! look round among your friends, count up the love matches, and see what has been the end of most of them! Love in a cottage! Who is to pay the landlord for the cottage? Who is to pay for Jenny's tea and cream, and Jessamy's mutton-chops? If he has cold mutton, he will quarrel with her. If there is nothing in the cupboard, a pretty meal they make. No, you cry out against people in our world making money marriages. Why, kings and queens marry on the same understanding. My butcher has saved a stockingful of money, and marries his daughter to a young salesman; Mr. and Mrs. Salesman prosper in life, and get an alderman's daughter for their son. My attorney looks out amongst his clients for an eligible husband for Miss Deeds; sends his son to the bar, into Parliament, where he cuts a figure and becomes attorney-general, makes a fortune, has a house in Belgrave Square, and marries Miss Deeds of the second generation to a peer. Do not accuse us of being more sordid than our neighbours. We do but as the world does; and a girl in our society accepts the best party which offers itself, just as Miss Chummey, when entreated by two young gentlemen of the order of costermongers, inclines to the one who rides from market on a moke, rather than to the gentleman who sells his greens from a handbasket." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, Armitage was axed by series {{producer}} Brian Park who {{had written}} out many characters as part a revamp of Coronation Street. Park told Jan Disley and John Millar from the Daily Record {{that it was a}} tough decision but he had to consider the future of the serial. Armitage said that Bill {{was one of the best}} parts he had ever played and admitted that he had a [...] "touch of sadness" [...] about departing. Sherrie Hewson who plays Maureen Holdsworth was also axed by Park. Bill and Maureen were written out of Coronation Street in a shared storyline; which saw the pair running away to be together, soon after she had married Fred Elliott (John Savident). A spokesperson from the serial told the Daily Mirror Paul Byrne that Maureen knows that marrying Fred was the wrong choice and she sets her <b>sights</b> on <b>Bill</b> once again. Hewson was unhappy with Bill and Maureen's affair because she did not think it was convincing. While interviewed by John Millar from the Daily Record, the actress stated: [...] "I voiced my opinion nine months earlier. I just knew that it felt wrong and uncomfortable. Bill might have mended Maureen's pipes, but she wouldn't have had an affair with him." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{raised my}} eyes gratefully as I {{swallowed}} a mouthful; next moment my head sank heavily upon my arm, and I fell fast asleep. I slept long, for when I awoke {{the sun was}} a good way above the horizon. I did not move on first opening my eyes, as I felt a delightful sensation of rest pervading me, and my eyes were riveted on and charmed with the gorgeous splendour of the mighty ocean that burst upon my sight. It was a dead calm; the sea seemed a sheet of undulating crystal, tipped and streaked with the saffron hues of sunrise, which had not yet merged into the glowing heat of noon; and there was a deep calm in the blue dome above that was not broken even by the usual flutter of the sea-fowl. How long I would have lain in contemplation of this peaceful scene I know not, but my mind was recalled suddenly and painfully to {{the past and the present}} by the <b>sight</b> of <b>Bill,</b> who was seated on the deck at my feet, with his head reclining, as if in sleep, on his right arm, which rested on the tiller. As he seemed to rest peacefully, I did not mean to disturb him; but the slight noise I made in raising myself on my elbow caused him to start and look round.|$|R

Additionally, Niehus and Mitchell made an interesting series of observations regarding migratory and feeding behavior of wintering Prairie Falcons. Immediately following a major snow storm in early December 1979, with snow cover extending east to the Minden area, but with little snow east of there, they drove country roads between York and Minden. During {{a day and a}} half they sighted over 30 different Prairie Falcons. Very many wintering Horned Larks and other birds were sighted in this area extending from the snow line east, and the Falcons had a bountiful food supply. However, west of this snow line only a few Falcons were sighted in correlation with fewer observed Larks. - Ben G. Ohlander, 9808 Browne Street, Omaha, 6813...|$|R

50|$|The {{polygamy}} {{implicit in}} Beadley's scheme appalls some group members, especially the religious Miss Durrant, but before this schism can be dealt with, {{a man called}} Wilfred Coker stages a fire at the university and kidnaps a number of <b>sighted</b> individuals, including <b>Bill</b> and Josella. They are each chained to a blind person and assigned to lead a squadron of the blind, collecting food and other supplies, while beset by escaped triffids and rival scavengers. When Masen's followers are dying of an unknown disease he attempts to find Josella, but his only lead is an address left behind by Beadley's group. Joined by a repentant Coker, Masen drives to the address, a country estate called Tynsham in Wiltshire, but finds neither Beadley nor Josella. After some days, Masen finds Josella at her friends' country home in Sussex, while Coker returns to Tynsham and later rejoins Beadley. En route, Masen is joined by a young sighted girl named Susan. Along with other refugees, some of them blind, they attempt to establish a self-sufficient colony in Sussex, menaced chiefly by triffids. Years pass until a helicopter pilot representative of Beadley's faction reports that his group has established a colony on the Isle of Wight. Masen and his followers are reluctant to leave their own colony but are provoked {{to do so by}} soldiers of a despotic new government. After feigning agreement with the latter's plans, the Masens disable the soldiers' vehicle and flee to the Isle of Wight, determined to one day destroy the triffids and reclaim Earth.|$|R
60|$|Now, Mrs. Elmore {{was not a}} hard-hearted woman, and if Ellen {{had come}} as a beggar to solicit help for her sick mother, Mrs. Elmore would have fitted out a basket of provisions, and sent a bottle of wine, and a bundle of old clothes, and all the et cetera of such occasions; but the <b>sight</b> of a <b>bill</b> always aroused all the instinctive {{sharpness}} of her business-like education. She never had the dawning of an {{idea that it was}} her duty to pay any body any more than she could possibly help; nay, she had an indistinct notion that it was her duty as an economist to make every body take as little as possible. When she and her daughters lived in Spring Street, to which she had alluded, they used to spend the greater part of their time at home, and the family sewing was commonly done among themselves. But since they had moved into a large house, and set up a carriage, and addressed themselves to being genteel, the girls found that they had altogether too much to do to attend to their own sewing, much less to perform any for their father and brothers. And their mother found her hands abundantly full in overlooking her large house, in taking care of expensive furniture, and in superintending her increased train of servants. The sewing, therefore, was put out; and Mrs. Elmore felt it a duty to get it done the cheapest way she could. Nevertheless, Mrs. Elmore was too notable a lady, and her sons and daughters were altogether too fastidious as to the make and quality of their clothing, to admit the idea of its being done in any but the most complete and perfect manner.|$|R
