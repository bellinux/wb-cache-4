25|$|Fulminant disease {{correlates}} {{with more than}} ten bowel movements daily, continuous bleeding, toxicity, abdominal tenderness and distension, blood transfusion requirement and colonic dilation (expansion). Patients in this category may have inflammation extending beyond just the mucosal layer, causing impaired colonic motility and leading to toxic megacolon. If the <b>serous</b> <b>membrane</b> is involved, a colonic perforation may ensue. Unless treated, the fulminant disease will soon lead to death.|$|E
25|$|A <b>serous</b> <b>membrane</b> (also {{referred}} to as a serosa) is a thin membrane that covers the walls of organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. The serous membranes have two layers; parietal and visceral, surrounding a fluid filled space. The visceral layer of the membrane covers the organ (the viscera), and the parietal layer lines the walls of the body cavity (pariet- refers to a cavity wall). Between the parietal and visceral layers is a very thin, fluid-filled serous space, or cavity. For example, the pericardium is the serous cavity which surrounds the heart.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It {{was shown}} {{previously}} that ovarian tumours, which frequently metastasise to serous surfaces, {{can be produced}} in dogs by prolonged administration of stilboestrol. The ability of non-ovarian serous surfaces to proliferate in response to stilboestrol, independently of ovarian metastases, was studied in 5 ovariectomised females and 4 entire males. Papillary proliferations occurred on the uterine serosae in 3 females and on the testicular and epididymal serosae in 2 males. In no case was there papillary proliferation on <b>serous</b> <b>membranes</b> of non-genital organs. One of 2 entire females given stillboestrol had proliferations regarded as metastases of ovarian origin on non-genital <b>serous</b> <b>membranes.</b> It is concluded that, in addition to ovarian changes, stilboestrol can cause primary proliferative lesions in the <b>serous</b> <b>membranes</b> of certain genital organs in both sexes. There {{is no evidence that}} <b>serous</b> <b>membranes</b> of non-genital organs be capable of a primary proliferative response to stilboestrol. JABARA [I, 21 found that ovarian tumours could be produced in dogs by the prolonged administration of stilboestrol.

500|$|The {{pericardium}} {{surrounds the}} heart. It {{consists of two}} membranes: an inner <b>serous</b> <b>membrane</b> called the epicardium, and an outer fibrous membrane. [...] Blood vessels and nerves reach the cardiac muscle from the epicardium. These help influence the heart rate. These enclose the pericardial cavity which contains the [...] pericardial fluid that lubricates {{the surface of the}} heart.|$|E
2500|$|The {{outside of}} the bladder is {{protected}} by a <b>serous</b> <b>membrane.</b> The bladder wall itself is smooth muscle. [...] The inner side of the bladder is lined with a mucosal membrane consisting of a surface glycocalyx that protects the cells beneath it from urine, the urothelium (a form of transitional epithelium), a basement membrane, and the lamina propria. The mucosal lining also offers a urothelial barrier against the passing of infections.|$|E
60|$|Section 29. The {{nature of}} the amnion will be {{understood}} by following Figures 4b, 5, and 6 on Sheet 23. The three embryonic layers are indicated by broken lines, dots, and black lines, {{just as they are}} in the frog diagrams. Not only is the embryo slowly pinched off from the yolk sac (y.s.), but, as the yolk is absorbed beneath it, and it grows in size, it sinks into the space thus made, the extra-embryonic somatopleur and epiblast rise up round it as two folds, which are seen closing in 5, and closed in 6, over the dorsal side of the young chick. In this way a cavity, a., lined by epiblast, and called the amniotic cavity, is formed. Dorsal to this, in 6, comes a space lined by somatic mesoblast, and continuous with p.p., the pleuro-peritoneal cavity, or body cavity of the embryo. Outside this, again, is a layer, of somatopleur internally and epiblast externally, the false amnion (f.a.), which is continuous with the <b>serous</b> <b>membrane</b> (s.m.) enclosing the rest of the egg. The student should, carefully copy these diagrams, with coloured pencils or inks for the different layers, and should compare them with the more realistic renderings of Figures 2, 5, and 8, Sheet 24.|$|E

60|$|Section 38. But the allantois and {{yolk sac}} of the rabbit, though they {{correspond}} in development, differ entirely in function from the similar organs of the fowl. The yolk sac {{is of the}} very smallest nutritive value; instead of being the sole source of food, its contents scarcely avail the young rabbit at all as nourishment. Its presence in development is difficult to account for except on the supposition, that it was once of far greater importance. At an early stage, the outgrowing allantois, pushing {{in front of it}} the <b>serous</b> <b>membrane,</b> is closely applied to the lining of the mother's uterus. The maternal uterus and the embryonic allantois send out finger-like processes into each other which interlock, and the tissue between the abundant bloodvessels in them thins down {{to such an extent that}} nutritive material, peptones and carbohydrates, and oxygen also, diffuse freely through it from mother to foetus,* and carbon dioxide, water, and urea from the foetus to the mother. The structure thus formed by the union of the wall of the maternal uterus, allantois, and the intermediate structures is called the placenta. Through its intermediation, the young rabbit becomes, as it were, rooted and parasitic on the mother, and utilizes her organs for its own alimentation, respiration, and excretion. It gives off CO2, H2O, and urea, by the placenta, and it receives O and elaborated food material through the same organ. This is the better method that has superseded the yolk.|$|E

5000|$|Fibrinous inflammation: Inflammation {{resulting}} in a large increase in vascular permeability allows fibrin {{to pass through the}} blood vessels.

This is commonly seen in serous cavities, where the conversion of fibrinous exudate into a scar can occur between <b>serous</b> <b>membranes,</b> limiting their function. The deposit sometimes forms a pseudomembrane sheet. During inflammation of the intestine (Pseudomembranous colitis), pseudomembranous tubes can be formed.|$|R
