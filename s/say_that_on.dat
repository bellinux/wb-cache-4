5|$|General Edward Braddock left Observatory Hill in Georgetown in 1755 on an {{expedition}} to capture the French Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War. Braddock's expedition was surprised on July 9 {{in the vicinity of}} present-day Braddock, Pennsylvania, in what is now known as the Battle of the Monongahela. Nearly 900 of Braddock's 1,300 men were killed or wounded, and Braddock himself killed. Since before the American Civil War, witnesses <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> the anniversary of Braddock's departure they can hear shouted military orders, horses' hooves on cobblestones, the sound of men marching, and the sound of metal clanking against metal. The sounds can be heard near the old Long Bridge or near the Georgetown bluffs overlooking the Potomac River.|$|E
25|$|Filipović (later {{known as}} Tomislav Filipović-Majstorović) was {{assigned}} to II Poglavnik Bodyguard Battalion. Statements by two eyewitnesses and a senior German general <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> 7 February 1942, Filipović accompanied elements of his battalion in an operation aimed at wiping out Serbs in the settlement of Drakulić, on the northern outskirts of Banja Luka, and in two neighbouring villages, Motike and Šargovac. A few Serbs survived, but overwhelmingly the operation achieved its objective; more than 2,300 Serb civilians– men, women and children– were killed, usually with axes or pick-axes.|$|E

After the death of Muhammad {{there was no longer}} the question of any spiritual representation; the issue was only temporal representation, and for this Abu Bakr was the best choice as he had thus represented Muhammad even in his lifetime.|$|E

500|$|During the campaign, several {{relatives}} of people killed during The Troubles {{objected to the}} prospect of a former IRA member, McGuinness, becoming President. On 10 October, McGuinness was confronted in Athlone by the son of a member of the Irish Army killed by the IRA after Don Tidey's kidnap in Ballinamore in 1983. [...] In a RTÉ interview that aired on 20 October, Bryan Dobson noted a 1985 Hot Press interview in which McGuinness indicated that he considered the IRA volunteers at Ballinamore to be [...] "defending themselves against armed Gardaí and soldiers." [...] When Dobson then asked if it was [...] "fair to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> this occasion you were standing over the killing of members of the Gardaí and Defence Forces?" [...] McGuinness insisted that he has [...] "never done that." [...] The family of Garda Detective Frank Hand, killed in 1984, accused McGuinness of misleading younger generations with a [...] "glossy campaign". The husband of a mother killed by the IRA in 1981 said he doubted McGuinness' claims of ignorance about the identities of IRA killers, saying [...] "If anybody knows who did it, he does. If he is full of apologies he has never apologised to me".|$|E
500|$|Ponsford {{travelled}} to England for {{a second}} time, with the 1930 Australian team. In a wet summer, Australia won the series two Tests to one, recovering The Ashes. For {{the second time in}} as many trips to England, Ponsford fell ill—gastritis caused him to miss the third Test at Headingley Stadium. Despite this setback, Ponsford scored 330runs in the Tests at an average of 55.00. Wisden wrote, [...] "Ponsford had a much better season—especially in the Test matches—than four years previously.... In helping his captain to wear down England's bowling he accomplished great work and, even if he was seldom really attractive to watch, there could be no question about his skill and how difficult he was to get out." [...] The outstanding performer of the tour was the young Don Bradman, who scored 974runs in the Test matches—this remains a world record for the most runs scored in a Test series. Ponsford played a part in Bradman's success; Wisden stated that [...] "it is only fair to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> more than one occasion [...] task was rendered the easier by the skilful manner in which Woodfull and Ponsford, by batting of different description, had taken the sting out of the England bowling." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{victory was}} {{followed}} up with {{an attack on the}} city of Dublin. Brian’s forces marched quickly to Dublin (again confirming a Saggart-Ardclough location for the battle) reaching the town on New Year’s Eve 999. They entered its defences without any great resistance and the Annals of Innisfallen <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> <b>on</b> New Year’s Day (the Kalends of January) 1000, they burned both the settlement itself and the nearby wood known as Caill Tomair which apparently stood {{on the north side of}} the Liffey. The plunder of the town, for the second time in ten years, is described in considerable detail in the Cogaidh. [...] The 12th century Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh gives two accounts of the occupation: that Brian remained in Dublin from Christmas Day until Epiphany (6 January), or from Christmas Day until St. Brigid's Day (1 February). The later Annals of Ulster gives a date of 30 December for the Battle of Glenmama, while Annals of Inisfallen dates Brian's capture of the city two days later, to 1 January 1000. According to the much more reliable Annals of the Four Masters and the Chronicon Scotorum, Dublin was only occupied for a week by Munster forces. In any case, in 1000 Brian plundered the city, burned the Norse fortress and expelled its ruler, King Sigtrygg Silkbeard. Ailbhe Mac Shamhráin wrote: ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{scholars}} have {{raised questions about}} Surratt's move into the city. Historians Kate Larson and Roy Chamlee have noted that {{although there is no}} definite proof, a case can be made that Surratt made the move into the city in furtherance of her and her son's espionage activities. For example, Larson and Chamlee <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> September 21, 1864, John Surratt wrote to Louis J. Weichmann, observing that the family's plans to move into the city were advancing rapidly [...] "on account of certain events having turned up," [...] perhaps a cryptic reference to either his Confederate activities in general or the conspiracy to kidnap or kill Lincoln. Larson has observed that although the move made long-term economic sense for Surratt, it also, in the short term, would have meant moving expenses and furnishing up to 10 rooms in the townhouse, money that she did not have.|$|E

[...] Indeed, some <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> witnessing the fearful havoc caused by this opening volley from the French guns, both officers and men began to scamper off from the entrenchments; a statement which, however, cannot be altogether correct, since the number of soldiers suffering from frontal wounds, who afterwards found their way to the mission hospital at Tai-wan-fu showed conclusively that not a few of those poor matter-of-fact Chinamen must have made a noble stand against the invaders of their country.|$|E
2500|$|In total, ten {{cities were}} {{involved}} in the marketing campaign, which began two to three weeks before the incident in Boston. The NYPD contacted Interference, Inc., to request a list of 41 locations where the devices were installed. Officers were able to locate and remove only two devices, both located near 33rd Street and West Side Highway at the High Line overpass. The NYPD did not receive any complaints about the devices, according to police spokesman Paul Brown. At 9:30p.m. on the evening of January 31, the Chicago Police Department received a list of installation locations from Interference, Inc. Police recovered and disposed of 20 of the 35 devices. Police Superintendent Philip Cline admonished those responsible for the campaign, stating, [...] "one of the devices could have easily been mistaken for a bomb and set off enough panic to alarm the entire city." [...] Cline went on to <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> <b>on</b> February 1, he asked Turner Broadcasting to reimburse the city for funds spent on locating and disposing of the devices. Two men were briefly held in connection to the incident.|$|E
2500|$|After the war, Minister of Armaments Albert Speer {{was asked}} by both British and American interrogators on {{separate}} occasions which air force had a superior bombing strategy. The exact wording of the question was [...] "Which, at various periods of the war, caused more concern; British or American heavy bomber attacks, day or night attacks, and why?". In both cases, Speer replied: [...] "The American attacks which followed a definite system assault on industrial targets, were {{by far the most}} dangerous. It was in fact those attacks which caused the breakdown of the German armaments industry." [...] Speer went on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> three occasions, {{a relatively small number of}} bombing raids (on ball bearings and on the dams in 1943, and on oil and transportation in 1944–1945) nearly collapsed the entire German war machine. That this didn't fully happen was largely thanks to Bomber Command's leader Sir Arthur Harris diverting planes from those tasks to his area bombing operations. Intercepted German intelligence from 1943 to 1945 made clear that the American destruction of oil and transportation facilities had a vastly greater impact on the fighting ability of the Wehrmacht than British area bombing operations.|$|E
