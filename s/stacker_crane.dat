The entire unit moves horizontally within an aisle, while the shuttles are able to elevate up to the necessary height to reach the load, and can extend and retract to store or retrieve loads that are several positions deep in the shelving.

40|$|When {{multiple}} systems work in {{the same}} physical environment, it is important to ensure that no collisions occur. This thesis is focused on the centralized offline coordination of such collaborating systems, with the condition that the spatial path each system travels along is known before hand. In addition to collisions, dynamic constraints as well as optimization of a performance criterion are considered. The problem is decomposed into two parts, a sequencing problem and coordination subproblem. For the sequencing problem, an algorithmic improvement is proposed, where constraint propagation methods from the computer science community are introduced to improve existing mixed integer nonlinear programming methods used in mathematical programming. The coordination subproblem on the other hand is approached from a modeling perspective. By applying state space discretization and variable changes, two models are derived, one which is entirely convex. Also, a two stage abstraction approach is introduced, where dynamic programming is used to parameterize part of the problem, resulting in a much simpler model at the next stage. The above methods can be used for minimum energy coordination of industrial robots. Experimental results from the two robot case study are presented. In addition, the one robot case is also studied, where the execution time, robot payload and minimization criteria are varied. Furthermore, the application of the presented methods to hybrid systems is also discussed. Finally, the slightly different problem of minimum time <b>stacker</b> <b>crane</b> scheduling is considered. In the <b>stacker</b> <b>crane</b> problem, a number of tasks should be allocated to a set of robots moving along the same one dimensional track.

Cranes provide less flexibility in movement than industrial trucks because they only can operate within a restricted area, though some can operate on a portable base.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, {{increasing}} numbers of automatic warehousing systems using computer-controlled <b>stacker</b> <b>cranes</b> have been installed. Our research concerns the scientific scheduling and design of these systems. There are three elements to scheduling: the assignment of multiple items to the same pallet (Pallet Assignment); the assignment of pallet loads to storage locations (Storage Assignment); and rules for sequencing storage and retrieve requests (Interleaving). This paper deals with optimal storage assignment. Results are obtained which compare the operating performance of three storage assignment rules: random assignment, {{which is similar to}} the closest-open-location rule used by many currently operating systems; full turnover-based assignment: and class-based turnover assignment. It is shown that significant reductions in crane travel time (and distance) are obtainable from turnover-based rules. These improvements can, under certain circumstances, be directly translated into increased throughput capacity for existing systems, and may be used to alter the design (e. g., size and number of racks, speed of cranes, etc.) of proposed systems in order to achieve a more desirable system balance between throughput and storage capacity. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Demand-responsive {{transport}} (DRT) systems, where users generate {{requests for}} transportation from a pickup {{point to a}} delivery point, are expected to increase in usage dramatically as the inconvenience of privately-owned cars in metropolitan areas becomes excessive.

40|$|Pickup and {{delivery}} problems (PDPs), in which objects or {{people have to}} be transported between specific locations, are among the most common combinatorial problems in real-world operations. One particular PDP is the <b>Stacker</b> <b>Crane</b> problem (SCP), where each commodity/customer is associated with a pickup location and a delivery location, and the objective is to find a minimum-length tour visiting all locations with the constraint that each pickup location and its associated delivery location are visited in consecutive order. The SCP is a route optimization problem behind several transportation systems, e. g., Transportation-On-Demand (TOD) systems. The SCP is NP-Hard and the best know approximation algorithm only provides a 9 / 5 approximation ratio. We present an algorithm for the stochastic SCP which: (i) is asymptotically optimal, i. e., it produces a solution approaching the optimal one as the number of pickups/deliveries goes to infinity; and (ii) has computational complexity O(n[superscript 2 +ϵ]), where n is the number of pickup/delivery pairs and ϵ is an arbitrarily small positive constant.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this work is in {{simulating}} an automated storage and retrieval system (AS/RS) and validating that the system works as expected. AS/RSs can be complex systems and development project of an AS/RS can last for several years. Therefore, there is need for a solution that helps the stakeholders to validate that the designed system works as expected. The solution offered in this work is discrete-event simulation of an AS/RS. The simulated example AS/RS consists of <b>stacker</b> <b>cranes</b> moving on aisles, high bay racking, industrial robots, conveyor system, AGV connection, and packing stations. The amount of devices and high capacity requirements make the simulated system complex. The simulated system is under development during the thesis writing process {{so most of the}} details about the system functionality are available. However, some uncertainty causing assumptions are required to simulate the AS/RS. The goal of this work is divided in three research questions. The first research question is concerning the requirements for simulation platform to simulate an AS/RS. The identified requirements are general flexibility and usability requirements; ability to model required devices, warehouse management system, and material flow; and ability to gather the required performance measurements. The second research question deals with the material flow simulations. The material flow simulations present that the example AS/RS can fill the required maximum infeed amounts but outfeed amounts cannot be filled. The reason for this is too low capacity of industrial robots. The third research question is about sensitivity analysis. Firstly, the results present that the realized outfeed amounts are sensitive for variation in robot movement times. If times increase, the realized outfeed amounts decrease significantly. Secondly, the realized infeed amounts are slightly sensitive for total delay of <b>stacker</b> <b>cranes.</b> If delay increases, the realized infeed amount drops a bit. Thirdly, the example AS/RS is not sensitive for variation in storage utilization. This is the benefit of random storage strategy. Based on the results of this work, the industrial robots are the bottleneck of the example AS/RS. On average, the utilization ratios of industrial robots are 97 % during the maximum infeed and outfeed amount simulations. With better routing of the piles, also the rest of the capacity could be utilized that would lead to higher realized infeed and outfeed amounts. However, then the system would be quite unreliable. Based on the results of this work, the industrial robots require more capacity if designed capacity of the system is required to be filled...|$|R

The system considered in this study consists of the large-scale ASIRS with <b>stacker</b> <b>cranes,</b> the loopedtrack AGV system, aisle conveyors connecting these two systems, and incoming and outgoing conveyors. There are two major stages to model large-scale ASIRS-AGV systems efficiently and to execute simulation experiments.

40|$|Many full {{truckload}} pick-up and delivery {{problems in the}} intermodal freight container transport industry can be modeled as Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problems (ATSPs). Several authors have noted that while ATSPs are NP-hard, some instances are readily solved to optimality in only {{a short amount of}} time. Furthermore, the literature contains several references to the <b>Stacker</b> <b>Crane</b> Problem (SCP) as an “easy” problem amidst the ATSPs. We put this hypothesis to test by using statistical methods to build a model relating measurable distance matrix structures to the amount of time required by two existing exact solvers in finding solutions to over 500 ATSP instances. From this analysis we conclude that SCPs are not necessarily easier than other ATSPs, but a special subset of SCPs, termed drayage problems, are more readily solved. We speculate that drayage problems are “easy” because of a comparatively high number of zeros in symmetric locations within the distance matrix. In real-world drayage problems (i. e. the movement of containers a short distance to/from a port or rail terminal), these zeros correspond to the prevalence of jobs originating at or destined to a fixed number of freight terminals.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for {{reducing}} the computational cost of motion planning of warehouse equipped with two stacker cranes (Fig. 1). There is a former research studied the motion planning of an automated storage/retrieval system with two independent stacker cranes [1]. While the loading efficiency of the algorithm it proposed is satisfied, calculating the feasible trajectory requires {{a significant amount of}} time, which does not satisfy the requirement of industry. In other words, the load to be transported is assigned randomly, so we cannot do trajectory calculation beforehand. We propose {{a method for}} reducing the computational time of motion planning for stacker cranes [2]. Most automated storage/retrieval systems are only equipped with one <b>stacker</b> <b>crane.</b> However, this is logistically challenging, and higher work efficiency in warehouses, such as those using two stacker cranes, is required. In this paper, a warehouse with two stacker cranes working simultaneously is proposed. Unlike warehouses with only one crane, trajectory planning in those with two cranes is very difficult. Since there are two cranes working together, a proper trajectory must be considered to avoid collision.

To improve {{the efficiency of the}} solution methods, a novel simplification of the model is presented, which has a low impact {{on the quality of the}} solution but greatly decreases its complexity. This model is then used to benchmark several popular solution methods, including both optimal and approximate methods. Some are based on monolithic models, whereas others solve the problem in phases by using sub-problem formulations. The result presented in this paper shows that evaluated solution methods have complementary strengths and weaknesses. Constraint Programming (CP) is very efficient on small scale problems, while Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) scales much better when the number of movement orders increases. However, none of these methods are able to solve large instances of the problem to optimality. To handle the complexity of the problem, approximate solution methods are the only viable option. In this paper we show that promising results can be obtained even with simple methods using well known search algorithms such as A* and Tabu-search.

40|$|We propose control {{methodology}} of two <b>stacker</b> <b>cranes</b> to avoid collisions in an automated storage/retrieval system including the constraint on trajectories caused by dynamics {{as shown in}} Fig. 1. In the automated storage/retrieval system environment, there are three problems: constraint on trajectories caused by dynamics (e. g., vibration control), safety {{in the case of}} an emergency stop, and practical calculation time. In the proposed method, the motion is planned through two approaches. In the first approach, the trajectories of cranes are chosen from candidates that satisfy the constraint on dynamics and are checked to determine whether the selected trajectory ensures safety in case of an emergency. The calculation cost is reduced by confining the candidate trajectories using the characteristic of the number of cranes. If a collision cannot be avoided in the first approach, we adjust the confined candidate trajectories and find a suboptimal trajectory. The techniques used in the second approach are to delay the movement of cranes and to generate detours. Concretely, we set a via point on the line which is normal to the line between the current position of a crane and the collision point on the original trajectory, and the line is set to pass the collision point (Fig. 2). In the simulation, the working efficiency of the evaluated method is calculated as the ratio of the work time of a single crane to that of the method. The simulation results are shown in Table 1. The working efficiency is 1. 98 when collision is ignored, 1. 68 in a simple method, and 1. 85 in the proposed method. If collision is ignored, the working efficiency is almost doubled compared to the case of a single crane. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} {{high bay}} warehouse {{is commonly used}} for storing large number of material with a high throughput. In an automated warehouse pallet movements are mainly performed {{by a number of}} automated devices like conveyors systems, trolleys, and <b>stacker</b> <b>cranes.</b> From the introduction of the material to the automated warehouse system to its dispatch the system requires no operator input or intervention since all material movements are done automatically. This allows the automated warehouse to operate continuously with minimal manpower. The thesis focuses on a conveyor system within an automated warehouse. The conveyor system is responsible for the intake of material into the warehouse, internal use of material in the production, and dispatch of finished products. The material is stored on pallets, which are used to transport the material over different types of conveyors. The main contribution of the thesis is a software written for a programmable logic controller, which allows an arbitrary configuration of a conveyor system. The software is modular and consists of several so-called function blocks, where each function block represents the whole program logic for a single conveyor and uses a standard interface for information exchange with other function blocks. The software currently supports eight different types of conveyors, which can be freely linked with one another to create a conveyor system, of any size and complexity. The software allows for simple extension of existing project, and rapid development of new projects. To add a new type of conveyor only we need to create a new function block, which is following the now established standards for information exchange and supports all functionalities of the new conveyor type. The software is used on the conveyor system which consists of one hundred forty units. The software has proved to be reliable, since it has been operating without problems for more than one year. ...|$|R
