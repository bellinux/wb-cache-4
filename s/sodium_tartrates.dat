The effects of <b>sodium</b> <b>tartrate</b> concentration, reaction temperature, and stirring speed on the precipitation were investigated comprehensively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray powder diffraction methods were used to characterize the carbonate precipitate products. <b>Sodium</b> <b>tartrate</b> concentration, reaction temperature, and stirring speed have significant effects on the morphology of the carbonate products. <b>Sodium</b> <b>tartrate</b> has an inhibitive effect on the precipitation. The product weight decreases {{with the increase in}} the amount of <b>sodium</b> <b>tartrate</b> added, and with the increase in reaction temperature, but is almost irrelevant to the stirring speed. The products obtained at 25 and 50 o C were all identified as nesquehonite. The experimental results show that the use of an additive would be an effective method to adjust the morphology of magnesium carbonate...|$|R

A conventional sonication bath (37 kHz) was used for the sonochemical synthesis. This work focuses on the reaction temperature effect and the effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>tartrate</b> concentration. It was confirmed that particle size, and particle morphology is dependent of these two reaction parameters.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston University, 1940 The {{author has}} {{reported}} in a previous paper, {{the results of an}} investigation of the United States Pharmacopoeia XI method for the assay of Rochelle salt. In this investigation, it was found that all samples of Rochelle salt bought on the market, were below standard requirement by the official method, were below standard requirement when assayed by the official method. The United States Pharmacopocia XI requires that Rochelle salt contain no less that 99 percent of KNaC 4 H 6 O 6. 4 H 2 O. The results obtained indicated that the samples assayed were close to 90 percent. To account for this discrepancy the following possibilites were considered as probable explanations; (1) the official method gives erroneous results, (2) the samples were not of standard quality, and (3) the requirements were too high. Since the samples assayed were from large chemical companies, and all of them gave the same result, it was assumed that these samples were very likely representative of the Rochelle salt available, and would be of standard quality. References were fiven to the literature where it is reported {{that it is difficult to}} obtain pure crystals of potassium and <b>sodium</b> <b>tartrate.</b> When the salt is crystallized by the usual method, it was found the product obtained was a mixture of potassium and <b>sodium</b> <b>tartrate,</b> potassium <b>tartrate</b> and <b>sodium</b> <b>tartrate...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>tartrate</b> {{concentrations}} on morphology {{and characteristics of}} anodic oxide film on titanium alloy was investigated. The alloy substrates were anodized in different concentration solutions of <b>sodium</b> <b>tartrate</b> {{with the addition of}} PTFE emulsion and their morphology and characteristics were analyzed. The anodic oxide film presented a uniform petaloid drums and micro-cracks morphology. Additionally, micro-cracks dramatically swelled with the increase of the tartrate concentrations. The thickness of the anodic oxide film increased with the concentrations until the concentration reached 15 g/L. The results of Raman analysis illustrate that all samples have similarity in the crystal structure, consisting of mainly amorphous TiO 2, some anatase TiO 2 and a small amount of rutile TiO 2. And the ratios of anatase TiO 2 and rutile TiO 2 increase with the concentrations until it reaches 15 g/L. Furthermore, the intensity of the peaks increases with enhanced concentrations until the concentration reaches 15 g/L. The corrosion resistance of the anodic oxide film is increased by the <b>sodium</b> <b>tartrate</b> with higher concentrations before 15 g/L. The coefficient of friction of the anodic oxide film reduces with the concentrations until the concentration reaches 15 g/L, then the coefficient of friction of the anodic oxide film increases with the concentrations...|$|R

Cytotoxicity experiments indicated that the hierarchically nanostructured HA had good biocompatibility. It was shown by in-vitro experiments that mesenchymal stem cells could attach to the hierarchically nanostructured HA after being cultured for 48 hours. Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop facile and effective methods for the synthesis of novel hydroxyapatite (HA) with hierarchical nanostructures assembled from independent and discrete nanobuilding blocks. Methods: A simple hydrothermal approach was applied to synthesize HA by using CaCl 2, NaH 2 PO 4, and potassium <b>sodium</b> <b>tartrate</b> at 200 &deg;C for 24 hours. The cell cytotoxicity of the hierarchically nanostructured HA was tested by MTT (3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Results: HA displayed the flower-like structure assembled from nanosheets consisting of nanorod building blocks. The potassium <b>sodium</b> <b>tartrate</b> was used as a chelating ligand, inducing the formation and self-assembly of HA nanorods. The heating time and heating temperature influenced the aggregation and morphology of HA. The cell viability did not decrease with the increasing concentration of hierarchically nanostructured HA added. Conclusion: A novel, simple and reliable hydrothermal route had been developed for the synthesis of hierarchically nanosized HA with flower-like structure assembled from nanosheets consisting of nanorod building blocks. The HA with the hierarchical nanostructure was formed via a soft-template assisted self-assembly mechanism.

For Ga–Se complexed with trisodium citrate, below the pH of 5, the Se percentage was dominated, and at high pH of 13.5, Ga was dominant. They were able to co-deposit Ga–Se films within the pH window of 7 – 8.5 [61]. The same group could co-deposit Cu–In–Ga alloy at alkaline conditions (9 – 13.5) using blends of complexing agents for solubilizing and preventing hydroxide formation of ions at such high alkaline conditions.
