5|$|However, {{even among}} Senate Republicans, there were {{conflicting}} views. <b>Senators</b> <b>Arlen</b> Specter and Lindsey Graham (the latter a former military prosecutor) indicated Congress would work quickly to authorize tribunals, while influential Senator John Warner suggested a cautious and deliberative response. The potential for Congressional action also provided an avenue for politicking, as Republicans threatened Democratic members of Congress with being labeled weak on terrorism {{if they did}} not authorize tribunals.|$|R
50|$|On April 22, 1987, the Federal Bureau of Prisons {{announced}} that a $40 million medium-security federal prison housing 500 to 600 inmates would be built in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The project was expected to create 250 new prison jobs and an estimated 144 non-prison jobs. Various politicians, including US <b>Senators</b> <b>Arlen</b> Specter and John Heinz, and economic development {{groups such as the}} Schuylkill Economic Development Corporation, had lobbied vigorously for the project for three years.|$|R
25|$|Two women, Angela Wright and Rose Jourdain, made {{statements}} to Senate staffers {{in support of}} Hill. Ultimately, however, Wright and Jourdain were dismissed by the Judiciary Committee without testifying. The reasons why Wright was not called (or chose not to be called) to testify are complex and {{a matter of some}} dispute; Republican Senators wanted to avoid the prospect of a second woman describing inappropriate behavior by Thomas, while Democratic Senators were concerned about Wright's credibility and Wright herself was reluctant to testify after seeing the Committee's treatment of Hill, including Pennsylvania <b>Senator</b> <b>Arlen</b> Specter stating that he felt Hill's testimony was perjurious in its entirety. During the Thomas nomination proceedings, Wright and Hill were the only people who publicly alleged that then-Judge Thomas had made unsolicited sexual advances, and Hill {{was the only one who}} testified to that effect.|$|E
25|$|On March 19, Obama {{became the}} first sitting {{president}} to appear on a late night talk show {{when he was a}} guest on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. On April 2, Obama attended the G-20 London Summit.

On April 28, day 99 of Obama's presidency, <b>Senator</b> <b>Arlen</b> Specter (a former Democrat who switched to the Republican party in 1966) returned to the Democratic Party. Specter increased the Democratic senators to 59, one short of a filibuster-proof majority. At the conclusion of the first 100 days, over 100 federal judgeships remained vacant.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, while {{testifying before}} <b>Senator</b> <b>Arlen</b> Specter and the Senate Judiciary Committee about Mack, Pequot Capital and the SEC lack of oversight, {{he warned that}} SEC {{enforcement}} was dangerously lax. He said that the SEC had recovered a mere $110,000 from hedge fund insider trading over one year when the Committee itself had found evidence that over a one-year period, more than 41% of all mergers and acquisitions of over a billion dollars involved insider trading. Aguirre warned that lack of effective oversight of rampant corruption was allowing Wall Street the same unregulated market abuse and leveraging that caused the Wall Street crash of 1929. In 2008, he delivered a similar message at the Sibos conference in Vienna. Just prior {{to the collapse of}} Bear Stearns, he {{wrote a letter to the}} Senate Banking Committee that the nation's banks, and particularly Bear Stearns, were at risk because of subprime debt exposure and credit default swaps. In September 2008, during the debate on the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), Aguirre's projections on the costs of the taxpayer bailout were cited on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E
25|$|In May 2007, a new Federal law {{went into}} effect making interstate dog {{fighting}} activities felonious and providing for imprisonment and imposition of large fines. The Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act, a new Federal law sponsored by US <b>Senators</b> <b>Arlen</b> Specter (D-PA.), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA.), and John Ensign (R-NV.), was enacted by the U.S. Congress earlier in 2007 and signed by President George W. Bush on May 3, making organizing a dog fight a felony. The law provides a penalty of {{up to three years}} of imprisonment and up to a $250,000 fine for each offense of interstate or foreign transport of animals for fighting purposes. Using the provisions of the new law, which took effect immediately, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is pursuing cases in a number of locations around the country with considerable support from humane societies and local police departments.|$|R
5000|$|The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights {{investigated}} the Bluebonnet deal in 1990 to determine, among other questions, why Fail's bid succeeded despite the 1976 fraud conviction of his company, {{which should have}} been a [...] "presumptive disqualifier" [...] per FHLBB regulations. Initially most of the criticism came from chairman Howard Metzenbaum, who described the deal as [...] "an abomination, the worst case we have found" [...] among the savings and loan bailouts.When Fail admitted to incorrect disclosures of his legal history, <b>Senators</b> <b>Arlen</b> Specter and Orrin Hatch also voiced their concerns. Author Marin Lowy, in his 1991 analysis of the situation, describes the hearings as exaggerated and [...] "political hay". At the same time, Lowy expresses doubt towards Fail's [...] "business morals" [...] and trustworthiness with federal aid, concluding that thanks to the public scrutiny, [...] "there's little likelihood that Mr. Fail can or will loot Bluebonnet", and in this sense the public good had ultimately been served.|$|R
5000|$|Boies Penrose (November 1, 1860 [...] - [...] December 31, 1921) was an American {{lawyer and}} Republican {{politician}} from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He represented Pennsylvania in the United States Senate from 1897 {{until his death}} in 1921. Penrose was the fourth boss of the Pennsylvania Republican machine, following Simon Cameron, Donald Cameron, and Matthew Quay. Penrose was the longest-serving Pennsylvania <b>Senator</b> until <b>Arlen</b> Specter surpassed his record in 2005.|$|R

The collection will be jointly managed by the University of Pittsburgh, which will house, organize, and manage the collection. The universities will collaborate on related education programing that will consequently provide access to the archives on both ends of the state. [...] The Specter Collection will also support The Arlen Specter Center for Public Policy at Philadelphia University.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} months of the Obama administration, Biden assumed the role of an {{important}} behind-the-scenes counselor. [...] One role was to adjudicate disputes between Obama's [...] "team of rivals". [...] The president compared Biden's efforts to a basketball player [...] "who does a bunch of things that don't show up in the stat sheet." [...] Biden {{played a key role in}} gaining Senate support for several major pieces of Obama legislation, and was a main factor in convincing <b>Senator</b> <b>Arlen</b> Specter to switch from the Republican to the Democratic party. [...] Biden lost an internal debate to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton regarding his opposition to sending 21,000 new troops to the war in Afghanistan. [...] His skeptical voice was still considered valuable within the administration, however, and later in 2009 Biden's views achieved more prominence within the White House as Obama reconsidered his Afghanistan strategy.|$|E
500|$|Congressional {{committee}} members {{stated that the}} blend of genuine information and disinformation altered American perceptions of the USSR and possibly affected billions of dollars' worth of military acquisition decisions. Congress pointed to the multibillion-dollar F-22 fighter project as a possible result of inflated estimates on the USSR. Committee members charged that the CIA never warned the recipients of the suspicious intelligence because it sought to protect dubious sources; they cited {{a case in which}} a CIA officer forwarded 16 reports without mentioning that they were derived from a confirmed Soviet agent. In another case, questioned sources provided documents on a new Soviet anti-aircraft missile indicating it had a new capability, prompting costly American spending on aircraft radar. <b>Senator</b> <b>Arlen</b> Specter (R-Pa.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called the revelation [...] "mind-boggling" [...] and sought a hearing with Webster, Gates, and Woolsey. However, Representative Larry Combest (R-Tex.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, stressed that [...] "nothing has been proven" [...] and that the intelligence may not have been wholly spurious. Intelligence officials countered that Specter's claims of the reports' damage were exaggerated, saying that development and acquisition decisions would never be based solely on agent reporting.|$|E
50|$|In July 2008, Bissoon was {{selected}} {{to serve as a}} United States Magistrate Judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, replacing Judge Francis X. Caiazza. She joined the bench on August 1, 2008, and is the first woman of color to sit on the federal bench in Pittsburgh. Bissoon, who is Hispanic and Indian, is also the first woman of Indian descent to sit on a federal court in the United States. During the 111th Congress, Pennsylvania <b>Senators</b> <b>Arlen</b> Specter and Bob Casey recommended Bissoon for a seat on the Western District of Pennsylvania. On November 17, 2010, President Barack Obama formally nominated Bissoon to be a United States district court judge, to replace Thomas Hardiman, who was elevated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in March 2007. On October 17, 2011, the Senate voted 82-3 to confirm Bissoon. She received her commission on October 19, 2011. With her appointment, Judge Bissoon became the first Hispanic female Article III judge in Pennsylvania and the first Asian American Article III judge in Pennsylvania.|$|R
50|$|William R. Lloyd, Jr. (born October 30, 1947) is the Small Business Advocate for the State of Pennsylvania. He was {{a member}} of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He was the Democratic nominee for U.S. <b>Senator</b> against {{incumbent}} <b>Arlen</b> Specter in 1998.|$|R
500|$|As {{early as}} 2008, the five-term Republican Pennsylvania <b>Senator</b> <b>Arlen</b> Specter made clear {{his plans to}} seek re-election. Specter had {{narrowly}} avoided a primary defeat against conservative challenger Pat Toomey during his 2004 Senate race, and {{he was expected to}} face an even greater challenge from Toomey in 2010, particularly since the conservative faction of the Pennsylvania Republican Party had vowed to defeat Specter in the upcoming primary. Some high-profile Democrats, including Vice President Joe Biden and Governor Rendell, began encouraging Specter to join the Democratic Party by publicly offering to help Specter raise money if he switched. A March 2009 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll found Specter trailing Toomey 41 percent to 27 percent among Republican primary voters, in large part due to voter angst over Specter's support for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was supported by President Obama. Since the Pennsylvania primaries are closed, the poll noted that Specter could not be assisted by support from moderates or Democrats. Clay F. Richards, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, said of the poll results, [...] "Pennsylvania Republicans are so unhappy with Sen. Specter’s vote for President Barack Obama's Stimulus Package and so-called pork barrel spending that they are voting for a former Congressman they hardly know." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} legal {{scholars}} and Congressional members—including <b>Senator</b> <b>Arlen</b> Specter, {{who was a}} Republican and the Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee—previously criticized the habeas provision of the Act as violating a clause of the Constitution that says the right to challenge detention [...] "shall not be suspended" [...] except in cases of [...] "rebellion or invasion".|$|E
2500|$|When <b>Senator</b> <b>Arlen</b> Specter of Pennsylvania {{left the}} GOP {{to join the}} Democratic Party on April 28, 2009, Sessions was {{selected}} to be the Ranking Member on the Senate Judiciary Committee. At that time, Specter said that his vote against Sessions's nomination was a mistake, because he had [...] "since found that Sen. Sessions is egalitarian".|$|E
2500|$|<b>Senator</b> <b>Arlen</b> Specter {{said the}} Court should [...] "decide more cases". On the other hand, {{although}} Justice Scalia acknowledged in a 2009 {{interview that the}} number of cases that the Court hears now is smaller today than when he first joined the Supreme Court, he also stated that he has not changed his standards for deciding whether to review a case, nor does he believe his colleagues have changed their standards. He attributed the high volume of cases in the late 1980s, at least in part, to an earlier flurry of new federal legislation that was making its way through the courts.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{politicians}} {{urged the}} league {{to seek a}} resolution to conflict. In December, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry {{wrote a letter to}} NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell asking for the league to settle their differences in time for the Patriots-Giants game. Because the game, as it turned out, would be the Patriots' attempt to seal the record that would make them the first undefeated team in 35 years, Kerry urged for a solution to be decided upon in time so that Americans can witness [...] "an historic event." [...] Also, Pennsylvania <b>Senator</b> <b>Arlen</b> Specter threatened to introduce legislation to eliminate the league's freedom from antitrust laws.|$|E
2500|$|There was {{national}} {{debate about the}} issue of releasing the victim's name, and United States <b>Senator</b> <b>Arlen</b> Specter of Pennsylvania held subcommittee hearings on the issue of televised trials after the conclusion of this case. Supporters of broadcasting criminal trials felt that newscasters should have used their editing capacity to delete Araujo's name. As noted by Peter Kaplan, Specter said, [...] "Some hard thinking has to be done in protecting the rights of witnesses and defendants." [...] He added, [...] "If this could be achieved, it would be highly desirable to televise rape cases, child-abuse cases and other crimes." [...] Other supporters also believed {{that it was important to}} show the judicial process.|$|E
2500|$|On November 21, 1997, President Bill Clinton {{had signed}} S. 923, special {{legislation}} introduced by <b>Senator</b> <b>Arlen</b> Specter to bar McVeigh and other veterans convicted of capital crimes from being buried in any military cemetery. His body was cremated at Mattox Ryan Funeral Home in Terre Haute. His ashes {{were given to}} his lawyer, who [...] "said that the final destination of McVeigh's remains would remain privileged forever." [...] McVeigh had written that he considered having them dropped {{at the site of}} the memorial where the building once stood, but decided that would be [...] "too vengeful, too raw, too cold." [...] He had expressed willingness to donate organs, but was prohibited from doing so by prison regulations.|$|E
