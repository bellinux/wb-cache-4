40|$|Collisionless stellar {{systems are}} driven towards {{equilibrium}} by mixing of phase-space elements. I {{show that the}} excess-mass function D(f) = int_{F(x,v) >f} (F(x,v) -f) d^ 3 x d^ 3 v (with F(x,v) the coarse-grained distribution function) always decreases on mixing. D(f) gives the excess mass from values of F(x,v)) >f. This novel form of the mixing theorem extends the maximum phase-space density argument to all values of f. The excess-mass function can be computed from N-body simulations and is additive: the excess mass {{of a combination of}} non-overlapping systems is the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> their individual <b>D(f).</b> I propose a novel interpretation for the coarse-grained distribution function, which avoids conceptual problems with the mixing theorem. As an example application, I show that for self-gravitating cusps (rho propto r^{-gamma} as r-> 0) the excess mass D propto f^{- 2 (3 -gamma) /(6 -gamma) } as f->oo, i. e. steeper cusps are less mixed than shallower ones, independent of the shape of surfaces of constant density or details of the distribution function (e. g. anisotropy). This property, together with the additivity <b>of</b> <b>D(f)</b> and the mixing theorem, implies that a merger remnant cannot have a cusp steeper than the steepest of its progenitors. Furthermore, I argue that the remnant's cusp should not be shallower either, implying that the steepest cusp always survives.

Globally, DF incidence has increased by 30 -fold over the last fifty years, and the geographic range of the virus and its vectors has expanded. The disease is now endemic in more than 120 countries in tropical and subtropical parts of the world. This study examines the spatiotemporal trends <b>of</b> <b>DF</b> transmission in the Asia-Pacific region over a 50 -year period, and identified the disease's cluster areas. METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: The World Health Organization's DengueNet provided the annual number <b>of</b> <b>DF</b> cases in 16 countries in the Asia-Pacific region for the period 1955 to 2004. This fifty-year dataset was divided into five ten-year periods {{as the basis for}} the investigation <b>of</b> <b>DF</b> transmission trends. Space-time cluster analyses were conducted using scan statistics to detect the disease clusters. This study shows an increasing trend in the spatiotemporal distribution <b>of</b> <b>DF</b> in the Asia-Pacific region over the study period.

40|$|Dengue fever (DF) is {{a serious}} public health concern {{in many parts of}} the world. An {{increase}} in DF incidence has been observed globally over the past decades. Multiple factors including urbanisation, increased international travels and global climate change are thought to be responsible for increased DF. However, little research has been conducted in the Asia-Pacific region about the impact of these changes on dengue transmission. The overarching aim of this thesis is to explore the spatiotemporal pattern <b>of</b> <b>DF</b> transmission in the Asia-Pacific region and project the future risk <b>of</b> <b>DF</b> attributable to climate change. Annual data <b>of</b> <b>DF</b> outbreaks for sixteen countries in the Asia-Pacific region over the last fifty years were used in this study. The results show that the geographic range <b>of</b> <b>DF</b> in this region increased significantly over the study period. Thailand, Vietnam and Laos were identified as the highest risk areas and there was a southward expansion observed in the transmission pattern <b>of</b> <b>DF</b> which might have originated from Philippines or Thailand. Additionally, the detailed DF data were obtained and the space-time clustering <b>of</b> <b>DF</b> transmission was examined in Bangladesh. Monthly DF data were used for the entire country at the district level during 2000 - 2009. Dhaka district was identified as the most likely DF cluster in Bangladesh and several districts of the southern part of Bangladesh were identified as secondary clusters in the years 2000 - 2002. In order to examine the association between meteorological factors and DF transmission and to project the future risk <b>of</b> <b>DF</b> using different climate change scenarios, the climate-DF relationship was examined in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The results show that climate variability (particularly maximum temperature and relative humidity) was positively associated with DF transmission in Dhaka. The effects of climate variability were observed at a lag of four months which might help to potentially control and prevent DF outbreaks through effective vector management and community education. Based on the quantitative assessment of the climate-DF relationship, projected climate change will likely increase mosquito abundance and activity and DF in this area. Assuming a temperature increase of 3. 3 oC without any adaptation measures and significant changes in socio-economic conditions, the consequence will be devastating, with a projected annual increase of 16, 030 cases in Dhaka, Bangladesh by the end of this century. Therefore, public health authorities need to be prepared for likely increase <b>of</b> <b>DF</b> transmission in this region. This study adds to the literature on the recent trends <b>of</b> <b>DF</b> and impacts <b>of</b> climate change on DF transmission.
