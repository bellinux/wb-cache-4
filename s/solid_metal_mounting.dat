Its range was 25-35 km with an accuracy of ±10-20 meters, azimuth 0.1 degrees, and elevation ±0.3-0.5 degrees. Only 51 units were produced before being superseded by the ‘Mannheim’.|$|R

The tailpiece {{consists of a}} <b>solid</b> block of <b>metal,</b> <b>mounted</b> behind the [...] "tremolo plate" [...] and secured to it by three machine screws, and passing right through the guitar body. In a chamber routed {{into the back of}} the guitar are up to five (normally three) long coil springs, which connect to the back of the tailpiece block, and whose tension balances that of the strings.|$|R
50|$|Alloying of the <b>solid</b> <b>metal</b> alters its LME. Some {{alloying}} elements {{may increase the}} severity while others may prevent LME. The action of the alloying element {{is known to be}} segregation to grain boundaries of the <b>solid</b> <b>metal</b> and alteration of the grain boundary properties. Accordingly, maximum LME is seen in cases where alloy additions elements have saturated the grain boundaries of the <b>solid</b> <b>metal.</b> The hardness and deformation behaviour of the <b>solid</b> <b>metal</b> affect its susceptibility to LME. Generally, harder metals are more severely embrittled. Grain size greatly influences LME. Solids with larger grains are more severely embrittled and the fracture stress varies inversely with the square root of grain diameter. Also the brittle to ductile transition temperature is increased by increasing grain size.|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} {{were conducted to}} determine the <b>solid</b> <b>metal</b> nucleation pathways of radiatively cooling, molten zirconium spheres of two different commercially available purity grades in a high-vacuum, high-temperature electrostatic levitator. The ensemble distribution of maximum undercooling temperatures was interpreted using Poisson statistics to determine the temperature dependence of the <b>solid</b> <b>metal</b> nucleation rate. For a sample of nominally 99. 95 % pure zirconium, the {{results are consistent with}} heterogeneous <b>solid</b> <b>metal</b> nucleation either on static catalyst particles at least ~ 30 nm diameter or on a surface coating. For a sample of nominally 99 % pure zirconium, however, it appears that heterogeneous <b>solid</b> <b>metal</b> nucleation occurred either on a polydispersion of ~ 10 nm (mean diameter) static catalyst particles or on dynamic catalyst particles which precipitated from a solution which became supersaturated as the melt cooled. A quantitative analysis of the compositions of both samples suggests that the catalysts probably consisted of {{one or more of the}} following elements: niobium, molybdenum, hafnium, and oxygen...|$|R

50|$|External {{parameters}} like temperature, strain rate, {{stress and}} time {{of exposure to the}} liquid metal prior to testing affect LME. Temperature produces a ductility trough and a ductile to brittle transition behaviour in the <b>solid</b> <b>metal.</b> The temperature range of the trough as well as the transition temperature are altered by the composition of the liquid and <b>solid</b> <b>metals,</b> the structure of the <b>solid</b> <b>metal</b> and other experimental parameters. The lower limit of the ductility trough generally coincides with the melting point of the liquid metal. The upper limit is strain rate sensitive. Temperature also affects the kinetics of LME.An increase in strain rate increases the upper limit temperature as well as the crack propagation rate. In most metal couples LME does not occur below a threshold stress level.|$|R
