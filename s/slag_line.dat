40|$|Sintered and fused {{magnesia}} (MgO) are primary ingredients of MgO-C and Mag-Chrome bricks used for steel processing furnaces, for example BOF, EAF, and ladles. Magnesia clinker exhibits brilliant blue or red CL colors in these bricks. The blue CL color is generally interpreted {{to be produced}} by lattice defects or intrinsic properties of MgO crystal. The red CL color is related to impurity centers. Cr 3 +, Fe 3 +, and Mn 4 + activators are known to produce red CL color in MgO. Red to blue or blue to red CL color changes in MgO clinkers in MgO-C refractories from <b>slag</b> <b>line</b> of ladle or BOF, in fact, represent changes in local atmosphere within the refractory brick. In a reducing surrounding local CO atmosphere (in {{the center of the}} brick), the valence state of these transition metal ions are easily reduced and the blue CL is enhanced. Similarly, in an oxidized environment where free O 2 and CO 2 are predominant gaseous species, MgO grains in MgO-C and Mag-Chrome brick generally produce red CL color.

In support of the lead–bismuth coolant feasibility, the main advantages and specific features of its application are presented, taking into account significant experience acquired in Russia in handling this coolant (nuclear submarines reactor units and circulation loops), availability of job-proved methods and equipment for the coolant quality control, coolant properties ensuring fire and explosion safety and heat removal capability under high temperature and low pressure conditions. Preliminary calculated estimates were made as for temperature distributions during lead–bismuth cooling of the melting unit steel vessel.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this 24 month project {{is to determine the}} degree of sulfur retention in slag in a full scale cyclone coal combustor with sulfur capture by calcium oxide sorbent injection into the combustor. This sulfur capture process consists of two steps: Capture of sulfur with calcined calcium oxide followed by impact of the reacted sulfur-calcium particles on the liquid <b>slag</b> <b>lining</b> the combustor. The sulfur bearing slag must be removed within several minutes from the combustor to prevent re-evolution of the sulfur from the slag. To accomplish this requires slag mass flow rates in the range of several 100 lb/hr. To study this two step process in the combustor, two groups of tests are being implemented. In the first group, calcium sulfate in the form of gypsum, or plaster of Paris, was injected in the combustor to determine sulfur evolution from slag. In the second group, the entire process is tested with limestone and/or calcium hydrate injected into the combustor. This entire effort consists of a series of up to 16 parametric tests in a 20 MMtu/hr slagging, air cooled, cyclone combustor.

40|$|Continuous {{temperature}} measurement of molten steel in new {{as well as}} existing steelmaking processes is not always feasible with current technology. However, it is a well known fact that molten steel temperature, especially during the continuous casting operation, can {{have a profound effect}} on the quality of the product. A knowledge of the instantaneous steel temperature in the tundish can serve as a valuable tool in the quest for better quality. With the implementation of statistical process control techniques such occurrences as breakouts, tundish freeze up or the nucleation of an extensive area of columnar grains in the cast section can be reduced. However, conventional thermocouples cannot withstand the severe corrosion around the <b>slag</b> <b>line</b> for a sustained period of time. Even though the sensing wires that comprise the hot junction can, if well protected, be used for long periods of time without serious deterioration, a suitable refractory cover or sleeve must be applied to the thermocouple prior to using it. For the present work, two methods for continuously measuring melt temperature were developed. One of these relies on deducing melt temperature while the other is based on providing a cooled sleeve for the thermocouple to minimize <b>slag</b> <b>line</b> corrosion. The first technique involves the use of multiple thermocouples embedded in a refractory section at various displacements. When the refractory is contacted by the melt, transient heat transfer is initiated through the section. By analyzing this transient behaviour with a suitable heat transfer model, it is possible to infer the temperature of the melt. A mathematical model that adequately describes this process has been developed and tested. An alternative approach that was developed uses heat pipe technology to prevent the corrosion of the thermocouple probe through solidification of slag onto the heat pipe which can serve as a protector of the probe. Heat pipes are devices capable of transferring large quantities of heat with very small temperature differences. Advantages of the heat pipe when used as a heat transmission device are constructional simplicity, flexibility, high heat transport capability, and no need for external pumping device. The heat pipe consists of a closed evacuated tube, porous wicking material, and working fluid. Heating one part of the external surface leads to evaporation of the working fluid and the establishment of a pressure gradient within the heat pipe. The resulting pressure difference drives the vapor from the evaporator to the condenser where the pressure and temperature are slightly lower. The effective conductance of the heat pipe can be several orders of magnitude higher than that of an equivalent solid copper bar. In the second part of this thesis, the feasibility of incorporating heat pipe technology to solidify and maintain a thin layer of slag on the heat pipe while it is in operation is presented...|$|E

40|$|Within {{ilmenite}} smelters, the slag is at {{a temperature}} just above its liquidus (because the furnace operates with a <b>slag</b> freeze <b>lining),</b> and the metal bath is at a temperature which is approximately 150 °C {{lower than the}} slag temperature.

Samples of the solidified layer were obtained from a DC ilmenite smelter which had cooled with its contents intact. Analysis showed parts of the layer to be close to anosovite (Ti 3 O 5) in composition; in all cases, the solid contained much less FeO than the primary pseudobrookite which forms during bulk slag solidification after tapping. Equilibrium calculations show that these compositions can result from reaction of initially FeO-rich pseudobrookite with dissolved carbon in the metal bath. The presence of this layer of near-anosovite material in the furnace has possible implications for settling of metal and for the furnace energy balance; the latter was explored with thermodynamic calculations.

40|$|Abstract – The use of {{water-cooled}} copper components as sidewall {{elements of}} submerged arc furnaces and other pyrometallurgical applications {{has become increasingly}} common. The high cooling efficiency of copper {{has made it possible}} to increase the service life of furnace refractories when compared to conventional refractory linings. However even the self-healing effect of ‘freezing ’ worn areas of the lining does not necessarily protect the copper coolers against wear or corrosion completely. In order to avoid furnace explosions, various methods have been used to monitor the wear of coolers. Unfortunately, these {{have not been able to}} consistently identify localized wear. Thos Begbie (South African) and SAVEWAY (German) jointly developed technology to embed a line sensor into the copper cooler during the casting process. This system allows an exhaustive monitoring of the copper cooler. A SAVELINE sensor is placed inside the copper-cooling panel between the water-cooling passage and the hot face of the panel. The sensor follows the meandering shape of the cooling water channels. In the first instance, the sensor provides analogue information as the thickness of the copper reduces. Secondly, this wear signal will be confirmed by a signal of interruption if the sensor is washed away. Because of the structure of the sensor, a self-diagnosis is possible and indications can be confirmed (double proofed). Subsequent to the manufacture of some test pieces, coolers for a large submerged arc furnace were manufactured. The sensorized coolers have been installed at the intermittent surface (<b>slag</b> <b>line)</b> where the largest amount of corrosion has been encountered. The system has been operating since December 2005 in what is considered one of the largest submerged arc furnaces in South Africa...|$|E
40|$|Ways of {{increasing}} productivity have been always a challenging issue for pyrometallurgical processes. Increasing the throughput of the reactor through higher temperature and vigorous agitation in bath are possible options for enhancing the kinetics of reactions in the multiphase system processes.

40|$|High matte {{temperatures}} can {{be related}} to numerous catastrophic furnace failures in the platinum group metal (PGM) industry where chromite-rich upper group 2 (UG 2) concentrates are smelted. Chromite rich concentrates require high slag temperatures as well as sufficient mixing to suspend the chromite spinel particles in the slag and prevent settling in a so-called "mushy" layer consisting of a three phase emulsion of slag, matte and chromite particles. To achieve sufficient bath mixing and to melt and suspend chromite spinel build-up, high hearth power densities are utilised. However, high hearth power densities in conjunction with a heat-isolating concentrate layer, leads to high side wall heat fluxes which motivated the use of intensive cooling in the furnace side wall so that a <b>slag</b> freeze <b>lining</b> can be formed. If matte temperatures are above the slag liquidus temperature, any matte that comes into contact with the freeze lining can destroy the freeze lining. Moreover, if the matte temperature exceeds ca. 1500 °C, chemical thermodynamics indicate that matte has the ability to sulfidise MgO-FexO-Cr 2 O 3 refractories, leading to rapid wear of refractories exposed to high temperature flowing matte. Models are derived for the concentrate-to-matte and slag-to-matte droplet heat transfer. Calculations using the derived models, physical properties and furnace operating conditions give realistic matte temperatures and show that matte temperatures rapidly increase as the concentrate bed becomes matte drainage rate limiting. It is shown that for each concentrate blend mean particle size and mineralogy, there is a maximum smelting rate above which the concentrate bed becomes rate limiting with regards matte drainage, thereby significantly contributing to matte preheating, prior to further heat absorption from the slag layer. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Pyrometallurgical processing currently offers the most attractive routes to perform the initial separation before the usual hydrometallurgical refining steps to produce high purity metals and compounds. There is a lack of information on the way valuable metals in WEEE behave during smelting because the combination of metals in WEEE is frequently different to that found in natural ores. In this first paper the slag/metal distribution ratio of tin between FeOx-CaO-SiO 2 slags and copper was examined at an oxygen partial pressure of 10 - 8 MPa (10 - 7 atm) and at 1300 C. The distribution ratio of tin was unaffected by the Fe/SiO 2 ratio of the slag, over the range examined, but strongly dependant on the CaO content.

40|$|Chemical {{degradation}} of a refractory lining is most commonly {{considered as a}} dissolution process whereby the refractory components dissolve into the liquid <b>slag.</b> Hence, the <b>lining</b> thickness is steadily reduced. The dissolution process is not merely limited to the slag-refractory contact surface, but due to capillary forces, also occurs inside the porous refractory brick. This paper describes how the interaction between slag and brick during infiltration, changes the slag composition {{as a function of}} infiltration depth. Knowledge about the selective filtering of certain slag components by a refractory brick is indispensible in predicting the chemical degradation, especially when significant changes in slag composition are present. In this case, often seen with non-ferrous slags, the situation in the interior of the brick cannot be adequately predicted based on the global slag and brick composition. To study this “filter effect”, a magnesia-chrome finger in contact with a PbO-SiO 2 -ZnO-Al 2 O 3 -CaO liquid slag at constant temperature is tested. Using SEM-EDS analyses the slag composition as a function of infiltration depth is measured. Based on the microstructure at different positions, the interactions leading to modified slag compositions are determined. They can be classified into two categories: (1) slag components that diffuse into the brick phases and (2) reaction between slag components and dissolved brick components forming new solid phases. Slow diffusion prevents the slag from reaching its equilibrium concentration before it infiltrates further in the brick. The slag composition, therefore, not merely depends on the occurring reactions but also on the relative diffusion rate in the refractory phases (compared to the slag infiltration rate). status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This {{study focused}} on the dynamic {{behaviour}} of the freeze <b>lining</b> and <b>slag</b> bath, and the interactions between these components in an ilmenite-smelting furnace process. The purpose of the work was {{to gain a better}} understanding of these issues and to ultimately contribute to an improved understanding of the ilmenite-smelting process in its entirety, and to future improvements in the design, operation and control of these processes. A mathematical model of the freeze lining and furnace sidewall was developed. This model was used in isolation for focused characterisation of the dynamic behaviour and interactions of the freeze <b>lining</b> and <b>slag</b> bath. The influences of net power input and slag composition were studied and various aspects of the freeze <b>lining</b> and <b>slag</b> bath were considered. These aspects included freeze lining thickness, temperature distribution through the freeze lining and furnace sidewall, composition distribution through the freeze <b>lining,</b> <b>slag</b> bath temperature and slag bath composition. The thermal response of thermocouples installed in the furnace sidewall to changing conditions on the inside of the furnace was also investigated. A mathematical model of the crust that forms on the slag bath surface was developed. This model was not used in isolation, and was only incorporated into a complete model of the process. A mathematical model of the entire ilmenite-smelting furnace process was constructed. This model incorporated the two models mentioned above and was able to describe the metal bath, slag bath, furnace atmosphere, freeze lining, furnace sidewall and the crust that is sometimes present on top of the slag bath. The model was used to study the influence of changes in operational parameters on the slag bath and freeze lining. The operational parameters that were studied included electrical power and reductant feed rate, both relative to ilmenite feed rate. The influence of severe operational errors and furnace down time were also investigated. Operational errors included loss of all feed while maintain electrical power input, and loss of reductant feed while maintaining power input and ilmenite feed. The above-mentioned studies were conducted by executing numerous experiments with two of the mathematical models. The experimental results were processed into sets of graphs displaying variations in the aspects that were considered. Many valuable insights resulted from the interpretation of these results. One specific aspect that formed part of the scope of this work was the origin of the compositional invariance of the slag close to the stoichiometric M 3 O 5 composition. This invariance was studied and a mechanism was proposed that explains the observed behaviour. The proposed mechanism created some questions about other mechanisms in the process. These mechanisms were also considered and elaborated on. The models and results produced in this study provide valuable insights into the behaviour of the ilmenite-smelting process. It also represents a useful foundation for future modelling work, and finally, it presents numerous opportunities for organisations operating ilmenite-smelting furnaces to improve their understanding and even the performance of their processes.

40|$|Low carbon {{ferrochrome}} is {{a primary}} alloying element {{in the production of}} stainless steel. The Mixing Method (Perrin and Duplex) processes are most commonly used for the production thereof. However, during the cocktailing step, process temperatures are extremely high, resulting in rapid deterioration of the ladle refractories and fuming of the products. The high temperature {{is a result of the}} exothermic silicothermic reduction reactions. A significant amount of energy is lost to the atmosphere. The Furnace Method, and in particular the Liquid Feed Furnace Method, has the potential to improve on the shortcomings of the Mixing Method. A techno-economic evaluation was performed on the different process routes to identify whether or not there is merit in choosing one over the other. The evaluation showed that the capital cost for the methods are comparable, but a saving in the operating cost is achievable when using the Furnace Method instead of the Mixing Method. Savings of 7. 3 to 7. 9 % were calculated for the Solid Feed Furnace Method and 9. 6 to 10. 7 % for the Liquid Feed Furnace Method, when compared to the Mixing Method. This is largely due to the lower energy requirement and raw material consumptions for the Furnace Method. The oxidising conditions in the Mixing Method ore-lime melt furnace, combined with a high slag basicity and high operating temperatures, are very conducive for producing hexavalent chromium, which is severely toxic to humans. Leaching tests, performed on a dust sample from an existing facility that uses the Perrin process, confirmed that a significant amount of Cr(VI) was produced. This poses a severe health and safety risk, as well as a financial burden to properly neutralise and dispose of any Cr(VI) that has formed. A closed furnace with little to no air ingress is used in the Furnace Method, thereby ensuring a more neutral atmosphere. A lower basicity slag, with a lower liquidus temperature is also used, thereby further decreasing the amount of Cr(VI) that would be likely to form. Having established that the Furnace Method has definite advantages over the Mixing Method, the preferred refractory-slag system was identified by means of thermochemical modelling. Different combinations of lime and doloma fluxed slag were modelled with magnesia and doloma refractories. Quartz fluxed slag in contact with an alumina lining was also considered to identify any unexpected benefits. The required slag liquidus temperature, to be compatible with low carbon ferrochrome alloy (which has a very high liquidus temperature), was determined to be between 1550 and 1700 ºC. Modelling showed that a quartz fluxed slag had a liquidus temperature well below this range for a very wide basicity range evaluated. Such a slag would therefore not be suitable. While a doloma fluxed slag had a liquidus temperature within this range, the slag basicity for that range would be very low and not be compatible with any of the two basic refractory systems evaluated. Doloma refractories were also found to suffer severe wear at an operating temperature of 1750 ºC, the temperature required to ensure that the alloy is molten. The required basicity range for a lime fluxed slag that had a liquidus temperature between 1550 and 1700 ºC was found to be 1. 68 to 1. 90. The slag only became saturated in MgO above a slag basicity of 1. 99. However, in a commercial-size furnace, the temperature at the refractory hot face would be lower than the process temperature, provided that the slag bath was not excessively turbulent. Sidewall cooling would also assist in maintaining a <b>slag</b> freeze <b>lining.</b> Operating with a slag basicity within the 1. 68 to 1. 90 range should therefore not pose a severe risk. As the process will be operated on a semi-batch basis, the variation of the slag and alloy composition throughout the heat could potentially result in a material that is not compatible with the refractory lining. Two scenarios were modelled, where FeSiCr was added to an ore-lime mixture, and vice versa. The first was found not to be detrimental to the refractories, but there is a concern regarding the high liquidus temperature of the ore-lime melt at the start of the heat. For the second scenario, magnesium was found to report to the gas and alloy phases at the start of the heat. This is of great concern as it would severely damage the refractory lining. To utilise as much of the exothermic energy as possible, while ensuring the integrity of the refractory lining, it was suggested to feed a portion of the ore-lime mixture first, followed by all of the FeSiCr before feeding the remainder of the ore-lime mixture. Feeding crushed, solid FeSiCr allows for better control. However, the latent heat and sensible heat of the FeSiCr would not be utilised. Smelting tests were performed with samples that had slag target basicities of 1. 5 and 2. 0 to investigate the phases that were formed and the severity of the slag-refractory interaction. The composition of the slag with a basicity of 1. 5 corresponded well with that predicted by the thermochemical model, while the slag composition for a target basicity of 2. 0 was very variable. This was due to the high solids content in the slag, which was operated close to its liquidus temperature. The slag CrO content was much lower and the alloy Cr content much higher for both tests, when compared to the values predicted by modelling. The extent to which the reduction reactions occurred was therefore higher than predicted by modelling. The reasons for this would have to be verified by analysing the mechanism by which the reactions occur. The complete dissolution of a refractory disc that was placed in the mixture for the test with a slag target basicity of 1. 5, along with slag penetration into the high density magnesia crucible, indicates that the 1. 5 basicity slag was not compatible with the magnesia. This is in agreement with the model. Although the refractory disc was still discernable for the test at a slag target basicity of 2. 0, it was severely worn. Slag penetration into the high density magnesia crucible was also evident. A freeze lining would therefore always be required. The Furnace Method can be considered as a suitable alternative to the Mixing Method. However, care should be taken to control the slag basicity in the region of 1. 70 and a freeze lining should be maintained to protect the refractories. The batch feed sequence is also critical to find a balance between having a liquid slag, while still retaining refractory integrity.
