50|$|Credit {{allows a}} {{borrower}} to increase today’s <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> {{at the expense}} <b>of</b> some future <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living.</b> Thus in financial terms, credit allows a consumer to spend {{a large amount of}} money today (raising their <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living)</b> while reducing their disposable income as the debt is repaid (lowering their future <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> relative to its potential). In environmental terms, credit {{can be thought of as}} raising today’s <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> through the consumption of finite resources (like oil).

5|$|Former World Bank Chief Economist {{and former}} Chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Joseph E. Stiglitz {{referred}} {{in the late}} 1990s to a growing consensus {{that something is wrong}} with a system having the capacity to impose high costs on a great {{number of people who are}} hardly even participants in international financial markets, neither speculating on international investments nor borrowing in foreign currencies. He argued that foreign crises have strong worldwide repercussions due in part to the phenomenon of moral hazard, particularly when many multinational firms deliberately invest in highly risky government bonds in anticipation of a national or international bailout. Although crises can be overcome by emergency financing, employing bailouts places a heavy burden on taxpayers living in the afflicted countries, and the high costs damage <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>living.</b> Stiglitz has advocated finding means of stabilizing short-term international capital flows without adversely affecting long-term foreign direct investment which usually carries new knowledge spillover and technological advancements into economies.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{conscription}} and {{the drive}} to increase productivity led to an increasing degree of industrial unrest over time. Many workers were required to work long hours in poor conditions and {{were not able to}} change their employment due to the manpower laws. Poor work conditions were exacerbated by the Government's austerity measures reducing workers' <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>living.</b> As a result, strikes and other forms of protest disrupted Australian production, especially from 1943 onwards. These protests attracted considerable criticism from other civilians and members of the military. In May 1943 the Government introduced policies which enabled workers who were undertaking unlawful industrial action to be conscripted into the military, but this had little impact due to the shortage of skilled labour in the industries most prone to industrial disputes.|$|E

40|$|The <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>of</b> {{an agent}} {{is viewed as}} her {{capability}} of achieving various functionings (Sen, 1985, 1987).

5|$|After World War II, {{the world}} {{split into two}} large geopolitical blocs, {{separating}} into spheres of communism and capitalism. This led to the Cold War, during which the term First World was often used because of its political, social, and economic relevance. The term itself was first introduced in the late 1940s by the United Nations. Today, the First World is slightly outdated and has no official definition, however, it is generally {{thought of as the}} capitalist, industrial, wealthy and developed countries. This definition includes Australia & New Zealand, the developed countries of Asia (South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore) and the wealthy countries of North America and Europe, particularly Western Europe. In contemporary society, the First World is viewed as countries that have the most advanced economies, the greatest influence, the highest <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>living,</b> and the greatest technology. After the Cold War, these countries of the First World included member states of NATO, U.S.-aligned states, neutral countries that were developed and industrialized, and the former British Colonies that were considered developed. It can be defined succinctly as Europe, plus the richer countries of the former British Empire (USA, Canada, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand), Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|Claims {{that the}} NEP had retarded {{economic}} growth were dismissed; it was posited that the NEP {{had managed to}} avert further racial rioting, which would have hurt economic growth more than the NEP. The NEP was also defended as having created a Malay middle class and improving <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> without compromising the non-Bumiputra share {{of the economy in}} absolute terms; statistics indicated that the Chinese and Indian middle classes also grew under the NEP, albeit not as much as the Malays'. The overall Malaysian poverty rate had shrunk from 50% at independence to 7%. It was also argued that ethnic stereotypes had been largely stamped out due to the NEP's success in creating a Malay upper class. Although many of the NEP's goals were restated by the NDP, the new policy appeared to be geared more towards wealth retention and creation, as opposed to simple redistribution. Nevertheless, many of the policies from the NEP era were retained under the NDP, which was set to expire in 2020.|$|E
5|$|In Essai, Cantillon {{provided}} an advanced version of John Locke's quantity theory of money, focusing on relative inflation and {{the velocity of}} money. Cantillon suggested that inflation occurs gradually and that the new supply of money has a localised effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of non-neutral money. Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of new money enjoy higher <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> {{at the expense of}} later recipients. The concept of relative inflation, or a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy, is now known as the Cantillon effect. Cantillon also considered changes in the velocity of money (quantity of exchanges made within a specific amount of time) influential on prices, although not to the same degree as changes in the quantity of money. While he believed that the money supply consisted only of specie, he conceded that increases in money substitutes—or bank notes—could affect prices by effectively increasing the velocity of circulating of deposited specie. Apart from distinguishing money from money substitute, he also distinguished between bank notes offered as receipts for specie deposits and bank notes circulating beyond the quantity of specie—or fiduciary media—suggesting that the volume of fiduciary media is strictly limited by people's confidence in its redeemability. He considered fiduciary media a useful tool to abate the downward pressure that hoarding of specie has on the velocity of money.|$|E

The theory part focuses on the World Health organisation whose strategic aims {{of health care and}} <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> are perceived holistically. The term <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> is defined as well as the term educator. It includes all teachers at all types of schools, carers and teacher assistants. The following parts of the thesis connect to these terms. These are fatigue, stress, depression, burnout syndrome, healthy psychic living and the meaning of life. The aim and the tasks together with the hypotheses are stated {{in the beginning of the}} research part.

5|$|Quarrington was a rural {{community}} {{during the early}} and middle Anglo-Saxon period while mills along the River Slea in the Middle Ages gave the village its alternative name of Millthorpe. The Bishop of Lincoln and Ramsey Abbey held manors in Quarrington after the Norman Conquest, but the Carre family of Sleaford were the principal land-owners between 1559 and 1683, when its estate passed by marriage to the Marquesses of Bristol. Although the growth of Victorian Sleaford saw the town encroach into the parish's boundaries, the old village remained a small cluster of farm buildings and cottages for much of its history. The sale {{of most of the}} surrounding farmland by successive Marquesses of Bristol in the late 20th century led to the rapid development of residential estates on Quarrington Hill and in New Quarrington which have engulfed the original settlement. Low crime rates, affordable housing, high <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> and access to good schools have attracted home-buyers to the area, contributing to a sharp rise in the population.|$|E
5|$|The left-wing {{uprising}} of 9 September 1944 led to {{the abolition}} of monarchic rule, {{but it was not}} until 1946 that a one-party people's republic was established. It became a part of the Soviet sphere of influence under the leadership of Georgi Dimitrov (1946–1949), who laid the foundations for a rapidly industrialising Stalinist state which was also highly repressive with thousands of dissidents executed. By the mid-1950s <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> rose significantly, while political repressions were lessened. By the 1980s both national and per capita GDPs quadrupled, but the economy remained prone to debt spikes, the most severe taking place in 1960, 1977 and 1980. The Soviet-style planned economy saw some market-oriented policies emerging on an experimental level under Todor Zhivkov (1954–1989). His daughter Lyudmila bolstered national pride by promoting Bulgarian heritage, culture and arts worldwide. In an attempt to erase the identity of the ethnic Turk minority, an assimilation campaign was launched in 1984 which included closing mosques and forcing ethnic Turks to adopt Slavic names. These policies (combined with the end of communist rule in 1989) resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 ethnic Turks to Turkey.|$|E

40|$|In France, the {{conventional}} way of measuring income inequalities uses a definition <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> which only covers monetary resources.

40|$|The {{well-being}} {{of older people}} is an increasingly important issue. This is due to both the increasing proportion of older people in the population and rising levels of inequality in New Zealand. What well-being is and what influences well-being is an important question when considering the welfare <b>of</b> older people. <b>Standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> and quality <b>of</b> life offer two different ways of understanding well-being. It is vital to understand the impact that changing <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> has on older people’s quality of life. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the relationship between <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> and quality <b>of</b> life and consider the impact of other factors on quality of life for older people in New Zealand. This study is a secondary analysis of data from the 2012 wave of the New Zealand Longitudinal Study of Ageing. This study includes 2984 people aged between 50 and 87 years of age. Bivariate and hierarchical multiple regression analysis was employed to explore the relationship between <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living,</b> quality <b>of</b> life, health-related variables (physical health, mental health, depression, mobility and loneliness) and demographic variables. Results revealed two main findings. Firstly, that a low <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> does not preclude a high quality of life, but a high <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> means a low quality of life is less likely. Secondly, the relationship between <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> and quality <b>of</b> life is mediated by health-related variables. Psychological health-related variables (mental health, depression and loneliness) mediated the relationship more than physical health-related variables (physical health and mobility). These demonstrate that although a high <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> is not a prerequisite for a high quality of life, it can potentially provide a buffer against factors which cause poor quality of life such as poor physical and mental health. Increases in <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> for older people can therefore act to mitigate key factors contributing to poor quality of life. These findings have important implications for future policy development in relation to the welfare of older New Zealanders...|$|R
