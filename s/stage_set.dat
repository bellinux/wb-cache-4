The dualism between Blackmore's flamboyant guitar playing, which he had honed in many years of daily practice and experimented on tour with Sutch, and Lord's rocking Hammond solos was still in an embryonic stage, but it would soon {{become an integral part}} of the band's dynamics.|$|E

5|$|The plot of Sherlock Holmes Baffled is {{unrelated}} to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's canonical Sherlock Holmes stories; {{it is likely}} that the character's name was used purely for its familiarity with the public. Shot from a single point of view on a <b>stage</b> <b>set,</b> the intention of Sherlock Holmes Baffled was probably to act as a showcase for basic film trickery and film editing effects, particularly the stop trick first developed four years earlier in 1896 by French director Georges Méliès.|$|E

5|$|By the 1920s {{a series}} of new palaces were {{constructed}} elsewhere for the king's use; these included the more modern Dusit Palace, constructed in 1903, and Phaya Thai Palace in 1909. These other Bangkok residences began to replace the Grand Palace as the primary place of residence of the monarch and his court. By 1925 this gradual {{move out of the}} palace was complete. The growth and centralization of the Siamese state also meant that the various government ministries have grown in size and were finally moved out of the Grand Palace to their own premises. Despite this the Grand Palace remained the official and ceremonial place of residence as well as the <b>stage</b> <b>set</b> for elaborate ancient ceremonies of the monarchy. The end of the absolute monarchy came in 1932, when a revolution overthrew the ancient system of government and replaced it with a constitutional monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Ciocia {{writes that}} {{with half the}} novel taking place in {{theatrical}} settings, Nan may be playing a role as character in her own life or a play on a <b>stage</b> <b>set</b> in a theatre or the streets of London. She starts as a spectator watching Kitty onstage, and later with Kitty, watching how men move and behave to improve their act. She becomes a performer, with Kitty, as a renter and again for the predatory Diana and her friends. Finally she takes the role of director as she assists and impels Ralph to perform his speech. At this point, {{she is able to}} reconcile her identity and the story ends. Waters consciously chose to create a complicated plot, and was impressed with Iris Murdoch's claim that she herself had entire stories worked out well in advance of writing them, a method Waters used with Tipping the Velvet.|$|E

40|$|Mise à {{disposition}} du document numérique avec l'aimable autorisation de l'éditeurInternational audienceThe art of <b>stage</b> <b>setting</b> is {{of central}} {{value for the}} esthetic theory of atmosphere in many respects. Atmospheres seem to be something vague, something of disputable ontological status. But in the artof <b>stage</b> <b>setting</b> {{we have a long}} tradition of talking about atmospheres and of practical skills to deal with atmospheres. Atmospheres seemto be something irrational, something numinous. But <b>stage</b> <b>setting</b> proves that we can "make" atmospheres. Atmospheres seem to be something essentially subjective. But the whole art of <b>stage</b> <b>setting</b> would be in vain, if {{it was not possible to}} produce atmospheres on the stage which were not perceived in the same way be a broader audience. The theory of atmospheres starts as an esthetic of perception; as such it is a quite recent approach. But much can be learned fromthe perspective of production. <b>Stage</b> <b>setting</b> since antiquity has accumulated quite a lot of knowledge of atmospheres. These are thereason why it is worth to study <b>stage</b> <b>setting</b> and talk with stage setters when trying to enhance the esthetic theory of atmosphere...|$|R

25|$|Cooper {{took his}} concept to Paramount Studios {{in the first}} years of the Great Depression but {{executives}} shied away from a project that sent film crews on costly shoots to Africa and Komodo. In 1931, David O. Selznick brought Cooper to RKO as his executive assistant, and, to sweeten the deal, promised him he could make his own films. Cooper began immediately developing The Most Dangerous Game, a story about a big game hunter, and hired his friend and former film partner, Ernest B. Schoedsack, to direct. A huge jungle <b>stage</b> <b>set</b> was built, with Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray as the stars. Once the film was underway, Cooper turned his attention to the studio's big-budget-out-of-control fantasy, Creation, a story about a group of travelers shipwrecked on an island of dinosaurs. The film employed special effects wizard Willis O'Brien.|$|E
25|$|The Man on a Balcony leans nonchalantly {{against a}} {{balustrade}} occupying the foreground of the composition. At first glance he appears bathed in natural light. But upon close examination {{there is no}} clear light source or direction from which the light emanates, giving the overall work the theatrical feeling of a <b>stage</b> <b>set.</b> Aimed at a wide audience, the models monumental three-dimensional presence 'gazes' at the spectator, while the spectator contemplates the painting in return. Just as in Gleizes' Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon (1911) and Les Baigneuses (The Bathers) of the same year, there is present throughout an interplay of perpendicular lines and hyperbolic arcs that produce a rhythm that permeate the complex urban backdrop; here of smokestacks, train tracks, windows, bridge girders and clouds (the view from the balcony of the doctors office on the avenue de l'Opéra).|$|E

Angle also delivered an overhead belly to belly suplex through the plated glass <b>stage</b> <b>set,</b> but McMahon did not break through on the first attempt, causing him to fall head-first onto the concrete floor. After a successful second attempt, Angle was to put him through a second plate {{back out to the}} stage and again failed two more times. The match also had Shane missing a shooting star press and ended with Angle performing the Angle Slam off the top rope before scoring the victory over a bloodied McMahon.|$|E

Productions were put on during the summer seasons until musicals ceased in 1968 after West Side Story, apart from a YMCA production in 1982. In 1997 the dressing rooms and <b>stage</b> <b>set</b> building on the island were demolished and the seating removed.
