The player controls either Annie or Clint <b>sidestepping</b> and jumping in the foreground while shooting down enemy robots in the background and dodging enemy bullets. These gameplay mechanics combine elements from third-person shooters and light gun games.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit {{spending}} and debt levels. However, in the early 2000s, some EU member states were failing {{to stay within the}} confines of the Maastricht criteria and turned to securitising future government revenues to reduce their debts and/or deficits, <b>sidestepping</b> best practice and ignoring international standards. This allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels through a combination of techniques, including inconsistent accounting, off-balance-sheet transactions, and the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures. From late 2009 on, after Greece's newly elected, PASOK government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit, fears of sovereign defaults in certain European states developed in the public, and the government debt of several states was downgraded. The crisis subsequently spread to Ireland and Portugal, while raising concerns about Italy, Spain, and the European banking system, and more fundamental imbalances within the eurozone.|$|E
5|$|Like most shooter games, first-person {{shooters}} involve an avatar, {{one or more}} ranged weapons, and a varying {{number of}} enemies. Because they {{take place in a}} 3D environment, these games tend to be somewhat more realistic than 2D shooter games, and have more accurate representations of gravity, lighting, sound and collisions. First-person shooters played on personal computers are most often controlled with a combination of a keyboard and mouse. This system has been claimed as superior to that found in console games, which frequently use two analog sticks: one used for running and <b>sidestepping,</b> the other for looking and aiming. It is common to display the character's hands and weaponry in the main view, with a head-up display showing health, ammunition and location details. Often, it is possible to overlay a map of the surrounding area.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: Anterior {{cruciate}} ligament (ACL) injuries are a serious problem, {{with a high}} incidence and serious consequences. Published clinical screening tests are based on 2 -legged and controlled drop jumps, but ACL injuries are known to occur in single-legged landings and <b>sidestep</b> cutting, where the load is predominantly distributed to a single leg. Purpose: To describe knee kinematics and kinetics in drop jumps and <b>sidestep</b> cutting and investigate the rank correlation of knee valgus angles and knee abduction moments between and within these movements. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 120 elite female handball players (mean ± SD: age, 22. 4 ± 7. 1 years; height, 171 ± 7 cm; weight, 67 ± 7 kg), each performed 3 drop jumps and 3 sport-specific <b>sidestep</b> cuts to each side. Kinematics and kinetics were calculated from high-speed 3 -dimensional motion analysis. Results: Knee kinematics and kinetics were significantly different between drop jumps and <b>sidestep</b> cutting. The knee abduction moment was 6 times higher in <b>sidestep</b> cutting (1. 58 ± 0. 60 Nm/kg vs 0. 25 ± 0. 16 Nm/kg). There was a poor correlation between knee abduction moments (ρ = 0. 135) in the 2 tasks, but a moderate correlation (ρ = 0. 706) for knee valgus angles. There was a poor correlation between knee valgus angles in drop jumps and knee abduction moments in <b>sidestep</b> cuts (ρ = 0. 238). Conclusion: Motion patterns are different between drop jumps and <b>sidestep</b> cutting. There is a moderate correlation for knee abduction moments between the 2 tasks, but knee abduction moments are less consistent across tasks. Clinical Relevance: Knee valgus angles during drop jumps do not predict knee abduction moments during <b>sidestep</b> cutting. The moderate correlation of knee valgus angles in drop jumps and <b>sidestep</b> cutting indicates that this measure may be more relevant for screening efforts...|$|R
40|$|Background Common {{lower limb}} postures {{have been found}} when noncontact {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries occur during <b>sidestep</b> cutting tasks. These same postures {{have been linked to}} knee loadings known to stress the ACL. Hypothesis Whole body technique modification would reduce knee loading. Study Design Controlled laboratory study. Methods Experienced team sport athletes were recruited for whole body <b>sidestep</b> cutting technique modification. Before and after a 6 -week technique modification training, participants performed <b>sidestep</b> cutting tasks while ground-reaction force and motion data were collected. A kinematic and inverse dynamics model was used to calculate 3 -dimensional knee loading during <b>sidestep</b> cutting. Results At initial foot contact, the participants placed their stance foot closer to the body's midline and held their torso more upright, in line with the aims of the technique modification training. This was accompanied by significantly lower peak valgus moments in the weight acceptance phase of stance. Both postural changes were correlated with the change in peak valgus moment. Conclusion Whole body <b>sidestep</b> cutting technique modification resulted in reduced knee loading. Clinical Relevance Implementation of whole body technique modification may produce effective ACL injury prevention programs in sports involving <b>sidestep</b> cutting. Full Tex...|$|R

The 31st Regiment of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division would take over the Triangle Hill area while the 17th Regiment of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division maintained control over Sniper Ridge. On the same day, fresh Chinese reinforcements were converging on the Kimhwa front. The PVA High Command ordered the 12th Corps to be placed {{under the command of}} the 15th Corps and Qin Jiwei ordered the 86th and 87th Regiments of the 29th Division to link up with the 45th Division for a new counterattack. The 45th Division also received 1,200 new recruits to reconstitute 13 of its infantry companies. About 67 heavy guns and one regiment of anti-aircraft artillery were made available to support the upcoming counterattack. All Chinese reinforcements were focused on Triangle Hill, with Sniper Ridge considered secondary.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the nomination, Kemp became the ticket's spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to {{agreement on the}} self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March, Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic, and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political <b>sidestepping.</b> As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described {{as if he was}} the Presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemp's style, referring to him as the Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as U.S. News & World Report writer Steven V. Roberts, criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills. During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemp's voice on minority issues, Colin Powell's support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer, school vouchers and criminal justice, the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.|$|E

25|$|A common paradox {{occurs with}} {{mathematical}} idealizations such as s which describe physical phenomena well at distant or global scales but break {{down at the}} point itself. These paradoxes are sometimes seen as relating to Zeno's paradoxes which all deal with the physical manifestations of mathematical properties of continuity, infinitesimals, and infinities often associated with space and time. For example, the electric field associated with a point charge is infinite {{at the location of}} the point charge. A consequence of this apparent paradox is that the electric field of a point-charge can only be described in a limiting sense by a carefully constructed Dirac delta function. This mathematically inelegant but physically useful concept allows for the efficient calculation of the associated physical conditions while conveniently <b>sidestepping</b> the philosophical issue of what actually occurs at the infinitesimally-defined point: a question that physics is as yet unable to answer. Fortunately, a consistent theory of quantum electrodynamics removes the need for infinitesimal point charges altogether.|$|E
25|$|Herb Steger {{replaced}} Roby {{to start}} the fourth. Steger fumbled, making the Wolverines punt from their own 25-yard line. Reese again showed skill in his <b>sidestepping,</b> but was injured. Red Rountree replaced him. Goebel eventually came back in and hurled a pass, which if complete may have got 25 yards, but Rountree broke up the pass, forcing a punt. In desperation, Goebel was now often passing; and the Commodores were often deflecting the passes. A 15-yard penalty made it 3rd down and 33 for the Wolverines. On fourth down, Goebel attempted a 45-yard place kick which fell short of the cross bar. The last try for Michigan involved two incomplete passes, an attempted end run by Steger, and an interception by Commodore guard Fatty Lawrence. Vanderbilt had the ball at Michigan's 48-yard line as the game ended. It is said the tie was preserved when Neely recovered a fumble near the Commodore goal.|$|E

Morgan continued east to the Ohio River where, just north of modern Ravenswood, West Virginia, there was a ford at Buffington Island {{that would allow him}} to cross over into that state. Burnside correctly guessed Morgan's intentions. Federal columns under Edward H. Hobson and Henry M. Judah and river gunboats swiftly converged to contest any river crossing. Burnside also sent a militia regiment from Marietta, Ohio, to hold the ford until the Federal forces could arrive. Morgan arrived on the evening of July 18, but decided not to attack the militia in the gathering darkness. It proved to be a mistake.|$|E

On the evening of 29 January, divisional artillery fired 16,000 105 mm and 155 mm rounds during a three-hour preparation for the assault of the 7th and 15th Infantry Regiments south across the Colmar Canal. The infantry crossed between 21:00 and midnight. After the crossings were secured, engineers began the construction of three Bailey Bridges over the canal to enable armored vehicles to cross. The following day, the French armored combat commands CC4 and CC5 (both of the 5th Armored Division) crossed the canal, with CC4 supporting the U.S. 7th Infantry and CC5 supporting the U.S. 15th Infantry. Soon thereafter, the 15th Infantry and CC5 took Urschenheim in a brisk action, while the 7th Infantry was held {{up in front of}} Horbourg. The same day, the 254th Infantry attacked east toward Artzenheim with support of the French armored combat command CC6, but the Germans employed artillery support and dug-in Jagdpanther tank destroyers to parry the thrust, destroying six French tanks and four halftracks. Artzenheim was taken by the French II Corps on 1 February.|$|E
