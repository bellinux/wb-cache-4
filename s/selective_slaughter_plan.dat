40|$|Objective/Background: Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (BTb) {{is mainly}} {{a disease of}} cattle, although it continues to infect human populations across the world. Operation of a test and <b>slaughter</b> <b>plan</b> in Iran since 1981 has lowered the frequency of BTb from > 5 % to < 0. 14 % at the national scale. In 2015, unusual uncontrollable epidemics of BTb were detected in two cattle farms in municipal suburbs of Qazvin and Isfahan. These farms had a tuberculin-test-certified record of BTb-free status for the past 5 consecutive years, with no new cattle registered with {{either of the two}} herds during this time period. Routine tuberculination of the bovids in 2015 resulted in the detection of tuberculin-positive animals that were subsequently removed from the herds. Serial tuberculin tests improved the situation, as new reactors were found each time. The aim of this research is based on isolation and identification of Mycobacterium from infected animals in both farms. Methods: To investigate the situation, major mesenteric/mediastinal lymph nodes from the culled reactor animals along with specimens from bulk milk tanks, trapped rats living on the farms, and environmental specimens were collected and subjected to bacterial culture. Tuberculin-positive cattle were also subjected to paratuberculosis enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), ESAT- 6 ELISA, and gamma-interferon tests. Results: In bacterial culture, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium microti, and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis were isolated from collected specimens at both farms. Conclusion: There is circumstantial evidence supported by previous studies to expect a high frequency of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection in Iranian cattle/sheep farms. This observation might explain the large skin reaction size seen at the avian tuberculin injection site in tested animals in these farms. Introduction of a third infection with M. microti, possibly by rodents visiting the farms, might have triggered immunological reactions that have ended the surge of BTb. If correct, we assume that a technical review of the Iranian test and slaughter scheme against BTb is required to address persisting cases of BTb in disease-free farms, as described here...|$|R

5000|$|By late 901, the {{powerful}} palace eunuchs, upon learning of a plot between Emperor Zhaozong and the chancellor Cui Yin to <b>slaughter</b> them, <b>planned</b> to kill Cui. In response, Cui summoned Zhu Quanzhong to the imperial capital Chang'an with an army. Upon hearing of Zhu's impending arrival, the eunuchs, led by Han Quanhui, seized Emperor Zhaozong and {{fled to the}} domain of Han's ally Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). Zhu soon arrived in Chang'an's vicinity and, at Cui's urging, put Fengxiang's capital Fengxiang Municipality under siege. [...] With Fengxiang under siege, Emperor Zhaozong issued an edict (possibly under the eunuchs' duress) in spring 902 to Yang, commissioning him as the overall commander of the circuits to the east, bestowing him the honorary chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling (中書令), and created him the Prince of Wu. The edict ordered Yang to attack Zhu from the east. (The edict was delivered by Li Yan, {{the son of the}} retired chancellor Zhang Jun, on whom Emperor Zhaozong bestowed the imperial surname of Li. Li Yan would subsequently remain in Yang's domain to serve as the Tang emperor's representative, although after Li Yan's arrival Yang also himself began exercising imperial authority, as the edict that Li Yan delivered authorized him to do so.) Yang thereafter prepared a campaign against Zhu.|$|R
5000|$|The state {{received}} $151 {{million from}} the federal government in early 2010, of which $58 million was planned to be used to build an 11 mi stretch of track between Riga and Byron capable of 110 mph speeds.

The remainder of the money was used to construct a second track between Albany and Schenectady. [...] Negotiations between the state and CSX around the Western New York third track came to a halt in late spring of 2010 after CSX disclosed a requirement that the new track be located at least 30 ft from its right-of-way; in some places along the route, that amount of space is unavailable. The two parties subsequently came to an agreement, however, after further meetings arranged by Representative Louise <b>Slaughter,</b> allowing <b>planning</b> for the trackage to continue. Between Albany and Schenectady, construction of the third track is planned to begin in 2011. An additional $354 million, composed of funds rejected by other states, was granted to New York in May 2011. Of that, $58 million will be allocated to the ongoing Albany-Schenectady upgrades, $1.4 million will be allocated for a preliminary study for a new terminal in Rochester, and the remainder will go to New York City.|$|R

40|$|A solar {{process heat}} (SPH) data network has been {{developed}} to access remote-site performance data from operational solar heat systems. Each SPH system in the data network is outfitted with monitoring equipment and a datalogger. The datalogger is accessed via modem from the data network computer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The dataloggers collect both ten-minute and hourly data and download it to the data network every 24 -hours for archiving, processing, and plotting. The system data collected includes energy delivered (fluid temperatures and flow rates) and site meteorological conditions, such as solar insolation and ambient temperature. The SPH performance data network was created for collecting performance data from SPH systems that are serving in industrial applications or from systems using technologies that show promise for industrial applications. The network {{will be used to}} identify areas of SPH technology needing further development, to correlate computer models with actual performance, and to improve the credibility of SPH technology. The SPH data network also provides a centralized bank of user-friendly performance data that will give prospective SPH users an indication of how actual systems perform. There are currently three systems being monitored and archived under the SPH data network: two are parabolic trough systems and the third is a flat-plate system. The two trough systems both heat water for prisons; the hot water is used for personal hygiene, kitchen operations, and laundry. The flat plate system heats water for meat processing at a <b>slaughter</b> house. We <b>plan</b> to connect another parabolic trough system to the network during the first months of 1996. We continue to look for good examples of systems using other types of collector technologies and systems serving new applications (such as absorption chilling) to include in the SPH performance data network...|$|R
40|$|The oratorio La strage degl'Innocenti (1665) and the sepolcro Il Pentimento, l'Amore verso Dio, con il Pianto delle Marie, et de Peccatori (1661) are {{his only}} {{surviving}} sacred dramatic works by Antonio Bertali. Together {{they represent the}} composer’s mature style which excels in technical skill, rhetorical ingenuity, and musical coherence. Born in or near Verona in c 1605, Bertali moved to Vienna in 1624. At the imperial court {{he worked as a}} violinist, composer and teacher. After Giovanni Valentini’s death in 1649, Bertali succeeded him as imperial chapel master. Testimonies by his contemporaries and the wide dissemination of his works throughout Europe bear witness to his great popularity as a composer during the seventeenth century. Although Bertali also composed secular works, his main task as imperial chapel master concerned the sacred music at court The libretto of La strage degl'Innocenti is loosely based on an epic poem by Giambattista Marino with the same title. It depicts King Herod amidst his counsellors, in fear of being deposed in favour of the new-born king. Whilst the first two counsellors confirm Herod's rage and advise him {{to go ahead with the}} <b>planned</b> <b>slaughter</b> of the children, the third counsellor warns Herod against the consequences of such cruelty and the folly of acting against the divine plan. Nonetheless, Herod and his ministers proceed to the massacre. The second half of the libretto focuses on three mothers lamenting their children's fate whilst Herod's soldiers draw near. All tears being in vain, the killing goes ahead. The breathtaking final chorus bewails the dying children and submits that heaven will take its revenge in time. Il Pentimento is an example of a sepolcro, a typically Viennese sub-genre of the oratorio, which flourished at the imperial court between c 1660 and 1705. As in many other Viennese churches, replicas of the Holy Sepulchre were erected in the Hofburgkapelle and the chapel of empress dowager Eleonora during Holy Week. There they served as backdrop for the semi-staged sepolcro performances. The dramatic plot of Antonio Draghi's libretto for Il Pentimento is minimal: The work begins with a lament for the dead Jesus by the allegorical figures Il Pentimento (Penance) and Amor verso Dio (Love of God). Both declare that they would rather die themselves. This topic is continued in a dialogue between Mary (the mother of Jesus) and Mary Magdalene. Eventually, they are joined by two penitent sinners and the four indulge in an extended contemplation about the nature of sin, with its only ray of light being the hope for redemption. The final sequence, however, reminds all human beings of penitence, fear, the tomb, and worms as a memento of their own mortality...|$|R
40|$|The Namibian meat {{industry}} {{relies on}} the export of weaners to the South African feedlot industry while the largest part of the cattle population in the communal areas of Namibia remain underutilised. Producing a marketable cattle carcass for slaughter, which contributes the most to the Namibian economy, remains a challenge that needs {{a high level of}} understanding of all management variables under control by the rangeland manager. The nutritional requirements of cattle are one the important areas for maximising the return from the land and ensuring long term sustainability of the farming enterprise. A commercial farming enterprise, with the same climate and sandy soils that were predominantly found in the communal farming areas of Namibia, was chosen as experimental site. Three groupings of cattle were exposed to different experimental techniques and treatments over a 15 month trial period. The first grouping of cattle was 6 oesophageal fistulated cattle used, to collect veld samples selected by the cattle, every 3 weeks to estimate the contribution of the tree and shrub savannah towards the diet of the cattle. The second grouping was 110 cattle allocated to different nutrient supplementation treatments for slaughter at 28 months of age. Five different nutrient supplementation treatments were chosen for 5 groups of 22 cattle, consisting of steers and heifers, {{for the duration of the}} period on an ad libitum basis. The 5 treatments were applied to illustrate the economic concept of diminishing marginal returns as the increasing feeding cost progressively deteriorated the amount of profit that would be expected. The optimal supplementation strategy would thus be identified according to the financial resources available to a farmer. Some of the treatments were also planned to progressively result in negative associative effects on forage intake, as energy containing raw materials in such treatments would replace the intake of natural available forage. The need for replacing forage was a common practice in droughts when the availability of forage was limiting or when the finishing of cattle during a short period before <b>slaughter</b> was <b>planned.</b> The cattle needed to be foraging less to conserve energy and thus increase protein accretion and fat deposition. The control of the experiment was the rock salt treatment group (RST) which only received a rock salt lick throughout the dry and wet seasons of the year. This was generally used for the supplementation of wildlife and cattle on rangeland in Namibia and it placed nearly no strain on the finances of a farmer. The remaining four treatments received commercially manufactured lick products with a diverse set of applications that were not strictly used according to the manufacturer's guidelines. During the wet season it was a well-established practice to only supplement with phosphorus and trace mineral containing licks due to the forage having maximum nutritional value during this time in which no additional benefit would be derived from the supplementation of protein and energy containing licks. All treatments, except for the rock salt treatment group (RST), were thus placed on a phosphorus and trace mineral lick during the wet season as part of the nutrient supplementation treatment programs. Different licks were made available to the cattle in the treatment groups, during the dry season, from which the treatment groups derived their names. One group was placed on a phosphorus and trace mineral lick for the duration of the trial, during the wet and dry season, and defined as the 6 % phosphorus treatment group (6 %PT). A maintenance treatment group (MTT) received protein in addition to phosphorus in the lick during the dry season. The production treatment group (PDT) received energy containing raw materials in addition to the minerals and protein as established in the MTT. The finisher treatment group (FST) received a larger amount of energy containing materials which diluted the mineral and protein concentration of the dry season lick even further than in the PDT. The third experimental procedure was to establish a group of 5 ruminally cannulated cattle that would individually be rotated every 3 weeks between the supplement fed treatment groups. The cattle would then be sampled for ruminal fluid, blood and faeces to observe the short term impact of the supplements during the different seasons on these variables and the diagnostic value of these parameters to indicate the nutritional status of cattle. The results clearly illustrated that the cattle had exhibited “nutritional wisdom”. The selection of higher quality plant material than what was on offer in the veld was highlighted in a review of previous oesophageal fistulated cattle research. The strong influence of rainfall on the forage quality (increased phosphorus and protein) was highlighted. During spring the phosphorus and protein reached their maximum concentrations. It was only during the wet season that animal performances were optimised when the quantity of high quality forage increased. The average daily ad libitum nutrient supplement consumption per animal on the different treatments was strongly influenced by these seasonal changes in forage quality and quantity. The lick intake increased as the dry season progressed and the quality of the forage the animals were able to select decreased. During spring the lick intake sharply decreased as the forage quality improved. The cattle adapted their intake level with the aim of maximising their energy intake, which resulted in the highest possible performance possible, from the forage and lick that was on offer to them. Monitoring the average monthly lick intake per animal would give valuable information to the farmer on the quality of the forage selected. The trends observed in average lick intake during the year could be used as an inexpensive indicator of veld qualit. An upper threshold could be set on lick intakes that would signal that a specific area was optimally grazed and that a camp rotation would aid in conserving the rangeland and optimise animal performance. The year round supplementation of rock salt lick group (RST), or alternatively no nutrient supplement, under these conditions had clearly shown a minimal contribution to the nutritional status of cattle and that this strategy would lead to certain financial underperformance or ruin of the cattle farmer. From the results presented, the year round supplementation with a phosphorus and trace mineral lick (6 %PT) was indicated as the absolute minimum nutrient supplementation strategy that would need to be followed in all communal and commercial cattle farming areas of Namibia and probably similar farming locations around the world. Free access to phosphorus licks throughout the year to growing cattle must be ensured by the farmer to allow the cattle to select the correct amount that it would require to optimise performance. This strategy required the least amount of capital to implement and had the largest return on investment for a newly established farmer. If limited amounts of energy containing materials (molasses, maize, bran) were included in the nutrient supplement on offer it allowed the animal the opportunity to only consume the minimum amount of phosphorus that it required throughout the year to balance the shortages that occurred in the forage that it was selecting from. The finisher lick given during the dry season on the FST clearly illustrated that salt and phosphorus were poor regulators of supplemental intake if the cattle were able to increase their total energy retention by over consuming and probably excreting of minerals. The optimum nutrient supplementation strategy was the MTT that alleviated the primary phosphorus and secondary protein shortages during the dry season. This strategy had a much higher capital requirement and would be most suitable for the established cattle farmer that was able to afford this strategy or had access to credit. The PDT and FST were associated with higher supplementation costs that resulted in the highest turnover for the cattle farmer, although at lower profit than the MTT. The PDT and FST supplementation strategies would be more appropriate if the improved nutritional status of the cattle was utilised in a cow herd for improved reproduction or in stud farming when genetic expression of growth potential would offset the cost of supplementation.
