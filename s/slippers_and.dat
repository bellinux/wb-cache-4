5|$|The Society of Friends {{had become}} {{established}} {{there by the}} mid-17th century. One Quaker family, the Clarks, started a business in sheepskin rugs, woollen <b>slippers</b> <b>and,</b> later, boots and shoes.

5|$|One of {{the largest}} souks is Souk Semmarine, which sells {{everything}} from brightly coloured bejewelled sandals and <b>slippers</b> <b>and</b> leather pouffes to jewellery and kaftans. Souk Ableuh contains stalls which specialize in lemons, chilis, capers, pickles, green, red, and black olives, and mint, a common ingredient of Moroccan cuisine and tea. Similarly, Souk Kchacha specializes in dried fruit and nuts, including dates, figs, walnuts, cashews and apricots. Rahba Qedima contains stalls selling hand-woven baskets, natural perfumes, knitted hats, scarves, tee shirts, Ramadan tea, ginseng, and alligator and iguana skins. Criee Berbiere, to the northeast of this market, is noted for its dark Berber carpets and rugs. Souk Siyyaghin {{is known for its}} jewellery, and Souk Smata nearby is noted for its extensive collection of babouches and belts. Souk Cherratine specializes in leatherware, and Souk Belaarif sells modern consumer goods. Souk Haddadine specializes in ironware and lanterns.|$|E
5|$|Towns such as Castle Cary and Frome grew {{around the}} medieval weaving industry. Street {{developed}} as a centre {{for the production of}} woollen <b>slippers</b> <b>and,</b> later, boots and shoes, with C. & J. Clark establishing its headquarters in the town. C Clark's shoes are no longer manufactured there as the work was transferred to lower-wage areas, such as China and Asia. Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the UK. C Clark also had shoe factories, at one time at Bridgwater, Minehead, Westfield and Weston super Mare to provide employment outside the main summer tourist season, but those satellite sites were closed in the late 1980s, before the main site at Street. Dr. Martens shoes were also made in Somerset, by the Northampton-based R. Griggs Group, using redundant skilled shoemakers from C Clark; that work has also been transferred to Asia.|$|E

25|$|A ballet of the Renaissance {{was a far}} {{cry from}} the form of {{theatrical}} entertainment known to audiences today. Tutus, ballet <b>slippers</b> <b>and</b> pointe work were not yet used. The choreography was adapted from court dance steps. Performers dressed in fashions of the times. For women that meant formal gowns that covered their legs to the ankle. Early ballet was participatory, with the audience joining the dance towards the end.|$|E
25|$|Subsidiary industries, {{such as the}} {{manufacture}} of machinery, electric motors and wire fabric, are of considerable importance. Angoulême is the most inland navigable port on the Charente River. The traditional river boat is the Gabare. Iron and copper founding, brewing and tanning also continue. The manufacture of gunpowder, confectionery, heavy iron goods, gloves, boots and shoes (including the traditional pantoufle carpet <b>slippers)</b> <b>and</b> cotton goods are also important. There is {{wholesale and retail trade}} in wine, cognac and building-stone.|$|E
25|$|After the Germans {{closed down}} Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin, Frumer fled to Warsaw {{and moved into}} the Warsaw Ghetto, where he {{continued}} to study Torah and produce chidushim (original Torah insights). He and another Sochatchover Hasid, Rabbi Avremele Weinberg, directed the clandestine education of several hundred Sochatchover yeshiva students in the ghetto {{under the direction of}} the third Sochatchover Rebbe, Rabbi Dovid Bornsztain, who was also incarcerated there. As the Nazi deportations increased in frequency, Frumer and his Rebbe joined other Torah scholars who disguised themselves as workers in a large shoe factory owned by Fritz Schulz. Frumer worked in the Wooden and Fur Shoe section, which produced wooden clogs and fur <b>slippers</b> <b>and</b> supplied footwear for the German soldiers on the Russian front. While he worked, he reviewed his Torah studies by heart.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] {{talks about}} females wanting to submissevely serve their male love {{interests}} {{and take care}} of them as they admire their hard work and are inspired by them. The trio further sings about the men of their lives {{and the way in which}} they will take care of them. [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] was written as a continuation on the previous song on Destiny Fulfilled, [...] "Soldier"; after the trio sings about finding a suitable lover in the aforementioned song, they express a will to cater to him in [...] "Cater 2 U". In the second edition of the book Introducing Cultural Studies, the authors argued that the song contained lyrics about objectification of women, which suggested that their gender role was to [...] "'keep herself up', 'keep it right', 'cater to' their man by providing him with his dinner, a foot rub, a manicure, fetching his <b>slippers,</b> <b>and</b> much more, on demand". An editor writing in The Times of India found a theme of feminine assertiveness in [...] "Cater 2 U"; he noted that [...] "the women come off not so much as lovers as full-service romantic servants". J. Freedom du Lac, a staff writer of The Washington Post wrote that the song's theme was supplication.|$|E
500|$|With its {{independence}} came a new [...] apogee, {{and for a}} brief time Seibal became a prominent regional capital located on the important Pasión River trade route. The architecture and ceramics from this period demonstrate connections with the northern Yucatán Peninsula and the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Seventeen stelae carved between AD 849 and 889 show a mix of Maya and foreign styles, including a lord wearing the beaked mask of Ehecatl, the central Mexican wind god, with a Mexican-style speech scroll emerging from the mouth, carvings of foreign-style foot <b>slippers,</b> <b>and</b> squared cartouches. Some of these stelae have a stylistic affinity with the painted murals at Cacaxtla, a site in the central Mexican state of Tlaxcala. This hybrid style seem to indicate that the new lords of Seibal were Maya lords adapting to changing political conditions by adopting a mix of symbols originating from both lowland Maya and central Mexican sources. Some of the more foreign-looking stelae even bear non-Maya calendrical glyphs. Changes at Seibal at this time are associated with the Chontal-controlled trade flowing along the Pasión River. The Chontal Maya themselves were warrior-merchants originating from the Gulf Coast of Mexico who displayed a mixture of Maya and non-Maya characteristics.|$|E
