In places such as Hong Kong, where depths of competent founding soils/bedrock vary greatly, the pile lengths can vary from a few meters to over 100 m. Following the current practice of pile design and acceptance, the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> pile foundations can be considerably different from one site to another. The objective {{of this paper is}} to evaluate ranges <b>of</b> the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> buildings <b>supported</b> by driven pile foundations. Settlement measurements from full-scale static load tests on a large number of piles are reported. From the load-displacement curves of these load tests, the distributions <b>of</b> the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> single piles under the intended design load, twice the design load, and the failure load are determined. The <b>settlements</b> <b>of</b> single piles at the intended design load vary from less than 10 mm for relatively short piles to about 30 mm for long piles and the settlements at twice the design load vary from 18 mm to 85 mm. The single pile settlement follows approximately a lognormal distribution. The <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> a pile group is then obtained by multiplying the single pile settlement by a group settlement ratio that is defined as the ratio of the pile group settlement to the single pile settlement under the same load per pile. The distribution <b>of</b> the <b>settlement</b> ratio for freestanding pile groups in sand is established based on data from some field and model pile group tests.

Deficiencies in both the regulatory and supervisory framework that govern life insurance companies in Jamaica apparently provided the basis for the imprudent management of some companies.

This advanced testing method is {{used to examine the}} <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> footings <b>supported</b> on granular columns. Two important features of the equipment are (a) the axial loading system which allows samples to be consolidated under K-o condition while the load is applied onto a small foundation area of the sample, and (b) a relatively large sample size of 300 -mm diameter and 400 -mm high. The system is also equipped with pressure cells located beneath the footing and top cap to measure the pressure distribution with respect to foundation displacement and a lateral strain gage to monitor boundary effects. This paper reports on some of the early findings from the preliminary tests carried out using this equipment. Samples for testing were prepared by consolidating kaolin slurry in a large one-dimensional consolidation chamber. The granular columns were installed using the replacement method by compacting crushed basalt (uniformly graded with 90 % between 1. 5 - 2 -mm particle sizes) into a preformed hole.

40|$|Aggregate piers are an {{alternative}} ground improvement technique used {{for improving the}} bearing capacity and reducing the total and differential <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> foundations <b>supported</b> on compressible soils. The piers are composed {{of a series of}} vibrationally compacted aggregate lifts from a desired depth up to the finished foundation level. The shear strength of the coarse-grained material comprising an aggregate pier is defined by its internal friction angle. There are several factors affecting the friction angle of the granular material that include: confining stress, particle shape, relative density and particle distribution (gradation). These factors are not directly considered in the design of aggregate columns. However, because the granular material friction angle is a fundamental design parameter used to estimate the bearing capacity of aggregate piers, these factors could {{play an important role in}} the mechanical behavior of isolated aggregate columns. Other factors responsible for altering the global performance of aggregate piers are column length and the undrained shear strength of the matrix soil. Full-scale 3 D discrete element method (DEM) simulations were conducted to reproduce field plate load tests performed on small circular foundation resting on single aggregate piers in order to evaluate the effects of these factors on the global performance of aggregate columns. The numerical results demonstrate that incorporating the gradation, confining stress and relative density dependence of the aggregate friction angle in the DEM models provides better numerical estimation of the load-displacement curves observed in the field for both the foundation serviceability level and the ultimate load condition.
