In this report a {{simulation}} oftests with <b>submerged</b> <b>breakwaters,</b> parallel to the shoreline, in a wave basin, are carried out with the morphodynamic model Delft 2 D-MOR. This 2 -dimensional horizontal model was developed by DELFT HYDRAULICS. The aim of this thesis is to find out whether and how this model is able to simulate these tests with <b>submerged</b> <b>breakwaters,</b> and to investigate the effects of these breakwaters on profile development. The conditions ofthe experiments are used as input for the model. One simulation without breakwaters and two simulations with different breakwater configurations are carried out. Comparison of model results with measurement data rom the experiments shows that the model is able to simulate some hydrodynamic and morphological processes induced by the <b>submerged</b> <b>breakwaters.</b> Wave heights in the vicinity ofthe obstacles are reduced because of wave dissipation over the breakwaters. Flow circulation patterns occur induced by water level gradients. Sediment is mainly transported from behind the breakwaters towards and through the gaps seaward. However, there are still quite some differences between model and experimental results. Large amounts of sediment are eroded near the shoreline and close behind the breakwaters, which was not measured during the experiments. Apparently inaccuracies in modelling appear at the boundary of sea and land (original dry points remain dry, bottom gradients are irrealistic large), and at the location of <b>submerged</b> <b>breakwaters</b> where the modelling ofwave behaviour is not adequate. Also problems with resolution of computational grid arise at the location of <b>submerged</b> <b>breakwaters.</b> A higher resolution is needed in order to compute realistic flow velocities close behind the <b>submerged</b> <b>breakwaters.</b> Obviously a lot ofwork has to be done to improve the 2 DH model results such that it can be a useful tooI for modelling the effects of <b>submerged</b> <b>breakwaters</b> on a beach profile.

The influence of this structure on the dynamic equilibrium profile behind the <b>submerged</b> <b>breakwater</b> has to be determined since this alternative saves large quantities of sand and therefore the construction costs are decreased.

What is the difference in the required quantity (m 3) of sand to construct the required dynamic equilibrium profile in comparison with the situation without a perched beach with a <b>submerged</b> <b>breakwater</b> and what is the difference in costs? The objective of this research project is dual and has to give answer to the two research questions for this research project: Determine the effect of a perched beach with a <b>submerged</b> <b>breakwater</b> on the dynamic equilibrium profile of the perched beach for Maasvlakte II; Determine the required quantity of sand required for the dynamic equilibrium profile for the situation with and without a perched beach with a <b>submerged</b> <b>breakwater.</b> In an economical analysis the costs will be compared.

40|$|In {{addition}} to reducing the incoming wave energy, <b>submerged</b> <b>breakwaters</b> also cause a setup {{of the sea}} level in the protected area, which is relevant to the whole shadow zone circulation, including alongshore currents and seaward flows through the gaps. This study examines such a leading hydraulic parameter under the simplified hypothesis of 2 D motion and presents a prediction model that has been validated by a wide ensemble of experimental data. Starting from an approach originally proposed by Dalrymple and Dean [(1971). Piling-up behind low and <b>submerged</b> permeable <b>breakwaters.</b> Discussion note on Diskin et al. (1970). Journal of Waterways and Harbors Division WW 2, 423 â 427], the model splits {{the rise of the}} mean water level into two contributions: one is due to the momentum flux release forced by wave breaking on the structure, and the other is associated with the mass transport process. For the first time, the case of random wave trains has been explicitly considered...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the use of <b>submerged</b> {{detached}} <b>breakwaters</b> as beach protection, a use that today has become quite popular. This type of structure has been largely studied both theoretically and through experimental analyses in recent years, however its behaviour has not been completely understood, specially if related to the real irregular wave attacks. In particular some laboratory studies carried out by the authors have pointed out some interesting phenomena associated with the interaction between the nonlinearities of wave transformations in shallow water and <b>submerged</b> <b>breakwaters.</b> Aiming at discerning between the phenomena related to the structure (beach and breakwater) and flume geometry, a new series of laboratory tests have been carried out in a 50 m long wave flume; these tests and the results obtained are described in this work. Besides the study of the behaviour of submerged structures related to the bounded-long-waves, some current velocities have also been measured during this research through directional micro-propeller fluid meters...|$|R
