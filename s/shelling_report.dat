40|$|We present new total {{intensity}} and linear polarization VLBA {{observations of the}} nu= 2 and nu= 1 J= 1 - 0 maser transitions of SiO at 42. 8 and 43. 1 GHz {{in a number of}} Mira variable stars over a substantial fraction of their pulsation periods. These observations were part of an observing program that also includes interferometric measurements at 2. 2 and 3. 6 micron Mennesson 2002; comparison of the results from different wavelengths allows studying the envelope independently of the poorly known distances to these stars. Nine stars were observed at from one to four epochs during 2001. The SiO emission is largely confined to rings which are smaller than the inner radius of the dust <b>shells</b> <b>reported</b> by Danchi 1994. Two stars (U Orionis, R Aquarii) have maser rings with diameters corresponding {{to the size of the}} hot molecular layer as measured at 3. 6 micron; in the other cases, the SiO rings are substantially larger. Variations of ring diameter for most, but not all stars, had an rms amplitude in agreement with the models of Humphreys 2002 although the expected relationship between the diameter and pulsation phase was not seen. The ring diameter in U Orionis shows remarkably small variation. A correlation between the 2. 2 / 3. 6 mum diameter ratio with that of the SiO/ 3. 6 mum diameter ratio is likely due to differences in the opacities at 2. 2 and 3. 6 mum in a molecular layer. A further correlation with the inner size of the dust <b>shell</b> <b>reported</b> by Danchi 1994 suggest some differences in the temperature structure. Clear evidence is seen in R Aquarii for an equatorial disk similar to that reported by Hollis 2001; rotation is possibly also detected in S Coronae Boralis...|$|R
30|$|ZnO-coated ZnS:Mn {{nanoparticles}} {{have been}} prepared by different groups [23, 27]; however, the ZnO <b>shells</b> <b>reported</b> in these literatures are of rather poor crystallinity, which is indicated by their X-ray diffraction (XRD) results. Usually, the ZnO shell with higher crystallinity will produce stress on the ZnS:Mn because of the lattice mismatch, and bring efficient luminescent transitions inducing enhanced luminescence [28]. In this paper, a convenient route to prepare higher crystallinity core/shell structural ZnS:Mn/ZnO nanoparticles is reported, {{with the emphasis on}} the improved luminescence properties brought by the ZnO capping on the ZnS:Mn nanoparticles. The shell material, ZnO, is a wide band gap semiconductor with excellent chemical and thermal stability. Therefore, surface modification of ZnS:Mn nanoparticles by ZnO shell is expected to have a passivating effect on the surface states of ZnS:Mn, which would result in enhanced luminescence.|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} initial {{experiences with}} a new assurance service: the verification of sustainability reports providing assertions regarding financial, environmental, and social issues. For illustration purposes, references to the verification of The <b>Shell</b> <b>Report</b> 2000 are made. Because of the new content and format of sustainability reports, established standards for reporting and verification are not yet available. Therefore, applying specifically developed criteria is inevitable. In this article, examples and characteristics of criteria that are needed to evaluate management assertions regarding sustainability are described. Furthermore, verification procedures {{that can be used}} and the content and design of a conclusion on a sustainabilty audit are described. It can be concluded that the verification of sustainability reports is a very challenging assurance service for financial auditors. Academics should be challenged as well, because of the need for further research in this area...|$|R

5000|$|A {{critical}} {{measure of}} the viability of extraction of shale oil lies in {{the ratio of the}} energy produced by the oil shale to the energy used in its mining and processing, a ratio known as [...] "Energy Returned on Energy Invested" [...] (EROEI).
