5|$|Bertha's broad {{circulation}} produced high waves {{which were}} reported along the southeastern {{coast of the}} United States, in North Carolina, the storm produced waves of 25–50ft (7.6-15.2m). The waves caused minor beach erosion along the North Carolina coastline including the Outer Banks. In Florida, rip currents from Bertha caused two drowning fatalities. 200other swimmers were rescued from the rough seas. The vortex of Bertha forced warm air and blocked sea breezes from South Florida. As a result, record high temperatures were reported in West Palm Beach, Miami, Hollywood, and Miami Beach; temperatures also tied records in Fort Lauderdale. The extreme heat also shattered numerous <b>sliding</b> <b>glass</b> doors and exhausted several air conditioners.|$|E
5|$|This led {{to further}} {{complications}} in the writing process. For a few days, {{it was thought that}} Monk and Dr. Kroger would work to solve the case, but upon realizing that Monk {{would not be able to}} go back to a clinical detachment with Dr. Kroger, they eliminated this idea. So instead, Dr. Kroger does appear in more scenes than he normally does, but he stays out of the investigation scenes. As a result, Monk and Dr. Kroger do not break into Francis Merrigan's office to snoop around, though that would have been the typical thing to do if someone else were there. Rather, they simply peer through the <b>sliding</b> <b>glass</b> door that opens from Merrigan's office into the courtyard.|$|E
40|$|Silver {{and copper}} nanoparticles, respectively, were {{produced}} on <b>glass</b> <b>slides</b> via magnetron sputtering. The experiments show that with magnetron sputtering {{the size and}} concentration of the nanoparticles can be easily controlled via sputter time and plasma power. Silver nanoparticles grow much faster than copper nanoparticles, which also require higher plasma power for their synthesis. Exposed to albumin solution, the <b>glass</b> <b>slides</b> with silver nanoparticles clearly show a delay in albumin attachment compared to pure <b>glass</b> <b>slides.</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>slides</b> with copper nanoparticles show a slight attachment of albumin even after 3 [*]h of exposure.

40|$|Abstract A novel route was {{introduced}} to synthesize dense polyacrylamide (PAM) onto the <b>glass</b> <b>slide</b> surface. To in-vestigate the surface chemistry of the PAM on the <b>glass</b> <b>slides,</b> X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to obtain detailed chemical state information on the PAM layer constituents. The XPS peak data {{were consistent with the}} presented model of the PAM on the <b>glass</b> <b>slide</b> surface. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscope data indicated the presence of PAM on the <b>glass</b> <b>slides,</b> which consist of nodules. The results showed that PAM was successfully immobilized onto <b>glass</b> <b>slides</b> with a two-tier structure under aqueous condition and a monolayer structure under anhydrous condition. Compared with those under aqueous condition, the controllability of the molecular layer on <b>glass</b> <b>slides</b> and the reproducibility under anhy-drous condition were much better, which makes anhydrous condition an advisable condition {{for the study of the}} reac-tion mechanisms of <b>glass</b> <b>slides</b> modified by PAM...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} here a new microquantiWcation {{method of}} L-phenylalanine concentration in an extract from a dried blood spot {{by using the}} diaphorase–resazurin system. To miniaturize the Xuorometric enzymatic microplate assay for the diagnosis of phenylketonuria, an enzyme chip immobilized with His-tag fused phenylalanine dehydrogenase (PheDH) was developed. His-tag fused PheDH was immobi-lized {{on the surface of}} nickel-coated <b>slide</b> <b>glass.</b> A microarray sheet (8 £ 30 well) was fabricated with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) using the photolithographic technique. An enzyme reaction chamber in a double-layered structure was constructed with diVerent types of microarray PDMS sheets on the surface of Ni-coated <b>slide</b> <b>glass</b> immobilized with His-tagged PheDH. To evaluate the aYnity toward the Ni-chelating ligand, eight kinds of His-tagged PheDH variants were constructed and expressed. (His) 6 - and (His) 9 -PheDH variants at the N terminus showed high adsorption ratio to Ni-chelating ligand. The Vmax and kcat values of the (His) 6 -PheDH variant at the N terminus for L-phenylalanine were higher than those of the (His) 9 -PheDH variant, and the (His) 6 -PheDH variant was found to be most suitable for immobilization onto nickel-coated <b>slide</b> <b>glass.</b> Fluorescence formed by resazurin-coupled enzymatic reaction (in a 0. 2 -l reaction mixture) on the enzyme chip exhibited good linearity and a correlation coeYcient up to 12. 8 mg/dl of the L-phenylalanine-containing sample extracted from a dried blood spot on Wlter paper...|$|R

Because the spree was happening {{so early in}} the fall semester, some students withdrew their enrollment or transferred to other schools. Twenty-three year old Tracy Paules was living with Manny Taboada, also 23, her burly 200lb roommate. On Monday, August 27, Rolling broke into the apartment by prying open the <b>sliding</b> <b>glass</b> door with the same tools he had used previously.

30|$|To {{fabricate}} {{the sensor}} array, a <b>slide</b> <b>glass</b> covered with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was prepared as a stiff substrate. The PVDF thin film covered by Al {{on both sides}} was loaded on the substrate. Then, the photoresist was spin-coated {{on the surface of}} the film with a speed of 3000  rpm for 40  s. After photolithography and wet etching of Al by a mask aligner system (ABM, Inc., USA), the 16 capacitor units with 4 [*]×[*] 4 square structure were prepared. After that, the flexible sensor on the PDMS substrate was picked up from the <b>slide</b> <b>glass.</b> The electrodes of each capacitor were connected with the conductive wires through silver glue. In order to obtain good bio-compatibility, the sensor was packaged by being covered with PDMS on the top and heated for 12  h at 60  °C.

40|$|In this research, a {{localized}} surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) immunosensor {{based on}} gold-capped nanoparticle substrate for detecting casein, {{one of the}} most potent allergens in milk, was developed. The fabrication of the gold-capped nanoparticle substrate involved a surface-modified silica nanoparticle layer (core) on the <b>slide</b> <b>glass</b> substrate between bottom and top gold layers (shell). The absorbance peak of the gold-capped nanoparticle substrate was observed at ~ 520 nm. In addition, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images demonstrated that the nanoparticles formed a monolayer on the <b>slide</b> <b>glass.</b> After immobilizing anti-casein antibody on the surface, our device, casein immunosensor, could be applied easily for the detection of casein in the raw milk sample without a difficult pretreatment. Under the optimum conditions, the detection limit of the casein immunosensor was determined as 10 ng/mL.

25|$|Glass doors {{pose the}} risk of unintentional {{collision}} if a person believes the door to be open when it is closed, or is unaware there is a door at all. This risk may be particularly pronounced with <b>sliding</b> <b>glass</b> doors because they often have large single panes which are hard to see. To prevent injury from glass doors, stickers or other types of warnings are sometimes placed on the glass surface {{to make it more}} visible. For instance, in the UK, Regulation 14 of the Workplace (Health and Safety Regulations) 1992 requires the marking of windows and glass doors to make them conspicuous. Australian Standards: AS1288 and AS2208 require glass doors to be made from laminated or toughened glass.|$|E
25|$|A day later, on Saturday, August 25, Rolling {{broke into}} the {{apartment}} where 18-year-old Christa Hoyt lived by prying open a <b>sliding</b> <b>glass</b> door with a KA-BAR knife and a screwdriver, {{but she was not}} home. He waited in the living room for her to return. At 11 a.m. she entered the apartment and Rolling surprised her from behind, placing her in a choke-hold. After she had been subdued, he taped her mouth shut, bound her wrists together and led her into the bedroom, where he cut the clothes from her body and raped her. As in the Powell murder, he forced her face-down and stabbed her in the back, rupturing her heart. He then decapitated the body and posed her head on a shelf facing the corpse, adding to the shock of whoever discovered her.|$|E
25|$|Stripe-patterned polymer films can {{be formed}} on solid {{substrates}} by casting diluted polymer solution. This method is relatively easy, inexpensive, {{and has no}} restriction on the scaffold materials that can be used. The procedure involves horizontally overlapping glass plates while keeping them vertically separated by a narrow gap filled with a polymer solution. The upper plate is moved at a constant velocity between 60 and 100µm/s. A thin liquid film of solution is continuously formed {{at the edge of}} the <b>sliding</b> <b>glass</b> following evaporation of the solvent. Stripe patterns prepared at speeds of 60, 70, and 100µm/s created width and groove spacings of 2.2 and 6.1µm, 3.6 and 8.4µm, and 4.3 and 12.7µm, respectively; the range of heights for the ridges was 50–100nm. Tsuruma, Tanaka et al. demonstrated that embryonic neural cells cultured on film coated with poly-L-lysine attached and elongated parallel to poly(ε-caprolactone)/chloroform solution (1g/L) stripes with narrow pattern width and spacing (width: 2.2µm, spacing: 6.1µm). However, the neurons grew across the axis of the patterns with wide width and spacing (width: 4.3µm, spacing: 12.7µm). On average, the neurons on the stripe-patterned films had less neurites per cell and longer neurites compared to the neurons on non-patterned films. Thus, the stripe pattern parameters are able to determine the growth direction, the length of neurites, and the number of neurites per cell.|$|E
40|$|Candida albicans IFO 1385 yeast cells dominantly develop germ {{tubes in}} a dilute corn meal broth at 37 ˚C. For germ tube (GT) {{development}} the broth concentration is optimal at 75 % of the original, and the inoculum is optimal at 105 cells/mL. Incubation proce-dures were compared and the non-slip <b>slide</b> <b>glass</b> incubation (NSSI) method {{was found to}} be more available than the tube incubation method or slid-covered <b>slide</b> <b>glass</b> incu-bation method. The GT formation was completed in 1 to 2 h in the NSSI method and clear-cut GTs were observed under optical microscopy. GTs were formed in all 111 test-strains of C. albicans but not at all in other species of Candida. Therefore, under optimal conditions, the rate of identifying C. albicans is 100 %, demonstrating that GT detection with the NSSI method is a rapid and reliable identification method. The humid NSSI method is suited for continuous observation of a GT. The initially formed GT elongated to resemble a true hypha, attaching no chlamydoconidium. The hypha subsequently dissociated yeast-like cells. Key words: Candida albicans; corn meal broth; germ tube formation; non-slip <b>slide</b> <b>glass</b> incubation method Since the germ tube (GT) is a characteristic morphology observed only in C. albicans, con-firmation of GT is available as a rapid method for identifying C. albicans.
