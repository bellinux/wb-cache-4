5000|$|One form {{is direct}} {{sequence}} spread spectrum (DS-CDMA), used {{for example in}} 3G cell phone systems. Each information bit (or each symbol) is represented by a long code sequence of several pulses, called chips. The sequence is the <b>spreading</b> <b>code,</b> and each message signal (for example each phone call) uses a different <b>spreading</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
5000|$|All WaveLAN devices {{utilize the}} same <b>spreading</b> <b>code</b> in their DSSS scheme, so a WaveLAN card in {{promiscuous}} mode {{and set to}} ignore the NWID parameter could sniff and decode any WaveLAN radio traffic it encountered.|$|E
5000|$|A special form of DSFN is Continuous Transmission DSFN, {{where all}} base station {{transmitters}} always transmit at full power, without blocking of non-utilized transmitters, and without power control. This concept {{is very similar}} to so called Virtual cellular networks (VCNs), where a virtual cell is a group of base stations sending using the same <b>spreading</b> <b>code,</b> or a group of OFDM transmitters form a Single Frequency Network.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} <b>spreading</b> <b>codes</b> in DWT based MC-CDMA wireless communication system is investigated. In this paper, we present the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of different <b>spreading</b> <b>codes</b> (Walsh-Hadamard code, Orthogonal gold code and Golay complementary sequences) using Forward Error Correction (FEC) {{of the proposed}} system. The data is analyzed and is compared among different <b>spreading</b> <b>codes</b> in both coded and uncoded cases. It is found via computer simulation that {{the performance of the}} proposed coded system is much better than that of the uncoded system irrespective of the <b>spreading</b> <b>codes</b> and all the <b>spreading</b> <b>codes</b> show approximately similar nature for both coded and uncoded in all modulation schemes.

30|$|To {{combat the}} {{interference}} incurred {{by its own}} transmission, the <b>spreading</b> <b>codes</b> in the CDD device have the following assignment policy: the <b>spreading</b> <b>codes</b> of the uplink and downlink are wisely chosen to belong to different sets of Walsh-Hadamard. The benefit of this assignment is that the <b>spreading</b> <b>codes</b> between the uplink and downlink have the maximum width of the IFW, which can guarantee the orthogonality between the uplink and downlink in one CDD node so that their mutual interference can be negligible.|$|R
50|$|In the UMTS {{cellular}} communication system, received {{signal code}} power (RSCP) denotes the power {{measured by a}} receiver on a particular physical communication channel. It is used {{as an indication of}} signal strength, as a handover criterion, in downlink power control, and to calculate path loss. In CDMA systems, a physical channel corresponds to a particular <b>spreading</b> <b>code,</b> hence the name (Received signal code power). RSCP is also called Receiver Side Call Power.|$|E
50|$|In these systems, {{the symbol}} {{rate of the}} {{physically}} transmitted high-frequency signal rate is called chip rate, which also is the pulse rate of the equivalent base band signal. However, in spread spectrum systems, the term symbol may also be used at a higher layer and refer to one information bit, or a block of information bits that are modulated using for example conventional QAM modulation, before the CDMA <b>spreading</b> <b>code</b> is applied. Using the latter definition, the symbol rate is equal to or lower than the bit rate.|$|E
50|$|Another form is {{frequency}}-hopping (FH-CDMA), {{where the}} channel frequency is changing very rapidly {{according to a}} sequence that constitutes the <b>spreading</b> <b>code.</b> As an example, the Bluetooth communication system {{is based on a}} combination of frequency-hopping and either CSMA/CA statistical time division multiplexing communication (for data communication applications) or TDMA (for audio transmission). All nodes belonging to the same user (to the same virtual private area network or piconet) use the same frequency hopping sequence synchronously, meaning that they send on the same frequency channel, but CDMA/CA or TDMA is used to avoid collisions within the VPAN. Frequency-hopping is used to reduce the cross-talk and collision probability between nodes in different VPANs.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we aim at}} {{solving the}} problem of joint delay {{estimation}} and data detection of the orthogonal modulated signals in the asynchronous DS-CDMA system employing aperiodic long <b>spreading</b> <b>codes</b> over fading channels. The general system requirement of low error rate in data demodulation necessitates the reliable synchronization mechanisms. Synchronization of CDMA signals with long <b>spreading</b> <b>codes</b> is a more challenging task than that of CDMA signals with short <b>spreading</b> <b>codes.</b> In this work, two algorithms are introduced to perform acquisition and tracking of orthogonal modulated signals with long <b>spreading</b> <b>codes,</b> followed by data detection. The numerical results show that when applying to the asynchronous system with random propagation delays, the proposed algorithms approximate the performance that is attainable in the synchronized and chip-aligned system...|$|R

50|$|Spread {{spectrum}} can {{be considered}} as an alternative to complex DCA algorithms. Spread spectrum avoids cochannel interference between adjacent cells, since the probability that users in nearby cells use the same <b>spreading</b> <b>code</b> is insignificant. Thus the frequency channel allocation problem is relaxed in cellular networks based on a combination of spread spectrum and FDMA, for example IS95 and 3G systems. Spread spectrum also facilitate that centrally controlled base stations dynamically borrow resources from each other depending on the traffic load, simply by increasing the maximum allowed number of simultaneous users in one cell (the maximum allowed interference level from the users in the cell), and decreasing it in an adjacent cell. Users in the overlap between the base station coverage area can be transferred between the cells (called cell-breathing), or the traffic can be regulated by admission control and traffic-shaping.|$|E
5000|$|Resistance to eavesdropping. The <b>spreading</b> <b>code</b> (in DS systems) or the frequency-hopping pattern (in FH systems) {{is often}} unknown by anyone {{for whom the}} signal is unintended, in which case it obscures the signal and reduces the chance of an adversary's making sense of it. Moreover, for a given noise power {{spectral}} density (PSD), spread-spectrum systems require {{the same amount of}} energy per bit before spreading as narrowband systems and therefore the same amount of power if the bitrate before spreading is the same, but since the signal power is spread over a large bandwidth, the signal PSD is much lower [...] - [...] often significantly lower than the noise PSD [...] - [...] so that the adversary may be unable to determine whether the signal exists at all. However, for mission-critical applications, particularly those employing commercially available radios, spread-spectrum radios do not intrinsically provide adequate security; [...] "...just using spread-spectrum radio itself is not sufficient for communications security".|$|E
50|$|Like MC-CDMA, CI-OFDM spreads each {{data symbol}} in the {{frequency}} domain. That is, each data symbol is carried over multiple OFDM subcarriers. But unlike MC-CDMA, which uses binary-phase Hadamard codes (code values of 0 or 180 degrees) or binary pseudonoise, CI codes are complex-valued orthogonal codes. In the simplest case, CI code values are coefficients of a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. Each row or column of the DFT matrix provides an orthogonal CI <b>spreading</b> <b>code</b> which spreads a data symbol. Spreading is achieved by multiplying a vector of data symbols by the DFT matrix to produce a vector of coded data symbols, then each coded data symbol is mapped to an OFDM subcarrier via an input bin of an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). A block of contiguous subcarriers may be selected, or to achieve better frequency diversity, non-contiguous subcarriers distributed over a wide frequency band can be used. A guard interval, such as a cyclic prefix (CP), {{is added to the}} baseband CI-OFDM signal before the signal is processed by a radio front-end to convert it to an RF signal, which is then transmitted by an antenna.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of a CDMA based wireless system is largely dependent {{on the characteristics of}} pseudo-random <b>spreading</b> <b>codes.</b> The <b>spreading</b> <b>codes</b> should be carefully chosen to ensure highest possible peak value of auto-correlation function and lower correlation peaks (side-lobes) at non-zero time-shifts.

But no such code family exists which possess both characteristics simultaneously. That's why an exhaustive effort has been made in this paper to evaluate the peak correlation characteristics of various non-orthogonal <b>spreading</b> <b>codes</b> and suggest a suitable solution.

5000|$|CDMA is a {{spread-spectrum}} multiple-access technique. A spread-spectrum technique spreads the bandwidth of {{the data}} uniformly for the same transmitted power. A <b>spreading</b> <b>code</b> is a pseudo-random code that has a narrow ambiguity function, unlike other narrow pulse codes. In CDMA a locally generated code runs {{at a much higher}} rate than the data to be transmitted. Data for transmission is combined by bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) with the faster code.

40|$|Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is a {{technique}} in which transmission of information takes place simultaneously over the same available channel bandwidth. CDMA systems make use of spread spectrum (SS) technique for transmission of information by employing spreading codes.
