25|$|The term {{diagenesis}} is used {{to describe}} all the chemical, physical, and biological changes, exclusive of surface weathering, undergone by a sediment after its initial deposition. Some of those processes cause the sediment to consolidate into a compact, <b>solid</b> <b>substance</b> from the originally loose material. Young sedimentary rocks, especially those of Quaternary age (the most recent period of the geologic time scale) are often still unconsolidated. As sediment deposition builds up, the overburden (lithostatic) pressure rises, and {{a process known as}} lithification takes place.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the friction and interlocking (dilatancy) components of strength, the structure and fabric also {{play a significant role}} in the soil behavior. [...] The structure and fabric include factors such as the spacing and arrangement of the solid particles or the amount and spatial distribution of pore water; in some cases cementitious material accumulates at particle-particle contacts. Mechanical behavior of soil is affected by the density of the particles and their structure or arrangement of the particles as well as the amount and spatial distribution of fluids present (e.g., water and air voids). Other factors include the electrical charge of the particles, chemistry of pore water, chemical bonds (i.e. cementation -particles connected through a <b>solid</b> <b>substance</b> such as recrystallized calcium carbonate) ...|$|E

60|$|Now, as to {{the light}} of the candle. We will light one or two, and set them at work in the {{performance}} of their proper functions. You observe a candle is a very different thing from a lamp. With a lamp you take a little oil, fill your vessel, put in a little moss or some cotton prepared by artificial means, and then light the top of the wick. When the flame runs down the cotton to the oil, it gets extinguished, but it goes on burning in the part above. Now, I have no doubt you will ask, how is it that the oil, which will not burn of itself, gets {{up to the top of}} the cotton, where it will burn? We shall presently examine that; but there is a much more wonderful thing about the burning of a candle than this. You have here a <b>solid</b> <b>substance</b> with no vessel to contain it; and how is it that this <b>solid</b> <b>substance</b> can get up to the place where the flame is? How is it that this solid gets there, it not being a fluid? or, when it is made a fluid, then how is it that it keeps together? This is a wonderful thing about a candle.|$|E
