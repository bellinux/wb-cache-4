5|$|A {{direct method}} for {{producing}} an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique {{to identify the}} globally optimal alignment solution. For proteins, this method usually involves two sets of parameters: a gap penalty and a substitution matrix assigning scores or probabilities to the alignment of each possible pair of amino acids based on the similarity of the amino acids' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation. For nucleotide sequences a similar gap penalty is used, but a much simpler substitution matrix, wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered, is typical. The <b>scores</b> <b>in</b> the substitution matrix may be either all positive or a mix {{of positive and negative}} {{in the case of a}} global alignment, but must be both positive and negative, in the case of a local alignment.|$|E

5|$|According to Kaga, upon release Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light {{received}} extensive {{criticism from}} Japanese publications, with many noting {{that it was}} difficult to understand and had fairly poor graphics, awarding it low <b>scores.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, popular opinion was more positive: in a poll taken by Family Computer Magazine, the game scored 23.48 points out of 30. Likewise, sales of the game were flat for the first two months of sales, but improved after word of mouth had spread.

As of 2002, Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light had sold 329,087 units, being the third best-selling title in the series to that date.|$|E

5|$|Another {{assessment}} system, Chessmetrics, {{calculates that}} Gossip's highest rating was 2470 (number 50 in the world) in April 1889.
