5|$|Varma {{read about}} <b>steadicam</b> in American Cinematographer, and enquired about the {{possibility}} of a similar camera in India. After learning that <b>steadicam</b> was available in Chennai for four years and was already obsolete, Varma decided to use it despite Gopala Reddy's apprehension. Varma chose Rasool Ellore over Rajiv Menon and Deenpal to assist Gopala Reddy with the <b>steadicam.</b> Principal photography began on 16 February 1989, and wrapped in 55 working days. Except for three days in Chennai, the film was shot in Andhra Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|The video, which debuted online on March 1, was {{produced}} by the record label, Spinefarm, and Kalmah. The camera and <b>Steadicam</b> operator was Markus Lintu, and Kalmah's bassist, Timo Lehtinen, edited and color-timed the final product.|$|E
5|$|Birdy was {{the first}} feature film to be {{partially}} shot with the Skycam, a computer-controlled, cable-suspended camera system created by Garrett Brown, inventor of the <b>Steadicam.</b> The Skycam had 100-foot high posts with four hanging wires controlled by a computer, and a lightweight Panavision camera with 200 feet of film hung {{at the center of}} the wires. The filmmakers intended to use the Skycam to fully depict Birdy's point of view during a fantasy sequence in which he imagines himself flying. However, they encountered difficulties with the Skycam, which would often malfunction. Although the Skycam proved successful on its first take, Parker insisted that the filmed footage be shot more rapidly. However, the camera system malfunctioned during its second take, after capturing 40 seconds of footage. This resulted in the camera operators shooting the remainder of the sequence with a <b>Steadicam</b> mounted on top of an improvised camera dolly.|$|E

25|$|The {{television}} {{coverage of the}} tournament was unprecedented. For the first time, all matches were produced in high definition, with in-goal cameras and two <b>steadicams</b> being used for all matches. For selected matches, the broadcast production comprised up to 18 cameras, including a spidercam and a helicopter camera.|$|R
50|$|Anatoly Ivanov was {{the only}} crew to shoot video and record sound for the film, {{carrying}} all the cinema equipment on himself. He eschewed the use of dollies, cranes, jibs, <b>steadicams,</b> tripods, sliders and car mounts and shot Kvadrat exclusively with a handheld rig. No additional lighting was used either.|$|R
5|$|For {{slow motion}} scenes like with bullets and drops of water, twin Phantom {{high-speed}} cameras were used which filmed 200 frames per second. A fight scene with Wesker and Chris in the Resident Evil 5 game was recreated shot-by-shot {{for the film}} and the Phantom cameras were used to create Wesker's superhuman speed which took about two days to film. The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers {{were not able to}} use existing equipment such as <b>Steadicam</b> rigs. Instead the camera operator worked on a Segway to achieve the look of a <b>Steadicam</b> shot. Much of the action scenes were shot in front of a green screen. A 1983 Yak-52 was used throughout the film by Jovovich and Larter. Stunt pilot Martin Mattes was dressed like Jovovich and flew the plane for the camera.|$|E
5|$|Tangier, Morocco, {{doubled as}} Mombasa, where Cobb hires Eames and Yusuf. A foot chase {{was shot in}} the streets and alleyways of the {{historic}} medina quarter. To capture this sequence, Pfister employed a mix of hand-held camera and <b>steadicam</b> work. Tangier was also used to film an important riot scene during the initial foray into Saito's mind.|$|E
5|$|I {{remember}} {{most of the}} video you had shot with the crane, some <b>Steadicam,</b> plus some panning. So you have about five different cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit like crazy. It gives {{you a lot of}} freedom, but I feel very frustrated because I like to see somebody dancing. I hate when there's too much editing. I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E
50|$|Since much of {{the series}} is seen from the hosts' point of view, <b>Steadicams</b> were used to film the whole first season, except {{for a couple of}} scenes in the last episode, where a {{handheld}} camera was used as a metaphor for hosts who broke free from their programming and acted of their own free will.|$|R
5|$|Siva, which {{attained}} cult {{status in}} Telugu cinema, {{is one of}} the first Telugu films produced after the migration of Telugu film industry from Madras to Hyderabad to feature characters speaking the Telangana dialect. The film made Nagarjuna a superstar in Telugu cinema; it changed his career, and earned him a reputation for encouraging new directors. Nagarjuna considered Siva a milestone in his personal life as well since he and Amala, who were in a relationship during the film's shoot, decided to marry after its completion. According to filmmaker V. V. Vinayak and writer Pulagam Chinnarayana, Siva divided Telugu cinema into two eras: before and after the film. With Siva, Varma was credited with the introduction of <b>steadicams</b> and new sound recording techniques in Telugu films. Within a year of the film's release, more than ten <b>steadicams</b> were imported into India. Siva attracted the young audience during its theatrical run, and its success encouraged filmmakers to explore a variety of themes and make experimental Telugu films.|$|R
50|$|Filming {{began on}} March 10, 2014 in Vancouver and {{continued}} through May 5. On March 11, 2014 filming at the Hotel Vancouver commenced. Anamorphic lenses and minimal use of <b>steadicams</b> {{were employed to}} provide greater authenticity for scenes set in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. The films Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire served as inspiration for the period color tone and saturation.|$|R
5|$|Scott avoided using green screens unless necessary. Instead, he used various items so {{the actors}} would {{know where they}} should be looking in any {{particular}} scene on the practical sets where CGI elements would be inserted in post-production. Rapace said that green screens were used fewer than six times during filming. The production used five 3ality Technical Atom 3D rigs, four of which were configured with Red Epic 3D cameras set on camera dollies and tripods, which were continuously in use during filming. The fifth rig used an Epic camera as a <b>steadicam,</b> which was used only occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Siva, which {{attained}} cult status, {{is considered}} Nagarjuna's breakthrough film. It {{is credited with}} the introduction of <b>steadicam</b> and new sound recording techniques in Telugu cinema, encouraging filmmakers to explore a variety of themes and make experimental films. For the April 2013 centennial of Indian cinema, CNN-News18 included Siva on its list of 100 greatest Indian films of all time. Its Tamil-dubbed version, Udhayam, was also successful. Varma remade the film twice in Hindi with the same title. The first, starring Nagarjuna, Amala and Raghuvaran, performed well at the box office, but the second, with Mohit Ahlawat and Priyanka Kothari, did not.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the school was shot using the left wing of the then-abandoned Church of Saint Mary the Virgin building almost directly opposite the real school on West 46th Street in Times Square. The Rocky Horror Picture Show midnight screening sequence was filmed at the 8th Playhouse located on 52 West 8th Street, New York. Sal Piro, president of The Rocky Horror Picture Show Fan Club, appears as an emcee at the screening. Parker later hired <b>Steadicam</b> inventor and operator Garrett Brown to film Doris and Ralph's dialogue scene in a New York City Subway station. Montgomery MacNeil's apartment was located on 1564 Broadway and West 46th Street, Manhattan.|$|E
5000|$|I still recall Varma okaying {{my first}} shot, though I forgot to utter my line. He {{was of the}} opinion that I {{conveyed}} what I needed to, through a gesture. Post the shot, he {{came to me and said}} that it’s better I forget putting pen to paper, only for me to realise later that I would become a busy actor. —Bharani during the film's silver jubilee.

500|$|Influenced by the 1985 {{documentary}} film Shoah, Spielberg {{decided not to}} plan the film with storyboards, and to shoot it like a documentary. Forty percent of the film was shot with handheld cameras, and the modest budget meant the film was shot quickly over seventy-two days. Spielberg felt that this gave the film [...] "a spontaneity, an edge, and it also serves the subject." [...] He filmed without using <b>Steadicams,</b> elevated shots, or zoom lenses, [...] "everything that for me might be considered a safety net." [...] This matured Spielberg, who felt {{that in the past}} he had always been paying tribute to directors such as Cecil B. DeMille or David Lean.|$|R
50|$|To achieve this, {{a number}} of {{components}} from hardware to software need to be combined. Software collects all of the {{6 degrees of freedom}} movement of the camera as well as metadata such as zoom, focus, iris and shutter elements from many different types of hardware devices, ranging from motion capture systems such as active LED marker based system from PhaseSpace, passive systems such as Motion Analysis or Vicon, to rotary encoders fitted to camera cranes and dollies such as Technocranes and Fisher Dollies, or inertia & gyroscopic sensors mounted directly to the camera. There are also laser based tracking systems that can be attached to anything, including <b>Steadicams,</b> to track cameras outside in the rain at distances of up to 30 meters.|$|R
5|$|Parker {{initially}} {{turned down}} an opportunity to direct, believing that the complex book could not be successfully adapted for a feature film. The project resurfaced in 1982 when A Films, a newly established film division of A Records, acquired the film rights and commissioned Sandy Kroopf and Jack Behr to write the script. Upon reading the script, Parker returned as the film's director, and the project continued development at Tri-Star Pictures. The film's principal photography began in May 1984 and concluded in August of that year. Filming took place on locations in Philadelphia and Santa Clara, California. Birdy is notable for being the first film to be partially shot with the Skycam, a computer-controlled camera system created by <b>Steadicam</b> inventor Garrett Brown. The score was composed by Peter Gabriel, who used recorded material from previous albums for individual scenes in the film.|$|E
5|$|Netflix {{required}} the production to shoot with 4K cameras {{to make the}} look of the show future-proof and John Toll who is credited as the main director of photography for overseeing the distinct look of the nine featured locations, made the decision to shoot by using mostly Sony's CineAlta PMW-F55 cameras, paired with Carl Zeiss Ultra Prime and Cooke Optics S4 lenses. During the first season, Toll, once again collaborating with the Wachowskis and Glass after Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending, personally handled the cinematography in San Francisco, Chicago, London, Iceland, and Seoul. Toll's approach to shooting was to use a lot of <b>Steadicam</b> and hand-held partly out of the necessity to follow the faster schedule of a television production compared to the feature films he was used to working on. Additional cinematographers worked {{with the rest of the}} directors in the remaining locations and they used a similar shooting style because they were facing the same scheduling challenges. McTeigue's cinematographer of choice for shooting in Mexico City and Mumbai was Danny Ruhlmann, who previously shot The Raven and Survivor for him. Tykwer worked with Frank Griebe and Christian Almesberger for the Berlin and Nairobi scenes respectively. Griebe had previously shot seven feature films of Tykwer's including Cloud Atlas and Almesberger was the cinematographer of two films Tykwer had produced in Nairobi: Soul Boy and Nairobi Half Life.|$|E
5|$|The episodes took {{seventeen}} days to film, where normally crew {{are given}} eight days to film a week's worth of episodes. Between forty and forty-five members of crew were required for filming the fire episode, including assistant directors, a design department, cameras, lighting, sound, make up, costume, visual effects, fire safety officers and a stunt team {{consisting of a}} stunt co-ordinator and stunt doubles. Filming was done with four television cameras, a <b>steadicam</b> and a dolly. The exterior fire scenes were filmed first, in five night shoots lasting until 4a.m., and the real exterior set was burnt. Safety was the top priority for the fire scenes, and fire safety advisors ensured all cast and crew were protected. Stunt doubles wore flame-proof gel on their faces and for the scene where Ryan and Stacey fall from the ladder, several layers of cardboard boxes were stacked {{on the ground for}} the stunt doubles to fall onto. For filming the final explosion scene, all the actors whose characters were involved were filmed separately for their reactions. The explosion had to be delayed due to a power failure at Elstree Studios, two minutes before the explosion was due to be set off, which also affected a live broadcast of Big Brother. The power cut lasted two hours and filming was further delayed due to rain. The explosion was completed in a third take. Despite the delay, the scenes were completed on schedule. Salisbury noted that the demise of such an iconic set as The Queen Victoria left several cast members in tears.|$|E
5000|$|... "Bad Boy" [...] {{was filmed}} in a 90s throwback style, using {{360-degree}} rotation-capable MK-V AR <b>Steadicam’s</b> Arri Alexa cameras. The shot {{took place in}} the New York City neighborhood Williamsburg, down by the Marcy Ave JMZ subway entrance. It reached 100 million views on YouTube on December of 2016, making Big Bang the first Korean boy band to have five music videos that have hit over 100 million viewers. Duncan Cooper from The Fader called the video [...] "compelling and refreshingly unforced", writing that the group is [...] "on the ground and they're walking the turf, and for four breezy minutes they're absolutely killing it." [...] Popdust ranked [...] "Bad Boy" [...] fourteen in their list of 20 Best K-pop videos of 2012, commenting that the video [...] "proves that sometimes less really is more." ...|$|R
500|$|Gray and cinematographer Wally Pfister worked {{together}} to develop a visual style for the film before production began. They viewed car commercials and magazine photographs, as well as chase sequences from The French Connection (1971), Ronin (1998), and The Bourne Identity (2002) as visual references. Pfister wanted [...] "dark textures and undertones and strong contrast"; he collaborated with production designer Charlie Wood on the color palette, and the two would confer with Gray on their ideas. Paramount preferred that The Italian Job not be shot in the anamorphic format, despite Pfister's wishes to do so. Gray wanted a widescreen aspect ratio, so they chose to shoot the film in Super 35 for a 2.4:1 aspect ratio. Once principal photography began, Gray frequently utilized dollies, as well as <b>Steadicams</b> and a Technocrane, to keep the cameras almost constantly moving.|$|R
500|$|... "Vienen" [...] {{was shot}} in three locations: a studio in Los Angeles, a closed down CENCO oil {{refinery}} in Santa Fe Springs, and an offshore oil platform in the Pacific Ocean {{off the coast of}} Santa Barbara. During the show's previous seasons, location manager Ilt Jones had been required to scout for locations after scripts were submitted. Starting with the eighth season, however, he was allowed to go on several [...] "scouting roadshow" [...] in order to find new and interesting locations that could be written into scripts. Jones, who discovered the oil platform and the refinery during his first scouting trip, later said the oil platform was [...] "his favorite example" [...] of places he was able to find. Because the platform and refinery were scouted in advance, Jones was given six weeks to prepare the shoota [...] "far cry" [...] from the usual two. This added time also saved the series a considerable amount of money. Filming on the oil platform occurred between sunrise and sunset in one day. The film crew used <b>Steadicams</b> for filming on the oil platform because the decks were slick with oil and, according to Hardy, the cameras [...] "sort of fit and blend in quite well" [...] on the platform.|$|R
25|$|A <b>Steadicam</b> rig was {{employed}} {{during the filming}} of Return of the Jedi, in conjunction with two gyroscopes for extra stabilization, to film the background plates for the speeder bike chase. <b>Steadicam</b> inventor Garrett Brown operated the shot, walking through a redwood forest, running the camera at one frame per second. When projected at 24 frames per second, it {{gave the impression of}} flying through the air at perilous speeds.|$|E
25|$|Carpenter's {{films are}} {{characterized}} by minimalist lighting and photography, static cameras, use of <b>steadicam,</b> and distinctive synthesized scores (usually self-composed).|$|E
25|$|This {{required}} the <b>Steadicam</b> {{to be on}} a special mount modeled on a wheelchair in which the operator sat while pulling a platform with the sound man. The weight of the rig and its occupants proved to be too much for the original tires however, resulting in a blowout one day that almost caused a serious crash. Solid tires were then mounted on the rig. Kubrick also had a highly accurate speedometer mounted on the rig so as to duplicate the exact tempo of a given shot so that Brown could perform take after identical take. Brown also discusses how the scenes in the hedge maze were shot with a <b>Steadicam.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Panavision is {{the most}} common source of {{anamorphic}} lenses, with lens series ranging from 20mm to a 2,000mm anamorphic telescope. The C-Series, which is the oldest lens series, are small and lightweight, which makes them very popular for <b>steadicams.</b> Some cinematographers prefer them to newer lenses because they are lower in contrast. The E-Series, of Nikon glass, are sharper than the C-Series and are better color-matched. They are also faster, but the minimum focus-distance of the shorter focal lengths is not as close. The E135mm, and especially the E180mm, are great close-up lenses with the closest minimum focus of any long Panavision anamorphic lenses. The Super (High) Speed lenses (1976), also by Nikon, are the fastest anamorphic lenses available, with T-stops between 1.4 and 1.8; there is even one T1.1 50mm, but, like all anamorphic lenses, they need to be stopped-down for good performance because they are quite softly focused when wide open. The Primo and Close-Focus Primo Series (1989) are based on the spherical Primos and are the sharpest Panavision anamorphic lenses available. They are completely color-matched, but also very heavy: about 5-7 kilograms. The G-Series (2007), Panavision's latest anamorphic lens series, performance and size comparable with E-Series, in lightweight and compact similar to C-Series.|$|R
500|$|Mendes' {{dominating}} visual {{style was}} deliberate and composed, with a minimalist design that provided [...] "a sparse, almost surreal feeling—a bright, crisp, hard edged, near Magritte-like take on American suburbia"; Mendes constantly directed his set dressers {{to empty the}} frame. He made Lester's fantasy scenes [...] "more fluid and graceful", and Mendes made minimal use of <b>steadicams,</b> feeling that stable shots generated more tension. For example, when Mendes used a slow push in to the Burnhams' dinner table, he held the shot because his training as a theater director taught him the importance of putting distance between the characters. He {{wanted to keep the}} tension in the scene, so he only cut away when Jane left the table. Mendes did use a hand-held camera for the scene in which Col. Fitts beats Ricky. Mendes said the camera provided the scene with a [...] "kinetic off-balance energy". He also went hand-held for the excerpts of Ricky's camcorder footage. Mendes {{took a long time to}} get the quality of Ricky's footage to the level he wanted. For the plastic-bag footage, Mendes used wind machines to move the bag in the air. The scene took four takes; two by the second unit did not satisfy Mendes, so he shot the scene himself. He felt his first take lacked grace, but for the last attempt, he changed the location to the front of a brick wall and added leaves on the ground. Mendes was satisfied by the way the wall gave definition to the outline of the bag.|$|R
500|$|Legion {{was filmed}} with Arri Alexa cameras, with two Alexa XT cameras and an Alexa Mini {{used for the}} pilot and then Minis used {{for the rest of}} the season; the footage was {{captured}} in 4K Ultra-high-definition. Gonzales described the series as [...] "essentially a one-camera show", but [...] "if we can get a bonus view [...] that doesn’t compromise the look of A-camera, that’s great." [...] Lenses for the series were a mixture of spherical and anamorphic, including a 9.8 Kinoptik camera lens to film [...] "some of the more bizarre mindscapes", which Kubrick used to film A Clockwork Orange. The Kinoptik lenses caused vignetting, which Gonzales would crop out of the image in post-production, though sometimes [...] "we just left it" [...] to add character. The series changes aspect ratio to reflect Haller's state of mind, [...] "going narrower when he feels boxed in by the nefarious forces pursuing him", though Gonzales [...] "didn’t always want the anamorphics to make the audience feel this big jump, but I wanted these subtle differences like the background bokeh to be a little different." [...] The season's [...] "memory work" [...] sequences were filmed with anamorphic lenses, but were then cropped to a 16:9 aspect ratio. Gonzales and Hawley both [...] "don’t care too much for" [...] <b>steadicams,</b> and instead relied on jib arms, dollies, and 30-foot technocranes, both on set and location. The production also made extensive use of a Ronin camera stabilizer, allowing the camera to be moved around by camera men and transitioned between hand use and cranes without endangering the camera operators.|$|R
25|$|Production {{took place}} almost {{exclusively}} at EMI Elstree Studios with sets strongly based on real locations. Kubrick often {{worked with a}} small crew which allowed him to do many takes, sometimes to the exhaustion of the actors and staff. The new <b>Steadicam</b> was used in several scenes giving it an innovative and immersive look and feel. Because of inconsistencies, ambiguities, symbolism, and differences from the book, {{there has been much}} speculation into the meanings and actions in the movie.|$|E
25|$|The crew wanted The Raid {{to be shot}} in a quasi-documentary style, that is, {{the camera}} is {{handheld}} and {{without the use of}} <b>Steadicam.</b> To aim such objective, they shot the film in high-definition using Panasonic AF100 camcorderwhich had just recently come out of the market and strayed from using film format while shooting most action and fight sequences. In addition, the camera was frequently attached to a Fig Rig to prevent most scenes from being too jarring, and give the camera operator opportunities to change angles and positions rapidly.|$|E
25|$|Editors Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione were {{involved}} in the project by this stage. When Iñárritu told Mirrone that he planned for Lubezki to record table readings and the rehearsals, he suggested they edit them immediately to discover what was and was not working early on. The editing also allowed the editors to discuss pacing issues with the director, such as the position of the night-day transitions and other moments of rest in the film. Production designer Kevin Thompson was on hand too, and mapped out the scenes. The camerawork required many elements of the set to be built in a certain way. For example, Riggan's makeup mirror and desk were constructed so that the camera would see his reflection. Thompson also took into consideration the needs of the crew, for instance designing the stairs a little wider for <b>Steadicam</b> operator Chris Haarhoff's footsize.|$|E
500|$|In September 2006, Jumper {{was filmed}} at various {{locations}} in Peterborough, Ontario and principal photography began in Toronto in October. In December 2006, Liman {{negotiated with the}} Rome Film Commission for rare access to film for three days in the Colosseum. The scene in the Colosseum was originally written for the Pantheon, at which exterior shots were also filmed. The crew was required to keep equipment off the ground by using harnesses and {{had to rely on}} natural light for filming. Filming took place for 45 minutes in the morning and in the evening so as not to disturb the public touring the amphitheater throughout the day. In order to maximize the short period for filming, four <b>steadicams</b> were set up to ensure time was not wasted in reloading the camera. A visual effects supervisor explained how visual effects were needed for various aspects after filming: [...] "There were three kinds of shots: there were shots where {{they were able to get}} most of what they needed in the Collosseum itself; and then there were shots on a set that needed extensions beyond the limits of the set; and then there were shots where we needed to create the Coliseum basically from scratch." [...] After filming in Rome, scenes were filmed in Toronto during December 2006 to January 2007 and wrapped at the Canadian location on January 19. On January 26 in Toronto, 56-year-old David Ritchie, a set dresser, was fatally struck by frozen debris while dismantling an outdoor set in wintry conditions. Another worker was injured and was sent to a hospital with serious head and shoulder injuries. After Toronto, the cast and crew traveled to Tokyo to film scenes. One scene required over 30 shoots as the scene could only be filmed in between traffic light changes. As a result of director Liman insisting Christensen perform his own stunts, the actor injured his hand, split open his ear, and developed a hyperdilated pupil that required hospital care while filming various scenes. In February 2007, the next filming site was set up at Gallup Park in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Sixty students from the nearby Huron High School were cast as extras for the film. Since additional filming was required of the area, twenty other students were used for a day of filming in September. Altogether, filming took place in 20 cities in 14 countries.|$|R

25|$|Once again, {{following}} on from The Trials of Life, {{the team}} used the latest camera technology and techniques, {{and had to}} travel into territory that had been previously inaccessible to filmmakers. For example, to photograph the wildlife of the sea, boats, divers, suspended capsules and remotely controlled cameras mounted on inflatables were used. Particularly dangerous to divers were leopard seals and other predators, so some underwater sequences necessitated the use of cages for safety. The team also used a small, steel-hulled yacht, the Damien II. It had a retractable keel, which enabled the vessel to venture into shallow bays and land camera crews on to remote islands, where they could remain in contact via radio. A <b>steadicam</b> was used to obtain close-ups of fighting fur seals, with another person carrying a pair of wooden poles close by, in case one of the creatures attacked the human visitors.|$|E
