50|$|Recently, Dr. Tougaw has {{developed}} a Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) device having normal QCA cells {{laid out in a}} planar structure, having a set of input lines and a set of orthogonal output lines. The device has clocking regions that control the flow of binary signals through the device. The input columns are driven by a separate input signal, and all the cells of each column align to match their input signal. These input columns then serve as drivers for output rows that act as <b>serial</b> <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> under the control of clock signals applied to sub-sections of the rows. In this way, a copy of the contents of each of the input signals propagates along each of the output rows to an output cell. The output cells of each output row may be assigned their own, latching clock signal.|$|R

As a workaround, put the external clock signal into the D input of a 74AC74 flip-flop, run the flop's Q output to the 6522's CB1 pin, and clock the flip-flop with Ø0 or Ø2. [...] The <b>serial</b> <b>shift</b> <b>register</b> bug was corrected in the California Micro Devices CMD G65SC22, the Western Design Center W65C22 and in the MOS 6526, the latter device which Commodore used in place of the 6522 from the Commodore 64 onwards.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{diagnosis}} of faults to replaceable units {{at the system}} or board level can be enhanced by selective insertion of <b>serial</b> scan <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> as test points within or between the replaceable units. A systematic approach to the selection of locations for such test points in order to realize a target diagnostic resolution to the replaceable unit level is proposed. The approach {{is based on a}} combination of three models, a structural model for system interconnection and test signal propagation, a syndrome model for system diagnosability analusis, and a probabilistic model for module failure and syndrome occurrence. On the basis of these models, the average number of replaceable units which are projected to be identified as potentially faulty in a diagnosis is formulated as a single parameter diagnostic measure for a system. A test point placement algorithm is presented which makes use of this measure plus a secondary heuristic. The algorithm uses local optimization in the sense that test points are selected one at a time until the replaceable unit diagnosability target is met. The approach is particularly applicable to systems and boards using VLSI chips because of the high ratio of logic circuits to input-output pins and interchip interconnections...|$|R

The yield model is a redundancy design {{in which there is}} a primary loop and a set of secondary loops which can be enabled/disabled without introducing blanks to the data stream. This function has a finite yield, the loop-modification yield factor, which must be greater than 0. 9 to make the system more economical than the simple nonredundant design. It is further established that small loop capacities greatly degrade the yield because of the effect of the modification yield factor, while large loop capacities degrade the yield because of defects in the operating area. As the modification yield increases the optimum loop capacity decreases. An optimum value for the number of redundant loops exists for each loop capacity.

40|$|Abstract—In this brief, an {{efficient}} technique for implementation of soft-error-tolerant <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> is presented. The proposed technique uses two implementations {{of the basic}} registers with different structures operating in parallel. A soft error occurring in either <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> causes the outputs of the <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> to differ, or mismatch, {{for at least one}} sample. The <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> are specifically designed so that, when a soft error occurs, they produce distinct error patterns at the <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> output. An error detection circuit monitors the basic <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> outputs and identifies any mismatches. An error correction circuit determines which <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> is in error based on the mismatch pattern and selects the error-free <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> result as the output of the overall error-protected system. This technique is referred to as structural dual modular redundancy (DMR) since it enhances traditional DMR to provide error correction, as well as error detection, by means of <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> modules with different structures. The proposed technique has been implemented and evaluated. The system achieves a soft error correction rate of close to 100 % for isolated single soft errors and has a logic complexity significantly less than that of conventional triple modular redundancy. This is achieved using a Cadence 180 nm CMOS technology. Index Terms—Dual modular redundancy (DMR), <b>shift</b> <b>registers,</b> finite impulse response (FIR), soft errors...|$|R

Minimality of a linear sequential machine, where these principles are presented from the observability point of view. This approach enables us to develop quick tests for minimality and introduce a different minimization algorithm having definite advantages when dealing with very large machines.
