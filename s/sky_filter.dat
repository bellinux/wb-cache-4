50|$|The {{visibility}} of celestial {{objects in the}} night sky is affected by light pollution. The presence of the Moon {{in the night sky}} has historically hindered astronomical observation by increasing the amount of ambient lighting. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, light pollution has been a growing problem for viewing the night <b>sky.</b> Special <b>filters</b> and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for the best seeing both professional and amateur optical astronomers seek viewing sites located far from major urban areas.|$|R
40|$|In Computer Vision, the sky {{color is}} used for {{lighting}} correction, image color enhancement, horizon alignment, image indexing, and outdoor image classification and in many other applications. In this article, for robust color based sky segmentation and detection, usage of lighting correction for sky color detection is investigated. As such, the impact of color constancy on sky color detection algorithms is evaluated and investigated. The color correction (constancy) algorithms used includes Gray-Edge (GE), Gray-World (GW), Max-RGB (MRGB) and Shades-of-Gray (SG). The algorithms GE, GW, MRGB, and SG, are tested on the static <b>filtered</b> <b>sky</b> modeling. The static filter is developed in the LAB color space. This evaluation and analysis is essential for detection scenarios, especially, color based object detection in outdoor scenes. From the results, it is concluded that the color constancy before sky color detection using LAB static filters {{has the potential of}} improving sky color detection performance. However, the application of the color constancy can impart adverse effects on the detection results. For images, the color constancy algorithms depict a compact and stable representative of the sky chroma loci, however, the sky color locus might have a shifting and deviation in a particular color representation. Since the <b>sky</b> static <b>filters</b> are using the static chromatic values, different results can be obtained by applying color constancy algorithms on various datasets...|$|R

Colour temperature meters can read the temperature of the existing lighting conditions and guide the selection of the <b>filter.</b> Clouded <b>sky,</b> for example, requires a paler amber than clear blue <b>sky.</b> If a <b>filter</b> is unavailable, flash is an alternative solution which usually provides enough neutral white light to counter the cast.|$|R

40|$|In {{deriving}} compass {{information from}} the pattern of polarized light in the sky (celestial e-vector pattern), hymenopteran insects like bees and ants accomplish a truly formidable task. Theoretically, one could solve the task by going back to first principles and using spherical geometry to compute the exact position of the sun from single patches of polarized skylight. The insect, however, does not resort to such computationally demanding solutions. Instead, during its evolutionary history, it has incorporated the fundamental spatial properties of the celestial pattern of polarization in the very periphery of its nervous system, the photoreceptor layer. There, in a specialized part of the retina (POL area), the analyser (microvillar) directions of the photoreceptors are arranged {{in a way that}} mimics the e-vector pattern in the <b>sky</b> {matched <b>filtering).</b> When scanning the sky, i. e. sweeping its matched array of analysers across the celestial e-vector pattern, the insect experiences peak responses of summed receptor outputs whenever it is aligned with the symmetry plane of the sky, which includes the solar meridian, the perpendicular from the sun to the horizon.

40|$|We {{describe}} an accurate new method for determining absolute magnitudes, and hence also K-corrections, which is simpler than most previous methods, being {{based on a}} quadratic function of just one suitably chosen observed color. The method relies on the extensive and accurate new set of 129 empirical galaxy template SEDs from Brown et al. (2014). A key advantage of our method {{is that we can}} reliably estimate random errors in computed absolute magnitudes due to galaxy diversity, photometric error and redshift error. We derive K-corrections for the five Sloan Digital <b>Sky</b> Survey <b>filters</b> and provide parameter tables for use by the astronomical community. Using the New York Value-Added Galaxy Catalog we compare our K-corrections with those from kcorrect. Our K-corrections produce absolute magnitudes that are generally in good agreement with kcorrect. Absolute g, r, i, z-band magnitudes differ by less than 0. 02 mag, and those in the u-band by ~ 0. 04 mag. The evolution of rest-frame colors as a function of redshift is better behaved using our method, with relatively few galaxies being assigned anomalously red colors and a tight red sequence being observed across the whole 0. 0 < z < 0. 5 redshift range.

For example, a yellow or, more dramatically, orange or red, filter will enhance the contrast between clouds and sky by darkening the blue sky. A deep green filter will also darken the sky, and additionally lighten green foliage, making it stand out against the <b>sky.</b> A blue <b>filter</b> mimics the effect of older orthochromatic film, or even older film sensitive only to blue light, rendering blue as light and red and green as dark, showing blue skies as overcast with no contrast between sky and clouds, darkening blond hair, making blue eyes nearly white and red lips nearly black.

The accuracy of quasar photometric redshifts does not appear to be dependent upon magnitude to nearly 21 st magnitude in i'. Careful calibration of the color-redshift relation to 21 st magnitude may allow for the discovery of on the order of 10 ^ 6 quasars candidates in addition to the 10 ^ 5 quasars that the SDSS will confirm spectroscopically.

However, the uncertainty assigned to the dipole by the Planck team is much larger than that found in the WMAP studies, leading the authors of the Planck study to conclude that the observed bulk flow is not statistically significant.

In general, the TOMS ozone is about 3 % higher than the Brewer ozone. The seasonal variations of total ozone and UV radiation from January 1995 to April 2001 are discussed.

Surface UV radiation also exhibits seasonal cycles that have maxima in July and minima in January. The solar zenith angle (SZA) is confirmed as a crucial factor governing both the seasonal change and magnitude of the surface UV radiation. Clouds and total ozone are also important.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{the first in a series}} devoted to the hard X-ray whole sky survey {{performed}} by the INTEGRAL observatory over seven years. Here we present an improved method for image reconstruction with the IBIS coded mask telescope. The main improvements are related to the suppression of systematic effects which strongly limit sensitivity in the region of the Galactic Plane (GP), especially in the crowded field of the Galactic Center (GC). We extended the IBIS/ISGRI background model to take into account the Galactic Ridge X-ray Emission (GRXE). To suppress residual systematic artifacts on a reconstructed sky image we applied nonparametric <b>sky</b> image <b>filtering</b> based on wavelet decomposition. The implemented modifications of the sky reconstruction method decrease the systematic noise in the ~ 20 Ms deep field of GC by ~ 44 %, and practically remove it from the high-latitude sky images. New observational data sets, along with an improved reconstruction algorithm, allow us to conduct the hard X-ray survey with the best currently available minimal sensitivity 3. 7 E- 12 erg/s/cm 2 ~ 0. 26 mCrab in the 17 - 60 keV band at a 5 sigma detection level.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{algorithms}} {{in use today}} which determine spacecraft attitude by identifying stars {{in the field of}} view of a star tracker. Some methods, which date from the early 1960 's, compare the angular separation between observed stars with a small catalog. In the last 10 years, several methods have been developed which speed up the process and reduce the amount of memory needed, a key element to onboard attitude determination. However, each of these methods require some a priori knowledge of the spacecraft attitude. Although the Sun and magnetic field generally provide the necessary coarse attitude information, there are occasions when a spacecraft could get lost when it is not prudent to wait for sunlight. Also, the possibility of efficient attitude determination using only the highly accurate CCD star tracker could lead to fully autonomous spacecraft attitude determination. The need for redundant coarse sensors could thus be eliminated at substantial cost reduction. Some groups have extended their algorithms to implement a computation intense full sky scan. Some require large data bases. Both storage and speed are concerns for autonomous onboard systems. Neural network technology is even being explored by some as a possible solution, but because of the limited number of patterns that can be stored and large overhead, nothing concrete has resulted from these efforts.

The growing field of astrophotonics (the use of photonic technologies in astronomy) could solve this problem by allowing mass production of fully integrated and robust instruments combining various optical functions, with the potential to reduce the size, complexity and cost of instruments.

In these groups we select the dominant spiral galaxy and search its surroundings for dwarf galaxies and tidal interactions. This paper presents the first results from deep wide-field imaging of NGC 7331, where we detect only four low luminosity candidate dwarf companions and a stellar stream that may be evidence of a past tidal interaction. The dwarf galaxy candidates have surface brightnesses of mu_{r} ~ 23 - 25 mag/arcsec^{ 2 } with (g-r) colors of 0. 57 - 0. 75 mag in the Sloan Digital <b>Sky</b> Survey <b>filter</b> system, consistent with their being dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph).

If it is tidal debris, then this stream could have probably formed from a rare type of interaction between NGC 7331 and a dwarf irregular or transition-type dwarf galaxy. We compare the structure and local environments of NGC 7331 to those of other nearby giant spirals in small galaxy groups. NGC 7331 has a much lower (2 %) stellar mass in the form of early-type satellites than found for M 31 and lacks the presence of nearby companions like luminous dwarf elliptical galaxies or the Magellanic Clouds.

LED lighting is more broadband so this is not blocked although white LEDs have from themselves a considerably lower output around 480 nm which is close to O III and H-beta wavelength. The broadband filters have a wider range because the narrower transmission range causes a fainter image of sky objects, and since the work of these filters is revealing the details of nebulae from light polluted skies, it has a wider transmission for more brightness. These filters are particularly designed for nebulae observing, are not useful with other deep sky objects.

Coma and tail monitoring was performed during 51 nights between 22 August 2015 and 9 May 2016. The images through r and i Sloan Digital <b>Sky</b> Survey (SDSS) <b>filters</b> show the dust distribution around the comet, while {{images in the}} SDSS g filter indicate also the presence of coma gas in early September 2015. The dust color of 67 P implies intrinsic reddening of 9 %/ 100 nm. After maximum shortly after perihelion passage the dust activity decreased with a heliocentric exponent of 4. 1 to 4. 2 from late September 2015 until May 2016. The opposition surge during early 2016 {{can be explained by}} a linear light scattering phase function (beta ~ 0. 04) or an asteroid-like HG-type phase function (G ~ 0. 15). The radial brightness profile indicates a 'quasi-steady-state' dust coma from late September to the end of 2015. Dust fragmentation during about a month after perihelion may be responsible for radial coma profiles with slopes below unity, while dust accumulation due to very slow dust expansion velocity may result in steeper than unity profiles during 2016. Three fan-shape dust structures are characterized in the coma of 67 P. A short dust ejection event on 22 - 23 August 2015 has produced a dust arc-let and jet feature in the coma. In September 2015 the appearance of cometary dust tail is dominated by young dust produced around perihelion. The older dust dominates the tail appearance as of mid November 2015.

40|$|The {{complete}} 10 -year survey {{from the}} Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will image {approx} 20, 000 square degrees of <b>sky</b> in six <b>filter</b> bands every few nights, bringing the final survey depth to r {approx} 27. 5, with over 4 billion well measured galaxies. To {{take full advantage}} of this unprecedented statistical power, the systematic errors associated with weak lensing measurements need to be controlled to a level similar to the statistical errors. This work is the first attempt to quantitatively estimate the absolute level and statistical properties of the systematic errors on weak lensing shear measurements due to the most important physical effects in the LSST system via high fidelity ray-tracing simulations. We identify and isolate the different sources of algorithm-independent, additive systematic errors on shear measurements for LSST and predict their impact on the final cosmic shear measurements using conventional weak lensing analysis techniques. We find that the main source of the errors comes from an inability to adequately characterise the atmospheric point spread function (PSF) due to its high frequency spatial variation on angular scales smaller than {approx} 10 {prime} in the single short exposures, which propagates into a spurious shear correlation function at the 10 {sup - 4 }- 10 {sup - 3 } level on these scales. With the large multi-epoch dataset that will be acquired by LSST, the stochastic errors average out, bringing the final spurious shear correlation function to a level very close to the statistical errors. Our results imply that the cosmological constraints from LSST will not be severely limited by these algorithm-independent, additive systematic effects...|$|R
40|$|This {{overview}} {{article describes the}} legacy prospect and discovery potential of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) beyond cosmological studies, illustrating it with examples from the DES early data. DES is using a wide-field camera (DECam) on the 4 m Blanco Telescope in Chile to image 5000 sq deg of the <b>sky</b> in five <b>filters</b> (grizY). By its completion the survey {{is expected to have}} generated a catalogue of 300 million galaxies with photometric redshifts and 100 million stars. In addition, a time-domain survey search over 27 sq deg is expected to yield a sample of thousands of Type Ia supernovae and other transients. The main goals of DES are to characterise dark energy and dark matter, and to test alternative models of gravity; these goals will be pursued by studying large scale structure, cluster counts, weak gravitational lensing and Type Ia supernovae. However, DES also provides a rich data set which allows us to study many other aspects of astrophysics. In this paper we focus on additional science with DES, emphasizing areas where the survey makes a difference with respect to other current surveys. The paper illustrates, using early data (from `Science Verification', and from the first, second and third seasons of observations), what DES can tell us about the solar system, the Milky Way, galaxy evolution, quasars, and other topics. In addition, we show that if the cosmological model is assumed to be Lambda + Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) then important astrophysics can be deduced from the primary DES probes. Highlights from DES early data include the discovery of 34 Trans Neptunian Objects, 17 dwarf satellites of the Milky Way, one published z > 6 quasar (and more confirmed) and two published superluminous supernovae (and more confirmed) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{measured}} the stellar mass growth of galaxies {{over the last}} 8 Gyr (z < 1. 2) by deriving B and K-band luminosity functions and inferring mass evolution from these. Accuracy was achieved using improved methods for determining both total apparent magnitudes and K-corrections. The very large sample size of 335, 000 galaxies in Bootes is ~ 10 times larger than samples in previous studies covering a similar redshift range, and this reduced cosmic variance errors to a minimum. Our accurate method of accounting for all the light coming from an individual galaxy was based on analysis of growth curves of magnitude with aperture diameter for isolated galaxies. Our measurements of galaxy luminosity used an improved method of determining K-corrections which is both simpler and more accurate than many previous methods, being based on a quadratic function of just one suitably chosen observed colour. The method relies on the extensive and accurate new set of 125 empirical galaxy template SEDs from Brown et al. (2013). Our sample was divided into red and blue subsamples using an evolving cut in restframe colour-magnitude space and we studied these separately as well as together. To quantify luminosity evolution we fitted Schechter functions to our B and K-band luminosity functions and compared the evolution of these with previous studies in the literature. Assuming published K-band stellar mass to light ratios based on optical colour, we derived stellar mass functions. We found that the stellar mass density of red galaxies increased {{by a factor of}} ~ 1. 9 from z = 1. 1 to z = 0. 3, while that of blue galaxies increased only by a factor of ~ 1. 4. These measurements are consistent with migration of blue galaxies to the red sequence as they cease to form stars. We also found that the most massive red galaxies hardly changed in mass from z = 1. 1 to z = 0. 3, whilst the most massive blue galaxies decreased in mass by a factor of ~ 0. 6. This further confirmed the phenomenon of "downsizing" reported by many authors whereby the most massive star-forming galaxies ceased star formation first and moved to the red sequence. For red galaxies we compared these results with inferences from our measurements of B-band luminosity function evolution. In addition to using the new K-correction method for our B and K-band luminosity functions, we also derived K-corrections for the five Sloan Digital <b>Sky</b> Survey <b>filters</b> and make tables of the parameters for these publicly available to the astronomical community. Using a sample of SDSS galaxies we demonstrated that our method provides superior accuracy in several respects to the commonly used kcorrect method, with clearer restframe colour separation of red and blue galaxies, a much tighter red sequence, and no spurious cloud of extremely red galaxies at z~ 0. 2 which is not present in the low redshift Universe...|$|R
