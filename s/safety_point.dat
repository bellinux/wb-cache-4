25|$|Initially the {{committee}} proposed an independent investigation {{board for the}} maritime sector, either {{as part of the}} Norwegian Maritime Authority or as an independent agency subordinate to the Ministry of Justice. During the political discussions a joint board was favored instead. Parliament approved the new jurisdiction in 2004. However, it took four years to implement the decision, and nine years from the conclusions of {{the committee}} were presented. The delays were caused by the legal implications and complexity of the investigations. Because the board was only to investigate from a <b>safety</b> <b>point</b> of view, a new legal and administrative framework had to be implemented to ensure that the Norwegian Police Service take over the responsibility for criminal investigation of the marine accidents.|$|E
25|$|In {{particular}} the investigations of MS Scandinavian Star, MS Estonia and MS Jan Heweliusz during the 1990s caused a {{questioning of the}} quality of marine accident investigations, and the other Nordic countries established marine investigation boards during that decade. Work on reforming the marine system started in 1998 and resulted in a committee recommending the system be scrapped in favor of an accident investigation board. The prime reason was that the Institute of Maritime Enquiry was regarded as having insufficient competence to investigate major accidents. There were also concerns that the system mixed the criminal prosecution and the safety investigation aspects, which could hinder a proper learning to take place from an accident. The system used court interviews with witnesses, with owners, insurance companies and press present. Facing both legal and economic consequences, witnesses would often give testimonies of reduced accuracy, hindering proper investigation from a <b>safety</b> <b>point</b> of view.|$|E

2500|$|From 1956 a {{permanent}} secretariat was appointed, the Aviation Accident Commission (...) [...] However, the various commissions members were only {{tied to the}} commission {{during the period of}} the investigation. By the 1980s this had increased to two full-time technicians and a clerk. This period saw accident commissions with a significantly different mission than later. Firstly, it only investigated actual accidents of a certain size. General aviation accidents as well as near-accidents were not investigated. Secondly, the commissions were both given the task to uncover the cause of the accident from a <b>safety</b> <b>point</b> of view, but also to uncover any criminal occurrences. This was the reason for including police and prosecution officials in the commissions.|$|E
