500|$|A {{personal}} {{priority of}} Rutherford {{had been the}} establishment of a university. Though the Edmonton Bulletin opined that it would be unfair [...] "that the people of the Province should be taxed for the <b>special</b> <b>benefit</b> of four per cent that {{they may be able to}} attach the cognomen of B.A. or M.A. to their names and flaunt the vanity of such over the taxpayer, who has to pay for it", Rutherford proceeded quickly. [...] He was concerned that delay might result in the creation of denominational colleges, striking a blow to his dream of a high quality non-sectarian system of post-secondary education. A bill establishing the University was passed by the legislature, but left the government to decide the location. Calgary felt that, having lost the fight to be provincial capital, it could expect the university to be established there, and was not pleased a year later when the government announced the founding of the University of Alberta in Rutherford's hometown of Strathcona.|$|E
2500|$|Under Proposition 218, no {{assessment}} may {{be imposed}} on any parcel which exceeds the reasonable cost of the proportional <b>special</b> <b>benefit</b> conferred on that parcel. [...] The proportionality requirement ensures that the aggregate assessment imposed on all parcels is distributed among all assessed parcels {{in proportion to the}} special benefits conferred on each parcel. [...] An agency may provide a discounted assessment less than the reasonable cost of the proportional <b>special</b> <b>benefit</b> conferred so long as any discounts do not cause the assessments imposed on the remaining parcels in the assessment district to exceed the reasonable cost of the proportional <b>special</b> <b>benefit</b> conferred on those parcels.|$|E
2500|$|Proposition 218 also {{requires}} an agency {{to separate the}} general <b>benefits</b> from the <b>special</b> <b>benefits</b> conferred on a parcel. [...] Pre-Proposition 218 case law did not invalidate assessments because they also provided general benefits in addition to <b>special</b> <b>benefits,</b> and the courts did not demand a strict separation of general <b>benefits</b> from <b>special</b> <b>benefits.</b> [...] The benefit separation requirement helps ensure compliance with the requirement that only <b>special</b> <b>benefits</b> are assessable. [...] Since general benefits are not assessable, they must be excluded and financed using revenue sources other than assessments.|$|R

2500|$|An {{agency that}} proposes to levy an {{assessment}} under Proposition 218 must first identify all parcels {{which will have}} a <b>special</b> <b>benefit</b> conferred upon them and upon which an assessment is proposed for imposition. [...] The geographic area determined by an agency to contain all parcels of property which will have a <b>special</b> <b>benefit</b> conferred upon them {{is referred to as}} an assessment district.|$|E
2500|$|Proposition 218 {{provides}} that parcels within an assessment district that are owned or used by any agency, the State of California, or the United States are not exempt from assessment unless the agency can demonstrate by {{clear and convincing}} evidence that the publicly owned parcels receive no <b>special</b> <b>benefit.</b> [...] This requirement has been confirmed and upheld by a California appellate court.|$|E
2500|$|The term “assessment” {{is defined}} as “any levy or charge upon real {{property}} by an agency for a <b>special</b> <b>benefit</b> conferred upon the real property.” [...] If a levy or charge is an “assessment,” it {{is subject to the}} procedures and requirements applicable to assessments in Article XIII D. [...] The detailed procedures and requirements for “assessments” are contained in Section 4 of Article XIII D.|$|E

[...] Proposition 218 does not preclude assessments for services, but under the constitutional language only “property-related services” are assessable. [...] A “property-related service” is “a public service having a direct relationship to property ownership.” ...|$|E
2500|$|A “special benefit” means “a {{particular}} and distinct benefit {{over and above}} general benefits conferred on real property locate in the district or {{to the public at}} large. [...] General enhancement of property value does not constitute ‘special benefit.’” [...] The California Supreme Court confirmed the tighter “special benefit” definition in interpreting it to mean that a <b>special</b> <b>benefit</b> must affect an assessed [...] property {{in a way that is}} {{particular and}} distinct from its effect on other parcels, and that real property in general and the public at large do not share.|$|E

2500|$|The California Department of General Services is {{required}} to develop compliance standards in the State Administrative Manual to inform owners of state property in California of their duties and responsibilities under Proposition 218.

[...] If the assessment is valid, then the state agency which owns or controls the property must promptly pay its proportionate share of the assessment.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to Proposition 218, {{a person}} {{challenging}} an assessment had the burden {{to prove that}} the assessment was not legal. [...] An important reform under Proposition 218 is that it shifted the burden of demonstrating compliance to the local agency in a lawsuit challenging an assessment. [...] In any legal action contesting the validity of an assessment, the burden is on the local agency to demonstrate that the properties in question receive a <b>special</b> <b>benefit</b> over and above the benefits conferred on the public at large and that the amount of any contested assessment is proportional to, and no greater than, the benefits conferred on the properties in question. [...] This change makes it significantly easier for taxpayers to win a legal challenge.|$|E
