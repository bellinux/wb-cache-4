40|$|We {{report and}} discuss the rare case of a {{pituitary}} abscess forming within a Rathke’s cleft cyst (RCC). A 66 -year-old gentleman presented with visual deterioration and <b>symptoms</b> suggestive <b>of</b> <b>hypopituitarism.</b> The patient underwent transsphenoidal debulking of the lesion whereupon purulent material was discovered. Histological examination was suggestive of RCC together with numerous neutrophils characteristic of abscess. Microbiological culture of the material grew Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was treated for a RCC abscess and received antibio-tics and endocrine replacement therapy. The patient has been followed up for 2 years without recurrence.

40|$|Results {{of recent}} and ongoing studies {{have made it}} clear that brain {{injuries}} like Traumatic Brian Injury (TBI) pose substantial risk to pituitary function, perhaps even greater risk than previously believed. Patients with TBI should be screened both prospectively and retrospectively for isolated, multiple and even total pituitary deficits. It is well known that, patients with “classical” hypopituitarism (due to primary hypothalamic-pituitary pathologies) do benefit from hormonal replacement therapy. It has been suggested that patients with TBI-induced hypopituitarism may benefit with appropriate hormonal replacement receiving replacement therapy such as anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), glucocorticoid and thyroid hormones when needed. Gonadal and recombinant human Growth Hormone (rhGH) replacement therapy should also be introduced if there are deficiencies demonstrated and even reconfirmed in a second step. The signs and <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> post-TBI <b>hypopituitarism</b> may be masked by what has been assumed to be merely the post-traumatic syndrome. By increasing awareness among physicians of the risks of brain injuries–induced endocrinopathies and the need for appropriate endocrinological testing, it may be possible to improve the quality of life and enhance the rehabilitation prospects for these patients. In most instances, these patients are first seen and treated by trauma surgeons and neurosurgeons, and subsequently by rehabilitation physicians; they must be knowledgeable about the risks <b>of</b> <b>hypopituitarism</b> so that they can determine which patients are candidates for screening for hypopituitarism. In addition, endocrinologists and internists must be educated about TBI-induced hypopituitarism and encouraged to actively share their expertise with other physicians...|$|R
40|$|Background: Lymphocytic {{hypophysitis}} and Sheehan s syndrome {{are rare}} disorders predominantely affecting {{women in the}} peripartum period.

40|$|Although the {{excessive}} secretion of GH leads to insulin resistance enhancement, {{the involvement of}} a silent somatotroph adenoma in abnormal glucose tolerance has not been elucidated. A 50 - year-old man was admitted with a headache and bitemporal hemianopia caused by a pituitary macroadenoma. He had no physical signs and <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> acromegaly nor <b>hypopituitarism,</b> and his base-line serum levels of GH and insulin - like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) were normal.

A transsphenoidal adenomectomy was performed, and we diagnosed the patient as having a silent somatotroph adenoma based on positive GH in the immunohistochemistry. Postoperative OGTT showed GH suppression and a normal pattern of plasma glucose levels after glucose loading. The post-surgery homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA - IR) and the Matsuda Index indicated improved insulin sensitivity {{in the absence of}} perioperative body-mass-index change.

We included data from 14 studies {{with a total of}} 931 patients. There was considerable variation in definition <b>of</b> <b>hypopituitarism.</b> Overall, reported prevalences of severe GH deficiency varied between 2 and 39 %. Prevalences were 8 - 20 % using the GHRH-arginine test (cutoff < 9 microg/l), 11 - 39 % using the glucagon test (cutoff 1 - 5 microg/l), 2 % using the GHRH test (no cutoff), and 15 - 18 % using the insulin tolerance test (ITT; cutoff < 3 microg/l). Overall, the reported prevalence of secondary adrenal insufficiency had a broad range from 0 to 60 %. This prevalence was 0 - 60 % with basal cortisol (cutoff < 220 or < 440 nmol/l), 7 - 19 % using the ACTH test, and 5 % with the ITT as first test (cutoff < 500 or < 550 nmol/l).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: If venous {{congestion}} {{is the primary}} cause of pituitary gland enlargement in cases of dural arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs), other abnormal pituitary findings may be detectable on MR images. We sought to investigate the perfusion abnormality of the pituitary gland secondary to dural AVFs in the cavernous sinus and to clarify its clinical importance. METHODS: Nine consecutive patients (all female; age range, 50 – 77 years) with dural AVFs in the cavernous sinus underwent prospective MR examinations, including dynamic studies, before and after therapy. Their clinical signs and symptoms were recorded. Two radiologists visually evaluated the enhancement patterns of the anterior pituitary gland. Dynamic MR curves were obtained by locating regions of interest at the center and bilateral peripheral areas of the anterior pituitary gland on coronal images. MR images obtained in five healthy individ-uals served as controls. RESULTS: No patient had <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypopituitarism</b> or other endocrine abnormalities.

Four patients had impaired cortisol responses to ITT, and gradual but diminished cortisol responses to ovine corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF- 41). There {{was no significant difference}} between mean peak increments in response to ITT and those in response to CRF- 41. TSH responses to TRH were delayed in five and absent in two patients; four of these had low free T 4 index. Prolactin was raised in all seven women and increased further in response to TRH. Two patients had impaired gonadotrophin responses to LHRH. None of the patients had clinical or biochemical evidence of diabetes insipidus.

This {{study investigated the}} characteristics of 11 patients with DI and hypopituitarism which developed after severe hypoxic encephalopathy. MethodsThe medical records of patients with DI and hypopituitarism after severe hypoxic encephalopathy from 1997 to 2002 were retrospectively reviewed. Eleven patients with DI and hypopituitarism after severe hypoxic episodes were included. Demographic data, primary diagnosis, the time of onset of DI, the time of diagnosis of hypopituitarism, the presence of <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypopituitarism,</b> and outcome of these patients were analyzed. ResultsEleven patients comprising nine females and two males aged 47. 4 ± 19. 3 years (range, 24 - 74 years) were included. The mean interval from the precipitating event to the onset of DI was 60 ± 46 hours (range, 11 - 131 hours). The mean interval from the precipitating event to the diagnosis of hypopituitarism was 423 ± 182 hours (range, 132 - 672 hours).

She underwent transsphenoidal resection only 10 months later for non medical reasons. During this period she was clinically asymptomatic on hormonal replacement therapy. A new MRI showed regression of the suprasellar extension and invasion to the left cavernous sinus. A firm and infiltrative mass was found during transsphenoidal surgery, and only partial resection was performed. Biopsy showed a low-grade lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The typical {{pattern of}} thyroid {{function}} tests (TFTs) associated with <b>hypopituitarism</b> consists <b>of</b> subnormal free T 4 (fT 4) or total T 4 and normal or marginally elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). A previous study calculated an incidence <b>of</b> <b>hypopituitarism</b> <b>of</b> 3. 2 cases/ 100, 000 /year by following up abnormal TFTs. The {{aim of this}} study was to verify the incidence <b>of</b> unsuspected <b>hypopituitarism</b> diagnosed by reflective testing on such samples in a Scottish population. METHODS: Prospective audit of TFT results over 15 months. Individuals with suitable results (fT 4 &# 60; 9 pmol/L, TSH &# 60; 10 mU/L) were identified by the laboratory information system at the Biochemistry Department, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, serving a population of 200, 000. fT 4 (repeat analysis following assay recalibration), total T 3, testosterone (males), luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin and cortisol were analysed on appropriate samples. RESULTS: Three hundred and eleven suitable results from 266 adult individuals were identified from a total of 73, 650 TFT results, leading to the diagnosis of 10 new cases (age range 28 - 90 years) <b>of</b> <b>hypopituitarism</b> (approximately 4 cases/ 100, 000 /year). Nine patients now attend endocrine clinics. Pituitary imaging was abnormal in five cases (2 large pituitary tumours, one macroadenoma, 2 empty sellae), normal in three cases and two patients were not scanned. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of cases <b>of</b> unsuspected <b>hypopituitarism</b> can be diagnosed by reflective testing on appropriate samples. fT 4 should be an integral part of frontline TFTs as TSH alone cannot assist in the identification <b>of</b> possible <b>hypopituitarism.</b> Laboratories are in an excellent position to assist in early identification <b>of</b> <b>hypopituitarism,</b> which may lead to improved outcomes in such patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: While {{hypopituitarism}} after {{traumatic brain}} injury (TBI) was previously considered rare, it is now {{thought to be a}} major cause of treatable morbidity among TBI survivors. Consequently, recommendations for assessment of pituitary function and replacement in TBI were recently introduced. Given the high incidence of TBI with more than 100 pr. 100, 000 inhabitants, TBI would be by far the most common cause <b>of</b> <b>hypopituitarism</b> if the recently reported prevalence rates hold true. The disproportion between this proposed incidence and the occasional cases <b>of</b> post-TBI <b>hypopituitarism</b> in clinical practice justifies reflection as to whether hypopituitarism has been unrecognized in TBI patients or whether diagnostic testing designed for high risk populations such as patients with obvious pituitary pathology has overestimated the true risk and thereby the disease burden <b>of</b> <b>hypopituitarism</b> in TBI. The findings on mainly isolated deficiencies in TBI patients, and particularly isolated growth hormone (GH) deficiency, raise the question of the potential impact of methodological confounding, determined by variable test-retest reproducibility, appropriateness of cut-off values, importance of BMI stratified cut-offs, assay heterogeneity, pre-test probability <b>of</b> <b>hypopituitarism</b> and lack <b>of</b> proper individual laboratory controls as reference population. In this review, current recommendations are discussed in light of recent available evidence...|$|R
40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) is {{recognized}} as a cause <b>of</b> <b>hypopituitarism</b> even after mild TBI. Although over the past decade, {{a growing body of}} research has detailed neuroendocrine changes induced by TBI, the mechanisms and risk factors responsible for this pituitary dysfunction are still unclear. Around the world, sports-especially combative sports-are very popular. However, sports are not generally considered as a cause of TBI in most epidemiological studies, and the link between sports-related head trauma and hypopituitarism has not been investigated until recently. Thus, there is a paucity of data regarding this important concern. Because of the large number of young sports participants with near-normal life expectancy, the implications of undiagnosed or untreated postconcussion pituitary dysfunction can be dramatic. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms and risk factors <b>of</b> <b>hypopituitarism</b> caused by sports injuries is thus an important issue that concerns both medical staff and sponsors of sports. The aim of this paper was to summarize the best evidence for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms and to discuss the current data and recommendations on sports-related head trauma as a cause <b>of</b> <b>hypopituitarism...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Sheehan’s {{syndrome}} (SS) {{refers to}} the occurrence of varying degree <b>of</b> <b>hypopituitarism</b> after parturition (1). It is a rare cause <b>of</b> <b>hypopituitarism</b> in developed countries owing to advances in obstetric care and its frequency is decreasing worldwide. However, it is still frequent in underdeveloped and developing countries. Sheehan’s syndrome is often diagnosed late as it evolves slowly (2, 3). Reports of psychoses in patients with Sheehan’s syndrome are rare. Herein, a case report of psychosis in a 31 year old woman who developed Sheehan’s syndrome preceded by postpartum haemorrhage is presented. Treatment with thyroxine and glucocorticoids resulted in complete remission after attaining euthyroid and eucortisolemic state. ...|$|R
