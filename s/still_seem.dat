5|$|On Lanzarote a {{somewhat}} {{larger number of}} these birds <b>still</b> <b>seem</b> to exist, but altogether this particular subspecies is precariously rare: Probably less than three hundred and perhaps fewer than two hundred individuals still remain. Similarly, the birds on the western Canary Islands which are usually assigned to the nominate subspecies have declined much, and here wanton destruction seems still to be significant. On Tenerife they seem relatively numerous {{but on the other}} islands, the situation looks about as bleak as on Fuerteventura. Due to their assignment to the nominate subspecies, which is common in mainland Spain, the western Canary Islands population is not classified as threatened.|$|E
25|$|The Dinky Toys ranges {{became more}} {{sophisticated}} throughout the 1950s. Some {{cars in the}} sporty pre-war line were carried on after the war like the Alvis sports tourer, the Sunbeam Talbot, or the Frazer-Nash BMW. These offerings then led to a magnificent line-up in the post war Dinky range, which included a Lagonda, an Armstrong-Siddeley, MG, Sunbeam Alpine, Austin Atlantic, Austin Healey 100, Aston Martin DB3S racer, Morris Oxford sedan and Triumph TR2 (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, pp.50–51). Additionally, several models introduced were American cars, and even now <b>still</b> <b>seem</b> unique choices, such as a 1954 Packard convertible, a 1955 Plymouth Belvedere, a Cunningham, the 1953 and 1957 Studebakers (and a 1957 Packard), a Chrysler New Yorker Convertible, a 1957 Rambler, and a late model Hudson Hornet. In many cases, even domestic British / European vehicle choices for models were not everyday selections, e. g. the Connaught racing car, Maserati Sports 2000, AC Aceca, Humber Hawk, 1954 Bristol LeMans car with large fins - and a Daimler instead of the more routine Jaguar.|$|E

She was released the next day, and it was later learned that she suffered a mini-stroke. Regarding her retirement, Sheindlin has stated that it's up to her viewers and when they tire of watching the program, which she believes will inevitably happen one day. As of the present, however, Sheindlin has stated that fans <b>still</b> <b>seem</b> to be interested and taking something out of the court show.

500|$|Conversely, Alonso Duralde of TheWrap {{said the}} film [...] "serves up jokes that don't land and thrills that don't thrill." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times said Ant-Man [...] "is a lightweight, cliché-riddled origins story that veers between inside-joke comedy, {{ponderous}} redemption story lines and admittedly nifty CGI sequences that <b>still</b> <b>seem</b> relatively insignificant {{compared to the}} high stakes and city-shattering destruction {{that take place in}} most of the Avengers movies." [...] Catherine Shoard of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Ant-Man is a cut-and-shut muddle, haunted by [...] ghost, produced by a high-end hot dog factory, by turns giddying and stupefying." [...] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal said that it is [...] "a film that will surely be popular, given Marvel's marketing might, but one that's woefully short on coherence and originality." [...] Christopher Orr of The Atlantic said, [...] "It's difficult to shake the sense that the film was assembled hurriedly and somewhat haphazardly. Which, from all available evidence, is exactly what happened." ...|$|E
500|$|Laura Herbert of BBC News {{said that}} many of the album's songs, {{including}} [...] "Radar" [...] and [...] "Toy Soldier" [...] "are repetitive and over-produced." [...] Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel said that [...] "Musically, songs such as 'Piece of Me,' 'Radar' and 'Break the Ice' are one-dimensional, robotic exercises." [...] Chris Wasser from the Irish Independent said the album had single potential, exemplifying that [...] "There's little doubting we'll hear the bouncing and digitally affected vocals of Radar and the livelier Hot As Ice on the radio soon enough, but both tracks <b>still</b> <b>seem</b> a little under par." [...] After the release of [...] "Radar" [...] single from Circus, Nick Levine of Digital Spy said it [...] "still sounds pretty ace, one of the best examples of the robopop sound Blackout essentially invented, but its fresh-out-the-box sheen has long since faded". On July 29, 2009, [...] "Radar" [...] was chosen as single of the week by FHM.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, supervising {{animator}} on {{the film}} Scott Clark, spoke about the challenges of animating car characters, saying: [...] "Getting {{a full range of}} performance and emotion from these characters and making them <b>still</b> <b>seem</b> like cars was a tough assignment, but that's what animation does best. You use your imagination, and you make the movements and gestures fit with the design. Our car characters may not have arms and legs, but we can lean the tires in or out to suggest hands opening up or closing in. We can use steering to point a certain direction. We also designed a special eyelid and an eyebrow for the windshield that lets us communicate an expressiveness that cars don't have." [...] Doug Sweetland, who also served as supervising animator, also spoke about the challenges, saying: [...] "It took a different kind of animator to really be able to interpret the Cars models, than it did to interpret something like The Incredibles models. With The Incredibles, the animator could get reference for the characters by shooting himself and watching the footage. But with Cars, it departs completely from any reference. Yes they're cars, but no car can do what our characters do. It's pure fantasy. It took a lot of trial and error to get them to look right." ...|$|E

500|$|When Vaughan first pitched [...] "Pride & Joy" [...] to Marvel, they {{immediately}} accepted it and set Runaways in the Marvel Universe, the main string of story lines that ties Marvel's canonical series. However, unlike most series (which are often set in New York City), Runaways {{is set in}} Los Angeles, an unexplored area of the Marvel Universe. This, in turn, marked a significance for the story arc at the time; being a new series, [...] "Pride & Joy" [...] had been expected {{to take place in}} New York City. Matt Fraction, a prominent writer for various Marvel Comics series quotes, [...] "It was sort of great to see in Runaways that California was such a blank slate. It was refreshing to watch Brian create this sort of whole cloth." [...] Vaughan's decision prompted Fraction to create a new series to take place in Los Angeles as well. Several notable landmarks in this story arc include Malibu, the Griffith Observatory, the James Dean memorial and Bronson Canyon in Griffith Park. In an interview with Comic Book Resources, Brian K. Vaughan quoted, [...] "I imagine that Angelinos in the Marvel Universe think of super heroes and villains the way that New Yorkers think of Hollywood celebrities. We see them on TV every day, so we know that they exist, but they <b>still</b> <b>seem</b> distant and unreal." ...|$|E

[...] He then stated [...] "Who could have imagined this tiny, unsophisticated star of Neighbours, with the bad '80s perm and questionable vocal ability, would go on to become Australia's single most successful entertainer and a world-renowned style idol?" [...] Throughout her career, Minogue has been known for reinventing herself in fashion and musical content. Fabulous Magazine labelled her a [...] "Master of Reinvention." [...] In November 2006, Minogue posed for Vogue Australia, with Larissa Dubecki from The Age labelling her the [...] "Mother of Reinvention" [...] by saying [...] "This unveiling is as cleverly managed as every aspect of her career, and her illness, to date. Like sharks, celebrities cannot remain static; they must keep moving or die. Kylie has beaten her early detractors by inhabiting almost a dozen identities" [...] Fiona MacDonald from Madison said Kylie was [...] "an icon, one of the handful of singers recognised around the world by her first name alone. And yet despite becoming an international music superstar, style icon and honorary Brit, those two syllables <b>still</b> <b>seem</b> as Australian as the smell of eucalyptus or a barbeque on a hot day." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 9, 1863, Colonel Benjamin J.

A few days later, DeLand reacted quickly to prevent escapes when a fire destroyed [...] of barracks, fences and the sutler's shop on November 11, 1863. This worked in his favor. Colonel Hoffman ordered that Colonel DeLand remain as commander. Hoffman ordered DeLand to cut rations at this time, which increased the hardships of the prisoners, although they <b>still</b> <b>seem</b> {{to have had a}} sufficient quantity of food daily.|$|E

2500|$|John's [...] "joy {{became more}} {{for him the}} more he was diminished. … This was John, {{and this is how}} the single {{individual}} is to fulfill something similar in lesser situations. If he has first of all learned to deny himself humbly and to master his mind, then joy will also be victorious. But the first must be learned first-later, that which is greater; one is first initiated into the lesser mystery, later into the mystery." [...] Kiedrkegaard says, what about the single individual who wants to be like John? Do we all know how to deny ourseves with humility? He says, Who does not know that things like these have happened and do happen in the world-that someone who once ruled over countries and kingdoms has ceased to rule and is obliged to see a more powerful ruler take his place; that someone who once was hailed with jubilation soon, yes, so soon that the whole things {{seems to have been a}} dream, hears the same jubilation shouting another name, that someone whose commanding figure was familiar to everyone regards himself in the next moment with the anxiety of uncertainty about whether he has lost his mind or the world its memory so that it confused with him someone else; that the master whole pupil only yesterday sat at his feet must bow his shoulders today under the other's advancement; that the businessman who was kind enough to set his servant on his path now sees that his path means the benefactor's downfall; that the girl who once filled her beloved's thoughts now sits and sees his bold ambition pursuing a higher goal; that the singer whose words were on everyone's lips is forgotten today and his songs have been more than replaced; that the orator whose words echoed everywhere must now seek the solitude of the desert if he wants echo; that the friend from youth who was on an equal basis with his fellows now with amazement perceives the distance; that the lowly cottage where the parents lived, where the humble cradle stood, is now collapsing like a recollection that cannot catch up with the mighty. And yet, how strange-if you let your thoughts dwell on those distinguished people whose memory the generations have preserved, you will find that the way each individual distinguished himself is different, and you will find in turn that several are distinguished by the same thing. But in that select group you <b>still</b> <b>seem</b> to lack one place, and yet the lack is indeed a contradiction; how would the one whose task it was to be reconciled-to being forgotten-find a place in recollection? But for this very reason it is important to consider it by itself, and it is especially beautiful to do this-because no earthly reward is beckoning.
