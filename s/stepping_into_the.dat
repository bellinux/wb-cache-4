5|$|The album's release {{coincided with}} Jarre's first foreign tour. In 1981 the British Embassy gave Radio Beijing copies of Oxygène and Équinoxe, {{which became the}} first pieces of foreign music to be played on Chinese {{national}} radio in decades. The republic invited Jarre {{to become the first}} western musician to play there, with Les Concerts en Chine. The performances were scheduled to run from 18 October to 5 November 1981. The first, in Beijing, was initially attended mostly by officials, but before the concert began technicians realised that not enough power was available to supply the stage and auditorium. Chinese officials solved the problem by temporarily cutting power to the surrounding districts. The stadium was almost full when the concert began, but as Beijing's buses stopped running at about 10 o'clock, about half the audience left before it finished. To boost the audience attendance for the second night, Jarre and his production team purchased some of the concert tickets and gave them to children on the streets (Jarre originally wanted the concerts to be free, but the Chinese authorities decided to charge between £0.20 and £0.50 per ticket). The event was notable for its lack of audience involvement; the Chinese were apparently unmoved by both the music and the light show, and applause was muted. The second venue, in Shanghai, was a different matter. Jarre actively encouraged audience participation by <b>stepping</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> crowd, which became much more exuberant than that in Beijing. Recordings of the concerts, which featured one of Jarre's signature electronic instruments, the laser harp, were released as a double-disc LP in 1982.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} steel cage match could be won only by {{climbing}} {{over the top}} of the cage all the way to the floor to win the match. Pinfalls and submission did not count, neither opponent could be disqualified, and the door to the cage would be locked for the entire match. As the cage lowered, Mike Tenay introduced the match and then handed the microphone over to AAA announcer Arturo Rivera to give the introductions in Spanish. Konnan came to the ring with both the IWC World Heavyweight Championship and the UWA Double Power Cup Championship that he had won from Perro Aguayo, although neither was on the line in the match. Once the door was locked, the two wrestlers began to brawl, with Aguayo trying to use Konnan as a ladder to climb out of the cage on more than one occasion. After a few minutes of fighting, Konnan dropped Aguayo face-first on the wire mesh cage, causing Aguayo to bleed (either by sheer impact or Aguayo secretly cutting himself to sell the brutality of the match). Once Aguayo started to bleed, Konnan began to focus on attacking Aguayo's forehead, including rubbing Aguayo's face across the cage. Moments later, both wrestlers found themselves on the top rope, fighting each other as they held on to the cage until Aguayo knocked Konnan off the top rope. Moments later, Aguayo attempted a pinfall even though the rules stated a pinfall did not matter. As the match progressed, sweat began to mix with his blood, causing his face to turn red. As Aguayo tried to climb out of the ring, Konnan leapt up with a low blow to keep his opponent in the cage. At that point, the cameras showed Eddie Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend watching the show from backstage, then moments later leaving the backstage area. As Aguayo climbed the cage, Los Gringos came to ringside and threw a cup of liquid in Aguayo's face. He then passed a set of brass knuckles to Konnan to use in the match. While at ringside, Guerrero got into a fistfight with several fans who were upset over his actions, forcing the security guards to step in and stop the fight. Following the assist by Los Gringos Locos, Konnan continued to attack Aguayo, with Aguayo ending up with his face and chest covered in blood from his head wound. At one point, Guerrero attacked the ringside referee, Pepe Casas, preventing him from <b>stepping</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cage to check on Aguayo. When Konnan tried to escape, Los Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000, and Universo 2000) ran to ringside, attacking Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend at ringside. As Konnan straddled the cage, Cien Caras climbed up and knocked Konnan off the top and back inside the cage, allowing Aguayo to attack his opponent. Moments later, Aguayo dove off the top rope with a double stomp on Konnan and then climbed out of the cage to victory.|$|E

25|$|Bachué: {{the mother}} of the Muisca people. It was said that a {{beautiful}} woman with a baby came out of Lake Iguaque. Bachué sat down at the bank of the lake and waited for her son to grow up. When he was old enough, they married and had many children, who were the Muisca. Bachué taught them to hunt, to farm, to respect the laws, and to worship the gods. Bachué was so good and loved that the Muisca referred to her as Furachoque (Good woman in Chibcha). When they became old, Bachué and her son and husband {{decided to go back to}} the deep of the lagoon. That day the Muisca were so sad, but at the same time very happy because they knew their mother was very happy. Other versions of the legend say that after <b>stepping</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lagoon of Iguaque, Bachué ascended to the sky and became Chía; in other versions Chia and Bachué are two different figures.|$|E

25|$|Hoping {{to avoid}} a repeat of their {{disastrous}} top flight campaign in 2000, Park started 2006 well with two wins in three but they soon capitulated when they suffered nine defeats in ten games {{to fall into the}} relegation zone. One of those losses came in an extraordinary game at Hyde which saw Park chalk up a mammoth 321-4. Shahid Mahmood was to score the quickest century in Cheshire County League history as he brought up his ton off just 29 balls. However all that hard work was extinguished as Hyde chased the total down to win by two wickets in the final over. Once again, Park could only last one season in the highest tier as they were relegated {{on the final day of}} the season. Foran stepped down as captain with Andrew Gibson <b>stepping</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> breach though the club suffered the blow of losing key players like Mahmood and Chris Stenhouse.|$|E
25|$|Unlike these earlier shows, Moonlighting {{sometimes}} {{broke the}} fourth wall {{in much more}} involved and complex ways. Cold opens sometimes featured Shepherd and Willis (in character as Maddie Hayes and David Addison), other actors, viewers, or TV critics directly addressing the audience about the show's production itself. These cold opens were originally born out of desperation {{as a way to}} fill air time, since the dialogue on the show was spoken so quickly and the producers needed something to fill the entire hour. In some other episodes, the plot suddenly changed into extended sequences that involved crew dismantling or changing the sets, characters wandering off the set into other parts of the studio, production crew <b>stepping</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> scene as a deus ex machina (e.g. a propmaster suddenly walking into the scene and taking the villain's gun away), or guest actors dropping character and referring to each other by their real names. However, other than in stand-alone openings, the main actors never stepped out of character during the episodes.|$|E
25|$|In the club's {{first season}} of league football, Wigan Athletic {{finished}} in sixth place, just six points off promotion and playing {{in front of}} an average crowd of 6,701. Two more top-half finishes came in the following seasons, though a relatively weak 1980–81 season saw the dismissal of long-serving manager Ian McNeill shortly {{before the end of the}} season. They gained their first Football League promotion under the management of former Liverpool player Larry Lloyd in 1981–82, when a points tally of 91 saw them join the former Division Three for the first time, beginning a 10-year spell in English football's third tier. The club struggled in their first season in Division Three, which led to Lloyd's sacking in early 1983, at which point Bobby Charlton, a director at the time, took over as temporary manager before being replaced by Harry McNally. Under McNally's management, the club stabilised in Division Three and secured a pair of mid-table finishes, but a dreadful 1984–85 season cost him his job, with Tranmere manager Bryan Hamilton <b>stepping</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> breach. Under Hamilton's management, the club's performances went to the next level and they won their first silverware as a league club that season with the Freight Rover Trophy. They were beaten in the Northern final of the same competition the following season by Bolton Wanderers. More importantly, Hamilton achieved Division Three survival, which had looked an impossible task earlier that season.|$|E

500|$|Indeed, {{there is}} a strong Darwinian {{undercurrent}} framing the representation of race in She, stemming from Haggard's own interest in evolutionary theory and archaeological history. In particular the theme of racial degeneration is a prominent aspect in the novel. Moving into the fin de siècle, late-Victorians were increasingly concerned about cultural and national decline resulting from racial decay. In She, this evolutionary concept of degeneration is manifested in Ayesha and the Amahagger. Haggard represents the Amahagger as a debased mixture of ethnicities, [...] "a curious mingling of races", originally descended from the inhabitants of Kôr but having intermarried with Arabs and Africans. Racial hybridisation of any kind [...] "entailed degeneration" [...] to Victorians, a [...] "decline from the pure blood" [...] of the initial races, and thus [...] "an aspect of their degeneration is the idea that the Amahagger have lost whatever elements of civilization their Kôr ancestors may have imparted to them". Thus, Ayesha proudly proclaims her own racial purity as a quality to be admired: [...] "for Arabian am I by birth, even 'al Arab al Ariba' (an Arab of the Arabs), and of the race of our father Yárab, the son of Khâtan of the true Arab blood". However, the novel's starkest evocation of the evolutionary principle occurs in the regressive demise of Ayesha. <b>Stepping</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Pillar of Fire, the immortal She begins to wither and decay, undergoing as death what Judith Wilt describes as the [...] "ultimate Darwinian nightmare", evolution in reverse.|$|E

500|$|At Rice, Humber was {{coached by}} Wayne Graham. Humber's first home {{appearance}} at Reckling Park {{was in the}} annual Rice Alumni game in February 2002. After retiring his first two batters in relief, Humber faced a pair of Major League Baseball players. José Cruz, Jr. bounced the baseball off of the wall in center field and then Lance Berkman hit the ball over the scoreboard. After his inauspicious debut, he became a dominant pitcher during his three college seasons for the Rice Owls, <b>stepping</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> nationally ranked Owls' starting rotation as a freshman. Humber finished his freshman season in 2002 with an 11–1 win–loss record, a 2.78 ERA, and a WAC-leading 130 strikeouts in [...] innings, earning National Freshman Player of the Year honors from Collegiate Baseball and All-America honors from several publications—Collegiate Baseball (Second Team), Baseball America (Second Team) and Baseball Weekly (Third Team). [...] Humber's strikeout total was the most for an Owl freshman since 1976. That season, Rice reached the 2002 College World Series, but lost its first two games and was eliminated. Nonetheless, Humber earned an invitation to USA Baseball's national team trials. He was the scheduled starter in {{the second of the}} two games, which was against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish on June 17, but the team could not hold a 3–2 lead {{in the bottom of the}} ninth. He then competed for the United States national baseball team at the 2002 World University Baseball Championship, which was held in Messina, Sicily. On August 7, he earned a victory for the United States in a game against the South Korean team. The United States won the silver medal in the tournament.|$|E

[...] Permitted by Lim to search his flat, the police found traces of blood. [...] Lim initially tried to pass the stains off as candle wax, but when challenged claimed they were chicken blood. [...] After the police [...] found slips of paper written with the dead children's personal details, Lim tried to allay suspicions by claiming that Ghazali had come to his flat seeking treatment for a bleeding nose. [...] He discreetly removed hair from under a carpet and tried to flush it down the toilet, but the police stopped him; forensics later determined the hair to be Ng's. [...] Requesting a background check on Lim, Pereira received word from local officers that the medium was currently involved in a rape investigation. [...] Lim overheard them and became agitated, raising his voice at the law enforcers. [...] His ire was mimicked by Hoe as she gestured violently and shouted at the officers. [...] Their actions further raised the investigators' suspicions that the trio were deeply involved in the murders.

[...] "Ice Hockey Hair" [...] begins playing approximately 17 seconds into the video. Each character is again seen in a white rectangle in the centre of the screen followed by a shot of a pair of hands holding a strip of photos of that particular person during which red text is displayed showing the character's name. A woman with short blonde hair and a red top, seen holding {{her head in her hands}} is introduced as [...] "The wife"; a bald man with blood on his head is [...] "The husband"; a woman in a white jacket with a blonde mullet hairstyle is [...] "The mistress"; a man with thick-rimmed glasses, a white jacket, and red polo neck sweater is [...] "The voyeur"; and a man in a red and black tracksuit top with a large scar running from his left eye to right cheek is [...] "The stalker". The five characters are all seen singing along to the track individually, again framed in a white rectangle in the centre of the screen. [...] "The wife" [...] is twice shown ripping a photograph of her and [...] "The husband", while [...] "The mistress" [...] is seen sitting on the lap of [...] "The husband" [...] in two shots. After 1 minute and 6 seconds the Super Furry Animals are shown playing along to the track on a rotating dancefloor surrounded by photo booths and several dancers in dark clothes. During an instrumental break in the song, at 1 minute 38 seconds, two masked men are shown playing table tennis on another rotating dancefloor with two large fluorescent purple circles in the background. The five characters are then seen walking around the band and <b>stepping</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> photo booths that surround them. The text [...] "Act 1: The kiss" [...] is shown, after which footage of the Super Furry Animals playing along to the track is intercut with shots of the characters.
