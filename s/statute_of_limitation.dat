50|$|In many cases, both a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> and a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> repose {{will apply}} to the same case, and a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> may cut off {{liability}} even if the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> has not run. For example, a defect in an airplane might cause a crash twelve years after the date of initial sale, with the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> for a personal injury claim commencing on {{the date of the}} crash, but where a ten year <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> repose on product liability claims will have already expired. The earlier expiration <b>of</b> the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> repose will prevent the personal injury claim even before the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> starts to run.|$|R

25|$|For example, in Pennsylvania, {{there is}} a two-year <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitation,</b> but in other states the {{limitations}} period may be longer.

25|$|Lane {{points out}} that Berlusconi has not defended himself in court against the main charges, but has relied upon {{political}} and legal manipulations, most notably by changing the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> to prevent charges being completed in the first place. In order to publicly prove {{the truth of the}} documented accusations contained in their articles, the newspaper has publicly challenged Berlusconi to sue The Economist for libel. Berlusconi did so, losing versus The Economist, and being charged for all the trial costs on 5 September 2008, when the Court in Milan issued a judgment rejecting all Mr Berlusconi's claims and sentenced him to compensate for The Economists legal expenses.|$|E

While most U.S. states have a four-year <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> (and the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Elizabeth in some common law jurisdictions has no <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations),</b> the general <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> in the Cook Islands is reduced to two years for fraudulent transfers; in certain circumstances, it may be as short as one year.

50|$|The Supreme Court {{affirmed the}} decision, holding that {{the action was}} barred by the Oklahoma <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> because the scope of Rule 3 was not {{sufficiently}} broad to control the issue before the District Court. There was no indication that the Rule was intended to toll a state <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations,</b> much less that it purported to displace state tolling rules for purposes <b>of</b> state <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations.</b> In diversity actions, Rule 3 governs the date from which various timing requirements of the Federal Rules begin to run, but does not affect state <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations.</b>|$|R
25|$|In February 2006 {{the trial}} opened against five journalists charged with {{insulting}} the judicial {{institutions of the}} State under Article 301, and also of aiming to prejudice a court case under Article 288 of the Turkish Penal Code. Each of the five had criticized {{a court order to}} shut down a conference in Istanbul about the Ottoman Armenian casualties in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War. (The conference was nevertheless eventually held after having been transferred from a state university to a private university.) The charges carried a potential penalty of a prison term of up to 10 years. The court dropped the charges against four of them on April 11, 2006 when it was determined that the time allowed by the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> had been exceeded, while Murat Belge, the fifth, was acquitted on June 8, 2006.|$|E
500|$|In August 1992, Congress enacted {{legislation}} by voice vote to toll the Catawba's <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> for one year, {{in order}} to increase the time to negotiate a settlement. [...] A settlement was negotiated wherein the Catawba's aboriginal title would be extinguished in exchange for $50,000,000. [...] Legislation approving the settlement (as is required for any settlement extinguishing aboriginal title) was passed in August 1993, soon [...] after Congress passed President Bill Clinton's omnibus budget legislation. [...] In addition, the settlement act repealed the Catawba termination act. [...] The tribe voted to approve the settlement.|$|E
500|$|Following the court's decision, {{an appeal}} was lodged {{by the state}} {{prosecutor}} against Patrick Head and Adrian Newey. On 22 November 1999, the appeal absolved Head and Newey of all charges, stating that no new evidence had come to light (there was missing data from the black box recorder on Senna's car due to damage, and 1.6 seconds of video from the onboard camera of Senna's car was unavailable because the broadcaster switched to another car's camera just before the accident), and so under Article 530 of the Italian Penal Code, the accusation had to be declared as [...] "non-existent or the fact doesn't subsist". This appeal result was annulled in January 2003, as the Court of Cassation believed that Article 530 was misinterpreted, and a retrial was ordered. On 27 May 2005, Newey was acquitted of all charges while Head's case was [...] "timed out" [...] under a statute of limitations. The Italian Court of Appeal, on 13 April 2007, stated the following in the verdict numbered 15050: [...] "It has been determined that the accident {{was caused by a}} steering column failure. This failure was caused by badly designed and badly executed modifications. The responsibility of this falls on Patrick Head, culpable of omitted control". Even being found responsible for Senna's accident, Patrick Head was not arrested, as the verdict was delivered past the Italian <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> for manslaughter.|$|E
2500|$|In United States v.

5000|$|In Classical Athens, {{a five-year}} <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> was {{established}} for all cases except homicide {{and the prosecution}} of non-constitutional laws (which had no limitation).

2500|$|Following {{the denial}} of a new trial, Bennison then pursued his appeal to the Court of Review for the Trial of a Bishop, which heard his case in Wilmington, Delaware on May 4, 2010. The basis for the appeal was a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> {{provision}} {{that had been in}} effect before a Presentment charge had ever been filed against Bishop Bennison. [...] While Bishop Bennison's attorney had repeatedly raised the matter of the limitation statute, the earlier trial court had declined to rule on the issue for unexplained reasons.|$|E
2500|$|However, the South Korean {{government}} {{used most}} of the loans for economic development and have failed to provide adequate compensation to victims, paying only 300,000 won per death, with only a total of 2,570 million won to the relatives of 8,552 victims who died in forced labor. As the result, the Korean victims were preparing to file a compensation suit against the South Korean government as of 2005. The treaty does not preclude individual suits against Japanese individuals or corporations but such suits are often constrained by the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitation.</b> Women's International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan's Military Sexual Slavery, a mock trial organised by and supported by Japanese NGO Women's International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan's Military Sexual Slavery, issued a ruling that [...] "states cannot agree by treaty to waive the liability of another state for crimes against humanity." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 18 January 2000, {{the judges}} {{dismissed}} the charges {{because of the}} <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> on the case filed for the jewelry store robbery and for [...] "breach of the Firearms Act" [...] (law no. 6136). For embezzlement and money theft Ağca was sentenced to 36 years of imprisonment. Ağca's lawyers applied for their client's release under Law no. 4516 on Parole and Deferral of Penalties in December 2000. Their request was denied by the 1st High Criminal Court of Kartal. The lawyers filed an appeal against this decision, but the appeals court upheld the ruling. Ağca's life sentence was reduced to 10 {{years in prison for}} murder under a Turkish law that shortened prison sentences if served in a foreign prison. The money-laundering conviction and 36-year sentence were overturned because of the statute of limitations for robbery, which was 7 years under Turkish law.|$|E
50|$|The general {{time limit}} for injury {{litigation}} is three years, with multiple exceptions and special cases.

5000|$|Seale's {{conviction}} {{was overturned}} on September 9, 2008 by the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals. The {{court ruled that}} the lower court had failed to recognize the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> for kidnapping had expired. At the time of the kidnapping, the act was a capital crime under federal law; capital crimes have no <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations.</b> However, in the 1970s Congress and the Supreme Court redefined kidnapping as a non-capital crime, with a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations.</b> The lower court did not apply the newer <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations,</b> while the appeals court did. [...] The prosecutors asked the appeals court to reconsider the ruling, and the court agreed to do so en banc.|$|R

2500|$|Italian law {{requires}} that accidents resulting in a fatality must be investigated for any criminal culpability, with the associated scene of the accident secured and the activities {{that led to the}} fatality, suspended forthwith. Senna's death was thus the subject of criminal proceedings in Italy, which saw key Williams team members investigated and charged with manslaughter. The original trial in 1997 concluded with acquittals {{on the grounds that the}} prosecution had failed to prove its case. This prosecution culminated with verdict no. 15050 handed down by the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation on 13 April 2007, which stated: [...] "It has been determined that the accident was caused by a [...] steering column failure. This failure was caused by badly designed and badly executed modifications. The responsibility of this falls on Patrick Head, culpable of omitted control". Head, however, was never arrested because the Italian <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> for manslaughter is 7 years and 6 months, and the final verdict was pronounced 13 years after the accident.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to 2001, {{the primary}} {{responsibility}} for investigating allegations of sexual abuse and disciplining perpetrators rested with the individual dioceses. In 2001, Ratzinger convinced John Paul II to put the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith {{in charge of all}} investigations and policies surrounding sexual abuse in order to combat such abuse more efficiently. According to John L. Allen, Jr., Ratzinger in the following years [...] "acquired a familiarity with the contours of the problem that virtually no other figure in the Catholic Church can claim" [...] and [...] "driven by that encounter with what he would later refer to as 'filth' in the Church, Ratzinger seems to have undergone something of a 'conversion experience' throughout 2003–04. From that point forward, he and his staff seemed driven by a convert's zeal to clean up the mess". In his role as Head of the CDF, he [...] "led important changes made in Church law: the inclusion in canon law of internet offences against children, the extension of child abuse offences to include the sexual abuse of all under 18, the case by case waiving of the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> and the establishment of a fast-track dismissal from the clerical state for offenders." [...] As the Head of the CDF, Ratzinger developed a reputation for handling these cases. According to Charles J. Scicluna, a former prosecutor handling sexual abuse cases, [...] "Cardinal Ratzinger displayed great wisdom and firmness in handling those cases, also demonstrating great courage in facing some of the most difficult and thorny cases, sine acceptione personarum (without exceptions)".|$|E

If, as this young man says, the will provides that the proceeds of the property are to be divided into shares, who {{has the power to}} alter these provisions?" [...] The bishop had an indistinct idea that they altered themselves by the lapse of years; that a kind of ecclesiastical <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> barred the rights of the twelve bedesmen to any increase of income arising from the increased value of property. He said something about tradition; more of the many learned men who by their practice had confirmed the present arrangement; then went at some length into the propriety of maintaining the due difference in rank and income between a beneficed clergyman and certain poor old men who were dependent on charity; and concluded his argument by another reference to the archdeacon.|$|E
500|$|Without special federal {{protection}} for the Tribe, the state <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> should apply to its claim in this case. [...] For it is well established that federal claims are subject to state <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> {{unless there is a}} federal <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> or a conflict with federal policy. [...] Although federal policy may preclude the ordinary applicability <b>of</b> a state <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> for this type of action {{in the absence of a}} specific congressional enactment to the contrary, the Catawba Act clearly suffices to reestablish the usual principle regarding the applicability <b>of</b> the state <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations.</b> In striking contrast to the situation in , the Catawba Act represents an explicit redefinition of the relationship between the Federal Government and the Catawbas; an intentional termination of the special federal {{protection for}} the Tribe and its members; and a plain statement that state law applies to the Catawbas as to all “other persons or citizens.” ...|$|R

50|$|TRW {{argued that}} Andrews’ claims {{based on the}} two {{earliest}} disclosures were barred because the Fair Credit Reporting Act’s two year <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> had expired. Andrews countered that all of her claims were timely because the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> did not toll until the date she learned of the inaccurate disclosures. This argument was based upon Andrews’ contention that the FCRA incorporated a general federal rule which tolls the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> {{at the time the}} plaintiff becomes aware of the injury.|$|R
