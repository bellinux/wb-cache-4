40|$|Experimental {{studies are}} carried out {{with a view to}} compare some of the {{simulation}} results predicted using finite element analysis, with that obtained from the experiment. Experiments are performed for male-female <b>socket</b> <b>spanner</b> or adopter using round aluminium billet and flat die in ambient temperature. Metal flow pattern and filling of die cavity are studied successfully from the experiment. FEM based commercial package DEFORMÂ®- 3 D code is used for finite element analysis of the processes. Finite element analysis {{are carried out}} for the following characteristics; load versus punch displacement, effective stress, effective strain, total velocity and metal flow pattern. The results obtained from experimental investigation are found to be in good agreement with simulation results predicted by finite element analysis...|$|E
