25|$|Carmen Carlson (Allyn Ann McLerie) is Mr. Carlson's sweet-natured wife. Though happily married, {{they are}} <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> to avoid hurting each other's {{feelings}} that they rarely {{tell each other}} what they really think.

During the second season Carmen has a surprise pregnancy and during the third season gives birth to a daughter, Melanie.|$|E
25|$|The third {{test was}} far more equal, with Australia being victorious due to a 251 run {{partnership}} between Serjeant and Wood in their second innings. It was a close run result with Australia having to score 69 runs {{on the final day}} with 4 wickets in hand – Simpson later said he was <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> he could not watch the game. However Australia got home by three wickets.|$|E

25|$|According to Winkler's {{commentary}} on the DVD release of the film, he had considered numerous actresses {{for the role of}} Linda when Ashley Judd's agent advised him she was interested in the part. Winkler was certain her salary demand would exceed that allowed by the budget, but the actress was <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> to portray Linda she was willing to lower her usual asking price. Judd is twenty years younger than Kline, although the composer's wife was eight years older than he.|$|E
25|$|In {{his three}} years in Gotha, he was twice offered positions, in Stuttgart and at Oxford University; he {{declined}} both. Meanwhile, in Nuremberg, when the St. Sebaldus Church organist Georg Caspar Wecker (and his possible former teacher) died on 20 April 1695, the city authorities were <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> to appoint Pachelbel (then a famous Nuremberger) to the position that they officially invited him to assume it without holding the usual job examination or inviting applications from prominent organists from lesser churches. He accepted, was released from Gotha in 1695, and arrived in Nuremberg in summer, with the city council paying his per diem expenses.|$|E
25|$|In 1252, Alfonso X had resurrected another ancestral claim, {{this time}} to the duchy of Gascony, {{in the south of}} Aquitaine, last {{possession}} of the Kings of England in France, which he claimed had formed part of the dowry of Eleanor of England. Henry III of England swiftly countered Alfonso's claims with both diplomatic and military moves. Early in 1254 the two kings began to negotiate; after haggling over the financial provision for Eleanor, Henry and Alfonso agreed she would marry Henry's son Edward, and Alfonso would transfer his Gascon claims to Edward. Henry was <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> for the marriage to take place that he willingly abandoned elaborate preparations already made for Edward's knighting in England, and agreed that Alfonso would knight Edward before the wedding took place.|$|E

25|$|Roberts' {{own account}} {{mentions}} neither Demerara nor the slave revolt but his palpable aversion to slavery colors his negotiating stance, where subjects act as slaves to the king). By 1827, nearly impoverished by depredations of French and Spanish privateers on his {{ships in the}} West Indies, he chartered the Mary Ann to trade in the Indian Ocean. Roberts arrived in the port of Zanzibar in October 1827, and the next year, had an audience with the newly arrived Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, who was <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> to counterbalance British influence that he asked Roberts to escort some vessels to the United States to petition for trade; Roberts promised to bring the matter up with his Government. Upon returning, he wrote U.S. Senator Levi Woodbury, a personal friend, of the aggravations endured by American shipping, that might be alleviated by negotiating commercial treaties.|$|E
25|$|By April and May 1971, Genie's {{scores on}} the Leiter International Performance Scale tests had {{dramatically}} increased, with her overall mental age {{at the level of}} a typical 4-year-9-month-old, but on individual components she still showed a very high level of scatter. Her progress with language accelerated, and doctors noticed that the words she used indicated a fairly advanced mental categorization of objects and situations and focused on objective properties to a degree not normally found in children. Around that time, when a minor earthquake struck Los Angeles, she ran frightened into the kitchen and rapidly verbalized to some of the hospital cooks she had befriended, marking the first time she sought out comfort from another person and the first time she was so readily verbal. However, she still had a hard time being with large crowds of people; at her birthday party, she became <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> at all the guests present that she had to go outside with Rigler to calm down.|$|E
500|$|Joyce {{tested the}} sea-ice on 18 April {{and found it}} firm, but the {{following}} day a blizzard from the south swept all the ice away. The ambience at Hut Point was gloomy, and the unrelieved diet of seal was depressing. This seemed particularly to affect Mackintosh, and on 8 May, despite the urgent pleadings of Joyce, Richards and Ernest Wild, he decided to risk the re-formed ice and walk to Cape Evans. Victor Hayward volunteered to accompany him. Joyce recorded in his diary: [...] "I fail to understand how these people are <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> to risk their lives again". Shortly after their departure a blizzard descended, and the two were never seen again.|$|E

500|$|Based on the {{positive}} response he had received in San Francisco, MGM again cast Tracy as a priest in Boys Town (1938). Portraying Edward J. Flanagan, a Catholic priest and founder of Boys Town, was a role Tracy took seriously: [...] "I'm <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> {{to do a good}} job as Father Flanagan that it worries me, keeps me awake at night." [...] Tracy received strong reviews for his performance, and the movie grossed $4 million worldwide. For the second year running, Tracy received an Academy Award for Best Actor. He was humble about the recognition, saying in his acceptance speech: [...] "I honestly do not feel that I can accept this award... I can accept it only as it was meant to be for a great man—Father Flanagan". He immediately sent the Academy Award statuette to Flanagan. Tracy was listed as the fifth biggest money-making star of 1938.|$|E
500|$|Rowe {{announced}} {{that she was pregnant}} with Jackson's second child in November 1997. The baby was to be a girl and named Paris, after the French city in which her parents said she was conceived. On April 3, 1998, blue-eyed Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson was born. Her middle names come from Michael and his mother, Katherine. Jackson later claimed that he was <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> following the birth of his daughter, that he [...] "snatched" [...] her and ran straight home [...] "with all the placenta and everything all over her". Rowe later confirmed that Jackson had the placenta frozen. Following the birth, Jackson's associates contacted Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in Rome, {{in the hope that the}} Pontiff would personally baptize the pop star's daughter. An official for the Pope informed Jackson by letter that the leader of the Catholic Church would not participate in what may be perceived as a publicity stunt.|$|E
500|$|Ross and O'Reilly {{soon came}} to the usual {{division}} of labor between the director and assistant: the director would handle public affairs and make policy decisions as needed, while the assistant dealt with the day-to-day business of the bureau. Ross undertook a heavy travel schedule, visiting Mint facilities, making speeches backing Roosevelt, and campaigning for Democratic candidates in Wyoming. [...] This left O'Reilly running the Washington office as acting director. The two women carried on a businesslike but warm correspondence during these times, with O'Reilly writing to Ross (who had embarked {{on a tour of}} the mints) [...] "I am <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> to have your mind at ease about the office here [...] that I have resorted to rather frequent telegrams. [...] They are so much more direct and up to date than letters... my love to you and every good wish for the success of your visits to our beloved mint institutions." [...] Scheer suggests that O'Reilly would have found Ross's reports from the field valuable; they showed how the Mint recovered from the initial years of the Depression, when relatively few coins were produced, to the mid-1930s, when strong demand for coinage led the bureau to run the mints with two or even three shifts.|$|E

500|$|On May 18, 2011, 4s {{release date}} in the United States was {{confirmed}} on to be June 28. On June 7, the album was leaked onto the Internet in full; Beyoncé's legal representatives issued warnings to infringing websites and leaked tracks were soon removed from such sites. On June 9, Beyoncé responded to the leak through Facebook, commenting, [...] "My music was leaked and while {{this is not how}} I wanted to present my new songs, I appreciate the positive response from my fans. When I record music I always think about my fans singing every note and dancing to every beat. I make music to make people happy and I appreciate that everyone has been <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> to hear my new songs." [...] Following the leak, reports circulated that Columbia Records executives hoped to cover their assets in fear that the album may be a commercial failure. Rumors had suggested that the label requested from Beyoncé to make changes to the record and reunite Destiny's Child, claims Columbia denied. In August 2013, NME reported that Sony Music were suing a 47-year-old man from Gothenburg for US$233,000 concerning the leak of 4. The deluxe version was released simultaneously with the standard edition in several countries. In the United States, it was available exclusively through Target stores.|$|E
500|$|In July 1993, Weinberg had {{a chance}} {{sidewalk}} meeting outside Carnegie Deli with newly selected Late Night host Conan O'Brien, where Weinberg spoke about his ideas for music on the show. O'Brien promised Weinberg an audition. Within a few short days Weinberg put together The Max Weinberg 7, recruiting musicians he had worked with during his career including on the Killer Joe project, starting with guitarist and arranger Jimmy Vivino. Weinberg decided a muscular, drums-driven jump blues vibe, partly derived from the Killer Joe sound, is what he would use {{as a starting point}} for the group's sound. At the early August audition, the outfit impressed O'Brien with their ability to play not just rock but also rhythm and blues, soul, jazz, pop, and big band swing; Weinberg was <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> to land the job that he threw up afterward. After a final meeting with executive producer Lorne Michaels they were hired as the house band. The band performed on the show every night since its premiere on September 13, 1993. O'Brien later said of the Weinberg choice, [...] "The energy and enthusiasm of his music coincided with the show I wanted to do. Plus, his tan offset my ghostly complexion." [...] Weinberg held the title of music director on the show, while Vivino did most of the arranging. Of his career rebound, Weinberg said simply: [...] "I grabbed the brass ring twice." ...|$|E
500|$|Preparing for {{the episode}} was {{physically}} difficult {{for some of}} the cast members, most of whom had little experience singing and dancing. They spent three months in voice training. Two choreographers worked with Whedon and the cast on dance sequences. Michelle Trachtenberg (Dawn), who is trained in ballet, requested a dance sequence in lieu of a significant singing part, and Alyson Hannigan (Willow), according to Whedon, begged him not to give her many lines. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) told the BBC that [...] "It took something like 19hours of singing and 17hours of dancing in between shooting four other episodes" [...] and she was <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> about singing that she [...] "hated every moment of it". When Whedon suggested using a voice double for her, however, she said, [...] "I basically started to cry and said, 'You mean someone else is going to do my big emotional turning point for the season?' In the end, it was an incredible experience and I'm glad I did it. And I never want to do it again." [...] Davies was so impressed with Hinton Battle's performance on Broadway in The Wiz that he asked Battle to play the demon Sweet. Battle, a three-time Tony-winner, wore prosthetic make-up {{for the first time to}} give him a demonic red face. Sweet was portrayed as [...] "slick", smooth and stylish; in contrast, most demons on the series were designed to be crude and ugly. The set for The Bronze was used frequently throughout the series, but stairs were built from the stage to maximize floor space for Battle's dance.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1870s, Bean was {{operating}} a saloon in Beanville.

At the time, Bean and his wife were separated. Bean left his children with friends as he prepared to go west.|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversy}} has erupted on autism e-mail lists, where [...] "curebie" [...] {{is used as}} a derogatory term for parents who are portrayed as [...] "slaves to conformity, <b>so</b> <b>anxious</b> for their children to appear normal that they cannot respect their way of communicating". [...] These parents respond that this attitude shows [...] "a typical autistic lack of empathy by suggesting that they should not try to help their children". Lenny Schafer said that the autism-like lack of empathy of anti-cure activists prevent them from seeing what is in the hearts of pro-cure advocates.|$|E
