5|$|Former North Melbourne and Hawthorn player, Andrew Demetriou, was {{appointed}} {{as the new}} CEO. The new administration set about examining the views and wishes of players <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> negotiate a new CBA (1998–2003) with the AFL.|$|E
5|$|In May 1943, the Raymonds vouched for George Nakashima and his family, {{releasing}} {{them from}} a Japanese internment camp in Idaho, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> come and live at the New Hope farm.|$|E
5|$|McGrady {{was still}} {{recovering}} from surgery to begin the 2009–10 campaign. On December 15, he returned to action but was limited to only seven minutes off the bench. After six games, the Rockets decided to shut him down again <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> focus on trading him to another team.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the battle}} was over, Hitler {{and several of his}} {{followers}} killed themselves. The city's garrison surrendered on 2 May but fighting continued to the north-west, west, and south-west of the city {{until the end of the}} war in Europe on 8 May (9 May in the Soviet Union) as some German units fought westward <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> surrender to the Western Allies rather than to the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the Army also trained {{animals for}} use in the trenches. Dogs carried messages; horses, mules and dogs were used to lay {{telephone}} and telegraph cables. Carrier pigeons, who transported messages back from the front line, were also carried in tanks <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> deliver messages during an attack. Over 20,000 pigeons and 370 handlers were used during the war, and at times, they were the sole means of communication.|$|E
5|$|Flashbang Studios {{had planned}} to earn money from {{creating}} casual games <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> create a quirky game without {{having to worry about}} sales and sustaining the studio. Although the company failed to create a financially successful casual game, by creating software for other companies they managed to acquire enough money to undertake an unusual project of their own choosing.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, Himmler {{set up the}} Reichsschule für SS Helferinnen (Reich {{school for}} SS helpers) in Oberehnheim to train women in {{communications}} <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> free up men for combat roles. Himmler also intended to replace all female civilian employees in his service with SS-Helferinnen members, as they were selected and trained according to NSDAP ideology. The school was closed on 22 November 1944 due to the Allied advance.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Yunus was {{inspired}} during the Bangladesh famine of 1974 {{to make a}} small loan of US$27 to a group of 42 families as start-up money <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> make items for sale, without the burdens of high interest under predatory lending. Yunus believed that making such loans available to a larger population could stimulate businesses and reduce the widespread rural poverty in Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|Special {{weeks have}} also {{included}} shows featuring questions concerning specific topics, such as professional football, celebrity gossip, movies, and pop culture. During {{a week of}} episodes in November 2007, to celebrate the 1,000th episode of the syndicated Millionaire, all contestants that week started with $1,000 <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not leave empty-handed, and only had to answer ten questions to win $1,000,000. During that week, twenty home viewers per day also won $1,000 each.|$|E

5|$|The O class' design {{reflected}} {{their intended}} role; a heavy main armament (six 380mm guns in three dual turrets) for possible encounters with escorting -armed heavy cruisers, enough armor {{to defend against}} the same and nothing more, and a high top speed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> get away from slower but much better armored capital ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{dedicated}} but easily angered Djajakusuma {{was influenced}} by Usmar Ismail's realist views, although he focused more on traditional aspects of life. His theatrical performances attempted to modernise traditional forms <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be better received in a modern world. He is credited with revitalising the Betawi theatre form lenong and received numerous awards for his filmmaking, including a lifetime achievement award at the Indonesian Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|The new {{administration}} set about examining the views and wishes of players <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> negotiate a new CBA (1998–2003) with the AFL. The association developed {{a statement of}} purposes and objectives to assist with CBA negotiations. An advisory board of industry leaders was also assembled to direct the association into the future.|$|E

5|$|This deed won him great honour and fame: Praejecta, {{the widow}} of Areobindus and niece of Justinian, whom Guntharic was {{planning}} to marry, gave him a rich reward, while the emperor confirmed him as magister militum of Africa. Despite being already married to a relative of his, Artabanes eventually became engaged with Praejecta. He sent her back to Constantinople and himself asked from Justinian to be recalled from Africa, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> marry.|$|E
5|$|This time Robespierre did {{not defend}} Custine. Custine's lovely daughter-in-law came daily to the {{courthouse}} to sit at his feet; eventually, the prosecutors accused the judges of postponing a verdict <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> continue to gaze at her. The Revolutionary Tribunal convicted him of treason and he was executed by guillotine on the following day, 28 August 1793.|$|E
5|$|This time Thomas {{planned to}} launch {{simultaneous}} sorties from four gates. The main sector {{was to be}} again the Thomas gate, {{to take full advantage}} of the exhausted Muslim corps stationed there. The attacks from the other gates—Jabiya Gate, the Small Gate and the Eastern Gate—were intended to tie down the other Muslim corps <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not aid Shurhabil's corps at the Thomas gate.|$|E
60|$|Then the {{partners}} were {{at liberty to}} set about {{the work of the}} day; but it was now <b>so</b> late <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not expect to earn very much money.|$|R
50|$|After {{spending}} time {{with a variety of}} radical centrists, journalist Alec MacGillis concluded that their perspectives are <b>so</b> disparate <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> never come together to build a viable political organization.|$|R
60|$|The captain's prognostication as to {{the wind}} was verified, and to Frank's intense {{annoyance}} it gradually died away, and headed them <b>so</b> much <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> no longer lie their course.|$|R
5|$|A {{central part}} of Macdonald's case {{concerned}} the redistribution of wealth from richer provinces to poorer ones. His argument {{was based on the}} premise that richer provinces benefited from national economic policies such as high tariffs while poorer provinces were penalized by them. Macdonald suggested that compensatory subsidies to poorer, less-populated provinces be based on need, not population, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> pay for government services available in other parts of the country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation.|$|E
5|$|At the time, much of {{the rural}} ricelands had been {{abandoned}} due to war and lay fallow. The Americans pressured Diem to assume control of such lands and distribute it to the new settlers and {{to allow them to}} start their new lives and ease the overcrowding in the camps, but no action was taken in 1954. At the time, there was a severe wastage of personnel due to the placement of refugees in land that was inappropriate to them. Vietnamese officials had resolved to place the settlers in land similar to their northern origins <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be productive, but bureaucratic difficulties hampered COMIGAL and no plan was produced. Throughout 1954, 60% of the new arrivals identified themselves as having an agrarian background, but only 20% of the total refugees were placed in arable farming areas, meaning that at least 40% of the northerners were in areas not appropriate for their skill set. There were also severe problems in finding and then distributing farming equipment to the northerners <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> get to work and resuscitate the agricultural sector that was hindered by the war.|$|E
5|$|During Playford's rule, {{hospitals}} were overcrowded and the Royal Adelaide Hospital's beds were crammed {{together with a}} density twice higher than developed world standards. After a media exposé and criticism from health sector professionals, two more {{hospitals were}} built in the western and northern suburbs of Adelaide respectively. Playford's attitude to social welfare was also criticised. He said that it was up to charity, not the government, to support orphans and disadvantaged sectors of the community <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> enjoy a better standard of living. Spending on social welfare lagged behind that in other states, and legislative reforms on this front were non-existent.|$|E
