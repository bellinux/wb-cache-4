50|$|The {{subject of}} the four-voice fugue is made up entirely of sixteenth notes, with an implied pedal point set against a brief melodic subject that first falls, then rises. Such violinistic figures are {{frequently}} encountered in Baroque music and that of Bach, both as fugue subjects and as material in non-imitative pieces. Unusually, the answer is in the subdominant key, rather than the traditional dominant. Although technically a four-part fugue, {{most of the time}} there are only three voices, and some of the interludes are in two, or even one voice (notated as two). Although only simple triadic harmony is employed throughout the fugue, there is an unexpected C minor <b>subject</b> <b>entry,</b> and furthermore, a solo pedal statement of the subject - a unique feature for a Baroque fugue. Immediately after the final <b>subject</b> <b>entry,</b> the fugue resolves to a sustained B major chord.|$|E

5000|$|Section 3 (bars 36-56). At the cadence the fugue {{moves back}} into B minor. The musical texture becomes restless and eccentric; chromaticism returns and the rhythms, enlivened by semiquavers, become unsettling for the listener. The alto resumes the fugue subject {{followed}} by a stretto entry of the soprano in its higher register five beats later. The bass then takes up a dance-like accompaniment in [...] time, just before a stretto entry from the tenor. The bass continues for 6 bars of [...] time (i.e. [...] normal bars) introducing a short new motif involving a downwards drop of a fifth, linked to the fugue subject and already hinted at in the first section. The soprano plays the new motif in canon with the bass, until the bass resumes the subject, starting on the second beat of the bar, and the rhythm stabilises. The upper parts play {{a combination of the}} countersubject and the new motif and continue with them as an episode after the fugue subject ends. A further <b>subject</b> <b>entry</b> in the bass is {{followed by a}}nother episode based on the new motif as all the parts descend with chromaticisms to a cadence.|$|E

40|$|My {{presentation}} {{follows a}} set of logical arguments: 1. The vast majority of scholarly research addresses how one or more things affect in some way(s) one or more other things. This is true {{of much of the}} general literature too: (gardener) (grow) (flowers) (dogs) (bite) (mail carriers) [I illustrate this point in Szostak (2003). Note that works that describe only one thing will also be well handled by the classification outlined below. ] 2. If a book is about dogs biting mail carriers, the ideal <b>subject</b> <b>entry</b> is “(mail carriers) (bitten by) (dogs). ” The classification system then reflects the actual structure of works. 3. This is best done by allowing ‘things ’ (dogs, mail carriers) and ‘relationships ’ (biting) to be freely combined in both classification and search (In the right order, so as not to mistakenly recall the smaller but more intriguing literature on mail carriers biting dogs.). This spares the classificationist from having to enumerate a vast array of combinations, and the user from having to ascertain how a particular combination was treated. 4. The real beauty of this approach is that the terms “dog, ” “biting, ” and “mail carrier ” are far less ambiguous than any term the classificationist might have derived to capture this complex relationship. (Szostak, 2011). 5. So we simultaneously get: Subject headings that better capture the essence of work...|$|E

40|$|The traffic {{performance}} of a roundabout depends on {{the accuracy of the}} capacity models used for its design and analysis. However, the inconsistencies among the inputs for various existing models suggest that our understanding of the variables which impact on roundabout capacity remains limited. This paper thus presents the results of an investigation into the impact on entry capacity of the flows exiting on the same arm as the <b>subject</b> <b>entry,</b> as recent empirical research showed that this variable could explain more variation in entry capacity than other more commonly-used variables. Microscopic simulation models were developed for three entries of different-sized roundabouts, calibrated using ground-truth capacity data and follow-on headways. Experimental investigations revealed piecewise linear relationships between separation and capacity, which affected the direction and magnitude of the effect of exiting flows on capacity. At low separation distances, inhibitory effects (where the inability of entering drivers to distinguish circulating vehicles from exiting vehicles leads them to inadvertently reject acceptable gaps either wholly or partially) dominated and resulted in negative impacts by exiting flow. However, at separation distances larger than a critical distance threshold, exiting flows had near-linear positive relationship with entry capacity, arising possibly from their correlation with the proportion of circulating vehicles originating from the first entry immediately upstream. A new model was hypothesised based on these observations, and regressed on a large set of recent field data. The resulting new nonlinear regression model was found to perform well and provided a better explanation for the impacts of separation and exiting flow compared to those developed for the same dataset in a preceding study. By enabling {{a better understanding of the}} impacts of separation and exiting flow on capacity, this study hopes to contribute towards the development of improved roundabout capacity models...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to test the hypothesis that endogenous serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) would be inversely related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and that circulating concentrations ofDHEAS would increase along with favorable alterations in CVD risk factors as a result of resistive exercise training. Serum concentrations ofDHEAS, lipids, lipoproteins, and fasting insulin were determined along with estimates of total and regional body composition from anthropometry and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) in a crosssectional sample of premenopausal females aged 28 - 39 years (N= 96) and in a 12 month longitudinal subsample randomly assigned to exercise (n= 27) and control (n= 27) groups. The date of <b>subject</b> <b>entry</b> into the intervention trial ranged from mid-autumn to late winter. The percentage of total fat located on the trunk from DEXA (r= 0. 32, P= 0. 002) was positively correlated with DHEAS, whereas the percentage of total fat located on the legs from DEXA (r=- 0. 25, P= 0. 015) was inversely correlated with DHEAS after adjusting for age, smoking and fasting status. Because obesity may be a prerequisite for the metabolic aberrations commonly associated with fat distribution, subjects were also classified by DEXA-determined %Fat (≥ 30 vs < 30) as obese or nonobese. In obese but not nonobese women, indexes of upper body and/or truncal fat distribution were positively correlated (r= 0. 31 to 0. 51, P < 0. 05) with fasting insulin, triglycerides, total and LDL cholesterol and negatively correlated (r=- 0. 45, P < 0. 01) with HDL cholesterol. Correlations of similar magnitude yet opposite in direction were observed between indexes of lower body or leg fat distribution and metabolic CVD risk factors. DHEAS was inversely related to and accounted for 9. 0 % of the variation in LDL cholesterol after controlling for upper and lower body fat distribution and fasting insulin. DHEAS was also positively related to and accounted for 6. 8 % of the variation in HDL cholesterol after controlling for truncal fat percentage and distribution. Over the 12 month intervention, 42 subjects (18 controls and 24 exercisers) gained lean tissue mass (LTM) and 12 subjects (9 controls and 3 exercisers) lost LTM, whereas 26 subjects (15 controls and 11 exercisers) gained fat mass (FM) and 28 subjects (12 controls and 16 exercisers) lost FM. After adjusting for baseline HDL cholesterol, hematocrit change and subject study entry date, mean HDL cholesterol levels were significantly (P= 0. 026) maintained to a greater extent in LTM gainers (- 1. 3 %) than in LTM losers (- 15. 0 %). The HDL cholesterol-maintaining effect of gaining LTM was independent of control or exercise group status (P= 0. 042) and of the change in FM (P= 0. 015). The following was concluded from the study: 1.) increased amounts of total fat located on the trunk, and decreased amounts of total fat located on the legs, are associated with increased serum DHEAS concentrations in normally menstruating females; 2.) increased DHEAS levels are associated with decreased LDL and increased HDL cholesterol levels after controlling for the common associations of DHEAS and lipoproteins with fat distribution in obese premenopausal females; and 3.) the gain in soft tissue lean mass may prevent reductions in HDL cholesterol levels associated with lean tissue mass loss in healthy premenopausal females...|$|E
