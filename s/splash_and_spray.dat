50|$|The flow over a stepped {{spillway}} may {{be divided into}} three distinct flow regimes depending upon the flow rate for a given {{stepped spillway}} geometry: nappe, transition and skimming flow regimes with increasing flow rates.

The transition flows are observed {{for a range of}} intermediate discharges. Some strong hydrodynamic fluctuations, <b>splashing</b> <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> near the free surface constitute the main features of this flow regime.

40|$|Accidents {{caused by}} <b>splash</b> <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> are {{possibly}} underestimated in statistics, being classified, as they mostly are, as skidding accidents or rain and wet road accidents. In general such a specific problem has {{a relatively low}} rate in accident statistics. The problem often arises in critical circumstances such as rain, wind and overtaking. The <b>splash</b> <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> is caused by lorries mainly. Measures to prevent or decrease <b>splash</b> <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> {{can be divided into}} measures related to the road and measures related to the vehicle. Improvements for the road may be aimed at the prevention of the presence of water layers on the road. Changes to the vehicle can be divided into improvements for the tyres, aerodynamics and for the wheels. Besides energy saving, aerodynamic devices can be a means to diminish the spray and to prevent zones of low pressure at the wheels. For each type of vehicle different types of devices will be necessary. It is useful to make a difference between trucks and articulated vehicles. Shields on the wheels can be easily applied at low costs, and they can be of light weight material. Further research should be carried out on the effect of the development of heat in the brakes when such shields are applied. The relationship between the amount of <b>splash</b> <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> and visual hindrance has not been sufficiently studied. The relationship is not linear.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the cement {{characteristics}} and optical luminescence age of late Pleistocene-Holocene beachrock, exposed on the southeast shore of freshwater Lake Iznik in northwest Turkey, based on field observations, various spectroscopic analyses and optical dating results. The studied beachrock is a poorly-sorted coastal conglomerate composed mostly of gravels derived from surrounding volcanic rocks and marbles as well as quartz and carbonate grains. We identified different types of cements; dominated by micritic envelopes, bladed isopachous aragonite rims, void fills, radial aggregates and meniscus bridges, implying no single origin. Cementation characteristics indicate that marine-like cement micro-fabrics may occur in freshwater lake environments where the lake-water chemistry favors carbonate precipitation. OSL data revealed the existence of older beachrock dating back to 20. 2 ka, together with younger Holocene-age beachrock of between 5. 6 and 2. 4 ka. This suggests that younger beachrocks have been superimposed on older cemented carbonates through the removal of carbonates by wave motion (<b>splash</b> <b>and</b> <b>spray)</b> during lower lake level conditions.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} objectives for transportation engineers is to understand pavement surface properties and their positive and negative effects on the user. This can improve the design of the infrastructure, adequacy of tools, and consistency of methodologies that are essential for transportation practitioners regarding macrotexture characterization. Important pavement surface characteristics, or tire-pavement interactions, such as friction, tire-pavement noise, <b>splash</b> <b>and</b> <b>spray,</b> and rolling resistance, are significantly influenced by pavement macrotexture. This dissertation compares static and dynamic macrotexture measurements and proposes and enhanced method to quantify the macrotexture. Dynamic measurements performed with vehicle-mounted lasers have the advantage of measuring macrotexture at traffic speed. One drawback of these laser devices is the presence of “spikes ” in the collected data, which impact the texture measurements. The dissertation proposes two robust and innovative methods to overcome this limitation. The first method is a data-driven adaptive method that detects and removes the spikes from high-speed laser texture measurements. The method first calculates the discrete wavelet transform of the texture measurements. It then detects (at all levels) and removes the spikes from the obtained wavelet coefficient...|$|E
40|$|The {{improved}} {{ride quality}} and other possible safety {{benefits associated with}} New Generation Open-Graded Friction Course (NGOGFC) or Permeable Friction Course (PFC) pavements—better friction, lower noise, less <b>splash</b> <b>and</b> <b>spray,</b> higher visibility, reduced hydroplaning, and reduced nighttime surface glare in wet weather conditions—have made them highly attractive to engineers and contractors in the last 3 decades. Nevertheless, the durability problems and performance and maintenance issues exhibited by NGOGFCs under winter weather conditions, especially the fast formation of black ice, have prevented their widespread use. Recent research has investigated new preventive methods and materials for handling these winter maintenance issues and improving durability in NGOGFCs. In 2005, the Center for Transportation Research (CTR) conducted an online survey of different districts within the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) to gather information on NGOGFCs, and in 2004 – 2005 CTR conducted lab and field experiments to test the methodology for detecting black ice formation on NGOGFCs.

When the Del Fuegos hear the Wild Hogs riding back past the bar, they attempt to pursue them, only for the bikes to stall. Jack inadvertently drops his lit cigarette onto the ground, igniting the fuel leaking from the bikes which then causes the bar to explode. Woody, after witnessing the explosion from afar, convinces the others to keep riding. Eventually, the Wild Hogs run out of gas and end up in Madrid, New Mexico, where they stumble into a diner and help themselves to water and beer without first paying for the beer. As a result, the townspeople first mistake them for Del Fuegos. When the Wild Hogs explain their actions, they learn that the Del Fuegos have been terrorizing the town frequently, while the local police force are unable to do anything to protect the town. Although Woody is still antsy about the Del Fuegos, the others convince him to stay in the town overnight.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results {{of the largest and most}} comprehensive study to date on portland cement pervious concrete (PCPC). It is designed to be widely accessible and easily applied by designers, producers, contractors, and owners. The project was designed to begin with pervious concrete best practices and then to address the unanswered questions in a systematic fashion to allow a successful overlay project. Consequently, the first portion of the integrated project involved a combination of fundamental material property investigations, test method development, and addressing constructability issues before actual construction could take place. The second portion of the project involved actual construction and long-term testing before reporting successes, failures, and lessons learned. The results of the studies conducted show that a pervious concrete overlay can be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained. A pervious concrete overlay has several inherent advantages, including reduced <b>splash</b> <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> and reduced hydroplaning potential, as well as being a very quiet pavement.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on safety {{performance}} of new pavement surface types. Open graded or coarse-textured roadway surfaces are advisable for high-speed, wet-weather traffic conditions. They provide drainage relief at the tire-pavement interface, reduce the steepness of the speed gradient, decrease the likelihood of hydroplaning, minimize <b>splash</b> <b>and</b> <b>spray,</b> reduce the glare from wet pavements, and improve high-speed skid resistance. Before-and-after comparisons using historical collision data from California Traffic Accident Surveillance and Analysis System (TASAS) were conducted to assess the safety performance of three types of experimental pavement: open-graded asphalt concrete (OGAC), groove pavement (GP), and rubberized open-graded asphalt concrete (R-OGAC) projects implemented in recent years. Because these new types of pavement surfaces are expected to improve drainage, wet pavement related collisions were considered target collisions and analyzed in the before-and-after study. Our findings indicate that resurfacing with OGAC significantly decreased the number of wet-related collisions. However, no significant conclusions were drawn {{from the results of}} resurfacing with GP and R-OGAC, {{due to the lack of}} sufficient data. While further research is needed, findings from this current study suggest that new pavement types such as OGAC can improve the safety performance of roadways. Engineering...|$|E
40|$|With {{the goal}} of {{understanding}} how to mitigate the safety hazard of <b>splash</b> <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> around heavy vehicles, a computational study of the aerodynamics and spray dispersion about a simplified trailer wheel assembly has been completed. A tandem dual slick (TDS) wheel model that neglects complex geometric features such as brakes, wheel bolts and wheel cutouts but with the same dimensions as an actual trailer wheel assembly was used. A detailed simulation of the wheels alone demonstrated that the flow field is both unsteady and complex, containing a number of vortical structures that interact strongly with spray. Preliminary simulations with fenders and fairings demonstrated that these devices prevent the ballistic transport of drops larger than approximately 0. 1 mm, but the fine mist speculated {{to be responsible for}} visibility reduction is unaffected. This work suggests that to use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to design and evaluate spray mitigation strategies the jet or sheet breakup processes can be modeled using an array of injectors of small (< 0. 01 mm) water droplets; however the choice of size distribution, injection locations, directions and velocities is largely unknown and requires further study.

It is {{developed}} in a narrow strip just above the tide line on ancient limestone rocks. If you break off a piece, you will see that the black color is present near the surface and it grades to gray inside. Second, origin - it is being dissolved largely by algae, bacteria and fungi so it is often called [...] "biokarst". These tiny (microscopic) organisms bore into the rock and dissolve the calcite crystals. They are most dense within a centimeter or so at the surface, causing the black color. Why this results in the characteristic macro-texture is not fully understood, but you always see the two elements together so they must be linked somehow. It is clear that proximity to the marine environment is key. Maybe the <b>splash,</b> <b>spray</b> <b>and</b> mist from the waves breaking provide just enough moisture to sustain the algae.|$|R
40|$|Synthetic {{pesticides}} are extensively used {{in agriculture}} to control harmful pests and prevent crop yield losses or product damage. Because of high biological activity and, in certain cases, long persistence in the environment, pesticides may cause undesirable effects {{to human health}} and to the environment. Farmers are routinely exposed {{to high levels of}} pesticides, usually much greater than those of consumers. Farmers’ exposure mainly occurs during the preparation and application of the pesticide <b>spray</b> solutions <b>and</b> during the cleaning-up of spraying equipment. Farmers who mix, load, <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> pesticides can be exposed to these chemicals due to spills <b>and</b> <b>splashes,</b> direct <b>spray</b> contact as a result of faulty or missing protective equipment, or even drift. However, farmers can be also exposed to pesticides even when performing activities not directly related to pesticide use. Farmers who perform manual labor in areas treated with pesticides can face major exposure from direct spray, drift from neighboring fields, or by contact with pesticide residues on the crop or soil. This kind of exposure is often underestimated. The dermal and inhalation routes of entry are typically the most common routes of farmers’ exposure to pesticides. Dermal exposure during usual pesticide handling takes place in body areas that remain uncovered by protective clothing, such as the face and the hands. Farmers’ exposure to pesticides can be reduced through less use of pesticides and through the correct use of the appropriate type of personal protective equipment in all stages of pesticide handling...|$|R

The influence of asphalt mixture design parameter such as the porosity, the maximum sizes of the aggregate, gradation and asphalt on the drainage and counter-clogging ability of porous asphalts was researched. The tests indicated that the porosity has an obvious influence on both porous asphalts’ permeable ability and counter-clogging ability. Comparing the specimen of 21 % void to the ones of 16 % void, the drain ability is improved 49. 8 %, the counter-clogging ability is improved 55. 0 %. The maximum sizes of the aggregate has an obvious influence on porous asphalts’ counter-clogging ability, but no an obvious influence on the drain ability.

40|$|Motion generates {{sound or}} noise; unless {{the sound is}} audible, motion seen nearby seems either {{stealthy}} or illusionary. Pitch, or frequency, is associated with speed. Loudness is associated with distance {{and the power of}} the generator. Loud noises are awesome and ominous. Music remains inexplicable. Sound pressure is proportional to the number of generators. Noise from motor vehicles is generated by engine accessories, exhaust, engine knock, air flow, rattles, and tires on the pavement. A few years ago, considerable study was devoted to the squeal of tires while cornering, braking, and accelerating. Indeed, the squeal has been abated. Knobby tires, bald tires, and studded tires generate more noise than ribbed and siped tires. Knobbly treads generate vibrations in the casing of the tire. Tires in traction cause the tread rubber to stretch (shear) in proportion to the force; slippage and "snap-back " likely occurs. Air pocketed in tread cavities and compressed under the footprint of the tire may induce whistles or pops.

40|$|Introduction This study aims {{to compare}} the rate of intra-operative {{contamination}} in primary total knee replacement with the body exhaust suit and conventional gowns. Materials and Methods In this randomized study, 64 TKAs of 32 patients were recruited. A pre-operation screen was needed to assess the feasibility and necessity to conduct bilateral TKA operation on schedule. Those eligible to the inclusion criteria were taken in to the study after being informed the consent. The study was {{divided into two groups}} randomly. Conventional gowns group (n= 31), the whole surgical team wore conventional gowns during the TKA surgery; Space suit group (n= 31), the whole surgical team wore space suits during the TKA surgery. The bilateral arthroplasty was performed by the two groups in sequence and the sequence was randomly generated from a computer. The surgeons in both team didn’t know the sequence of another team. The space suit included disposable hoods and masks. The scrub nurse should wear space suits during the whole operation. Double gloving was a necessary procedure for all surgeons. All operations were performed in routine technique aims to restore the neutral mechanical lower limb alignment. Microbiological assay was the crucial component of the whole process. Wound swabs for bacteria culture were collected immediately after skin incision. Subcutaneous layer after skin incision (skin pre-op). Proximal tibia bone cut surface before implantation (tibia). Distal femoral bone cut surface before implantation (femur). Anterior femoral condyle (prosthesis) before arthrotomy closure (implant). Subcutaneous layer before skin closure (skin post-op). Patient specimens were processed immediately after their arrival at the laboratory. Cultivation of tissue samples was performed essentially as described in previous study. In order to guarantee the recovery of the patients and the whole study smoothly conducted, lower limb radiography is needed to assess the restore of the mechanical axis. Result Among the 31 patients recruited, there were 21 females (67 %) and 10 males (23 %). The body mass index (BMI) was 27. 43 ± 4. 97 kg/m 2. 86. 67 % were over-weight (BMI > 23 kg/m 2) and 38. 71 % were obese (BMI > 30 kg/m 2). The operation time of the whole surgery was 175. 61 ± 46. 71 min. Lower limb alignment with space suit was 15. 03 ± 8. 44 ° varus. Lower limb alignment with conventional gown was 14. 82 ± 6. 76 ° varus. The operation time with space suit was 85. 39 ± 19. 48 min; the operation time with conventional gown was 86. 10 ± 31. 45 min. The number of times the surgeon changed gloves were 0. 77 ± 1. 45 in space suit group and 1. 71 ± 1. 51 in conventional gown group. The number of times the surgeon touched helmet was 0. 06 ± 0. 25. There {{was no significant difference in}} the operation time (P > 0. 05) and varus angulation (P > 0. 05) between the two groups. However, the glove changing times with conventional gown was significant increased when compared with the space suit group (P < 0. 05). Various strains of bacteria were tested in the culture and the bacterial culture results of the specimens were negative in the two groups. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that there is no benefit in the use of body exhaust suit in decreasing the rate of wound contamination when compared with the conventional gown. The suit is not a must to prevent PJI. However, although there's still a lot to improve, the modern positive-pressure surgical helmet body exhaust systems can be considered as a protection device to protect the blood, soft tissue, bone crumbles from splashing on the performers’ skin. Considering the large amount of <b>splashes</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprays</b> in the orthopedic procedures, the body exhaust systems should be mandatory during the procedure of TKA. published_or_final_versionOrthopaedics and TraumatologyMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|R
40|$|Spray cooling {{has high}} {{potential}} in thermal management and {{life support systems}} by overcoming the deleterious effect of microgravity upon two-phase heat transfer. In particular spray cooling offers several advantages in heat flux removal that include the following: 1) By maintaining a wetted surface, spray droplets impinge upon a thin fluid film rather than a dry solid surface; 2. Most heat transfer surfaces will not be smooth but rough. Roughness can enhance conductive cooling, aid liquid removal by flow channeling; <b>and</b> 3. <b>Spray</b> momentum {{can be used to}} a) substitute for gravity delivering fluid to the surface, b) prevent local dryout and potential thermal runaway and c) facilitate liquid and vapor removal. Yet high momentum results in high We and Re numbers characterizing the individual spray droplets. Beyond an impingement threshold, droplets splash rather than spread. Heat flux declines <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> cooling efficiency can markedly decrease. Accordingly we are investigating droplet impingement upon a) dry solid surfaces, b) fluid films, c) rough surfaces <b>and</b> determining <b>splashing</b> thresholds <b>and</b> relationships for both dry surfaces and those covered by fluid films. We are presently developing engineering correlations delineating the boundary between <b>splashing</b> <b>and</b> non-splashing regions. Determining the splash/non-splash boundary is important for many practical applications. Coating and cooling processes would each benefit from near-term empirical relations and subsequent models. Such demonstrations can guide theoretical development by providing definitive testing of its predictive capabilities. Thus, empirical relations describing the boundary between <b>splash</b> <b>and</b> non-splash are given for drops impinging upon a dry solid surface and upon a thin fluid film covering a similar surface. Analytical simplification of the power laws describing the boundary between the <b>splash</b> <b>and</b> non-splash regions yields insight into the engineering parameters governing the <b>splash</b> <b>and</b> non-splash outcomes of the fluid droplets. The power law correlation is shown separating the splashing versus non-splashing regions as developed for droplets impinging upon a dry solid surface. Splashing upon a dry surface is reasonably described by Ca greater than 0. 85, reflecting the competing roles of surface tension and viscosity. The power law correlation is shown separating the splashing versus non-splashing regions as developed for droplets impinging upon a thin fluid film covering the solid surface. Splashing upon a thin fluid film, as described by v (pd/s) greater than 63, is governed by fluid density and surface tension, but is rather independent of viscosity. Finally, the data presented here suggests that a more direct dependence upon the surface tension and viscosity, given a better understanding of their interplay, would allow accurate description of the droplet-surface impacts for more complicated situations involving non-Newtonian fluids, specifically those exhibiting viscoelastic behavior...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{a method for}} modeling and rendering dynamic behavior of fluids withsplashes and foam. A particle system is built into a fluid simulation system to represent an ocean wavecresting <b>and</b> <b>spraying</b> over another object. We use the Cubic Interpolated Propagation (CIP) method asthe fluid solver. The CIP method can solve liquid and gas together {{in the framework of}} fluid dynamicsand has high accuracy in the case of relatively coarse grids. This enables us to simulate the fluids in ashort time and describe the motion of splashes in the air that is associated with the liquid motion well. The foam floating on the water also can be described using the particle system. We integrate the rigidbody simulation with the fluid and particle system to create sophisticated scenes including splashes andfoam. We construct state change rules that are used with the particle system. This controls the generation,vanishing and transition rule of <b>splashes</b> <b>and</b> foam. The transition rule makes the seamless connection betweena <b>splash</b> <b>and</b> foam. We employed a fast volume rendering method with scattering effect for particles. One of the important features of our method is the combination of fast simulation and rendering techniques,which provides dynamic and realistic scenes in a short time...|$|R
