5|$|Builders took {{advantage}} of available geological features when constructing the tombs. Some tombs were quarried out of existing limestone clefts, others behind slopes of <b>scree,</b> or were {{at the edge of}} rock spurs created by ancient flood channels.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} tombs {{were located}} in cliffs {{at the top of}} <b>scree</b> slopes, under storm-fed waterfalls (KV34 and KV43). As these locations were filled, burials descended to the valley floor, gradually moving back up the slopes as the valley bottom filled with debris. This explains the location of the tombs KV62 and KV63 buried in the valley floor.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus helenae is {{a species}} of fungus in the genus Cyathus, family Nidulariaceae. Like {{other members of the}} Nidulariaceae, C.helenae resembles a tiny bird's nest filled with 'eggs'â€”spore-containing {{structures}} known as peridioles. It was initially described by mycologist Harold Brodie in 1965, who found it growing on mountain <b>scree</b> in Alberta, Canada. C.helenaes life cycle allows it to reproduce both sexually and asexually. One of the smaller species of Cyathus, C.helenae produces a number of chemically unique diterpenoid molecules known as cyathins. The specific epithet of this species was given by Brodie in tribute to his late wife Helen.|$|E
50|$|A weep <b>screed</b> or sill <b>screed</b> is a <b>screed</b> rail {{which has}} {{drainage}} holes to allow moisture which penetrated an exterior plaster or stucco coating to drain through the <b>screed.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Screed</b> {{has three}} {{meanings}} in building construction. 1) a flat board (<b>screed</b> board, floating <b>screed)</b> or a purpose-made aluminium tool used to smooth and true materials like concrete, stucco and plaster {{after it has}} been placed on a surface or to assist in flattening; 2) a strip of plaster or wood applied to a surface to act as a guide for a <b>screed</b> tool (<b>screed</b> rail, <b>screed</b> strip, <b>screed</b> batten); 3) the material itself which has been flattened with a <b>screed</b> (<b>screed</b> coat). In the UK, <b>screed</b> has also come to describe a thin, top layer of material (traditionally sand and cement), poured in site on top of the structural concrete or insulation, on top of which other finishing materials can be applied, or it can be left bare to achieve a raw effect.|$|R

5|$|The 1908 Ordnance Survey map of Gibraltar reveals Flat Bastion Magazine {{within the}} east side of the bastion. The British version of the {{magazine}} dates back to at least 1873, as documented on a keystone above one of the magazine's doorways (pictured right). It is considered likely that a magazine was present at that site previously. The magazine was constructed on <b>scree</b> breccia, with underlying limestone bedrock. The road through the bastion is positioned just to the west of the magazine.|$|E
5|$|The most {{widespread}} {{species is}} the brown bear, which occurs from Western Europe eastwards through Asia {{to the western}} areas of North America. The American black bear is restricted to North America, and the polar bear is restricted to the Arctic Sea. All the remaining species of bear are Asian. They occur {{in a range of}} habitats which include tropical lowland rainforest, both coniferous and broadleaf forests, prairies, steppes, montane grassland, alpine <b>scree</b> slopes, Arctic tundra {{and in the case of}} the polar bear, ice floes. Bears may dig their dens in hillsides or use caves, hollow logs and dense vegetation for shelter.|$|E
5|$|Whelp Side, between Whelpside Gill and Mines Gill, {{appears as}} a {{distinct}} shoulder of the mountain when seen from the west, largely grassy though with a few crags and boulders in places, and with coniferous plantations on its lower slopes which were planted to stabilise the land around the reservoir. North of Mines Gill are the Helvellyn Screes, a more craggy stretch of hillside, beneath the north-west ridge, with a loose <b>scree</b> covering in places.|$|E
50|$|The paver {{should provide}} a smooth uniform surface behind the <b>screed.</b> In order to provide a smooth surface a free {{floating}} <b>screed</b> is used. It is towed {{at the end of}} a long arm which reduces the base topology effect on the final surface. The height of the <b>screed</b> is controlled by a number of factors including the attack angle of the <b>screed,</b> weight and vibration of the <b>screed,</b> the material head and the towing force.|$|R
50|$|A {{development}} in the UK is the delivery, mixing, and pumping of <b>screed</b> from a single vehicle. Where previously <b>screed</b> jobs required a separate pump to administer the <b>screed,</b> these new machines can now administer the <b>screed</b> directly from the mixing pan to the floor at a range of up to 60 meters. For example, the material called granolithic.|$|R
50|$|In {{concrete}} work a <b>screed</b> batten is {{fixed to the}} formwork to smoothly guide a <b>screed</b> smoothing tool.|$|R
5|$|At higher elevations, {{mountain}} hemlock and subalpine fir are {{the most}} common trees. Alaska cedar and whitebark pine are also present. However, as the elevation increases, the forest becomes increasingly fragmented, and is interspersed with meadows consisting of grasses, herbs, and shrubs. <b>Scree</b> slopes are also common. Temperatures can vary greatly within one day due to the high altitude of the habitat and lack of forest cover. For the same reasons, the parkland also experiences increased solar radiation. At the upper edge of the parkland, trees tend to be stunted, and grow in small clumps. Common shrubs include heather and mountain huckleberry. Off-trail hiking can be very destructive in the sub-alpine zone.|$|E
5|$|Classic {{examples}} are {{found at the}} Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just {{to the north of}} the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the teeth on a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in <b>scree</b> deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels nest colonially, for {{the most}} part on islands, {{although}} a few species breed on the mainland, particularly Antarctica. Nesting sites are attended nocturnally in order to avoid predators; the wedge-rumped storm petrels nesting in the Galapagos Islands are the exception to this rule and attend their nesting sites during the day. Storm petrels display high levels of philopatry, returning to their natal colonies to breed. In one instance a band-rumped storm petrel was caught as an adult 2m from its natal burrow. Storm petrels nest either in burrows dug into soil or sand, or in small crevices in rocks and <b>scree.</b> Competition for nesting sites is intense in colonies where storm petrels compete with other burrowing petrels, with shearwaters having been recorded killing storm petrels in order to occupy their burrows. Colonies can be extremely large and dense densities as high as 8 pairs/m2 for band-rumped storm petrels in the Galapagos and colonies 3.6 million strong for Leach's storm petrel have been recorded.|$|E
5000|$|The free {{floating}} <b>screed</b> has become standard {{because of the}} smoothing or averaging effect it can have on the existing base course. Since the only connection between the asphalt paver and the <b>screed</b> is the tow arm, the <b>screed</b> can [...] "float" [...] vertically relative to the paver. This allows the paver to traverse uneven ground while the <b>screed</b> floats over the material {{placed in front of}} it.|$|R
50|$|If each {{of these}} forces is constant, {{altering}} {{the angle of the}} <b>screed</b> to the horizontal (angle of attack) will control the amount of material extruded behind the <b>screed.</b> Increasing the angle of attack will cause the <b>screed</b> to climb higher through the pile of material, and therefore raise its trailing edge, increasing the amount of material extruded behind the <b>screed.</b> Similarly, reducing the angle of attack will reduce the amount of material extruded.|$|R
50|$|This {{sense of}} <b>screed</b> has been {{extended}} to asphalt paving where a free floating <b>screed</b> {{is part of a}} machine which spreads the pavement.|$|R
5|$|The Atlantic puffin is {{sexually mature}} {{at the age}} of four to five years. The birds are colonial nesters, {{excavating}} burrows on grassy clifftops or reusing existing holes, and may also nest in crevices and amongst rocks and <b>scree</b> on occasion. It is in competition with other birds and animals for burrows. It can excavate its own hole or move into a pre-existing system dug by a rabbit and has been known to peck and drive off the original occupant. Manx shearwaters also nest underground and often live in their own burrows alongside puffins, and their burrowing activities may break through into the puffin's living quarters resulting in the loss of the egg. They are monogamous (they mate for life) and give biparental care to their young. The male spends more time guarding and maintaining the nest while the female is more involved in incubation and feeding the chick.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} this species {{includes}} Northern Arkansas and southern Missouri, East to the Appalachian Mountains and Ohio River Basin, North into New England, southern Ontario and Quebec. Distribution of the bats is spotty within their entire range, and they {{are considered to be}} very uncommon. These bats prefer to reside in deciduous or coniferous forests. They are active in mountain ranges from 240â€“1125 meters in height. During the spring, summer, and autumn they prefer to roost at emergent rock-outcrops such as cliffs, bluffs, shale barrens, and talus slopes, as well as man-made structures, including buildings, joints between segments of cement guard rails, turnpike tunnels, road-cuts, and <b>scree</b> covered dams. The largest populations of Myotis leibii have been found in New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Western Virginia. (red list) The total count of individuals in all hibernacula in which they have been found is 3,000, with roughly 60% of the total number from just two sites in New York. Unfortunately, 90% of their habitat is on private land which makes it difficult to protect them.|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament adds new modes: Leagues, Time Trials, Single Race, and Tournaments. In League mode, players {{compete for}} points in divisions. Seasons consist of four races. Players {{with the most}} points {{at the end of}} the season are {{promoted}} to the next division, and players with the least are relegated. Time Trial mode is where players race alone (although some tracks have a Shadow Racer representing the best time) for the best time, or to practise driving. Single Race is where players compete in a series of rounds in which vehicles begin at the centre of the <b>scree,</b> and get further apart as the race progresses. If a vehicle goes off the screen, they are out of the race unless they have travelled the furthest. The game ends when only one player remains. Tournaments are a fixed race series played in the same manner as Single Races. The winner is the first player to win a set number of times. There are two multiplayer-only modes: Knockout and Share Games. Knockout involves a series of races similar to tournament mode, with winners progressing to the next round and losers knocked out. Share Games is similar to Single Race, but cars are coloured according to team, with each team's finishing position depending on which member performs the best. The Mega Drive J-Cart provides two controller ports, enabling up to eight players in multiplayer by two players sharing the controllers. The Game Gear version retains the console sharing (two player sharing one console) function of the original, and two units can be linked.|$|E
50|$|The free {{floating}} <b>screed</b> {{has a number}} of forces acting on it that, when in equilibrium, allow the depth behind the <b>screed</b> to be constant.|$|R
