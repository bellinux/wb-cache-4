500|$|More fiction work {{dealing with}} the Bogdan-Pitești circle was {{published}} from a casual contributor to Seara, Lucrezzia Karnabatt. In her 1922 novel, Demoniaca, she portrays her employer as [...] "Basile Dan", a sinister traitor of his country and a cynical pornographer. Ion Călugăru used Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești as the inspiration for [...] "Alexandru Lăpușneanu", the boyar character in his novel Don Juan Cocoșatul ("Don Juan the Hunchback"). Literary historian George Călinescu notes that this fictional portrait shows: [...] "The dignity in gossip, the boyar carriage, the refinement that the apparent vulgarity cannot bring to ruin, the blasé and cynical lechery [...]" [...] In one episode in the book, Lăpușneanu simulates agony and receives a Catholic confession that (he insists) must be read in Latin instead of French; elsewhere, Lăpușneanu's eccentric and adulterous wife Fetița ("Little Girl") <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a battlefield, wearing {{nothing more than a}} swimsuit.|$|E
500|$|Gust fronts create {{low-level}} {{wind shear}} {{which can be}} hazardous to planes when they takeoff or land. [...] Flying insects are swept along by the prevailing winds. [...] As such, fine line patterns within weather radar imagery, associated with converging winds, are dominated by insect returns. [...] At the surface, clouds of dust can be raised by outflow boundaries. If squall lines form over arid regions, a duststorm known as a haboob can result from the high winds picking up dust in their wake from the desert floor. [...] If outflow boundaries move into areas of the atmosphere which are stable in the low levels, such as over colder pockets of ocean or through the cold sector of extratropical cyclones, they can create a phenomenon known as an undular bore, which <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> satellite and radar imagery {{as a series of}} transverse waves in the cloud field oriented perpendicular to the low-level winds.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} the music video was a joint {{collaboration}} between Gaga and Lawrence. Originally, the video {{was going to be}} shot in New York City, with more elaborate sets, including sets outdoors. The idea was scrapped, however, for budgetary reasons: [...] the budget for the video was low and there was no product placement. Because of Gaga's schedule, the video was shot in Los Angeles over a two-day period. Lawrence described Gaga's work ethic and creativity during the video shoot: [...] "She loves the art form of music videos and she is a real creative partner and has great ideas and really cool and unique tastes. She has a great team working with her as well, helping build really fantastic things that she wears. She works hard, she <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> time and she's pretty spontaneous ... it was great ... if she had a new song and wanted to do something, I would do it in a second.

500|$|Gameplay in Devil May Cry 4 {{is similar}} to {{previous}} games in the series. The player must fight through levels called [...] "missions", occasionally solving puzzles or gathering items. Performance in a mission is graded from D being the bottom grade through C, B, A, S, SS, and SSS being the highest grade. Grades are based on items used, Red Orbs gathered, time taken, {{and the amount of}} Style Points accumulated. Each Style Point grade has its own tag-word. The stylish grade <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the side of the screen and starts at [...] "Deadly"(D); progresses through [...] "Carnage"(C), [...] "Brutal"(B), and [...] "Atomic"(A); then, progresses through one last bar of grade containing the phrases [...] "Smokin'"(S), [...] "Smokin' Style"(SS), and lastly [...] "Smokin' Sick Style"(SSS). Stylish combat is the main focus of the game, which is conveyed through unbroken combos of varied attacks while avoiding damage. The player must avoid enemy attacks to continue performing combos, often by memorizing attack patterns. The Devil Trigger is a super state that enables the player to become more powerful adding a slow but steady health regeneration, with increased damage done. Devil Trigger can be activated by pressing the button to trigger it when the minimum amount on the gauge is filled.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline a [...] "much less extreme reversal" [...] of the season two episode [...] "The Story on Page One", in which Peter {{attempts}} to seduce actor Luke Perry. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "It was disappointing to see Family Guy bury a guest star like Kaitlin Olson in the background for much of her episode as Quagmire's sister last week, but it was even worse {{to see the show}} waste Ryan Reynolds." [...] He continued, [...] "He may not fit an empirical definition of a movie star, but I think he’s worth more as a guest than a tired trope like playing himself as a sexual predator towards Peter." [...] McFarland also criticized the episode's two storylines, noting, [...] "Both plots paint themselves into a corner with no time to get out. In the third act, Stewie is trapped at Consuela's house and Peter hadn't succumbed to Reynolds' repetitive and slowly escalating advances or done anything about them, so the show snaps its fingers and ends each one prematurely." [...] He graded the episode as a C-. In a much more positive review, Terron R. Moore of Ology criticized the episode for not featuring Griffin family siblings Chris and Meg, but praised the series for adopting a Stewie-centric storyline. Moore noted of the storyline involving Reynolds, [...] "All pretty funny stuff, but Ryan Reynolds' entire guest slot is {{based on the fact that}} you like Ryan Reynolds and his occasionally homoerotic humor, which I can definitely appreciate." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "Not the best Family Guy, but a definite improvement on the week before, using some of the elements it knows best." [...] Andy Neuenschwander of Yidio also gave mixed reaction to the episode, writing, [...] "Something happens whenever a celebrity <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> [...] "Family Guy" [...] and plays themselves. I can't quite put my finger on it, but everything just feels a bit off. This episode, which featured Ryan Reynolds as Ryan Reynolds, only confirmed that feeling." [...] He also compared it to The Simpsons, noting, [...] "Maybe it's the way the celebrity is treated as a character: in shows like The Simpsons, celebrities who play themselves appear as a relatively normal version of themselves [...] But on Family Guy, celebrities tend to appear as some bizarro version of themselves." ...|$|E

Since the aliens knocked over the {{satellite}} dish Ricky and Tom are sent to fix it. Ricky then reveals to Tom that he lied about his car breaking down, and his age; Ricky is actually in college and is 21 years old, five years older than Bethany. Ricky makes Tom fix the satellite dish by himself but it is beyond repair. Investigating further, Tom and Jake (who unexpectedly <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the roof) discover the aliens.

2500|$|Andrew Unterberger of {{the website}} PopDust wrote that Flo Rida was [...] "exactly" [...] what the {{original}} version of [...] "We Found Love" [...] was missing. He added, [...] "No Rihanna, you got it backwards—it's Flo Rida who needs to have other, more talented people on his songs in order {{to turn them into}} hits, not the other way around... At least this remix does feature a sizeable contribution from Flo, as he <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> both the intro and over the song's primary instrumental hook with his trademark unintelligble yammering, though he gets in at least one reference to rocking a party 'like I'm Mick Jagger.'" [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone praised the remix of the song, saying that [...] "once again, Flo Rida shows his true rapping skills over the beat of Rihanna's 'We Found Love'". Both Billboards Erika Ramirez and Spins Marc Hogan praised the remixed version calling it [...] "refreshing" [...] and [...] "interesting". However, Becky Bain of the website Idolator was more negative towards the remix. She noted, [...] "Being that Rihanna's 'We Found Love' has enough beats and synths to be its own remix, not to mention it couldn't possibly be even more popular on the Hot 100... we find it pointless to release {{a new version of the}} single with Flo Rida." ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{diagnosis}} can be difficult, {{especially when}} other severe injuries are present; thus {{the condition is}} commonly diagnosed late. Chest X-ray {{is known to be}} unreliable in diagnosing diaphragmatic rupture; it has low sensitivity and specificity for the injury. [...] Often another injury such as pulmonary contusion masks the injury on the X-ray film. [...] Half the time, initial X-rays are normal; in most of those that are not, hemothorax or pneumothorax is present. However, there are signs detectable on X-ray films that indicate the injury. [...] On an X-ray, the diaphragm may appear higher than normal. [...] Gas bubbles may appear in the chest, and the mediastinum may appear shifted to the side. A nasogastric tube from the stomach may appear on the film in the chest cavity; this sign is pathognomonic for diaphragmatic rupture, but it is rare. [...] A contrast medium that <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> X-ray can be inserted through the nasogastric tube to make a diagnosis. [...] The X-ray is better able to detect the injury when taken from the back with the patient upright, but this is not usually possible because the patient is usually not stable enough; thus it is usually taken from the front with the patient lying supine. Positive pressure ventilation helps keep the abdominal organs from herniating into the chest cavity, but this also can prevent the injury from being discovered on an X-ray.|$|E

Bart, whose involvement with the prank was not discovered, promises to visit Milhouse every day. Homer drops Bart off at Springfield Retirement Castle to visit Grandpa. There, Bart is immediately smitten with a kind and charitable girl named Jenny.

He continues to say that he is changed completely because of being with her. Jenny, though momentarily pleased by Bart's honesty, realizes she cannot forgive or trust Bart, and angrily dumps him. At home, Bart cries, and Homer & Marge console and reassure him that girls come and go, but he still has his family, only for him to cry even harder, and for Homer to shed tears too.|$|E

Beast is too miserable from Belle's {{departure}} {{to respond to a}} challenge from Gaston, although his servants manage to beat back the villagers. [...] Upon seeing Belle's return to the castle, the Beast's mood is roused and he duels Gaston upon the castle rooftops. The Beast uses guile to make up for his lack of weaponry, and remains unfazed by frequent taunts from Gaston, who proclaims that handsome appearance is the entitlement to Belle. The Beast eventually overpowers Gaston and intends to drop him until the hunter begs him not to. [...] Not wanting to sink to Gaston's level of behavior, the Beast decides to show mercy and spare Gaston on the condition that he immediately leave the castle. Belle then <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the balcony and the Beast climbs up to meet her; however Gaston refuses to accept defeat and stabs the Beast from behind. Gaston loses his balance and falls from the castle roof to his death, but Belle manages to grab the Beast and pull him up. The Beast, knowing he is mortally wounded, expresses his appreciation to Belle for returning and being able to see her one last time, before falling unconscious and apparently succumbing to his injuries. [...] Belle is able to tell the Beast that she loves him before the final petal falls. Then, Belle's declaration of love for the Beast breaks the spell and transforms him back into the prince.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the events of Schism, Cyclops thanks Wolverine for always being there for him as they seem to finally have come to a mutually spoken and understood respect for each other after years of fighting and rivalry. While at a conference for weapon control, Kid Omega (Quentin Quire) launches a psychic terrorist attack on the ambassadors present. In response, Sentinels are deployed at the conference and are disposed of by Cyclops and Wolverine. Due to growing fears of mutant threat, countries around the world begin to mobilize their Sentinel forces. As Cyclops begins to deploy X-Men around the globe to deal with the threat, Wolverine returns to Utopia to find Hope Summers and the Lights waiting for their combat training lesson. After insulting Hope's team and realizing that Idie is losing her childhood, Wolverine asks Kitty Pryde to make him a doll to give to Idie. Wolverine gives the doll to Idie and eats ice cream with her while news reports of Sentinel activity play and tensions build around Utopia. Sometime after, Kid Omega <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Utopia. Wolverine tries to attack Kid Omega when Cyclops stops him. While Cyclops sends a team of some of his most powerful X-Men, {{as well as some of}} the island students, to a local mutant museum exhibit as a [...] "show of force", Wolverine goes to a local bar to sulk in his aggravation with the current situation. The new Hellfire Club attacks the exhibit and incapacitates all senior X-Men present. As Wolverine rushes to the museum to help from the bar and Cyclops flies in from Utopia, Idie asks if she should kill the Hellfire Club to help. While Wolverine protests against it profusely, Cyclops tells Idie to do what she feels is right. Idie kills almost every Hellfire Club member left to save her friends and mentors. Wolverine pops his claws at Cyclops in anger that he used a child to save the day, but restrains himself when he realizes what he is doing.|$|E
