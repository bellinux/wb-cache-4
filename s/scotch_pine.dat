5|$|Robert Shaffer defined four {{forms of}} R.densifolia in a 1962 {{monograph}} on section Compactae, differentiating them by spore print color, fruiting pattern, odor, gill spacing, {{and the intensity}} of the color change with bruising. Three forms are from the Pacific Northwest region of North America: form dilatoria has fruit bodies that darken to lavender gray to brownish gray; form fragrans has a fragrant odor and widely spaced gills; form cremeispora produces a light yellow spore print and has an obscurely two-layered cap cuticle. Form gregata, found in the eastern United States, grows gregariously in jack pine and <b>Scotch</b> <b>pine</b> forests. The nomenclatural database Index Fungorum lumps these forms, as well as f. subrubescen, published by Patrick Reumaux in 1996, together into synonymy. Other synonyms include Rolf Singer's 1931 variety caucasica, Roger Heim's 1938 variety latericola, and C. Dagron's 1999 variety colettarum.|$|E

6000|$|At first some oaks {{had been}} planted by themselves, and others mixed with Scotch pines; [...] "but in all cases," [...] says Mr. Milne, [...] "where oaks were planted {{actually}} among the pines, {{and surrounded by}} them, [though the soil might be inferior,] the oaks {{were found to be}} much the best." [...] "For several years past, the plan pursued has been to plant the inclosures with Scotch pines only, [a tree very similar to our pitch-pine,] and when the pines have got to the height of five or six feet, then to put in good strong oak plants of about four or five years' growth among the pines,--not cutting away any pines at first, unless they happen to be so strong and thick as to overshadow the oaks. In about two years, it becomes necessary to shred the branches of the pines, to give light and air to the oaks, and in about two or three more years to begin gradually to remove the pines altogether, taking out a certain number each year, so that, at the end of twenty or twenty-five years, not a single <b>Scotch</b> <b>pine</b> shall be left; although, for the first ten or twelve years, the plantation may have appeared to contain nothing else but pine. The advantage of this mode of planting {{has been found to be}} that the pines dry and ameliorate the soil, destroying the coarse grass and brambles which frequently choke and injure oaks; and that no mending over is necessary, as scarcely an oak so planted is found to fail." ...|$|E

Worms often remain, as formerly stated, for a long time close to the mouths of their burrows, apparently for warmth; and the basket-like structures formed of leaves would keep their bodies from coming into close contact with the cold damp earth. That they habitually rested on the pine-leaves, was rendered probable by their clean and almost polished surfaces.|$|R

50|$|The {{geographic}} {{location of the}} Christmas tree nursery dictates what species of trees can be propagated. White and <b>Scotch</b> <b>pines</b> are relatively adaptable species of trees. Because many genetically different varieties are available, they can be grown {{in most of the}} temperate areas of the United States. True firs generally prefer a much cooler climate and are primarily grown in the northern United States with some varieties that only thrive in mountainous climates. Spruce prefer cool climates, but they will tolerate warmer conditions than most fir trees. Cypress generally prefer a warmer climate. For this reason, they are grown primarily in the south and southwestern United States. The Douglas fir is a fairly adaptable species and can be grown in much of the United States. In addition to the nursery’s location, the type and location of farms that purchase the seedlings or rooted cuttings also {{plays an important role in}} the type of tree that is propagated.|$|R

All four of the Walks were turfed and this turfing was continued into the areas between the Walks and the Monument within Circle Road.

The entire length of the Avenues were lined with trees, which continued in front of the cottages, with <b>Scotch</b> <b>Pines</b> being used along the North and South Avenues and Lime Trees along East and West Avenues.

40|$|Populations of the {{southern}} Idaho ground squirrel (Spermophilus endemicus; SIDGS), a federally listed candidate species, have declined in the last 30 years mainly because of habitat degredation, loss, and fragmentation. As a management tool, translocation is commonly used to augment, establish, or re-establish wildlife populations, although translocation has historically not been the most successful conservation strategy for species that are threatened or endangered animals {{as a result of}} habitat loss. I employed various techniques to improve translocation success of southern Idaho ground squirrels. To establish new populations, I relocated SIDGS to areas within their native range not already occupied by other individuals of that species. In 2006, I trapped 104 squirrels from the Van Deussen Ranch near Emmett, ID and 212 from the <b>Scotch</b> <b>Pines</b> Golf Course in Payette, ID and translocated them to Little Willow Flat on the Soulen Ranch, approximately 40 km north of Emmett, ID. In 2007, I trapped 170 squirrels from the Van Deussen Ranch and translocated those individuals to another area on the Soulen Ranch, approximately eight km southeast of Midvale, ID. I examined the influence of age, sex, release type, and habitat quality on translocation success. Of the 486 southern Idaho ground squirrels that I trapped and translocated, 112 were fitted with radio collars and monitored for post-release movement and survival. Adult survival to estivation was 45...|$|R

Miss Marlett was one of those people who, fortunately for themselves, and unfortunately for persons dwelling under their roofs, never feel cold, or never know what they feel. Therefore, Miss Marlett never poked the fire, which, consequently used to grow black toward its early death, and was only revived, at dangerously long intervals, by the most minute doses of stimulant in the shape of rather damp small coals.

The Norway spruce, Serbian spruce, <b>Scotch</b> <b>pine,</b> and Turkish fir are not native to the United States.

The Eastern White pine is native to the eastern U.S. The Colorado Blue Spruce is native Colorado and Utah. The White spruce is native to the north-central U.S. and Canada. The Noble, Douglas, and Grand firs are both native to the northwest of the U.S. The Balsam fir is native to the northeastern U.S. [...] The Canaan fir is native to the Canaan Valley of West Virginia. The White fir is native to California and the Southwestern mountains of the U.S. [...] From these varied trees, Christmas tree nurseries must select varieties to propagate based on the climate of their region and the type of farms that they will be selling to.|$|E

50|$|The flora in the {{wildlife}} area of Mongolia is of pasture lands in {{three-fourths of the}} country, which is {{the main source of}} feed for the large stock oia Britannica, Inc. Specifically there are four vegetation zones. Coniferous forest form the taiga region of the northern areas with alpine noted at higher zones. In the mountain forest-steppe zone vegetation is dense on the northern slopes; Siberian larches (grows up to 45 m height), Siberian cedars, interspersed with spruces, <b>pines</b> (Siberian and <b>Scotch</b> <b>pines),</b> and firs along with deciduous vegetation of white and brown birches, aspens, and poplars are noted to dominate the area. The inter-montane basins, wide river valleys and the southern slopes of the mountains have steppe vegetation. Pastureland have a cover of feather grass, couch grass, wormwood, and several species fodder plants. In the semi desert and Gobi desert areas, the vegetation is scanty but just adequate for the camels, sheep and goat populations to feed on and survive. Saxaul (xerophytic) a drought-tolerant species is also noted and it provides for the firewood requirements of the people. Elms and poplars are also found near springs and underground water resources. Saxaul shrubs dominate the deserts and they anchor the sand dunes and prevent erosion. It grows to height of 4 m, over a period of 100 years, with very dense wood which sinks in water. Rhododendrons bloom with red, yellow and white wild flowers and edelweiss is also reported. More than 200 plant species are reported to be under threat.|$|R
