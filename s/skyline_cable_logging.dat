40|$|Gravel-filled traps {{were buried}} in the beds of streams {{draining}} steep logged and unlogged catchments of the Dazzler Range in northern Tasmania, Australia, and removed after storm events, to assess infiltration of fine (less than 1 mm) material into the bed. All stream catchments were geomorphically similar, over similar altitude ranges and had moderately erodible sandy-clay soils on 25 - 35 [o] slopes. Study catchments were selected to control for aspect, logging treatment and coupe age. Fine sediment infiltration into the stream bed was assessed for 15 tributary ephemeral streams in logged areas and 11 streams in unlogged areas. The logged catchments had been clearfelled in three time periods- 1990 - 1991, 1988 - 1989 and 1986 - 1987 -all by <b>skyline</b> <b>cable</b> <b>logging.</b> Trap yield was also assessed in riffles of the perennial valley floor streams upstream and downstream of the junction of six logged and six unlogged tributaries and upstream and downstream of four old but actively used road crossings. Trap yield was significantly higher in logged than unlogged ephemeral streams for size fractions ranging from less than 125 to 500 um, by factors ranging from two to three, but not for sediment between 0. 5 and 1. 0 mm. Trap yield of organic sediment of less than 125 um declined with time after logging and burning, whereas inorganic sediment yield showed no clear trend with couple age. Trap yield of streams logged in 1986 - 1987 was not significantly higher than for control streams, whereas inorganic sediment and 0. 5 - 1. 0 mm organic sediment yields were highest for recently burnt coupes. A significantly greater number of increases in trap yield occurred between riffle pairs of valley floor streams adjacent to junctions of logged tributaries, when compared with control riffle pairs. Logged tributary junctions were associated {{with an increase in}} the organic content of sediment. Road crossings were associated with large increases in infiltration in adjacent riffle pairs, 30 - 50 years after construction. Current forest practices do not protect ephemeral headwater streams from enhanced sediment inputs, the long-term significance of which is unknown.

In a case where necessary logging equipment and machines are available, ground slope {{is the most important}} factor in determining the logging method. For this reason, accurate, up to date, and precise ground slope data is very crucial in the success of forest operations planning. In recent years, high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEM) can be generated for forested areas by using Real Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS method and these DEMs can be used to develop precise slope maps. In this study, high-resolution DEM was developed by RTK-GPS method to generate precise slope map in a sample area.

Static equilibrium and cable length compatibility are used to generate a system of simultaneous equations. This system of coupled, non-linear algebraic equations is solved numerically using the Newton-Raphson algorithm.

The costs of <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> are considerably {{higher than that of}} conventional ground-based methods. Improving cost-effectiveness has been identified as key to ensuring the forestry industry remains cost competitive in the international market. This thesis focuses on ways to better understand and improve <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> methods by specifically focusing on rigging configurations. The investigation was conducted through a comprehensive literature review, an industry survey to establish current use and preferences, a Delphi survey with experts to establish actual advantages and disadvantages, scale model testing to establish some fundamental knowledge of tension to deflection relationship, and finally a series of targeted case studies to establish both productivity and skyline tension in actual operations. Each of these aspects of the research topic employed different methodology. The literature review highlighted the most relevant research relating to <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> world-wide spanning nearly a century. Various research papers, manuals, books and computer software were summarized. While many aspects of cable yarding operations have been investigated, much of it focusing on various aspects of operational efficiency through case studies, there is very limited information with regard to rigging configurations. The survey of 50 <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> practitioners determined what rigging configurations were commonly used in New Zealand. It includes their perceived advantages and disadvantages for varying levels of deflection, but also for specific scenarios such as pulling away from native forest boundaries and flying logs over a stream. Results showed that there were many conflicting perceptions about rigging configuration options. Using an expert panel, a Delphi process was used to derive consensus on what advantages were truly unique to each configuration. This allowed the longer lists of perceived advantages from the industry survey to be pared down to a concise list of ad/disadvantages that will be used in the updating of the Best Practice Guidelines for <b>Cable</b> <b>Logging.</b> To increase our fundamental understanding of tension / payload / deflection relationships, an experiment was conducted in a controlled environment. Using a model yarder in a lab and continuous tension and video recording devices, the dynamic skyline behavior of three similar configurations were tested: North Bend, South Bend and Block in the Bight. The tensions were compared by use of a two-way analysis of variance, which indicated configuration and choker length were significant variables in some but not all of the dynamic load tests. Results also showed that some configurations performed better than others in minimizing the shock loads due to dropping into full suspension, impact with ground objects, and breakout during bridling. Finally, a series of eight studies were conducted on targeted logging operations where relevant stand and terrain parameters were related to the continuous skyline tension monitoring, and recording of productivity through time study. The three targeted configurations included (1) North Bend, (2) Standing skyline using a motorized slack-pulling carriage and (3) a live skyline using a motorized grapple carriage. Results showed that peak and average tensions, as well as amplification factors and the payload to tension relationship, varied between configurations. The study also showed that tensions could be collected to compute measures of payload and tension efficiency, which provided insight into operational performance. The safe working load was exceeded in 53 % of all cycles studied and across seven of eight study sites and 14 of 16 spans. Cycle times were significantly different between rigging configurations and that production information could be used to compute measures of labor and energy consumption as well as payload and tension efficiency; which also provide insight into operational performance. The industry should give serious consideration to the use of tension monitors. Tension monitors have many benefits and have the potential to improve <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> operations in New Zealand. Monitoring tensions can help one learn new techniques or methods (i. e. rigging configurations), help improve payload analysis software for future planning and help evaluate new technology and machinery...|$|R

However, very few new <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> contractors that have started {{over the last}} two decades have been successful in sustaining their operation. The absence of advanced planning, contract management, lack of skilled labor and labor turnover issues has led to inefficient operations that cannot survive financially. A productivity study was carried out on one new Thunderbird TY 45 operation to document the effect of professional training on the production efficiency. The productivity of the operation after a month of self-learning was established at 18. 8 tons per productive machine hour at an average piece size of 1. 25 tons and 120 meter extraction distance. The crew then received one full week of professional training from two experienced Pacific Northwest riggers. Two weeks after the training the average productivity increased to 23. 7 tons per productive machine hour. The main factors were a reduction in carriage out and in times, as well as increased average turn volume. Considerable improvements in line shifts, landing organization and safety were also observed.

This study quantified the equipment productivity of steep slope harvesting in a 33 year-old Pinus radiata D. Don (radiata pine) plantation. Mechanized felling {{was an integral part}} of this operation, although there were areas of motor- manually felled trees due to terrain and stream restrictions. Thus the difference in productivity of the yarder for bunched and unbunched trees was quantified. For an average piece size of 0. 8 m^ 3, a productivity of 138 m^ 3 /PMH was predicted for the feller-buncher. Bunching substantially improved the productivity of the swing yarder. Mean volume per cycle for the swing yarder was 1. 9 m^ 3 for bunched trees versus 1. 3 m^ 3 for unbunched trees. For a yarding distance range between 150 and 240 metres, bunching increased the productivity by 25 %.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of cable-based yarding systems {{has been studied}} extensively, resulting in numerous work productivity models (i. e. models predicting the ratio between output and time). Productivity models are used in both research and operations management, but are laborious to develop.

Therefore, work productivity models developed in recent years were compiled, with the aim of increasing their visibility, accessibility and comparability to potential users and other interested parties. This compilation should facilitate comparisons and evaluations of the models and their influential parameters, and the synthesis of existing models. A systematic review of the international scientific literature on <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> published between 2000 and 2011 was performed.

Thus, it is challenging to find not only economically and environmentally "feasible" solutions but also "good" solutions by the manual method. Tools for detailed analysis and systematic evaluation of alternatives become essential for better planning of harvesting operations. This study develops a methodology with the purpose of assisting the planners in designing <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> unit layout. The methodology combines a <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> operation planning problem with a road network planning problem and optimizes them simultaneously. It incorporates modem computer software languages, Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, and optimization techniques that have become available during the last two decades. The methodology includes logging feasibility and cost analysis to evaluate alternative cable roads and yarding equipment. Once the feasible cable road alternatives are identified, the methodology formulates two cost minimization network problems. The networks represent variable and fixed costs associated with yarding and truck transportation activities to move logs from the stump to the mill. The methodology uses a heuristic network algorithm as an optimization technique to solve the network problems. One of the two cost minimization network problems is for <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> operation planning and the other is for truck transportation planning. Each of the network problems is solved separately using the heuristic network algorithm while being connected to the other by a feedback mechanism. The methodology is implemented in a computerized model that {{can be used as a}} decision support system. The model is applied to an actual harvest area of 93 ha. A total of 40 candidate landing locations with 2, 880 cable roads from 2 yarding equipment alternatives were evaluated. The model found 1, 719 feasible cable road alternatives by conducting the logging feasibility and cost analysis. Two cost minimization network problems were developed. A total of 141, 139 links and 1, 926 timber parcels were developed in the network problem for <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> paths. In the network for solving road location problem, a total of 95, 904 links were developed to connect 13, 522 grid cells included in the planning area. After 47. 2 hours for 10 repetitions on Pentium HI 1 GHz speed desktop computer, the heuristic network algorithm solved these network problems and selected a total of 19 landings and 155 cable roads to harvest 8, 064 m³ of logs from 1, 926 timber parcels over the planning area. A total of 2. 85 kilometers of new access roads were proposed as a part of the solution for this application. Overall yarding and road costs for timber harvest in the planning area was 416, 675 (5 1. 67 /m³). Although the exact solution could not be verified, the solution obtained with this methodology when coupled with sensitivity analysis can be considered as a feasible and good harvest operation plan for the management goals. By providing systematic and analytic tools, the computerized model presented in this study can be used as a decision support tool assisting the forest planners in designing timber harvest layout...|$|R

The program will accept up to 110 road segments. Each segment is analyzed individually based on digitized data from a contour map and user defined road construction parameters. Three types of construction are analyzed for each segment: fullbench and sidecast, fullbench and endhaul and balanced construction. Program results and operation are exemplified {{in an analysis of}} a proposed transportation plan in a <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> study area in New England. The study area is on the Green Mountain National Forest in Central Vermont. The transportation plan contains 99 miles of proposed new road within the 25, 000 acre study area. Cost an...|$|R
40|$|Steel {{wire rope}} {{is used for}} many logging applications. It has served the {{industry}} well in terms of strength, durability, and longevity. However, steel wire rope is difficult to use because it is stiff, heavy, and unyielding. These characteristics can lead to fatigue and exhaustion, and may contribute to worker injuries. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene synthetic rope {{has the potential to}} replace steel wire rope for selected logging applications. Research shows ergonomic gains and other operational effectiveness with its use. This paper presents research results, potentials, and issues in improving economic and ergonomic performance of ground-based and <b>cable</b> <b>logging.</b> Potential social and environmental benefits are also discussed. Further training, research and promotion are necessary to put this new technology into the hands of users and assure adoption in the forestry sector...|$|R
50|$|High lead logging is {{a method}} of <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> using a spar, yarder and loader. It was {{developed}} by Oscar Wirkkala. It is accomplished with two lines (cables) and two winches (or cable drums). The mainline or yarding line extends out from one winch, while a second usually lighter line called the haulback line extends out from the other winch to a 'tail block' or pulley at the tail (back) end of the logging site, and passes through the tail block and connects to the main line. Butt rigging is installed where the two lines join and the logs are hooked to the butt rigging with chokers. The procedure is to wind up the main line and the logs are pulled in, wind up the haulback and the butt rigging is pulled out for more logs or another 'turn'.|$|R
