5|$|Freitas finds {{numerous}} {{reasons why}} interstellar probes {{may be a}} preferred method of communication among extraterrestrial civilizations wishing {{to make contact with}} Earth. A civilization aiming {{to learn more about the}} distribution of life within the galaxy might, he speculates, send probes to a large number of star systems, rather than using radio, as one cannot ensure a response by radio but can (he says) ensure that probes will return to their sender with data on the star systems they survey. Furthermore, probes would enable the surveying of non-intelligent populations, or those not yet capable of <b>space</b> <b>navigation</b> (like humans before the 20th century), as well as intelligent populations that might not wish to provide information about themselves and their planets to extraterrestrial civilizations. In addition, the greater energy required to send living beings rather than a robotic probe would, according to Michaud, be only used for purposes such as a one-way migration.|$|E

At least Moscow had an interplanetary travel group as early as 1924, and three years later, at the time the Germans founded their first rocket society, the Russians were hosts to the first International Exhibition of <b>Space</b> <b>Navigation.</b> In 1928 and during the following four years Professor Nikolai Rynin published a formidable nine-volume encyclopedia entitled Interplanetary Communications.

Finally, a static and dynamic presentation model is constructed. The different models of the design process are represented by using a Web extension of UML. The strength of the presented methodology is that most steps can be performed in a semi-automatic way, thus providing the basis for a systematic mechanism for Web design...|$|R
2500|$|From 1968 to 1969, the {{research}} institutes of the Ministry of Defence, Academy of Sciences, and Soviet Navy cooperated {{to develop a}} single system for navigation of their air, land, sea, and space forces. The requirements of such a system were formulated in a document completed in 1970. Six years later, in December 1976, a plan for developing the system was accepted by the Central Committee of the CPSU and of the Council of Ministers of the USSR in a decree entitled [...] "On Deployment of the Unified <b>Space</b> <b>Navigation</b> System GLONASS." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first satellite-based radio {{navigation}} system developed in the Soviet Union was Tsiklon, which had the purpose of providing ballistic missile submarines a method for accurate positioning. 31 Tsiklon satellites were launched between 1967 and 1978. The main problem with the system was that, although highly accurate for stationary or slow-moving ships, it required several hours of observation by the receiving station to fix a position, making it unusable for many navigation purposes and for {{the guidance of the}} new generation of ballistic missiles. In 1968–1969, a new navigation system, which would support not only the navy, but also the air, land and space forces, was conceived. Formal requirements were completed in 1970; in 1976, the government made a decision to launch development of the [...] "Unified <b>Space</b> <b>Navigation</b> System GLONASS".|$|E

The learned model {{can be seen as a}} building block for a hierarchical control architecture based on the Bayesian Map formalism.
