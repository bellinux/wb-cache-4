5|$|Self-harm (SH), {{also known}} as self-injury, {{is defined as the}} intentional, direct {{injuring}} of body tissue, done without suicidal intentions. These terms are used in the more recent literature in an attempt to reach a more neutral terminology. The older literature, especially that which predates the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), almost exclusively refers to <b>self-mutilation.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{widespread}} use of conscription, the compulsory recruitment of soldiers' sons, the relaxation of age and height requirements and the branding of recruits all {{add up to a}} picture of an army that had severe difficulties in finding, and retaining, sufficient recruits. Recruitment difficulties are confirmed in the legal code evidence: there are measures to deal with cases of <b>self-mutilation</b> to avoid military service (such as cutting off a thumb), including an extreme decree of 386 requiring such persons to be burnt alive. Desertion was clearly a serious problem, and was probably much worse than in the army of the Principate, since the latter was mainly a volunteer army. This is supported {{by the fact that the}} granting of leave of absence (commeatus) was more strictly regulated. While in the 2nd century, a soldier's leave was granted at the discretion of his regimental commander, in the 4th century, leave could only be granted by a far senior officer (dux, comes or magister militum). In addition, it appears that comitatus units were typically one-third understrength. The massive disparity between official and actual strength is powerful evidence of recruitment problems. Against this, Elton argues that the late army did not have serious recruitment problems, on the basis of the large numbers of exemptions from conscription that were granted.|$|E

40|$|Assumptions and aims: In {{recent years}} we have been observing an {{increasing}} number of adolescent patients exhibiting autoaggressive behaviour. These are often direct <b>self-mutilations,</b> defined as deliberate body injuries. The intention of such behaviours is physical self-injuring to reduce mental pain, relieve emotional tension and anxiety. This is accompanied by the sense of being “rewarded”. The study is aimed at analysing the correlation between the severity of general hostility and its respective subscales assessed by the Buss-Durkee Inventory on Moods and humours and the occurrence of selfmutilations in a group of adolescents with superficial <b>self-mutilations.</b> Material and methods: The examined population consisted of 67 persons aged 14 - 18 years, of both genders. Qualified to the examined group were 42 adolescent patients exhibiting autoaggressive behaviour. The control group consisted of 25 persons selected according to age and gender who did not exhibit such behaviours. Excluded from the study were subjects with depressive, psychotic disorders as well as significant somatic disorders, and those who used psychotropic drugs and psychoactive substances. The respondents completed the Buss-Durkee Inventory assessing the level of general hostility and its seven subscales: direct aggressiveness consisting of physical and verbal aggressiveness, indirect aggressiveness, resentment, negativism, suspiciousness and irritability. A separate scale assessed the sense of guilt. Conclusions: 1) <b>Self-mutilations</b> in the examined group were associated with severity of aggressiveness directed outwards (measured both by its general level and in respective subscales). 2) Self-mutilating patients require therapeutic measures (psychotherapeutic and pharmacological) aimed at reduction not only of autoaggression but also aggression directed outwards...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to monitoring activation and avoidance responses, clinicians carefully observe the individual's strengths or difficulties with affect regulation (i.e., affect tolerance and affect modulation). Such difficulties may be evidenced by mood swings, brief yet intense depressive episodes, or <b>self-mutilation.</b> The information gathered through observation of affect regulation will guide the clinician's decisions regarding the individual's readiness to partake in various therapeutic activities.|$|E

40|$|<b>Self-mutilations</b> of the {{external}} genitals in psychiatric patients also known as Klingsor syndrome is a rare urologic trauma. Men with religious conflicts, low self-esteem, unresolved transsexual issues and feelings of guilt are the most vulnerable. This condition requires immediate surgical intervention. Currently replantation involves meticulous microsurgery and has become the primary method for managing these patients. In this paper, we report a case of self amputation of penis in a patient with a psychiatric history significant for schizopfrenia. Because of the unavailability of a microscope in our department, a non-microsurgical replantation without microscopic magnification was attempted. After surgery, normal appearance and function including a good normal voiding, sensation, and erections were observed...|$|R
5000|$|Among {{the great}} {{collection}} of personalities portrayed, we can highlight, among others, those dedicated to musicians and singers.

It's also {{important to point out}} the photographs taken, mostly in the seventies, {{of the members of the}} Barcelona [...] "Gauche Divine" [...] movement. In addition to the portraits, Colita's collection also contains a series of journalistic photographs covering the social movements of the time. For example, the sit-in at Montserrat, the attack against the Enlace bookstore, the <b>self-mutilations</b> of the COPEL (Spanish inmates group), Catalonia's National Day of September 11, 1978, the ceremony and acts arounds Franco's death in Madrid, the burial of the President of the Generalitat de Catalunya, Josep Tarrardellas, and various events of the Socialist Party of Catalonia that took place during the eighties.|$|R
25|$|LNS is {{characterized}} by three major hallmarks: neurologic dysfunction, cognitive and behavioral disturbances including <b>self-mutilation,</b> and uric acid overproduction (hyperuricemia). Damage to the basal ganglia causes sufferers to adopt a characteristic fencing stance {{due to the nature}} of the lesion. Some may also be afflicted with macrocytic anemia. Virtually all patients are male; males suffer delayed growth and puberty, and most develop shrunken testicles or testicular atrophy. Female carriers are at an increased risk for gouty arthritis but are usually otherwise unaffected.|$|E

40|$|Rebels and Robbers {{is about}} the {{political}} economy of violence in post-colonial Angola. This book provides the first comprehensive attempt at analyzing how the military and non-military dynamics of more than four decades of conflict created the structural violence that stubbornly defines Angolan society {{even in the absence of}} war. The book clearly demonstrates that the end of the civil war has not ushered in positive peace. The focus on structural violence enables the author to explore the continuities since colonial times, especially in the ways race, class, ethnicity, and power have been used by governing elites as mechanisms to oppress the powerless. Thus, although corruption as structural violence manifesting itself so ubiquitously in Angola today may have been taken to new levels after independence, its origin is unmistakably colonial. Similarly, the zero-sum character of political interactions that defined colonial Angola is yet to be fully exorcized. But there are also important discontinuities. The unabashed propensity to capture public resources for personal aggrandizement is purely post-colonial. So is the tendency toward personal, unaccountable rule. Given its rich endowments, the end of the civil war provides Angola with an opportunity to finally realize its developmental potential. This will depend on whether the wealth resulting from the exploration of natural resources is directed toward creating the conditions for the citizens' realization of their aspirations for the good life thus ensuring sustainable peace.

25|$|The popularity, longevity, and {{intelligence}} {{of many of}} the larger kinds of pet parrots and their wild traits such as screaming, has led to many birds needing to be rehomed during the course of their long lifespans. A common problem is that large parrots that are cuddly and gentle as juveniles mature into intelligent, complex, often demanding adults who can outlive their owners, and can also become aggressive or even dangerous. Due to an increasing number of homeless parrots, they are being euthanised like dogs and cats, and parrot adoption centres and sanctuaries are becoming more common. Parrots do not often do well in captivity, causing some parrots to go insane and develop repetitive behaviours, such as swaying and screaming, or they become riddled with intense fear. Feather destruction and <b>self-mutilation,</b> although not commonly seen in the wild, occur frequently in captivity.|$|E
25|$|In March 1985, {{after his}} arrest but before his trial, DuMond claimed he was {{attacked}} in his home by two men and castrated. No arrests {{were made in the}} incident. Phil Ostermann, the Arkansas State Police investigator who handled the castration case, noted in his report that Dr. Jeff Whitfield of the Elvis Presley Trauma Center in Memphis examined DuMond after the incident, and was asked by DuMond's wife whether it was possible the castration was self-inflicted. Whitfield responded that it was possible, and he had noted similar cases of <b>self-mutilation</b> in the past. Fletcher Long, the attorney who prosecuted DuMond for the rape of Ashley Stevens, was skeptical that DuMond could have castrated himself, but he also doubted DuMond's account because {{there was no evidence of}} a struggle, or that he had been tied up (which should have left ligature marks), and there was a two-thirds-empty half-gallon bottle of Jim Beam whiskey at the scene of the supposed assault.|$|E
25|$|There has {{previously}} been no effective method of treatment for the neurobehavioral aspects of the disease. Even children treated from birth with allopurinol develop behavioral and neurologic problems, despite never having had high serum concentrations of uric acid. Self-injurious and other behaviors are best managed {{by a combination of}} medical, physical, and behavioral interventions. The <b>self-mutilation</b> is often reduced by using restraints. Sixty percent of individuals have their teeth extracted in order to avoid self-injury, which families have found to be an effective management technique. Because stress increases self-injury, behavioral management through aversive techniques (which would normally reduce self-injury) actually increases self-injury in individuals with LNS. Nearly all affected individuals need restraints to prevent self-injury, and are restrained more than 75% of the time. This is often at their own request, and occasionally involves restraints that would appear to be ineffective, as they do not physically prevent biting. Families report that affected individuals are more at ease when restrained.|$|E
25|$|At one {{veterinary}} teaching hospital, between 50 and 80% of cats {{had one or}} more medical complications post-surgery; 19.8% developed complications after release.

500|$|Favazza and Rosenthal (1993) {{reviewed}} {{hundreds of}} studies and divided <b>self-mutilation</b> into two categories: culturally sanctioned <b>self-mutilation</b> and deviant <b>self-mutilation.</b> Favazza also created two subcategories of sanctioned self-mutilations; rituals and practices. The rituals are mutilations repeated generationally and [...] "reflect the traditions, symbolism, {{and beliefs of}} a society" [...] (p.226). Practices are historically transient and cosmetic such as piercing of earlobes, nose, eyebrows as well as male circumcision (for non-Jews) while Deviant <b>self-mutilation</b> is equivalent to self-harm.|$|E

500|$|... "Today" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{alternative}} {{rock band}} The Smashing Pumpkins, written by lead vocalist and guitarist Billy Corgan. The song, though seemingly upbeat, contains dark lyrics. Corgan wrote the song about a day {{in which he was}} having suicidal thoughts, exemplified by the reference to <b>self-mutilation</b> in the chorus. The contrast between the grim subject matter of the song and the soft instrumental part during the verses, coupled with use of irony in the lyrics, left many listeners unaware of the song's tale of depression and desperation. The song alternates between quiet, dreamy verses and loud choruses with layered, distorted guitar.|$|E

500|$|Self-harm (SH), also {{referred}} to as self-injury (SI), self-inflicted violence (SIV), nonsuicidal self injury (NSSI) or self-injurious behaviour (SIB), refers to a spectrum of behaviours where demonstrable injury is self-inflicted. The behaviour involves deliberate tissue damage that is usually performed without suicidal intent. [...] The most common form of self-harm involves cutting of the skin using a sharp object, e. g. a knife or razor blade. The term <b>self-mutilation</b> is also sometimes used, although this phrase evokes connotations that some find worrisome, inaccurate, or offensive. Self-inflicted wounds is a specific term associated with soldiers to describe non-lethal injuries inflicted in order to obtain early dismissal from combat. This differs from the common definition of self-harm, as damage is inflicted for a specific secondary purpose. A broader definition of self-harm might also include those who inflict harm on their bodies by means of disordered eating.|$|E

[...] He would tolerate some criticism of the party by its members, but when he believed that it rose to <b>self-mutilation,</b> he suppressed it ruthlessly. [...] This was most apparent when Lewis attacked and discredited Frank Underhill and his handling of Woodsworth House. [...] Early in Lewis' career, Underhill was one of his mentors; this did not matter when Woodsworth House was stricken with financial difficulties in the late 1940s. Lewis was quick to blame and then discharged Underhill {{and the rest of the}} Woodsworth executive of their responsibilities. It was an unfortunate event that cost the CCF in the academic and intelligentsia world. To sum up Lewis' reign, discipline and solidarity were paramount.
