50|$|These {{systems are}} all remote {{controlled}} gyroscopic assisted stabilizing platforms. They utilize {{a series of}} <b>spinning</b> <b>fly</b> wheels and electronics to dampen the angular disturbances. They are mostly used for helicopter work but {{can also be used}} for camera car, crane, or suspended cable systems. The A-1 systems do not have steerability of the roll (dutch) axis, only horizon leveling. These systems as well as the (A), will eliminate almost all of the angular disturbances. The drawback is that the (A-1) systems are closed architecture systems. The DP can only utilize the offered one or two cameras and lens combinations, normally a Mitchell R35 camera and a 10:1 zoom lens.|$|E

Flight trials revealed a marked sensitivity to turbulence resulting in flutter, and during trials at stalling speed, the SZD-20X entered a spin, which the rudders were unable to recover the aircraft from, only when the pilot shifted his weight as far forward as he could, did the SZD-20X recover from the <b>spin.</b> <b>Flying</b> in the SZD-20X continued until 6 October 1959, when turbulence-induced flutter tore the aircraft apart, the pilot escaping with parachute.|$|R

5000|$|Shad {{are also}} valued as a sport fish that exhibit complex and little-understood feeding {{behavior}} while spawning. Unlike salmon, shad retain {{the ability to}} digest and assimilate food during the anadromous migration. Like other fish, their feeding instinct can be triggered {{by a variety of}} factors such as turbidity and water temperature. Anglers use both <b>spinning</b> and <b>fly</b> fishing tackle to pursue shad. Spin fisherman use a shad dartjig or a flutter spoon. Some anglers use a downrigger to place the artificial lure at the desired depth and location. This is usually in the channel, or deepest part of the river. Migrating shad tend to occupy the lower portion of the water column which makes this the typical depth of choice for fishing. In the North, April through June is when shad spawn in coastal rivers and estuaries once water temperatures have reached 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14 °C). Fishing conditions typically improve as water temperatures warm and flow decreases.|$|R
5000|$|The pre-positioning of this {{ordnance}} was {{the basis}} for one of the [...] "worst disasters in Air Force history". On 16 May 1965, while waiting to takeoff on a mission, a B-57B exploded on the ground at Bien Hoa AB. The B-57 was started with a black powder cartridge that fired when the pilot hit the starter switch, causing a small starter turbine to spin. These turbines sometimes <b>spun</b> loose and <b>flew</b> out of the starter housing. On this day, a loose turbine hit the fuse of an armed 500 lb bomb, setting off a whole chain of secondary explosions.|$|R
40|$|Mutations in {{the spin}} gene are {{characterized}} by an extraordinarily strong rejection behavior of female flies in response to male courtship. They are also accompanied by decreases in the viability, adult life span, and oviposition rate of the <b>flies.</b> In <b>spin</b> mutants, some oocytes and adult neural cells undergo degeneration, which is preceded by reductions in programmed cell death of nurse cells in ovaries and of neurons in the pupal nervous system, respectively. The central nervous system (CNS) of <b>spin</b> mutant <b>flies</b> accumulates autofluorescent lipopigments with characteristics {{similar to those of}} lipofuscin. The spin locus generates at least five different transcripts, with only two of these being able to rescue the spin behavioral phenotype; each encodes a protein with multiple membrane-spanning domains that are expressed in both the surface glial cells in the CNS and the follicle cells in the ovaries. Orthologs of the spin gene have also been identified in a number of species from nematodes to humans. Analysis of the spin mutant will give us new insights into neurodegenerative diseases and aging...|$|R
6000|$|This is a {{favourite}} {{device of}} sea trout, {{which are very}} apt to 'flasker' {{on the top of}} the water. The Vade Mecum, in advance of Walton on this point, recommends a swivel in minnow-fishing: but has no idea of an artificial minnow of silk. I have known an ingenious lady who, when the bodies of her phantom minnows gave out, in Norway, supplied their place successfully with bed-quilting artfully sewn. In fact, anything bright and spinning will allure fish, though in the upper Ettrick, where large trout exist, they will take the natural, but perhaps never the phantom or angel minnow. I once tried a <b>spinning</b> Alexandra <b>fly</b> over some large pond trout. They followed it eagerly, but never took hold, on the first day; afterwards they would not look at it at all. The Vade Mecum man, like Dr. Hamilton, recommends a light fly for a light day, a dark fly for a dark day and dark weather; others hold the converse opinion. Every one agrees that the smallness of the flies should be in proportion to the lowness of the water and the advance of summer. {7} ...|$|R

25|$|Traditionally rods {{are made}} from bamboo, while {{contemporary}} rods are usually made from fibreglass or carbon fibre.

Various types of fishing rods are designed for specific types of fishing. Fly rods are used to cast artificial <b>flies,</b> <b>spinning</b> rods and bait casting rods are designed to cast baits or lures. Ice fishing rods are designed to fish through small holes in ice covered lakes. Trolling rods are designed to drag bait or lures behind moving boats.|$|R
