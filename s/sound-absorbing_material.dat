Therefore, {{the development of}} this research has important and necessary significance for solving the problem of noise pollution. Combined with the above review, it can be found that the conductive phase/piezoelectric phase/elastomer piezoelectric damping sound absorbing composite material is a new technology, which is very promising because of its high internal friction, high damping and sound absorption coefficient, and excellent comprehensive performance. But there are still some problems. First, the overall performance of the damping sound absorption coefficient needs to be further improved. Second, due to the large number of phases and long preparation process, the influence of the relative composite properties is not clear.

40|$|<b>Sound-absorbing</b> <b>materials</b> absorb most of {{the sound}} energy {{striking}} them, making them very useful for the control of noise. They are used {{in a variety of}} locations – close to sources of noise, in various paths, and sometimes close to receivers. Although all materials absorb some incident sound, the term “acoustical ma-terial ” has been primarily applied to those materials that have been produced for the specific purpose of providing high values of absorption. The major uses of absorbing materials are almost invariably found to include the reduction of reverberant sound pressure levels and, consequently, the reduction of the reverbera-tion time in enclosures, or rooms.

30|$|The {{acoustic}} {{properties of}} board material are well defined and are gauged {{in terms of}} absorption, reflection, impedance, admittance, and transmission loss. <b>Sound-absorbing</b> <b>materials</b> are those materials designed and used for absorbing sound {{that might otherwise be}} reflected. Sound is absorbed when part of the energy striking a surface or an object is converted into heat energy in the pores of the material. Therefore, sound absorption is described as heat conversion of energy. The sound-absorbing characteristics of acoustical materials vary significantly with frequency. For the vast majority of conventional acoustical materials, material thickness has the greatest influence on the <b>material’s</b> <b>sound-absorbing</b> qualities. The absorption coefficient also varies with the frequency and angle of incidence of the sound. Generally, higher frequencies are more easily absorbed than the low frequencies. Materials that are good absorbers allow sound to pass through them relatively easily. <b>Sound-absorbing</b> <b>materials</b> commonly used in construction include porous materials such as glass wool, gypsum, and similar materials.|$|R

The cavity is a rectangular box with five rigid walls and one flexible wall which is an aluminium plate. The porous <b>sound-absorbing</b> <b>material</b> {{is attached to the}} inner surface of the plate, in order to modify the coupling between the plate inner surface and the air inside the box. The plate is mechanically excited by using an electromagnetic shaker, which is imitating structure-borne noise. The generated noise is recorded by using pressure microphones at the different locations inside the box. The results show that there is good agreement between the FEM prediction and the measurement for the acoustic response at different locations inside the rectangular box. Sound pressure peaks due to cavity modes are effectively reduced by adding porous <b>sound-absorbing</b> <b>material.</b> Furthermore, sound level in the cavity is reduced by a similar amount in both the numerical simulation and the measurement, when a porous <b>sound-absorbing</b> <b>material</b> is added.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{in order}} to reduce the {{external}} radiation of food refrigeration compressor’s noise, the main noise frequency analysis based on the theoretical calculation and practical experiment is carried out and the acoustic enclosure design is conducted. Conventional <b>sound-absorbing</b> <b>material</b> adopts rock wool and glass wool which have poor environmental protection. In the design process the environmental friendly melamine cotton is chosen as the <b>sound-absorbing</b> <b>material</b> that has not ever been massively adopted. What’s more, with a consideration of ventilation and heat dissipation, acoustic enclosure interior is designed with muffler air duct and the low-speed and low-noise fan. Therefore, both the normal operation of the compressor and the sound insulation of the acoustic enclosure are ensured in this way. Then with the sound level meter the noise A-weighted SPLs of the compressor with and without the enclosure are measured and are compared with each other. The results show that after covering the acoustic enclosure the compressor’s noise is less than 60 dB, which meets the design requirements of noise control. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that the sound insulation of the acoustic enclosure reaches the design standards and the acoustic enclosure design is feasible...|$|E

30|$|At present, {{the design}} of the sound {{absorption}} properties of the polymer mainly focuses on the structural design of the polymer chain: such as the soft segment and hard segment ratio of the molecular chain, the molecular chain configuration, and the winding mode. The main purpose is to enhance the damping properties and intrinsic sound absorption properties of polymer materials. Then, by modifying in a polymer material, such as adding a bubble filler or other foaming process, the polymer material has a certain amount of microcavities, and the sound absorption performance of the material is improved by friction [6]. The rubber used to make the <b>sound-absorbing</b> <b>material</b> is styrene butadiene rubber, neoprene rubber, natural rubber, polyurethane, and the like. Because of the poor damping properties (energy conversion properties) of these rubbers, they rely mainly on the cavity to attenuate the acoustic signal, while the material itself contributes less to the attenuation of the underwater acoustic signal. Therefore, this material is particularly suitable for underwater acoustic absorption materials, and it has the advantages of light weight and easy molding compared with the material added with metal powder. The shortcoming is that the performance of the universal <b>sound-absorbing</b> <b>material</b> in the air is not high, and the elastomer rubber has disadvantages such as poor flame retardancy and aging due to its own problems [7].|$|E
