5|$|Behind the <b>sea</b> <b>wall,</b> {{the marshes}} were drained after the war, and reverted to farmland, but {{the bank was}} {{breached}} in the North Sea flood of 1953, returning the whole area to tidal saltmarsh dominated by sea aster. The {{construction of a new}} <b>sea</b> <b>wall</b> across the reserve created a shallow freshwater lagoon, with a reed bed on its northern side and a vegetation-free brackish marsh.|$|E
5|$|Between 1915 and 1919, work {{proceeded}} at Apollo Bundar (Port) {{to reclaim}} the land on which the gateway and the new <b>sea</b> <b>wall</b> would be built. The foundations were completed in 1920 and construction was finished in 1924. The gateway was opened on December 4, 1924 by the Viceroy, the Earl of Reading.|$|E
5|$|Burnham {{was seriously}} {{affected}} by the Bristol Channel floods of 1607, and various flood defences have been installed since then. In 1911, a concrete <b>sea</b> <b>wall</b> was built, and after World War II further additions to the defences were made using {{the remains of a}} Mulberry harbour.|$|E

5|$|Crossing {{the river}} by ferry or the long Shaldon Bridge brings walkers to Teignmouth, beyond which the coast path follows the South Devon Railway <b>sea</b> <b>wall</b> to Hole Head where the Parson and Clerk rocks look out to sea. Passing beneath the railway, the path climbs {{up to the}} main road, which it follows for a few yards before turning back towards the cliff top (in stormy weather the <b>sea</b> <b>wall</b> is too {{dangerous}} and this road must be followed {{most of the way}} from Teignmouth). Entering Dawlish along a now by-passed toll road, the coast path descends back {{to the level of the}} railway which it follows to Dawlish Warren, although a slightly more landward route is necessary at high tides.|$|E
5|$|Some other notable {{structures}} were added when smaller companies were amalgamated into the GWR. These include the South Devon Railway <b>sea</b> <b>wall,</b> the Cornwall Railway's Royal Albert Bridge, and Barmouth Bridge on the Cambrian Railways.|$|E

50|$|A seawall {{works by}} {{reflecting}} incident wave energy {{back into the}} sea, thus reducing the energy available to cause erosion. <b>Sea</b> <b>walls</b> have two specific weaknesses. First, wave reflection from the wall may result in scour and subsequent lowering of the sand level of the fronting beach. Second, <b>sea</b> <b>walls</b> may accelerate erosion of adjacent, unprotected coastal areas because they affect the littoral drift process.|$|R
5|$|Across Micronesia, {{impact from}} the typhoon was fairly limited. Winds on Nukuoro were {{estimated}} at 45–75km/h (30–45mph), resulting in minor {{damage to buildings}} and crops. Losses on the atoll reached $10,000. Lukunor, located farther west, experienced similar winds; however, damage was slightly more severe. Notable coastal impact took place, with portions of the dock and <b>sea</b> <b>wall</b> damaged. Damage across Lukunor and nearby islands amounted to $20,000.|$|E
5|$|At Sparrow's {{execution}} in Port Royal, Will saves Sparrow, {{but they are}} quickly captured. Elizabeth intervenes, declaring her love for Will who is pardoned, while Sparrow escapes by tumbling off a <b>sea</b> <b>wall.</b> The Black Pearl and her new crew arrive in time to retrieve him, and he becomes captain once more. Impressed by the wily pirate, Norrington allows him one day's head start before giving chase.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its close}} {{proximity}} to the sea, Jaywick had never been a practical place for farming due to the risk from floods; and the land remained unused. A <b>sea</b> <b>wall</b> was built in 1880 to protect against flooding. Ordnance Survey mapping around 1897 shows Jaywick as a few farmhouses near what is now Crossways on the Tudor estate.|$|E

5|$|Removal {{of mines}} and {{obstacles}} from the beach, {{a job that}} had to be performed quickly before the tide came in at 10:30, was the assignment of 237th and 299th Combat Engineer Battalions and the eight dozer tanks. The teams used explosives to destroy beach obstacles and blow gaps in the <b>sea</b> <b>wall</b> to allow quicker access for troops and vehicles. The dozer tanks pushed the wreckage out of the way to create clear lanes for further landings.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, {{the castle}} was {{suffering}} badly {{from the effects}} of coastal erosion but remained in military use until 1863. The War Office then demolished the upper levels with explosives, carrying out a second wave of demolition work in 1882 and destroying most of the surviving stonework in 1893. The remains of Sandown were purchased by the town of Deal for £35 to form part of the local sea defences. The remaining masonry was encased in concrete in the late 1980s to form a <b>sea</b> <b>wall</b> but remains vulnerable to further erosion by the sea.|$|E
5|$|In Fakaofo, {{the storm}} surge from Percy damaged a <b>sea</b> <b>wall</b> and caused major beach erosion. One house was {{destroyed}} while others were severely damaged. Percy also damaged much of the coconut harvest and 50% of the livestock {{were killed by the}} cyclone. Atafu also suffered similar damage as the storm damaged a UHF tower and several storage sheds. Damage to crops was also significant as the storm damaged much of the banana and pandanus harvests. The schools in Atafu suffered only minimal damage (mostly wind damage).|$|E

50|$|On 27 September 2011, the <b>sea</b> <b>walls</b> of Manila Bay were {{destroyed}} by the storm surge caused by Typhoon Pedring. Even the United States Embassy, Museo Pambata and Sofitel Philippine Plaza were submerged by the flooding. It was estimated that the damage would cost P30 million to repair. On April 2012, the <b>sea</b> <b>walls</b> were once again opened to the public, having been redesigned to withstand a strong storm surge.|$|R

5|$|Strong waves caused {{extensive}} {{damage to the}} coastline, especially on the southern portion of Bermuda. The strong waves broke a boat from its moorings at Spanish Point. Not wanting to lose the ship, the owner, accompanied with two people, tried to save the vessel. One fell overboard before climbing aboard the boat. The three ventured the vessel through tornadoes and 20-foot (6m) waves, which dropped several feet {{of water in the}} ship; however, ultimately they safely arrived at Hamilton Harbour. Five charter boats capsized from the waves, while several others crashed against reefs. Strong waves collapsed a <b>sea</b> <b>wall</b> in Hamilton, causing traffic jams for one day until it was fixed.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Cuba, Hurricane Georges {{produced}} torrential rainfall, peaking at 24.41inches (620mm) in Limonar in {{the province}} of Guantánamo. Several other locations reported over a foot (300mm) of precipitation as well. Storm surge of 4–6feet (1–2m) was expected along the eastern coastline, along with dangerous waves on top of the surge. Though winds were reduced by the time Georges hit Cuba, it still retained winds of 75mph (120km/h), along with stronger gusts in squalls. Waves exceeding 16ft (4.8m) impacted coastal regions of the county, with some areas reporting that waves were topping the <b>sea</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two earlier {{business}} decisions by the Chicago Sun-Times led to substantial savings {{of time and}} money during the Trump Tower's construction. The original 1950s <b>sea</b> <b>wall</b> was built by the newspaper company to bomb-shelter thickness, to withstand a Cold War attack, and thus {{did not have to be}} broken down and rebuilt. Furthermore, the company decided in the 1970s to switch from petroleum-based to soy-based ink, which reduced ground pollution from the printing plant. This considerably reduced the costs and time for cleaning up the site prior to building anew.|$|E

5|$|Westgate-on-Sea {{is located}} in {{northeast}} Kent, {{on the coast of}} the Thames Estuary. It is bordered by the town of Margate to the east and the village of Birchington-on-Sea to the west. The town is built beside the two sandy bays of St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, which both have a <b>sea</b> <b>wall</b> and groynes to prevent coastal flooding. Chalk cliffs are present in between the bays and either side of the bays. The whole of the northeast Kent coast has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E
5|$|A mill {{was built}} on Welhay stream but this was {{replaced}} by tidal mills. In the 17th century the City of Bristol bought the manors of North Weston and Portishead {{for access to the}} channel and as a place to stay outside of the city and, in the 19th century, as a seaside resort. An outer <b>sea</b> <b>wall</b> was built allowing the local marshes to be drained and increased the land available for farming. The dominant architecture is early Victorian, with some buildings maintaining their original features. The expansion in residential property coincided with the construction of the dock, pier and the rail link to Bristol. The Royal Hotel by the pier was built in a Tudor Gothic style in 1830, to provide accommodation and catering for travellers on the steamers from Bristol, Wales and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath's {{prospects}} originally {{revolved around}} the harbour. The original harbour was constructed and maintained by the abbot within the terms of an agreement between the burgesses and John Gedy, the abbot in 1394 AD. This {{gave way to a}} more commodious port in 1725, which in turn was enlarged and improved in 1839, when the <b>sea</b> <b>wall,</b> quay walls and breakwater were added to the old inner harbour, at a cost of £58,000. Arbroath became a major port for the coastal shipping trade and in 1846, there were 89 Arbroath registered vessels, totalling 9,100 gross tons. In the same year, 599 vessels docked at Arbroath, 56 from foreign ports (mainly Baltic ports) with the remaining 543 employed on the coastal trade. Bark, flax, hemp, hides, oak and fir timber, and guano for manure, groceries from London, and numerous articles of Baltic produce were imported via Arbroath, with manufactured goods (mainly sailcloth) exported via Arbroath.|$|E
