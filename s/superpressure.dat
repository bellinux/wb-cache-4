2500|$|The balloon {{envelopes}} used in {{the project}} are made by Raven Aerostar, and are composed of polyethylene plastic about [...] thick. The balloons are <b>superpressure</b> balloons filled with helium, standing [...] across and [...] tall when fully inflated. They carry a custom air pump system dubbed the [...] "Croce" [...] that pumps in or releases air to ballast the balloon and control its elevation. A small box weighing [...] containing each balloon's electronic equipment hangs underneath the inflated envelope. This box contains circuit boards that control the system, radio antennas and a Ubiquiti Networks 'Rocket M2' to communicate with other balloons and with Internet antennas on the ground, and batteries to store solar power so the balloons can operate during the night. Each balloon's electronics are powered by an array of solar panels that sit between the envelope and the hardware. In full sun, the panels produce 100 watts of power, which is sufficient to keep the unit running while also charging a battery for use at night. A parachute attached {{to the top of}} the envelope allows for a controlled descent and landing when a balloon is ready to be taken out of service. In the case of an unexpected failure, the parachute deploys automatically. When taken out of service, the balloon is guided to an easily reached location, and the helium is vented into the atmosphere. The balloons typically have a maximum life of about 100 days, although Google claims that its tweaked design can enable them to stay aloft for closer to 200 days.|$|E
50|$|A {{different}} approach for high altitude ballooning, especially used for long duration flights is the <b>superpressure</b> balloon. A <b>superpressure</b> balloon maintains a higher pressure inside the balloon than the external (ambient) pressure.|$|E
50|$|A <b>superpressure</b> balloon, in contrast, has a {{tough and}} inelastic {{envelope}} that {{is filled with}} light gas to pressure {{higher than that of}} the external atmosphere, and then sealed. The <b>superpressure</b> balloon cannot change size greatly, and so maintains a generally constant volume. The <b>superpressure</b> balloon maintains an altitude of constant density in the atmosphere, and can maintain flight until gas leakage gradually brings it down.|$|E
40|$|FIGURE 2. -Based on the 12 {{rawinsonde}} {{stations in}} figure 1, the average variability in rawinsonde ascent rate for cases of “no turbulence ” and various categories of turbulence. Inasmuch as these preliminary {{results suggest that}} an in-being observational system may give some clue as to the occurrence of clear air turbulence, I would concur with Dr. Hodge that further studies along this line appear justified. However, these same results suggest that even more useful information could be obtained from a horizontal sounding system. For example, a <b>superpressured,</b> constant-volume balloon with a high drag coefficient would more clearly delineate the vertical air motions involved, and would possess the additional advantage of remaining within the turbulent area for a considerable time. Although {{there is no doubt}} that there are difficulties involved in precise radar positioning of such balloons for long time intervals, the constant-volume balloon still seems a logical probe for research into the mechanism of clear air turbulence...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{structures}} and airflows of upslope circulations over mountain slopes were measured with temperature sondes on dualtheodolite tracked pilot and mylar <b>superpressured</b> balloons. Measurements were {{made during the}} development period of morning hours and the quasi-stationary period of early afternoon. Upslope flows began shortly after sunrise, and quickly became deeper and stronger. By late morning, the flow field was fully established in a deep layer of a neutral atmosphere. The potential temperature fields in vertical cross sections perpendicular to the slopes were analyzed. Data were {{used to calculate the}} solenoidal energies during periods of afternoon quasistationarity, up to heights of 800 meters above the bases of the slopes. The kinetic energies and the vertical fluxes of horizontal momentum computed for the flows over the same slopes for the same periods determined that the upward vertical fluxes reached a maximum a few hundred meters above the slope and decreased at higher elevations. The levels of upward flux divergence of horizontal momentum coincided with the levels of maximum solenoidal energy...|$|R
50|$|<b>Superpressure</b> {{balloons}} offer flight endurance of months, {{rather than}} days. In fact, in typical operation an Earth-based <b>superpressure</b> balloon mission is ended by a command from ground control {{to open the}} envelope, rather than by natural leakage of gas.|$|E
50|$|Google's Project Loon uses <b>superpressure</b> {{balloons}} {{to achieve}} flights of over 100 days.|$|E
5000|$|A sky anchor is {{a system}} of two {{balloons}} in tandem, with a [...] "zero-pressure" [...] lifting gas balloon tethered to a <b>superpressure</b> balloon [...] "anchor". The gas balloon is filled with a lifting gas and provides the buoyancy, while the <b>superpressure</b> balloon is filled with air, and pressurized to provide the desired ballast weight. In a passive sky anchor, the <b>superpressure</b> balloon is sealed, while in an active system, its pressure can be varied. Both versions have been tested in flight, but have had frequent failures with only occasional successful outcomes. The tandem arrangement makes launching difficult, and this complexity can lead to mission failure.|$|E
50|$|Zylon {{is used by}} NASA in long-duration, high-altitude data collection. Braided Zylon strands {{maintain}} the structure of polyethylene <b>superpressure</b> balloons. Zylon is the material of choice due to its low weight, high tensile strength, and thermal properties.|$|E
5000|$|The GHOST design {{explored}} the performance a <b>superpressure</b> balloon with a spherical two-layer PET film envelope holding the gas inside {{at a higher}} pressure than the surrounding atmosphere, allowing it to maintain a nearly constant altitude. These gas balloons float at a constant density altitude, where the balloon displaces a mass of air equal to its own mass. Expansion of the lifting gas due to solar heating, as in a zero-pressure balloon, is avoided in a <b>superpressure</b> balloon. The inextensible PET film allows the pressure to rise as the gas is heated, rather than allow the volume to expand. This allows them to drift with, and track, horizontal atmospheric air currents at a constant air pressure level (a constant altitude) above the Earth's surface.|$|E
50|$|The {{balloons}} were spherical <b>superpressure</b> types with {{a diameter}} of 3.54 metres (11.6 ft) and filled with helium. A gondola assembly weighing 6.9 kilograms (15.2 pounds) and 1.3 meters (4.26 ft) long {{was connected to the}} balloon envelope by a tether 13 metres (42.6 ft) long. Total mass of the entire assembly was 21 kilograms (46 pounds).|$|E
50|$|Up to August 1978, ten {{subsequent}} transatlantic balloon crossing {{attempts were}} made: In February 1974, while making one such attempt, Colonel Thomas Leigh Gatch, Jr. USAR also disappeared in his Light Heart <b>superpressure</b> balloon. Finally, on 17 August 1978, three Americans - Ben Abruzzo, Maxie Anderson, and Larry Newman crossed the Atlantic by balloon, in the Double Eagle II.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Superpressure</b> {{balloons}} {{are typically}} used for extremely long duration flights of unmanned scientific {{experiments in the}} upper atmosphere, where atmospheric gas temperature is quite stable through the diurnal cycle. In 1985 such balloons were used for aerobots flying {{at an altitude of}} approximately 50 km in the atmosphere of Venus, in the international, Soviet-led Vega program.|$|E
5000|$|A typical ARHAB flight uses a {{standard}} latex weather balloon, lasts around 2-3 hours, and reaches 25 to 35 km in altitude. Experiments with zero-pressure balloons, <b>superpressure</b> balloons, and valved latex balloons have extended flight times {{to more than}} 24 hours. A zero-pressure flight by the Spirit of Knoxville Balloon Program in March 2008 lasted over 40 hours and landed {{off the coast of}} Ireland, over 5400 km from its launch point.On December 11, 2011, the California Near Space Project flight number CNSP-11 with the call sign K6RPT-11 launched a record-breaking flight traveling 6,236 miles (10,035 km) from San Jose, California, to a splashdown in the Mediterranean Sea. The flight lasted 57 hours and 2 minutes. It became the first successful US transcontinental and first successful transatlantic amateur radio high-altitude balloon. [...] Since that time, a number of flights have circumnavigated the earth using <b>superpressure</b> plastic film balloons.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of light-gas {{balloons}}: zero-pressure and <b>superpressure.</b> Zero-pressure balloons are the traditional form of light-gas balloon. They are partially inflated with the light gas before launch, with the gas pressure the same {{both inside and outside the}} balloon. As the zero-pressure balloon rises, its gas expands to maintain the zero pressure difference, and the balloon's envelope swells.|$|E
50|$|Vincent E. Lally of NCAR {{received}} the Otto C. Winzen Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2003 for his pioneering {{work in the}} application and development of <b>superpressure</b> balloons for worldwide atmospheric measurements, including the GHOST program. Winzen was a pioneer of modern ballooning, and this award recognizes outstanding contributions {{to the advancement of}} free-flight balloon systems or related technologies.|$|E
50|$|A <b>superpressure</b> balloon is a {{style of}} aerostatic balloon where {{the volume of the}} balloon is kept {{relatively}} constant in the face of changes in the temperature of the contained lifting gas. This allows the balloon to keep a stable altitude for long periods. This is in contrast with much more common variable-volume balloons, which are either only partially filled with lifting gas, or made with more elastic materials.|$|E
50|$|One concept, {{known as}} the Titan Aerobot Multisite mission, {{involves}} a reversible-fluid balloon filled with argon that could descend from high altitude {{to the surface of}} the moon, perform measurements, and then rise again to high altitude to perform measurements and move to a different site. Another concept, the Titan Aerobot Singlesite mission, would use a <b>superpressure</b> balloon that would select a single site, vent much of its gas, and then survey that site in detail.|$|E
5000|$|The {{gas balloon}} or Charlière is {{inflated}} with a gas of lower molecular weight than the ambient atmosphere; most gas balloons operate {{with the internal}} pressure of the gas {{the same as the}} pressure of the surrounding atmosphere; a <b>superpressure</b> balloon can operate with the lifting gas at pressure that exceeds that of the surrounding air, with the objective of limiting or eliminating the loss of gas from day-time heating; gas balloons are filled with gases such as: ...|$|E
5000|$|The tandem balloon {{system is}} {{intended}} to increase the flight time of the zero-pressure balloon by damping the diurnal altitude variations caused by solar heating of the lifting gas and its subsequent expansion. As the balloons descend, the <b>superpressure</b> balloon's constant volume displaces a larger mass of the denser air, and becomes more buoyant. Likewise as they rise, the system displaces less air mass, limiting the ascent to prevent the lifting gas from expanding too far and escaping from the zero pressure balloon.|$|E
50|$|In February 1974, Colonel Thomas L. Gatch Jr, USAR {{attempted}} {{to make the first}} crossing of the Atlantic by balloon in a <b>superpressure</b> balloon named Light Heart. Following the loss of {{at least two of the}} ten balloons which provided lift and after deviating substantially from the course that Colonel Gatch had plotted to take advantage of the jet stream, the last reported sighting of the Light Heart was 1,610 km west of the Canary Islands; no further trace of the aircraft was ever found.|$|E
5000|$|JPL's MABVAP {{technology}} {{experiments were}} intended to lead to an actual Mars aerobot mission, named MABTEX, for [...] "Mars Aerobot Technology Experiment". As its name implies, MABTEX was primarily intended to be an operational technology experiment as a precursor to a more ambitious efforts. MABTEX was envisioned as a small <b>superpressure</b> balloon, carried to Mars on a [...] "microprobe" [...] weighing no more than 40 kg. Once inserted, the operational balloon would have a total mass {{of no more than}} 10 kg and would remain operational for a week. The small gondola would have navigational and control electronics, along with a stereo imaging system, as well as a spectrometer and magnetometer.|$|E
50|$|The balloon {{consisted}} of a sealed and pressurized envelope suspended from a cluster of ten helium balloons. Each of these was a <b>superpressure</b> balloon (also known as a constant pressure or positive pressure balloon.) In theory, such a balloon can retain a constant altitude over very long-distance flights of several days' duration, since {{the volume of the}} envelope remains relatively constant over time. Changes in the pressure of the gas due to heating and cooling are accommodated by mitigating the temperature changes and using an inelastic envelope. The sealed and insulated gondola, which Gatch constructed at home, was designed to maintain the same partial pressure of Oxygen as at sea level (40% oxygen at 0.5 atmospheres).|$|E
50|$|In a variable-volume balloon, {{the volume}} of the lifting gas changes due to heating and cooling in the diurnal cycle. The cycle is {{magnified}} by a greenhouse effect inside the balloon, while the surrounding atmospheric gas is subject to a much more limited cyclical temperature change. As the lift gas heats and expands, the displacement of atmospheric gas increases, while the balloon weight remains constant. Its buoyancy increases, and this leads to a rise in altitude unless it is compensated by venting gas. Conversely, if the balloon cools and drops, it becomes necessary to release ballast. Since both ballast and gas are finite, {{there is a limit to}} how long a variable-volume balloon can compensate in order to stabilize its altitude. In contrast, a <b>superpressure</b> balloon will change altitude much less without compensation maneuvers.|$|E
5000|$|By 1996, JPL {{was working}} on a {{full-fledged}} aerobot experiment named PAT, for [...] "Planetary Aerobot Testbed", which was intended to demonstrate a complete planetary aerobot through flights into Earth's atmosphere. PAT concepts envisioned a reversible-fluid balloon with a 10-kilogram payload that would include navigation and camera systems, and eventually would operate under autonomous control. The project turned out to be too ambitious, and was cancelled in 1997. JPL continued to work on a more focused, low-cost experiments to lead to a Mars aerobot, under the name MABVAP, for [...] "Mars Aerobot Validation Program". MABVAP experiments included drops of balloon systems from hot-air balloons and helicopters to validate the tricky deployment phase of a planetary aerobot mission, and development of envelopes for <b>superpressure</b> balloons with materials and structures suited to a long-duration Mars mission.|$|E
5000|$|Plans {{envisioned a}} {{follow-on}} to MABTEX as {{a much more}} sophisticated aerobot named MGA, for [...] "Mars Geoscience Aerobot". Design concepts for MGA envisioned a <b>superpressure</b> balloon system very much like that of MABTEX, but much larger. MGA would carry a payload ten times larger than that of MABTEX, and would remain aloft {{for up to three}} months, circling Mars more than 25 times and covering over 500000 km. The payload would include sophisticated equipment, such as an ultrahigh resolution stereo imager, along with oblique imaging capabilities; a radar sounder to search for subsurface water; an infrared spectroscopy system to search for important minerals; a magnetometer; and weather and atmospheric instruments. MABTEX might be followed in turn by a small solar-powered blimp named MASEPA, for [...] "Mars Solar Electric Propelled Aerobot".|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to leading the national program to develop facilities for scientific ballooning, Lally {{made a number}} of major contribution to the use of balloons as a vehicle for atmospheric measurements. The demonstration of the capability to fly <b>superpressure</b> balloons on multiple orbits of the globe was the critical experiment which triggered international support for the Global Atmospheric Research Program. In 1966, NCAR scientists launched a globe-circling balloon from Christchurch, New Zealand. This was {{one of a series of}} GHOST (global horizontal sounding technique) balloons tested in order to collect meteorological data from all of the earth's atmosphere and predict global weather on a long-range basis. The ROBIN (Rocket-Balloon-Instrument) sphere, designed in 1955, was the principal vehicle for rocket soundings of the atmosphere. Lally also developed the technique for reliable erection of space-inflatables. The Radiation-Controlled Balloon (RACOON) demonstrated in 1980 that the radiation-environment rather than ballast could achieve long-duration flight for zero-pressure balloons. It became the standard technique for global flight and recovery of heavy scientific payloads.|$|E

40|$|The {{response}} of a <b>superpressure</b> balloon to an initial displacement from its constant-density floating level is examined. An approximate solution is obtained to the governing vertical {{equation of motion}} for constant-density <b>superpressure</b> balloons. This solution is used to filter out neutrally buoyant oscillations in balloon records despite the nonlinear behavior of the balloon. The graph depicting the pressure data after deconvolution between the raw pressure data and the normalized balloon wavelet shows clearly the strong filtering-out of the neutral buoyancy oscillations...|$|E
40|$|Electric {{field and}} {{conductivity}} measurements {{in the stratosphere}} between November 1992 and March 1993 have been made using <b>superpressure</b> balloons in the southern hemisphere. Over 400 payload-days of data have been made during a record setting experiment called ELBBO (Extended Life Balloon Borne Observatories). This experiment resulted in 4 flights aloft simultaneously for over 2 months including one flight which lasted over 4 months. Electrodynamical coupling between the atmosphere and ionosphere is studied using the measured electric fields, and a simple empirical model of the stratospheric conductivity. Altitude profiles of conductivity have been obtained from several <b>superpressure</b> balloon flights using the large end-of-flight altitude swings on {{the last few days}} of each flight (as the balloon begins to loose <b>superpressure).</b> Coupling between the fields and atmospheric inertial waves has been observed. Effects and dynamics of the global circuit suggest that standard models are missing significant phenomena. Large scale ionospheric convection activity has been studied from the polar cap to the middle latitudes. Cusp latitude fields have been continuously measured for many days in a row...|$|E
40|$|The <b>superpressure</b> balloon was {{developed}} to provide a method of obtaining global winds at all altitudes from 5 to 30 km. If a balloon {{could be made to}} fly for several weeks at a constant altitude, and if it could be tracked accurately on its global circuits, the balloon would provide a tag for the air parcel in which it was embedded. The Lagrangian data on the atmospheric circulation would provide a superior data input to the numerical model. The Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) was initiated in large part based on the promise of this technique coupled with free-floating ocean buoys and satellite radiometers. The initial name proposed by Charney for GARP was SABABURA 'SAtellite BAlloon BUoy RAdiometric system' (Charney, 1966). However, although the <b>superpressure</b> balloon exceeded its designers' expectations for flight duration in the stratosphere (longest flight duration of 744 days), flight duration below 10 km was limited by icing in super-cooled clouds to a few days. The balloon was relegated to a secondary role during the GARP Special Observing Periods. The several major <b>superpressure</b> balloon programs for global wind measurement are described as well as those new developments which make the balloon once again an attractive vehicle for measurement of global winds as a reference and bench-mark system for future satellite systems...|$|E

40|$|A {{project was}} {{conducted}} during September 1969 {{to determine the}} structure of the atmosphere over the Colorado Rocky Mountains from 4 - 70 km. Chaff was ejected from gun projectiles at 60 - 70 km altitude. <b>Superpressure</b> balloons were flown in the mid- and upper-troposphere. Ozone sensors were flown to heights of 37 km. Wave motion appears to be evident in the mesospheric chaff data. A spectral analysis is performed on the components of motion of the chaff to determine primary modes. A velocity of 53 m s-l and vertical shear of 35 m s-l km- 1 were recorded in the mid-mesosphere. There is a slight suggestion that the autumn high-altitude wind reversal might have occurred in thin layers, since thin layers of easterlies embedded in a basic westerly flow were seen the last of September. Wave motion is also evident in the <b>superpressure</b> balloon data. Four ozonesondes were released at three-hour intervals. During tha...|$|E
