40|$|Many prey species gather {{together}} to approach and harass their predators despite the associated risks. While mobbing, prey usually utter calls and previous experiments {{have demonstrated that}} mobbing calls can convey information about risk to conspecifics. However, the risk posed by predators also differs between predator categories. The ability to communicate predator category would be adaptive because it would allow other mobbers to adjust their risk taking. I tested this idea in <b>Siberian</b> <b>jays</b> Perisoreus infaustus, a group-living bird species, by exposing jay groups to mounts of three hawk and three owl species of varying risks. Groups immediately approached to mob the mount and uttered up to 14 different call types. Jays gave more calls when mobbing a more dangerous predator and when {{in the presence of}} kin. Five call types were predator-category-specific and jays uttered two hawk-specific and three owl-specific call types. Thus, {{this is one of the}} first studies to demonstrate that mobbing calls can simultaneously encode information about both predator category and the risk posed by a predator.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{techniques}} for recognizing individuals in avian field research is marking birds with plastic and metal leg rings. However, in some species individuals may react negatively to rings, causing leg injuries and, in extreme cases, {{the loss of a}} foot or limb. Here, we report problems that arise from ringing and illustrate solutions based on field data from Brown Thornbills (Acanthiza pusilla) (2 populations), <b>Siberian</b> <b>Jays</b> (Perisoreus infaustus) and Purple-crowned Fairy-wrens (Malurus coronatus). We encountered three problems caused by plastic rings: inflammations triggered by material accumulating under the ring (Purple-crowned Fairy-wrens), contact inflammations as a consequence of plastic rings touching the foot or tibio-tarsal joint (Brown Thornbills), and toes or the foot getting trapped in partly unwrapped flat-band colour rings (<b>Siberian</b> <b>Jays).</b> Metal rings caused two problems: the edges of aluminium rings bent inwards if mounted {{on top of each other}} (Brown Thornbills), and too small a ring size led to inflammation (Purple-crowned Fairy-wrens). We overcame these problems by changing the ringing technique (using different ring types or larger rings), or using different adhesive. Additionally, we developed and tested a novel, simple technique of gluing plastic rings onto metal rings in Brown Thornbills.

40|$|Kin {{recognition}} {{is a critical}} element to kin cooperation, and in vertebrates, it is primarily based on associative learning. Recognition of socially unfamiliar kin occurs rarely, and it is reported only in vertebrate species where promiscuity prevents recognition of first-order relatives. However, it is unknown whether the recognition of socially unfamiliar kin can evolve in monogamous species. Here, we investigate whether genetic relatedness modulates aggression among group members in <b>Siberian</b> <b>jays</b> (Perisoreus infaustus). This bird species is genetically and socially monogamous and lives in groups that are formed through the retention of offspring beyond independence, and the immigration of socially unfamiliar nonbreeders. Observations on feeders showed that genetic relatedness modulated aggression of breeders towards immigrants in a graded manner, in that they chased most intensely the immigrant group members that were genetically the least related. However, cross-fostering experiments showed that breeders were equally tolerant towards their own and cross-fostered young swapped as nestlings. Thus, breeders seem to use different mechanisms to recognize socially unfamiliar individuals and own offspring. As <b>Siberian</b> <b>jays</b> show {{a high degree of}} nepotism during foraging and predator encounters, inclusive fitness benefits may play a role for the evolution of fine-scale kin recognition. More generally, our results suggest that fine-graded kin recognition can evolve independently of social familiarity, highlighting the evolutionary importance of kin recognition for social species...|$|R

40|$|Extrinsic {{mortality}} has {{a strong}} impact {{on the evolution of}} life-histories, prey morphology and behavioural adaptations, but for many animals the causes of mortality are poorly understood. Predation is an important driver of extrinsic mortality and mobile animals form groups in response to increased predation risk. Furthermore, in many species juveniles suffer higher mortality than older individuals, which may reflect a lower phenotypic quality, lower competitiveness, or a lack of antipredator or foraging skills. Here we assessed the causes of mortality for 371 radio tagged <b>Siberian</b> <b>jays.</b> This sedentary bird species lives in family groups that contain a breeding pair as well as related and unrelated non-breeders. Ninety-five percent of death were due to predation (n = 59 out of 62 individuals) and most individuals were killed by Accipiter hawks. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models showed that non-breeders had a lower survival than breeders, but only in territories in managed forest with little visual cover. Examining breeders, only sex influenced survival with males having a lower survival than females. For non-breeders, juveniles had lower survival than older non-breeders, and those on managed territories had lower survival than those on unmanaged territories. Additionally, a low feather quality reduced the survival probability of non-breeders only. Thus, living on managed territories and having a low feature quality affected only non-breeders, particularly juveniles. These findings add to previous research demonstrating that juvenile <b>Siberian</b> <b>jays</b> acquire critical antipredator skills from experienced group members. Thus, experience can buffer extrinsic mortality, highlighting that group living not only provides safety in numbers, but also provide social opportunities to learn critical life-skills...|$|R
40|$|Optimal {{foraging}} models tend {{to assume}} that animals have perfect information. However, the world is constantly changing, {{and so it is}} likely that animals benefit from gathering better knowledge much of the time. Therefore, animals should exploit what they know to be the most profitable foraging options, but also invest some optimal level of effort in sampling. Sampling is when an animal investigates alternative foraging options in order to find out which is the best one to utilize at the current time. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if the <b>Siberian</b> <b>jays</b> (Perisoreus infaustus) used sampling and public information to exploit the best combination of different foraging patches of variable profitability. This was done using an experimental feeding platform containing a number of different randomly arranged patches each consisting of four closely spaced colour-coded tubes (i. e. one-shot feeders), each containing the same of one of five different sizes of food items (sausage pieces). Overall, the jays exploited significantly more tubes in patches that contained large sausage items than would be expected at random. This foraging success better than chance was achieved using a long-term approximation of the win-stay lose-shift strategy i. e. the birds used information provided by a tube to either come back to the same patch again if a large item was obtained (success), or shift to sample a new patch if a small item was obtained (no success). Hence, if a tube with large item was opened, the birds were more likely to return to this patch again. However, they did not always return immediately since no significant influence of the previous success was found, suggesting a longer-term strategy involving more than one patch at a time. In addition, the birds opened significantly more tubes containing large items than chance when visiting new patches that other birds had already visited, suggesting some use of public as well as private information. It therefore seems that <b>Siberian</b> <b>jays</b> try to maximize their food intake over the whole trial period and not just per visit. They do this by deviating from a simple win-stay lose-shift strategy, keeping the profitability of more than just two patches in mind at any one time and by exploiting the public information provided by the sampling behaviour of other birds...|$|R
40|$|SummaryPredation is a {{powerful}} agent of natural selection, driving the evolution of antipredator calls [1]. These calls {{have been shown to}} communicate predator category [2 – 4] and/or predator distance to conspecifics [5 – 7]. However, the risk posed by predators depends also on predator behavior [8], and the ability of prey to communicate predator behavior to conspecifics would be a selective advantage reducing their predation risk. I tested this idea in <b>Siberian</b> <b>jays</b> (Perisoreus infaustus), a group-living bird species. Predation by hawks, {{and to a lesser extent}} by owls, is substantial and the sole cause of mortality in adult jays [9]. By using field data and predator-exposure experiments, I show here that jays used antipredator calls for hawks depending on predator behavior. A playback experiment demonstrated that these prey-to-prey calls were specific to hawk behavior (perch, prey search, attack) and elicited distinct, situation-specific escape responses. This is the first study to demonstrate that prey signals convey information about predator behavior to conspecifics. Given that antipredator calls in jays aim at protecting kin group members [10, 11], consequently lowering their mortality [9], kin-selected benefits could be an important factor for the evolution of predator-behavior-specific antipredator calls in such systems...|$|R

40|$|Variance {{sensitivity}} theory {{predicts that}} optimal foragers should {{take into account}} not only the mean but also the variance in rewards offered by alternative foraging options. Whereas a positive energy budget should favor variance aversion, a negative one should favor variance-prone choices. The risk of starvation is the most obvious fitness threshold that can select for variance-prone behavior, but additional thresholds may exist such as the energy required for reproduction. Previous studies of variance sensitivity have often been performed in captivity, and few have demonstrated the predicted state-dependent changes in individual variance preferences. We trained groups of wild <b>Siberian</b> <b>jays</b> (Perisoreus infaustus) to forage from one-shot feeders containing 3 color-coded options differing only in the variance of reward sizes. Not only did we find variance-sensitive behavior under natural conditions but also, for the first time, demonstrate the presence of significant differences in variance sensitivity within groups. Breeders exhibited a preference for high-variance rewards, whereas unrelated subordinates within the same groups preferred low-variance options. These results did not reflect risk of starvation (indexed by body mass) but might {{be explained by the}} additional energy needs of breeders compared with subordinates prior to the breeding season.

40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} phenotypic differentiation in mean body size is of commonplace occurrence, but {{the underlying causes}} remain often unclear: both genetic differentiation in response to selection (or drift) and environmentally induced plasticity can create similar phenotypic patterns. Studying changes in body mass in <b>Siberian</b> <b>jays</b> (Perisoreus infaustus) over three decades, we discovered that mean body mass declined drastically (ca. 10 %) over the first two decades, but increased markedly thereafter back to almost the initial level. Quantitative genetic analyses revealed that although body mass was heritable (h 2  =  0. 46), the pronounced temporal decrease in body mass was mainly a product of phenotypic plasticity. However, a concomitant and statistically significant decrease in predicted breeding values suggests a genetic component to this change. The subsequent increase in mean body mass was indicated to be entirely due to plasticity. Selection on body mass {{was estimated to be}} too weak to fully account for the observed genetic decline in body mass, but bias in selection differential estimates due to environmental covariance between body mass and fitness is possible. Hence, the observed body mass changes appear to be driven mainly by phenotypic plasticity. Although {{we were not able to}} identify the ecological driver of the observed plastic changes, the results highlight the utility of quantitative genetic approaches in disentangling genetic and phenotypic changes in natural populations...|$|R
40|$|Dispersal is a {{fundamental}} process affecting the genetic structure of populations, speciation, and extinction. Nevertheless, {{our understanding of the}} evolution of dispersal is limited by our paucity of knowledge on dispersal decisions at the individual level. We investigated the effect of interactions between residents and juvenile dispersers on individual dispersal and settlement decisions in <b>Siberian</b> <b>jays</b> (Perisoreus infaustus). In this group-living bird species, some offspring remain on the parental territory for up to 3 years (retained juveniles) whereas other offspring disperse within 2 months of fledging (dispersers). We found that retained juveniles constrained settlement decisions of dispersers by aggressively chasing dispersers off their territory, resulting in dispersers continuing to disperse and settling in groups without retained juveniles. Experimental removal of male breeders during the dispersal period also demonstrated that dispersers were unable to settle in high-quality breeding openings, which were instead filled by older nonbreeding residents. Rather, dispersers immigrated into groups without retained offspring where they became subordinate group members, queuing for a breeding opening. Also, they preferably settled in groups with short queues where no same-sex juveniles were present. Dispersal did not inflict a cost to dispersers through increased mortality. However, the presence of immigrants was costly for breeders because it increased the rate of conflicts during the breeding season which negatively affected nestling condition. These results demonstrate that resident individuals constrain both dispersal and settlement decisions of dispersers. Social interactions between residents and dispersers can thus be a key factor to understand the evolution of dispersal. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of natural populations {{may be influenced}} by a variety of factors, ranging from feeding interference and territoriality to the risk of predation and climatic effects. The relative influence of these factors may be contingent upon the quality of the habitat in which individuals reside. A factor that can largely affect population dynamics and that often covaries with habitat structure is predation risk. However, the combined effect of habitat and predation risk can vary according to the social context and intrinsic characteristics that affect individual behavioural responses. This thesis investigates the effects of habitat quality {{at the level of the}} population and the individual, and examines how it relates to the above factors in <b>Siberian</b> <b>jays</b> (Perisoreus infaustus), a territorial, group-living species in which the main cause of mortality is predation. The results demonstrate a strong effect of habitat on survival, reproduction and behaviour. Mortality was generally higher in open areas and managed forests and reproductive success decreased after forest management. Breeding females were more sensitive to environmental factors than males, possibly because of higher reproductive costs. Estimates of spatial demography suggested that there were more sinks than sources, and that they were located in open, managed forests. Behavioural decisions confirmed that open forests were associated with higher predation risks. However, decisions depended on social context; immigrants took highest risks and were the recipients of most aggression, largely an effect of social subordination. Also, parents provide their offspring with benefits that are withheld from immigrants. As a result, first-year survival was higher in retained offspring. Investigating the effects of multi-scale habitat quality on individual behaviour and population dynamics has generated an increased understanding of the effects of forest management on the {{dynamics of}} this population.

During a long-term study in Finland 1974 - 2000, we observed <b>Siberian</b> <b>Jay</b> group composition in autumn. Using microsatellite analysis based on feather or blood samples we clarified kin relations within the groups. We found that out of 311 groups that included {{at least one more}} individual than the territory holders, 74 % were nuclear families, including breeding birds and 1 - 3 retained offspring. However, 26 % of the groups were not families, but consisted of pairs accompanied only by individuals that were not their offspring. According to extensive pedigrees we found that 70 % of the 82 immatures associated with a nonparent pair were not related to either territory holder. Of these 82 immatures, 91 % were associated with pairs that had no offspring on their own, suggesting that they were failed breeders or newly established pairs. The composition of groups was mostly unchanged during the observation period within each season, regardless of kinship. Previous studies have reported apparent nepotism between parents and retained offspring in the <b>Siberian</b> <b>Jay,</b> and a high degree of aggression toward nonoffspring, so we did not expect to find such high frequency and remarkable within-season stability of nonfamily groups. These observations suggest that there are important fitness benefits to gain from territoriality and group living, regardless of kinship...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Genomic {{resources}} {{for the majority of}} free-living vertebrates of ecological and evolutionary importance are scarce. Therefore, linkage maps with high-density genome coverage are needed for progress in genomics of wild species. The <b>Siberian</b> <b>jay</b> (Perisoreus infaustus; Corvidae) is a passerine bird which has been subject to lots of research in the areas of ecology and evolutionary biology. Knowledge of its genome structure and organization is required to advance our understanding of the genetic basis of ecologically important traits in this species, as well as to provide insights into avian genome evolution. Results We describe the first genetic linkage map of <b>Siberian</b> <b>jay</b> constructed using 117 microsatellites and a mapping pedigree of 349 animals representing five families from a natural population breeding in western Finland from the years 1975 to 2006. Markers were resolved into nine autosomal and a Z-chromosome-specific linkage group, 10 markers remaining unlinked. The best-position map with the most likely positions of all significantly linked loci had a total sex-average size of 862. 8 cM, with an average interval distance of 9. 69 cM. The female map covered 988. 4 cM, whereas the male map covered only 774 cM. The Z-chromosome linkage group comprised six markers, three pseudoautosomal and three sex-specific loci, and spanned 10. 6 cM in females and 48. 9 cM in males. Eighty-one of the mapped loci could be ordered on a framework map with odds of > 1000 : 1 covering a total size of 809. 6 cM in females and 694. 2 cM in males. Significant sex specific distortions towards reduced male recombination rates were revealed in the entire best-position map as well as within two autosomal linkage groups. Comparative mapping between <b>Siberian</b> <b>jay</b> and chicken anchored 22 homologous loci on 6 different linkage groups corresponding to chicken chromosomes Gga 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and Z. Quite a few cases of intra-chromosomal rearrangements within the autosomes and three cases of inter-chromosomal rearrangement between the <b>Siberian</b> <b>jay</b> autosomal linkage groups (LG 1, LG 2 and LG 3) and the chicken sex chromosome GgaZ were observed, suggesting a conserved synteny, but changes in marker order, within autosomes during about 100 million years of avian evolution. Conclusion The constructed linkage map represents a valuable resource for intraspecific genomics of <b>Siberian</b> <b>jay,</b> as well as for avian comparative genomic studies. Apart from providing novel insights into sex-specific recombination rates and patterns, the described maps – from a previously genomically uncharacterized superfamily (Corvidae) of passerine birds – provide new insights into avian genome evolution. In combination with high-resolution data on quantitative trait variability from the study population, they also provide a foundation for QTL-mapping studies. </p...|$|E

Population sizes of these species have declined in association with fragmentation and loss of suitable forest habitat due to modern forestry practices in Fennoscandia. The red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) served as a reference for the flying squirrel. Genetic differentiation among species studied ranged from a panmictic population in the Siberian tit {{to that of the}} strong differentiation of populations (θST =  53 %) in the flying squirrel in Finland. MtDNA and microsatellite data, together with assignment studies, showed the <b>Siberian</b> <b>jay</b> population to be significantly genetically structured and supported the existence of a metapopulation like structuring in Fennoscandia. Division of genetic variation among flying squirrel populations along the ancient shoreline of the Littorina Lymnea Sea stage of the Baltic Sea (7000 BP) and two geographically associated branches in the minimum spanning network supported a two-way colonisation history for the species. The Finnish inland appears to have been colonised from the east in association with the arrival of Norway spruce. At the same time, Coastal Finland was colonised from the south-east through the Karelian Isthmus. Gene flow of the species appeared female biased and restricted. Species exhibiting more restrictive dispersal characteristics and habitat requirements possessed stronger population genetic structure than those with opposite characteristics. Growth or contractions in population size leave characteristic signatures in mtDNA that can be studied by comparing different sequence diversity estimates among populations. I applied this method to the species studied. Significant differences in nucleotide diversities indicated restrictions in gene flow among populations in all species studied. Half of the <b>Siberian</b> <b>jay</b> populations gave a signal of population size bottleneck. All the species studied showed differences in their population genetic structures across their entire distribution ranges consistent with the multirefugia model, most likely to be attributable to differences in their ecological characteristics and Pleistocene histories...|$|E
