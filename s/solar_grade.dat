50|$|Polysilicon is {{produced}} from {{metallurgical grade silicon}} by a chemical purification process, called the Siemens process. This process involves distillation of volatile silicon compounds, and their decomposition into silicon at high temperatures. An emerging, alternative process of refinement uses a fluidized bed reactor. The photovoltaic industry also produces upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon (UMG-Si), using metallurgical instead of chemical purification processes. When produced for the electronics industry, polysilicon contains impurity levels of less than one part per billion (ppb), while polycrystalline <b>solar</b> <b>grade</b> silicon (SoG-Si) is generally less pure.

The Danpalon Heatstop, reflective grey in colour, was finally chosen for its overall efficiencies but additionally, the <b>solar</b> transmission <b>grade</b> was to vary and suit the building’s orientation. The resulting solution was to use 1% solar transmitting material on the roof, 3.5% solar transmission on the eastern and western walls, and the basic 18% solar transmission on the northern and southern elevations. Less heat is transferred into the building and artificial lighting is not required at all during the day.|$|R
50|$|At reduced {{pressure}} levels for VLSI manufacturing, polysilicon deposition rate below 575 °C is {{too slow to}} be practical. Above 650 °C, poor deposition uniformity and excessive roughness will be encountered due to unwanted gas-phase reactions and silane depletion. Pressure can be varied inside a low-pressure reactor either by changing the pumping speed or changing the inlet gas flow into the reactor. If the inlet gas is composed of both silane and nitrogen, the inlet gas flow, and hence the reactor pressure, may be varied either by changing the nitrogen flow at constant silane flow, or changing both the nitrogen and silane flow to change the total gas flow while keeping the gas ratio constant. Recent investigations have shown that e-beam evaporation, followed by SPC (if needed) can be a cost effective and faster alternative for producing <b>solar</b> <b>grade</b> poly-Si thin films.

5000|$|Polycrystalline and paracrystalline phases are {{composed}} {{of a number of}} smaller crystals or crystallites.

5000|$|Despite the {{numerous}} attempts at making better solar cells by using new and exotic materials, {{the reality is}} that the photovoltaics market is still dominated by silicon wafer-based solar cells (first-generation solar cells). This means that most solar cell manufacturers are currently equipped to produce this type of solar cells. Consequently, a large body of research is being done all over the world to manufacture silicon wafer-based solar cells at lower cost and to increase the conversion efficiencies without an exorbitant increase in production cost. The ultimate goal for both wafer-based and alternative photovoltaic concepts is to produce solar electricity at a cost comparable to currently market-dominant coal, natural gas, and nuclear power in order to make it the leading primary energy source. To achieve this it may be necessary to reduce the cost of installed solar systems from currently about US$1.80 (for bulk Si technologies) to about US$0.50 per Watt peak power. Since a major part of the final cost of a traditional bulk silicon module is related to the high cost of <b>solar</b> <b>grade</b> polysilicon feedstock (about US$0.4/Watt peak) there exists substantial drive to make Si solar cells thinner (material savings) or to make solar cells from cheaper upgraded metallurgical silicon (so called [...] "dirty Si").|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Actinic keratosis (AK) is a premalignant lesion {{caused by}} {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation and characterized by epithelial and connective tissue alterations. However, {{little is known}} about the link between connective and UV-damaged epithelial tissues in AK. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To examine the potential relationship between connective tissue degeneration and molecular alterations in epithelial cells without evident morphologic changes, 30 cases of AK (8, grade I; 10, grade II; 12, grade III), divided into three grades according to the proportion of dermal elastosis (in grade I, up to 30 % of collagen degeneration; in grade II, 30 - 60 %; in grade III, more than 60 %), were immunohistochemically analyzed for the expression of Ki 67, p 53, p 63, bcl- 2, E-cadherin, 34 -betaE 12, and CD 99. RESULTS: The increase in the <b>solar</b> elastosis <b>grade</b> was associated with an increase in positive cell numbers for all analyzed markers. Basal expression predominated in the lesions with low and moderate levels of connective tissue degeneration, while a basal and suprabasal expression pattern was prevalent in the lesions with high degeneration. In grade I and II lesions, proliferation marker, Ki 67, expression was found to be significantly associated with the proapoptotic marker p 53, while in grade III lesions, its expression was correlated with the anti-apoptotic marker, bcl- 2. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the epithelial expression of apoptotic, cell proliferation, and structural proteins is augmented with the increase of the <b>solar</b> elastosis <b>grade.</b> Thus, the <b>grade</b> of <b>solar</b> elastosis could be a helpful morphologic marker in the assessment of neoplastic changes in sun-damaged skin...|$|R
