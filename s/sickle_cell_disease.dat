5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is not {{toxic to}} {{all forms of}} life. Its harmful effects are due to binding with hemoglobin so its danger to organisms that do not use this compound is doubtful. It thus {{has no effect on}} photosynthesising plants. It is easily absorbed through the lungs. Inhaling the gas can lead to hypoxic injury, nervous system damage, and even death. Different people and populations may have different carbon monoxide tolerance levels. On average, exposures at 100 ppm or greater is dangerous to human health. In the United States, the OSHA limits long-term workplace exposure levels to less than 50 ppm averaged over an 8-hour period; in addition, employees are to be removed from any confined space if an upper limit ("ceiling") of 100 ppm is reached. Carbon monoxide exposure may lead to a significantly shorter life span due to heart damage. The carbon monoxide tolerance level for any person is altered by several factors, including activity level, rate of ventilation, a pre-existing cerebral or cardiovascular disease, cardiac output, anemia, <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> <b>disease</b> and other hematological disorders, barometric pressure, and metabolic rate.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sickle</b> <b>cell</b> <b>diseases</b> (SCD) or <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> anemia (SCA) is a hemoglobinopathy that {{is mostly}} common among per-sons of African descent [1]. SCD arises from a single, point-mutation (base-substitution of Adenine with Thy-mine {{in the sixth}} codon: CAG!CTG) of the gene cod-ing for the beta chain of the Hemoglobin {{molecule}} [2]. The phenotypic consequence of this substitution is a re-placement of the amino acid glutamic acid (E) with val-ine (V) [1, 2]. Homozygous expression of this mutant globin genotype (SS) causes SCD, while the heterozygous genotype (AS) is termed the “sickle cell trait ” [1, 2]. Un-like the case observed in most normal adult humans where the commonest hemoglobin type (hemoglobin A or Hb A) is a tetramer (which contains 4 subunit pro-teins- α 2 β 2 A that are non-covalently bound together), patients with SCD have an adult hemoglobin type wit...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Pain control {{measures}} in <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> <b>diseases</b> are not uniform. Most clinicians use parenteral morphine or meperidine for severe pain.

Acceptance of morphine has been poor among patients, and many prefer meperidine. The aim of this retrospective {{study was to determine the}} incidence of meperidine-associated seizures in a large, mostly pediatric population with sickling disorders. The results suggest that the incidence of seizures with meperidine is extremely small (0. 4 % of patients; 0. 06 % of admissions). The risk of seizures should not dissuade clinicians from using this drug. Clin Pediatr. 1999; 38 : 459 - 46...|$|R
40|$|Background <b>Sickle</b> <b>cell</b> {{disorders}} (SCD) are {{the most}} common inherited blood disorders in England. Without prompt diagnosis and proper treatment, they can be a serious source of morbidity and mortality. <b>Sickle</b> <b>cell</b> <b>diseases</b> affect mainly black minority and ethnic populations, and have so far received relatively low priority from a health policy perspective. Antenatal and newborn screening, the development of minimum standards, antibiotic prophylaxis, comprehensive immunisations, and preventive diagnostic tests have positively influenced SCD management. There remains an unclear picture as to the trends and health care utilization of patients with SCD in England. Aims This study looks at the burden of disease in England by assessing hospital admissions, readmissions and related costs. It also aims to identify gaps in care and prevention which may identify possible contributors to avoidable admissions. Findings Using Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data, trends for SCD hospital admissions in England showed a rise in 50...|$|R
