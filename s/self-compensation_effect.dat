X-ray diffraction {{and transmission}} electron microscopy demonstrate the single crystalline wurtzite structure of the CdS/Sn nanowires. Both donor and acceptor levels, which originate from {{the amphoteric nature of}} Sn in II–VI semiconductors, are identified using low-temperature microphotoluminescence. This <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effect</b> was cross examined by gate modulation and temperature-dependent electrical transport measurement. They show an overall n-type behavior with relatively low carrier concentration and low carrier mobilities.

40|$|The {{effects of}} group-IV element dopants on the {{structural}} and electrical properties of Cu 2 O thin films were studied. Similar dopant-induced behavior {{was found in}} the observed variations of the growth orientation and electrical properties of Si- and Ge-doped Cu 2 O thin films. Ge doping was found to induce electrically active acceptors with an activation energy of 0. 18 eV, comparable to the 0. 19 eV value of Si-doped Cu 2 O. These results suggest that locally formed silicate and germanate have the same effect on the structural and electrical properties of Cu 2 O. On the other hand, Sn and Pb likely act as donors when incorporated substitutionally onto Cu-lattice sites, although further study may be required to suppress <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effects</b> in Cu 2 O to achieve n-type conductivity...|$|R

Since Si-donor is the most common defect in Si-doped GaAs, we study mainly several Si-donor based configurations, from the isolated impurity to extended defect configurations, up to the limit of an entire embedded donor interlayer. We consider also donor-acceptor configurations, stimulated by the experimental evidence of <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effects</b> in particular in highly doped samples. The systematic study of simulated cross-sectional STM images for all these and other configurations allows not only to identify the self-compensated donor-acceptor configurations as the simplest ones which are compatible with those experimental observations, but also to exclude most of the other candidates...|$|R
40|$|The {{compensation}} and <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effects</b> in Mg-doped GaN is studied by low-temperature photo-luminescence and Raman spectroscopy using {{a series of}} samples with different Mg concentrations. Strongly doped samples {{are found to be}} highly compensated in electrical measurement. The compensation mechanism {{is directly related to the}} incorporation of Mg leading to the additional formation of three dif-ferent deep donor levels. Furthermore, hydrogen forms defect complexes with Mg and compensates the acceptor states. These complexes were observed as local vibrational modes in Raman spectra in the range of 2200 cm– 1. The direct incorporation of Mg can be controlled by local vibrational modes in the region of GaN host phonons. Investigating the intensity dependence of the different Mg–H complexes and the LVM of activated Mg the Raman spectra give a clear direct evidence of the degree of {{compensation and}} p-conductivity. © 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|Materials {{with zero}} thermal {{expansion}} (ZTE) or precisely tailored thermal expansion are in urgent demand of modern industries. However, {{the overwhelming majority}} of materials show positive thermal expansion. To develop ZTE or negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials as compensators has become an important challenge. Here, we present the evidence for the realization of ultra-low thermal expansion in Mn–Co–Ge–In particles. The bulk with the Ni 2 In-type hexagonal structure undergoes giant NTE owing to a martensitic magnetostructural transition. The major finding is that the thermal expansion behavior can be totally controlled by modulating the crystallinity degree and phase transition from atomic scale. <b>Self-compensation</b> <b>effect</b> leads to ultra-low thermal expansion with a linear expansion coefficient as small as + 0. 68 × 10 − 6 /K over a wide temperature range around room temperature.

30|$|However, {{this kind}} of growth proposes a new method to control the N: ZnO structure. Furthermore, {{there is a big}} {{difference}} for the carrier concentration and mobility at different oxidation stages. These provide possibility to prepare p-type ZnO and to improve the concentration and mobility of the carrier. In our study, there are several reasons that lead to the n-type formation and the low carrier concentration and mobility. (1) The substrate temperature maintains at room temperature the deposition of the as-deposited Zn-N film in this study. There are a lot of donor impurities (oxygen vacancy, interstitial zinc, etc.) [42], which lead to a strong <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effect</b> after oxidation. (2) N content is too low. The lower N concentration results in the lower N substitution in the O lattice (No). This leads to the formation of n-type N: ZnO and the decrease of carrier concentration. In addition, this leads to the electrical properties of the films which are similar with those of the pure ZnO thin film (n-type) and also the lower carrier concentration [43]. Furthermore, the insulating quartz substrate is nonconductive to generate p-type semiconductors [44].|$|E
30|$|From the {{development}} of Ga 2 O 3, this material still has some disadvantages as follows. (1) P-type doping is a big challenge of Ga 2 O 3 material. Because the acceptor levels are far from the valence band of β-Ga 2 O 3, the activation energy of acceptor impurities is very high. Meanwhile, the n-type background impurities in Ga 2 O 3 crystal will also produce <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effect</b> on acceptor impurities, resulting to the self-insulating of the material. Therefore, there still has been no effective p-type doing. (2) The thermal conductivity of Ga 2 O 3 is too low. Experimental and theoretical investigations have proved that the thermal conductivity of β-Ga 2 O 3 is just only 0.1 – 0.3  W cm− 1  K− 1 [51 – 53]. This is adverse to the power device used in high-voltage and high-current circumstance. Excessive heat accumulation will seriously affect the performance and reliability of the device. (3) Carrier mobility is low. The theoretical mobility of Ga 2 O 3 is limited to about 200  cm 2 /V s due {{to the influence of}} scattering [54]. Low mobility has a negative impact on the frequency and current characteristics.|$|E
40|$|Extraordinary oxidant-dependent {{changes in}} the {{thermoelectric}} properties of undoped ZnO thin films deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) have been observed. Specifically, deionized water and ozone oxidants {{are used in the}} growth of ZnO by ALD using diethylzinc as a zinc precursor. No substitutional atoms {{have been added to the}} ZnO films. By using ozone as an oxidant instead of water, a thermoelectric power factor (σS) of 5. 76 × 10 W m K is obtained at 705 K for undoped ZnO films. In contrast, the maximum power factor for the water-based ZnO film is only 2. 89 × 10 W m K at 746 K. Materials analysis results indicate that the oxygen vacancy levels in the water- and ozone-grown ZnO films are essentially the same, but the difference comes from Zn-related defects present in the ZnO films. The data suggest that the strong oxidant effect on thermoelectric performance can be explained by a mechanism involving point defect-induced differences in carrier concentration between these two oxides and a <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effect</b> in water-based ZnO due to the competitive formations of both oxygen and zinc vacancies. This strong oxidant effect on the thermoelectric properties of undoped ZnO films provides a pathway to improve the thermoelectric performance of this important material...|$|E
40|$|The {{utilization}} of osmosis for engineered applications sparked off various emerging technologies relying on osmotically driven membrane processes (ODMPs). Represented by forward osmosis (FO) and pressure retarded osmosis (PRO), ODMPs show great promise to leverage the global water-energy nexus and have drawn considerable attention in recent years. However, their performance in practical applications is significantly affected by membrane fouling. Membrane fouling {{is a complex}} problem and {{is associated with the}} foulant deposition, concentration polarization and reverse solute diffusion (RSD) in ODMPs. The current paper provides a comprehensive review on membrane fouling in ODMPs with a focus on the elaboration of the factors and mechanisms governing the fouling behavior. Among those fouling factors and mechanisms, some are also applicable for pressure-driven membrane processes (e. g., reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF)), such as the effects of hydrodynamic conditions, feedwater composition, and membrane material and properties, and the cake-enhanced concentration polarization (CE-CP) mechanism. Others are unique for ODMPs, such as the effects of draw solution composition and membrane orientation, the internal concentration polarization (ICP) <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effect,</b> and the RSD-enhanced fouling. A general osmotic-resistance filtration model for ODMPs is presented in this paper to assist in the interpretation of the intrinsic interrelationships among those fouling factors and mechanisms. The impact and mechanisms of membrane fouling on contaminates removal are also reviewed briefly based on the limited existing literature on this topic. Finally, the available membrane fouling control strategies for ODMPs are summarized upon understanding the cause and effect of fouling. Based on the current review, future research prospects are proposed for further studying the membrane fouling in ODMPs...|$|E
30|$|Semiconductor {{nanoparticles}} termed {{quantum dots}} (QDs) have drawn wide attention {{in recent years}} as light-emitting source for light-emitting diode (LED) applications, whose emission spectrum with narrow linewidth can be tuned by changing the energy bandgaps with the variation in QD sizes and shapes [1 – 7]. Numerous experiments present in literature on the high-performance electroluminescence (EL) properties of LEDs based on CdS [8, 9], CdSe [10, 11], and PbS [12, 13] colloidal QD thin film. However, the widespread employment of heavy metal ions, particularly Cd and Pb, are a serious hazard to human health {{as well as to the}} environment [14]. Therefore, it necessitates alternative approaches for developing QD-LEDs with the heavy-metal free composition. Nontoxic ZnO QDs with a tunable direct wide bandgap and a large exciton binding energy of 60  meV at room temperature are very promising for solid-state LED applications [15, 16]. However, the main issue, the lack of high-quality and stable p-type doing of ZnO due to the strong <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effect</b> of native point defects such as zinc interstitial or oxygen vacancy, still remained. Thus, n-ZnO/p-GaN heterojunction LEDs are offered as an alternative approach due to the low lattice mismatch (1.9 %), similar bandgap energy between ZnO and GaN, and the same wurtzite crystal structure. Nevertheless, the spontaneous polarization of GaN [17 – 19] and the interfacial energy barrier between ZnO QDs and GaN will necessarily reduce the performance of the device, thus resulting the low EL efficiency of the device. To improve the EL efficiency of the LEDs, localized surface plasmon (LSP) has been introduced into n-ZnO/p-GaN LEDs to improve EL performance of the device. Recently, different metals like Au, Ag, and Pt have been observed to enhance the EL performance due to the enhancement of the internal quantum efficiency [20 – 26]. More recently, Lu et al. demonstrated a more than 30 -fold EL enhancement of Al nanoparticle-decorated n-ZnO nanorod/p-GaN LEDs compared with that of the bare one [27]. Liu et al. showed the devices of LSP-enhanced ZnO/SiO 2 core/shell nanorod array/p-GaN heterostructure LEDs containing decorated with Ag nanoparticles. In comparison with the bare UV LEDs, the maximum enhancement ration of the Ag nanoparticle-decorated LEDs in EL is sevenfold [28]. However, many reports are mainly focused on the LSP-enhanced LEDs based on ZnO nanorods; there has been no literature concerning the LSP-enhanced EL emission in ZnO QD-based LED structure.|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{and optical}} {{properties}} of the (N,Ga) -doped ZnO films have been studied. Three growth regions were identified to obtain ZnO films with different conduction types depending on the N/Ga flux ratio in doping process. The PL spectra show evident competition between neutral-donor bound exciton (D 0 X) and neutral-acceptor bound exciton (A 0 X) according to the N/Ga ratio. From the temperature-dependent PL spectra, the nitrogen acceptor level was identified to be about 126 meV in (N,Ga) -doped p-type ZnO. For nitrogen doping of ZnO thin films, DMHy {{was used as the}} nitrogen dopant source. A narrow temperature window from about 500 °C to 550 °C for efficient nitrogen doping was identified. However, p-type ZnO was not obtained by nitrogen mono-doping, which results from the low solubility of N and the self-compensating effect of native defects, and/or N-induced complexes. By co-doping N with Ga in proper ratios, p-type ZnO films were successfully achieved with a high hole concentration of 3. 51 x 1017 [...] 2. 41 x 1018 cm- 3, Hall mobility of 1. 1 [...] 4. 29 cm 2 /V-s and resistivity of 0. 6 [...] 16. 2 O cm. But the conduction type critically depends on the growth conditions. Based on the successfully fabrication of (N,Ga) -doped p-type ZnO, a p-ZnO:(N,Ga) /n-ZnO homojunction was fabricated. The I-V measurement shows clear rectifying behavior with a turn-on voltage of about 3. 7 V. Further investigation of the effect of N/Ga doping ratios on the conduction type of ZnO samples reveals that successful doping depends much on engineering a stable local chemical bonding environment. Under mono-doping conditions (via N-Zn 4), nitrogen solubility is limited and nitrogen acceptors are readily compensated by native donors and/or N-related donors; under appropriate N/Ga flux ratios, cluster-doping (via Ga-N 3 O and Ga-N 4) can be realized to achieve p-type ZnO; while excessively high N/Ga ratios cause the doped ZnO n-type conductivity again, which may be because that under excessively high N/Ga ratio range, N-Zn 4 configuration dominates and thus cause more N-related donors and degrade the ZnO film quality, similar as the mono-doping case. By tuning the N/Ga ratio in doping, it is expected to create appropriate chemical environments to enhance the formation of desired dopant species for stable p-type ZnO. In this work, Metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) growth of ZnO and its p-type doping have been studied. The group V element N was used as primary dopant to make ZnO p-type. In the growth of ZnO by MOCVD, {{it was found that the}} structural and morphological properties of deposited ZnO strongly depend on growth conditions. Low VI/II ratio and high growth rate favor the growth of ZnO nanostructures (nanowires, nanobelts); while high VI/II ratio and low growth rate favor the growth of ZnO thin films. The semiconductor ZnO is currently gaining intense interest in the research community because of its prospect in optoelectronic applications, such as blue/ultraviolet emitters and detectors, and high speed electronic devices. However, making reliable and reproducible p-type ZnO is still a bottleneck, which impedes the practical application of ZnO-based devices. The difficulty is mainly due to the <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effect</b> of native defects and the low solubility limit of acceptor dopants. Although substantial research is currently being carried out worldwide towards this goal, the effective p-type dopant and its doping process have not yet been identified. Wang, Hui. "Apr 2008.
