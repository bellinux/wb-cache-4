5|$|After the Grand Fleet was {{dissolved}} in early 1919, Thunderer was transferred {{back to the}} Home Fleet {{for a few months}} before she was assigned to the Reserve Fleet. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> converted into a training ship for naval cadets in 1921 and served in that role until she was sold for scrap in late 1926. While being towed to the scrapyard, Thunderer ran aground; the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> refloated and subsequently broken up.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the ceremonies, Nebraska remained in service with the Atlantic Fleet. In late 1909 she took part in the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in New York. The celebration saw an international fleet of warships from Germany, Britain, France, Italy, and other countries join the Atlantic Fleet to commemorate Henry Hudson's discovery of the Hudson River. In 1912, Nebraska took part in a ceremony for the centennial anniversary of Louisiana's entrance into the United States. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> deployed to Mexico twice to protect American interests during the Mexican Revolution, the first from 1 May to 21 June 1914, and the second from 1 June to 13 October 1916. For these actions, the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> awarded the Mexican Service Medal. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> briefly decommissioned in 1916, but returned to service on 3 April 1917.|$|E
5|$|After the war, she {{was sold}} to the South African Navy and renamed Pietermaritzburg. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> later {{converted}} into a midshipmans' training ship during the early 1960s. She served as a barracks ship from 1968 to 1991 when Pietermaritzburg was listed for disposal. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> scuttled as an artificial reef off the South African coast in 1994.|$|E
50|$|These <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{designed}} for a surface warfare role. Soviet priorities were changed to an anti-submarine role and only 4 <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> built with this configuration. These <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> followed by the , an anti-submarine derivative.|$|R
50|$|All <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{built in}} Kerch and were {{intended}} for the Soviet Coast Guard. Nowadays, 3 <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> in service with the Russian FSB Coast Guard and 1 <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> in service with the Ukrainian Navy.|$|R
50|$|Similar <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{built in}} Leningrad also. Leningrad-build <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{almost the same}} as Moscow-build ships, but their {{superstructure}} was little bit lower than on Moscow-build <b>ships.</b> The reason <b>was</b> that Leningrad had many low bridges. Leningrad-built <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> known as Leningradets-type ships, project 564K.|$|R
5|$|Amagis keel {{was laid}} down by Mitsubishi in Nagasaki, on 1 October 1942. She was {{launched}} on 15 October 1943 and completed on 10 August 1944. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> transferred {{among a number of}} ports on the Inland Sea until she arrived in Kure in February 1945 and was ordered to be camouflaged. Her intended air group, Air Group 601, was committed to the Battle of Iwo Jima about that same time. Amagi was briefly refitted from 10 to 24 February. On 19 March, the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> attacked by aircraft from Task Force 58 and lightly damaged by one bomb that struck the edge of the flight deck. On 13 April, the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> permanently moored at an island in Kure harbor and extensively camouflaged.|$|E
5|$|Andromeda {{returned}} home {{later that year}} and began a lengthy refit. She {{was assigned to the}} China Station in 1904 and {{returned home}} three years later. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> reduced to reserve at Chatham Dockyard upon her return, but transferred to Devonport Dockyard shortly afterwards. Andromeda was assigned to the 9th Cruiser Squadron of the new reserve Third Fleet in 1912. The following year the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> converted to a boys' training ship and renamed Powerful II on 23 September 1913. She was later renamed Impregnable II in November 1919 and finally, HMS Defiance on 20 January 1931, when she became part of the torpedo school. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> sold for scrap in 1956 and arrived at Burgt, Belgium, on 14 August to begin demolition.|$|E
5|$|As a carrier, the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> to {{have had}} a {{complement}} of ten Bf 109 fighters and ten Ju 87 dive-bombers. She would have been armed with an anti-aircraft battery of ten 10.5cm SK C/33 guns in dual mounts, ten 3.7cm SK C/30 guns in dual mounts, and twenty-four 2cm Flak 38 guns in quadruple mounts. Conversion work was halted in June 1943, however, and the incomplete vessel was towed to Königsberg where she was eventually scuttled on 29 January 1945. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> seized by the advancing Soviet Army and was briefly considered for cannibalization for spare parts to complete her sister ship Lützow, which had been purchased by the Soviet Navy before the war. This plan was also abandoned, and the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> broken up for scrap.|$|E
50|$|Originally sailing <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> used. Between 1880 and 1890, sailing <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{replaced}} by steamers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ships</b> <b>are</b> also {{considered}} units and can perform different tasks. Fishing ships can gather {{food in the}} form of fish, merchant <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> the nautical alternative to traders, and other <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> designed for naval battle or troop transport.|$|R
50|$|Barrack <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> common {{during the}} era of sailing ships when shore {{facilities}} were scarce or non-existent. Barrack <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> usually hulks. At times, barrack <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> also used as prison ships for convicts, prisoners of war or civilian internees.|$|R
5|$|Captain Maitland's {{account of}} the time Napoleon spent on board his <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} in 1826.|$|E
5|$|Design work on {{the ships}} was {{completed}} quickly in 1914. Brummer was laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin in early 1915. Work proceeded quickly, and the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> launched on 11 December 1915. After the completion of fitting-out work, the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 2 April 1916. Bremse followed her sister the same year at AG Vulcan. She was launched on 11 March 1916 and completed {{in less than four}} months; the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> commissioned into the fleet on 1 July 1916. During construction, the shape of their bow and its resemblance to British cruisers was covered by sheet metal.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> rearmed {{with light}} weapons and was {{converted}} into a blockship and was then modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets. Centurion {{was sent to the}} Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians quickly figured out the deception. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> deliberately sunk during the Invasion of Normandy in 1944 to form a breakwater.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ships</b> <b>were</b> {{sometimes}} camouflaged {{in classical}} times. Mediterranean pirate <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> sometimes painted blue-gray for concealment. Vegetius records that Julius Caesar's scout <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> painted bluish-green when gathering intelligence {{along the coast}} of Britain during the Gallic Wars. <b>Ships</b> <b>were</b> sometimes painted deceptively during the Age of Sail, while both sides in the American Civil War camouflaged their ships, whether to run blockades or for night reconnaissance.|$|R
50|$|The model <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> all at 1:25 scale. There <b>are</b> 11 <b>ships</b> and 4 tugs. All <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> {{equipped}} with indicators giving rudder angle, engine speed, ship speed, wind speed, etc. Most of the <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> {{equipped with}} {{bow and stern}} thrusters and anchors. Five <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> equipped with a DGPS tracking system. Training with special features like Becker rudder, Schilling rudder, CPP is available.|$|R
50|$|Initially four <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{planned to}} be ordered in 1959 to 1961. These <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> to be named Circe, Climene, Perseo and Polluce in honour of the World War II-era s of those names. These <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{postponed}} while the designs were updated and two <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> ordered in 1962. Both vessels were built by CNR in Riva Trigoso and named after types of soldiers and specifically after two World War II s.|$|R
5|$|During {{the evening}} of 15 November the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> tugged away by a Croatian fishing ship to the nearby Nečujam cove, where the vessel was beached to prevent her from sinking. In {{the early hours of}} the same day, the {{remaining}} JRM ships opened fire in retaliation for damaging Mukos. As Yugoslav forces left the area, the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> towed to an overhauling shipyard in Šibenik on the night of 17/18 November, after being salvaged by HRM divers with the help of Brodospas. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> repaired and renamed Šolta, entering service with the HRM on 15 May 1992 with Mile Tomas in command.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fall}} of 1919, George Washington carried another group of {{distinguished}} passengers—King Albert and Queen Elizabeth of Belgium and their party. Arriving New York 2 October, the royal couple paid a visit before returning to Brest 12 November. Subsequently, the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> decommissioned 28 November 1919 after having transported some 48,000 passengers to Europe and 34,000 back to the United States. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{turned over to the}} United States Shipping Board on 28 January 1920.|$|E
5|$|Gloucester was {{the eighth}} {{ship in the}} Royal Navy to be named after the eponymous port. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> laid down on 15 April 1909 by William Beardmore and Company at their Dalmuir {{shipyard}} and launched on 28 October. On being commissioned in October 1910, the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron of the Home Fleet. In January 1913, Gloucester {{was transferred to the}} 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron (LCS) in the Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|Ten P2-SE2-R1 <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{ordered by}} the Maritime Commission in World War II. The <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> laid down by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation in Alameda, California. The {{intended}} use of these ships after the War was for trans-Pacific service. As ordered, the <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> all named after U.S. Navy admirals. Only eight <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> completed as troop transports for the U.S. Navy, with the last two ships canceled on 16 December 1944. Despite being canceled, the last two <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> completed after the war to the P2-SE2-R3 design as civilian ships.|$|R
5000|$|Technical {{research}} <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{used by the}} United States Navy {{during the}} 1960s to gather intelligence by monitoring, recording and analyzing wireless electronic communications of nations {{in various parts of}} the world. At the time these <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> active, the mission of the <b>ships</b> <b>was</b> covert and discussion of the true mission was prohibited ("classified information"). The mission of the <b>ships</b> <b>was</b> publicly given as conducting research into atmospheric and communications phenomena. However, the true mission was more or less an open secret and the <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> commonly referred to as [...] "spy ships".|$|R
50|$|At {{total of}} 37 <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> built at Rybinsk. The last two <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> retired in 1992.|$|R
5|$|In her Navy career, Mercy made four transatlantic round {{trips to}} France, {{bringing}} home almost 2,000 wounded men. After {{the end of}} World War I, the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> based in Philadelphia, and briefly laid up there in 1924. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> decommissioned in 1934 and lent to the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, struck in 1938, and scrapped in 1939.|$|E
5|$|In late November 1943 the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{transferred}} by the WSA to the War Department {{for operation}} as a Hague Convention hospital ship by the U.S. Army. The ship {{put into the}} Todd Hoboken Shipyard at the Port of New York for conversion, remaining there until completion on 30 June 1944. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> initially assigned the name Poppy, under the then-current policy of naming Army hospital ships after flowers, but never operated under that name. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> instead named after First Lieutenant Blanche F. Sigman, a U.S. Army nurse killed in action on 7 February 1944 on the beachhead during Operation Shingle, the Allied landings at Anzio.|$|E
5|$|Inconstant, {{the fifth}} ship {{of her name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy, was laid down on 27 November 1866 at Pembroke Dockyard, Wales. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{launched}} on 25 March 1872 by Lady Muriel Campbell, daughter of John Campbell, 2nd Earl Cawdor. Inconstant was transferred to Portsmouth Dockyard to finish fitting out and was commissioned on 12 August 1869 by Captain Elphinstone D'Oyly D'Auvergne Aplin for duty with the Channel Squadron. He was relieved by Captain Charles Waddilove on 13 September 1870. The following year the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> assigned to the Detached Squadron, commanded by Rear-Admiral Frederick Seymour, which visited ports in Scandinavia after Inconstant joined them at Gibraltar, finally arriving at Spithead on 11 October 1871. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> paid off in 1872 and spent the next eight years in reserve.|$|E
50|$|All <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> steamers before 1961 and {{engines of}} all <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> modernized to liquid oil from 1961.|$|R

2500|$|The Visby {{class was}} a Swedish World War II {{destroyer}} class. During the years 1942–1944 four <b>ships,</b> , , [...] and , <b>were</b> built and {{delivered to the}} Swedish navy. The <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> [...] a part of Sweden's military buildup during the war. Under this period the <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> used as neutral guards and escort ships. In 1965 the <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> modified and rebuilt as frigates. Two of the <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> decommissioned in 1978 and the last two followed in 1982.|$|R
5|$|Laid {{down at the}} Thames Ironworks {{shipyard}} in London, England in 1865, the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> originally {{ordered by}} the Ottoman Empire as the Fatikh. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> built to a design created by the British naval architect Edward Reed. Before her launch, the Prussian Navy purchased the ship on 6 February 1867 and initially renamed it Wilhelm I. On 14 December 1867, the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> renamed again, as König Wilhelm. She was launched on 25 April 1868 and commissioned {{less than a year}} later, on 20 February 1869. The ship's first commander was Kapitän zur See Ludwig von Henk. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> the largest and most powerful vessel in the Prussian fleet, and served as its flagship. Indeed, König Wilhelm remained the largest German vessel until 1891. This was in part {{due to the fact that}} Germany laid down only one small ironclad between 1876 and 1888; the four s, launched in 1891 and 1892, were the first ships to surpass König Wilhelm in size.|$|E
5|$|Mahopac was recommissioned on 15 January 1866 {{and served}} on the East Coast. Renamed Castor on 15 June 1869, she resumed her {{original}} name on 10 August. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> placed in reserve on 11 March 1872 at Hampton Roads, but was recommissioned on 21 November 1873. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> based at Key West, Florida until 1876 when she was transferred to Port Royal, South Carolina. Mahopac was transferred to Norfolk, Virginia in July 1877 and then moored at Brandon, Virginia, and at City Point, before being placed in ordinary at Richmond from 1889 to 1895. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> transferred to League Island, Philadelphia in 1895. She was struck from the Navy List on 14 January 1902 and was sold on 25 March 1902.|$|E
5|$|Orizaba made15 transatlantic voyages for the Navy {{carrying}} {{troops to}} and from Europe in World War I with the second-shortest average in-port turnaround time of all Navy transports. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{turned over to the}} War Department in 1919for use as Army transport USAT Orizaba. After her World War I service ended, Orizaba reverted to the Ward Line, her previous owners. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> briefly engaged in transatlantic service to Spain and then engaged in New York–Cuba–Mexico service until 1939, when the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> chartered to United States Lines. While Orizaba was in her Ward Line service, American poet Hart Crane leapt to his death from the rear deck of the liner off Florida in April 1932.|$|E
