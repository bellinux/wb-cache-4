30|$|With the TOSC, {{in order}} to obtain the optimal {{throughput}} region, the scheduling decision maximizes the weighted sum of queue lengths and continues to transmit new packets regardless of whether there are old packets queueing at the RS. Multiple packets queueing at the RS causes a packet re-ordering problem and may introduce a <b>significant</b> <b>instant</b> delay at the MS. This effect may be harmful for the real-time applications, e.g., video streaming. We design a scheduling policy that allows only one packet of each flow to be buffered at the RS. This policy guarantees that there is no effect of packet re-ordering. The complexity of the policy is identical to that of TOSC due to the similarity in computation of the link weights. We refer to this policy as TOSC-wo.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} {{for the investigation}} of the space-time relations between public services and individual mobility, by checking the space-time efficiency of the allocation of public and private parking areas. The methodology has been applied to the case study of Brescia, in northern Italy. The spatial distribution of car parking has been assessed as well as the usage variations during the day. First of all, the location and the density of parking areas within the city has been taken into account, and represented to show the spatial coverage of car parking supply. Then, the temporal issue has been considered, since the degree of use of each parking area varies within the time of the day. Therefore, the degree of use of each parking area has been mapped at three <b>significant</b> <b>instant</b> of the day (10. 00 a. m.; 01. 00 p. m. and 04. 00 p. m.). This kind of analysis is particularly helpful to highlight the availability of parking areas during the day. The results of the analysis, even if referred to a case study, can be extended to similar situations as the methodology of the analysis has a broaden sound meaning. The aim of the paper is to illustrate a method to develop mobility policies and plans...|$|E

Moreover, behind the formality of this calendrically <b>significant</b> <b>instant,</b> there is also our timeless expression of great affection and thanks to Sergio: affection for his sympathetic character and thanks for his activities in our profession, both within the scientific framework and in the broader social context. But {{for those of us}} from MIT there is a special feeling of gratitude towards Sergio, and that is because in the late sixties and early seventies he was with us and helped shape what can now be seen as the most recent golden age of physics, thereby establishing at MIT a tradition that still flourishes today. You have to appreciate the moment: Steven Weinberg was on the faculty completing the standard model, while Garbriele Veneziano and Sergio were inventing what proved to be the physics of the future — string theory. These people have since departed from our University, but Sergio has kept the legacy vital by visiting us — not as frequently as we would have liked — and by encouraging continuing contact with his wonderful and talented Italian compatriot physicists. The people who came from Italy to enrich our department are too numerous to list, but theirs is an ongoing presence, formalized recently by an agreement with the INFN, and the well-spring of all this good fortune is Sergio Fubini, whom we all thank. Sergio is now gone from MIT, but I am certain he wants to be informed of activity there, so I shall describe one project, with the hope that it meets his criteria of simplicity and symmetry. These days, as high energy particle colliders become unavailable for testing speculative theoretical ideas, physicists are looking to other environments that may provide extreme conditions where theory confronts physical reality. One such circumstance may arise at high temperature T, which perhaps can be attained in heavy ion collisions or in astrophysical settings.

40|$|Synchronization {{means the}} {{aligning}} of the <b>significant</b> <b>instants</b> of one {{signal to the}} <b>significant</b> <b>instants</b> of another. In digital systems, where timing transfer between systems is required, synchronization is an important function. In this thesis new results on the performance and design of synchronization processes are presented. An inescapable consequence of the synchronization of external autonomous inputs in digital systems {{is the possibility of}} failure of digital devices used to capture the external signal. The anomalous behaviour of these devices is referred to as metastability. The most commonly used approach to controlling the problem of metastability is the use of synchronizers. A synchronizer can be designed to reduce the probability of metastable: failure but cannot eliminate it altogether. New high performance synchronizer designs are presented and analysed in this thesis. Another consequence of synchronization is the resulting disturbance of the significant epochs of timing signals. This disturbance is referred to as jitter. The characterization of jitter produced in synchronization processes is important in the design of digital systems. In this thesis, jitter characteristics are derived for two important applications that arise in digital communications systems. The characterization provides new insight into the dependence of the jitter on system parameters...|$|R

According to ITU-T standards, a pair of signals are plesiochronous if their <b>significant</b> <b>instants</b> occur at nominally the same rate, with any variation in rate being constrained within specified limits. A sender and receiver operate plesiosynchronously if they operate at the same nominal frequency but may have a slight frequency mismatch, which leads to a drifting phase.

The time evolution of this interference image carries {{information about the}} ensemble-averaged dynamics of the scatterer particles. The aim of this work was {{to evaluate the use}} of dynamic speckles as an alternative tool to monitoring frozen foams formulated with glucose and fructose syrups. Ice creams, after preparation and packing, were stored at 18 degrees C. Changes in properties of products were analyzed by speckle phenomena at three room temperatures (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C), minute by minute, during 50 min. Two moments were identified in which samples activity achieved <b>significant</b> levels. These <b>instants</b> were associated, respectively, to ice crystals melting and to air bubbles dissipation into the food matrix causing motion of diverse structures.

40|$|Low Glycemic Index (GI) food {{products}} could become good choices for diabetic patients or {{people at risk}} of developing diabetes type 2. Arrowroot tuber (Maranta arundinacea) is a local tuber that has lower GI (8 - 32). Glycemic Index strongly related with starch digestibility. Amylose and resistant starch are two factors that influence starch digestion. Higher amylose and resistant starch, related with crystalline form of starch, can lower starch digestion. Processing arrowroot into instant starch or flour with low starchy digestion can be a proper choice. Drying using high temperature {{is known to be}} able to increase amylose, resistant starch and reduce the starch digestibility. This researh aim was to evaluate the effect of the drying temperatures (80 °C, 90 °C and 100 °C) on the amylose, resistant starch, and in vitro starch digestibility of instant arrowroot flour and starch. The analysis done were amylose, resistant starch and in vitro starch digestibility analysis. The higher the drying temperatures, resulted higher amylose content in instant starch and flour (Δamylose up to 34 %). For resistant starch analysis, the result showed that there was no <b>significant</b> difference between <b>instant</b> arrowroot starch and flour, also among the drying temperatures. Native starch and flour had the highest content of resistant starch. In vitro starch digestibility showed the highest glucose and starch released at the 120 minute, while at the 150 minute the glucose and starch release started to decrease.

40|$|Ozone (O 3) {{measurements}} are {{a critical component}} of air quality management and many atmospheric chemistry laboratory experiments. Conventional ozone monitoring devices based on UV absorption are relatively cumbersome and expensive, and have a relative high power consumption that limits their use to fixed sites. In this study electrochemical O 3 sensors (OXB 421, Alphasense) were used in a miniaturised O 3 measurement device combined with LabJack and Labview data acquisition (DAQ). The device required a power supply of 5  V direct current (VDC) with a total power consumption of approximately 5  W. Total weight was less than 0. 5  kg, low enough for portable in situ field deployment. The electrochemical O 3 sensors produced a voltage signal positively proportional to O 3 concentrations over the range of 5  ppb– 10  ppm. There was excellent agreement between the performances of two O 3 sensors with a good linear coefficient (R 2  =  0. 9995). The influences of relative humidity (RH) and gas sample flow rate on sensor calibrations and sensitivities have been investigated separately. Coincident calibration curves indicate that sensor performances were almost identical even at different RHs and flow rates after a re-zeroing process to offset the sensor baseline drifts. Rapid RH changes (∼ 20 %/min) generate <b>significant</b> and <b>instant</b> changes in sensor signal, and the sensors consistently take up to 40  min to recover their original values after such a rapid RH change. In contrast, slow RH changes (∼ 0. 1 %/min) had little effect on sensor response. To test the performance of the miniaturised O 3 device for real-world applications, the O 3 sensors were employed for (i) laboratory experiments to measure O 3 loss by seawater uptake and (ii) air quality monitoring over an 18 -day period. It was found that ozone uptake by seawater was linear to the volume of linoleic acid on a sea surface microlayer and the calculated uptake coefficients based on sensor measurements were close to those from previous studies. For the 18 -day period of air quality monitoring the corrected data from the O 3 sensor was in a good agreement with those obtained by reference UV O 3 analyser with an r 2 of 0. 83 (n =  8502). The novelty {{of this study is that}} the electrochemical O 3 sensor was comprehensively investigated in O 3 measurements in both laboratory and ambient air quality monitoring and it can to be a miniaturised alternative for conventional O 3 monitoring devices due to its low cost, low power-consumption, portable and simple-conduction properties...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Edentulism often {{involves}} functional, esthetic, phonetic and psychological problems. Objectives: To evaluate patient-centered outcomes of full-arch screw-retained rehabilitation on immediately loaded implants. Material and methods: Fifty patients treated with Astra Tech((TM)) implants answered self-administered questionnaires on a visual analogue scale (VAS) 100 mm scale or with multiple-choice or open questions: at baseline, 1 week, 3 or 6 months and 1 year. Changes of VAS in time {{were analyzed using}} mixed models for repeated measures, adjusting for gender, age and jaw; comparison of cross-sectional parameters between jaws was performed with the Mann-Whitney U- or chi(2) -test, all at the 0. 05 significance level. Results: The median calculated general satisfaction score increased from 40. 25 (mean= 40. 9; SD= 23. 82; range= 0 - 95) at baseline to 98. 25 (mean= 95. 3; SD= 6. 68; range= 74 - 100) after 1 year. Overall comfort, eating comfort, speaking comfort and perceived esthetics improved significantly within 1 week after surgery and immediate provisionalization. This did not change significantly until the final bridge was installed after 3 months (mandible) or 6 months (maxilla), when a further significant improvement was demonstrated. The most common postoperative complication was swelling, especially in the maxilla. The importance of one-stage surgery and immediate loading was rated very high by patients before treatment, especially in the mandible. The main reason for choosing fixed prosthetics was eating comfort. Phonetics and esthetics were {{more important in the}} maxilla than in the mandible. Conclusion: Immediate full-arch rehabilitation yeilds an <b>instant</b> <b>significant</b> improvement in general patient satisfaction and self-perceived factors related to comfort, function and esthetics.
