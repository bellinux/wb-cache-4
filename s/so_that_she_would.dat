5|$|Due to time constraints, some {{plot points}} of Asellus story were removed. During those events, Asellus was {{supposed}} to visit Dr. Nusakan's clinic, Bio Research Lab, Lambda Base, and Furdo's Workshop <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> find her true identity <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> decide to live {{as a human being}} or as a mystic. These quests were also intended to affect her scenario's ending.|$|E
5|$|The hull of {{the ship}} was steel, and the {{woodwork}} teak, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be fit for tropical environments. She was outfitted with six quick firing guns, six three pounder guns, and four five barreled guns. The ship's internal spaces had electric lights.|$|E
5|$|To help {{publicize}} the production, Ince {{reported to the}} newspapers that lead-actress Tsuru Aoki {{was a native of}} the island of Sakura and she had lost all her relatives in the eruption—she was actually from Obara Tsuru city, Kyushu, 180 miles north of Sakura-Jima. Ince also embroidered her biography <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> appeal to the middle-class audiences as the heroine of a melodrama, claiming that she was the daughter of an illustrious Japanese artist. The biographical-type publicity added emotional and psychological authenticity to the character that Aoki played in the film.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of World War I, Helgoland was {{assigned}} to the I Division, I Battle Squadron. Helgoland was stationed off the heavily fortified island of Wangerooge on 9 August. Minefields and picket lines of cruisers, torpedo boats, and submarines were also emplaced there to defend Wilhelmshaven. Helgolands engines were kept running for the entirety of her deployment, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be ready to respond at a moment's notice. Four days later, on 13 August, Helgoland returned to Wilhelmshaven to refuel. The following day, naval reservists began arriving to fill out the wartime complements for the German battleships.|$|E
5|$|Daksinakaali is {{typically}} shown {{with her right}} foot on Shiva's chest—while depictions showing Kaali with her left foot on Shiva's chest depict the even more fearsome Vamakaali. The pose shows the conclusion of an episode in which Kaali was rampaging out of control after destroying many demons. Shiva, fearing that Kaali would not stop until she destroyed the world, could only think of one way to pacify her. He {{lay down on the}} battlefield <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have to step on him. Seeing her consort under her foot, Kaali realized that she had gone too far, and calmed down. In some interpretations of the story, Shiva was attempting to receive Kaali's grace by receiving her foot on his chest.|$|E
5|$|Disney had {{originally}} conceived Mulan as an oppressed young Chinese woman who ultimately elopes to Europe {{to be with}} a British prince. However, director Tony Bancroft, who was inspired by the well-being of his own daughters, wanted Mulan to be a different, unique kind of Disney heroine – one who is strong and independent, whose fate does not depend upon a male character. Thus, the relationship between Mulan and Captain Li Shang was relegated to that of a minor subplot, while Mulan's bravery and strength were emphasized {{in order to ensure that}} she remained the hero of her own story. Mulan's supervising animator was Mark Henn, who deliberately designed the character <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> appear less feminine than her predecessors.|$|E
25|$|Empress Dowager Cixi (late 19th century) enjoyed celebrating Mid-Autumn Festival <b>so</b> much <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{spend the}} period between the thirteenth and seventeenth day of the eighth month staging {{elaborate}} rituals.|$|R

5|$|Hindley was not arrested with Brady, but {{she demanded}} {{to go with}} him to the police station, {{accompanied}} by her dog, Puppet, to which the police agreed. Hindley was questioned about the events surrounding Evans's death, but she refused to make any statement beyond claiming that it had been an accident. As the police had no evidence that Hindley was involved in Evans's murder, she was allowed to go home, on the condition that she return the next day for further questioning. Hindley was at liberty for four days following Brady's arrest, during which time she went to her employer's premises and asked to be dismissed, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be eligible for unemployment benefits. While in the office where Brady worked, she found some papers belonging to him in an envelope that she claimed she did not open, which she burned in an ashtray. She believed that they were plans for bank robberies, {{nothing to do with the}} murders. On 11 October, Hindley was charged as an accessory to the murder of Edward Evans and was remanded at Risley.|$|E

Veronica learns that the baby's foster mother committed suicide {{and her father}} was in jail, hinting that the baby is Trina Echolls. Veronica talks to Trina and tells her the news of her parentage. Trina actually wants her story {{to go to the}} tabloids. However, a deaf lunch lady storms in and says that she's actually Trina's mother. The lunch lady says that Lianne was a friend who covered up her pregnancy to protect her. Trina's father is Principal Moorehead, and Trina confronts him about leaving her at the prom in front of many faculty. Veronica finds the dead rat that Keith picked up at the bus. Veronica finds out that Principal Clemmons deliberately gave Veronica her detention task <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> find her mother's permanent file and frame Principal Moorehead. Veronica picks up Abel Koontz's (Christian Clemenson) belongings and walks into Meg's (Alona Tal) room and discovers that Meg is pregnant.|$|E

At Wesley's office, she meets an airline pilot named Carol (Matt Damon). When she learns that Carol is a big fan of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS), for which Liz is the head writer, she asks Carol to go with her to Cerie's wedding, which he accepts. At Cerie's wedding, Wesley is distraught that Liz ended their engagement through a text message she sent to him. Liz tells him that fate brought them together <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> meet Carol, with whom she can see herself spending the rest of her life. Wesley is devastated and leaves. Unbeknownst to Liz, Carol, who Liz thought had stepped out from the party area, heard everything she told Wesley, which shocks Carol, prompting him to leave.

5|$|In a {{prototype}} from the series, Alphonse's soul was sealed in a flying squirrel instead of armor {{as a result}} of human transmutation. He appeared as the father to the other protagonist, Edward, in their searching for a way to recover their bodies. To match the designs from the manga magazine Monthly Shōnen Gangan, the two characters were redesigned. Alphonse was given a huge suit of armor to contrast him with Edward's short stature. Since Alphonse mostly appears with his armor, Arakawa tends to make sketches of his human form <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not forget how to draw him. Some events from the Elrics' lives are social problems she integrated into the plot. Their journey across the country to help people is meant to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. As Alphonse is mostly seen with his armor, during various chapters from the manga Arakawa was unable to draw him crying. During Chapter 40, Arakawa saw his conversation with Edward as a way to let him express his feeling and to make him appear as though he is crying. When comparing the two brothers during the time Alphonse obtained the ability to use alchemy without a circle like Edward, Arakawa stated nobody was better at alchemy as the two had different preferences {{in the same way as}} other alchemists appearing in the series. When making omakes, Arakawa tends to draw Alphonse doing something comical to contrast him with the other characters. She states that she does it because Alphonse may enjoy making fun of other people.|$|E
5|$|The Creator, after {{creating}} Aquaria, {{created a}} series of civilizations, making a new one in turn when each one was destroyed. The Creator kidnaps Li, with whom Naija has fallen in love, and she attacks the Creator to get him back. The player defeats the god as the final boss of the game, and returns home with Li. In the epilogue, Naija is shown with Li and their child. If the player has found all of Naija's memories by discovering places she remembers, they reveal that the shadowy figure {{at the beginning of}} the game was her mother, Mia. Mia was made by the Creator and had the ability, like Naija, to use the different powers of all of the civilizations. She fled the Creator, and hid herself and Naija among several communities in succession; after the destruction of the last one she erased Naija's memory <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> find out the history of Aquaria on her own and defeat the Creator. In the extended epilogue shown if the player has found all of the memories, Mia appears, telling Naija that the two of them can conquer the civilisations above the water. After Naija refuses, Mia kidnaps her, and vanishes; the extended epilogue ends with Lucien, Naija and Li's son, leaving to find her. If the player has not found all of the memories, the epilogue instead ends with Naija asking the player to find out about her past, and revealing that the narration of the game was intended to be heard by her son.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Nesbit, as {{she lost}} her power of self-command and her cleverness, without parting with her {{bitterness}} of spirit, had pitiably grown worse and worse, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> where <b>she</b> <b>would</b> once have been courteously sarcastic, she was now positively insolent.|$|R
50|$|Celia's {{love for}} Rosalind knows no limits and is {{frequently}} {{referred to in}} the play.

25|$|After {{qualifying}} to {{the final}} Storeng {{was asked by the}} Norwegian delegation to cancel all activities and to not speak until the final, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be able to give the best performance she could {{on the night of the}} final.|$|E
25|$|Cooper counter-sued on March 30, 1972, {{demanding}} $15.4 {{million in}} damages for the ongoing harassment. However, the church stepped up the harassment, for instance painting her name and phone number on street walls <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> receive obscene phone calls, and subscribing her to pornographic mailing lists. She also received anonymous death threats and her neighbors received letters claiming {{that she had a}} venereal disease.|$|E
25|$|In later stories, Lamia was cursed {{with the}} {{inability}} to close her eyes <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> always obsess over {{the image of her}} dead children. Some accounts (see Horace, below) say Hera forced Lamia to devour her own children. Myths variously describe Lamia's monstrous (occasionally serpentine) appearance as a result of either Hera's wrath, the pain of grief, the madness that drove her to murder, or—in some rare versions—a natural result of being Hecate's daughter.|$|E
60|$|This {{consolation}} seldom {{failed to}} gladden her, but her disappointment was <b>so</b> sharp to-day <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not even look up.|$|R

25|$|Lamia was a {{queen of}} Libya, whom Zeus loved. Hera turned {{her into a}} monster and murdered their {{children}}. Or, alternatively, she killed Lamia's children and the grief turned her into a monster. Lamia was cursed with the inability to close her eyes <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> always obsess over {{the image of her}} dead children. Zeus gave her the gift {{to be able to take}} her eyes out to rest, and then put them back in. Lamia was envious of other mothers and ate their children.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, she {{accepted}} a faculty position at University of California, Berkeley as a Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{be closer to}} family and the synchrotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. This initial work to solve large RNA structures led to further structural studies on the HDV ribozyme, the IRES, and protein-RNA complexes like the Signal recognition particle. Her lab now focuses on obtaining a mechanistic understanding of biological processes involving RNA. This work is divided over three major areas, the CRISPR system, RNA interference, and translational control via MicroRNAs.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{creative}} team {{did not want}} the X-Men to have an all-male lineup, editor Roy Thomas suggested that Cockrum make his character Typhoon, originally designed as a male, into the woman of the group. Cockrum liked the idea, and outfitted Typhoon with The Black Cat's costume, a cape, and a new haircut with white hair. His collaborators feared that Storm’s white hair would make her look like a grandmother, but Cockrum, confident that he could consistently draw the character <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> appear young, insisted on this aspect of her appearance.|$|E

She gets worked up easily and is deeply envious of Chihaya.|$|R
