2500|$|Korean has a <b>simple</b> <b>tone</b> system often {{characterized}} by the poorly defined term [...] "pitch accent". Hangul originally had two diacritics to represent this system, a single tick, as in 성〮, for high tone, and a double tick, as in 성〯, for a long vowel. When transcribing Chinese, these had been used for the 'departing' (去聲) and 'rising' (上聲) tones, respectively. [...] (The 'even' tone (平聲) was not marked. [...] The 'entering' (入聲) [...] "tone", which was not a tone at all, was indicated by its final stop consonant.) [...] Although the pitch and length distinctions are still made in speech by many Koreans, the diacritics are obsolete.|$|E

60|$|The {{comparison}} of Turner with Cuyp and Claude may sound strange in most ears; {{but this is}} chiefly {{because we are not}} in the habit of analyzing and dwelling upon those difficult and daring passages of the modern master which do not at first appeal to our ordinary notions of truth, owing to his habit of uniting two, three, or even more separate tones in the same composition. In this also he strictly follows nature, for wherever climate changes, tone changes, and the climate changes with every 200 feet of elevation, so that the upper clouds are always different in tone from the lower ones, these {{from the rest of the}} landscape, and in all probability, some part of the horizon from the rest. And when nature allows this in a high degree, as in her most gorgeous effects she always will, she does not herself impress at once with intensity of tone, as in the deep and quiet yellows of a July evening, but rather with the magnificence and variety of associated color, in which, if we give time and attention to it, we shall gradually find the solemnity and the depth of twenty tones instead of one. Now in Turner's power of associating cold with warm light, no one has ever approached, or even ventured into the same field with him. The old masters, content with one <b>simple</b> <b>tone,</b> sacrificed to its unity all the exquisite gradations and varied touches of relief and change by which nature unites her hours with each other. They gave the warmth of the sinking sun, overwhelming all things in its gold; but they did not give those gray passages about the horizon where, seen through its dying light, the cool and the gloom of night gather themselves for their victory. Whether it was in them impotence or judgment, it is not for me to decide. I have only to point to the daring of Turner in this respect, as something to which art affords no matter of comparison, as that in which the mere attempt is, in itself, superiority. Take the evening effect with the Temeraire. That picture will not, at the first glance, deceive as a piece of actual sunlight; but this is because there is in it more than sunlight, because under the blazing veil of vaulted fire which lights the vessel on her last path, there is a blue, deep, desolate hollow of darkness, out of which you can hear the voice of the night wind, and the dull boom of the disturbed sea; because the cold, deadly shadows of the twilight are gathering through every sunbeam, and moment by moment as you look, you will fancy some new film and faintness of the night has risen over the vastness of the departing form.|$|E

50|$|Aside from {{pitch and}} loudness, another quality that distinguishes sound stimuli is timbre. Timbre {{allows us to}} hear the {{difference}} between two instruments that are playing at the same frequency and loudness, for example. When two <b>simple</b> <b>tones</b> are put together they create a complex <b>tone.</b> The <b>simple</b> <b>tones</b> of an instrument are called harmonics or overtones. Timbre is created by putting the harmonics together with the fundamental frequency (a sound's basic pitch). When a complex sound is heard, it causes different parts in the basilar membrane to become simultaneously stimulated and flex. In this way, {{we are able to}} distinguish different timbres.|$|R

40|$|Persons with Autism {{spectrum}} disorders (ASD) display atypical perceptual processing {{in visual}} and auditory tasks. In vision, Bertone, Mottron, Jelenic, and Faubert (2005) found that enhanced and diminished visual processing {{is linked to}} the level of neural complexity required to process stimuli, as proposed in the neural complexity hypothesis. Based on these findings, Samson, Mottron, Jemel, Belin, and Ciocca (2006) proposed to extend the neural complexity hypothesis to the auditory modality. They hypothesized that persons with ASD should display enhanced performance for <b>simple</b> <b>tones</b> that are processed in primary auditory cortical regions, but diminished performance for complex tones that require additional processing in associative auditory regions, in comparison to typically developing individuals. To assess this hypothesis, we designed four auditory discrimination experiments targeting pitch, non-vocal and vocal timbre, and loudness. Stimuli consisted of spectro-temporally <b>simple</b> and complex <b>tones.</b> The participants were adolescents and young adults with autism, Asperger syndrome, and typical developmental histories, all with IQs in the normal range. Consistent with the neural complexity hypothesis and enhanced perceptual functioning model of ASD (Mottron, Dawson, Soulières, Hubert, & Burack, 2006), the participants with autism, but not with Asperger syndrome, displayed enhanced pitch discrimination for <b>simple</b> <b>tones.</b> [ [...] . ...|$|R
50|$|The Lithuanian {{prosodic}} {{system is}} characterized by free accent and distinctive quantity. Its accentuation is sometimes described as a <b>simple</b> <b>tone</b> system, often called pitch accent. In lexical words, one syllable will be tonically prominent. A heavy syllable—that is, a syllable containing a long vowel, diphthong, or a sonorant coda—may have one of two tones, falling tone (or acute tone) or rising tone (or circumflex tone). Light syllables (syllables with short vowels and optionally also obstruent codas) {{do not have the}} two-way contrast of heavy syllables.|$|E
50|$|Languages with <b>simple</b> <b>tone</b> {{systems or}} pitch accent may {{have one or}} two syllables {{specified}} for tone, {{with the rest of the}} word taking a default tone. Such languages differ in which tone is marked and which is the default. In Navajo, for example, syllables have a low tone by default, whereas marked syllables have high tone. In the related language Sekani, however, the default is high tone, and marked syllables have low tone. There are parallels with stress: English stressed syllables have a higher pitch than unstressed syllables, whereas in Russian, stressed syllables have a lower pitch.|$|E
50|$|The sarabande {{is based}} on a theme-and-{{variation}} pattern. The theme itself is again a variation of Dies irae. In the first few bars, the theme is played with pizzicato, making it sound as if played by guitar or lute. The movement consists of six variations, and each variation develops gradually to the end. In the first variation, for example, Ysaÿe instructs the player not to use vibrato, in order to maintain a <b>simple</b> <b>tone.</b> The last variation is composed of technically demanding thirty-second notes, all played forte. Then, the theme is repeated, but this time, it is played with the bow.|$|E
50|$|Outside {{of larger}} city {{areas such as}} Damascus, Aleppo or Homs, {{residential}} areas are often clustered in smaller villages. The buildings themselves are often quite old (perhaps a few hundred years old), passed down to family members over several generations. Residential construction of rough concrete and blockwork is usually unpainted, and the palette of a Syrian village is therefore <b>simple</b> <b>tones</b> of grays and browns.|$|R
5000|$|The law was {{proposed}} by physicist Georg Ohm in 1843.

[...] Helmholtz championed the law in opposition to contrary evidence expounded by August Seebeck.|$|R
40|$|Frequency modulations {{occur in}} many natural sounds, {{including}} vocalizations. The neuronal response to frequency modulated (FM) stimuli {{has been studied}} extensively in different brain areas, {{with an emphasis on}} the auditory cortex and the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus. Here, we measured the responses to FM sweeps in whole-cell recordings from neurons in the dorsal cortex of the mouse inferior colliculus. Both up- and downward logarithmic FM sweeps were presented at two different speeds to both the ipsi- and the contralateral ear. Based on the number of action potentials that were fired, between 10 - 24 % of cells were selective for rate or direction of the FM sweeps. A somewhat lower percentage of cells, 6 - 21 %, showed selectivity based on EPSP size. To study the mechanisms underlying the generation of FM selectivity, we compared FM responses with responses to <b>simple</b> <b>tones</b> in the same cells. We found that if pairs of neurons responded in a similar way to <b>simple</b> <b>tones,</b> they generally also responded in a similar way to FM sweeps. Further evidence that FM selectivity can be generated within the dorsal cortex was obtained by reconstructing FM sweeps from the response to <b>simple</b> <b>tones</b> using three different models. In about half of the direction selective neurons the selectivity was generated by spectrally asymmetric synaptic inhibition. In addition, evidence for direction selectivity based on the timing of excitatory responses was also obtained in some cells. No clear evidence for the local generation of rate selectivity was obtained. We conclude that FM direction selectivity can be generated within the dorsal cortex of the mouse inferior colliculus by multiple mechanisms...|$|R
