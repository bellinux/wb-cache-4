5|$|Of all the horrid abominations {{with which}} London has been cursed, {{there is not}} one that can come up to that disgusting place, West Smithfield Market, for cruelty, filth, effluvia, pestilence, impiety, horrid language, danger, disgusting and shuddering <b>sights,</b> <b>and</b> every obnoxious item that can be imagined; and this abomination is {{suffered}} to continue year after year, from generation to generation, in {{the very heart of the}} most Christian and most polished city in the world.|$|E
5|$|The F-105 was {{designed}} primarily for low-level interdiction and its low-altitude speed was its greatest asset {{when dealing with}} enemy fighters such as the MiG-17/J-5s and MiG-21. The F-105 managed 27.5 air-to-air victories. Based on combat experience, the F-105D was updated with a better ejection seat, additional armor, improved gun <b>sights,</b> <b>and</b> Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) pods on the wings.|$|E

60|$|WISE. You say well, and I {{will add}} {{a word or}} two more to what I have said. Repentance, as it is not {{produced}} without a <b>sight</b> <b>and</b> sense of sin, so every <b>sight</b> <b>and</b> sense of sin cannot produce it; I mean every <b>sight</b> <b>and</b> sense of sin cannot produce that repentance, that is repentance unto salvation; repentance never to be repented of. For it is yet fresh before us, that Mr. Badman had a <b>sight</b> <b>and</b> sense of sin, in that fit of sickness that he had before, but it died without procuring any such godly fruit; as was manifest by his so soon returning with the dog to his vomit. Many people think also that repentance stands in confession of sin only, but they are very much mistaken; for repentance, as was said before, is a being sorry for, and returning from transgression to God by Jesus Christ. Now, if this be true, that every <b>sight</b> <b>and</b> sense of sin will not produce repentance, then repentance cannot be produced there where there is no <b>sight</b> <b>and</b> sense of sin. That every <b>sight</b> <b>and</b> sense of sin will not produce repentance, to wit, the godly repentance that we are speaking of, is manifest in Cain, Pharaoh, Saul, and Judas, who all of them had sense, great sense of sin, but none of them repentance unto life.|$|R

5|$|The Mk. XIV was {{theoretically}} less {{accurate than}} the contemporary Norden bombsight but was smaller, easier to use, faster-acting and {{better suited to}} night bombing. It equipped {{the majority of the}} RAF bomber fleet during the war; small numbers of Stabilized Automatic Bomb <b>Sights</b> <b>and</b> Low Level Bombsight, Mark IIIs were used in specialist roles. A post-war upgrade, the T-4, also known by its rainbow code Blue Devil, connected directly to the Navigation and Bombing System to automate the setting of windspeed and direction and further increase accuracy. These equipped the V Bomber force as well as other aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{has three}} eleven-line stanzas which {{describe}} a progression through the season, {{from the late}} maturation of the crops to the harvest and to {{the last days of}} autumn when winter is nearing. The imagery is richly achieved through the personification of Autumn, and the description of its bounty, its <b>sights</b> <b>and</b> sounds. It has parallels in the work of English landscape artists, with Keats himself describing the fields of stubble that he saw on his walk as being like that in a painting.|$|E
5|$|The retreat quickly {{broke down}} into a {{confused}} and disorganized rout. Task Force Smith suffered its highest casualties during this withdrawal as its soldiers were most exposed to enemy fire. The surviving members of Task Force Smith reached Battery A's position. The artillerymen disabled the five remaining howitzers by removing their <b>sights</b> <b>and</b> breechblocks and retired in good order with {{the remains of the}} task force on foot to the northern outskirts of Osan, where most of the unit's hidden transport vehicles were found intact. The vehicles, unmolested by the North Korean forces, departed for Pyongtaek and Cheonan, picking up stragglers along the way, eventually joining units of the 24th Infantry Division that had established a second line of defense.|$|E
50|$|In 1991 The Monthly Film Bulletin was {{merged with}} <b>Sight</b> <b>and</b> Sound, which had until then been {{published}} quarterly - <b>Sight</b> <b>and</b> Sound {{then became a}} monthly publication and took up The Monthly Film Bulletins remit to review all films released in the UK.|$|R
50|$|When DSM {{acquired}} Roche’s Fine Chemicals division, Roche Vitamins, in 2003, {{the company}} continued the <b>Sight</b> <b>and</b> Life Initiative and Newsletter (which it repackaged as the <b>Sight</b> <b>and</b> Life Magazine), and broadened the Initiative’s focus to addressing {{a wider range}} of micronutrient deficiencies, not just vitamin A deficiency. This broader focus is reflected in <b>Sight</b> <b>and</b> Life’s current programming and grantmaking policies as well as the Magazine’s editorial content. <b>Sight</b> <b>and</b> Life is also active in promoting greater awareness of the problems of nutritional anemia (or iron deficiency anemia), and the ‘double burden of malnutrition,’ an emergent phenomenon in settings of nutritional transition in which both malnutrition and over-nutrition (e.g. obesity), and the diseases associated with them, are found in the same population.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sight</b> <b>and</b> Life {{was founded}} in 1986 by the Swiss global health-care company, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd. As a {{humanitarian}} initiative of Roche, <b>Sight</b> <b>and</b> Life focused on providing assistance {{to address the problem}} of vitamin A deficiency in developing countries. This assistance was provided mostly in the form of free vitamin A capsules to vitamin A supplementation projects and grants or scholarships for health-care professionals in developing countries to attend international conferences, workshops, and courses or academic programs. Other types of support included grants for small-scale projects and/or programmatic research. <b>Sight</b> <b>and</b> Life also began publishing the <b>Sight</b> <b>and</b> Life Newsletter, which disseminated news from the projects and research it supported as well as general news and specific features relating to vitamin A.|$|R
5|$|Downloadable content (DLC) for {{the game}} was {{released}} following its launch. The game's Season Pass includes access to all DLC, {{as well as some}} additional abilities, and the documentary Grounded: Making The Last of Us; the documentary was released online in February 2014. Two DLC packs were included with some of the game's special editions and were available upon release. The <b>Sights</b> <b>and</b> Sounds Pack included the soundtrack, a dynamic theme for the PlayStation 3 home screen, and two avatars. The Survival Pack featured bonus skins for the player following the completion of the campaign, and in-game money, as well as bonus experience points and early access to customizable items {{for the game}}'s multiplayer. Abandoned Territories Map Pack, released on October 15, 2013, added four new multiplayer maps, based on locations in the game's story. Nightmare Bundle, released on November 5, 2013, added a collection of ten head items, nine of which are available to purchase separately.|$|E
5|$|Since their {{invention}} in 1900, reflector sights {{have come}} to be used as gun sights on all kinds of weapons. They were used on fighter aircraft, in a limited capacity in World War I, widely used in World War II, and still used as the base component in many types of modern head-up displays. They have been used in other types of (usually large) weapons as well, such as anti-aircraft gun sights, anti tank gun <b>sights,</b> <b>and</b> any other role where the operator had to engage fast moving targets over a wide field of view, and the sight itself could be supplied with sufficient electrical power to function. There was some limited use of the sight on small arms after World War II but it came into widespread use after the late 1970s with the invention of the red dot sight, with a red light-emitting diode (LED) as its reticle, making a dependable sight with durability and extremely long illumination run time.|$|E
5|$|Many horses died as {{a result}} of the {{conditions}} at the front—of exhaustion, drowning, becoming mired in mud and falling in shell holes. Other horses were captured after their riders were killed. Horses also endured poor feeding and care, poison gas attacks that injured their respiratory systems and skin, and skin conditions such as mange. When gas warfare began in 1915, nose plugs were improvised for the horses to allow them to breathe during attacks. Later, several types of gas masks were developed by both the Central and Allied nations, although horses often confused them with feedbags and destroyed them. Soldiers found that better-bred horses were more likely to suffer from shell shock and act up when exposed to the <b>sights</b> <b>and</b> sounds of war than less-well-bred animals, who often learned to lie down and take cover at the sound of artillery fire. Veterinary hospitals were established to assist horses in recovering from shell shock and battle wounds, but thousands of equine corpses still lined the roads of the Western Front. In one year, 120,000horses were treated for wounds or disease by British veterinary hospitals alone. Ambulances and field veterinary hospitals were required to care for the horses, and horse trailers were first developed for use on the Western Front as equine ambulances. Disease was also a major issue for horses at the front, with equine influenza, ringworm, sand colic, sores from fly bites, and anthrax among the illnesses that affected them. British Army Army Veterinary Corps hospitals treated 725,216 horses over the course of the war, successfully healing 529,064. Horses were moved from the front to veterinary hospitals by several methods of transportation, including on foot, by rail and by barge. During the last months of the war, barges were considered ideal transportation for horses suffering wounds from shells and bombs.|$|E

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the museum began to collect material documenting the conflict. In November 1939, during the so-called 'Phoney War', the museum appeared in the opening sequence of the GPO Film Unit production The First Days, in which children are seen playing on some of the museum's German artillery pieces captured during the First World War. With the evacuation of British forces from Dunkirk in May/June 1940, however, the British Army's shortage of equipment saw eighteen of the museum's artillery pieces return to military service. The museum's trench clubs were used by the Home Guard, while other items such as <b>sights</b> <b>and</b> optical instruments were returned to the Ministry of Supply. The museum refused, however, to return some historic items such as a naval gun from HMS Lance (which had fired Britain's first shot of the First World War) or a gun served by Victoria Cross-winning boy seaman Jack Cornwell. The museum initially remained open but was closed {{for the duration of the}} war in September 1940 with the onset of the Blitz. On 31 January 1941 the museum was struck by a Luftwaffe bomb which fell on the naval gallery. A number of ship models were damaged by the blast and a Short Seaplane, which had flown at the Battle of Jutland, was destroyed. While closed to the public the museum's building was used for a variety of purposes connected to the war effort, such as a repair garage for government motor vehicles, a centre for Air Raid Precautions civil defence lectures and a fire fighting training school. In October 1945 the museum mounted a temporary exhibition, the first since the end of the war in August, which showcased technologies developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department. These included the submarine fuel pipeline PLUTO, the fog dispersal method FIDO, and flame weapons such as the Churchill Crocodile and Wasp Universal Carrier. However, due to bomb damage to both the building and exhibits, the museum was obliged to reopen its galleries piecemeal. The museum reopened a portion of its galleries in November 1946. A third of the galleries were opened in 1948 and a further wing opened in 1949.|$|E

5000|$|The {{predecessor}} to Crazy Eddie was {{a consumer}} electronics shop called <b>Sight</b> <b>And</b> Sound. It was a property of ERS Electronics, a company owned by Sam M. Antar, his son Eddie Antar, and Eddie's cousin Ronnie Gindi. <b>Sight</b> <b>And</b> Sound, located on Kings Highway in Brooklyn, began operation in 1969 and offered electronics at regular prices. Due to his aggressive sales techniques, Eddie quickly {{became known as}} [...] "Crazy Eddie", but within eighteen months the shop (as well as Eddie and Ronnie) was nearly bankrupt. Eddie bought out Gindi's one-third ownership stake of <b>Sight</b> <b>And</b> Sound, and Sam M. Antar retained his one-third stake but left the day-to-day operations to Eddie. In 1971, the <b>Sight</b> <b>And</b> Sound store on Kings Highway was renamed Crazy Eddie. Eddie continued his sales tactics with the renamed Crazy Eddie shop, but this time was successful. Eventually, Eddie closed that location and relocated the business to a bigger shop, {{just a few blocks}} from <b>Sight</b> <b>And</b> Sound's old location. In 1973, Antar opened the second Crazy Eddie location in Syosset, New York. A third followed during 1975, located in Manhattan. That year, Antar established a corporate main office in Brooklyn, New York.|$|R
