There they burned the bed-clothes, and the clothes, and the jewels, and the very boards of the waif woman's chests; and when the tide {{returned}} it washed away their ashes. <b>So</b> the <b>weird</b> of Thorgunna was lifted from the house on Frodis Water.|$|R
5000|$|DVD Talk {{gave the}} film a one and {{half out of}} five, writing [...] "Cheap and chintzy is one thing. Low-end and insipid is another, but what's on display here is simply too stupid to believe" [...] and [...] "McBride makes his villains <b>so</b> garishly <b>weird,</b> stupid and gross that it seems he's going for sort of a Texas Chainsaw Massacre tone, but the actors are so rotten, and the gore is so blatantly stupid-looking, that any sense of dread or {{discomfort}} is replaced by feelings of exasperated incredulity".|$|R
5000|$|Tomlinson told Perez Hilton's Danielle Sacco for Perez TV that, [...] "We were {{actually}} {{working with a}} few different names for the chorus, and the top name originally was 'Joanna', which is actually quite close to my mum's name, and it felt a little <b>weird</b> <b>so</b> we changed it to Diana." ...|$|R
500|$|In 2012, Levine {{appeared}} as a recurring character in the [...] of the television series American Horror Story. He plays Leo Morrison, a newly-wed photographer visiting modern-day Briarcliff Manor, an insane asylum, on honeymoon with wife Teresa, played by Jenna Dewan Tatum. The scenes were shot around his summer touring schedule. In an interview with E!, {{he said of his}} role: [...] "It sounded like so much fun and that's why I wanted to do it ... this sounds, like, hysterical, funny, dark and cool and right up my alley". However, he admitted to not being a fan of the show nor horror genre in general, stating he didn't watch the episodes because [...] "it's just <b>so</b> <b>weird</b> and disturbing".|$|E
500|$|King {{states the}} cover was odd; [...] "It {{took me a}} minute and a half to find a spot in the song where I knew where she was. It's <b>so</b> <b>weird.</b> If she had never told us, we would have never known. You could have played it for us and we'd have been like, 'What's that?' Like {{a minute and a}} half through I heard a line and was like, 'I know where she's at!" [...] In response, Slayer sent some T-shirts to Amos, which she said was appreciated. Hanneman echoed similar sentiments as King, but noted that a few years later when Slayer was playing a festival before Amos, Amos would allow Slayer to play a full set when the band was late.|$|E
500|$|Pitt {{took the}} role of Paul Maclean in the 1992 biographical film A River Runs Through It, {{directed}} by Robert Redford. His portrayal of the character was described by Peoples Janet Mock as a career-making performance, proving that Pitt could {{be more than a}} [...] "cowboy-hatted hunk." [...] He has admitted to feeling under pressure when making the film and thought it one of his [...] "weakest performances... It's <b>so</b> <b>weird</b> that it ended up being the one that I got the most attention for." [...] Pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew. He compared working with Redford to playing tennis with a superior player, saying [...] "when you play with somebody better than you, your game gets better." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Out of the Woods" [...] is a synthpop song, and {{the first}} song for which Swift wrote lyrics to a {{pre-existing}} track. Martin produced Swift's vocals for the song. Featuring heavy synths and percussion, Antonoff described that the song is given an arrangement that combines both 1980s and modern elements. A Yamaha DX7 {{is used for the}} 1980s-tinged sounds apparent on most parts of the song, but they are countered with the Minimoog Voyager during the chorus sections. [...] "All You Had to Do Was Stay" [...] was inspired by a dream of Swift's rather than a real-life romance. Swift recalled: [...] "I was trying to talk to someone important ... And that's all that would come out of my mouth. I woke up <b>so</b> <b>weirded</b> out!" [...] "Shake It Off" [...] is an uptempo pop song with a sound that is in stark contrast to Swift's previous releases, and consists of a central saxophone line. Jason Lipshutz from Billboard compared the song's melody to that of Macklemore & Ryan Lewis' song [...] "Thrift Shop" [...] (2013). Lyrically, the song is dedicated to Swift's detractors. Swift explained that, [...] "I've learned a pretty tough lesson that people can say whatever they want about us at any time, and we cannot control that. The only thing we can control is our reaction to that." ...|$|R
5000|$|The iOS {{version of}} Super Mega Worm has {{generally}} received mixed reviews from review sites. While Levi Buchanan of IGN stated [...] "It’s absolutely bizarre - the humor and WTF scenarios are truly funny - but unlike <b>so</b> many other <b>weird</b> games, Super Mega Worm is actually {{fun to play}} {{for more than five}} minutes".|$|R
5000|$|... "Every day I hit the stage, I {{look out}} at the {{audience}} and I think: 'They all bought those tickets to come and see me perform. Oh my God, they are singing my song, they're screaming my name.' That's when all gets <b>weird.</b> <b>So</b> it's kind of overwhelming". —Rihanna talking about her fans during the Documentary Feature interview.|$|R
500|$|His {{performance}} {{style has}} been studied by academics who analysed gender, image and sexuality. For example one author noted that Jagger's performance style [...] "opened up definitions of gendered masculinity and so laid the foundations for self-invention and sexual plasticity which are now {{an integral part of}} contemporary youth culture". His stage personas also contributed significantly to the British tradition of popular music that always featured the character song and where the art of singing becomes a matter of actingwhich creates a question about the singer's relationship to his own words. His voice {{has been described as a}} powerful expressive tool for communicating feelings to his audience, and expressing an alternative vision of society. To express [...] "virility and unrestrained passion" [...] he developed techniques previously used by African American preachers and gospel singers such as [...] "the roar, the guttural belt style of singing, and the buzz, a more nasal and raspy sound". Steven Van Zandt wrote: [...] "The acceptance of Jagger's voice on pop radio was a turning point in rock & roll. He broke open the door for everyone else. Suddenly, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison weren't <b>so</b> <b>weird</b> – even Bob Dylan." ...|$|E
500|$|... "…Baby One More Time" [...] {{has been}} covered on {{numerous}} occasions. One {{of the earliest}} live covers of the song was by the Scottish band Travis, recorded during one of their concerts at [...] "The Bay Tavern" [...] in Robin Hood's Bay, North Yorkshire, England. The song was later included in the release of their 1999 single, [...] "Turn". Lead singer Francis Healey said, [...] "We did it for a laugh the first time. [...] And as we played it, the irony slipped from my smile. It's a very well-crafted song. It [...] that magic thing." [...] The Guardian said this cover showed {{a new and more}} [...] "dark" [...] side of the band, commenting [...] "slowed down to a mournful crawl, it was amazing how ominous the couplet [...] "This loneliness is killing me / Hit me, baby, one more time" [...] sounded". PopWreckoning.com called it [...] "perhaps the most well done cover of Britney's catalyst to eternal fame". Spears heard their version while shopping in a mall and said, [...] "It was <b>so</b> <b>weird.</b> I liked it though, I thought it was cool. It was a very different vibe from what I did".|$|E
500|$|The song's bleak lyrics were {{explained}} by Marker as {{a mockery of}} the angsty [...] " [...] thing" [...] themes prevalent in mid-1990s alternative rock songs, as well as a self-deprecating reference to Garbage's own dark lyrics, with Manson explaining that the song was [...] "a dig at ourselves because we like records that don't make us feel very happy, and at this so-called 'alternative' scene of 'we're <b>so</b> <b>weird</b> and more wonderful than everybody else'". Vig added that [...] "'Only Happy When It Rains' was about what happened with grunge and the angst-filled thing which has dominated the American alternative rock scene. With us there's self-deprecation, we have to poke fun at ourselves because we're so incredibly obsessive about the songs and the lyrics, which makes us filled with self-loathing, hurhur." [...] Garbage said they referenced both the title of The Jesus and Mary Chain song [...] "Happy When It Rains" [...] (1987) and Manson's own Scottish psyche. Lyrically, Manson described [...] "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] as [...] "about wanting love but knowing life will always get in the way.... yet not being obliterated by that. It's a song for people that know {{what it is like to}} live on the dark side of life. It's about devotion but a different kind. A devotion to the truth and to freedom... and to hell with the consequences." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's marvellous, Nevitt," [...] Guy {{broke out}} at last; [...] "never heard even Sarasate himself do {{anything}} quite <b>so</b> wild and <b>weird</b> as that. What's the piece called? It {{seems to have}} something almost impish or sprite-like in its wailing music. It's Hungarian, of course, or Polish or Greek; I detect at once the Oriental tinge in it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Super Adventure Rockman {{has been}} poorly received. Brett Elston of GamesRadar {{included}} {{the game in}} his retrospective on the series {{for the sake of}} completeness. [...] "It's a bizarre animated/FMV/first-person game that doesn't really fit anywhere in the main series," [...] Elston stated. [...] "But is <b>so</b> damn <b>weird</b> it has to be pointed out." [...] GameSpot writers Christian Nutt and Justin Speer summarized the game as [...] "an intensely boring and unplayable excursion into timed button pressing". 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish thought the game may be acceptable for those who understand Japanese. Inafune has apologized to fans for the alleged low quality of the game.|$|R
2500|$|... "D.A.F." [...] {{received}} healthy radio airplay {{from numerous}} mainstream stations including the Today Network. This {{came as a}} surprise for the band, as only their previous single, [...] "Pick You Up", had achieved such airplay. Lead singer Bernard Fanning commented that [...] "You can't really control who plays what you do on the radio, <b>so</b> it's pretty <b>weird</b> hearing your song on B105".|$|R
500|$|... "Raining Blood" [...] {{was covered}} by Tori Amos on her 2001 album Strange Little Girls. King has {{admitted}} that he thought the cover was odd: [...] "It took me {{a minute and a}} half to find a spot in the song where I knew where she was. It's <b>so</b> <b>weird.</b> If she had never told us, we would have never known. You could have played it for us and we'd have been like, 'What's that?' Like {{a minute and a half}} through I heard a line and was like, 'I know where she's at!'". The band, however, liked the cover enough to send Slayer T-shirts to her. The song was also covered by Malevolent Creation, Chimaira, Vader, Dokaka, Reggie and the Full Effect and Killick Erik Hinds, who covered the entire album on a H'arpeggione. [...] "Raining Blood" [...] was also covered by the New Zealand drum and bass band Concord Dawn on their 2003 album Uprising, and by Nashville, Tennessee band Asschapel on their 7" [...] "Satanation". A medley of [...] "Raining Blood" [...] and [...] "Postmortem" [...] appears on Body Count's 2016 album Bloodlust, preceded by a short monologue by lead singer Ice-T where he names Slayer as both a major influence on Body Count and as one of his favorite bands of all time [...] "and always will be"; a video for Body Count's version was released in August of 2017.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{had been}} {{reported}} for several years that Jackson had an abusive childhood, he first spoke openly {{about it in a}} 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey. He grimaced when speaking of the childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he stated he had missed out on much of his childhood, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. In the same interview, speaking of his father, Jackson said, [...] "There were times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick...I'd start to regurgitate. I'm sorry...Please don't be mad at me...But I do love him". In Jackson's other high-profile interview Living with Michael Jackson (2003), he covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse. Jackson recalled that Joseph sat in a chair as the group rehearsed, saying, [...] "He had this belt in his hand. If you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you. It was bad. Real bad". When Jackson received his Living Legend award—presented to him by Janet Jackson—at the 1993 Grammys, he said, [...] "I don't read all the things written about me, I wasn't aware the world thought I was <b>so</b> <b>weird</b> and bizarre. But when you grow up like I did in front of 100million people since the age of five, you're automatically different...My childhood was completely taken away from me. There was no Christmas, no birthdays. It was not a normal childhood, no normal pleasures of childhood. Those were exchanged for hard work, struggle and pain, and eventual material and professional success".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{has been}} {{generally}} well received, being praised by many critics for its writing. In a 2009 review for Slate, Josh Levin wrote that [...] "The greatness of 'Stark Raving Dad' {{has a lot}} more to do with The Simpsons writing staff than with Jackson's voice-over talents. The show's scripters came up with a plot device far more ingenious than simply dropping the singer into Springfield." [...] Monica Collins of the Boston Herald also enjoyed the episode. On the day it first aired, she wrote that [...] "This episode is vintage Simpsons, crammed with divinely vulgar visual oddities. And Michael Jackson, of course, is just <b>so</b> <b>weird</b> anyway that he fits right in." [...] Mark Lorando of The Times-Picayune commented that [...] "throwaway lines on The Simpsons are funnier than the big punchlines on most so-called comedy series; [...] has layers of humor, satirical touches that enrich the story lines," [...] singling out jokes like the America's Funniest Home Video parody. [...] "The laughs are literally non-stop, and Jackson's unmistakable vocal presence [...] adds a thousand watts of star power." [...] In 2011, Television Blend's Eric Eisenberg named [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] the best episode of the entire series. He praised it for being heartful and stated that what [...] "prevents the episode from seeming artificial or manipulative is that the writing in the episode earns the earnest moments", and further elaborates that while [...] "strong emotions might be the hallmark of 'Stark Raving Dad,' it would be a sincere mistake to ignore how funny it is." [...] He concluded that the episode [...] "is perfectly constructed, is filled with both deep belly laughs and tears, and is simply the greatest episode of The Simpsons" ...|$|E
50|$|Firstly, Han Han {{explains}} the stories behind the book. He writes {{that he took}} almost one year to finish these ten thousand words. During this period, Han Han admits that he didnt write them all at once but stopped at irregular intervals. That intermittent writing way brings about two main problems. One is low efficiency. Another is usually, when {{he picked up his}} pen again, he could not remember the previous plots. <b>So</b> the <b>weird</b> phenomenon that sometimes a story does not end but another new story starts without any transition usually shows up in this work. He emphasized that these on and off plots were indeed a result of his laziness, not any special writing techniques.|$|R
5000|$|Entertainment Weeklys Dalton Ross {{gave the}} series DVD release an A- rating and commented, [...] "It was too smart. Too funny. Too <b>weird.</b> <b>So,</b> of course, it failed." [...] While not overtly positive, Noel Murray of The A.V.

6000|$|The widow tottered {{into the}} parlor and sank into a chair with a gasp, and Rowena followed, tongue-tied and dazed. The two sat silent in the {{throbbing}} summer heat unconscious of the million-voiced music of the mosquitoes, unconscious of the roaring gale, the lashing and thrashing of the rain along the windows and the roof, the white glare of the lightning, the tumultuous booming and bellowing of the thunder; conscious of nothing but that prodigy, that uncanny apparition that {{had come and gone}} <b>so</b> suddenly--that <b>weird</b> strange thing that was so soft-spoken and so gentle of manner and yet had shaken them up like an earthquake with the shock of its gruesome aspect. At last a cold little shudder quivered along down the widow's meager frame and she said in a weak voice: ...|$|R
500|$|While still {{rooted in}} pop punk, Blink-182 finds the band {{expanding}} their sonic template with darker, restless songs. The compositions {{on the record}} {{have been described as}} musically diverse and [...] "borderline experimental," [...] with sullen moodiness and off-kilter hooks the basis for many tracks. The record pulls from a variety of styles, including electronic rock, jangle pop, and [...] "reflective" [...] alternative rock. Experimentation was constantly present: the band tried different mic techniques and toyed with harmonium organs, Polynesian Gamelan bells, [...] and turntables. The band infused these experimentalist elements into their usual pop punk sound, inspired by lifestyle changes (the band members all became fathers before the album was released) and side-projects (Box Car Racer and Transplants.) In a full article about the album in the November 20, 2003 edition of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Ben Wener described the music of the album as [...] "expansive, downcast, and sometimes spectral." [...] The New York Times considered that the album may have been influenced by the growing popularity of emo pop, while AllMusic regarded it a delve into post-punk. [...] "Much of the punk has been dissolved, the buzzsaw guitars faded into the corners, allowing room for staggering dynamics, cathartic guitar bursts and a weightier, more experimental and ambitious sound", wrote Tom Bryant of Kerrang!. The goal for Blink-182 was continuity: each song develops lyrically like chapters in a book, and songs segue into one another to present a cohesive feel instead of a regular collection of tracks. [...] In addition to the side-projects, the music of the album was inspired by the September 11 attacks and the onset of the Iraq War. The mood was unsettling for DeLonge, whose brother is a Navy officer: [...] "It was <b>so</b> <b>weird</b> because we'd all be glued to the TV, watching these bombs explode over another country. So I'd see all this and wonder where he was at, and then we'd have to go into the next room and sing or finish writing lyrics. I think it affected our moods throughout the day." [...] In addition, it was just inspired by socializing: [...] "We would just hang out for hours talking. It was really cool", said DeLonge.|$|E
2500|$|One-time friend Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins wrote {{lyrics to}} the Massive Attack song [...] "Teardrop", {{thinking}} of Buckley's death, stating: [...] "That was <b>so</b> <b>weird</b> ...

2500|$|During {{his time}} with the Descendents, Navetta {{was known for his}} {{aggressive}} playing and eccentric personality. [...] "I know he had a rough familial thing growing up," [...] recalled Stevenson, [...] "just a lot of familial discord, and I think that can fuel a fire pretty well. I never sat there and went ‘wow, what made this guy <b>so</b> <b>weird?</b> [...] "All three of us—Frank, Bill, and I—came from divorced families," [...] said Lombardo, [...] "so that was maybe one of our bonds of commonality." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{this was}} not getting back to George Washington and the early struggles of the Republic. So I {{returned}} to the commander-in-chief, but found, after one or two leading questions, that she was rather inclined to resent his re-appearance on the stage. Her reminiscences here were chiefly social and local, and more or less flavored with Perkins. We got {{back as far as}} the Revolutionary epoch, or, rather, her impressions of that epoch, when it was still fresh in the public mind. And here I came upon an incident, purely personal and local, but, withal, <b>so</b> novel, <b>weird,</b> and uncanny, that for a while I fear it quite displaced George Washington in my mind, and tinged the autumnal fields beyond with a red that was not of the sumach. I do not remember to have read of it in the books. I do not know that it is entirely authentic. It was attested to me by mother and daughter, as an uncontradicted tradition.|$|R
60|$|He {{had passed}} the quaint old house at Chaigely, the sudden yelp of a chained dog in the court-yard giving him a thrill of horror as he went by, and he had reached the bend {{in that part of}} the road which is {{opposite}} the towering wood-covered Kemple End. A keen and cutting blast swept through the black firs that crowned the summit, and stood, like solemn sentinels, upon the declivity. There was a music in the wind mournful as a croon over the corpse of a beautiful woman, whose hair still shimmers with the golden light of life; but Adam heard no melody in the moaning sighs which seemed to fill the air around. To him, whose soul was yet under the influence of the terror through which he had so recently passed, the sounds assumed an awful nature; whilst the firs, standing so clearly defined against the snow, which lay in virgin heaps upon the beds of withered fern, seemed like <b>so</b> many <b>weird</b> skeletons shaking their bony arms in menace or in warning.|$|R

[...] . I have a feeling for this instrument not unlike the awe I should feel in the presence of a great magician in whom I really believed. Its powers are <b>so</b> enormous, and <b>weird,</b> and fantastical, that I should have a personal fear in being with it alone. Music drew an angel down, said the poet: but what is that to drawing down worlds!' ...|$|R
2500|$|The website BuzzFeed {{interviewed a}} man named Ray, who {{was a friend of}} Mess and an {{acquaintance}} of Tsarnaev. Ray said: Tam wasn't there at the memorial service, he wasn't at the funeral, he wasn't around at all... And he was really close with Brendan. That's why it's <b>so</b> <b>weird</b> when he said, 'I don't have any American friends.' Ray continued: [...] "He was somebody who was in contact with Brendan on a daily basis.

[...] Kimmel has often joked that the only reason he got into show business was just so he can be friends with Letterman, he has also questioned why anybody would watch his show instead of Letterman's. Kimmel wrote a piece for Time writing his love for Letterman by saying, [...] "As I write this, there are only 10 shows left before the funniest, most inventive and smartest man who ever wore an Alka Seltzer suit goes fishing for good. None of us who discovered Dave on our own and claimed him as our own {{will ever be able to}} satisfactorily explain to the younger people who didn’t what he did, what he meant and what he means.
