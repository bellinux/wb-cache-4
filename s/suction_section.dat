40|$|Wind tunnels {{are used}} to study {{airflows}} around objects like cars, airplanes and ice-skaters. This is done, simulating the real world, by blowing an airflow over a fixed body. In the real situation an object moves through the air, while in a wind tunnel it is the air that is moving. So a wind tunnel needs to generate an airflow. In this airflow, at {{the walls of the}} wind tunnel, an undesired effect occurs called boundary layer development. A thin layer of air is retarded due to friction of the airflow with the walls of the tunnel. In an automotive wind tunnel, which simulates airflows around cars, this boundary layer will also develop over the ground plane under the car. Because this boundary layer is not present on the road, this ground plane boundary layer should be minimized for accurate simulations. To minimize the ground plane boundary layer many techniques are implemented in wind tunnels {{and one of them is}} boundary layer suction. With boundary layer suction, a <b>suction</b> <b>section</b> in the wind tunnel floor removes, or partly removes, the boundary layer by sucking air away from the main airflow. This <b>suction</b> <b>section</b> is the main subject of this master thesis. Research will be done on a new suction system with an adaptive suction duct geometry. It will explore the possibilities to control the suction speed distribution on this suction system by adapting the geometry of the duct by actuators. A model of a system with an adaptive geometry is made based on the physical properties of the airflow in the duct. This model is verified by measurements on a test setup. It is found that different control techniques can be used to control the suction speed distribution of the airflow through a porous material. The capabilities of the controlled system are quantified for wind tunnel integration. Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E
40|$|As {{two common}} kinds of air supply modes, natural wind and {{mechanical}} wind have obvious differences on human sensation. From former researches, {{it can be}} seen that the 1 /f fluctuation property of the spectrum of natural wind is an important factor to cause people feel more comfortable. While, the spectrum of mechanical wind often deviates from 1 /f fluctuation because of its relatively more high-frequency fluctuating energy, which also brings some difficulties for imitating natural wind. This paper compares the airflow of the <b>suction</b> <b>section</b> with that of the blowing section of an axial fan. The result shows that high-frequency fluctuating energy of the suction section’s airflow is lower than that of the blowing section’s, consequently the spectrum of the suction section’s airflow is relatively more close to 1 /f fluctuation. By using these two airflows to blow the subjects ’ arms, the subject’s sensation vote was conducted. Majority of the subjects reflected that the blowing section’s airflow was harder and with more violent stimulus than the suction section’s, and the suction section’s airflow was more acceptable to the subjects. The experiment finds a simple way to decrease high-frequency fluctuating energy of mechanical airflow, which will be helpful for imitating natural wind better...|$|E

40|$|Feeding a {{premature}} infant {{is a concern}} {{when it comes to}} neonatal care and breastfeeding has been recommended. However, not all services advocates breastfeeding to their patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the effects of sucking on the feeding bottle and on the breast regarding the oxygen saturation, skin temperature, heart as well as respiratory rates. Each of the premature infants was its own control, being submitted to bottle <b>suction</b> <b>sections</b> as well as breastfeeding sections. In total, 76 <b>sections</b> of <b>suction</b> were carried out, in which the variables skin temperature, heart and respiratory rates as well as oxygen saturation were monitored. Skin temperature and heart and respiratory rates did not present statistically significant differences. There were important alterations in oxygen saturation, with greater occurrence for feeding bottle. Breast suction was shown to be less stressful than the feeding bottle suction, concerning oxygen saturation...|$|R
500|$|It uses suction gaskets. [...] Gaskets in {{standard}} fire hose ("pressure gaskets") {{are designed to}} minimize the water leaking out between couplings. [...] The gaskets connecting hard <b>suction</b> hose <b>sections,</b> pump, and strainer must instead prevent air from entering at the coupling, since that would spoil the vacuum and allow air into the pump intake. Large diameter ( [...] or greater) hard suction hose will typically use Storz fittings, which are genderless. [...] or smaller hard suction hose will typically use threaded fittings. [...] In each case, the hard suction hose connection will match the fittings of the pump intake and supply hose, so that hard suction hose {{can be used in}} place of supply hose as appropriate.|$|R
30|$|In {{spite of}} the PCP’s high {{capacity}} of handling sand, some wells in the heavy oil fields in Canada, such as the well under consideration, tend to experience an excessive inflow of sand beyond the pump capacity. When an excessive amount of sand flows into the wellbore, these accumulated sands must be physically removed. Well services, however, must be avoided {{as much as possible}} not only from the economical point of view but also from the operational point of view. In addition, dry operation has a significant impact on PCP. In order to prevent dry operation from occurring, the fluid level needs to be kept above the pump <b>suction.</b> In <b>Section</b> “Fluid level and well optimization”, a discussion on fluid level and well optimization is provided.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} in the NASA Langley Low-Turbulence Pressure Tunnel to evaluate a suction sidewall boundary-layer-control (BLC) technique used in testing 2 D high-lift airfoils. Sidewall BLC is required to maintain spanwise two-dimensionality of the flow over the airfoil at large angles of attack. A supercritical-type high-lift air-foil, equipped with a double-slotted flap and a leading-edge slat, was used for the study which was conducted at a Mach number of 0. 2 and Reynolds numbers based on chord of 9 and 16 million. The sidewall BLC technique, which features distributed suction through porous endplates connected to a venting system, was able to control sidewall boundary-layer separation and maintain two-dimensional flow over the high-lift configuration for both Reynolds numbers tested. Discussions on porous endplate optimization and effects of <b>suction</b> on <b>section</b> lift are presented. Results obtained with the suction system were also compared with previous data obtained with a tangential blowing BLC system for the same high-lift configuration...|$|R
5000|$|The {{temperature}} measurement is critical, and consequently commercial distributors of thermodynamic pump testing equipment often quote an accuracy of greater than 0.001°C. Such accuracy is necessary {{as the temperature}} rise across a pump may be less than 0.05°C. Typically, temperature probes are inserted directly into the flow, and pressure measurements are taken from taps on both the <b>suction</b> and discharge <b>sections</b> of the pipe. Then, the head on the pump is varied by some sort of adjustment such as throttling a discharge valve, utilizing different pump combinations in parallel, or adjusting well levels. [...] This allows the pump’s performance to be tested across its range of operation as its head, and hence flow, is varied.|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{developments}} of seven turbulent boundary layers have been measured {{on the upper}} surfaces of three suction aerofoils. Distributed suction was applied, in each case, through a porous plastic suction surface that occupied most of the chord. Good agreement was obtained between the measured development of R o and the predictions of the two-dimensional form of the momentum integral equation when the new skin-friction law taking direct account {{of the effect of}} suction was used. The growth of H is predicted very accurately by Head's entrainment approach provided that laminar reversion is absent and that measured H values are used ~o start the calculations. The simple assumptions for velocity profile shape are found to be inaccurate when the adverse pressure gradients affect the inner region but, before this problem can be tackled satisfactorily, further investigation is required into profile behaviour in the absence of transpiration. Spanwise pitot traverses show that the measured layers are closely two-dimensional. The distribution of suction rate along the chord is also known accurately although surface tube traverses indicate that the supporting structure is partly blocking the <b>suction</b> flow. <b>Section...</b>|$|R
40|$|Eleven semi-span wing {{models were}} tested in the 1 / 8 -scale model of the Langley V/STOL tunnel to qualitatively study vortex bursting. Flow {{visualization}} was achieved by using helium filled soap bubbles introduced upstream of the model. The angle of attack range was from 0 deg to 45 deg. The {{results show that the}} vortex is unstable, that is, the bursting point location is not fixed at a given angle of attack but moves within certain bounds. Upstream of the trailing edge, the bursting point location has a range of two inches; downstream, the range is about six inches. Anhedral and dihedral appear to have an insignificant effect on the vortex and its bursting point location. Altering the <b>section</b> <b>suction</b> distribution by improving the triangularity generally increases the angle of attack at which vortex bursting occurs at the trailing edge...|$|R
40|$|The pore {{structure}} {{is of great}} importance for a materials ability to hold and transport gas and moisture. In lime plaster, it affects hardening, carbonation as well as durability against frost damage. In the present paper, eleven mixtures of lime mortar were studied with respect to frost damages. The binders used were lime slaked in four different ways, hydraulic lime and cement. Several analyses were made to characterize the transport properties and the {{pore structure}} of the materials; density, porosity, sorption curves, capillary water <b>suction</b> and thin <b>sections.</b> This study shows {{that there is a}} correlation between pore structure and important material properties. By studying these parameters, it is possible to get a good picture of the materials ability to resist frost damages. The study also gives an indication of what materials in the mortar such as binders, aggregates and water, give a good pore structure...|$|R
40|$|The wake {{behind a}} {{rectangular}} forebody with variable inlet conditions is investigated. The perforated {{surface of the}} two-dimensional rectangular forebody, with a smooth leading edge and a blunt trailing edge, allows for boundary layer modification by means of wall <b>suction.</b> The test <b>section,</b> of which the rectangular forebody is the main part, is experimentally evaluated {{with a series of}} hot-wire and Prandtl tube measurements in the boundary layer and the wake. For a suction coefficient of Γ> 9, corresponding to 0. 9 % suction of the free stream velocity, the asymptotic suction boundary layer (ASBL) is obtained at the trailing edge of the forebody for laminar boundary layers (Rex= 1. 6 × 105 − 3. 8 × 105). The key feature of the ASBL, a spatially invariant boundary thickness which can be modified independent of the Reynolds number, is used to perform a unique parametrical study. Turbulent boundary layers (Rex= 4. 5 × 105 − 3. 0 × 106) subject to wall suction are also investigated. For a critical suction coefficient Γcrit, which depends on Rex, the boundary layer relaminarizes. Strong evidence is found to support the hypothesis that turbulent boundary layers will ultimately attain the ASBL as well, provided that the wall suction is strong enough. The effect of the modulated laminar and turbulent boundary layers on the wake characteristics is studied. The shape of the mean wake velocity profile, scaled with the velocity deficit U 0 and the wake half width ∆y 1 / 2, is found tobe independent of x/h, for x/h> 6 and Reh > 6. 7 × 103. The wake width is shown to scale with the effective thickness of the body h+ 2 δ 1, where the ratio is expected to vary with the downstream location. A decrease of the displacement thickness leads to a decrease of the base pressure, with Cp,b = − 0. 36 in the ASBL limit. The Strouhal number based on the effective thickness becomes Sth+ 2 δ 1 ≈ 0. 29 in the ASBL limit and independent of the plate thickness (h) Reynolds number, in the range Reh = 2. 9 × 103 − 6. 7 × 103. For the turbulent boundary Sth+ 2 δ 1 is found to be 25 % lower, which shows that the wake characteristics depend {{on the state of the}} boundary layer at the trailing edge. The total drag is found to be reduced by as much as 30 % for Reh = 2. 7 × 104 when a wall normal velocity of only 3. 5 % of the free stream velocity is applied. Wall suction successively reduces the total drag with increasing wall suction, at least in the Reynolds number rangeReh = 8. 0 × 103 − 5. 5 × 104. QC 20140312 </p...|$|R
