40|$|AbstractWhen {{ferritic}} {{stainless steels}} {{are exposed to}} the temperature range of 400 - 550 °C, they undergo 475 °C embrittlement that could be attributed to the spinodal decomposition. In the present study, high-chromium ferritic stainless steel, type 447, was aged at 520 °C under both static and cyclic loading conditions and microstructure was analyzed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). By aging under <b>static</b> <b>condition,</b> hardness and tensile strength were largely increased. TEM observation revealed the mottled contrast due to the typical spinodal decomposition of Cr phase. Under cyclic loading condition, increases in hardness and tensile strength were smaller than those under <b>static</b> <b>condition.</b> TEM micrographs of the specimens subjected to cyclic loading exhibited a lower contrast of the mottled pattern than those of the specimens aged under <b>static</b> <b>condition,</b> indicating that cyclic loading suppressed the spinodal decomposition, thus resulting in the lower increases in hardness and tensile strength...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. High purity Flibe was {{prepared}} for corrosion study. Fundamental corrosion experiments in <b>static</b> <b>condition</b> were performed on the structural material for Flibe blanket and Material Research Loop, which is non-isothermal forced convection loop simulating the blanket condition. Corrosion rate for the structural materials in <b>static</b> <b>condition</b> was estimated as small as 0. 83 - 5. 4 µm/yr in the high purity Flibe. The corrosion rate is acceptable for the structural materials. Main corrosion process was identified as formation of oxide corrosion products and their dissolution into Flibe, therefore oxygen impurity control will reduce corrosion weight loss further. The good compatibility between the fabricated Flibe and the structural materials, and progress in other related R&D indicate feasibility for Material Research Loop and the Flibe blanket. 1...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{well known}} <b>static</b> <b>{{condition}}</b> that characterizes how two or more charged black holes stay in place: this condition is |qi |=mi, where a black hole (labeled by i) has electric charge qi and mass mi. For nearly half a century, this <b>static</b> <b>condition</b> has eluded a simple physical interpretation, without appealing to forces. I provide the first proof that the <b>static</b> <b>condition,</b> |qi |=mi, corresponds to an extremum of the black holes’ total energy. My approach uses geometry and calculus {{in the context of}} general relativity. For the non-specialist, this work draws upon one’s intuitive familiarity with static electricity and gravity, and extends these ideas to black holes. For specialists, this work is significant since it uses the preferred approach of energy (not forces) to prove, for the first time, a cornerstone property (maximum or minimum energy) for these black holes, which is an energy property known to hold for other static black holes. The research summary in the following pages was presented as a student talk at the 2015 CSU Student Research Competition, and won a first prize.

40|$|Saccades to {{somatosensory}} targets have longer latencies and {{are less}} accurate and precise than saccades to visual targets. Here we examined how different somatosensory information influences the planning and control of saccadic eye movements. Participants fixated a central cross and initiated a saccade {{as fast as possible}} in response to a tactile stimulus that was presented to either the index or the middle fingertip of their unseen left hand. In a <b>static</b> <b>condition,</b> the hand remained at a target location for the entire block of trials and the stimulus was presented at a fixed time after an auditory tone. Therefore, the target location was derived only from proprioceptive and tactile information. In a moving condition, the hand was first actively moved to the same target location and the stimulus was then presented immediately. Thus, in the moving condition additional kinesthetic information about the target location was available. We found shorter saccade latencies in the moving compared to the <b>static</b> <b>condition,</b> but no differences in accuracy or precision of saccadic endpoints. In a second experiment, we introduced variable delays after the auditory tone (<b>static</b> <b>condition)</b> or {{after the end of the}} hand movement (moving condition) in order to reduce the predictability of the moment of the stimulation and to allow more time to process the kinesthetic information. Again, we found shorter latencies in the moving compared to the <b>static</b> <b>condition</b> but no improvement in saccade accuracy or precision. In a third experiment, we showed that the shorter saccade latencies in the moving condition cannot be explained by the temporal proximity between the relevant event (auditory tone or end of hand movement) and the moment of the stimulation. Our findings suggest that kinesthetic information facilitates planning, but not control, of saccadic eye movements to proprioceptive-tactile targets...|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} {{method for}} the successful ex vivo propagation of P. falciparum described culture of the parasite under <b>static</b> <b>conditions</b> (Trager-Jensen method). James B. Jensen joined Trager’s laboratory as a post-doctoral fellow in 1976. [...] He decided to employ a candlejar instead of the [...] incubator. In the summer of 1976 Milton Friedman, {{a graduate student in}} the Trager lab who was working in the MRC laboratories in The Gambia, arranged for a sample of human blood infected with P. falciparum to be sent to New York City. This was diluted with RPMI 1640 (which {{turned out to be the}} best of the commercial media) in Petri dishes, placed in a candlejar and incubated. The line grew very well and became FCR-3/Gambia, one of the most widely used strains. Later, other lines would be established using similar methods and the impact of continuous cultivation of P. falciparum was phenomenal especially for the testing of putative antimalarials and for deciphering its genes. A number of subsequent reports (from as far back as the early 1980s), showed that cell suspension (using a shaking-incubator) significantly increased culture growth. Continuous agitation has also been shown to improve other parameters of culture growth relevant to researchers, such as the prolongation of culture synchrony after synchronization procedures, and a reduction of the rate of multiple infections. [...] Despite this, the practice of culturing the parasite under <b>static</b> <b>conditions</b> remains widespread. The greatest value of the candlejar method is that it can be used in laboratories almost anywhere in the world where there is an incubator, a candle and a desiccator. Around 60% parasitized cells can be obtained using optimized culturing conditions. Recent studies of P. falciparum isolated directly from infected patients indicate that alternative parasite biological states occur in the natural host that are not observed with ex vivo cultivated parasites.|$|E
2500|$|The exact {{location}} of the initial fire, its source of ignition, {{and the source of}} fuel remain subjects of debate. The cause of the accident has never been determined conclusively, although many hypotheses have been proposed. Sabotage theories notwithstanding, one hypothesis often put forth involves a combination of gas leakage and atmospheric <b>static</b> <b>conditions.</b> Escaping hydrogen gas (in this specific case from incomplete or damaged vents {{along the top of the}} vessel and especially near the rear upper tail fin) will typically burn after mixing with air and will explode when mixed with air in the right proportions. This, along with the high static collected from flying within stormy conditions could have combined to ignite the leaking gas and down the airship. In addition, a certain amount of gas may have been inexplicably lost out the top of the vessel for, at the same time, water ballast was noticeably released to slow the rate of descent. The initial explosion would therefore have been the result of the quickening fire reaching the gas bags themselves via the compromised aft-most vent at the vessel's stern. Another more recent theory involves the airship's outer covering. The silvery cloth covering contained material including cellulose nitrate which is highly flammable. This theory is controversial and has been rejected by other researchers because the outer skin burns too slowly to account for the rapid flame propagation and gaps in the fire correspond with internal gas cell divisions, which wouldn't be visible if the fire spread across the skin first. Hydrogen fires had previously destroyed many other airships.|$|E

40|$|A {{high-density}} EEG {{study was}} conducted to investigate evoked and oscillatory activity in response to three different stimulus speeds of simulated forward motion in adult participants. Participants were shown an optic flow stimulus consisting of a virtual road with moving poles at either side of it simulating forward motion at three different speeds (low, medium, and high) with a <b>static</b> control <b>condition</b> between each motion condition. The aim was to analyse the N 2 component of visual motion and the evoked oscillatory activity in occipital and parietal areas. A significant difference in N 2 latencies and peak amplitudes between the three stimulus speeds were found in parietal channels P 3 and P 4. The peak latency significantly increased as the simulated speeds increased, while the peak amplitudes decreased at increasing speeds. The latency differences were thought to indicate that the low simulated speed was easier to process than the faster medium and high simulated speeds, while the change in peak amplitude seemed {{to be the result of}} a greater number of neurons being attuned to the lower as opposed to the higher stimulus speeds. Theta-band synchronizations and alpha-band de-synchronizations in the three different speeds were observed, but no significant differences between the speeds were found. The <b>static</b> <b>condition,</b> in contrast, showed theta-band de-synchronizations and alpha-band synchronizations. Significant differences between the alpha de-synchronizations in the three different speeds and the alpha synchronizations in the <b>static</b> <b>condition</b> were found in the parietal midline source, while no significant differences were found between conditions in the theta oscillations. It was suggested that the alpha de-synchronizations reflect an activated state, possibly related to the visual processing of the three speeds, whereas the alpha synchronizations in response to the <b>static</b> <b>condition</b> reflect a deactivated resting period. </p...|$|R
