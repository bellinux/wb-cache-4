25|$|Other architecturally notable {{buildings}} can {{be found}} at Mount Southwell Terrace, which is located {{at the top of the}} Market Square, just off Castle Street.

The new 90 Squadron was similar to 38 Squadron since it had detachments at Leadenham and Stamford Aerodromes with the same FE 2B fighters however during September 1918 this changed when the squadron regrouped at Buckminster and was re-equipped with the Avro 504K(NF). The squadron then disbanded on 13 June 1919 here at Buckminster.|$|E

25|$|After Sigismund's {{death in}} 1437, his widow Barbara of Celje was imprisoned {{in the castle}} by the new king Albert of Habsburg. In 1438, Albert's daughter, Anne was engaged to the margrave William III, Landgrave of Thuringia in the castle. John Hunyadi and his wife Erzsébet Szilágyi also <b>stayed</b> <b>here</b> and Hungarian women {{respected}} them. Later on, Ladislas the Posthumous was probably living in the castle (parts of the castle were adapted for him at least). In 1440-1443, there were fighting between the castle of Pressburg ruled by county heads from the Rozgonyi family (supporting King Władysław III of Poland) {{and the town of}} Pressburg (supporting– and owned by– Queen Elisabeth which ruled for the young Ladislaus Posthumus)– see History of Pressburg for details. Castle repairs of 1438, 1452 and 1463 included repairs of damages caused by the above conflict. A water well was constructed in the yard of the castle in the 15th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{center of}} the modern city is the Plaza de la Paz (Plaza of Peace), {{also known as the}} Plaza Mayor (Main Plaza). Since the colonial period, the richest of the city’s {{families}} built their main homes here, along with government buildings and the parish church, now a basilica. This plaza is a garden with a sculpture of a woman representing peace; its placement here in the late 19th century caused the official name to change to Plaza de la Paz. Today, the plaza is surrounded by the basilica, other churches, government and commercial buildings, many of which were once mansions. Still remaining around the plaza are mansions that belonged to local nobility such as the Counts of Rul, Count of Galvez, and the Count De los Chico. The Rul house was constructed {{at the end of the}} 18th century by architect Francisco Eduardo Tresguerras. It is noted for its inner courtyard, with architectural features from ancient Greece. Alexander von Humboldt <b>stayed</b> <b>here</b> in 1803. Later, the house became known as the Palacio de Otero. The Casa Real de Ensaye is a Baroque mansion that, on its façade, bears the first noble coat of arms granted in Guanajuato.|$|E
25|$|The caves {{reflect a}} {{transitional}} style architecture evolved during {{the rule of}} kings Mahendra Varman I and Rajasimha or Narasimhavarman I known as Mamalla and this style was continued by his son Parameshvaravarman I. Historical research has also confirmed that Mahabalipuram town came to be established only after it was named after Mamalla and the caves and rathas are dated to his period during the year 650 AD. That Mahabalipuram was a busy port and prosperous during Mamalla's rule is attested {{by the fact that}} Xuanzang, the Chinese traveller <b>stayed</b> <b>here</b> in 642 AD as a guest of the court recording the greatness of the town and its king. Thirumangai Alvar, a vaishnava saint of Tamil Nadu has also recorded glowingly about the town’s richness as seen from the loaded ships exporting goods. The caves excavated during this period though similar to the earlier caves but were more sophisticated in their decorations. The Varaha Cave temple or Mandapa has fluted columns separating the openings. Certain Greco-Roman architectural styles could also be discerned and the sitting statues are said to have likeness to the sitting styles seen in European architecture, as against the Indian cross legged style. The style thus created at Mahabalipuram became a forerunner for Dravidian style of architecture. The Pallavas were great patrons of art.|$|E
