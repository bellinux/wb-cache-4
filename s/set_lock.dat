40|$|Queue-based spin locks allow {{programs}} with busy-wait syn-chronization to scale to very large multiprocessors, {{without fear of}} starvation or performance-destroying contention. So-called try locks, traditionally based on non-scalable test-and-set locks, allow a process to abandon its attempt to acquire a lock after a given amount of time. The process can then pursue an alternative code path, or yield the processor to some other process. We demonstrate {{that it is possible}} to obtain both scal-ability and bounded waiting, using variants of the queue-based locks of Craig, Landin, and Hagersten, and of Mellor-Crummey and Scott. A process that decides to stop waiting for one of these new locks can “link itself out of line ” atomi-cally. Single-processor experiments reveal performance penal-ties of 50 – 100 % for the CLH and MCS try locks in compar-ison to their standard versions; this marginal cost decreases with larger numbers of processors. We have also compared our queue-based locks to a tradi-tional test-and-test and <b>set</b> <b>lock</b> with exponential backoff and timeout. At modest (non-zero) levels of contention, the queued locks sacrifice cache locality for fairness, result-ing in a worst-case 3 X performance penalty. At high levels of contention, however, they display a 1. 5 – 2 X performance advantage, with significantly more regular timings and sig-nificantly higher rates of acquisition prior to timeout. 1...|$|E

50|$|A {{master key}} {{operates}} a <b>set</b> of several <b>locks.</b> Usually, {{there is nothing}} special about the key itself, but rather the locks into which it will fit. These master-keyed locks are configured to operate with two, or more, different keys: one specific to each lock (the change key), which cannot operate {{any of the others}} in the set, and the master key, which operates all the <b>locks</b> in the <b>set.</b> <b>Locks</b> that have master keys have a second set of the mechanism used to operate them that is identical to all of the others in the <b>set</b> of <b>locks.</b> For example, master keyed pin tumbler locks often have two shear points at each pin position, one for the change key and one for the master key. A far more secure (and more expensive) system has two cylinders in each lock, one for the change key and one for the master key.|$|R

25|$|An {{example of}} a {{practical}} application involving the hitting set problem arises in efficient dynamic detection of race conditions. In this case, each time global memory is written, the current thread and <b>set</b> of <b>locks</b> held by that thread are stored. Under lockset-based detection, if later another thread writes to that location {{and there is not}} a race, it must be because it holds at least one lock in common with each of the previous writes. Thus the size of the hitting set represents the minimum <b>lock</b> <b>set</b> size to be race-free. This is useful in eliminating redundant write events, since large <b>lock</b> <b>sets</b> are considered unlikely in practice.|$|R
50|$|Another {{effective}} way of implementing synchronization is by using spinlocks. Before accessing any shared resource or piece of code, every processor checks a flag. If the flag is reset, then the processor sets the flag and continues executing the thread. But, if the flag is <b>set</b> (<b>locked),</b> the threads would keep spinning in a loop and keep checking if the flag is set or not. But, spinlocks are effective only if the flag is reset for lower cycles otherwise {{it can lead to}} performance issues as it wastes many processor cycles waiting.|$|R
