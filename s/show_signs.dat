5|$|Almost all {{the rocks}} show {{evidence}} of impact process effects. Many samples {{appear to be}} pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters, which is never seen on Earth rocks, due to the thick atmosphere.

Some of the returned samples are of impact melt (materials melted near an impact crater.) All samples returned from the Moon are highly brecciated {{as a result of}} being subjected to multiple impact events.|$|E

The Paramahamsas do not carry {{articles}} or <b>show</b> <b>signs</b> that suggest they have renounced, their conduct is concealed, they may only seem insane.

5|$|Unlike normal mice, {{transgenic}} poliovirus receptor (TgPVR) mice {{are susceptible}} to poliovirus injected intravenously or intramuscularly, and when injected directly into the spinal cord or the brain.

5|$|A {{specimen}} of Pinacosaurus preserves large paraglossalia (triangular bones or cartilages {{located in the}} tongue) which <b>show</b> <b>signs</b> of muscular stress, and it is {{thought this was a}} common feature of ankylosaurs. The researchers who examined the specimen suggested that ankylosaurs relied heavily on muscular tongues and hyobranchia (tongue bones) when feeding, since their teeth were fairly small and were replaced at a relatively slow rate. Some modern salamanders have similar tongue bones, and use prehensile tongues to pick up food. Based on the broadness of the ribcage, Ankylosaurus may have digested through a hindgut fermentation system like modern herbivorous lizards, which have several chambers in their enlarged colon.|$|E
5|$|All major moons {{comprise}} {{approximately equal}} amounts rock and ice, except Miranda, {{which is made}} primarily of ice. The ice component may include ammonia and carbon dioxide. Their surfaces are heavily cratered, though all of them (except Umbriel) <b>show</b> <b>signs</b> of endogenic resurfacing {{in the form of}} lineaments (canyons) and, in the case of Miranda, ovoid race-track like structures called coronae. Extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are likely responsible for the origin of the coronae. Ariel appears to have the youngest surface with the fewest impact craters, while Umbriel's appears oldest. A past 3:1 orbital resonance between Miranda and Umbriel and a past 4:1 resonance between Ariel and Titania are thought to be responsible for the heating that caused substantial endogenic activity on Miranda and Ariel.|$|E
5|$|Anthropologists {{are also}} able to see other markers present on the bones. Past {{fractures}} will be evident {{by the presence of}} bone remodeling. The examination of any fractures on the bones can potentially help determine cause of death as well by determining if a fracture occurred ante-mortem (before death), peri-mortem (at the time of death), or post-mortem (after death). Ante-mortem fractures will <b>show</b> <b>signs</b> of healing while peri- and post-mortem fractures will not. Peri-mortem fractures will usually appear clean while post-mortem breaks will appear brittle. Diseases such as bone cancer might be present in bone marrow samples and can help narrow down the list of possible identifications.|$|E

5|$|Most modern {{historians have}} exonerated Robert Dudley from murder or a cover-up. Apart from {{alternatives}} for a murder plot as causes for Amy Robsart's death, his correspondence with Thomas Blount and William Cecil {{in the days}} following has been cited as proofs of his innocence; the letters, which <b>show</b> <b>signs</b> of an agitated mind, making clear his bewilderment and unpreparedness. It has also been judged as highly unlikely that he would have orchestrated the death of his wife in a manner which laid him open to such a foreseeable scandal.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{concealed}} shoes {{found to}} date {{are made of}} leather, but wooden clogs and rubber galoshes have also been reported, among others. The overwhelming majority (almost 98 per cent) have been worn, and many <b>show</b> <b>signs</b> of repair. All ages are represented in the shoe sizes, from babies to adults, {{but there is little}} difference in the ratio of adult male to female shoes, at 21.5 per cent and 26.5 per cent respectively. Most finds are of single shoes, but some pairs have also been discovered. About half of the shoes so far discovered belonged to children.|$|E
5|$|Saturn (9.5AU), {{distinguished}} by its extensive ring system, has several similarities to Jupiter, {{such as its}} atmospheric composition and magnetosphere. Although Saturn has 60% of Jupiter's volume, it {{is less than a}} third as massive, at 95 Earth masses. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water. The rings of Saturn are made up of small ice and rock particles. Saturn has 62 confirmed satellites composed largely of ice. Two of these, Titan and Enceladus, <b>show</b> <b>signs</b> of geological activity. Titan, the second-largest moon in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury and the only satellite in the Solar System with a substantial atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|While Jardine won {{the series}} as captain, he contributed just 199 runs {{at an average}} of 22.11 in the Tests, and 628 runs (average 36.94) in all {{first-class}} cricket in Australia. Jardine only played in the first Test of the short series which followed in New Zealand, due to rheumatism. All the players enjoyed the short tour although rain ruined the cricket, and Jardine was observed to <b>show</b> <b>signs</b> of paranoia towards all things Australian. Pelham Warner, although he later stated that he disapproved of Bodyline bowling, praised Jardine's captaincy on the tour and believed that he was cruelly treated by the Australian crowds. He further believed that Jardine was convinced that the tactics were legitimate.|$|E
5|$|A herbivorous species, Bagheera kiplingi, was {{described}} in 2008, but all other known species are predators, mostly preying on insects and on other spiders, although a few large species also take birds and lizards. It is estimated that the world's 25 million tons of spiders kill 400–800 million tons of prey per year. Spiders use {{a wide range of}} strategies to capture prey: trapping it in sticky webs, lassoing it with sticky bolas, mimicking the prey to avoid detection, or running it down. Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations, but the active hunters have acute vision, and hunters of the genus Portia <b>show</b> <b>signs</b> of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones. Spiders' guts are too narrow to take solids, and they liquefy their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes. They also grind food with the bases of their pedipalps, as arachnids do not have the mandibles that crustaceans and insects have.|$|E
5|$|A {{reduction}} in fracture toughness {{may also be}} attributed to the embrittlement effect of impurities, or for body-centred cubic metals, from a {{reduction in}} temperature. Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch-ductility while below this range the material becomes brittle. Within the range, the materials behavior is unpredictable. The reduction in fracture toughness is accompanied by a change in the fracture appearance. When above the transition, the fracture is primarily due to micro-void coalescence, which results in the fracture appearing fibrous. When the temperatures falls the fracture will <b>show</b> <b>signs</b> of cleavage facets. These two appearances are visible by the naked eye. Brittle fracture in steel plates may appear as chevron markings under the microscope. These arrow-like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the fracture.|$|E
