40|$|Barrett's {{esophagus}} is the metaplastic {{change of}} the squamous epithelium lining the distal esophagus into an intestinalized columnar epithelium that predisposes to esophageal adenocarcinoma development. The cell that gives rise to Barrett's esophagus has not been identified definitively, although several sources for the Barrett's esophagus cell of origin have been postulated. One possible source is a fully differentiated <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> or a squamous epithelial progenitor or stem cell native to the esophagus that, through molecular reprogramming, either transdifferentiation or transcommitment, could give rise to an intestinalized columnar cell. Multilayered epithelium found in human patients and rodents with Barrett's esophagus and direct phenotypic conversion of mouse embryonic esophageal epithelium provide support for this.

40|$|E-cadherin is a transmembrane {{glycoprotein}} that mediates calcium- dependent, homotypic {{cell-cell adhesion}} and {{plays an important}} role in maintaining the normal phenotype of epithelial cells. Disruption of E- cadherin activity in epithelial cells correlates with formation of metastatic tumors. Decreased adhesive function may be implemented in a number of ways including: (a) decreased expression of E-cadherin; (b) mutations in the gene encoding E-cadherin; or (c) mutations in the genes that encode the catenins, proteins that link the cadherins to the cytoskeleton and are essential for cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion. In this study, we explored the possibility that inappropriate expression of a nonepithelial cadherin by an epithelial cell might also result in disruption of cell-cell adhesion. We showed that a squamous cell carcinoma-derived cell line expressed N-cadherin and displayed a scattered fibroblastic phenotype along with decreased expression of E- and P-cadherin. Transfection of this cell line with antisense N- cadherin resulted in reversion to a normal-appearing <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> with increased E- and P-cadherin expression. In addition, transfection of a normal-appearing <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> line with N-cadherin resulted in downregulation of both E- and P- cadherin and a scattered fibroblastic phenotype. In all cases, the levels of expression of N-cadherin and E-cadherin were inversely related to one another. In addition, we showed that some squamous cell carcinomas expressed N-cadherin in situ and those tumors expressing N- cadherin were invasive. These studies led us to propose a novel mechanism for tumorigenesis in squamous epithelial cells; i. e., inadvertent expression of a nonepithelial cadherin...|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus asymptomatically colonises the {{anterior}} nares, but the host and bacterial factors that facilitate colonisation remain incompletely understood. The S. aureus surface protein ClfB {{has been shown}} to mediate adherence to squamous epithelial cells in vitro and to promote nasal colonisation in both mice and humans. Here, we demonstrate that the <b>squamous</b> <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> envelope protein loricrin represents the major target ligand for ClfB during S. aureus nasal colonisation. In vitro adherence assays indicated that bacteria expressing ClfB bound loricrin most likely by the "dock, lock and latch" mechanism. Using surface plasmon resonance we showed that ClfB bound cytokeratin 10 (K 10), a structural protein of squamous epithelial cells, and loricrin with similar affinities that were in the low ?M range. Loricrin is composed of three separate regions comprising GS-rich omega loops. Each loop was expressed separately and found to bind ClfB, However region 2 bound with highest affinity. To investigate if the specific interaction between ClfB and loricrin was sufficient to facilitate S. aureus nasal colonisation, we compared the ability of ClfB+ S. aureus to colonise the nares of wild-type and loricrin-deficient (Lor-/-) mice. In the absence of loricrin, S. aureus nasal colonisation was significantly impaired. Furthermore a ClfB- mutant colonised wild-type mice less efficiently than the parental ClfB+ strain whereas a similar lower level of colonisation was observed with both the parental strain and the ClfB- mutant in the Lor-/- mice. The ability of ClfB to support nasal colonisation by binding loricrin in vivo was confirmed by the ability of Lactococcus lactis expressing ClfB to be retained in the nares of WT mice but not in the Lor-/- mice.

EC {{is involved in the}} immune and inflammatory response, coagulation, growth regulation, production of extracellular matrix components, and is a modulator of blood flow and blood vessel tone. EC injury, activation, or dysfunction is a hallmark of many pathologic states including atherosclerosis, loss of semi-permeable membrane function, and thrombosis [25]. A wide variety of stimuli can induce programmed cell death (apoptosis) of endothelial cells through extrinsic (death receptor) and/or intrinsic (mitochondria) apoptotic pathway, which is ultimately executed by the intracellular proteases called caspases. There also exist caspase-independent pathways of apoptosis and anti-apoptotic proteins, which can protect cells from apoptosis.
