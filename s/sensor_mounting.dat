It would need to run on a low power supply and it would also need to be selective to flammable gas only, with no cross interference from factors such as humidity or temperature.|$|E

Variable rate fertilization requires quantification of grass growth level. Objective {{of this study}} was to compare the performance of potential sensors under different growth levels and sensor operation conditions. A CCD camera, an ultrasonic module, and an optical reflectance sensor (i. e., Crop Circle) were tested at fields with different grass growth levels. Effects of <b>sensor</b> <b>mounting</b> height and angle were investigated. Effects of vehicle (i. e., mower tractor) vibration and traveling were also investigated: under static, vibration and no traveling, and vibration with traveling conditions. Results showed that <b>sensor</b> <b>mounting</b> height had a little effect on the sensor performance, and grass growth level was successfully quantified. Camera angle of 90 ° showed the best performance with less noise. The ultrasonic sensor could work with less deviation under static condition, whereas, CCD camera proved the applicability under all operating conditions. Operation condition of the optical reflectance sensor showed a little effect on the grass growth detection results.

40|$|Abstract: Precision {{positioning}} {{and manipulation}} systems often rely {{on data from}} sensors delivering a sinusoidal signal pair. These signals can be interpolated to provide a high resolution measurement. The paper presents a novel method for removing signal differences and drifts by automatic self-calibrating the sinusoidal signal pair. Then, manual calibration is avoided and slow varying effects, like thermal drifts or imprecise <b>sensor</b> <b>mounting,</b> can be effectively compensated. The proposed method can be implemented on a DSP. It uses an on-line gradient search to minimize a given performance index. Copyright c© 2005 IFA...|$|E

40|$|The Kohonen {{self-organizing}} map (KN) {{was developed for}} pattern recognition, and has been extended to fault classification. However, the KN {{cannot be applied to}} classify faults from the system output if it contains other factors, such as system state and <b>sensor</b> <b>mounting</b> errors. To overcome this problem, a constrained KN (CKN) is proposed. To eliminate the effect of the system state and the mounting errors, it is proposed that the weight vectors of the CKN are constrained in the parity space. The training algorithm of the CKN is derived, and its convergence discussed. Application of the CKN to fault classification is presented, and its performance is illustrated by an example involving a redundant sensor system with six sensors. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|For {{a system}} with {{redundant}} sensors, the estimated state from the Kalman filter is biased if <b>sensor</b> <b>mounting</b> error existed. To remove this bias, the mounting errors must be compensated first before using the Kalman filter. It is shown that only the projection part of the sensors errors in the measurement space needs to be compensated. If the state of a system is unavailable, a neurofuzzy network {{can be used to}} estimate the compensation term. This method is simpler, as it does not require a model for the errors as that proposed in [2]. A sub-optimal Kalman filter with measurement compensation that restrains each row of the Kalman gain matrix to be in the measurement space is also derived. An example is presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed methods. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
30|$|Both magnetometers {{sample the}} {{magnetic}} field at 1 Hz and are synchronized to GPS timing, so no time base correction on the data is required. In order to correct for visible curvature in the original NPM data, second order polynomial curves were fitted to the NPM data. Subtracting the fit curve from the original data yields a flatter data set. Given that the instrument is a technology demonstrator, the <b>sensor</b> <b>mounting</b> hardware consists of a wooden plank with orthogonally oriented grooves for the sensors to sit in and fastened with plastic cable ties. We attribute some very small differences to sensor misalignment. In principle, a rotation of axes could be done mathematically to correct this. What we regard as more important is that small perturbations show {{a high degree of}} similarity between the NPM and SMALL instruments.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{individual}} vehicle traffic is often disturbed by traffic stockings. The expected increase of {{traffic on the}} roads cannot be handled by building further lanes or completely new roads.

For this reason highly reliable traffic detection systems for a reasonable price of installation and maintenance are required. A new promising approach is the magnetic traffic detection that uses the influence of the vehicles steel mass on the earth magnetic field. A prototype of this system has been realized which is capable to measure the traffic from an overhead position through a distance of at least six meters.
