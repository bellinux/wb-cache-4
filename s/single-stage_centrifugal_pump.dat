30|$|Nevertheless, {{the absence}} of {{consolidated}} approaches in this field implied that a similar technology still today can be reputed only a scientific exercise, although there are numerous studies conducted also on experimental sites [9, 10, 11]. Pumps manufactures, indeed, usually do not provide information about efficiency of a pump used like a turbine. Various researchers indicated the <b>single-stage</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pumps</b> as the optimal and most convenient choice for a PAT, operating, however, in a range from low-to-medium head [12, 13, 14, 15]. However, most of tests and experiments were conducted on horizontal single-stage pumps, although different types of pumps are available like multi-stage, vertical pumps, etc. Despite the numerous models and equations able to define the efficiency of a pump used in a reverse mode, this issue is still open and the efficiency of a pump when operating as turbine remains the main criticism that limits their application [16]. Moreover, experimental investigations are carried out to improve the PAT performances modifying impeller diameter and rotational speed. A simple reshaping of the blades of the impeller (with a blade rounding) can increase the PAT performances; in the same way, the greater size of the impeller increases its performances, due to {{the absence of}} a lateral passageway for the turbinated water (differently that in pump mode) and to a refinement of the inlet and outlet parts [17].|$|R

40|$|Pumps are an {{integral}} part of engineering systems used in power and process industries. Flow through the centrifugal pump is very complex mainly due to the rotation imposed by the impeller and its interaction with the volute casing. Performance and condition monitoring of pumps are important to identify decreased performance, to avoid unplanned shut downs, to predict and plan preventive maintenance, and to enhance service life. Cavitation has direct influence on operating stability and service life of centrifugal pump. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique is emerging as a useful computational tool for the prediction of pump performance and occurrence of cavitation at different flow conditions. In this work, three-dimensional steady-state analysis of a <b>single-stage</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pump</b> with three backward curved blades and a double volute casing has been carried out using Ansys-CFX.

The diffusion coefficient d is an important parameter in fluid machinery but it has seldom {{been used in the}} diffuser design of single-stage centrifugal pumps.

The flow area decreases and the flow velocity at radial diffuser outlet increase when the outlet thickness is greater than 2 mm. The hydraulic loss is minimum and the head and efficiency are better when the vane number is 8 at different flow rates.

The measurements were conducted {{inside one of the}} ten curved diffuser channels on the <b>single-stage</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pump</b> test rig located at the Water Power Laboratory at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The measuring technique used during the experiment was laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), providing velocity data with a high spatial resolution and accuracy. Procedures for operating the test rig and the LDV system are included in the thesis. Detailed quantification of the two-dimensional steady flow is represented as the ensemble-averaged velocity and the root-mean-square (RMS) of the velocity fluctuations at design point and off-design point. Visualization of the flow properties are presented as velocity magnitude plots and velocity vector plots. The results show a well-behaved flow without flow separation at the diffuser walls when operating at design point and off-design point. However, the flow appears to be highly three-dimensional and fluctuating throughout the entire diffuser channel, which is expected in a curved diffuser. The main characteristic of the observed flow is a high velocity core near the concave wall, persisting until the outlet of the diffuser channel. Also a near-stagnation condition of the flow in a low velocity region near the convex wall is observed. The velocity fluctuation distribution has a characteristic S-shape in the upstream part of the diffuser with peak values located at high viscous shear stress zones, while in the downstream part it is uniformly distributed. The results show an overall good repeatability, especially for the downstream part of the diffuser channel, while the data acquired in the upstream part are more scattered. As the purpose of this thesis is to compare the measured velocity data with a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation, the reliability of the data is paramount. Based on the evaluation of the experimental setup and the uncertainty analysis presented in this thesis, the results are concluded to be suited for the intended purpose...|$|E
