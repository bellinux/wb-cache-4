25|$|Firstly, if the omniscient mean {{is unknown}} (and is {{computed}} as the sample mean), then the sample variance is a biased estimator: it underestimates the variance {{by a factor}} of (n−1) / n; correcting by this factor (dividing by n−1 instead of n) is called Bessel's correction. The resulting estimator is unbiased, and is called the (corrected) sample variance or unbiased sample variance. For example, when n=1 the variance of a <b>single</b> <b>observation</b> about the sample mean (itself) is obviously zero regardless of the population variance. If the mean is determined in some other way than from the same samples used to estimate the variance then this bias does not arise and the variance can safely be estimated as that of the samples about the (independently known) mean.|$|E

2500|$|The first ABC-related ideas {{date back}} to the 1980s. Donald Rubin, when {{discussing}} the interpretation of Bayesian statements in 1984, described a hypothetical sampling mechanism that yields a sample from the posterior distribution. This scheme was more of a conceptual thought experiment to demonstrate what type of manipulations are done when inferring the posterior distributions of parameters. The description of the sampling mechanism coincides exactly with that of the ABC-rejection scheme, and this article can be considered {{to be the first to}} describe approximate Bayesian computation. However, a two-stage quincunx was constructed by Francis Galton in the late 1800s that can be seen as a physical implementation of an ABC-rejection scheme for a single unknown (parameter) and a <b>single</b> <b>observation</b> - see figure 5 in [...] Another prescient point was made by Rubin when he argued that in Bayesian inference, applied statisticians should not settle for analytically tractable models only, but instead consider computational methods that allow them to estimate the posterior distribution of interest. This way, a wider range of models can be considered. These arguments are particularly relevant in the context of ABC.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{recorded}} observation of Io {{was made by}} Tuscan astronomer Galileo Galilei on January 7, 1610 using a 20x-power, refracting telescope at the University of Padua in the Republic of Venice. The discovery {{was made possible by}} the invention of the telescope in the Netherlands {{a little more than a}} year earlier and by Galileo's innovations to improve the magnification of the new instrument. During his observation of Jupiter on the evening of January 7, Galileo spotted two stars to the east of Jupiter and another one to the west. Jupiter and these three stars appeared to be in a line parallel to the ecliptic. The star furthest to the east from Jupiter turned out to be Callisto while the star to the west of Jupiter was Ganymede. The third star, the closest one to the east of Jupiter, was a combination of the light from Io and Europa as Galileo's telescope, while having a high magnification for a telescope from his time, was too low-powered to separate the two moons into distinct points of light. Galileo observed Jupiter the next evening, January 8, 1610, this time seeing three stars to the west of Jupiter, suggesting that Jupiter had moved to the west of the three stars. During this observation, the three stars in a line to the west of Jupiter were (from east to west): Io, Europa, and Ganymede. This was the first time that Io and Europa were observed and recorded as distinct points of light so this date, January 8, 1610 is used as the discovery date for the two moons by the International Astronomical Union. Galileo continued to observe the Jupiter system for the next month and a half. On January 13, Galileo observed all four of what would later be known as the Galilean moons of Jupiter for the first time in a <b>single</b> <b>observation,</b> though he had observed all four at various times in the preceding days. On January 15, he observed the motions of three of these satellites, including Io, and came to the conclusions that these objects were not background stars, but were in fact, [...] "three stars in the heavens moving about Jupiter, as Venus and Mercury round the Sun." [...] These were the first moons of a planet other than the Earth to be discovered.|$|E
