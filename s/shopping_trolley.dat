5|$|After {{his arrival}} in Walford, AJ's brother Masood (Nitin Ganatra) makes sure he avoids his ex-wife Zainab (Nina Wadia), because she dislikes him. AJ proves {{to be a bad}} {{influence}} on Masood when they damage Derek Branning's (Jamie Foreman) car with a <b>shopping</b> <b>trolley</b> and AJ is punched by Derek. AJ discovers that Masood and Zainab are divorced and later tells Masood he came to Walford because his wife Aliyah (Ann Wenn) has left him. After Masood inspires AJ with his reunion with Zainab, AJ leaves to reconcile with his own wife. He returns a few weeks later saying that he and Aliyah are divorcing. Zainab contacts Aliyah to try to get her to take AJ back, and AJ says that Aliyah had an affair. Aliyah drops off AJ's belongings and reveals that there was no affair. AJ then explains that he left Aliyah because she wants children and he does not. AJ moves in with Masood and his family. Zainab dislikes his laziness and she becomes annoyed when he brings Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) back after a drunken evening. Roxy stays the night but makes it clear that it was a one-off.|$|E
25|$|Result: Both teams {{wanted a}} {{designer}} <b>shopping</b> <b>trolley,</b> but Kinetic won it after Lewis unwittingly sabotaged Atomic's pitch by asking irrelevant questions and behaving in an unprofessional manner. Kinetic therefore got the trolley and a handheld vacuum cleaner, while Atomic chose a pie making machine and a bird {{house with a}} built-in camera (Harry M. and Hayley wanted an inflatable support pillow, but Haya ignored them). Both teams struggled to sell {{in the first half}} of the day, and had to resort to cutting prices as the day went on. The standout performers were Harry H. and Lizzie on Kinetic, who overcame their lack of a discount with very effective product demonstrations of the vacuum cleaner, and Harry M. on Atomic, who single-handedly made almost half of his team's revenue by selling five bird boxes at the end of the day. Kinetic won out with a profit of £1,138.77, largely due to Harry H. and Lizzie's work with the vacuum cleaners, while Atomic suffered their fourth successive defeat, raising just £847.42.|$|E

At around the same time, the [...] "Production" [...] consumer co-operative, based in Hamburg, ordered 40 trolleys and 100 hand baskets for the opening of Germany's first self-service shop. At the start of the 1950s, Rudolf Wanzl travelled to the United States where he met Sylvan Goldman, inventor of the <b>shopping</b> <b>trolley.</b> On the return flight he had already designed his own more manoeuvrable version, which became the model for all shopping trolleys in use today.
