5|$|Keith {{finds out}} that Selma might have {{disappeared}} {{to get away from}} her husband. Veronica shows Wallace the Roman numerals, and they deduce that it is a date, and Veronica learns that a sorority house member died on that day. Veronica confronts a sorority girl about the dead member, and she implies that others believe that <b>something</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> her. After finding out that leaving her husband after ten years would be beneficial to Selma, Veronica and Keith break into the Roses’ house and find Selma on the couch. Selma tells the pair why she has “disappeared”: Mr. Rose is trying to scam her for more money and has blackmailed her with knowledge of a lesbian affair with her dog walker.|$|E
5|$|A final {{reason for}} the Second Settlement was to give the Principate {{constitutional}} stability and staying power in case <b>something</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Princeps Augustus. His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin thread {{of the life of}} one man, Augustus himself, who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life. If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid {{in the minds of many}} citizens. Proconsular imperium was conferred upon Agrippa for five years, similar to Augustus' power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus' imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas.|$|E

With both Atlantis and Endeavour on the pads, it was the 18th time that two flight-ready orbiters were in position at both launch pads at the same time.|$|E

25|$|His journey {{started when}} {{he studied the}} Qur'an in a literal way, and he slowly began to {{understand}} the principles lined in the religion. Then <b>something</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him in America to remove his doubts. He says; {{that while he was}} going to America, he was on the boat (ferry), and he saw the way the boat he was travelling in – was rocking in the huge sea – all under the control of Allah without it sinking or capsizing. At that point he realized the power of Allah. He said Iman (belief) entered into his heart due to this. His second scenario was in San Francisco, when he went on top of a mountain, and he could see the whole of creation in front of him, and he realized the beauty and harmony that existed amongst the creation as a whole. He said that, the sweetness of Iman hit him.|$|E
25|$|The {{lyrics and}} storyline {{of the musical}} are based on Mary Main's biography, , which drew heavily upon the {{accounts}} of anti-Perónist Argentines. Shortly after the musical appeared, Nicholas Fraser and Marysa Navarro published a more neutral account of Eva Perón's life, Evita: The Real Lives of Eva Perón, in which they claim that many of Main's assertions (which had influenced Rice's lyrics) were false, such as the suggestion that Eva had first gone to Buenos Aires as the mistress of a married musician, Agustín Magaldi. Instead, they wrote, Eva's mother Doña Juana had taken her there when she aspired to become a radio actress. Some critics also suggested that Rice's lyrics disparaged Evita's achievements unnecessarily, particularly her charity work. According to Navarro and Fraser, was based {{for the most part}} on the earliest and seamiest versions of Evita's life, <b>something</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the tale in its retelling and the Evita who emerged each evening, dressed first as a teenager, then a hooker, and finally, in tulle and silver foil, as First Lady, was far from being unsympathetic.|$|E
25|$|Folk {{dancing is}} a strong {{influence}} {{in many of the}} books. From Girls of the Hamlet Club (1914) and At School with the Roundheads (1915) until The Girls of the Abbey School (1921), it was shown as a fairly easy thing for girls to do, and to teach each other. By the time of The Abbey Girls Go Back to School (1922) it is apparent that Oxenham herself had come into contact with the English Folk Dance Society and realised that the dances were not so simple after all. The books written from this time for the next six years or so, until Abbey Girls Win Through (1928) depict members of the EFDS hierarchy with affection and almost reverence. It seems that <b>something</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> spoil this relationship, as after 1930 these characters do not appear in the books, and are hardly referred to again, certainly not in such glowing terms. The EFDS makes a brief appearance in An Abbey Champion (1946), but the personnel are no longer named. It may have been as simple as the move to Worthing and the impossibility of maintaining as close a friendship at a distance of some sixty miles, but it has been conjectured that 'Madam' (Helen Kennedy North) and 'The Pixie' (Daisy Caroline Daking) may have objected to the way they were being portrayed. Oxenham never lost the love of folk dancing itself, however, and always shows it as a healthy form of exercise, and a way of lifting oneself out of depression.|$|E

I just want something to be done." [...] She decides to find the murderer on her own. When MacLeod tells Tessa that she is stronger than Anne, and that if <b>something</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him she would be fine, Tessa retorts, [...] "You only think so because it suits you." [...] The murderer is Chief Police Officer Andrew Ballin (Tom Butler) who is beheaded by MacLeod after Ballin failed to kill Tessa.|$|E
500|$|His {{orders to}} be sent to Vietnam were [...] "held up" [...] for some time, and the Gore family {{suspected}} that this was due to a fear by the Nixon administration that if <b>something</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him, his father would gain sympathy votes. He was finally shipped to Vietnam on January 2, 1971, after his father had lost his seat in the Senate during the 1970 Senate election, becoming one [...] "of only about a dozen of the 1,115 Harvard graduates in the Class of '69 who went to Vietnam." [...] Gore was stationed with the 20th Engineer Brigade in Bien Hoa and was a journalist with The Castle Courier. He received an honorable discharge from the Army in May 1971.|$|E
500|$|The {{so-called}} [...] "cyber-kidnapping" [...] {{portrayed in}} [...] "Weeping Willow" [...] {{is believed to}} be the first such crime ever portrayed on television. While the writers and producers prepared the episode, several district attorneys they consulted said the law was dangerously vague regarding what charges could be filed in the event of such a real-life cyber-kidnapping; Wright said, [...] "They told me that this is a real problem, that there's a lag between what's on the books now and what's happening out there." [...] The script also includes a difficulty on the part of the detectives in coping and dealing this new form of cyber-crime and differentiating the truth from the hoax; Leight said, [...] "Their biggest frustration is trying to understand what's real and what isn't. Does this woman, Willow, really exist, and has <b>something</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> her? Is she playing a character and a game that's gotten out of hand? And how do you locate someone in cyberspace?" ...|$|E

500|$|It was {{announced}} on 7 November 2007 that Abra would again {{be returning to}} Holby City, in spring 2008. Edmondson revealed that [...] "Abra comes back as a patient because some trauma has happened in Africa {{and he will be}} sponging off Ric." [...] Expanding on this, he explained: [...] "Abra’s in a very fragile state, as he’s suffering from post-traumatic stress. He keeps hurting himself, but no one knows why. Ric’s pretty off with Abra at first, but he agrees to let him stay at his place for a week. Abra used to be a nice guy, but he’s horrible now. <b>Something</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him on his travels, though even I haven’t been told what it is yet. What I do know is that Abra has a huge machete scar on his back... I imagine he’s been though some horror." [...] He has stated that this appearance in the show will last four or five months, and that he doesn't yet know how the character will be written out this time, beyond there being [...] "some kind of mental-health issue." [...] It emerged that Abra had borne witness to a violent attack on the hospital he was working in the Congo, eventually leading to him checking into a psychiatric unit. After being discovered being treated by his own mother, Kyla and Lola Griffin convinced him to discharge himself and return to Ghana. He returned briefly to Holby in December 2008, when he convinced Kyla to move to Ghana with him, proposing marriage to her.|$|E
2500|$|While {{working on}} methods of {{recovering}} sulphur dioxide from copper smelter gases, <b>something</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> recall his favorite experiment at the University of Chicago. A Pittsburgh newspaper account (no exact reference) of action near Ypres, Belgium,, in 1915 actually was what led Dr. Garner toward his most notable scientific contribution. [...] The article quoted a Cap. Bertram of the Eighty Canadian Battalion who reported 'a white smoke {{arising from the}} German trenches to a height of about 3 feet. [...] Then, {{in front of the}} white smoke appeared a greenish cloud which drifted along the ground to our trenches, to rising more than about 7 feet from the ground. [...] Men in the trenches were obliged to leave and a number of them were killed by the effects of the gas.|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{versions}} of why Horne ended the hunger strike. Mann writes that Horne called it off without explanation two days after being moved back to prison, and was promptly returned to the hospital. The media reported that a Labour MP had arranged for Michael Banner, {{the chair of the}} Animal Procedures Committee, to agree to attend a meeting with Ian Cawsey, head of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Animal Welfare, to discuss animal testing practices in the UK. This was interpreted by Horne as a concession {{on the part of the}} government, and he agreed to start eating again on 13 December 1998. His friends suspect that <b>something</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him during the two days he was back in Full Sutton out of contact with them. Mann writes: [...] "Whatever happened to him between leaving the hospital and returning to prison may never be known, but all those close to him suspect something did and he was never the same again." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Eye in the Door concentrates, for {{the most}} part, on Rivers' {{treatment}} of the fictional character of Prior. Although Prior's character may not have existed, the facts that he makes Rivers face up to did – that <b>something</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him {{on the first floor}} of his house that caused him to block all visual memory and begin to stammer. We also learn of Rivers' treatment of officers in the airforce and of his work with Head. Sassoon too plays a role in the book- Rivers visits him in hospital where he finds him to be a different, if not broken, man, his attempt at 'suicide' having failed. This second novel in the trilogy, both implicitly and directly, addresses the issue of Rivers' possible homosexuality and attraction to Sassoon. From Rivers' reaction to finding out that Sassoon is in hospital to the song playing in the background ('You Made Me Love You') and Ruth Head's question to her husband, [...] "Do you think he's in love with him?" [...] we get a strong impression of the author's opinions on Rivers' sexuality.|$|E
2500|$|Mathis {{had worn}} his trunks very high, {{so that when}} Joe hit Mathis with {{legitimate}} body shots, the referee took {{a dim view of}} them. In the second round, the referee had {{gone so far as to}} penalize Joe two points for hitting below the belt. [...] "In a three-round bout a man can't afford a points deduction like that," [...] Joe would say. Joe then returned to Philadelphia feeling as low as he'd ever been and was even thinking of giving up boxing. Duke Dugent and his trainer Yank Durham were able to talk Joe out of his doldrums and even suggested Joe make the trip to Tokyo as an alternate, in case <b>something</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Mathis. Joe agreed and while there, he was a workhorse, sparring with any of the Olympic boxers who wanted some action. [...] "Middleweight, light heavyweight, it didn't matter to me, I got in there and boxed all comers" [...] Joe would say. In contrast, Mathis was slacking off. In the morning, when the Olympic team would do their roadwork, Mathis would run a mile, then start walking saying [...] "Go ahead, big Joe. I'll catch up." [...] His amateur record was 38–2.|$|E
