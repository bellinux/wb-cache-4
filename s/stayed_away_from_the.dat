Vale were beaten 5–0 by Rotherham United {{in his first game}} in charge, but rallied to beat Burton Albion 2–1, before Jim Gannon was appointed manager. Gannon retained Horsfield as his assistant. On the way to a match at Aldershot on 25 February, Gannon left the team bus after an apparent bust-up with Horsfield. The national media reported that Gannon granted Horsfield's request for a day off for family reasons but then wrote to the board complaining about his conduct. Having been shown the letter by a director, Horsfield confronted Gannon over the issue. After an internal inquiry, during which Horsfield <b>stayed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> club, no disciplinary action was taken against either party. Gannon was sacked on 21 March, and Grew was appointed as caretaker-manager with Horsfield as his assistant.|$|E

Knighthood of the Kingdom of Poland strengthened for good, and in the battlefield developed and dominated maneuverability, with full scale outflanking, surrounding, unconventional uses of cavalry and infantry units to surprise the enemy. In those days commanders <b>stayed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fight, observing battle from a carefully selected place (mostly {{at the top of the}} hill), from where they had a wide view over the surroundings.

25|$|At Northwestern Law School, Washington was {{the only}} black student in his class (there were six women in the class, one of them being Dawn Clark Netsch). As at Roosevelt, he entered school politics. In 1951, his last year, he was elected {{treasurer}} of the Junior Bar Association (JBA). The election was largely symbolic, however, and Washington's attempts to give the JBA more authority at Northwestern were largely unsuccessful. On campus, Washington joined the Nu Beta Epsilon fraternity, largely because {{he and the other}} minorities which constituted the fraternity were blatantly excluded from the other fraternities on campus. Overall, Washington <b>stayed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> activism that defined his years at Roosevelt. During the evenings and weekends, he worked to supplement his GI Bill income.

500|$|Mentions of {{the theory}} that Jews <b>stayed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> WTC on 9/11, {{and the idea of}} Mossad {{involvement}} in or foreknowledge of the attacks, has led to claims that the book feeds the [...] "new anti-Semitism". A report by the American Jewish Committee accused the book, along with other so-called 9/11 conspiracy literature of 2003, of perpetuating myths and stereotyping Jews as criminal and conspiratorial. The Anti-Defamation League has found evidence of Bülow being cited by anti-Semitic publications and websites keen to link Mossad to the 9/11 attacks.|$|E

500|$|Battlefield Earth was {{released}} on May 12, 2000, and was an immediate critical and commercial failure, frequently described {{as one of the}} worst films of all time. Reviewers panned the film, criticizing virtually every aspect of the production including Travolta's acting, overuse of angled shots and slow-motion, poor script, mediocre special effects, several plot holes and narrative inconsistencies, art direction and dialogue. Audiences were reported to have ridiculed early screenings and <b>stayed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> film after its opening weekend, which led to Battlefield Earth failing to recoup its costs. The film went on to receive a total of eight Golden Raspberry Awards, which until 2012 was the most Razzie Awards given to a single film, additionally winning Worst Picture of the Decade in 2010. It has since become a cult film in the [...] "so bad, it's good" [...] vein.|$|E
500|$|Events at the {{gathering}} have several times resulted in controversies, and clashes between rival political factions. Following the 1981 event, the Catalan parliament president Heribert Barrera, two parliamentary deputies, and several others, faced criminal charges of [...] "insulting the feelings and {{unity of the}} Spanish nation and distributing illegal publications". The charges were dropped after three years. The 1986 gathering was marred by the burning of Spanish flags and harassment of moderate groups. As a result, the mainstream political parties Democratic Convergence and Republican Left <b>stayed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1987 event. In 1988, different factions of the far-left Movement for Defence of the Land (MDT) fought each other. In 1991, MDT militants attacked youth members of Democratic Convergence and Republican Left, and in 1996, hooded left-wing militants came from their assembly at Pi Jove to attack members of Estat Català at Pi Vell.

500|$|Blaine {{began the}} year 1882 without a {{political}} {{office for the}} first time since 1859. Troubled by poor health, he sought no employment other than the completion of the first volume of his memoir, Twenty Years of Congress. Friends in Maine petitioned Blaine to run for Congress in the 1882 elections, but he declined, preferring to spend his time writing and supervising the move to the new home. His income from mining and railroad investments was sufficient to sustain the family’s lifestyle and to allow for the construction of a vacation cottage, “Stanwood" [...] on Mount Desert Island, Maine, designed by Frank Furness. Blaine appeared before Congress in 1882 during an investigation into his War of the Pacific diplomacy, defending himself against allegations that he owned an interest in the Peruvian guano deposits being occupied by Chile, but otherwise <b>stayed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Capitol. The publication of the first volume of Twenty Years in early 1884 added to Blaine’s financial security and thrust him back into the political spotlight. As the 1884 campaign loomed, Blaine’s name was being circulated once more as a potential nominee, and despite some reservations, he soon found himself back in the hunt for the presidency.|$|E
500|$|Nixon infused {{elements}} of those literatures into the Dimitri and Natalie romance with as well. [...] "There's a gothic quality to it", she said, {{referring to the}} couple. [...] "It's Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Everybody loves somebody who has a past and a secret- and certainly Dimitri does- which we haven't divulged yet. That heightens ones interest and suspense. It's a special situation but what really makes it special is the actor's talent, personalities, good looks, and chemistry." [...] Since the writers created Dimitri as a very mysterious character, Michael Nader mostly <b>stayed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> press {{in order to help}} maintain that image. Whenever he did do an interview, he discussed the character {{in such a way as}} to add more mystery. Nader compared Dimitri to the Dynasty character he once portrayed, Dex Dexter. On Dynasty, [...] "John James (Jeff Colby) played the 'aw, shucks;' nice guy, and I played the guy who was on the edge, who would take care of business and not take any bull", he said. [...] "Dimitri is sort of a darker Dex. Though I don't know exactly how dark to make him yet." [...] Nader, as an actor, also provided the writers with more inspiration on the character. [...] "The more we see of him, the more he inspires us", Broderick said. [...] "It's just a wonderful marriage of actor and character He's giving us so many levels and such depth, that it's a challenge. But it's exciting. Dimitri is one of the characters that is so much fun to write." ...|$|E
500|$|Williams {{was then}} {{confirmed}} {{to play against}} England at Swansea on 12 January in a team much changed from that which was beaten by South Africa the previous month. The London Express commented that neither he nor Maddock on the other wing, had much merit, but were selected {{for a lack of}} choice, the whole team being unexceptional. Welsh spectators, expecting defeat {{at the hands of the}} English, <b>stayed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> game, and only 5,000 turned out, a record low for international rugby in Wales. But the headline in the 'Pink Edition' of the Evening Express read [...] "St George Routed", as Wales beat England 22–0. Right from the start, the Welshmen seemed up to the task. An early try-scoring opportunity was lost when Gabe was tackled and unable to make the pass to Williams, who was in the clear. Wales came close to scoring a few more times, until Gabe receiving the ball from Trew, timed his pass perfectly to Williams, and he scored in the corner. Most of the play till this point had been in England's 25, but when the English broke out, Williams' defensive play was called into action. At half time, with further tries from Gibbs and Maddock, the Welsh were leading 13–0. England started the second half well but, after a long period in the Welsh half, Wales got an attacking opportunity, and Gabe, receiving the ball from Trew, beat his opposite number, and passed to Williams, who scored a second try in the corner. Maddock and Brown then scored two more tries, for a total of six to Wales.|$|E
