25|$|The {{first factor}} is {{compression}} of the navicular bone under the DDF tendon {{and the back}} of the small pastern bone. Repeated compression in this area can cause cartilage degeneration, with the cartilage flattening and gradually becoming less <b>springy</b> and shock-absorbing. It may also begin to erode. Cartilage degeneration is common in navicular horses, usually along the flexor surface. This finding, and the associated biochemical changes, have led some researchers to conclude that there are elements in navicular disease common to osteoarthritis, and to suggest similar therapeutic regimes.|$|E

Breast meat from male broilers was significantly <b>springier</b> and more chewy than those from females.

50|$|Reeds are pre-tuned to {{individual}} pitches. Tuning may involve changing a reeds length, the weight near its free end, or the stiffness near its fixed end. Longer, heavier and <b>springier</b> reeds produce deeper, lower sounds; shorter, lighter and stiffer reeds make higher-pitched sounds. If, as on most modern harmonicas, a reed is affixed {{above or below}} its slot {{rather than in the}} plane of the slot, it responds more easily to air flowing in the direction that initially would push it into the slot, i.e., as a closing reed. This difference in response to air direction makes it possible to include both a blow reed and a draw reed in the same air chamber and to play them separately without relying on flaps of plastic or leather (valves, wind-savers) to block the nonplaying reed.|$|R
50|$|The {{benefits}} of feedforward control are significant and can often justify the extra cost, {{time and effort}} required to implement the technology.

5000|$|Lucia Prauscello {{analyzed}} lines 25-27 of Idyll 11 {{and concluded}} that there are parallels between the characters of Idyll XI and the Odyssey, as the text mimics the thoughts and emotions expressed by characters in the Odyssey.

[...] Polyphemus and Nausicaa have an unrequited love for Galatea and Odysseus respectively; Polyphemus dreams {{of the day he}} will woo Galatea over, and Nausicaa dreams at the notion of marrying Odysseus. Prauscello contrasts Polyphemus' desire with Nausicaa’s by explaining Polyphemus’ mindset to be more superficial; the Cyclops does not share a matrimonial view with Galatea, where as Nausicaa arguably does, as she idols Odysseus.|$|R

40|$|Aims: Fourier Transform-Near Infrared (FT-NIR) {{spectrum}} and instrumental texture parameters were assessed as total phenol content and extractability predictors in intact grape seeds. Methods and results:The study {{was carried out}} on Cabernet-Sauvignon seeds from grapes harvested at six different advanced physiological stages throughout ripening and calibrated by flotation to reduce the in-field heterogeneity inside each sample. Among the instrumental mechanical properties tested (i. e., break force, break energy, Young's modulus of elasticity and deformation index), the seed Young's modulus of elasticity showed an increase during the first four weeks of ripening. This parameter also showed significant correlations with phenol content and extractability, although with low R coefficients. These correlations highlighted that the <b>springier</b> seed tissues greatly increase phenol extractability. Nevertheless, the best prediction of seed phenol content, performed directly on intact seeds, was found using FT-NIR spectroscopy in transmittance mode. The standard error of prediction for total phenol content was less than 8 %, while that for phenol extractability was worse. Conclusion: On {{the basis of these}} results, the two analytical methods could be applied in oenology for the rapid monitoring of seed phenolic maturity. Significance and impact of the study: The phenolic composition of grapes at the harvest time is a key factor determining their quality, and thus the quality of the finished wine. The chemical methods used for the determination of seed phenol content and extractability are generally slow because they require a preliminary extraction. Therefore, a rapid evaluation of these parameters could be highly interesting for the oenological secto...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Metallurgy {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} sciences. Its history can be traced back to 6000 BCE with the {{discovery}} of Gold, and each new discovery — Copper, Silver, Lead, Tin, Iron and Mercury — marked the beginning of a new era of civilization. Currently there are 86 known metals, but until the end of the 17 th century, only 12 of these were known. Steel (Fe–C alloy) was discovered in the 11 th century BCE; however, it took until 1709 CE before we mastered the smelting of pig-iron by using coke instead of charcoal and started the industrial revolution. The metallurgy of nowadays is mainly about discovering better materials with superior properties to fulfil the increasing demand of the global market. Promising are the Glassy Metals or Bulk Metallic Glasses (BMGs) — discovered at first in the late 50 s at the California Institute of Technology — which are several times stronger than the best industrial steels and 10 -times <b>springier.</b> The unusual structure that lacks crystalline grains makes BMGs so promising. They have a liquid-like structure that means they melt at lower temperatures, can be moulded nearly as easily as plastics, and can be shaped into features just 10 nm across. The best BMG formers are based on Zr, Pd, Pt, Ca, Au and, recently discovered, also Fe. They have typically three to five components with large atomic size mismatch and a composition close to a deep eutectic. Packing in such liquids is very dense, with a low content of free volume, resulting in viscosities that are several orders of magnitude higher than in pure metal melts...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{interaction}} between lipoxygenase-active soybean flour (LOX) and ascorbic acid (AA), on colour, rheological and sensory properties of wheat bread was studied {{with the aim}} of reducing the applied quantity of additives in bread formulations. RESULTS: The ascorbic acid (0 - 500 ppm) and active soybean flour (0 - 1 %) mixture improved bread-crumb colour by lowering the yellow hue in a higher proportion than those expressed by the components alone, characterising a synergistic mechanism ((y) over cap (b) = 15. 1 - (1. 7 x LOX) - (0. 5 x AA) - (5. 8 x LOX x AA), where : (y) over cap (b) represent the estimated value for the yellow hue parameter). No differences in flavour and porosity were seen between the samples. As supported by the instrumental methods, breads made with active soybean flour and ascorbic acid (LOX + AA) had whiter crumbs and were softer and <b>springier</b> than controls as assessed by a trained sensory panel. In summary, the combination of both active soybean flour and ascorbic acid showed synergism, promoting a greater bleaching effect than when used alone. CONCLUSION: These results suggest the potential use of active soybean flour as a synergistic ingredient in the substitution of artificial additives in bread making. Since the interaction on the bleaching response was not linear and active soybean flour showed a higher iron concentration (66. 40 +/- 4. 23 mu g g(- 1)) than non-active soybean flour (52. 30 +/- 0. 40 mu g g(- 1)), more studies are warranted to establish the biochemical mechanisms involved in this interaction.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of proteins has been long {{established in the}} bakery industry to obtain enriched products, but they also take active part on the making process of sweet baked goods. This study was focused on assessing the role of proteins on the rheology and quality of wheat free muffins by using rice flour. Six rice based formulations were used: one without added protein (No-Protein) and five with different protein sources: soy protein isolate (SPI), pea protein isolate (PPI), egg white protein (EWP), casein (C), and for comparing purposes vital wheat gluten (VWG) was included. Proteins effects were established by evaluating the rheological behaviour of batters measuring the storage modulus (G') and the loss modulus (G'), and the technological characteristics of the muffins obtained (specific volume, colour, and texture). The addition of SPI, PPI and C significantly (P< 0. 05) increased G', {{but this was not}} modified in batters containing EWP. Casein and EWP increased the specific volume of the muffins. SPI did not have effect on hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, chewiness, and resilience of the muffin, while PPI containing muffins were softer and <b>springier.</b> The overall results indicated that both the rheological properties of the batters and the technological characteristics of the muffin are dominated by the presence of the type of protein used in the formulations. Therefore the source of protein included in the formulation is fundamental to ensure the proper texture and other technological properties of these products. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Properties of all-beef patties containing 20 % fat and low-fat (10 %) beef patties containing water, carrageenan, encapsulated salt, and hydrolyzed vegetable protein with no additional additives (control) or with sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), sodium ascorbate (SA), sodium lactate (SL), STPP and SA, or SL and SA were compared. Control low-fat patties had lower cooking yields than high- fat patties. STPP and SL improved cooking yields. The control low-fat patties were harder and <b>springier</b> than the high-fat patties and the additional additives did not have significant effects (p> 0. 05) on the texture of low-fat patties. Precooked, oxygen-permeable polyvinylchloride (PVC) -wrapped low-fat control patties and high-fat control patties had similar values of 2 -thiobarbituric acid(TBA) -reactive substances after 6 days of refrigerated storage, but the low-fat control patties had better flavor than high-fat patties when either freshly cooked or stored. STPP was an effective antioxidant and was synergistic with SA as measured by TBA values on either a fat weight or sample weight basis and by sensory scores. SA alone reduced TBA values on either a fat weight or sample weight basis, but did not significantly improve flavor. SL reduced TBA values on a sample weight basis in refrigerated patties, regardless of packaging method, and in frozen, vacuum-packaged patties, but increased the values on a fat weight basis in frozen, PVC-wrapped patties. SL had no effect on TBA values on a sample weight basis of precooked, PVC-wrapped frozen patties or on TBA values on a fat weight basis of precooked, vacuum-packaged frozen patties or of precooked, PVC-wrapped refrigerated patties. SL did not improve flavor, but the combination of SA and SL improved sensory scores of stored patties. Control low-fat patties and high-fat patties did not have significantly different aerobic microbial plate counts.

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 As a major wheat {{exporter}} {{to countries}} {{all over the}} world, the United States has to produce wheat that satisfy different quality requirements requested by their customers. Over the past decade the United States has encountered a major problem, that of losing market share in Asia to Canada and Australia. The major reason was that the United States was unable to supply Asian countries with quality wheat suitable for noodle production. To overcome the problem, the U. S. wheat industry needs to understand the specific quality requirements required for Asian noodles. Research on understanding sensory characteristics of Asian noodles was proposed to bridge the communication barrier regarding Asian noodle quality. Descriptive analysis was utilized for this study to provide sensory characteristics of noodles from different Asian countries. In the first study, four classes of U. S. wheat flour samples were evaluated {{for their ability to}} make high quality Taiwanese noodles. Taiwanese noodle industry representatives came to the United States and made 4 major types of their noodles using U. S. wheat flours; they evaluated them by employing both the Taiwanese industries' scoring system and modified descriptive analysis. The results of this study indicated that hard white wheat was suitable for making two types of Taiwanese noodles (dry and yee noodles), a blend of hard red winter and hard red spring wheat was suitable for wet noodles, and a blend of hard red winter and white wheat was suitable for fresh noodles. The second study was undertaken to better understand the texture profile of noodles from various Asian countries. Sensory texture characteristics of fresh noodles from Taiwan, Thailand, and Malaysia were identified. A total of 16 patent flour samples for Taiwan, and 18 straight grade flour samples each for Thailand and Malaysia, were milled from hard white wheat varieties and made into each Asian country's noodles. A texture profile of each country's noodles was developed by an Oregon State University descriptive panel while quality evaluation was performed by each countries' noodle experts. The results characterized the Taiwanese noodles as the smoothest, <b>springiest,</b> and highest in integrity of noodles; the Thai noodles were the hardest, most dense, cohesive noodles and also higher in starch between teeth and toothpull; and the Malaysian noodles were the softest, least dense, cohesive, and sticky noodles.
