25|$|Investment bank securitizers {{were more}} willing to <b>securitize</b> risky loans because they {{generally}} retained minimal risk. Whereas the GSEs guaranteed {{the performance of their}} MBSs, private securitizers generally did not, and might only retain a thin slice of risk. Often, banks would offload this risk to insurance companies or other counterparties through credit default swaps, making their actual risk exposures extremely difficult for investors and creditors to discern.|$|E

40|$|Using novel data on investors' bond portfolios, {{we study}} the {{contagion}} {{of the crisis}} from <b>securitized</b> bonds to corporate bonds. When <b>securitized</b> bonds became “toxic” in August 2007, mutual funds retained the now illiquid <b>securitized</b> bonds and sold corporate bonds. Funds with negative flows or high liquidity needs liquidated more than others. Yield spreads increased more for corporate bonds whose pre-crisis bondholders were more heavily exposed to <b>securitized</b> bonds, compared to same-issuer bonds held by unexposed investors. The findings suggest that liquidity-constrained investors with exposure to <b>securitized</b> bonds {{played a role in}} propagating the crisis from <b>securitized</b> to corporate bonds...|$|R

25|$|On {{the same}} day, {{the plan to}} recapitalize the bank for €5 billion was announced; the bank also planned to <b>securitize</b> the entire bad loan {{portfolio}} for a target of €9.2 billion, which had a net book value of €10.2 billion as at 31 March 2016. The junior tranche would be allocated to the shareholders of the bank (for a proposed €1.6 billion); the mezzanine tranche would be sold to Atlante for €1.6 billion (revised to purchase junior mezzanine tranche for €1.526 billion in December 2016); the senior tranches would be sold to the market {{with some of them}} being eligible to state guarantee (Garanzia sulla Cartolarizzazione delle Sofferenze) for €6 billion. It was expected to reduce the gross NPLs ratio to 17.8%, on par with Italian average but still higher than many European peers. In December 2016, the disposal plan was modified: a senior mezzanine tranche (for €1.171 billion) was added—to be underwritten by the bank itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{shift toward}} riskier {{mortgages}} and private label MBS distribution occurred as financial institutions sought to maintain earnings levels {{that had been}} elevated during 2001–2003 by an unprecedented refinancing boom due to historically low interest rates. Earnings depended on volume, so maintaining elevated earnings levels necessitated expanding the borrower pool using lower underwriting standards and new products that the GSEs would not (initially) <b>securitize.</b> Thus, the shift away from GSE securitization to private-label securitization (PLS) also corresponded with a shift in mortgage product type, from traditional, amortizing, fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) to nontraditional, structurally riskier, nonamortizing, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM's), and in {{the start of a}} sharp deterioration in mortgage underwriting standards. The growth of PLS, however, forced the GSEs to lower their underwriting standards in an attempt to reclaim lost market share to please their private shareholders. Shareholder pressure pushed the GSEs into competition with PLS for market share, and the GSEs loosened their guarantee business underwriting standards in order to compete. In contrast, the wholly public FHA/Ginnie Mae maintained their underwriting standards and instead ceded market share.|$|E

40|$|<b>Securitized</b> {{real estate}} returns have {{traditionally}} been forecasted using economic variables. However, no consensus exists regarding the variables to use. Financial and real estate factors have recently emerged as an alternative set of variables useful in forecasting <b>securitized</b> real estate returns. This paper examines whether the predictive ability of {{the two sets of}} variables differs. We use fractional cointegration analysis to identify whether long-run nonlinear relations exist between <b>securitized</b> real estate and each of the two sets of forecasting variables. That is, we examine whether such relationships are characterized by long memory, short memory, mean reversion (no long-run effects) or no mean reversion (no long-run equilibrium). Empirical analyses are conducted using data for the U. S., the U. K., and Australia. The results show that financial and real estate factors generally outperform economic variables in forecasting <b>securitized</b> real estate returns. Long memory (long-range dependence) is generally found between <b>securitized</b> real estate returns and stocks, bonds, and direct real estate returns, while only short memory is found between <b>securitized</b> real estate returns and the economic variables. Such results imply that to forecast <b>securitized</b> real estate returns, it may not be necessary to identify the economic variables that are related to changing economic trends and business conditions.

2500|$|Reduces funding costs: Through securitization, {{a company}} rated BB but with AAA worthy cash flow {{would be able}} to borrow at {{possibly}} AAA rates. [...] This is the number one reason to <b>securitize</b> a cash flow and can have tremendous impacts on borrowing costs. [...] The difference between BB debt and AAA debt can be multiple hundreds of basis points. [...] For example, Moody's downgraded Ford Motor Credit's rating in January 2002, but senior automobile backed securities, issued by Ford Motor Credit in January 2002 and April 2002, continue to be rated AAA because of the strength of the underlying collateral and other credit enhancements.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{the most}} common {{securitization}} trusts are sponsored by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, US government-sponsored enterprises. Ginnie Mae, a US government-sponsored enterprise backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, guarantees that its investors receive timely payments but buys limited numbers of mortgage notes. Some private institutions also <b>securitize</b> mortgages, known as [...] "private-label" [...] mortgage securities. Issuances of private-label mortgage-backed securities increased dramatically from 2001 to 2007 and then ended abruptly in 2008, when real estate markets began to falter. An example of a private-label issuer is the real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC), a tax-structure entity usually used for CMOs; among other things, a REMIC structure avoids so-called double taxation.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2000, {{to expand}} the {{secondary}} market for affordable community-based mortgages and to increase liquidity for CRA-eligible loans, Fannie Mae committed to purchase and <b>securitize</b> $2 billion of [...] "MyCommunityMortgage" [...] loans. In November 2000 Fannie Mae announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") would soon require it to dedicate 50% of its business to low- and moderate-income families." [...] It stated that since 1997 Fannie Mae had done nearly $7 billion in CRA business with depository institutions, but its goal was $20 billion. In 2001 Fannie Mae announced that it had acquired $10 billion in specially-targeted Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) loans more than {{one and a half}} years ahead of schedule, and announced its goal to finance over $500 billion in CRA business by 2010, about one third of loans anticipated to be financed by Fannie Mae during that period.|$|E
5000|$|In {{another type}} of securitization, known as [...] "private label" [...] securitization, default risk is {{generally}} not retained by the <b>securitizing</b> entity. Instead, the <b>securitizing</b> entity passes on default risk to investors. The <b>securitizing</b> entity, therefore, has relatively little incentive to monitor originators and maintain loan quality. [...] "Private label" [...] securitization refers to securitizations structured by financial institutions such as investment banks, commercial banks, and non-bank mortgage lenders.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a continuous time, contingent claims model of mortgage valuation with strategic behavior {{to show that}} mortgages that are <b>securitized</b> are characterized by significantly higher loan to value ratios than mortgages held on the balance sheet of the originator, if <b>securitized</b> mortgages cannot be renegotiated. Insofar as securitization inhibits loan modification, {{it serves as a}} credible threat to the borrower that default will provoke foreclosure. This enhances the value of the lender’s claim on the loan collateral, the home, and she is willing to lend more per dollar of collateral value. An important implication of the analysis is that the higher loan to value ratio for the <b>securitized</b> mortgage does not imply that the <b>securitized</b> mortgage is characterized by looser underwriting standards than the mortgage held on balance sheet. Higher loan to value ratios for <b>securitized</b> mortgages do not necessarily constitute evidence that securitization encourages risky lending...|$|R
40|$|We {{compare the}} ex ante {{observable}} risk characteristics and the default rates of <b>securitized</b> mortgage loans and mortgage loans retained {{by the original}} lender. We find that privately <b>securitized</b> loans tend to be riskier and to default {{at a faster rate}} than loans <b>securitized</b> with the GSEs and lender-retained loans. However, the differences in default rates across investor types are of secondary importance for explaining mortgage defaults compared to more conventional predictors, such as original loan-to-value ratios and the path for house prices. Privately <b>securitized</b> home mortages have conditionally higher expected returns than retained loans, suggesting the presence of risk factors that are unobservable but nonetheless at least partially acknowledged by the market...|$|R

40|$|Using a novel data of {{institutional}} investors’ bond holdings, we examine a {{transmission of the}} crisis of 2007 - 2008 from the <b>securitized</b> bond market to the corporate bond market via joint ownership of these bonds by investors. We posit that, ceteris paribus, corporate bonds held by investors with high exposure to <b>securitized</b> bonds and liquidity needs experience greater selling pressure and price declines (yield increases) {{at the onset of}} the crisis. We further test predictions of a model of dynamic asset liquidation: Investors with large enough future liquidity shocks retain liquid assets, and instead sell assets that have relatively high temporary price impacts of trading. Mutual funds with higher sensitivity of pay to performance held higher portions of their portfolios in <b>securitized</b> bonds prior to the crisis. After the onset of the crisis, these funds did not sell <b>securitized</b> bonds on average and instead sold corporate bonds to meet their liquidity needs. Sales rose and yield spreads widened more for those corporate bonds whose mutual fund holders’ portfolios were more heavily exposed to <b>securitized</b> bonds, compared to same-issuer bonds held by unexposed funds. Shorter-horizon mutual funds liquidated greater portions of their corporate bond holdings and in particular lower-rated bonds. In contrast, insurance companies sold little regardless of their exposure as long as they were above the minimum capital ratio threshold. These findings suggest that short-horizon mutual funds with high exposure to <b>securitized</b> bonds played a role in transmitting the crisis from <b>securitized</b> bonds to corporate bonds. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{presence}} of common factors in the <b>securitized</b> real estate markets of the Untied States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Hong Kong (HK), and Singapore (SG). Using a combination of factor analysis and canonical correlation analysis on 10 -year monthly return data for 142 real estate securities in the four markets, more common risk factors among real estate securities within a country than across countries are detected. In addition, {{there is at least}} one common <b>securitized</b> real estate market factor that is moderately correlated with the world real estate market, and to a lesser extent, with the world stock market. However, the degree of linkage across the four <b>securitized</b> real estate markets is much weaker than the strong linkages present across the four economies. It further appears that the extent to which correlations are found in international <b>securitized</b> real estate markets might largely be due to the increasing integrated nature of the world real economy, rather than a result of the globalization of financial markets. The results are preliminary, but indicative, and suggest that more studies exploring how common factors, together with the local market portfolio, could help explain the return-generating process of <b>securitized</b> real estate. <b>Securitized</b> real estate markets Common factors Correlation structure Globalization of financial markets Canonical correlation analysis Macroeconomy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} predictability of <b>securitized</b> real estate returns {{differs from that}} of stock returns. It also provides a cross-country comparison of <b>securitized</b> real estate return predictability. In contrast to most of the literature on this issue, the analysis is not based on a multifactor asset pricing framework as such analyses may bias the results. We use a time series approach and thus create a level playing field to compare the predictability of the two asset classes. Forecasts are performed with ARMA and ARMA-EGARCH models and evaluated by comparing the entire empirical distributions of prediction errors, as well as with a trading strategy. The results, based on daily data for the 1990 - 2007 period, show that <b>securitized</b> real estate returns are generally more predictable than stock returns in countries with mature and well established REIT regimes. ARMA-EGARCH models are found to have portfolio outperformance potential even in the presence of transaction costs, with generally better results for <b>securitized</b> real estate than for stocks.

We document that Term Loan B facilities, facilities originated by banks that originate CLOs, and loans of B-Rated firms are <b>securitized</b> more frequently than other loans. Spreads on facilities estimated to be more likely to be subsequently <b>securitized</b> have lower spreads than otherwise similar facilities.
