50|$|When the English Civil War {{began in}} 1642, Pym became {{involved}} in solving the financial problems of the Parliamentary <b>side,</b> <b>heading</b> the Committee of Safety from 4 July 1642. He was a key organizer of the loans and taxes that Parliament needed to fund its army and fight the King, and he negotiated the Solemn League and Covenant that gained the support of Scottish Presbyterians. These two things laid firm foundations for Parliament's success in 1645-6 because it now had financial and military resources far beyond those of the Royalists. Pym died, probably of cancer, at Derby House on 8 December 1643 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.
