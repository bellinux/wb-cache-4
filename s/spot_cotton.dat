40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{a patient with}} peripheral retinal ischaemia and neovascularisation who was diagnosed with streptococcus mitis-induced bacterial endocarditis. Methods: Retrospective analysis of case report. A 57 -year-old man presented {{with a history of}} a rapidly progressive, bilateral, painless visual loss. He also suffered from pain in the neck and lower back and a weight loss of 10 kg. He underwent a full ophthalmologic work-up, laboratory investigations, and imaging of the spine. Results: BCVA was reduced to 20 / 40 in the right eye and 20 / 32 in the left eye. Fundoscopy showed rare intra-retinal haemorrhages including few Roth <b>spots</b> and <b>cotton</b> wool lesions. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated large areas of peripheral retinal ischaemia and neovascularisation. Imaging of the spine showed spondylodiscitis on several levels. Further imaging and blood cultures confirmed bacterial endocarditis of the mitral valve. Streptococcus mitis was subsequently identified as the causative organism. Conclusion: Peripheral retinal ischaemia and neovascularisation were previously unrecognised as a feature of infectious endocarditis. Therefore, their presence, apart from the classic Roth spots, should prompt the consideration of infectious endocarditis in the etiologic work-up...|$|R

40|$|A symptomless {{phase of}} Alternaria macrospora leaf blight {{that occurs in}} {{commercial}} cultivation of cotton between visible disease outbreaks was studied to determine its cause and effect. Most plants between the two outbreaks of leaf blight epidemics in the field were infected but symptomless; yet during the outbreaks the number of infected symptomless plants was minimal. Drought, high temperature, low humidity, and high salinity increased plant resistance to leaf blight by decreasing visible symptoms and causing symptomless infections. Symptomless plants provided inoculum to infect and produce a visible disease in healthy plants when favorable conditions for disease development resumed. Plant age had minimal influence on symptom-lessness, and sunlight exposure had none. Defoliation {{was related to the}} density of spots on leaves and to the virulence of the strain. Polyphenoloxidase activity and phenol accumulation were similar in both disease phases. Plants having visible symptoms produced more spores, but spores from symptomless plants were detached more easily by air currents. Symptom-lessness apparently is a common manifestation of alternaria leaf blight of cotton. It is probably influenced by agroenvironmental parameters that induce the two phases of disease expression.
