In the factor analysis, ten factors emerged.

As government agencies and the Department of Defense move toward implementations, additional goals often include saving design data for reuse. This paper briefly reviews the government records management requirements then investigates candidate meanings of 'reuse' and proposes an enhanced design records retention approach. The recommended strategy that emerges is, for a given program or product family, to invest in rich and readily re-executable preservation of design artifacts for one or two subsequent generations, then downgrade the data in utility through conversions, ultimately reaching the NARA minimum standard for permanent historical-interest archives...|$|R

Results show no indication of an increased similarity of newspapers’ content with either source content or news agency content, thus providing no justification for the concerns about an increasing dependency of newspapers on subsidized content.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} underlying distortions in {{sense of}} agency, i. e. {{the experience of}} controlling one's own actions and their consequences, in schizophrenia are not fully understood and have barely been investigated in patients classified as being in a putative psychotic prodrome. This study aims to expound the contribution of early and late illness-related processes. Thirty schizophrenia patients, 30 putatively prodromal patients and 30 healthy controls were instructed to reproduce a computer-generated series of drum sounds on a drum pad. While tapping, subjects heard either their self-produced tones or a computer-controlled reproduction of the drum tone series that used either exactly the same, an accelerated or decelerated tempo. Subjects had to determine the <b>source</b> of <b>agency.</b> Results show similar significant impairments in assigning the <b>source</b> of <b>agency</b> under ambiguous conditions in schizophrenia and putatively prodromal patients and an exaggerated self-attribution bias, {{both of which were}} significantly correlated with increased (ego-) psychopathology. Patient groups, however, benefited significantly more than controls from additional sensorimotor cues to agency. Sensorimotor input seems to be a compensatory mechanism involved in correctly attributing agency. We deduce that altered awareness of agency may hold promise as an additional risk factor for psychosis...|$|R
