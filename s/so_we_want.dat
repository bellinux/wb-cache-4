2500|$|Former Ambassador to Egypt [...] Frank Wisner said:"It wasn’t the {{military}} that plotted the seizure {{of the government and}} grabbed it. It was a massive public uprising that, left unchecked, would have produced great violence.

The cry from the crowd was they wanted new elections … to help decide the country's future, which has been so troubled. The military was faced with, genuinely overheated situation … It isn’t a coup in any classic sense and, yet, the military played a role in upsetting the government. We have to ask ourselves, then, finally, what are the interests of the United States? And here the president wisely has waiver authority and has to make a judgment. Egypt is the largest and most influential country in the Middle East. Egypt is central to peace with Israel. Egypt's fate will influence the course of politics elsewhere in the region. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to be very, very careful before we go out and condemn an event that has, by the most recent polling of Egypt's best pollsters, 80 percent support in the population. What is clear is the wave of anger against the government that drove Morsi from power, enjoyed massive, massive public support in the many, many millions of Egyptians.|$|E
