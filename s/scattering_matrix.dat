40|$|Abstract: Almost {{complete}} {{absence of}} the information on <b>scattering</b> <b>matrices</b> for real physical objects is the obstacle to the successful solving of the polarized radiative transfer problems. The known <b>scattering</b> <b>matrices,</b> which are measured experimentally or obtained numerically, are always determined with errors. Thus, the main problem of the transport polarized radiative transfer theory is the problem to develop a physical correctness criterion for <b>scattering</b> <b>matrices,</b> to check and correct the known <b>scattering</b> <b>matrices.</b> The {{solution to this problem}} proposed. The incorrectness of the experimental <b>scattering</b> <b>matrices</b> is established for the natural ocean water probes for the scattering angles near 0 or 180 degrees.

500|$|It {{was in his}} 1945 {{dissertation}} that Belevitch {{first introduced}} the important idea of the <b>scattering</b> <b>matrix</b> (called repartition matrix by Belevitch). [...] This work was reproduced in part in a later paper by Belevitch, Transmission Losses in 2n-terminal Networks. [...] Belgium was occupied by Nazi Germany for most of World War II and this prevented Belevitch from any communication with American colleagues. [...] It was only after the war that {{it was discovered that}} the same idea, under the <b>scattering</b> <b>matrix</b> name, had independently been used by American scientists developing military radars. [...] The American work by Montgomery, Dicke and Purcell was published in 1948. [...] Belevitch in his work had applied scattering matrices to lumped circuits and was certainly the first to do so, whereas the Americans were concerned with the distributed circuits used at microwave frequencies in radar.Montgomery et al., pp.146-161Valkenburg, p.336Vandewalle, p.429 ...|$|E

30|$|However, the {{classical}} LDA formulation requires the nonsingularity of the <b>scatter</b> <b>matrices</b> involved. For undersampled problems, where the data dimensionality {{is much larger}} than the sample size, all <b>scatter</b> <b>matrices</b> are singular and classical LDA fails. Many extensions, including null space LDA (N-LDA) [15] and orthogonal LDA (OLDA), have been proposed in the past to overcome this problem. N-LDA aims to maximize the between-class distance in the null space of the within-class <b>scatter</b> <b>matrix,</b> while OLDA computes a set of orthogonal discriminant vectors via the simultaneous diagonalization of the <b>scatter</b> <b>matrices.</b>|$|R
500|$|In a 1937 paper [...] "On the Mathematical Description of Light Nuclei by the Method of Resonating Group Structure", Wheeler {{introduced}} the S-matrix – short for <b>scattering</b> <b>matrix</b> – [...] "a unitary matrix of coefficients connecting the asymptotic behavior of an arbitrary particular solution [...] {{with that of}} solutions of a standard form." [...] Werner Heisenberg subsequently developed {{the idea of the}} S-matrix in the 1940s. Due to the problematic divergences present in quantum field theory at that time, Heisenberg was motivated to isolate the essential features of the theory that would not be affected by future changes as the theory developed. In doing so he was led to introduce a unitary [...] "characteristic" [...] S-matrix, which became an important tool in particle physics.|$|E
500|$|Another design approach, {{particularly}} {{suitable for}} CAD {{because it is}} a numerical method, is to decompose the filter into a number of finite elements. [...] These elements are a large number of simple steps and ridges. [...] A number of methods are available to analyse the individual elements. [...] The mode matching technique expands the field equations of the element into a series of eigenfunctions and then for each mode matches the field at the interface between elements. [...] The Galerkin method expands the field equations into polynomial functions such as Gegenbauer polynomials or Chebyshev polynomials. [...] These methods can be mixed according to what is convenient for a particular type of element. [...] Whichever analysis method is used, the final output needed is the scattering parameters matrix for each element. [...] The overall filter response is then found from the combined <b>scattering</b> <b>matrix</b> of all the individual element matrices. [...] This method is analytic rather than synthetic, that is, a trial design must first exist in order to be analysed unlike synthesis methods where the starting point is a prescribed transfer function from which a design is synthesised.Manuilov and Kobrin, 2005, pp.93–94Manuilov et al., 2009, pp.527–528 ...|$|E

40|$|As a {{supervised}} dimensionality reduction technique, linear {{discriminant analysis}} has a serious overfitting problem {{when the number of}} training samples per class is small. The main reason is that the between-and within-class <b>scatter</b> <b>matrices</b> computed from the limited number of training samples deviate greatly from the underlying ones. To overcome the problem without increasing the number of training samples, we propose making use {{of the structure of the}} given training data to regularize the between- and within-class <b>scatter</b> <b>matrices</b> by between-and within-cluster <b>scatter</b> <b>matrices,</b> respectively, and simultaneously. The within-and between-cluster matrices are computed from unsupervised clustered data.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that any pair of scatter and spatial <b>scatter</b> <b>matrices</b> yields an {{estimator}} of the separating matrix for complex-valued independent component analysis (ICA). Scatter (resp. spatial <b>scatter)</b> <b>matrix</b> is a generalized covariance matrix {{in the sense}} that it is a positive definite hermitian matrix functional that satisfies the same affine (resp. unitary) equivariance property as does the covariance matrix and possesses an additional IC-property, namely, it reduces to a diagonal matrix at distributions with independent marginals. <b>Scatter</b> <b>matrix</b> is used to decorrelate the data and the eigenvalue decomposition of the spatial <b>scatter</b> <b>matrix</b> is used to find the unitary mixing matrix of the uncorrelated data. The method is a generalization of the FOBI algorithm, where a conventional covariance matrix and a certain fourth-order moment matrix take the place of the scatter and spatial <b>scatter</b> <b>matrices,</b> respectively. Emphasis is put on estimators employing robust scatter and spatial <b>scatter</b> <b>matrices.</b> The proposed approach is one among the computationally most attractive ones, and a new efficient algorithm that avoids decorrelation of the data is also proposed.
