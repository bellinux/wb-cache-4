5000|$|This {{time-varying}} {{network model}} was first {{developed for the}} case when transmission rates every slot t were determined by general functions of a channel <b>state</b> <b>matrix</b> and a power allocation matrix. [...] The model {{can also be used}} when rates are determined by other control decisions, such as server allocation, sub-band selection, coding type, and so on. It assumes the supportable transmission rates are known and there are no transmission errors. Extended formulations of backpressure routing can be used for networks with probabilistic channel errors, including networks that exploit the wireless broadcast advantage via multi-receiver diversity.|$|E

In general, determining algebraic conditions (on the subsystems’ <b>state</b> <b>matrices)</b> for the existence of a CQLF remains an open task. For switched system with only two modes, [47] derives a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a CQLF for a second-order (two dimensional) continuous-time switched system with two modes while a similar approach is proposed in [41] by considering a discrete-time system. Their approach is based on the stability of the matrix pencil constructed using the <b>state</b> <b>matrices</b> corresponding to the two modes. While the matrix pencil presents a different perspective on the CQLF existence problem, it also lacks an analytical solution.|$|R
