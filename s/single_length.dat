The new wall reduced the lower terminus to a <b>single</b> <b>length</b> of track.

25|$|A few knots {{have become}} more or less {{standard}} for attaching the {{various parts of the}} fly lines and backing, etc., together. A detailed discussion of most of these knots is available in any good book on fly fishing. Some of the knots that are in most every fly angler's arsenal are: the improved clinch knot which is commonly used to attach the fly to the leader, the overhand slip knot or arbor knot which is used to attach the backing to the spool, the albright knot which can be used to attach the fly line to the backing. A loop can also be put in fly line backing using a bimini twist. Often, a loop is added to the business end of the fly line to facilitate the connection to the leader. This loop may take one of several forms. It may be formed by creating a loop in the end of the fly line itself or by adding a braided loop or a loop of monofilament nylon (as in Gray's Loop). Alternatively, a <b>single</b> <b>length</b> of monofilament nylon, or fluorocarbon, may be tied {{to the end of the}} fly line using a nail or tube knot or a needle knot. A loop can then be tied at the end of this monofilament butt length or butt section using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, to which the tapered or untapered leader, also looped using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, may in turn be connected via a loop to loop connection. The use of loop to loop connections between the fly line and the leader provides a quick and convenient way to change or replace a tapered leader. Many commercially produced tapered leaders come with a pre-tied loop connection.|$|E

40|$|In this research, it {{was aimed}} to {{determine}} the phenotypic correlations among some physical traits of Norduz and Karakas sheep. Animal material was consisted from 2 - 6 years of age of breeding flocks of 50 Norduz and 50 Karakas ewes. Traits measured were greasy fleece weight, fiber diameter, clean fleece percentage, staple <b>length,</b> <b>single</b> fiber actual <b>length,</b> <b>single</b> fiber natural <b>length,</b> breaking strength, elasticity {{and the number of}} crimp in 2. 54 cm. There was a positive correlation between clean fleece percentage and fiber diameter, it was insignificant for both genotypes. The estimated phenotypic correlations between staple length and greasy fleece weight was 0. 403 (p< 0. 01) and 0. 445 (p< 0. 01) in Norduz and Karakas sheep, respectively. It was understood that traits like fiber diameter, length, fleece weight and the number of crimp should be evaluated together in breeding studies on fleece yield in Norduz and Karakas sheep...|$|R

2500|$|The polo mallet {{comprises}} cane shaft with a rubber-wrapped grip, and a webbed thong, {{called a}} sling, for wrapping around the thumb, and a wooden cigar shaped head. The shaft {{is made of}} manau-cane (not bamboo, which is hollow) although {{a small number of}} mallets today are made from Composite materials. Composite materials are usually not preferred by top players, because the shaft of composite mallets can't absorb vibrations as well as traditional cane mallets. The mallet head is generally made from a hardwood called tipa, approximately 9" [...] inches long. The mallet head weighs from 160 grams (5.6 ounces) to 240 grams (8.4 ounces), depending on player preference and the type of wood used, and the shaft can vary in weight and flexibility depending on the player's preference. The weight of the mallet head is of important consideration for the more seasoned players. Female players often use lighter mallets than male players. For some polo players, the length of the mallet depends {{on the size of the}} horse: the taller the horse, the longer the mallet. However, some players prefer to use a <b>single</b> <b>length</b> of mallet regardless of the height of the horse. Either way, playing horses of differing heights requires some adjustment by the rider. Variable lengths of the mallet typically range from 50 inches (127 centimetres) to 53 inches (134 centimetres). The term mallet is used exclusively in US English; British English prefers the term polo stick. The ball is struck with the broad sides of the mallet head rather than its round and flat tips.|$|E
2500|$|When {{recording}} [...] "Hasu no Hana", {{the band}} {{decided that the}} mid-tempo pop song would pair well with [...] "Sayonara wa Emotion", a [...] "raw and emotional" [...] song, so decided to release these together as a double A-side single on October 29. [...] "Sayonara wa Emotion" [...] / [...] "Hasu no Hana" [...] was the band's 10th physical single release, so to commemorate this, made the release a deluxe CD/DVD package, featuring an EP-like <b>single</b> <b>length</b> and over 50 minutes of DVD footage. The single featured two B-sides, {{the first of which}} was a remix of the version of [...] "Ame(B) that Sakanaction performed on their Sakanaquarium Sakanatribe tour, given a stronger club sound by musician Aoki Takamasa. Yamaguchi asked Aoki to create this different mix of the song, as he felt that he had overworked the song. The second B-side was a remix of the band's 2013 single [...] "Music" [...] in an acoustic style by Japanese musician Cornelius. The single's DVD featured two studio live performances that had originally been broadcast on their Ustream channel: [...] "Good-Bye" [...] featuring Tamaki Roy and [...] "Sample", rearranged by Sachio [...] "Sunny" [...] Sasaki, including interviews with both Tamaki and Sasaki. The physical single's cover and booklet were created by Hatos. He attempted to create cover artwork that would make a world view that bridged both songs. The booklet was printed with heat-sensitive ink, so that the [...] "Hasu no Hana" [...] lyrics were only visible when exposed to heat.|$|E

In general, TCN has excellent error detection properties and is much more thoroughly specified in this regard than other embedded network protocols.
