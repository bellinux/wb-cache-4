For example, a slave could not engage free boys in pederastic relationships ("A slave <b>shall</b> <b>not</b> be the lover {{of a free}} boy nor follow after him, or else he shall receive fifty blows of the public lash."), and they were forbidden from the palaestrae ("A slave <b>shall</b> <b>not</b> take exercise or anoint himself in the wrestling-schools."). Both laws are attributed to Solon. Fathers wanting to protect their sons from unwanted advances provided them with a slave guard, called a paidagogos, to escort the boy in his travels.|$|E
