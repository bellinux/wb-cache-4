25|$|The second 1953 {{international}} was {{an official}} match for both teams: England {{playing with a}} stronger line-up involving Alf Ramsey, Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney; Argentina <b>sticking</b> <b>with</b> the same line-up used in the first match. The game, however, was abandoned after 36 minutes due to torrential rain, with a 0–0 scoreline. The teams next met in the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile, where England's 3–1 victory in the group stage led to Argentina's exit from the tournament. Argentina's first victory over England in a full international occurred in a 1–0 win in June 1964, during the Taça de Nações friendly tournament in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} several years Jones {{cemented}} his spot in both the Warriors and Kiwis, <b>sticking</b> <b>with</b> the Warriors despite the lack of success on and off the field. Between 1995 and 1999 he played over 100 consecutive first grade games for the Warriors. In 1999 he broke his arm playing for the Kiwis against Tonga, and as a result missed {{the first half of the}} 2000 NRL season, breaking his consecutive streak. At the end of 2000 the Warriors were bankrupt and were sold for the second time in their short history. Jones was the first signing by the new franchise owned by current owner Eric Watson and it was his signing that convinced many other players to re-sign with the club.|$|E
25|$|In his decade-long {{pursuit of}} an elusive title, Mike Thibault {{found himself in}} the proverbial hot seat to {{engineer}} a deep run. But an absence of urgency was reflected in the team's free agency approach – making small waves to pry Thompson and Cash from their respective teams – to solely ink rugged forward Mistie Mims in relief of Charles. <b>Sticking</b> <b>with</b> the status quo meant the roster was set {{so much so that the}} Sun drafted an unheralded Malian prospect. Going into the season, Thibault had assembled a deep roster that necessitated only a couple minor moves to cap the off-season process. The coach's patience paid dividends when his burgeoning core bolted to a 6–1 start highlighted by a chafed Montgomery turning the starting reins over to Hightower. Leading into the 1-month Olympic hiatus, the Sun strung together a five-win streak to improve to a league-best 15–4 mark. Following the ill-timed Games, which saw the club's Jones-Charles tandem help capture gold for Team USA, Connecticut continued to perform superbly while short-handed. They finished the season 25–9, with a better road record (13–4) than as hosts. The Sun fended off late Liberty rallies to sweep their way into a joust with the Fever in what was the team's first Conference finals since 2010's radical facelift. In the series, the Sun took themselves to the doorstep of a Finals berth after notching a decisive Game 1 rout. But building on a stirring two-point Game 2 win and a rally cry after losing Douglas, Indiana derailed the Sun's seemingly predestined trip in a 71–87 home romp, a defeat that essentially cost longtime coach Thibault his job. The lion's share of the season's fortunes came from the talented triumvirate of Lawson, Jones and league MVP Tina Charles flanked by Mims and sixth woman Montgomery carving a niche as an energy duo off the pines. Though failure was what came to mind in taking stock of the team's decade season; the Fever capturing the year's title being emblematic of that.|$|E

Kubicek was even more critical: [...] "the most over-the-top, terribly cliched scene ever". However, Votta gave [...] "kudos to Glee for <b>sticking</b> <b>with</b> Mike's story this season as he figures out his path", and West wrote that Shum [...] "played it well", while Canning said it and the later scene with his mother [...] "were mighty effective, if a bit stereotypical". Hyman and West also approved of the latter scene.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive reviews. David Jefferies of Allmusic {{gave the}} album {{a score of}} 3.5 of 5 stars, commenting that the album keeps its sci-fi elements on its cover artwork as Queen keeps her reggaeton strong by <b>sticking</b> <b>with</b> her original formula; he later claimed it was a standard-issue effort. Ayala Ben-Yehuda of Billboard noted that the album features a set filled with a more-honest longing than most of what is heard on commercial Latin radio. Frances Tirado of Primera Hora gave the album a positive review, stating that [...] "Ivy Queen shows vocal maturity and evolution of rhythms". Sarah Bardeen of Rhapsody felt [...] "each track {{could have been a}} single." ...|$|E

Andy eventually goes back on his decision, and David allows him to stay on in a sales position. However, mere hours later Andy feels that he is only <b>sticking</b> <b>with</b> his Dundler-Mifflin job because it is safe and that he has to take a shot at achieving fame. Fearing his conviction will falter a second time, he decides he cannot simply quit, but get fired. This proves difficult as he is unable to make himself go through with any offense more serious than defecating on David's car. Andy bids farewell to his coworkers with an unexpectedly moving rendition of [...] "I Will Remember You", prompting them to comment to the documentary crew that he may have star potential after all.|$|E
500|$|A {{group of}} editors writing for People also praised the record's [...] "fresh and original" [...] melodies and [...] "quick-tempoed cool", adding, [...] "Kudos to Green Day, young punk's reigning purists, for <b>sticking</b> <b>with</b> {{what they know}} best." [...] Sandy Masuo of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the [...] "mature songwriting that really makes this album tick", noting that [...] "Naturally, a couple of thrash 'n' bash hard-core paeans are included, but they're {{surrounded}} by songs that are surprisingly varied in character and grounded in a pop aesthetic that evokes a gaggle of great tunesmiths." [...] Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "If Green Day still has a loyal following, its fans are bound {{to find something to}} like on Nimrod; for all the attempts at diversity, the record is packed with mile-wide hooks and sing-along anthems." ...|$|E
500|$|Chad Grischow of IGN wrote: [...] "Lee's skyward vocals {{suit the}} album's {{obsession}} with the emotional frustration and devastation of a break-up well, ripe with romantically longing tunes like gorgeous power ballad [...] "Lost In Paradise", where her breathy vocals in the beginning awaken as she passionately apologizes for not <b>sticking</b> <b>with</b> the guy who believed in her." [...] Digital Spys Lewis Corner said that the song [...] "continues the trend as a black-eyed rock ballad of towering string sections and lyrics of despair and heartbreak." [...] Billboard magazine's Christa Titus wrote that Lee's voice was [...] "powerful and flexible as ever" [...] in [...] "the deep croons that introduce 'Lost in Paradise'." [...] A more mixed review for the song was given by Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe who wrote that the slow tempo of the song provided by piano and strings made it a drag where [...] "the band itself gets very little breathing room." ...|$|E

Furthermore, he praised her [...] "all-around meanness" [...] and the [...] "hilarity of her singing". Houx wrote that [...] "the return of Jan Levinson and the final solution to get her business was pretty good." [...] Adams, on the other hand, was critical of the return of Hardin, noting that [...] "there's little reason to justify Melora Hardin's presence in 'The Whale other than [...] "an obligation [...] The Offices final-season victory lap." [...] White noted that it [...] "was nice to see Melora Hardin in the role one last time", but wrote that [...] "it's a shame that the show is <b>sticking</b> <b>with</b> the crazy version of the character rather than mellowing her out a bit". Melora Hardin's performance was later submitted by the producers of The Office for an [...] "Outstanding Guest Actor in Comedy Series" [...] Emmy consideration.|$|E
500|$|Slap-Happy was {{considered}} more varied than previous L7 albums. Although the album features several songs with aggressive guitar riffs that {{are reminiscent of}} the band's previous releases, {{as seen in the}} tracks [...] "On My Rockin' Machine", [...] "Long Green" [...] and [...] "Mantra Down", it also contains slow-paced and guitar-driven ballads like [...] "Livin' Large" [...] and [...] "Freezer Burn". The former song was described by Marc Weingarten of Rolling Stone as [...] "a kind of rallying cry for the indie-rock underclass", while the latter was seen as a melodic song that [...] "juxtaposes harsh words delivered in mellow, floating vocals." [...] Slap-Happy also contains songs that borrow elements from genres other than rock. For example, the song [...] "Little One" [...] contains elements of both polka and country music. As Sparks noted, [...] "We're all into all kinds of music, but I listen to very little rock, actually. Our approach was to pretty much do what we've always done, but we're not concerned with <b>sticking</b> <b>with</b> a particular style. There's diversity in our songwriting." ...|$|E
500|$|Lego Racers {{gameplay}} {{received a}} mixed reaction from critics. Charla called creating and testing cars {{a lot of}} fun, especially because the way a car is built has [...] "a major effect on how it controls", and IGN's reviewer for the PC version found that unlocking new bricks in the circuit mode for use in car customization is addictive. However, Stahl called the game's construction system unfriendly, stating that the player is [...] "better off just <b>sticking</b> <b>with</b> one of the default vehicles". Imperio said that handling the cars is [...] "surprisingly tight", calling the N64 control scheme intuitive. Conversely, Charla found {{that most of the}} cars feel top-heavy, and stated that the racing is awful. IGN's reviewer for the PC version praised the power up system, calling it pretty cool, as well as stating that the Power Plus bricks add [...] "a new strategy to the game", but Stahl called the system [...] "terribly lame". Reviewers also criticised the game's multiplayer features, with IGN's PC reviewer calling the split screen mode simple, and an Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewer stating that the [...] "lack of multiplayer options" [...] hurts Lego Racers replay value.|$|E

500|$|Of the European shows, {{critical}} reaction was generally quite favorable. [...] The Irish Times said Springsteen showing {{no signs of}} age as he neared his 60th birthday, despite taking a spill during his stage antics in rainy Dublin, and remarked upon how [...] "a set that features so many songs about the toughness of life ... can be delivered with such extraordinary verve {{that by the time}} you leave, you’re very glad to be alive." [...] The Independent echoed the sentiment in reviewing the Hyde Park show, writing that he showed [...] "the vigour of a frontman a third of his age" [...] and that [...] "Springsteen's intensity was staggering from first powerful vocal to final thrashed-out chord." [...] The Bath Chronicle saluted Springsteen's performance at Glastonbury, saying [...] "As all the tickets were sold before Springsteen was even confirmed on the bill, he must have known he was facing something very rare for him – the musical equivalent of a sporting 'away match' where not everyone was necessarily a worshipper at the altar of Bruce." [...] They concluded that Springsteen gave [...] "a performance of passion, exuberance, exhilaration and musical majesty" [...] while <b>sticking</b> <b>with</b> his standard tour set list and not resorting to playing many of his better-known hits.|$|E
500|$|On 2 January 2012, Barton {{scored the}} opening goal in QPR's match against Norwich City, his second for the club. However, {{he was given}} a {{straight}} red card after head-butting Norwich midfielder Bradley Johnson, Barton's first dismissal since May 2009. With QPR down to ten men they went on to lose the match 2–1. When Warnock was replaced as manager by Mark Hughes in January 2012, Hughes confirmed that Barton would remain captain. Barton's performance in QPR's 3–2 home victory against Liverpool saw him booed by the QPR fans, who promptly cheered when he was substituted just after the hour mark. Barton admitted that his performance was [...] "awful" [...] and the [...] "worst I've ever played in my career" [...] but also criticised the QPR fans for not <b>sticking</b> <b>with</b> the team in their battle against relegation. After being dropped for the club's next match, an away defeat to Sunderland, he returned to the line-up for the home match against Arsenal. Barton led QPR to a 2–1 victory and he was cheered by the supporters and praised by Hughes, who described his performance as [...] "top-class". Barton's third goal for the club came in a 3–0 victory at home to Swansea on 11 April 2011.|$|E
500|$|Burns chose [...] "Lucky" [...] as [...] "the most {{impressive}} {{number of the}} evening", and Respers France called it the most adorable. Semigran and the Los Angeles Times Amy Reiter {{agreed that it was}} cute, and Flandez praised its [...] "charm and simplicity". Stack and Benigno gave it an [...] "A"; Stack eagerly anticipated more duets between Quinn and Sam, and Benigno called it [...] "absolutely fantastic", with particular praise for Agron, who he opined is often overlooked. Though Futterman also noted its charm, she did not think it was a worthy winner of the duets competition. Berk gave it just two stars out of five, as he found it [...] "kind of boring". The mash-up of [...] "Happy Days Are Here Again" [...] and [...] "Get Happy" [...] was widely acclaimed. Respers France, Reiter and Hankinson named it the musical highlight of the episode; Fallon and Stack went further and hailed it as a highlight of the entire series. Poniewozik commented that the number was [...] "so appropriate that, had it not existed, Glee probably would have had to invent it". Wieselman suggested that Colfer and Michele [...] "redefined show-stopper" [...] with their performance, and Itzkoff lauded it as [...] "a powerful reminder of why it's worth <b>sticking</b> <b>with</b> Glee through what has quickly proved a polarizing season." ...|$|E
