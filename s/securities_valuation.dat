40|$|Excerpt] <b>Security</b> <b>valuation</b> {{techniques}} {{have become increasingly}} sophisticated, as evidenced by advances in option pricing theory and Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT). Despite the availability of these paradigms, the price/earnings (P/E) approach to <b>security</b> <b>valuation</b> has maintained its popularity among practicing security analysts. Much of this lasting popularity {{can be attributed to}} the apparent simplicity of the P/E approach and the difficulties inherent in implementing complex valuation models. To implement the P/E approach, analysts must estimate the appropriate P/E multiple, which typically requires the development of a model. Unfortunately, most of the P/E models that have been developed use ad hoc empirical tests and historical data. One notable exception is a study by Cragg and Malkiel, which tested a theoretical P/E model using analysts 2 ̆ 7 forecasts for a nonrandom sample of 175 large firms. This note extends the work of Cragg and Malkiel in two ways. First, it is not restricted to large firms; all firms with complete data are included in the empirical tests.

We also find that the expected security returns implied by the expectations data are related to "systematic" risk measures appropriately defined.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multifactor arbitrage-free interest rate model, {{based on a}} binomial lattice framework, that avoids negative and unreasonable high interest rate levels, and the model provides interest rates movement {{that is consistent with}} historical interest rate experience. The model is tested empirically using monthly swaption prices over a one year sample period. The results show that the model can be calibrated to the observed swaption prices quite accurately. The model supports the two-factor model over the one-factor model, and suggests that the implied yield curve movements from the swaption prices are more akin to a normal model than a lognormal model. This interest rate model is specified by a set of difference equations and is therefore simple to implement. The recombining lattice also provides accuracy in pricing a broad range of interest rate contingent claims. For these reasons, the model has many applications in <b>securities</b> <b>valuation,</b> risk management and regulatory compliance...|$|E

40|$|We {{implement}} {{game and}} mechanism design theories {{to develop a}} network-wide autonomous consumer-centric and delay-efficient security protocol, DSIC-S. It induces a dominant strategy incentive compatible equilibrium among all rational and selfish nodes. We show that our protocol is network-wide socially desirable and Pareto optimal. DSIC-S guarantees the delivery of consumer's security services within desired levels, naturally and trustfully, reinforced by our nesting security model. We address resource management and delay-efficiency through synergy of several design aspects. We propose a scenario-based security model with different levels. We incorporate a valuation system to integrate the caused delay at each node in selection of security algorithms without consumer's knowledge of the actual delays. We achieve this by incorporating our valuation system, in particular that of the consumer's, in the calculation of the credit transfers with Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) payments and Clarke's pivotal rule. We prove that DSIC-S design solves the revelation theorem's problem of misrepresentation of agents' private information in mechanism design theory. We propose an incentive model and incorporate the valuations in these incentives. The simulations validate our theoretical results.

40|$|Background: The main {{topic of}} the master thesis is Valuation of Securities on Inactive Markets. Securities quoted on {{inactive}} market have been investigated to present how their fair value can be efficiently measured. Securities quoted on inactive market can have limited or unreliable inputs and the valuation process can become time and money consuming. Financial professional face similar problems while valuing financial assets on inactive markets. Relevance of the topic: The master thesis might be {{of particular interest to}} investment and asset management companies which can get an opportunity to share their experiences and gain from the knowledge exchange. Method: One asset management company and three audit companies have been contacted for collecting information from different perspectives. asset management company has practical experience on conducting valuation of inactively traded securities and audit companies suggest how valuation should be done. Results have been collected through surveys and interviews to all selected companies. Then the qualitative approach has been applied on the collected results. Main findings: Even though most of the answers to the questionnaire were different, as the companies followed generally accepted international standards, their view on the valuation of inactively traded securities was relatively common. Companies admitted that the main problems in the valuation of securities quoted on inactive market are the limited access to market quotes, high spreads on the market, unreliable market information, limited access to financial data of the valued companies and considerable amount of inactively traded <b>securities.</b> <b>Valuation</b> based on multiples is most commonly used by the companies.
