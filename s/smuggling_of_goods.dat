5|$|The {{boundary}} line was nonetheless still {{fairly easy to}} cross. Local inhabitants were able to maintain fields on the other side, or even to live {{on one side and}} work on the other. Refugees were able to sneak across or bribe the guards, and the <b>smuggling</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> in both directions was rife. The flow of emigrants remained large despite the increase in East German security measures: 675,000people fled to West Germany between 1949 and 1952.|$|E
5|$|Demolitions began {{soon after}} the {{withdrawal}} of the Jacobite threat in 1746. The bastions of the Telfer Wall along Lauriston Place were demolished in 1762, as they were obstructing traffic. The Netherbow survived until 1764, when it too was removed as an obstruction. The West Port and the Potterow Port were removed in the 1780s. By now, the New Town was under construction, and although <b>smuggling</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> through the city walls was still being punished, complaints about the zealousness of the guards were widely circulated. The Old College of the University of Edinburgh (constructed from 1789), and then the Royal Museum of Scotland (constructed from 1861), were built over sections of the wall around the Potterow Port. Forrest Road was laid out in the 1840s, resulting in the loss of another section of the Telfer Wall. During construction works around the Advocates' Library and Parliament House in 1832 and 1845, fragments of walling were uncovered, which were attributed to the King's Wall. Two sections of the increasingly neglected town wall collapsed in the mid-1850s. In 1854, a large portion of wall (20 feet high and 3–4 feet thick), and the embankment against which it was built fell into Leith Wynd between the High Street and Calton Road. A week later the Dean of Guild ordered the removal of a 150 feet stretch of the wall from that location. In 1856, a lightning strike appears to have been the cause of the collapse of a 40 to 50 feet stretch of the wall enclosing Greyfriars Kirkyard.|$|E

40|$|Earlier models <b>of</b> <b>smuggling</b> are {{deficient}} in their treatment {{of risk and}} transport costs. A model <b>of</b> <b>smuggling</b> <b>of</b> agricultural <b>goods</b> in an intra-EEC context is constructed, with due regard to such costs. <b>Smuggling</b> <b>of</b> agricultural <b>goods</b> is an increasing cost industry, not because of unspecified or unplausible externalities, as in earlier papers, but because of increasing transport costs as the extensive margin <b>of</b> source-locations for <b>smuggled</b> <b>goods</b> is expanded. In consequence, intra-marginal smugglers can earn economic rents. The theoretical model is supported by empirical studies of trade between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland...|$|R

25|$|The {{advantage}} of the free port was added to with the <b>smuggling</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> mainly from France during the wars with France, were in high demand in England. Goods such as brandy, perfume, lace and wine. Even goods such as salt were smuggled, as {{it was impossible to}} tell the origin of that commodity, landing salt in England and claiming its manufacture in the Islands and tax free as against French salt, which was taxed. France also had a tax until 1790, the gabelle of 140 times the cost of production, so producers wanted to export. In 1795 England arrested 10,000 people for salt smuggling.|$|E
25|$|The royal {{administration}} also quickly ruined its reputation with the Parisians. They {{decided to build}} a new wall around Paris, not to keep invaders out, but to stop the <b>smuggling</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> into Paris past the tax collectors, merchandise coming into the city. The wall, called the Wall of the Farmers-General, was twenty-five kilometers long, four to five meters high, and had fifty-six gates where taxes had to be paid. Portions of the wall can still be seen at Place Denfert-Rochereau and Place de la Nation, and one of the toll gates in the Parc Monceau. The wall and the taxes were highly unpopular, and, along with shortages of bread, fueled the growing discontent.|$|E
50|$|The APTTA {{calls for}} various {{measures}} to counter <b>smuggling</b> <b>of</b> duty-free <b>goods</b> into both Pakistan and Afghanistan by mandating: tracking devices <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> banking guarantees and special bonded carrier licenses for transit trucks, vehicular tracking systems, and container security deposits.|$|R
50|$|The slower {{progress}} in economy, dysfunctional production system, <b>smuggling</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> through {{the border and}} syndication among the traders who had been enjoying substantial support including licenses from the ruling Awami League since independence led the country to a famine in 1974 that claimed at least 1.5 million lives. Estimates from some renowned economists including Dr. Amartya Sen however suggest the death toll much larger. A sudden flood {{in the same year}} made the situation much worse leaving hundreds to die of starving.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{economic}} blockade enforced by Napoléon, {{the economy of the}} Kingdom of Holland was further ruined; the <b>smuggling</b> <b>of</b> British <b>goods</b> increased. Louis hesitated to oppose this, which led Napoléon to sending units of Douanes Imperiales to Holland.|$|R
2500|$|In Poland's {{cities and}} larger towns, the Nazi {{occupiers}} created ghettos {{that were designed}} to imprison the local Jewish populations. The food rations allocated by the Germans to the ghettos condemned their inhabitants to starvation. Smuggling of food into the ghettos and <b>smuggling</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> out of the ghettos, organized by Jews and Poles, was {{the only means of}} subsistence of the Jewish population in the ghettos. The price difference between the Aryan [...] and Jewish sides was large, reaching as much as 100%, but the penalty for aiding Jews was death. Hundreds of Polish and Jewish smugglers would come in and out the ghettos, usually at night or at dawn, through openings in the walls, underground tunnels and sewers or through the guardposts by paying bribes.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} of the police was the <b>smuggling</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> especially wine, into the city past the Wall of the Ferme générale, built around the city between 1784 and 1791, where merchants were supposed to pay customs duties. Many smugglers used tunnels under the wall; seventeen tunnels were discovered in 1801 and 1802; one tunnel between Chaillot and Passy was three hundred meters long. Sixty barrels of wine were seized in one tunnel during the same period. Many taverns and guingettes, appeared just outside the walls, particularly {{in the village of}} Montmartre, where the untaxed drinks were much cheaper than in the city. The city administration was eventually able to defeat the smugglers by giving higher salaries to the customs agents at the gates, rotating them regularly, and tearing down buildings close to the walls, from which the smugglers operated.|$|E
2500|$|The Dutch West India {{company was}} {{abolished}} in 1791, and its colonies in Suriname and the Caribbean brought under the direct {{rule of the}} state. [...] The economies of the Dutch colonies in the Caribbean had been based on the <b>smuggling</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and slaves into Spanish America, but {{with the end of}} the slave trade in 1814 and the independence of the new nations of South and Central America from Spain, profitability rapidly declined. [...] Dutch traders moved en masse from the islands to the United States or Latin America, leaving behind small populations with little income and which required subsidies from the Dutch government. [...] The Antilles were combined under one administration with Suriname from 1828 to 1845. [...] Slavery was not abolished in the Dutch Caribbean colonies until 1863, long after those of Britain and France, though by this time only 6,500 slaves remained. [...] In Suriname, slave holders demanded compensation from the Dutch government for freeing slaves, whilst in Sint Maarten, abolition of slavery in the French half in 1848 led slaves in the Dutch half to take their own freedom. [...] In Suriname, after the abolition of slavery, Chinese workers were encouraged to immigrate as indentured laborers, as were Javanese, between 1890 and 1939.|$|E

30|$|Bidokhti and Zargar {{concluded}} {{that more than}} 95 % of the total manufacturing units in Iran are small and medium-sized enterprises, {{but they do not}} have significant contribution in gross national production and creation of value added and suffer from severe deficiencies.

Old machinery, high interest rates of facilities, vagueness of some business and commercial rules, an increase in intermediaries, the wide <b>smuggle</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> to the country, the large number of current foreign competitors in the market, the welcome of consumers from foreign products, the traditional activities in the field of industry and the lack of economic, financial and management knowledge, especially at the establishment time have been reported as problems in this regard (Bidokhti and Zargar, 2011).|$|R
