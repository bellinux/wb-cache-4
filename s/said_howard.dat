2500|$|On August 14, 2008, {{real estate}} mogul Donald Trump {{announced}} that he would purchase McMahon's home from Countrywide Financial and lease it to McMahon, so the home would not be foreclosed. McMahon agreed instead to a deal with a private buyer for his hilltop home, <b>said</b> <b>Howard</b> Bragman, McMahon's former spokesman. Bragman declined to name the buyer or the selling price, but he said it is not Trump. [...] "For Mr. Trump, this acquisition was not business-related, but, as he has stated, was meant to help out an American icon," [...] said Michael Cohen, special counsel to Trump. [...] "If another buyer should emerge who will create the benefit Mr. Trump sought for Ed McMahon, then he is clearly pleased." [...] In early September, after the second buyer's offer fell through, Trump renewed his offer to purchase the home.|$|E
6000|$|... "A seat," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Howard</b> impatiently, and in {{a moment}} the flaxen-bearded man had a chair behind Graham. [...] "Sit down, please," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Howard.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Was it {{a social}} trouble--that--in the great roadway place? How are you governed? Have you still a police?" [...] "Several," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Howard.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Rudd <b>said</b> that <b>Howard</b> had [...] "no {{plan for}} the future" [...] on {{tackling}} climate change. <b>Howard</b> <b>said</b> that a Coalition government would establish a climate change fund after 2011, which would be financed by carbon offsets.|$|R
5000|$|During his administration, it was <b>said</b> that <b>Howard</b> had the {{greatest}} collection of African American scholars to be found anywhere. Notable scholars at Howard included: ...|$|R
500|$|Orson Welles in an {{interview}} with Peter Bogdanovich <b>said</b> of <b>Howard</b> Hawks, in comparison with John Ford, that [...] "Hawks is great prose; Ford is poetry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not this rubbish," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Howard.</b> [...] "Judging by {{the fuss}} she {{made over the}} inventory, you'd {{think it might be}} worth something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would pass}} the time," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Howard.</b> [...] "It {{is a thing}} I should perhaps have thought of before, but, {{as a matter of}} fact, so much is happening--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is better," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Howard.</b> [...] "Yes, {{that is much}} better. And I {{must leave}} you alone. For a space. While I attend the {{discussion}} in the Council. I am sorry." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was an {{electrical}} surprise. No one {{was prepared for}} such an admission. A buzz of astonishment rose on all sides, and people were heard to intimate that the overworked lawyer had lost his mind. Even the veteran judge, accustomed as he was to legal ambushes and masked batteries in criminal procedure, was not sure that his ears were not deceiving him, and asked counsel what it was he had <b>said.</b> <b>Howard's</b> impassive face betrayed no sign, but his attitude and bearing lost something of their careless confidence for a moment. Wilson resumed: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By George, that's {{going it}} strong!" [...] <b>said</b> young <b>Howard.</b> [...] "You've {{got to believe}} that a man like Richet has seen {{something}} after three months' experiment in his own house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Plain as a pikestaff to me," [...] <b>said</b> Miss <b>Howard</b> shortly. [...] "It shows clearly {{enough that}} my poor old friend had {{just found out}} she'd been made a fool of!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have our}} troubles," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Howard.</b> His eyes avoided Graham's enquiry. [...] "This {{is a time}} of unrest. And, in fact, your appearance, your waking just now, has a sort of connexion--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it's really remarkable. They seem to lack {{all power}} {{of looking at}} things impersonally. They simply go over and over the same talk about Fords and the weather and so on." [...] <b>said</b> <b>Howard</b> Littlefield.|$|E
6000|$|... "All in good time, Sire," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Howard.</b> [...] "But not crudely, not crudely. This is one {{of those}} flimsy times when no man has a settled mind. Your awakening--no one {{expected}} your awakening. The Council is consulting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps it is," [...] <b>said</b> Lord <b>Howard.</b> [...] "And after all, gentlemen, {{what can}} this man gain by a lie, {{which must be}} {{discovered}} ere a day is over, except a more certain hanging?" ...|$|R
5000|$|On the {{occasion}} of his 80th birthday, the then Prime Minister John <b>Howard</b> <b>said</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] <b>said</b> Cecilia <b>Howard,</b> timidly {{approaching}} {{the spot where}} her uncle stood, a disdainful witness of the dissensions among his captors; [...] "then will I go with him! He shall never be a resident among his enemies alone!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll {{start on}} a career of crime, I will,' <b>said</b> <b>Howard</b> Fry - He spake and acted! Deeds of bale (With which I do not stain my tale) He wrought like mad time after time, Yet wrought them blushfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "All in good time, Sire," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Howard.</b> [...] "But not crudely, not crudely. This is one {{of those}} flimsy times when no man has a settled mind. Your awakening. No one {{expected}} your awakening. The Council is consulting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Honora {{has got a}} wild notion {{into her}} head that I'm {{going to take the}} Farnham house," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Howard,</b> smiling. There, {{on the deck of the}} ferryboat, in the {{flooding}} sunlight, the idea seemed to give him amusement. With the morning light Pharaoh must have hardened his heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would never}} suppose," [...] <b>said</b> Irene <b>Howard</b> to Olive Kirk afterwards, [...] "that Walter {{had left for}} the front only this morning. But some people really have no depth of feeling. I often wish I could take things as lightly as Rilla Blythe." ...|$|R
2500|$|The then Prime Minister of Australia, John <b>Howard</b> <b>said</b> {{his message}} to the miners would be [...] "Everybody is with you, mate".|$|R
5000|$|Australia's {{immigration}} policies towards asylum seekers were a significant {{issue in the}} 2001 federal election. <b>Howard</b> <b>said</b> in a campaign policy speech: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is another}} testimony," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Howard,</b> approvingly. [...] "That {{young man is}} fine all through. He wishes to save his brother the sorrow of {{fighting}} on the Sabbath, and he is right; {{it is the right}} and manly feeling and does him credit. We will make all possible haste." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hang it," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Howard,</b> [...] "I can't {{see what}} you're driving at. I'm not {{throwing}} you into his arms. I'm merely {{asking you to}} be friendly with him. It means a good deal to me--to both of us. And besides, you {{can take care of}} yourself. You're not the sort of woman to play the fool." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's divorced," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Howard.</b> And {{she had to}} {{be content}} with so much of the gentleman's biography, for her husband relapsed into {{somnolence}} again. A few days later she saw a picture of Mr. Brent, in polo costume, in one of the magazines. She thought him good-looking, and wondered what kind of a wife he had had.|$|E
5000|$|The then Prime Minister of Australia, John <b>Howard</b> <b>said</b> {{his message}} to the miners would be [...] "Everybody is with you, mate".|$|R
50|$|Firm {{evidence}} of Jeffries’s race and age {{is hard to}} come by, but census documents from 1920 described him as mulatto and listed his father as a black man named Howard Jeffrey. Jeffries himself, late in life, <b>said</b> that <b>Howard</b> Jeffrey was his stepfather, and his biological father was Domenico Balentino, a Sicilian who died in World War I.|$|R
5000|$|The Used were {{supposed}} to release a live album in early 2006, {{but one of the}} people in charge of filming mysteriously disappeared with much of the footage that was earmarked {{to be part of the}} DVD. The band was forced to come up with more footage, but in the long run Jeph <b>Howard</b> <b>said</b> it all turned out for the best. [...] "I’m glad we waited. It's better than our first DVD", <b>Howard</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "Everything has been going like that lately. It's been more than good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There isn't {{any doubt}} about that," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Howard,</b> and added, in a grieved tone, [...] "but what an unworthy sort of Christian that Angelo is--I hope and believe {{there are not many}} like him. It is not right to engage in a duel on the Sabbath--I could not approve of that myself; but to finish one that has been begun--that is a duty, let the day be what it may." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{was no way}} to mend it," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Howard,</b> whose ear {{was being}} readjusted now by the doctor; [...] "the code fixes our place, and {{it would not have been}} lawful to change it. If we could have stood at your side, or behind you, or in front of you, it--but it would not have been {{legitimate}} and the other parties would have had a just right to complain of our trying to protect ourselves from danger; infractions of the code are certainly not permissible in any case whatever." ...|$|E
50|$|In March 2013, {{following}} being temporarily {{dropped from}} the national team Shane Watson <b>said</b> <b>Howard</b> had not been involved in cricket long enough to pass comment on {{his commitment to the}} Australian team.|$|E
50|$|Notable by {{its absence}} is any firm {{commitment}} to reducing tax. In his {{speech at the}} party conference, <b>Howard</b> <b>said</b> {{that he would not}} make promises he could not keep.|$|R
5000|$|Bryce Dallas <b>Howard</b> <b>said</b> {{she would}} love {{to be a part of}} any {{continuation}} of the film franchise, while acknowledging her character's opportunity may have passed, especially after Spider-Man 3 ended with Peter and Mary Jane once again in each other’s arms. In May 2007, actor James Cromwell, who played Captain Stacy in the film stated he thought the natural progression for the character would be for both to die early in Spider-Man 4, mirroring the comics. <b>Howard</b> <b>said</b> a death would not have bothered her. The film was ultimately unmade, although Stacy was in the draft.|$|R
5000|$|Prime Minister of Australia, John <b>Howard,</b> <b>said</b> he and Mrs Howard were {{saddened by}} Emmett's death. [...] "She fought a very courageous battle against cancer", <b>Howard</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "On behalf of Janette and myself, I extend my deepest sympathies to her husband, Rove McManus, {{and her family}} and friends." [...] Opposition Leader Kim Beazley also passed on his sympathies. [...] "This is truly sad news which I think will affect all Australians", Beazley said. [...] "The {{tenderness}} and care in their relationship (Rove and Belinda) through their adversity, I think, has been an inspiration to many, many Australians." ...|$|R
