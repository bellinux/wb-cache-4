5|$|In the 2012 film , the Pyramid Head, {{once more}} portrayed by Roberto Campanella, {{is both a}} monster and a guardian. More than once, it saves Sharon from the forces of Silent Hill. This is {{explained}} by its loyalty to Alessa: since Heather is the good half of Alessa's soul, it <b>sees</b> <b>them</b> as the same being and is thus bound to protect both from harm.

Stannis refuses to seek an alliance with Robb Stark or Renly Baratheon, despite the advice of his advisor Ser Davos Seaworth, because he <b>sees</b> <b>them</b> as usurpers; Stannis insists that all will bend the knee to him or be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard gameplay, the player {{will also have to}} defeat the games' main antagonist force, Team Plasma, a Knights Templar-esque group who claim that Pokémon are oppressed by humanity and seek to liberate them from their trainers. Team Plasma is led by N, a young man who was brought up alongside Pokémon and <b>sees</b> <b>them</b> as friends rather than tools for sport. Throughout the game, the player has some encounters with N, who claims that by capturing one of the legendary Pokémon (Reshiram and Zekrom) of Unova and defeating the Pokémon Champion Alder, he will be recognized as Unova's hero and will be able to convince the humans to part with their Pokémon. Depending on the game version, N will capture Zekrom in Black or Reshiram in White.|$|E
5|$|King Leopold, {{on holiday}} in Paris, wants to visit Monte Carlo, {{but does not}} have time for the seventeen-hour express train ride between the two cities.

A large crowd <b>sees</b> <b>them</b> off from outside the Paris Opera House, including many celebrities from the Paris theatre world. After stopping to fill the car with gas, the King starts it and, from inexperience, accidentally runs it backward over a policeman, who is squashed flat as a pancake. The King starts inflating him with a pump, and then, to save time, lets other onlookers finish the job while he drives off. The onlookers set to the work with gusto, {{so much so that}} the overinflated policeman ends up exploding.|$|E

5|$|Similar to the Moor-Christian {{confrontation}} of the morisca—whether in Spain or in transplanted versions in Central America—there are also elaborate ritual dances in Mexico {{such as the}} Danza de la Pluma that exploit {{the trauma of the}} Spanish conquest of indigenous America. Weapons employed may be swords (and shields) whips, even firearms. These representations take place over a large area of Mesoamerica and, in part, are an obvious adaptation of Spanish tradition, but in Mexico will pit the native Aztec against the Spanish invader. The most interesting aspect of these dances is that—depending on where one <b>sees</b> <b>them</b> and under what conditions—it is plausible to read into the dances an outcome other than the historical Spanish victory. That is, indigenous performers may take inspiration {{from the fact that the}} natives of Spain drove out the Moorish invaders; thus, the natives of Mesoamerica, too, shall one day drive out the invaders.|$|E
5|$|Since then Kasahara has {{proposed}} a definition between these two. He agrees with Hata that Chinese soldiers actively engaged in combat were not massacre victims, but he also includes in his definition of the massacre any Chinese soldiers who were killed on the battlefield but not actively resisting, noting that many confrontations between the Chinese and Japanese Armies were more like one-sided slaughters than battles. For instance, after routing the Chinese in Nanking, Japanese soldiers fired upon and killed {{a large number of}} Chinese soldiers who were attempting to escape the battlefield by swimming across the Yangtze River. Many historians including Kasahara view incidents like these where the Japanese fired upon retreating troops to be atrocities, whereas Hata <b>sees</b> <b>them</b> as extensions of combat and not massacres.|$|E

Eventually, she becomes caught up in raggy toilet paper and cannot talk properly (due to eating stale bubble gum), which leads to the boys mistaking her for the mummy and capturing her.|$|E

Maggie also explains that Golda had told the parents that a ritual should be performed to separate the spirits of the twins, but Steve refused. Charlie has another seizure and is hospitalized. Michael knocks out the nurse and afterward convinces Maggie, by pretending to be Charlie, to take him home. Scully <b>sees</b> <b>them</b> leaving, and checks on Charlie.

This forces her to resort to using her Magic Biker Cap to call Sal Minella and the other Flying Monkeys (played by Sweetums, Crazy Harry, Black Dog, Calico, Old Tom, Spotted Dick, and Aretha from Fraggle Rock) to deal with them. The Witch and the Flying Monkeys capture Dorothy and Lion while Scarecrow and Tin Thing are dismantled by the Flying Monkeys.|$|E
