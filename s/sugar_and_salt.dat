5|$|High {{levels of}} both <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> can {{preserve}} food by preventing micro-organisms from growing. Green beans can be salted by layering the pods with salt, but {{this method of}} preservation is unsuited to most vegetables. Marrows, beetroot, carrot, and some other vegetables can be boiled with sugar to create jams. Vinegar is widely used in food preservation; a sufficient concentration of acetic acid prevents the development of destructive micro-organisms, a fact made use of {{in the preparation of}} pickles, chutneys and relishes. Fermentation is another method of preserving vegetables for later use. Sauerkraut is made from chopped cabbage and relies on lactic acid bacteria which produce compounds that are inhibitory to the growth of other micro-organisms.|$|E

40|$|Disinfestation of orchid seeds is {{necessary}} when the germination is performed in vitro. In such case, cultures are supplemented by {{a source of}} <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> <b>salts</b> {{in order to obtain}} energy and other requirements. However, the presence of <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> <b>salts</b> easily allows the development of unwanted microorganisms. To avoid such phenomenon, an efficient procedure must be done as a pretreatment of the seeds with liquid or gaseous substances. In this study with several Brazilian orchids, the seeds were disinfested with sodium hypochlorite solutions containing 0. 4 % or 0. 8 % active chlorine for five minutes and sodium hypochlorite or formaldehyde fumes up to two hours, this procedure being efficient for such purpose and making it possible to be used routinely...|$|R

25|$|Drinks {{especially}} high in simple sugars, such as {{soft drinks and}} fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase dehydration. A too rich solution in the gut draws water {{from the rest of}} the body, just as if the person were to drink sea water. Plain water may be used if more specific and effective ORT preparations are unavailable or are not palatable. Additionally, a mix of both plain water and drinks perhaps too rich in <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> can alternatively be given to the same person, with the goal of providing a medium amount of sodium overall. A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted.|$|E
25|$|The first soldier ration {{established}} by a Congressional Resolution, during the Revolutionary War, consisted of {{enough food to}} feed a man for one day, mostly beef, peas, and rice. During the Civil War, the military moved toward canned goods. Later, self-contained kits were issued as a whole ration and contained canned meat, bread, coffee, <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> <b>salt.</b> During the First World War, canned meats were replaced with lightweight preserved meats (salted or dried) to save weight and allow more rations to be carried by soldiers carrying their supplies on foot. At the beginning of World War II, {{a number of new}} field rations were introduced, including the Mountain ration and the Jungle ration. However, cost-cutting measures by Quartermaster Command officials during the latter part of World War II and the Korean War again saw the predominance of heavy canned C rations issued to troops, regardless of operating environment or mission. The use of canned wet rations continued through the Vietnam War, with the improved MCI field ration.|$|E
25|$|People {{who suffer}} from dysgeusia are also forced to manage the impact that the {{disorder}} has on their quality of life. An altered taste has effects on food choice and intake {{and can lead to}} weight loss, malnutrition, impaired immunity, and a decline in health. Patients diagnosed with dysgeusia must use caution when adding <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> to food and must be sure not to overcompensate for their lack of taste with excess amounts. Since the elderly are often on multiple medications, they are at risk for taste disturbances increasing the chances of developing depression, loss of appetite, and extreme weight loss. This is cause for an evaluation and management of their dysgeusia. In patients undergoing chemotherapy, taste distortions can often be severe and make compliance with cancer treatment difficult. Other problems that may arise include anorexia and behavioral changes that can be misinterpreted as psychiatric delusions regarding food. Symptoms including paranoia, amnesia, cerebellar malfunction, and lethargy can also manifest when undergoing histidine treatment. This makes it critical that these patients' dysgeusia is either treated or managed in order to improve their quality of life.|$|E

2500|$|Obesity: Obesity is a {{paramount}} problem, {{especially among}} the poor and socially disadvantaged, in cities worldwide, according to the WHO (Hawkes et al., 2007; Friel, Chopra & Satcher, 2007). The increased amount of obesity can be contributed to the nutrition transition that describes how people are now increasingly turning to high-fat, <b>sugar,</b> <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> food sources because of their availability and price. [...] This food transition has fueled the obesity epidemic. This nutrition transition tends to start in cities because of [...] "greater availability, accessibility, and acceptability of bulk purchases, convenience foods, and 'supersized' portions" [...] (Dixon et al., 2007). [...] Physical activity and exercise is strongly determined by the design of cities, including density of homes, heterogeneous land uses, {{the extent to which}} streets and sidewalks connect, the walkability, and the provision of and access to local public accommodations and parks for recreation and play. [...] These factors, along with increasing reliance on cars, results in the shift of the population toward physical inactivity, which damages health (Friel, Chopra & Satcher, 2007).|$|E

40|$|The osmotolerant and halotolerant {{food yeast}} Zygosaccharomyces rouxii {{is known for}} its ability to grow and survive in the face of stress caused by high {{concentrations}} of non-ionic (<b>sugars</b> <b>and</b> polyols) and ionic (mainly Na(+) cations) solutes. This ability determines the success of fermentation on high osmolarity food matrices and leads to spoilage of high <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> high <b>salt</b> foods. The knowledge about the genes, the metabolic pathways, and the regulatory circuits shaping the Z. rouxii <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> salt-tolerance, is a prerequisite to develop effective strategies for fermentation control, optimization of food starter culture, and prevention of food spoilage. This review summarizes recent insights on the mechanisms used by Z. rouxii and other osmo and halotolerant food yeasts to endure <b>salts</b> <b>and</b> <b>sugars</b> stresses. Using the information gathered from S. cerevisiae as guide, we highlight how these non-conventional yeasts integrate general and osmoticum-specific adaptive responses under <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> <b>salts</b> stresses, including regulation of Na(+) and K(+) -fluxes across the plasma membrane, modulation of cell wall properties, compatible osmolyte production and accumulation, and stress signalling pathways. We suggest how an integrated and system-based knowledge on these mechanisms may impact food and biotechnological industries, by improving the yeast spoilage control in food, enhancing the yeast-based bioprocess yields, and engineering the osmotolerance in other organisms...|$|R
2500|$|This {{worldwide}} primacy {{in trade}} {{would not have}} been possible if it only rested on Dutch primacy in the carrying trade. After all, one has to trade something. Even where the counterparty is primarily interested in gold and silver as means of exchange, as in South-East Asia, that specie must be earned by a surplus on the balance of payments with other trading partners. A surplus in [...] "invisibles", like shipping services, would not suffice to cover the enormous financing requirement of the spice trade. At first, the Dutch had little indigenous to offer, beyond herring and dairy products. But the industrial revolution of the early 17th century brought an industry into being that by the 1640s had matured enough to play an important part in Dutch exports. This industrial growth was partly innovation driven, stimulating all kinds of heretofore not seen mechanization, that greatly enhanced labor productivity, thereby driving down prices for Dutch products, even while nominal wages rose steeply at the same time. But the commerce-engendered Dutch control of many raw-material markets (like Spanish and Turkish raw wool, Swedish iron and copper, Ibero-American dyestuffs, Portuguese salt, French wine, Baltic grain, Scandinavian tar and wood, Caribbean sugar, American tobacco etc.) was an important factor in stimulating the booms of the industries that used those materials: textiles, guns, vinegar, shipbuilding, <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> refining, tobacco blending, to name only a few. [...] The Dutch entrepot was therefore supplied by an important domestic industrial sector, and not limited to reexporting wares obtained abroad. Industry and commerce were in this period closely integrated (though in later stages of the Dutch economy they would become disaggregated again, when foreign protection and a structurally high real-wage level forced the decline of the Dutch industrial sector).|$|E

In the Fourth Army Tactical Notes of May 1916, battalions were allowed to attack on a front of [...] in [...] about [...] apart. Supporting lines were {{to pass through the}} leading ones, to avoid excessive demands on the energy and ability of individual soldiers. Weight of numbers was rejected as a tactic; each platoon was to carry half the burden of a brigade attack for a few minutes, before being relieved by a fresh wave. Platoons were divided into functions, fighting, mopping-up, support and carrying; the fighting platoons were to press on as the moppers-up secured the ground behind them. Support and carrying platoons could pick their way through artillery barrages with the tools and weapons needed to consolidate and defeat German counter-attacks. Some troops in carrying platoons had about [...] of equipment and tools, whereas troops in the advanced platoons carried a rifle, bayonet, [...] of ammunition, iron ration (an emergency ration of preserved food, tea, <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> <b>salt),</b> two grenades, pick, shovel or entrenching tool, four empty sandbags, two gas helmets, wire cutters, a smoke candle and a water-bottle. In the French army, the experience of 1915 showed that despite the power of French bombardments, infantry would enter a chaotic environment, full of German pockets of resistance and individuals who had been by-passed. By mid-1916 much of the French infantry in the Sixth Army had been trained as specialists, as rifle-and-bayonet men, bombers, rifle grenadiers or light machine-gun crews. Attacking waves were spread wider and companies trained to manoeuvre in small groups, to get behind surviving German defences, as [...] (trench cleaners) armed with hand-grenades and revolvers, searched captured ground for stray Germans and hidden machine-gunners, although such methods did not come into general use until later in the year.|$|E
