Bill Mather-Brown, an Australian athlete, said [...] "The 1962 Games was the first time I had been asked for an autograph. We regarded it as a compliment. We were mobbed, especially at the swimming pool. Sometimes we [...] were not <b>sure</b> <b>people</b> really wanted our signature or were just being polite and wanted us to feel good".|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers {{expected}} that Girls' Generation would achieve success with their electropop music styles following their appearance on US television. Mio Scobie, editor of Us Weekly wrote that [...] "They produce feelgood beats, instantly memorable choruses and, as I'm <b>sure</b> <b>people</b> have already noticed, they're stunning." [...] McClure's Asia Music News writer Steve McClure also {{anticipated that the}} group would succeed on the Western music scene, saying that [...] "I {{have a feeling that}} Girls' Generation will stick round for a while." ...|$|E

Annie stated that while promoting the album, she wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>people</b> knew of her involvement in the album's writing and production. Of its twelve songs, ten were co-written by Annie. [...] She stated that although singing songs written by someone else might not feel less personal, [...] "It's special to be on the stage and actually sing something you had done." [...] With respect to her involvement in the songwriting process, Annie referred to herself as [...] "a bit of a control freak".|$|E

500|$|Eckhart {{has talked}} {{much about his}} beliefs, his way of life, and his future career ambitions. Talking to Entertainment Weekly {{regarding}} his Mormon faith, he revealed, [...] "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>people</b> think I'm a Mormon, but I don't know that I'm a Mormon anymore, you know? To be honest, to be perfectly clear, I'd be a hypocrite if I did say that I was, just because I haven't lived that lifestyle for so many years." [...] In other interviews, {{he has said that}} hypnosis helped him to quit drinking, smoking, and partying, and that he undertakes amateur photography in his spare time. In an interview with Parade magazine, Eckhart revealed that before he discovered acting, he wanted to become a songwriter.|$|E
500|$|Edmondson has {{discussed}} the surprised reaction he encountered upon assuming {{the role of}} Abra, stating: [...] "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>people</b> are surprised I'm in it, but I don't give a toss. I have always liked it. It's like any soap - if you watch it, you get stuck in. I love working on it." [...] He has mentioned {{that he is the}} only cast member to have been a fan of the show since its 1999 conception, that both he and his youngest daughter Freya often watch it together [...] "as a bonding exercise", and going as far as to describe the role as [...] "a dream". Commenting on his decision only ever to reprise the role of Abra on short term contracts, Edmondson has stated that: [...] "I don't think I could handle any longer. The regulars on the show work very, very hard. Basically I don't think I could do what they do and still be alive." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{longtime}} {{advocate of}} health care reform, Neal {{was involved in the}} major health care reform efforts of 1993–94 and 2009–10. In working on the unsuccessful Clinton health care plan of 1993 he balanced his desire for health care reform with the interests of the major health insurance and medical companies in his district, achieving a compromise allowing insurance companies to charge small businesses higher premiums. He was later involved writing the House's 2009 health care reform bill, the Affordable Health Care for America Act. As chairman of the Select Revenue Measures subcommittee, he had a hand in developing the bill's financing plan. He explained that his priorities were to address [...] "pre-existing conditions, capping out-of-pocket expenses and making <b>sure</b> <b>people</b> don't lose their health care if they lose their job". Despite his support for the act, he spoke about his preference for a [...] "piecemeal" [...] approach to health care reform, saying it would allow for a more reasonable debate.|$|E

[...] Additionally, she noted that: [...] "Angelina may {{have a little bit}} of a crush on Kevin and she is not afraid to show it." [...] CBS Soaps In Depth wrote: [...] "viewers definitely can expect Angelina to make her mark in Genoa City." [...] DeGarmo confessed that she never watched daytime soap operas because she was in school, but her family was [...] "super excited" [...] about seeing her on one. Because she never had experience working on soaps, she talked about how fast-paced it was, stating: [...] "I would equate this to guerrilla theater. It’s very fast. You do your presentation and you’re done. It keeps me on my toes. I have to give my best performance at that very moment." [...] She also discussed having crossed over in the genre: [...] "Sometimes being a ‘reality’ person can be a bit of a stigma. ‘The Young and the Restless’ was willing to take a chance on me. They are so fantastic." ...|$|E
2500|$|TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald was {{published}} by Warner Books on October 26, 2005. Sales increased after Trump's lawsuit was filed against O'Brien. On Amazon.com, the book's sales ranking went from 123,329 to 466. However, O'Brien later said in March 2016 that the book [...] "didn't sell particularly well." [...] Trump took some credit for the low sales, stating, [...] "I didn't read the book. I didn't have time to read it. What I did do was make <b>sure</b> <b>people</b> knew it was false." ...|$|E

2500|$|Among the ACA's other provisions, Price {{is opposed}} to the bill's elimination, under most health {{insurance}} plans, of co-pays for birth control. Price defended his position on this issue in a 2012 interview, by suggesting {{that there are no}} women in the country who have ever struggled to pay for birth control. He said, [...] "Bring me one woman who has been left behind. Bring me one. There's not one." [...] Numerous media outlets have refuted this assertion. In 2017, during his confirmation hearing to become Secretary of Health and Human Services, Price was questioned about this comment and responded, [...] ""What I meant is that when I had patients in my office who could not afford a medication we did everything we could to make sure they could have it. There are avenues in the heath care system that doctors and hospitals take to make <b>sure</b> <b>people</b> can get the health care they need." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon his death, Jim Wolpert, {{the head}} of the {{department}} of viticulture and enology at University of California Davis said [...] "The debt of gratitude that we in the research community owe to him is immeasurable. He will be missed in ways that I don't think we all understand yet. There was no question about his reputation. His approach was always a no-nonsense, no-politics approach. He never let the main issues get sidetracked." [...] John De Luca, President of the Wine Institute said [...] "I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>people</b> truly perceive his extraordinary impact on the wine industry. He is one of the defining figures, one of the great figures in wine of our time." [...] Patrick Gleeson, executive director of the American Vineyard Foundation, who Meyer had mentored as a young lad said [...] "His vision and love for wine has undoubtedly made him a living legacy amongst friends, peers and those in the industry. Justin's passing will not diminish the influence he has had on the wine industry and hopefully it will inspire others to follow in his footsteps." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was very}} extraordinary. They were so {{completely}} identified, {{the one with}} the other, that the curiosity of the whole row—even of the old lady herself—was roused almost beyond endurance. The subject was discussed at every little card-table and tea-drinking. The old gentleman of silk-worm notoriety did not hesitate to express his decided opinion that Mr. Robinson was of Eastern descent, and contemplated marrying the whole family at once; and the row, generally, shook their heads with considerable gravity, and declared the business to be very mysterious. They hoped it might all end well;—it certainly had a very singular appearance, but still it would be uncharitable to express any opinion without good grounds to go upon, and certainly the Miss Willises were quite old enough to judge for themselves, and to be <b>sure</b> <b>people</b> ought to know their own business best, and so forth.|$|E
60|$|Sometimes this dawn of {{consciousness}} is {{preceded by a}} long twilight of soul-awakening; but sometimes, upon more sensitive and subtler natures, the light breaks with all the suddenness of a sunrise at the equator, revealing to the mind's eye an unsuspected world of self within. But in whatever way we may awake to it, the sense of personality, when first realized, appears already, like the fabled Goddess of Wisdom, full grown in the brain. From the moment when we first remember ourselves {{we seem to be}} as old as we ever seem to others afterwards to become. We grow, indeed, in knowledge, in wisdom, in experience, as our years increase, but deep down in our heart of hearts we are still essentially the same. To be <b>sure,</b> <b>people</b> pay us more deference than they did, which suggests a doubt at times whether we may not have changed; small boys of a succeeding generation treat us with a respect that causes us inwardly to smile, as we think how little we differ from them, if they but knew it. For at bottom we are not conscious of change from that morning, long ago, when first we realized ourselves. We feel just as young now as we felt old then. We are but amused at the world's discrimination where we can detect no difference.|$|E
60|$|But {{besides the}} natural sweets, {{we have also}} taken to {{producing}} artificial ones. Has any housewife ever realised the alarming condition of cookery in the benighted generations before the invention of sugar? It is really almost too appalling to think about. So many things that we now look upon as all but necessaries--cakes, puddings, made dishes, confectionery, preserves, sweet biscuits, jellies, cooked fruits, tarts, and so forth--were then practically quite impossible. Fancy attempting nowadays to live a single day without sugar; no tea, no coffee, no jam, no pudding, no cake, no sweets, no hot toddy before one goes to bed; the bare idea of it is too terrible. And yet {{that was really the}} abject condition of all the civilised world up {{to the middle of the}} middle ages. Horace's punch was sugarless and lemonless; the gentle Virgil never tasted the congenial cup of afternoon tea; and Socrates went from his cradle to his grave without ever knowing the flavour of peppermint bull's eyes. How the children managed to spend their Saturday as, or their weekly obolus, is a profound mystery. To be <b>sure,</b> <b>people</b> had honey; but honey is rare, dear, and scanty; it can never have filled one quarter the place that sugar fills in our modern affections. Try for a moment to realise drinking honey with one's whisky-and-water, or doing the year's preserving with a pot of best Narbonne, and you get at once a common measure of the difference between the two as practical sweeteners. Nowadays, we get sugar from cane and beet-root in abundance, while sugar-maples and palm-trees of various sorts afford a considerable supply to remoter countries. But the childhood of the little Greeks and Romans must have been absolutely unlighted by a single ray of joy from chocolate creams or Everton toffee.|$|E
