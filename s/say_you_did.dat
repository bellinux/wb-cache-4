500|$|As {{the smoke}} cleared, the Prussian {{infantry}} reformed its lines, preparing {{to pursue the}} fleeing Austrians. Snow began to fall and Frederick halted the pursuit. A few soldiers, perhaps only one, started to sing the well-known chorale, Nun danket alle Gott (Now Thank We All Our God); eventually the entire army may have joined in the song, although this story is likely apocryphal. Frederick pushed toward Lissa. Refugees from the battle had filled the town, and he found {{the courtyard of the}} local castle crowded with startled Austrian officers. Reportedly, after he dismounted, he addressed them politely, [...] "Good evening, Gentlemen, I dare <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not expect me here. [...] Can one get a night's lodging along with you?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The role of cantankerous skipper Charlie Allnutt won Bogart {{his only}} Academy Award in three nominations, for Best Actor in a Leading Role in 1951. Bogart {{considered}} his performance {{to be the}} best of his film career. [...] He had vowed to friends that if he won, his speech would break the convention of thanking everyone in sight. He advised Claire Trevor, when she had been nominated for Key Largo, to [...] "just <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> it all yourself and don't thank anyone". But when Bogart won the Academy Award, which he truly coveted despite his well-advertised disdain for Hollywood, he said [...] "It's {{a long way from the}} Belgian Congo to the stage of this theatre. It's nicer to be here. Thank you very much... No one does it alone. As in tennis, you need a good opponent or partner to bring out the best in you. John and Katie helped me to be where I am now". Despite the thrilling win and the recognition, Bogart later commented, [...] "The way to survive an Oscar is never to try to win another one... too many stars... win it and then figure they have to top themselves... they become afraid to take chances. The result: A lot of dull performances in dull pictures".|$|E

6000|$|... "What!" [...] {{cried the}} old woman. She came up near, and peering at her daughter, {{repeated}} three times: [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say?</b> What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say?</b> What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> say?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not know}} where the trail may lead <b>you,</b> and <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not seem to care. One would fancy that was wrong," [...] she said.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You know, you know. Oh, husband, my Lord, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not believe}} it. <b>Say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not believe it. Send the {{whispering}} fiend away. He has hidden my sisters.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} could, Francis, but I {{do not see}} any escape for it, {{especially}} as you <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not recognize Ruggiero as the passenger you carried." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{not going}} to give my cousin up to please Lady Albury--no, nor all the Fotheringhams put together! You used to <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not care for gossip.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I didn't <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> Bob. But what I {{want you}} to do is to tell me {{everything}} that you know. Was there anybody in this office during my absence?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Certainly, I know no {{more than}} you and others know--it was a {{gratuitous}} unpleasantness in you to <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not doubt me. Why should you, or anybody, have doubted me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No reprieve, no reprieve! Nobody comes near us. There's {{only the}} night left now!' moaned Dennis faintly, as he wrung his hands. 'Do you think they'll reprieve {{me in the}} night, brother? I've known reprieves come in the night, afore now. I've known 'em come as late as five, six, and seven o'clock in the morning. Don't you think there's a good chance yet,--don't <b>you?</b> <b>Say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> young man,' whined the miserable creature, with an imploring gesture towards Barnaby, 'or I shall go mad!' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I dare <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> That is evident. You {{relish the}} work which lies before you still {{better than you}} would relish the {{execution}} of a government order for army-cloth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I can't <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> appear {{very anxious}} about it. I'll just swallow one dandy of punch, and then I'll get home. I'm later now than I meant to be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I must <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>DO</b> stare!" [...] exclaimed the newcomer, who was {{clothed in}} soft {{floating}} robes of rose and pearl color, and whose eyes shone upon them like two stars.|$|R
6000|$|... "I could. But {{he should}} not drive me from him, as you <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> her; never--never--never. He might kill me if he would; but if I once {{had told him that}} I loved him, I would never leave him afterwards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{was it you}} said, then? I <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> You {{proposed}} to me,--to me a priest of God's altar,--a false counterfeit marriage, so that those two poor women, who you are afraid to face, might be cajoled and chaited and ruined." ...|$|E

60|$|THE SERPENT. Life {{must not}} cease. That comes before everything. It is silly to <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not care. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> care. It is that care that will prompt your imagination; inflame your desires; make your will irresistible; and create out of nothing.|$|R
