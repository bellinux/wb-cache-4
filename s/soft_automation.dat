40|$|SUMMARY: Construction is {{following}} the general industry trend towards the introduction of hard and <b>soft</b> <b>automation</b> for many aspects of materials identification and tracking. Recent developments in RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) tagging provide the hardware solution and cyber-agents {{are part of the}} software scheme employed. The agents – programs that can make autonomous decisions and take necessary action when required – are totally dependent upon sensors (rather than human intervention) to provide real-time information on parameters such as location, condition and timing: RFID tags are seen as an appropriate sensor type for providing this kind of information. The potential of RFID tagging technology in the construction and management of facilities is assessed in terms of value chains, a number of applications for improving efficiency are reviewed, and others are proposed. Although there is little evidence presently of RFID adoption in the wider construction sector, the paper concludes that a breakthrough will result from applications that emphasise the management of the building or facility, in particular energy consumption...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Whether {{we like it}} or not, {{automation}} {{is gradually}} taking over the driver’s role. Full vehicle automation is predicted to be on British roads by 2030 (Walker et al., 2001). However, experience in aviation gives us some cause for concern for the ‘drive-by-wire ’ car (Stanton & Marsden, 1996). Problems of workload and situation awareness have been attributed as the root cause of some aircraft accidents (Beaty, 1995). These problems may be approached in two different ways, depending on the level of automation used. These two philosophies are exemplified by the positions of the two major aircraft manufacturers. Airbus use a ‘hard protection ’ system in their A 320 and A 340 series, employing automation to prevent error, and hence it can override the pilot. Boeing, on the other hand, opted for ‘soft protection ’ in their 777 aircraft, using automation as a tool to aid pilots, and not giving it the authority to override pilot control (Hughes & Dornheim, 1995). This paper speculates whether hard or <b>soft</b> <b>automation</b> provides the best solution for road vehicles, and considers an alternative design philosophy in vehicles of the future based on coordination and cooperation...|$|E
40|$|Compared to {{widespread}} successful deployment of robotic manipulators for repetitive and hazardous tasks in related {{industries such as}} manufacturing, the construction industry has achieved relatively limited benefits from robotics and <b>soft</b> <b>automation.</b> Unlike manufacturing, where robotic solutions benefit from the structured layout of the environment (e. g., factory assembly line), construction robots face unique challenges that arise from the rugged, dynamic, and unstructured environment of the work site, {{as well as the}} uncertainty and evolving sequence of occurring on-site events. This challenges any intended construction robots to not only replicate basic human motion, but also be capable of sensing and adapting to environmental changes, and making decisions based on the evolving state of the environment. Building upon recent advancements in robotic mapping, computer vision, and object recognition, the authors propose to introduce autonomous behavior at the basic task level for on-site construction robots to address these challenges in a flexible and extensible manner. This paper reports the outcome of the first phase of this research- a structured methodology for improved design and development of basic task automations- and focuses on algorithms developed for mobile robot navigation and relative pose estimation. The algorithms are implemented on a prototype mobile robotic platform, and evaluated in several experimental scenarios...|$|E
40|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>automation</b> employs multi-functional robotic {{manipulators}} where dexterity, versatility and reconfigurability are {{now becoming}} key issues. For manipulators {{used in these}} circumstances, hyper-redundancy in configuration is essential. A typical application envisaged, is manipulator movement in unpredictable surroundings such as navigation amongst branches and foliage in automated fruit picking. This requires motion of a manipulator in an unmapped dynamic environment to find {{its way to the}} goal i. e. the fruit. To date, centralized control architectures have proven impractical for the control of redundant systems because the full environment needs to be mapped, there are time constraints on the computation required and, simultaneously, algorithms for obstacle avoidance must be enacted. Decentralized control of manipulators complements modular construction because the need for a full environment reconstruction in one master controller is bypassed by having localized sub-goals for each module. Time constraints are removed because the control algorithms are much simpler. Obstacle avoidance is localized. Manipulators constructed modularly are effective because they allow for reconfiguration and ease of fault diagnosis. For modular manipulators to be a more effective option as a subclass of robots, the conditions under which the interactive movements of modules are stable become a major issue. When a general review of hyper-redundant manipulators was undertaken, no published implementation of Modular Decentralized Control (MDC) was discovered. This thesis explored the use of a modular decentralized technique to create stable control of a redundant manipulator system. The computational burden was minimized by restricting inverse kinematics to within each module. Advantages of the approach taken were the ease of implementation of obstacle avoidance, reconfigurability and fault tolerance. Having firstly simulated a MATLAB version of stable motion using MDC on a modular manipulator with up to six identical modules, the technique was extended with state space analysis to redefine the limits of stable control of a hyper-redundant manipulator. The MDC study mapped motion profile types that were dependant on the initial manipulator configuration and goal position and, thereby, investigated possible instabilities in the system. A two-link, single degree of freedom system was initially explicated followed by an extension of the stability analysis to an n-module two degree of freedom system. A stability theory utilizing decentralized control was formed. Simulation results showed dynamic motion, path generation and obstacle avoidance capabilities in unmapped environments to be stable. The modeling redefined the bounds of stable control, showing that classical stability via Root Locus, now required only two roots from the characteristic equation to be stable for a selection of path trajectory to the goal to be found. The remaining roots could be unstable in traversing to the goal and settling at a marginal stability point when the goal was reached. The marginal stability was a reflection of the pseudo-independence given to each module in seeking the goal and differed radically from a standard Root Locus analysis and interpretation of stability. A hyper-redundant Reconfigurable Modular Manipulator System (RMMS) was designed and built to implement the MDC technique in a real world environment. From an initial design, five modules were constructed and control algorithms embedded appropriate to their position in a five-segment robotic manipulator. A stereoscopic vision system was attached {{to the end of the}} manipulator which supplied real time data on a goal in 3 D Cartesian space. The data was supplied to the first module of the arm and subsequently to all others by localized homogenous transformation. The manipulator was tested for goal seeking, path following, obstacle avoidance, fault tolerance and reconfigurability. The arm produced stable motion and satisfied the criteria as hypothesized in the theory...|$|E
