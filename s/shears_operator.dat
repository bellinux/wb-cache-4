The improvements were based on findings from a field survey of six mines and laboratory test results. The report in-cludes information on installation and use of the improved shearer-clearer system and describes a field installation and 3 -week underground test of the system. The improved shearer clearer, like its predecessor, reduces dust concentrations in the <b>shearer</b> <b>operator's</b> walkway by splitting the airflow on the upwind side of the shearer and confining the dust cloud to the face side of the shearer. The improved shearer-clearer system utilizes more practical-mounting locations for the water sprays and requires less water consumption. In the underground test, the improved system maintained the clean-air split in the walkway up to 40 ft downstream from the shearer. To further improve dust suppression, cooling-water manifolds were relocated into the loading zone. The laboratory and underground tests showed that the improved shearer-clearer system and the techniques described can significantly reduce the respirable dust exposure of <b>shearer</b> <b>operators</b> from shearer-generated dust...|$|R

40|$|Longwall mining {{in lower}} seam heights may necessitate {{the use of}} single-drum shearers to {{overcome}} size constraints associated with standard double-drum shearers. To avoid the operational problem of clearance in the tailgate entry with one single-drum shearer, two single-drum machines can be operated on the same face, with each shearer responsible for mining a predefined portion of the face. However, utilization of two shearers on the same face necessitates the positioning of one <b>shearer</b> <b>operator</b> and a jacksetter in the return air of the upwind shearer, thus complicating respirable dust control on the longwall. In an effort to evaluate the unique dust control problems associated {{with this type of}} mining, the U. S. Bureau of Mines conducted dust surveys on two multiple-machine longwall operations. Sampling was done to quantify major sources of respirable dust and to identify potential solutions to problem areas. Sampling results indicate that the cutting sequences utilized on multiple-machine faces may have to be designed to minimize dust exposure, as opposed to optimizing productivity or facilitating operational requirements. Also, state-of-the-art dust control techniques typically found on double-drum shearer longwalls must be employed to help minimize the exposure of all face personnel to traditional dust sources...|$|R

As longwall chocks (supports) advance, crushed roof coal and/or rock can fall {{from the top of}} the chock canopy into the face ventilation airflow. Dust survey showed that chock movement is a significant source of dust exposure for <b>shearer</b> <b>operators,</b> accounting for about 47 % of total LW face dust make during the cutting cycle. 3 D CFD models have been developed to understand the behaviour of longwall dust particles from various sources including maingate (MG) chocks and stage loader/crusher.

Dust control systems using ultra fine water-mist technology have demonstrated promising results in encapsulating respirable dust particles. A prototype water-mist based venturi system has been developed to firstly produce ultra-fine water droplets (5 - 15 μm) for suppressing the respirable dust particles from the MG chocks/BSL; and secondly induce a water-mist airflow with sufficient momentum to divert dust clouds off the walkway area along the face.

As a result of this production increase, control of respirable dust continues to be a problem. Therefore, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), Pittsburgh Health Technology Center, Dust Division, initiated a study to investigate the availability and adequacy of technology for controlling dust on longwal / mining operations. The study involved 23 longwall mining operations in three dijferentCoalMineSafetyandHealthDistricts. Each operation was visited for a full shift. Respirable dust samples were collected on face personnel and atfu:ed locations along the face. Methods being used to control dust were noted, with special emphasis placed on obtaining quantitative data relative to ventilation, head gate dust controls, cutting drum sprays, external machine sprays and cutting sequence.

40|$|Noise-induced {{hearing loss}} {{is the second}} most {{pervasive}} disease in the mining industry. The exposure of miners to noise levels above the permissible exposure level results in hearing loss of approximately 80 % of coal miners by retirement age. In addition, between 2002 and 2011, approximately 48 % of longwall <b>shearer</b> <b>operators</b> were overexposed in coal mines in the United States. Previous research identified the two rotating cutting drums used by the longwall shearer to extract coal as the most significant sound-radiating components. In this context, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health conducted research to develop noise controls for longwall mining systems. To this end, structural and acoustic numerical models of a single cutting drum were developed to assess its dynamic and acoustic response, respectively. Once validated, these models were used to explore various noise control concepts including force isolation, varying structural damping and varying component stiffness. Upon multiple simulations, it was determined that structural modifications to increase the stiffness of the outer vane plates were the most practical and durable approach to reduce the sound radiated by the cutting drums. Furthermore, these modifications did not adversely affect the cutting performance, nor the loading ability of the drums. As a result, these structural modifications were implemented into an actual set of drums for evaluation purposes. Results from the underground evaluation, when the modified cutting drums were used under normal operation conditions, showed noise reduction across the entire frequency spectrum with an overall noise reduction of 3 dB in the sound pressure level at the operator location, confirming the validity of the developed noise controls.

40|$|We give a {{characterization}} theorem for umbilical spacelike submanifolds of arbitrary {{dimension and}} co-dimension {{immersed in a}} semi-Riemannian manifold. Letting the co-dimension arbitrary implies that the submanifold may be umbilical with respect to some subset of normal directions. This leads {{to the definition of}} umbilical space and to the study of its dimension. The trace-free part of the second fundamental form, called total shear tensor in this thesis, plays {{a central role in the}} characterization theorems. It allows us to define <b>shear</b> objects (<b>shear</b> <b>operators,</b> <b>shear</b> tensors and shear scalars) that determine the umbilical properties of the spacelike submanifold with respect to a given normal vector field. Given a group of conformal motions G acting on a semi-Riemannian manifold and an orbit S, we apply the characterization results in order to find necessary and sufficient conditions for S to have a non-empty umbilical space. We prove that if the isotropy subgroup of G is trivial, then the umbilical condition depends on the scalar products of a set of generating conformal Killing vector fields. If the isotropy subgroup of G is non-trivial, we argue that, under specific assumptions, it is possible to prove that the umbilical condition is automatically satisfied so that the umbilical space is non-trivial. The assumptions would depend on the co-dimension of S, the dimension of the isotropy subgroup and the ranks of specific matrices defined in terms of the structure constants of G. In the last part of the thesis we consider Lorentzian warped products M = M ×f Y and we analyse a particular class of spacelike submanifolds S. We find a sufficient condition that allows us to prove, on one hand, the existence of focal points along timelike or null geodesics normal to S and, on the other hand, the null geodesic incompleteness of M under additional reasonable conditions. By assuming that we can split the immersion as S → Σ → M, where Σ is either M × {q} or {q} × Y, we find that the Galloway-Senovilla condition can be written in terms of the warping function f and the Riemann tensor of either only M or Y. This means that, for instance, in order to prove singularity theorems one can restrict the study to just one of the two manifolds defining the warped product rather than considering the warped product manifold itself. We translate the condition found to some specific situations, such as positive and constant sectional curvature, Einstein and Ricci-flat spaces and to a few subcases in terms of the co-dimension of S.

40|$|A {{microscopic}} time-reversal invariant cranking model (MCRM) {{for nuclear}} collective rotation about a single axis and its coupling to intrinsic motion is derived. The MCRM is derived by transforming the stationary nuclear Schrodinger equation using a collective rotation-intrinsic product wavefunction, imposing no {{constraints on the}} wavefunction and the nucleon coordinates, and using no relative co-ordinates. The derivatives of the collective-rotation angle are {{defined in terms of}} a combination of rigid and irrotational collective flows of the nucleons. The collective wavefunction is chosen to be an eigenstate of the angular momentum, yielding a MCRM Schrodinger equation for the intrinsic wavefunction that contains a cranking Coriolis energy term that is linear in the angular momentum and <b>shear</b> <b>operators,</b> a collective centrifugal energy term, and a rotation-fluctuation energy term. In absence of the irrotational-flow component and fluctuation energy term, the MCRM equation reduces to that of the conventional cranking model (CCRM), but with a dynamic rigid-flow angular velocity and rigid-flow centrifugal-energy term. The expectation of the angular momentum operator, which is the sum of the collective rotation angular momentum and the expectation of the angular momentum in the intrinsic state, would reduce to that in the CCRM if the collective rotation angular momentum were small. However, it is shown that, even for the simple case of the anisotropic harmonic oscillator mean-field potential in, the collective rotation angular momentum is not small in the current version of the MCRM, and that this problem needs further study. It is also shown that the MCRM Schrodinger equation is reducible to the equations of the particle-plus-rotor, phenomenological and microscopic collective rotation-vibration, and two-fluid semi-classical collective models.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Reducing dust {{exposure}} of operators on longwall faces remains a challenging issue for mine managements.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} ambipolar diffusion and the Hall effect on the stability of weakly-ionized, magnetized planar shear flows. Employing a local approach similar to the shearing-sheet approximation, we solve {{for the evolution of}} linear perturbations in both streamwise-symmetric and non-streamwise-symmetric geometries using WKB techniques and/or numerical methods. We find that instability arises from the combination of shear and non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic processes, and {{is a result of the}} ability of these processes to influence the free energy path between the perturbations and the shear. They turn what would be simple linear-in-time growth due to current and vortex stretching from shear into exponentially-growing instabilities. Our results aid in understanding previous work on the behaviour of weakly-ionized accretion discs. In particular, the recent finding that the Hall effect and ambipolar diffusion destabilize both positive and negative angular velocity gradients acquires a natural explanation in the more general context of this paper. We construct a simple toy model for these instabilities based upon transformation <b>operators</b> (<b>shears,</b> rotations, and projections) that captures both their qualitative and, in certain cases, exact quantitative behaviour.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of magnetic}} eld in the stretch{fold{shear (SFS) dynamo map is considered for zero magnetic diusion.

In the paper rst a number of numerical discretisations are presented that give differing results for growth rates, and indicate {{the need to develop}} systematic theory. Then magnetic elds that are only required to be square integrable are considered, and the spectral properties of the SFS dynamo operator and its adjoint are discussed, as operators in L 2. Adjoint eigenfunctions are typically not smooth, however. To obtain smooth, growing adjoint eigenfunctions attention is restricted to a subset of magnetic elds that are analytic in a disc in the complex plane. Restricted to this subset and using a supremum norm, the SFS adjoint operator is compact and this allows a numerical treatment of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with systematic error estimates. These estimates show that for suciently large shear there are smooth growing adjoint eigenfunctions and so perfect dynamo action is established.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of lattice Boltzmann algorithms produce a non-Galilean invariant viscous stress. This defect arises from {{the absence of a}} term in the third moment, the equilibrium heat flow tensor, proportional to the cube of the fluid velocity. This moment cannot be specified independently of the lower moments on the standard lattices such as D 2 Q 9, D 3 Q 15, D 3 Q 19 or D 3 Q 27. A partial correction has recently been demonstrated that restores some of these missing cubic terms on the D 2 Q 9 and D 3 Q 27 tensor product lattices. This correction restores Galilean invariance for shear flows aligned with the coordinate axes, but flows inclined at arbitrary angles may show larger errors than before. These remaining errors are due to the diagonal terms of the equilibrium heat flow tensor, which cannot be corrected on standard lattices. However, the remaining errors may be largely absorbed by introducing a matrix collision operator with velocity-dependent collision rates for the diagonal components of the momentum flux tensor. This completely restores Galilean invariance for flows with uniform density, and in general reduces the magnitude of the defect in Galilean invariance from Mach number cubed to Mach number to the fifth power. The effectiveness of the resulting algorithm is demonstrated by comparisons with the standard and partially corrected lattice Boltzmann algorithms for two- and three-dimensional flows.
