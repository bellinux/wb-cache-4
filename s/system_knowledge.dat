40|$|A key {{component}} of research within information systems {{is the use of}} valid instruments to measure numerous aspects of technology, organizations, and people. Validated instruments exist for many different variables and more are available all the time. Knowledge of a particular domain {{is an integral part of}} working competently, effectively, and successfully within that domain (N. M. Degele, World Futures, 50, 743 – 755, 1997). Therefore, this paper will describe the rationale for the development of an instrument to measure the information <b>systems</b> <b>knowledge</b> of individuals. This rationale is rooted in several streams of research, such as absorptive capacity and certainty of knowledge, and focuses on three main questions: why measure <b>knowledge</b> of information <b>systems,</b> how to measure this knowledge, and what to actually measure. The definitions of <b>knowledge</b> and information <b>systems</b> <b>knowledge</b> are developed and refined through an analysis of the literature covering the philosophical, psychological, and educational aspects of knowledge.
