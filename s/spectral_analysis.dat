30|$|In {{this work}} two {{relatively}} new methods, the <b>spectral</b> homotopy <b>analysis</b> method and the successive linearisation method, {{have been successfully}} used to solve the von Kármán nonlinear equations for swirling flow with and without suction/injection across the disk walls and an applied magnetic field. The velocity components were compared with numerical results generated using the built-in Matlab bvp 4 c solver and against the homotopy analysis method and homotopy-Padé results in the literature. The results indicate that both the <b>spectral</b> homotopy <b>analysis</b> method and the successive linearisation method may give accurate and convergent results using only few solution terms compared with the homotopy analysis method and the Homotopy-Padé methods. Comparison has also been made with the recent findings by Turkyilmazoglu [13]. The successive linearisation method gives better accuracy at lower orders than the <b>spectral</b> homotopy <b>analysis</b> method. The tradeoff, however, is that both the <b>spectral</b> homotopy <b>analysis</b> method and the successive linearisation method may involve more computations per step compared to the methods in the literature.|$|R

5|$|Initially, {{detailed}} analysis of KBOs was impossible, and so astronomers were only able to determine the most basic facts about their makeup, primarily their color. These first data showed {{a broad range of}} colors among KBOs, ranging from neutral grey to deep red. This suggested that their surfaces were composed {{of a wide range of}} compounds, from dirty ices to hydrocarbons. This diversity was startling, as astronomers had expected KBOs to be uniformly dark, having lost most of the volatile ices from their surfaces to the effects of cosmic rays. Various solutions were suggested for this discrepancy, including resurfacing by impacts or outgassing. Jewitt and Luu's <b>spectral</b> <b>analysis</b> of the known Kuiper belt objects in 2001 found that the variation in color was too extreme to be easily explained by random impacts. The radiation from the Sun is thought to have chemically altered methane on the surface of KBOs, producing products such as tholins. Makemake has been shown to possess a number of hydrocarbons derived from the radiation-processing of methane, including ethane, ethylene and acetylene.|$|E

5|$|<b>Spectral</b> <b>analysis</b> of Makemake's surface {{revealed}} that methane must {{be present in}} the form of large grains at least one centimetre in size. In addition to methane, large amounts of ethane and tholins as well as smaller amounts of ethylene, acetylene and high-mass alkanes (like propane) may be present, most likely created by photolysis of methane by solar radiation. The tholins are probably responsible for the red color of the visible spectrum. Although evidence exists for the presence of nitrogen ice on its surface, at least mixed with other ices, there is nowhere near the same level of nitrogen as on Pluto and Triton, where it composes more than 98percent of the crust. The relative lack of nitrogen ice suggests that its supply of nitrogen has somehow been depleted over the age of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|During its {{period of}} migration, Neptune {{is thought to}} have {{captured}} a large KBO, Triton, which is the only large moon in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit (it orbits opposite to Neptune's rotation). This suggests that, unlike the large moons of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, which are thought to have coalesced from rotating discs of material around their young parent planets, Triton was a fully formed body that was captured from surrounding space. Gravitational capture of an object is not easy: it requires some mechanism to slow down the object enough to be caught by the larger object's gravity. A possible explanation is that Triton was part of a binary when it encountered Neptune. (Many KBOs are members of binaries. See below.) Ejection of the other member of the binary by Neptune could then explain Triton's capture. Triton is only 14% larger than Pluto, and <b>spectral</b> <b>analysis</b> of both worlds shows that their surfaces are largely composed of similar materials, such as methane and carbon monoxide. All this points to the conclusion that Triton was once a KBO that was captured by Neptune during its outward migration.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: An FFT-based <b>spectral</b> dynamic <b>analysis</b> {{method is}} {{developed}} for the viscously damped, linear discrete dynamic systems subjected to nonzero initial conditions. Design/methodology/approach: The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) theory is used to develop a <b>spectral</b> dynamic <b>analysis</b> method. The dynamic response of a linear system is assumed as {{the sum of the}} forced and free vibration response parts. The forced vibration response part is obtained by convolving the dynamic stiffness matrix and Fourier components of excitation force through the Duhamel’s integral, and the free vibration response part is obtained by determining its integral constants so as to satisfy initial conditions in frequency-domain. Findings: It is shown through some numeral examples that the proposed FFT-based <b>spectral</b> dynamic <b>analysis</b> method provides the solutions which accurately satisfy all initial conditions. Practical implications: This analysis method is applicable to viscously damped, linear discrete dynamic systems subjected to nonzero arbitrary initial conditions. In this study, two types of viscous damping are considered: proportional damping and non-proportional damping. Originality/value: The FFT-based <b>spectral</b> dynamic <b>analysis</b> method proposed in this paper is unique because the pseudo-force concept or the superposition of corrective free vibration solution used by other researchers is not used to take into account non-zero initial conditions...|$|R

During a 6 -month follow-up period, 7 patients (2. 7 %) died suddenly and 9 (3. 5 %) developed spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia. The mean numeric values of the standard time domain signal-averaged ECG variables in patients without arrhythmic events differed significantly from those in patients with arrhythmic events. The mean values of the spectral temporal signal-averaged ECG variables did not differ between the two patient groups. A strategy requiring positively in any two time domain signal-averaged ECG variables provided the optimal receiver operating characteristic curves for predicting arrhythmic events. With <b>spectral</b> temporal <b>analysis,</b> a strategy using the Hanning window and diagnosing a positive signal-averaged ECG when two variables were abnormal provided the optimal curve for predicting arrhythmic events. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that {{over a wide range}} of sensitivity, time domain variables had higher specificity for predicting arrhythmic events than did spectral temporal variables. Time domain analysis also provided significantly fewer false positive results than did <b>spectral</b> temporal <b>analysis</b> up to sensitivity values of 70 %.

The Fourier transform of such a function does not exist in the usual sense, and it has been found more useful for the analysis of signals to instead take the Fourier transform of its autocorrelation function.|$|E
