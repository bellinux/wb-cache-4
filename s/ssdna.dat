5|$|The {{most common}} {{cellular}} signals activating the SOS response are regions of single-stranded DNA (<b>ssDNA),</b> arising from stalled replication forks or double-strand breaks, which are processed by DNA helicase {{to separate the}} two DNA strands. In the initiation step, RecA protein binds to <b>ssDNA</b> in an ATP hydrolysis driven reaction creating RecA–ssDNA filaments. RecA–ssDNA filaments activate LexA autoprotease activity, which ultimately leads to cleavage of LexA dimer and subsequent LexA degradation. The loss of LexA repressor induces transcription of the SOS genes and allows for further signal induction, inhibition of cell division {{and an increase in}} levels of proteins responsible for damage processing.|$|E
5|$|For most viruses with RNA genomes {{and some}} with {{single-stranded}} DNA genomes, the single strands {{are said to}} be either positive-sense (called the plus-strand) or negative-sense (called the minus-strand), depending on if they are complementary to the viral messenger RNA (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic <b>ssDNA</b> is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that the template strand for the viral mRNA is complementary to it (−), and the coding strand is a copy of it (+). However, several types of <b>ssDNA</b> and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are ambisense in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate. Examples include geminiviruses, which are <b>ssDNA</b> plant viruses and arenaviruses, which are ssRNA viruses of animals.|$|E
5|$|Genome size varies greatly between species. The {{smallest}} viral genomes– the <b>ssDNA</b> circoviruses, family Circoviridae– {{code for}} only two proteins and have a genome size of only two kilobases; the largest–the pandoraviruses–have genome sizes of around two megabases which code for about 2500 proteins. Virus genes rarely have introns and often are arranged in the genome so that they overlap.|$|E
5|$|The BRCA OB3 domain assumes an OB fold, which {{consists}} of a highly curved five-stranded beta-sheet that closes on itself to form a beta-barrel. OB3 has a pronounced groove formed by one face of the curved sheet and is demarcated by two loops, one between beta 1 and beta 2 and another between beta 4 and beta 5, which allows for strong <b>ssDNA</b> binding.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, most DNA {{molecules}} {{are actually}} two polymer strands, bound {{together in a}} helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded (dsDNA) structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart– {{a process known as}} melting– to form two single-stranded DNA (<b>ssDNA)</b> molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).|$|E
5|$|Archaea can be {{infected}} by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated {{to any other}} form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported <b>ssDNA</b> genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses.|$|E
5|$|Helical: These viruses are {{composed}} of a single type of capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube. This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions: These can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material, in general, single-stranded RNA, but <b>ssDNA</b> in some cases, is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, {{the length of a}} helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus {{is an example of a}} helical virus.|$|E
25|$|Crithidia luciliae is a haemoflagellate protist with an {{organelle}} {{known as}} the kinetoplast. This organelle contains {{a high concentration of}} circular DNA with no recognisable nuclear antigens, allowing for the reliable detection of anti-dsDNA antibodies. The kinetoplast fluoresces if serum contains high avidity anti-dsDNA antibodies. This test has a higher specificity than EIA because it uses unprocessed DNA. Processed DNA can contain regions of <b>ssDNA,</b> allowing detection of anti-ssDNA antibodies, which can give false positive results.|$|E
25|$|The AAV genome {{is built}} of {{single-stranded}} deoxyribonucleic acid (<b>ssDNA),</b> either positive- or negative-sensed, {{which is about}} 4.7 kilobase long. The genome comprises inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) {{at both ends of}} the DNA strand, and two open reading frames (ORFs): rep and cap. The former is composed of four overlapping genes encoding Rep proteins required for the AAV life cycle, and the latter contains overlapping nucleotide sequences of capsid proteins: VP1, VP2 and VP3, which interact together to form a capsid of an icosahedral symmetry.|$|E
25|$|EIA (enzyme immunoassay) detects {{antibodies}} using a DNA-coated polystyrene microtitre plate. The DNA used {{in these}} assays is often recombinant dsDNA or from calf thymus extract. Upon incubation with serum containing anti-dsDNA antibodies, the antibodies will bind to the DNA and can then be visualised using enzyme-linked secondary antibodies. This assay can be quantitative or semi-quantitative, allowing for estimations of the levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies. This test can produce false positives due to contamination of <b>ssDNA</b> from denatured dsDNA. EIA detects low and high avidity anti-dsDNA antibodies, increasing its sensitivity and reducing its specificity.|$|E
25|$|Nucleic acid {{thermodynamics}} is {{the study}} of how temperature affects the nucleic acid structure of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The melting temperature (Tm) is defined as the temperature at which half of the DNA strands are in the random coil or single-stranded (<b>ssDNA)</b> state. Tm depends on the length of the DNA molecule and its specific nucleotide sequence. DNA, when in a state where its two strands are dissociated (i.e., the dsDNA molecule exists as two independent strands), is referred to as having been denatured by the high temperature.|$|E
25|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, linear chromosomes face {{another issue}} that is not seen in circular DNA replication. Due {{to the fact that}} an RNA primer is required for initiation of DNA synthesis, the lagging strand is at a disadvantage in replicating the entire chromosome. While the leading strand can use a single RNA primer to extend the 5' terminus of the replicating DNA strand, multiple RNA primers are responsible for lagging strand synthesis, creating Okazaki fragments. This leads to an issue {{due to the fact that}} DNA polymerase is only able to add to the 3' end of the DNA strand. The 3'-5' action of DNA polymerase along the parent strand leaves a short single-stranded DNA (<b>ssDNA)</b> region at the 3' end of the parent strand when the Okazaki fragments have been repaired. Since replication occurs in opposite directions at opposite ends of parent chromosomes, each strand is a lagging strand at one end. Over time this would result in progressive shortening of both daughter chromosomes. This is known as the end replication problem.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of the}} {{transformation}} process, the RecA protein interacts with entering single-stranded DNA (<b>ssDNA)</b> to form RecA/ssDNA nucleofilaments that scan the resident chromosome for regions of homology and bring the entering <b>ssDNA</b> to the corresponding region, where strand exchange and homologous recombination occur. [...] Thus the process of homologous recombination during bacterial transformation has fundamental similarities to homologous recombination during meiosis.|$|E
500|$|DMC1 (DNA meiotic {{recombinase}} 1) is a meiosis specific homolog of RAD51 that mediates strand exchange during homologous recombinational repair. [...] DMC1 {{promotes the}} formation of DNA strand invasion products (joint molecules) between homologous DNA molecules. [...] Human DMC1 interacts directly with each {{of a series of}} repeat sequences in the BRCA2 protein (called BRC repeats) that stimulate joint molecule formation by DMC1. [...] BRC repeats conform to a motif consisting of a sequence of about 35 highly conserved amino acids that are present at least once in all BRCA2-like proteins. [...] The BRCA2 BRC repeats stimulate joint molecule formation by promoting the interaction of single-stranded DNA (<b>ssDNA)</b> with DMC1. [...] The <b>ssDNA</b> complexed with DMC1 can pair with homologous <b>ssDNA</b> from another chromosome during the synapsis stage of meiosis to form a joint molecule, a central step in homologous recombination. Thus the BRC repeat sequences of BRCA2 appear to {{play a key role in}} recombinational repair of DNA damages during meiotic recombination.|$|E
500|$|In eukaryotes, BRCA2 protein has an {{important}} role in homologous recombinational repair. In mice and humans, BRCA2 primarily mediates orderly assembly of RAD51 on single-stranded (ss) DNA, the form that is active for homologous pairing and strand invasion. BRCA2 also redirects RAD51 from double-stranded DNA and prevents dissociation from <b>ssDNA.</b> [...] In addition, the four paralogs of RAD51, consisting of RAD51B (RAD51L1), RAD51C (RAD51L2), RAD51D (RAD51L3), XRCC2 form a complex called the BCDX2 complex (see Figure: Recombinational repair of DNA). This complex participates in RAD51 recruitment or stabilization at damage sites. [...] The BCDX2 complex appears to act by facilitating the assembly or stability of the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament. [...] RAD51 catalyses strand transfer between a broken sequence and its undamaged homologue to allow re-synthesis of the damaged region (see homologous recombination models).|$|E
500|$|Transformation (the {{transfer}} of DNA from one bacterial cell to another through the intervening medium) {{appears to be}} part of an adaptation for DNA repair. [...] H. pylori is naturally competent for transformation. [...] While many organisms are competent only under certain environmental conditions, such as starvation, H. pylori is competent throughout logarithmic growth. [...] All organisms encode genetic programs for response to stressful conditions including those that cause DNA damage. In H. pylori, homologous recombination is required for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The AddAB helicase-nuclease complex resects DSBs and loads RecA onto single-strand DNA (<b>ssDNA),</b> which then mediates strand exchange, leading to homologous recombination and repair. The requirement of RecA plus AddAB for efficient gastric colonization suggests, in the stomach, H. pylori is either exposed to double-strand DNA damage that must be repaired or requires some other recombination-mediated event. [...] In particular, natural transformation is increased by DNA damage in H. pylori, and a connection exists between the DNA damage response and DNA uptake in H. pylori, suggesting natural competence contributes to persistence of H. pylori in its human host and explains the retention of competence in most clinical isolates.|$|E

2500|$|The no-SCAR {{method is}} more {{efficient}} than standard cloning techniques including <b>ssDNA</b> recombineering [...] {{as well as other}} scar-free genome editing techniques. The method allows for unlimited numbers of single step genomic alterations without the use of selectable markers. The great advantage of the method, specifically in terms research applications, is the speed of the protocol. In the seminal paper by Reisch and Prather, the no-SCAR method required 5 days of work including the cloning step necessary for sgRNA targeting. Once the cells contain the pCas9cr4 plasmid, subsequent experiments can be completed in as little as 3 days allowing for rapid genome editing. Currently, the no-SCAR method is faster than any other method published [...] and is an attractive option for researchers interested in studying the effects of numerous modifications.|$|E
2500|$|... 75% {{of plant}} viruses have genomes that consist of single {{stranded}} RNA (ssRNA). 65% of plant viruses have +ssRNA, {{meaning that they}} are in the same sense orientation as messenger RNA but 10% have -ssRNA, meaning they must be converted to +ssRNA before they can be translated. 5% are double stranded RNA and so can be immediately translated as +ssRNA viruses. 3% require a reverse transcriptase enzyme to convert between RNA and DNA. 17% of plant viruses are <b>ssDNA</b> and very few are dsDNA, in contrast a quarter of animal viruses are dsDNA and three quarters of bacteriophage are dsDNA. Viruses use the plant ribosomes to produce the 4-10 proteins encoded by their genome. However, since many of the proteins are encoded on a single strand (that is, they are polycistronic) this will mean that the ribosome will either only produce one protein, as it will terminate translation at the first stop codon, or that a polyprotein will be produced. Plant viruses have had to evolve special techniques to allow the production of viral proteins by plant cells.|$|E

50|$|Chk1 is {{regulated}} by ATR through phosphorylation, forming the ATR-Chk1 pathway. This pathway recognizes single strand DNA (<b>ssDNA)</b> {{which can be}} a result of UV-induced damage, replication stress and inter-strand cross linking. Often <b>ssDNA</b> can be a result of abnormal replication during S phase through the uncoupling of replication enzymes helicase and DNA polymerase. These <b>ssDNA</b> structures attract ATR and eventually activates the checkpoint pathway.|$|E

BRCA2 also redirects RAD51 from dsDNA and prevents dissociation from <b>ssDNA.</b> [...] However, {{in the presence of}} a BRCA2 mutation, human RAD52 can mediate RAD51 assembly on <b>ssDNA</b> and substitute for BRCA2 in homologous recombinational DNA repair, though with lower efficiency than BRCA2.|$|E
5000|$|After {{digestion}} of the RNA, {{a single}} stranded DNA (<b>ssDNA)</b> is left and because single stranded nucleic acids are hydrophobic, {{it tends to}} loop around itself. It {{is likely that the}} <b>ssDNA</b> forms a hairpin loop at the 3' end.|$|E
50|$|Single-stranded DNA (<b>ssDNA)</b> folds into a {{tertiary}} structure. The conformation is sequence {{dependent and}} most single base pair mutations will alter {{the shape of}} the structure. When applied to a gel, the tertiary shape will determine the mobility of the <b>ssDNA,</b> providing a mechanism to differentiate between SNP alleles. This method first involves PCR amplification of the target DNA. The double-stranded PCR products are denatured using heat and formaldehyde to produce <b>ssDNA.</b> The <b>ssDNA</b> is applied to a non-denaturing electrophoresis gel and allowed to fold into a tertiary structure. Differences in DNA sequence will alter the tertiary conformation and be detected as a difference in the <b>ssDNA</b> strand mobility (Costabile et al. 2006). This method is widely used because it is technically simple, relatively inexpensive and uses commonly available equipment. However compared to other SNP genotyping methods, the sensitivity of this assay is lower. It has been found that the <b>ssDNA</b> conformation is highly dependent on temperature and it is not generally apparent what the ideal temperature is. Very often the assay will be carried out using several different temperatures. There is also a restriction on the length of fragment because the sensitivity drops when sequences longer than 400 bp are used (Costabile et al. 2006).|$|E
50|$|An aligned carbon {{nanotube}} ultrasensitive biosensor for DNA detection was developed. The design and fabrication of the biosensor {{was based on}} aligned single wall {{carbon nanotube}}s (SWCNTs) with integrated single-strand DNAs (<b>ssDNA).</b> The fabricated ultra-sensitive biosensor provided label-free real-time electronic detection of DNA hybridization between surface immobilized <b>ssDNA</b> and target <b>ssDNA.</b> Hybridization kinetics between complementary and target <b>ssDNA</b> nucleotide base pairs resulted in a local charge generation between base pairs that was injected into the SWCNTs resulting in a detectable change in SWCNT electrical conductance. This conductance change was amplified electrically through {{the integration of the}} functionalized SWCNTs as the semi-conductive channel in a silicon-silicon oxide based field effect transistor (FET). Based on previous Langmuir DNA kinetics calculations, the projected sensitivity level of the SWCNT-DNA sensor was considerably higher than traditional fluorescent and hybridization assays.|$|E

5000|$|Crampton et al. have {{proposed}} a mechanism for the ssDNA-dependent hydrolysis of dTTP by T7 DNA helicase {{as shown in the}} figure below. [...] In their model, protein loops located on each hexameric subunit, each of which contain three lysine residues, sequentially interact with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of <b>ssDNA.</b> This interaction presumably causes a conformational change in the actively bound subunit, providing for the efficient release of dTDP from its dTTP binding site. In the process of dTDP release, the <b>ssDNA</b> is transferred to the neighboring subunit, which undergoes a similar process. Previous studies have already suggested that <b>ssDNA</b> is able to bind to two hexameric subunits simultaneously.|$|E
