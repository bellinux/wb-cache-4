40|$|Landfill gas is {{produced}} through bacterial decomposition, volatilization and chemical reactions. Most landfill gas {{is produced}} by bacterial decomposition that occurs when organic waste solids, food (i. e. meats, vegetables), garden waste (i. e. leaf and yardwaste), wood and paper products, are broken down by bacteria naturally present in the waste and in soils. Volatilization generates landfill gas when certain wastes change from a liquid or solid into a vapor. Chemical reactions occur when different waste materials are mixed together during disposal operations. Additionally, moisture plays a large roll in the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>decomposition.</b> Generally, the more moisture, the more landfill gas is generated, both during the aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Landfill Gas Production and Composition: In general, during anaerobic conditions, the composition of landfill gas is approximately 50 percent methane and 50 percent carbon dioxide with trace amounts (< 1 percent) of nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen, and nonmethane organic compounds (NMOCs).

WEP for goat manure, however, which was similar to that of hen, did not differ (p <  0.1) from cattle and swine. Regarding the accumulated leached P (Fig.  2), the treatment with goat manure was between the treatment with hen manure, which was smaller, and swine and cattle manure, which were higher (Table  6). This trend of WEP for goat manure, consistent in leached P and the remaining WEP in the soil, suggests an increase in solubility of P from this source {{during the course of the}} experiment. The nature and mineralization of manure are very heterogeneous and are dependent on the species of the animal, its age, diet, and the physical and chemical conditions of the soil.

The increase of OPR tensile strength had advantages because the materials did not easily break up.

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{materials}} and substances show decomposition reactions during handling, production and transport. The amount of heat and pressure generated during this decomposition will determine if a substance can be considered thermally stable in a specific packaging size and temperature. Often the so called Self Accelerating Decomposition Temperature (SADT) is calculated for materials showing decomposition. This temperature {{is defined as the}} temperature at which the amount of heat produced by the decomposition reaction is equal to the heat loss of its packaging. For materials decomposing according to a pseudo zero order reaction (Arrhenius like reactions) this ethod can be considered correct. For materials showing autocatalytic decompositions the amount of heat generated is dependent on product lifetime and the conditions it was exposed to, which we will call history. This is {{in sharp contrast to the}} constant heat production that is shown in case of a pseudo zero order reaction. In order to calculate a conservative value for the SADT of autocatalytic decomposing materials the heat generated at the maximum speed of the reaction should be used. The <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>decomposition</b> varies a lot among different autocatalytic decomposing materials the under storage conditions. The time it takes to reach critical levels of heat production can vary between hours to years depending on the type of material. For these type of materials it is not relevant to determine the temperature at which self-heating occurs, but the time it takes to reach a critical level of heat production at a certain temperature and package size. This paper will first discuss the flaws of the different methods to determine the SADT in case of autocatalytic decomposing materials. Secondly a method is proposed to determine the life time expectancy of autocatalytic decomposing materials, taken into account for the history of the material...|$|E
40|$|A {{theory of}} enzyme {{catalysis}} is described which utilizes a thermodynamically consistent {{construction of a}} free energy diagram with different pathways for complex formation and decomposition. The switch to the decomposition pathway occurs when downward uncertainty and thermal fluctuations make possible a short-lived potential energy dominance in which parallel spin electrons are paired and thus free to drop below the energy floor normally maintained by the Pauli exclusion principle. Such pairing is possible if van der Waal's and other weak interactions holding the complex together impose confinement constraints on parallel spin electrons, thereby both increasing uncertainty fluctuations in their kinetic energy and weakly favoring a phase correlation in their motion (which can be interpreted {{in terms of an}} exchange of virtual particles). The paired configuration is highly unstable and thus energy released by pair falling is either immediately recaptured to re-establish a normal orbital structure or, if the pair persists long enough to produce a nuclear motion, recaptured {{at the end of this}} motion. In the latter case the release of energy can be thought of as an energy loan which finances the switch to the lower activation energy pathway without compromising an energy-balanced regeneration of the enzyme. The advantage is that the complex (because of its instability) has a real free energy which is lower than the free energy which would be assigned to it on the basis of its equilibrium concentration. This increases the specificity and speed of complex formation without decreasing the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>decomposition.</b> The theory predicts that the magnetic moment which marks the pair should accompany the nuclear (e. g. allosteric) motion and that the pair formation stage of the enzymatic process should have an anomalous temperature dependence. Variations of the model may be constructed to deal with a number of processes involving macromolecular motions, including sequential processes in catalysis, allosteric control, persistent molecular motions, self-assembly, energy transfer, channeled transport, and protection against inhibitors...|$|E

However, the rewards of hooking and bringing on board a highly prized fish such as tuna, amberjack, mahi mahi, marlin, and others are greatly increased by the superior eating quality of the meat. Proper onboard handling practices are important for maintaining the good eating quality critical to producing excellent, “just-caught ” flavor. Decomposition or spoilage of fish is caused by breakdown of the flesh by naturally occurring enzymes or bacteria. The rate or <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>decomposition</b> is increased by high temperatures, similar to those encountered during prolonged struggle in warm Gulf waters. Controlling and maintaining good quality of the fish requires proper chilling. Taking enough ice to chill and store the catch is a MUST to prolong good quality. No matter how you handle the fish, you must properly chill and store the fish to control decomposition and quality loss. Two pounds of ice for each pound of fish is recommended for icing and storage. Line the bottom of the cooler with a layer of ice, and then surround the entire fish with more ice. Additional recommended handling practices accomplished before iced storage can delay the loss of freshness and quality and produce meat of high, “sushi”, quality. Landing – Bring the fish on board as quickly as possible. Gaff the fish in the head, or the tail region if necessary. Stunning – Stun the fish immediately after it comes on board to eliminate bruising. It is best to club the fish with a metal bar or wooden bat while the fish is still on the gaff.

O experimento foi conduzido no perÃodo 2003 / 2004, na fazenda experimental do IAPAR (Instituto AgronÃmico do ParanÃ), em um solo classificado como Latossolo Vermelho EutrofÃrrico, no municÃpio de Palotina - PR. Os tratamentos foram constituÃdos de cinco espÃcies de cobertura vegetal (milheto, guandÃ, capim moha, associaÃÃo de guandÃ com milheto e pousio) em combinaÃÃes com e sem calagem em superfÃcie. Foram aplicadas 3, 2 t ha- 1 de calcÃrio dolomÃtico em superfÃcie nas parcelas prÃ-determinadas, sem incorporaÃÃo.

The experiment was lead in period 2003 / 2004, in the experimental farm of the IAPAR (ParanÃ State Agronomic Institute), in one soil classified as Eutroferric Red Latosol, in the city of Palotina - PR. The treatments had been constituted of five vegetal covering species (millet, guandu, foxtail millet, association of guandu with millet and pousio), in combinations with and without surface liming. 3, 2 t ha- 1 of dolomitic limestone had been applied in surface in certain plots, without incorporation. It was determined that the desiccation of green fertilizers would be carried through when the species emitted string beans or panicle. At the moment of the desiccation of the plots the collections of biomass for determination of the production and the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>decomposition</b> of each one of the species had been initiated, happening again themselves this sampling 15, 30 and 45 days after. Also stratified soil samples had been collected (0 â 0, 10 and 0, 10 â 0, 20 m) in each plot, in the line of sowing of the species, for determination of pH, levels of P, M. O., H + Al, K, Ca and Mg and values of SB, CTC, V% and m%. The sowed maize were the simple modified hybrid AG- 9010. The experiment in the field was conducted until being carried through the harvest of the plots and determined the productivity. Also the determination of the components of the production (number of grains for spike, mass of the grains for spike and mass of 100 grains) in function of the vegetal species and application or not of limestone in each plot was carried through. One concluded that, independently of the species of covering, the surface liming is efficient in the correction of the acidity of the soil and increase of pH and levels of calcium and magnesium in the 0 â 0, 10 m layer. At guandu plots occurred increase of the level of phosphorus of the soil in the depth of 0, 10 â 0, 20 m, however this fact must be associated to the liming, a time that this species presents great capacity to acidify of the soil. The Millet presented greater production of dry matter and bigger tax of decomposition, followed for the association of millet with guandu and guandu. Grass mills also presented minor residue production and lesser tax of decomposition during the period of 45 days. The combination of liming more guandu as species of soil covering before the winter maize crop, results in profits in the mass of the spike and mass of 100 grains, with positive consequences in the productivit...|$|E

Integrated disease management {{is essential to}} take advantage of cultivars with partial resistance to this disease. The most effective practices, established by decades of research, use a combination of disease-free seed, destruction or avoidance of inoculum sources, manipulation of sowing dates, seed and foliar fungicides, and cultivars with improved resistance. An understanding of the pathosystems and the inter-relationship between host, pathogen and the environment is essential {{to be able to make}} correct decisions for disease control without compromising the agronomic or economic ideal. For individual pathosystems, some components of the integrated management principles may need to be given greater consideration than others. For instance, destruction of infested residue may be incompatible with no or minimum tillage practices, or rotation intervals may need to be extended in environments that slow the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> residue <b>decomposition.</b> For ascochyta-susceptible chickpeas the use of disease-free seed, or seed treatments, is crucial as seed-borne infection is highly effective as primary inoculum and epidemics develop rapidly from foci in favourable conditions.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{nucleation}} behavior <b>of</b> the liquid-liquid <b>decomposition</b> process in monotectic alloys. Aluminum-lead and aluminum-bismuth (9 wt. -%) alloys are examined to answer the question, if the decomposition can be triggered by a heterogeneous process. The experimental analysis of nucleation processes in general is a difficult task. When both phases are in the liquid state the mobility of the precipitates, sedimentation and convection and the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the <b>decomposition</b> increase the problem. Here the analysis is done by comparing the micro-structures on rapidly solidified samples to circumvent these problems. Al-Ti-B grain refiners, Al-Ti master alloys and titanium diboride and zirconium dioxide powder {{are added to the}} alloys, where the particles are supposed to stimulate the nucleation. The wetting angles of the precipitates against the ceramic particles — below 20 degree for TiB 2 and below 30 degree for ZrO 2 — suggest a good inoculation potential. Micro-structural analysis of the samples is done by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray nano tomography. Tomography assists the evaluation of the resulting structures. Applicability of three dimensional analysis is to be evaluated {{during the course of this}} work. One of the results is that the usage of titanium diboride and small amounts of Al-Ti-B grain refiners (below < 1 wt. -%) leads to an increase of the particle number density, and simultaneously to a decrease in the mean diameter of the precipitates. As pure TiB 2 itself has little effect on the matrix, the observed behavior can be attributed entirely to inoculation <b>of</b> the liquid-liquid <b>decomposition.</b> Pure titanium added as a master alloy or in larger amounts of Al-Ti-B grain refiners has the opposite effect. The included Al 3 Ti particles lead to a coarsening effect on the precipitated particles. Possible explanations for this behavior are an interaction of the grain refinement of the matrix and the particles or a chemical reaction which counteracts the intrinsic nucleation. Zirconium dioxide shows a negligible effect on the micro-structure. A low wetting angle is not necessarily a sign of a good inoculation potential...|$|R

The multi-attribute biomass and food {{production}} (BFP) problem facing farmers and co-operatives is further complicated by uncertainties in crop yield and prices. In this paper, we present a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming (MIP) model that maximizes the economic and environmental benefits of food and biofuel production. The uncertain parameters of yield amount and price level are calculated using real data. Economic aspects include revenue obtained from biomass and food crop sales as well as costs related to seeding, production, harvesting, and transportation operations at the farm level. Environmental effects include greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, carbon sequestration, soil erosion, and nitrogen leakage to water. The first-stage variables define binary decisions for allocating various land types to food and energy crops, while the second-stage variables are operational decisions related to harvesting, budget allocation, and amounts of different yield types. We present a decomposition algorithm, which is enhanced with specialized Benders cuts for solving this stochastic MIP problem. The computational efficiency of the proposed model and approach is demonstrated by applying it to a real case study involving switchgrass and corn production {{in the state of}} Kansas.

40|$|One of {{the most}} famous {{problems}} of early evolution is the reconstruction of the evolutionary processes creating a so-phisticated, enzymatically aided replication apparatus from a system of primitive self-replicating oligomers. It is known that the selectively maintained length, and thus the amount of information coded in replicators, are limited by their copying fidelity, and that this length was too short in the primordial phase to code for specific replicase en-zymes. However, as argued generally, copying accuracy could not be increased without the help of specific en-zymes. In this paper, we suggest a step-by-step solution to this paradoxical situation through studying both non-enzymatic or enzymatic replication. In the nonenzymatic case, longer templates may enhance replication fidelity by their structural modification, while longer macromolecules could be a bit more precise replicase enzymes in the enzymatic situation. If this increased copying accuracy is sufficiently high, and naturally if the longer replicators outcompete the shorter ones, then the information content maintained in the winner template is increased. I use simple strategic models to study the possibility of these coevolutionary processes. It is pointed out that the neces-sary per unit increase of copying fidelity decreases rapidly with increased template size, and it could be very small even at shorter templates. Comparing the results to experimental data suggests that most probably it is the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> replication and <b>decomposition</b> <b>of</b> macromolecules rather than copying accuracy, that limits the length of replicators...|$|R

Field programmable gate array (FPGA) can not provide the data processing speed that matches the sampling rate to perform direct wideband digital down conversion. That’s why a parallel architecture, which involves parallel <b>decomposition</b> <b>of</b> numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) and poly-phase <b>decomposition</b> <b>of</b> low pass filter, is presented in this paper. Mathematic expressions of multipath NCO digital local oscillators are especially stressed, and solution space <b>of</b> <b>decomposition</b> factor is also discussed. This presented architecture can effectively reduce operation rate and relieve computational pressure, which will benefit the following baseband signal processing components. Finally, simulation results of MATLAB and experimental platform are presented to illustrate the validity of the architecture...|$|R

The results show that C. maxillosus adults begin to appear during the ‘late-bloating’, ‘early-active’ phase and were present up to the earlier stages of the ‘remains’ phase. On average, they were first seen after about 6 days <b>of</b> <b>decomposition</b> (range <b>of</b> 5–7 days <b>of</b> <b>decomposition</b> [...] ) and the last C. maxillosus adults were observed on average on day 25 <b>of</b> <b>decomposition</b> (range <b>of</b> 14–38 days <b>of</b> <b>decomposition</b> [...] ).

40|$|Structural and {{functional}} changes in myosin of fast muscles during early post-natal development were studied to seek correlations with well-known physiological {{changes in the}} contraction rate. The findings were as follows: 1. It is known that fetal fast muscle myosin contains three kinds of light chains. It was confirmed that their molecular weights {{were the same as}} those of adult fast muscle myosin, but different from those of adult slow muscle myosin. The amount of the smallest light chain, g 3, was confirmed to increase markedly during the post-natal period. 2. The ATPase [EC 3. 6. 1. 3] activity of fetal fast muscle myosin (— 1 day) was found to be about 50 % of that of adult myosin. The pH-activity curve of fetal myosin ATPase was confirmed to be similar to that of adult myosin. ADP 3. The rate of formation of the reactive myosin-phosphate-ADP complex, Mp, was found not to change during post-natal development. 4. It was found that the rate <b>of</b> <b>decomposition</b> <b>of</b> Mp in the presence of F-actin increased markedly during the post-natal period, and that the rate <b>of</b> <b>decomposition</b> <b>of</b> the complex of fetal myosin was only 1 / 6 to 1 / 4 of that of adult myosin. The change in the actomyosin ATPase activity was found to be closely correlated with the increase in the g 3 content during development. Buller et al.

40|$|The Support Vector Machine {{classifier}} is {{a binary}} classifier applied to classify large datasets, which {{is ideal for}} the application <b>of</b> <b>decomposition</b> methods when processing memory is limited. However, the rates of convergence <b>of</b> the <b>decomposition</b> method are largely dependent on the sequence of decomposed problems solved.

We propose a measure of iteration that we call momentum and derive a prediction method to minimize the momentum of the updated iterates hitting the boundary constraints. Our prediction method uses a rough heuristic set to choose an approximately optimal sub problem to solve.
