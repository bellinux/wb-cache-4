25|$|Though Mies had {{emphasized}} {{his wish}} {{to complete the}} campus he had begun, commissions from the late 50s onward were given to Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), prompting Mies to never return to the campus that had changed architecture the world over. SOM architect Walter Netsch designed a few buildings, including the new library that Mies had wished to create, all of them similar to Mies's style. By the late 1960s, campus addition projects were given to SOM's Myron Goldsmith, {{who had worked with}} Mies during his education at IIT and thus was able to design several new buildings to harmonize well with the original campus. In 1976, the American Institute of Architects recognized the campus as one of the 200 most significant works of architecture in the United States. The new campus center, designed by Rem Koolhaas, and a new state-of-the-art residence hall designed by Helmut Jahn, State <b>Street</b> <b>Village,</b> opened in 2003. These were the first new buildings built on the Main Campus in 32 years.|$|E

Helmut Jahn, who studied architecture at IIT under Mies van der Rohe in the late 1960s, is responsible for the innovative design of the residence hall. The structure is composed of three separate five-story buildings, joined by exterior glass walls that muffle noise from passing trains on the adjacent [...] "L" [...] tracks. SSV houses 367 students in apartment-style and suite-style units.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the same}} time, David's mother Anne Mirvish spent five months {{studying}} sculpture at The New School in Greenwich Village, {{a result of}} the urging of artist Paul Burlin. As a youth, she painted and took art lessons, and her family were active in their appreciation of music. Upon marriage to Ed, those interests were largely displaced to help with the business. While Anne was away in New York City, David, who had just graduated from high school, told his father that he wanted to run an art gallery. [...] Since Anne had wanted David to attend university, a decision was postponed until her return; after overcoming some initial shock, she endorsed his plan. Anne Mirvish intended to get a studio in the Gerrard <b>Street</b> <b>Village,</b> an artist's neighbourhood. Just then, the community was displaced for a new parking lot for the Toronto General Hospital.|$|E
