40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the performance of seed drill with different covering devices of wheat seeds. The parameters used for evaluation were draft, seed depth, fuel consumption, number of plants/mt, power requirement and length of plant root. The experiment was designed as split plot and the main plot was the seed covering devices and the sub plot was forward speed. An instrumented tractor was used that consisted of sensitive sensors and a datalogger for measuring and recording performance parameters including fuel consumption, tractor forward speed and draft. Experiments were conducted with four types of seed covering devices named: <b>spike</b> <b>tooth,</b> wooden sweep, chains and smooth plastic wheel. Seed drill performance parameters were measured at various forward speeds (5. 94, 6. 53 and 7. 65 kmIh) and the planting depth was adjusted on 50 mm before planting. The results showed that there were significant differences among the used seed covering devices and forward speeds for all performance parameters were found. The <b>spike</b> <b>tooth</b> seed covering device had the smallest average value of draft compared with the other seed covering devices and was equal to 3. 85 kN as average for three forward speeds. On the other hand, the smooth plastic wheel seed covering device had the smallest average values of fuel consumption and seed depth, and big~est average values of length of plant root and number of plants/m compared with the other seed covering devices and were equal to 16. 36 litlh, 53. 11 rnm, 94. 3 rnm, and 174 plants/m' respectively as average for the three forward speeds...|$|E
40|$|The {{thorough}} investigation of both grain threshing and grain separating processes {{is a crucial}} consideration for effective structural design and variable optimization of the tangential flow threshing cylinder and longitudinal axial flow threshing cylinder composite units (TLFC unit) of small and medium-sized (SME) combine harvesters. The objective {{of this paper was}} to obtain the structural variables of a TLFC unit by theoretical modeling and experimentation on a tangential flow threshing cylinder unit (TFC unit) and longitudinal axial flow threshing cylinder unit (LFC unit). Threshing and separation equations for five types of threshing teeth (knife bar, trapezoidal tooth, <b>spike</b> <b>tooth,</b> rasp bar, and rectangular bar), were obtained using probability theory. Results demonstrate that the threshing and separation capacity of the knife bar TFC unit was stronger than the other threshing teeth. The length of the LFC unit was divided into four sections, with helical blades on the first section (0 - 0. 17 m), the <b>spike</b> <b>tooth</b> on the second section (0. 17 - 1. 48 m), the trapezoidal tooth on the third section (1. 48 - 2. 91 m), and the discharge plate on the fourth section (2. 91 - 3. 35 m). Test results showed an un-threshed grain rate of 0. 243 %, un-separated grain rate of 0. 346 %, and broken grain rate of 0. 184 %. Evidenced by these results, threshing and separation performance is significantly improved by analyzing and optimizing the structure and variables of a TLFC unit. The results of this research can be used to successfully design the TLFC unit of small and medium-sized (SME) combine harvesters. </p...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{need for}} in-situ soil {{moisture}} conservation in arid and semi-arid regions due to insufficient rainfall for agriculture. For this purpose, a combination implement [integrated reservoir tillage system (RT) ] comprised of a single-row chisel plow, single-row <b>spike</b> <b>tooth</b> harrow, modified seeder, and spiked roller was developed and compared to the popular tillage practices, viz., minimum tillage (MT) and conventional tillage (CT) in an arid Mediterranean environment in Egypt. The different tillage practices were conducted at tillage depths of 15, 20, and 25 cm and forward speeds of 0. 69, 1, 1. 25, and 1. 53 m s- 1. Some soil physical properties, runoff, soil loss, water harvesting efficiency and yield of wheat were evaluated.

Plant emergence and harvesting properties investigated were mean emergence dates, emerged rate index, percentage of emerged seedling, plant height, stem diameter, silage yield and dry matter yield. Soil moisture content, bulk density and penetration resistance varied from 24. 39 to 25. 42 %, and from 1. 24 to 1. 33 g/cm 3, and from 0. 58 to 1. 60 MPa, at 0 - 10 cm soil depth respectively; the same properties varied from 24. 65 to 25. 95 %, and from 1. 25 to 1. 34 g/cm 3, and from 0. 95 to 1. 60 MPa, at 10 - 20 cm soil depth respectively. For plant properties; mean emerged dates, emerged rate index, and percentage of emerged varied from 12. 80 to 12. 85 days, and from 0. 335 to 0. 346 seedling/m day, and from 86. 11 to 88. 61, respectively. Plant height, stem diameter, silage yield and dry matter yield varied from 244. 7 to 266. 2 cm, from 2. 88 to 3. 13 cm, from 7525. 89 to 7580. 80 kg/da, and from 1523. 36 to 1534. 35 kg/da, respectively. The results indicated that soil moisture content, bulk density and penetration resistance in conservational tillage system were higher than the conventional tillage system. Ridge planting system yielded higher values {{than that of the}} flat planting system. The emerged rate index, and percentage of emerged seedling in conservational tillage and flat planting systems were lower than conventional tillage and ridge planting system.

40|$|Two-wheel tractor (power tiller) is {{a common}} tillage tool in Bangladesh {{agriculture}} for easy access in fragmented land with affordable price of small farmers. Traditional maize sheller needs to be carried {{from place to place}} by hooking with two-wheel tractor (2 WT) and set up again for shelling operation which takes longer time for preparation of maize shelling. The mobile maize sheller eliminates the transportation problem and can start shelling operation instantly any place as it is attached together with 2 WT. It is counterclockwise rotating cylinder, axial flow type sheller, and grain separated with a frictional force between <b>spike</b> <b>tooth</b> and concave. The maize sheller is attached with nuts and bolts in front of the engine base of 2 WT. The operating power of the sheller comes from the fly wheel of the engine of the tractor through ‘V” belt pulley arrangement. The average shelling capacity of the mobile sheller is 2. 0 t/hr, broken kernel 2. 2 %, and shelling efficiency 97 %. The average maize shelling cost is Tk. 0. 22 /kg and traditional custom hire rate is Tk. 1. 0 /kg, respectively (1 US$=Tk. 78. 0).

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 Studies were {{conducted}} to establish some characters which could be used, either in the field or in the laboratory, to differentiate between annual ryegrass (Oregon), Lolium multiflorum Lam., and Linn perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne L.

Texture of the tillers, blade width, spikes length, spikelets length, glume length, callus shape of the rachilla, and rachilla length, seem to be relatively good characters for differentiating these species. Number of tillers, embracement of the auricles, number of spikelets per <b>spike,</b> <b>teeth</b> on the lemma, awns on the lemma, and weight of the seedlings are inadequate characters to differentiate between the species studied.

50|$|The {{first line}} of Spawn toys ever {{produced}} was released in 1994 and consisted of six figures, the hero Spawn and his medieval counterpart (aptly named Medieval Spawn) with Tremor and the villains Violator, Overt-Kill, and Clown, {{as well as a}} Spawn Alley Playset, the Spawnmobile and the Violator Monster Rig. They were notably different from the toys common on shelves at the time because of their level of detail in both sculpting and painting. Other toys utilized only a few colors painted in general areas (a singe flesh tone for the face, etc.) and were tacked to cardboard backs. McFarlane's figures had individual items such as <b>spikes,</b> <b>teeth,</b> claws, and buttons painted individually and packaged encased by hard plastic that surrounded both the figure and blister card, making them more suitable collectors items. Each toy in the first line came with a regular-sized comic (although with fewer pages than the standard 22), which were individualized to the character.|$|R

5000|$|The unique long-handled [...] "Thai" [...] type two-wheel tractor was {{developed}} in the late 1950s by M.R. Debriddhi Devakul (M.R. stands for Mom Rajawong, meaning that his great-grandfather was the King of Thailand, and that he could be properly addressed as [...] "Prince"), head of the Engineering Division of the Thai Rice Department, of the Thai Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. As the early 2WTs did not have steering clutches, longer handles were provided for turning and controlling the tractor more easily in fields. Initially the engines were taken from kerosene engine powered irrigation pumps, but as the popularity of the tractor became obvious (known as the [...] "Iron Buffalo"), three Japanese firms set up diesel engine factories in Thailand with agreements to progressively increase local content. Later, steering clutches were provided on many companies' models. The tractor gear box and chassis are made by many local industries (Samakkee Lohakij Ltd., Agri-Mechanics Co Ltd., Ayutthaya Tractor Factory, Cosmonoki Thai International Co. Ltd., C.R. Tractor Co Ltd, Inter Kankaset Co. Ltd, Jakpetch Tractor Co. Ltd., Jor Charoenchai Tractor, Kor Rungruang, Muileng Industry Ltd., Samakkee Lohakij Ltd., Siam Kubota Industry Co. Ltd., etc.). Initially, factories copied from one another, and competing for sales {{to the point that the}} tractor's chassis without engine has become very inexpensive, about one third to one half the cost of the engine. The [...] "Thai tractor" [...] eventually evolved into a more general standard [...] "NC" [...] type models with three gears forward, one reverse, and steering clutches. Attachments that are available are moldboard and disc plows, <b>spiked</b> <b>tooth</b> harrows, trailed-type (non-powered) rotary puddlers (lateral drums with protruding paddles), various types of levelers and simple trailers (usually without brakes or lights). Recently (2010), a new NC Plus model offered by Siam Kubota comes with a [...] (PTO) that can drive a rotary tiller and other attachments. Additionally many farmers use V-belts to connect the stationary tractor engine to power centrifugal pumps and axial flow pumps, rice threshers, maize shellers etc. Recently inexpensive Chinese-made NC models have come on the international market but attempts by Siam Kubota and others to keep them out of Thailand, Cambodia and elsewhere due to claims of copyright infringement. Through the 1980s and 1990s, more than 50,000 tractors were reportedly being produced and sold each year and by 2006 more than 70,000 were being produced and even more imported so that estimates of 2WT population is between 1.7 - 2.0 million 2WTs in Thailand.|$|R
