40|$|People {{suffering}} from degenerative hip or knee joints find sitting and rising from a seated position very difficult. These people {{can rely on}} large stationary chairs at home, but must ask others for assistance when rising from any other chair. An orthopedic surgeon identified to the MSFC Technology Utilization Office the need for development of a portable device that could perform a similar function to the stationary lift chairs. The MSFC Structural Development Branch answered the Technology Utilization Office's request for design of a portable powered <b>seat</b> <b>lift.</b> The device is a seat cushion that opens under power, lifting the user to near-standing positions. The largest challenge was developing a mechanism to provide a stable lift over the large range of motion needed, and fold flat enough to be comfortable to sit on. CAD 3 -D modeling was used to generate complete drawings for the prototype, and a full-scale working model of the <b>Seat</b> <b>lift</b> was made based on the drawings. The working model is of low strength, but proves {{the function of the}} mechanism and the concept...|$|E

When the Coalition agreement automatically expired following the election loss, the two parties opted not to renew it. This decision meant that the Liberals lost their status as members of the Official Opposition (this place being taken by the National Party alone).|$|R

40|$|Currently {{there is}} a lack of {{assistance}} in automobile usage for the older people of our society. In an attempt to combat this problem, this thesis designs and builds a working conceptual model of a handicapped car <b>lifting</b> <b>seat.</b> An initial cost analysis is performed, an apparatus is designed, all necessary materials are gathered, an apparatus is constructed, and the device is tested. The result was the successful completion of a device that successfully assists in the lifting of up to a 300 lb. person out of their car. With some further development, this handicapped car <b>lifting</b> <b>seat</b> could hopefully be used in real life. by Sean A. Schoenmakers. Thesis (S. B.)

50|$|In {{the loading}} position, the seat {{carriage}} {{is at the}} base of the tower and the piston is at the top of the pipe column. Once the ride has been loaded, the <b>seats</b> are <b>lifted</b> slightly off the ground and loaded seats are weighed in order to calculate the amount of air pressure needed to safely propel the seats up the tower. Upon charging the air system to the correct pressure, compressed air is injected into the central column pushing the piston rapidly downward. As the piston moves down, it pulls the cable downward over the pulley at the top, propelling the seat carriage up the outside of the tower.|$|R
