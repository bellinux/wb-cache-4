5|$|The bulky body of Styracosaurus resembled {{that of a}} rhinoceros. It had {{powerful}} shoulders {{which may}} have been useful in intraspecies combat. Styracosaurus had a relatively short tail. Each toe bore a hooflike ungual which was <b>sheathed</b> in horn.|$|E
30|$|Pan and Shan (2011) {{focused on}} the {{experimental}} study of the structural strength of cold-formed steel wall frames with <b>sheathing</b> under monotonic shear loading. Based on the test result analysis, the ductility ratio of the specimen with one-side <b>sheathing</b> was {{greater than that of}} the specimen with two-side <b>sheathing.</b> The ultimate strength of wall frame with <b>sheathing</b> increased with increase in the thickness of board.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} was to report 2 {{patients}} (3 eyes) with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) who showed marked <b>sheathing</b> of the retinal arterioles that was ultimately attributed to calcification following vitrectomy. Cases: Case 1 involved a 65 -year-old female with PDR who underwent bilateral vitrectomy for traction retinal detachment. Postoperatively, bilateral retinal redetachment (reRD) was observed. <b>Sheathing</b> of the retinal arterioles was observed at the same time, yet was not apparent preoperatively. Case 2 involved a 71 -year-old female with PDR who underwent vitrectomy for vitreous hemorrhage. Postoperatively, reRD was observed, and fundus findings showed <b>sheathing</b> of the retinal arterioles. In both patients, silicone oil tamponade and retinopexy were performed at reoperation, but <b>sheathing</b> of the retinal arterioles persisted postoperatively. Fluorescein fundus angiography showed that retinal blood flow was maintained, and no vessel leakage occurred. In addition, no <b>sheathing</b> of the retinal veins was observed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a higher intensity for retinal arterioles with <b>sheathing</b> than for normal retinal arterioles. Conclusion: Vessel <b>sheathing</b> in our 2 patients (3 eyes) differed from the <b>sheathing</b> seen in vasculitis. Based on the hyperintensity on OCT, this <b>sheathing</b> may have been due to retinal artery calcification induced by hypoxia and inflammation associated with reRD...|$|R

5|$|Another of the property's buildings, {{commonly}} called the carriage house, never {{lived up to}} its popular name. The building never housed any carriages; it was, in fact, built to house automobiles. The southern section of the carriage house was constructed sometime between 1908 and 1912 and features a mansard roof. The building is <b>sheathed</b> in stucco and presently houses a collection of antique carriages and sleighs as well as a barbed wire history museum.|$|E
5|$|Leaves : Simple, entire (smooth and even), linear, oval to {{filiform}} (thread-like), {{mostly with}} parallel veins, but occasionally net-veined. They are alternate (single and alternating direction) and spiral, {{but may be}} whorled (three or more attached at one node, e.g. Lilium, Fritillaria), cauline (arranged along the aerial stem) or <b>sheathed</b> in a basal rosette. They are rarely petiolate (stem attached before apex), and lack stipules. The aerial stem is unbranched.|$|E
5|$|The church's {{community}} building, a non-contributing structure {{within the}} historic boundary, is {{southwest of the}} church. The building is a venue for Sunday school classes and community gatherings. The front gable building, completed in 1961, is <b>sheathed</b> in brickwork. Similar to the church, the building is built into a gently sloping bank with its one-story elevation at grade facing west toward WV 259. Its two-story eastern elevation is {{at the foot of}} the hillside.|$|E
30|$|However, {{there are}} many {{disadvantages}} associated with using outdoor exposure tests as a standard test. The main disadvantage is that the test results strongly depend on the climatic conditions of exposure site [11, 12]. Another disadvantage is a concern that the mechanisms of degradation may differ between outdoor exposure and actual environmental conditions under such as wall <b>sheathing,</b> roof <b>sheathing,</b> and floor <b>sheathing.</b>|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} feature of English cathedrals, uncommon elsewhere except in Normandy, is the large and often elaborate square central tower over the crossing. The larger of these towers range from 55 metres (182ft) at Wells to 82.5 metres (271ft) at Lincoln. The central tower may exist as a single feature as at Salisbury, Gloucester, Worcester, Norwich and Chichester or in combination with paired towers at the west front as at York, Lincoln, Canterbury, Durham and Wells. Among the cathedrals that have three towers, the central tower is usually much the tallest. At Southwell the two western towers are capped by pyramidal spires <b>sheathed</b> in lead.|$|E
5|$|Calabria was {{designed}} for use in Italy's colonial empire, rather than the earlier vessels intended as fleet scouts. As such, her steel hull was <b>sheathed</b> with wood and then a layer of zinc {{to protect it from}} fouling during lengthy tours in the overseas colonies. Additionally, she was equipped with less powerful though more efficient engines than the earlier cruisers. The ship was otherwise similar to preceding designs like the Regioni class, having a displacement only slightly lower and a nearly identical gun battery.|$|E
5|$|Leather was not {{infrequently}} used {{even for}} the costly and elaborate chairs of the faldstool form—occasionally <b>sheathed</b> in thin plates of silver—which Venice sent all over Europe. To this day, indeed, leather {{is one of the}} most frequently employed materials for chair covering. The outstanding characteristic of most chairs until the middle of the 17th century was massiveness and solidity. Being usually made of oak, they were of considerable weight, and it was not until the introduction of the handsome Louis XIII chairs with cane backs and seats that either weight or solidity was reduced.|$|E

5|$|The main barn is {{oriented}} on a north–south axis and has {{a conventional}} bent framing and <b>sheathed</b> with vertical boards. It is believed that {{the addition of a}} cupola with a hip roof may have been a later addition to the barn. Photos dating from 1870 confirm its age, but the date of construction for the barn cannot be determined, but it may date from the 18th century. The former ell of the house was converted in a shed and dates to around 1780.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{comes in}} the form of both avoidable random {{encounters}} and scripted fights where the camera is fixed within the fighting area: enemies and bosses are primarily drawn from Japanese folklore and mythology. Battles are triggered only when enemies are near, with the player character otherwise keeping their weapons <b>sheathed.</b> In combat, characters attack and guard using a single-button prompt, while another button accesses items such as healing potions. Continuously attacking triggers combos. Different moves include sword slashes combined with directional buttons, which have different effects such as throwing an enemy into the air with an upward slash. Additional offensive items such as smoke bombs are acquired during the course of the game. At the end of each battle, experience points are awarded to the player character depending on how fast the battle was finished: leveling up increases a character's health, stats, and the amount of damage inflicted upon enemies.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{apparent}} cheapness of manufacture of their basic components, many surviving examples of Late Roman helmets, including the Intercisa type, show evidence of expensive decoration {{in the form}} of silver or silver-gilt sheathing. A possible explanation {{is that most of the}} surviving exemplars may have belonged to officers and that silver- or gold-plating denoted rank; and, in the case of mounted gemstones, high rank e.g. the ornate Deurne helmet, believed by some historians to have belonged to a senior officer. Other academics, in contrast, consider that silver-sheathed helmets may have been widely worn by comitatenses soldiers, given as a form of pay or reward. Roman law indicates that all helmets of this construction were supposed to be <b>sheathed</b> in a specific amount of gold or silver.|$|E

50|$|For {{individual}} strand tendons, {{no additional}} tendon ducting is used and no post-stressing grouting operation is required, unlike for bonded post-tensioning. Permanent corrosion {{protection of the}} strands {{is provided by the}} combined layers of grease, plastic <b>sheathing,</b> and surrounding concrete. Where strands are bundled to form a single unbonded tendon, an enveloping duct of plastic or galvanised steel is used and its interior free-spaces grouted after stressing. In this way, additional corrosion protection is provided via the grease, plastic <b>sheathing,</b> grout, external <b>sheathing,</b> and surrounding concrete layers.|$|R
50|$|On 20 June 1783 the Superb {{took part}} in the Battle of Cuddalore before {{returning}} to Bombay for copper <b>sheathing</b> along her hull. On 7 November she developed a severe leak through the <b>sheathing</b> into the bilge, and sank in Tellicherry Roads off the Bombay coast.|$|R
5|$|In 1870, a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the Senate called the Arctic Resolution, to fund an expedition to the North Pole. Hall, aided by the Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson, successfully lobbied for, and received, a grant of $50,000 from the U.S. Congress to command the expedition and began recruiting personnel in late 1870. He secured the U.S. Navy tugboat Periwinkle, a 387-ton screw-propelled steamer. At the Washington Navy Yard the ship was fitted as a fore topsail schooner, and renamed Polaris. She was prepared for Arctic service by the addition of solid oak timber all over her hull, and the bow was <b>sheathed</b> in iron. A new engine was added, and one of the boilers was retrofitted to burn seal or whale oil.|$|E
5|$|Many of the scutes are {{strengthened}} by bony plates known as osteoderms, {{which are the}} same size and shape as the superficial scales but grow beneath them. They are most numerous on the back and neck of the animal and may form a protective armour. They often have prominent, lumpy ridges and are covered in hard-wearing beta-keratin. Most of the skin on the head is fused to the skull. The skin on the neck and flanks is loose, while that on the abdomen and underside of the tail is <b>sheathed</b> in large, flat square scutes arranged in neat rows. The scutes contain blood vessels and may act to absorb or radiate heat during thermoregulation. Research also suggests that alkaline ions released into the blood from the calcium and magnesium in these dermal bones act as a buffer during prolonged submersion when increasing levels of carbon dioxide would otherwise cause acidosis.|$|E
5|$|Smith's script, titled Superman Lives, had Brainiac sending Doomsday to kill Superman, {{as well as}} {{blocking}} out the sun to make Superman powerless, as Superman is fueled by sunlight. Brainiac teams up with Lex Luthor, but Superman is resurrected by a Kryptonian robot, the Eradicator. Brainiac wishes to possess the Eradicator and its technology. Powerless, the resurrected Superman is <b>sheathed</b> in a robotic suit formed from the Eradicator itself until his powers return, courtesy of sunbeams, and defeats Brainiac. Smith's casting choices included Ben Affleck as Clark Kent/Superman, Linda Fiorentino as Lois Lane, Jack Nicholson as Lex Luthor, Famke Janssen as Mercy, John Mahoney as Perry White, David Hyde Pierce as the Eradicator, Jason Lee as Brainiac and Jason Mewes as Jimmy Olsen.|$|E

30|$|Vascular {{involvement}} in CMV retinitis {{can result in}} vascular <b>sheathing.</b> Exudates around retinal vessels, more commonly veins, can result in focal areas of fluffy white cuffing or <b>sheathing,</b> with or without skip areas [11]. When the perivascular <b>sheathing</b> is severe, the retinal arteries and veins appear frosted, and the term “frosted branch angiitis” is used to describe this entity [12]. Kyrieleis plaques can be differentiated from vascular <b>sheathing</b> and frosted branch angiitis by its clinical and fluorescein angiographic features. Kyrieleis plaques affect only the retinal arteries in contrast to frosted branch angiitis that involves both the retinal arteries and veins. In addition, Kyrieleis plaques are confined to the vessel wall and do not leak fluorescein dye in contrast to frosted branch angiitis that extends outside the vessel wall and extensively leaks fluorescein dye [12, 13].|$|R

Its basement level has one entrance, flanked by wooden double-hung sash windows and four casement windows. The northeastern elevation has three stained-glass windows on the main level, with three wooden eight-over-eight double-hung sash windows; a single wooden six-over-six double-hung sash window is in the gable. The building is roofed with asphalt shingles, and a brick chimney is along the slope of the northern elevation's roof line. Its northeastern elevation has five wooden 16-over-16 double-hung sash windows on the main level and four on the lower level, in addition to two wooden four-over-four sash windows.|$|E
5|$|The giant {{freshwater}} stingray is not aggressive, but its sting is <b>sheathed</b> in toxic mucus and {{is capable}} of piercing bone. Across its range, this species is caught incidentally by artisanal fishers using longlines, {{and to a lesser}} extent gillnets and fish traps. It is reputedly difficult and time-consuming to catch; a hooked ray may bury itself under large quantities of mud, becoming almost impossible to lift, or drag boats over substantial distances or underwater. The meat and the cartilage are used; large specimens are cut into kilogram pieces for sale. Adults that are not used for food are often killed or maimed by fishers nonetheless. In the Mae Klong and Bang Pakong Rivers, the giant freshwater stingray is also increasingly targeted by sport fishers and for display in public aquariums. These trends pose conservation concerns; the former because catch and release is not universally practised and the post-release survival rate is unknown, the latter because this species does not survive well in captivity.|$|E
5|$|The peridioles {{are about}} 1 to 1.5mm wide and rarely up to 2mm wide. They are disc-shaped, but may appear angular due to {{pressure}} from neighbouring peridioles. Peridioles may be dark, or a drab gray if still covered with a thin membrane called a tunica.Peridioles in C.striatus are <b>sheathed</b> and attached to the endoperidium by complex cords of mycelia known as a funiculus in the singular. The funiculus is differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. Inside the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at {{one end to the}} peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. When dry the funiculus is brittle, but when wet it is capable of long extension.|$|E
40|$|A case of arteriosclerotic {{retinopathy}} {{associated with}} retinal venous thrombosis {{was treated with}} Anginin and the following results obtained: 1) Visual acuity was improved from 0. 03 to 0. 7. 2) Retinal hemorrhages were absorbed and pipe-stem <b>sheathing</b> of the branch of retinal artery decrease, with white <b>sheathing</b> remaining partially. 3) It was therefore considered that the pipe-stem <b>sheathing</b> was decreased because Anginin removed venous spasm and improved the blood stream of the branch of the artery, and that the organic changes already established on the arterial wall would remain as white <b>sheathing.</b> 4) Anginin could not prevent retinal veins from changing into white lines. 5) Consequently the authors considered that Anginin may be a drug effectively used for retinal arteriosclerosis and retinal venous thrombosis associated therewith. </p...|$|R
40|$|This book {{provides}} an experimental analysis of timber-framed walls, coated with single <b>sheathing</b> boards fastened to a timber frame, usually used as main bearing capacity {{elements in the}} construction of prefabricated timber structures. As designers or producers usually find themselves in an important dilemma which <b>sheathing</b> board is better to use according to the known height and location of the building, the aim of the presented analysis is comparison of the results measured on test samples covered either with fibre-plaster or wood-based <b>sheathing</b> boards. Therefore, the presented conclusions, supported by the measured results, give some important indications in behaviour of the timber-frame wall elements covered with different <b>sheathing</b> boards according to the known horizontal load and consequently, could give some important recommendations in designing of tall timber-frame buildings located on heavy windy or seismic area...|$|R
30|$|Abbasi and Komatsu [1] {{adopted a}} {{proteomics}} approach to identify proteins that increase in abundance in leaf <b>sheathes,</b> roots, and leaf blades of 2 -week-old rice seedlings subjected to salt stress. In leaf <b>sheathes</b> exposed to NaCl, eight proteins consistently showed significant changes. Of these eight proteins, three remain unidentified, {{but the other}} five were identified as photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex protein, two fructose bisphosphate aldolases, oxygen-evolving enhancer protein (OEE) 2, and SOD. The study also revealed that increased expression of SOD is a common response to cold, drought, salt, and ABA stresses in the leaf sheath. This shows that the accumulation of SOD in response to salt, drought, or cold stresses has a general role in protecting against stress conditions. Under salt stress, enhanced expression of OEE 2, aldolase, and photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex protein was detected in the leaf <b>sheathes</b> and leaf blades. SOD {{and one of the}} unidentified proteins were also detected in salt-stressed leaf <b>sheathes</b> and roots. Another unidentified protein was expressed in leaf <b>sheathes,</b> but was below the limits of detection in leaf blades and roots.|$|R
