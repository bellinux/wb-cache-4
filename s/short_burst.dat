Seeing Lindwall struggle through the pain barrier, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller at the start off the second over {{to see if he}} could lift and bowl as well. However, Miller threw the ball back to his captain, indicating that his body would not be able to withstand the strain. This resulted in media speculation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 3 {{version of}} Flow {{features}} enhanced visuals and three additional playable organisms: {{one that can}} move with a <b>short</b> <b>burst</b> of speed, one that can paralyze other creatures, and one that lunges toward its prey's weak point. The worm creature from the original game was given {{the ability to move}} faster, while the jellyfish may now create a vortex to attract small creatures. These special moves are activated by hitting any button on the controller. When the player reaches the bottom plane with each creature, the next creature type is unlocked and becomes selectable {{at the beginning of the}} game. The PlayStation 3 version features a multiplayer mode for up to four players; a game in progress can be joined at any time, players may play different creatures if they desire so. The PlayStation Portable version contains all of the features introduced by PlayStation 3 version, but reduces the size of each plane. On November 20, 2007, the PlayStation 3 version received an add-on pack that allows players joining a multiplayer game to select their creatures. The pack also includes new enemies, food types, and a playable creature with a shield ability.|$|E
40|$|The Swift {{data set}} on short GRBs has now grown {{large enough to}} study {{correlations}} of key parameters. The goal is to compare long and <b>short</b> <b>bursts</b> to better understand similarities and differences in the burst origins. In this study we consider the both prompt and afterglow fluxes. It is found that the optical, X-ray and gamma-ray emissions are linearly correlated - stronger bursts tend to have brighter afterglows, and bursts with brighter X-ray afterglow tend to have brighter optical afterglow. Both the prompt and afterglow fluxes are, on average, lower for <b>short</b> <b>bursts</b> than for long. Although there are short GRBs with undetected optical emission, {{there is no evidence}} for "dark" <b>short</b> <b>bursts</b> with anomalously low opt/X ratios.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{temporal and}} spectral properties, {{focusing on the}} <b>short</b> <b>bursts,</b> for three anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) and soft gamma repeaters (SGRs), including SGR 1806 - 20, 1 E 1048 - 5937 and SGR 0501 + 4516. Using the data from XMM-Newton, we located the <b>short</b> <b>bursts</b> by Bayesian blocks algorithm. The short bursts' duration distributions for three sources were fitted by two lognormal functions. The spectra of <b>shorter</b> <b>bursts</b> (< 0. 2 s) and longer bursts (≥ 0. 2 s) can be well fitted in two blackbody components model or optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung model for SGR 0501 + 4516. We also found {{that there is a}} positive correlation between the burst luminosity and the persistent luminosity with a power law index γ = 1. 23 ± 0. 18. The energy ratio of this persistent emission to the time averaged <b>short</b> <b>bursts</b> is in the range of 10 - 10 ^ 3, being comparable to the case in Type I X-ray burst.

Some types of buoys, such as those used for the tsunami warning system, use Iridium satellites to communicate with their base. The remote device is programmed to call or send SBD (<b>Short</b> <b>burst</b> data, see below) messages to the base at specified intervals, or it can be set to accept calls in order for it to offload its collected data. Most of these units can be connected to a handset and used as a fixed telephone.|$|E
25|$|This {{model has}} been well-supported so far by the {{distribution}} of short GRB host galaxies, which have been observed in old galaxies with no star formation (for example, GRB050509B, the first <b>short</b> <b>burst</b> to be localized to a probable host) {{as well as in}} galaxies with star formation still occurring (such as GRB050709, the second), as even younger-looking galaxies can have significant populations of old stars. However, the picture is clouded somewhat by the observation of X-ray flaring in short GRBs out to very late times (up to many days), long after the merger should have been completed, and the failure to find nearby hosts of any sort for some short GRBs.|$|E
40|$|The main {{evidence}} of the internal-external scenario within the fireball model of GRBs is their high variability. External shocks cannot produce variable bursts and therefore, according to this model, the gamma-ray emission produced by internal shocks while the afterglow produced by the following external shock. So far the variability was shown only in long bursts (BATSE T 90 > 2 sec). It is not known whether <b>short</b> <b>bursts,</b> which form a different class, are produced in the same way. We have developed an algorithm which is sensitive enough to analyze the temporal structure of <b>short</b> <b>bursts.</b> We analyze a sample of bright <b>short</b> <b>bursts</b> from the BATSE 4 B-catalog and find that many <b>short</b> <b>bursts</b> are highly variable (dt_min/T<< 1, where dt_min is the shortest pulse). This indicates that <b>short</b> <b>bursts,</b> like long ones, are produced by internal shocks. We also use the same algorithm to analyze the high resolution (TTE) data of long bursts (only the first 1 - 2 seconds of each burst). We find that 10 ms time-scales are common in long bursts. This result show that long bursts are even more variable then it was thought before (dt_min/T~ 10 ^[- 4 }- 10 ^{- 3 }) ...|$|R
40|$|Correlation {{studies of}} prompt and {{afterglow}} emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) between different spectral bands {{have been difficult}} to do in the past because few bursts had comprehensive and comparable afterglow measurements. In this paper we present a large and uniform data set for correlation analysis based on bursts detected by the Swift mission. For the first time, <b>short</b> and long <b>bursts</b> can be analyzed and compared. It is found for both classes that the optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission are linearly correlated, but with a large spread about the correlation line; stronger bursts tend to have brighter afterglow, and bursts with brighter X-ray afterglow tend to have brighter optical afterglow. <b>Short</b> <b>bursts</b> are, on average, weaker in both prompt and afterglow emission. No <b>short</b> <b>bursts</b> are seen with extremely low optical-to-X-ray ratios, as occurs for "dark" long bursts. Although statistics are still poor for <b>short</b> <b>bursts,</b> there is no evidence yet for a subgroup of <b>short</b> <b>bursts</b> with high extinction, as there is for long bursts. Long bursts are detected in the dark category in the same fraction as pre-Swift bursts. Interesting cases of long bursts that are detected in the optical, and yet have a low enough optical-to-X-ray ratio to be classified as dark, are discovered. For the prompt emission, <b>short</b> and long <b>bursts</b> have different average tracks on flux versus fluence plots. In Swift, GRB detections tend to be fluence-limited for <b>short</b> <b>bursts</b> and flux-limited for long events...|$|R

Their initial bolometric luminosities are L ~ 10 ^ 34 - 10 ^ 35 erg s^- 1.

25|$|Short gamma-ray bursts {{appear to}} be an exception. Until 2007, only a handful of these events have been {{localized}} to a definite galactic host. However, those that have been localized appear to show significant differences from the long-burst population. While at least one <b>short</b> <b>burst</b> has been found in the star-forming central region of a galaxy, several others have been associated with the outer regions and even the outer halo of large elliptical galaxies in which star formation has nearly ceased. All the hosts identified so far have also been at low redshift. Furthermore, despite the relatively nearby distances and detailed follow-up study for these events, no supernova has been associated with any short GRB.|$|E
25|$|The role of full back {{who wears}} the number 3 jersey {{is one of}} the most {{important}} in Gaelic football or hurling. As well as defending against attackers, the full back is responsible for organising the defence and is the key defender in front of goals, and is usually one of the tallest and strongest players on the team. The full back plays most often around the 20-metre line. The position of the full back requires that the player have decent speed over short bursts, strength, and good hand eye co-ordination. In playing either cornerback or full back positions a well-developed aerobic system is required although, unlike the corner backs, the full back is needed to make <b>short</b> <b>burst</b> sprints both away from and into the goal area.|$|E
