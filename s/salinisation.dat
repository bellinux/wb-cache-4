5|$|About 92% of Bahrain is desert with {{periodic}} droughts {{and dust}} storms, the main natural hazards for Bahrainis. Environmental issues facing Bahrain include desertification {{resulting from the}} degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as Tubli Bay. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its <b>salinisation</b> by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified {{the locations of the}} sources of aquifer <b>salinisation</b> and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of <b>salinisation</b> of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of sabkha water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each <b>salinisation</b> source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.|$|E
5|$|Kerala's fauna are {{notable for}} their {{diversity}} and {{high rates of}} endemism: it includes 118 species of mammals (1 endemic), 500 species of birds, 189 species of freshwater fish, 173 species of reptiles (10 of them endemic), and 151 species of amphibians (36 endemic). These are threatened by extensive habitat destruction, including soil erosion, landslides, <b>salinisation,</b> and resource extraction. In the forests, sonokeling, Dalbergia latifolia, anjili, mullumurikku, Erythrina, and Cassia number {{among the more than}} 1,000 species of trees in Kerala. Other plants include bamboo, wild black pepper, wild cardamom, the calamus rattan palm, and aromatic vetiver grass, Vetiveria zizanioides. Indian elephant, Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, Nilgiri tahr, common palm civet, and grizzled giant squirrels are also found in the forests. Reptiles include the king cobra, viper, python, and mugger crocodile. Kerala's birds include the Malabar trogon, the great hornbill, Kerala laughingthrush, darter and southern hill myna. In the lakes, wetlands, and waterways, fish such as kadu; stinging catfish and choottachi; orange chromideâ€”Etroplus maculatus are found.|$|E
25|$|Major {{threats to}} the natural {{biodiversity}} and ecological balance of the sanctuary are: loss of habitat for waterbirds, soil and water <b>salinisation</b> by adjacent salt pans, spread of the invasive Prosopis juliflora, cattle grazing and scarcity of fresh water.

25|$|In 2015, the United Nations {{engineered}} the Sustainable Development Goals, replacing the Millennium Development Goals. The goals focus on health, education, poverty, hunger, climate change, water sanitation, and hygiene. A major focus was {{clean water and}} <b>salinisation.</b> Experts working on this field have designed the WASH concept. WASH focuses on safe drinkable water, hygiene, and proper sanitation. The group has had {{a major impact on}} the sub-Saharan region of Africa, particularly the Ivory Coast. By 2030, they plan to have universal and equal access to safe and affordable drinking water.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the issues}} that {{flooding}} brings, such as soil <b>salinisation,</b> the island states themselves would also become dissolved over time, as the islands become uninhabitable or completely submerged by the sea. Once this happens, all rights on the surrounding area (sea) are removed. This area can be huge as rights extend to a radius of 224 nautical miles (414km) around the entire island state. Any resources, such as fossil oil, minerals and metals, within this area can be freely dug up by anyone and sold without needing to pay any commission to the (now dissolved) island state.|$|E
25|$|Current {{predictions}} {{based on}} the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report 2007 say that Climate Change might impact the countries closer to the equator more seriously than the countries located more in the North or South. Tropical Vietnam {{is assumed to be}} one of the most vulnerable countries in connection with Climate Change. The medium emission level scenario for 2080-2099 predicts a higher annual rainfall which occurs in the already wet months of the year. At the same time, the dry months might become even hotter due to temperature rise and the stress on the crops might increase due to higher evaporation rates and less available water. Like the current climate differs both in time and in space, also the changing climate is predicted to affect rather the North than the South and it might influence rather the winter than the summer months. Beneath rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns, sea level rise is predicted to affect Vietnam as a country with a coastal line of more than 3,000km especially. The loss of land and soils due to flooding and inundation might lead to a loss of 5% of the total land seriously affecting agriculture, industry, human and natural environment. Salt water intrusion and <b>salinisation</b> of soils and irrigation water (either groundwater or surface water of other water bodies) are predicted to cause serious problems in connection with sea level rise as well.|$|E
2500|$|This {{position}} was soon {{left by the}} scholarly community, noticing that no evidence was found, and that the skeletons {{were found to be}} hasty interments, not massacred victims. Wheeler himself also nuanced this interpretation in later publications, stating [...] "This is a possibility, but it can't be proven, and it may not be correct." [...] Wheeler further notes that the unburied corpses may indicate an event in the final phase of human occupation of Mohenjo-Daro, and that thereafter the place was uninhabited, but that the decay of Mohenjo-Daro has to be ascribed to structural causes such as <b>salinisation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Southern Iraq during Akkadian period {{seems to}} have been {{approaching}} its modern rainfall level of less than [...] per year, with the result that agriculture was totally dependent upon irrigation. Before the Akkadian period the progressive <b>salinisation</b> of the soils, produced by poorly drained irrigation, had been reducing yields of wheat {{in the southern part of}} the country, leading to the conversion to more salt-tolerant barley growing. Urban populations there had peaked already by 2,600 BC, and demographic pressures were high, contributing to the rise of militarism apparent immediately before the Akkadian period (as seen in the Stele of the Vultures of Eannatum). Warfare between city states had led to a population decline, from which Akkad provided a temporary respite. It was this high degree of agricultural productivity in the south that enabled the growth of the highest population densities in the world at this time, giving Akkad its military advantage.|$|E

50|$|The basin {{irrigation}} method did not exact {{too much of}} the soils, and their fertility was sustained by the annual silt deposit. <b>Salinisation</b> did not occur, since in summer, the ground water level was well below the surface, and any salinity which might have accrued was washed away by the next flood.|$|E
50|$|The {{first time}} that water access {{entitlements}} were separated from land title in Australia was in 1983, when South Australia introduced a permanent water trading scheme. Like many other countries, Australiaâ€™s irrigation sector was subject to centralised control {{for more than a}} century. Many irrigation settlements were placed in inappropriate parts of the landscape where the risks of waterlogging, land <b>salinisation</b> or river <b>salinisation</b> were high and returns from production were low. Farm sizes on irrigated settlements were also initially based on non-commercial criteria like â€˜the home maintenance areaâ€™ (the maximum area necessary to support one family - as judged by government). Irrigators were in this way condemned to a frugal existence from the start. Changing commodity markets and above all changing irrigation technologies amplified these initial errors and left Australian irrigation with difficult adjustment problems.|$|E
50|$|Although sand theft {{does not}} seem to be a serious problem at first, it is {{nonetheless}} a serious problem as the removal of sand facilitates soil <b>salinisation.</b> For example, in Cape Verde, the theft of sand has caused the soil to salinify to such a degree, that a large number of orchards were permanently destroyed in the process.|$|E
50|$|Dryness, and {{in places}} also {{stoniness}} and/or {{the presence of}} a shallow petrocalcic horizon, limit the suitability of Calcisols for agriculture. If irrigated, drained (to prevent <b>salinisation)</b> and fertilised, Calcisols can be highly productive under a wide variety of crops. Hilly areas with Calcisols are predominantly used for low volume grazing of cattle, sheep and goats.|$|E
50|$|The main {{threats to}} Toolibinâ€™s {{ecological}} community are <b>salinisation</b> and waterlogging due to clearing of the catchment for dry-land agriculture, particularly wool and cereal grain production; eutrophication caused by run-off containing agricultural fertilizers; invasive weeds changing {{the structure of}} the ecosystem and reducing natural vegetation available for food and shelter for animals; and grazing of regenerating seedlings by kangaroos, livestock and rabbits.|$|E
50|$|Cazenave is {{a member}} of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and was the lead author of the sea level {{sections}} of the 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report and the 2014 IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. Cazenave has called attention to the effects of climate change on sea level rising. She has indicated that extremely flat regions such as Bangladesh could have their groundwater threatened by sea <b>salinisation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The best {{management}} approach to these soils {{is simply to}} avoid their disturbance. maintaining vegetation cover of the soil {{is also important to}} minimize soil dispersion. In agricultural systems, this may mean making an effort to prevent surface soil loss and/or damage, as the surface soil and ground cover form a protective barrier. Landscape-scale management of excess salt is also important, as secondary <b>salinisation</b> can induce dispersive behaviour in soil.|$|E
50|$|Black-backed bitterns {{are listed}} as Near Threatened nationally in Australia, and as Endangered in Victoria. The global {{population}} has been estimated to comprise about 5000 mature individuals, mainly within Australia, including a sub-population of more than 1000 individuals in south-western Western Australia. Threats include various ongoing wetland degradation factors such as <b>salinisation,</b> drainage and the diversion of water for irrigation, {{as well as the}} destruction of nesting habitat by inappropriate burning regimens.|$|E
50|$|Factors {{that impact}} {{communities}} in acid mine drainage sites vary temporarily and seasonally: temperature, rainfall, pH, <b>salinisation</b> and metal quantity all display {{variations on the}} long term, and can heavily affect communities. Changes in pH or temperature can affect metal solubility, and thereby the bioavailable quantity that directly impact organisms. Moreover, contamination persists over time: ninety years after a pyrite mine closure, water pH was still very low and microorganisms populations consisted mainly of acidophil bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Abiotic {{disorders}} can {{be caused}} by natural processes such as drought, frost, snow and hail; flooding and poor drainage; nutrient deficiency; deposition of mineral salts such as sodium chloride and gypsum; windburn and breakage by storms; and wildfires. Similar disorders (usually classed as abiotic) {{can be caused}} by human intervention, resulting in soil compaction, pollution of air and soil, <b>salinisation</b> caused by irrigation and road salting, over-application of herbicides, clumsy handling (e.g. lawnmower damage to trees), and vandalism.|$|E
50|$|The {{species has}} {{declined}} drastically during the 20th century and is rare throughout its range. Causes {{of the decline}} are ascribed to wetland drainage, river management and <b>salinisation,</b> as well as grazing and trampling of wetlands by stock.

The IUCN recently split the species and treats it as endangered.|$|E
5000|$|The lake, {{in large}} part, is a lagoon. With its geometry, {{the lake is}} {{expected}} to double in size and flood as global climate change affects the sea level.

50|$|Although {{nationwide}} {{the populations}} appear stable there are individual populations facing significant threat. Near threatened in Western Australia's wheat belt, urbanisation, <b>salinisation,</b> waterway degradation and pollution have all attributed to this status change. Northern Territory, Queensland,Tasmania and New South Wales they {{are classified as}} 'least concerned'. In the Victorian Lake Wellington, Lake Victoria and Lake Tyers region numbers have declined in {{the past fifty years}} attributed to commercial eel-fishing, predation, loss of habitat due to commercial development and poisoning from baiting programs placing this species at risk.|$|E
50|$|The ESBN is {{experiencing}} a surge in the demand for soil information in Europe, for addressing a number of environmental problems and questions. These include: leaching of agrochemicals, deposition of heavy metals, disposal of waste (agricultural, domestic and industrial), degradation of soil structure (through loss of soil organic matter, <b>salinisation</b> and subsoil compaction), risk of erosion (by water and wind), immobilisation of radionuclides, supply of water at catchment level, assessing the suitability (and sustainability) for traditional and alternative crops, and estimation of soil stability.|$|E

5000|$|A [...] "subtle synchrony" [...] is how Baskin (1997) {{describes}} {{the relationship that}} exists between the soil and the diversity of life, {{above and below the}} ground.
