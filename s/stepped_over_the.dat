5|$|United {{responded with}} their first {{extended}} period of possession of the half, working the ball into wide areas to be crossed into the middle, but Rooney's first couple of attempted centres were well cleared by Piqué. At the third attempt, though, Rooney's cross evaded the Barcelona defence as Touré kicked at thin air; however, it also failed to find a Manchester United player in the penalty area, both Ronaldo and Park going close. After Ronaldo was called offside in the 59thminute – despite appearing to be level with the last defender – Giggs stole the ball mid-way inside the Barcelona half before playing the ball to Ronaldo on the left wing. The Portuguese forward <b>stepped</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ball several times {{in an attempt to}} wrong-foot Puyol, before cutting inside and playing the ball across the edge of the area towards Carrick. A sliding challenge from Busquets prevented a shot, only for the English midfielder to slide the ball out for a Barcelona goal kick while attempting to play Rooney through. Rooney was again played down the right wing a few moments later, but his low cross was diverted behind by Piqué, and the resulting corner came to nothing. A left-wing attack from Ronaldo followed, but after cutting inside, he gave the ball away cheaply. Barcelona immediately went on the attack down the other end, but Henry was unable to get past O'Shea and his shot was well saved by Van der Sar low at the near post.|$|E

Hodge had actually completed the catch cleanly, before running over to the crowd to celebrate. Hodge denied the accusation and considered taking legal action. Cork was sanctioned by the ECB.|$|E

2500|$|Moments later, Frodo {{stood on}} the edge of the Crack of Doom, but was unwilling to destroy the Ring, {{claiming}} it for himself and putting it on. Gollum struck again, and struggled with the invisible Frodo. Finally, Gollum bit off Frodo's finger and seized the Ring. He gloated over his [...] "prize", dancing madly, but <b>stepped</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> edge and fell into the lava, taking the Ring with him with a last cry of [...] "Precious!" [...] Thus, the Ring was destroyed and Sauron defeated. Sam cursed Gollum after his death, but Frodo urged his friend to forgive him, as without him the quest would have failed and the War of the Ring would have been lost. Tolkien later wrote that it was direct intervention by Eru, Middle-earth's version of God, that led to Gollum's [...] "accident".|$|E

Two other cruisers volunteered to go on the call including Larry Minard and John Tess and Paul Rust. [...] A total of four cars carrying eight police officers arrived at 2867 Ohio Street. No neighbors corroborated the information that a woman had been dragged screaming into the vacant house. The caller had given a boarded up house as his address.

2500|$|Klebold {{walked down}} the steps toward the cafeteria. He came up to Kirklin, who was already wounded and lying on the ground, weakly calling for help. Klebold said, [...] "Sure. I'll help you," [...] then shot Kirklin in the face, {{critically}} wounding him. Daniel Rohrbough and Sean Graves had descended the staircase when Klebold and Harris' attention was diverted by the students on the grass; Graves—paralyzed beneath the waist—had crawled into {{the doorway of the}} cafeteria's west entrance and collapsed. Klebold shot Rohrbough, who was already fatally wounded by the shots previously fired by Harris, at close range through the upper left chest and then <b>stepped</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> injured Sean Graves to enter the cafeteria. Officials speculated that Klebold went to the cafeteria to check on the propane bombs. Harris shot down the steps at several students sitting near the cafeteria's entrance, severely wounding and partially paralyzing 17-year-old Anne-Marie Hochhalter as she tried to flee. Klebold came out of the cafeteria and went back up the stairs to join Harris.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} the train being pulled by Rocket {{approached}} on the other line. Rocket was being driven by Joseph Locke, George Stephenson's assistant and future eminent engineer in his own rights. A shout went up, [...] "An engine is approaching. Take care, gentlemen!" [...] The other disembarked passengers either climbed back into their seats, or <b>stepped</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> northern line and {{completely out of the}} way. A third option was available, to stand with your back to the stationary coaches, as there was a four-foot gap between the lines, and even though the Duke's private carriage was wider that then standard carriage, it would have still been possible to stand between the stationary and the travelling train and remain safe. However, what unfolded was a calamitous series of events. Huskisson was known to be clumsy. He had endured a long list of problems from his regular trips and falls, and he had twice broken his arm and never fully recovered the use of it. Add to this, that he was only a few weeks post surgery and was there against his doctor's advice.|$|E
2500|$|Newborns {{were held}} upside down by {{their feet and}} lifted up and down to prevent 'livergrown' disorder. Some {{midwives}} believed that placing the child next to the mother under the quilt would force 'bold hives' out of the baby's body. Others recommended a little catnip or ground ivy tea, a drop or two of turpentine, or a spoonful of whiskey in order to [...] "hive" [...] the baby. A piece of cloth was tied around the newborn's waist for six week to protect the navel area which was thought to easily rupture due to its weakness. The newborn’s hair could not be cut {{during the first few}} weeks of life for fear of death before six months of age. If a child whose hair was cut too early did not die, it was feared that the child would become a thief later in life. If someone <b>stepped</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> child, this would stunt the newborn’s growth. The day of the week on which the child was born also said a lot about the child. Children born on a Tuesday were said to be unlucky.|$|E

2500|$|Authors at Spirou {{could only}} {{go so far}} in expressing {{anything}} resembling politics within the magazine, and so the author of Gaston generally stuck to a gentle satire of productivity and authority. [...] However, the pacifism and concern for the environment that formed the basis of Franquin's politics and would be expressed much more bluntly in Idées noires were already surfacing in Gaston (and Spirou et Fantasio). [...] Very occasionally, Franquin <b>stepped</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> mark, as in an uncharacteristically angry strip where Gaston uses a toy Messerschmitt plane to strafe the whole office in protest at their (real life) appearance in the magazine's modelling column (while building the model, he says: “… and now, the swastikas. They are very popular amongst retards”). [...] Outside of Spirou however, Franquin had a free rein, and used Gaston in promotional material for diverse organisations such as Greenpeace and Amnesty International. In the former, activists scare whales away from whalers by plucking the dreaded gaffophone. [...] For the latter, Franquin produced a gut-wrenching sequence where Gaston is beaten and tortured and forced to watch M'oiselle Jeanne raped in front of him, before being sent to a prison camp. In the penultimate frame he faces capital punishment which the punters hope [...] "serves as an example". Awaking in a sweat, Gaston shouts at the reader that [...] "although this was a nightmare, it's happening right now around the world", urging membership.|$|E
