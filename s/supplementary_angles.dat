5000|$|Knowing two spreads {{allows the}} third to be {{calculated}} by solving the associated quadratic formula but, since two solutions are possible, further triangle spread rules must be used to select the appropriate one.

25|$|In {{rational}} geometry {{the spread}} between two lines is defined at {{the square of}} the sine of the angle between the lines.

5|$|When a {{wave train}} strikes a wall at an oblique angle, the {{reflected}} wave train departs at the <b>supplementary</b> <b>angle</b> causing a cross-hatched wave interference pattern {{known as the}} clapotis gaufré ("waffled clapotis"). In this situation, the individual crests formed {{at the intersection of}} the incident and reflected wave train crests move parallel to the structure.

5000|$|Unlike angle, {{which can}} define a {{relationship}} between rays emanating from a point, by a circular measure parametrization, and where a pair of lines can be considered four pairs of rays, forming four angles, 'spread' is more fundamental in rational trigonometry, describing two lines by a single measure of a rational function (see above). Being equivalent to the square of a sine of the corresponding angle [...] (and to the haversine of the chord-based double-angle [...] ), the spread of both an <b>angle</b> and its <b>supplementary</b> <b>angle</b> are equal.|$|R
5000|$|Breakover {{angle is}} the maximum {{possible}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>angle</b> (usually expressed in degrees) that a vehicle, {{with at least}} one forward wheel and one rear wheel, can drive over without the apex of that angle touching any point of the vehicle other than the wheels. This definition is contingent upon the wheels being in continuous contact with the supporting surface(s). Breakover angle may also be referred to as [...] "break-over angle" [...] or [...] "break over angle." [...] Breakover angle is different from ground clearance in that ground clearance is the shortest distance between the ground and lowest point on the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|In Euclidean geometry, an {{isosceles}} trapezoid (isosceles trapezium in British English) is a convex quadrilateral {{with a line}} of symmetry bisecting {{one pair}} of opposite sides. It is a special case of a trapezoid. In any isosceles trapezoid two opposite sides (the bases) are parallel, and the two other sides (the legs) are of equal length (properties shared with the parallelogram). The diagonals are also of equal length. The base angles of an isosceles trapezoid are equal in measure (there are in fact two pairs of equal base angles, where one base <b>angle</b> is the <b>supplementary</b> <b>angle</b> of a base angle at the other base).|$|R

2500|$|In Euclidean geometry, {{the sum of}} the {{exterior}} angles of a simple convex polygon will be one full turn (360°).

Both in this celestial coordinate system, {{and in the}} system to describe a nucleophile approaching a planar electrophile, the problem is to uniquely describe {{the location of a}} point off of a plane, relative to specific point on the plane. Hence, in both cases, the problem can be addressed using two angles, an altitude-type angle and an azimuth-type angle. Note, while elevation in celestial applications is most easily measured as the specific altitude shown, the elevation of the nucleophile, , is most easily measured as the <b>supplementary</b> <b>angle,</b> Nu-C-O, hence its values are most often >90° (see text and next image).|$|R
2500|$|Exterior angle – The {{exterior}} <b>angle</b> is the <b>supplementary</b> <b>angle</b> to {{the interior}} angle. Tracing around a convex n-gon, the angle [...] "turned" [...] at a corner is the exterior or external angle. Tracing {{all the way around}} the polygon makes one full turn, so the sum of the exterior angles must be 360°. This argument can be generalized to concave simple polygons, if external angles that turn in the opposite direction are subtracted from the total turned. Tracing around an n-gon in general, the sum of the exterior angles (the total amount one rotates at the vertices) can be any integer multiple d of 360°, e.g. 720° for a pentagram and 0° for an angular [...] "eight" [...] or antiparallelogram, where d is the density or starriness of the polygon. See also orbit (dynamics).|$|R

50|$|If {{a circle}} γ crosses circles α and β at equal angles, then γ is crossed {{orthogonal}}ly {{by one of}} the circles of antisimilitude of α and β; if γ crosses α and β in <b>supplementary</b> <b>angles,</b> it is crossed orthogonally by the other circle of antisimilitude, and if γ is orthogonal to both α and β then it is also orthogonal to both circles of antisimilitude.|$|E
50|$|Proof: Since angle BDA {{is a right}} angle, angle DBA equals π/2 minus angle DAB. However, angle DAH also equals π/2 minus angle DAB (since angle HAB is a right angle). Therefore triangles DBA and DAH are similar. Therefore angle DIA equals angle DOH, where I is the {{midpoint}} of BA and O is {{the midpoint}} of AH. But AOH is a straight line, so angle DOH and DOA are <b>supplementary</b> <b>angles.</b> Therefore the sum of angles DIA and DOA is π. Angle IAO is a right angle. The sum of the angles in any quadrilateral is 2π, so in quadrilateral IDOA, angle IDO must be a right angle. But ADHE is a rectangle, so the midpoint O of AH (the rectangle's diagonal) is also the midpoint of DE (the rectangle's other diagonal). As I (defined as the midpoint of BA) {{is the center of}} semicircle BA, and angle IDE is a right angle, then DE is tangent to semicircle BA at D. By analogous reasoning DE is tangent to semicircle AC at E. Q.E.D.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} find the {{shortest}} angular path between any two points, it is only necessary to search the set of border end points and the lines connecting mutually visible end points (calling them E-lines hereafter) (Fig. 4 b). For this purpose, Viraph creates a graph representing all E-lines (except for the lines connecting end points of the same border). Each E-line is recorded as two vectors of opposite directions (thus the graph has 2 n vertices, with n {{as the number of}} E-lines). Then, two databases are made: Table α that is a k[*]×[*] 2 n table (k is the number of grid cells) containing the <b>supplementary</b> <b>angle</b> made by any E[*]−[*]line vector and any grid cell[*],[*]and Table β[*],[*]a  2 n[*]×[*] 2 n table which contains the angular depth between all the E-line vectors. For Table β, the angles between the adjacent continuing vectors are calculated directly without pathfinding.|$|R
40|$|Morphological {{features}} of combination of bullet-type snow crystals replicated at Syowa Station, Antarctica are discussed from observations using a stereomicroscope. Some stereophotomicrographs {{of them are}} shown. The number of bullets forming the combination was counted. The bullets with five components were the most frequently observed. The maximum number of components was ten. The angles of their c-axes were measured, and found that about 70 °, 55 ° and 88 ° or their <b>supplementary</b> <b>angle</b> were predominant. In addition, 64 ° and 78 ° were found. These angles {{may be explained by}} the CSL theory by T. KOBAYASHI et al. (J. Cryst. Growth, 32, 233, 1976). Apparent pyramidal faces of bullet crystals are not the crystallographic pyramidal faces; { 1011 }, but are mere skeleton structures. These findings will be important for discussing the optical phenomena in the Antarctic atmosphere...|$|R
