25|$|Kim Delaney as Megan Donner; Horatio's first {{partner and}} a {{respected}} MDPD Police Lieutenant. She {{was the director}} of the MDPD Crime Lab prior to taking indefinite leave due to the death of her husband, who was killed in the line of duty. She believes in following the evidence, and as such is often seen as adversarial to Horatio's go-with-the-gut detective style. As a result of this, Megan resigns, finding the pressure of the job to now be more than <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle.</b> (season 1).|$|E
500|$|Ariana Grande {{performed}} the song at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards pre-show in medley with [...] "The Way". She sang {{only the first}} verse, chorus and bridge before moving into [...] "The Way". Caitlin White from MTV praised Grande's performance while commented that her [...] "stunning, unstoppable belt proved <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> the spotlight all on her own." [...] Grande also performed [...] "Baby I" [...] at the 2013 Worldwide Day of Play. In a video published in her YouTube channel, the singer performed an acoustic version of the song accompanied by musician Dan Kanter.

500|$|O'Reilly {{thought the}} {{development}} was interesting {{as the old}} Naomi would have teamed up with Dimato. Dimato later tried to bribe Naomi and Brennan encouraged {{her to go to}} the police, but she refused and gave the money back. Brennan confronted Dimato, who then cornered Naomi and threatened her for talking about the bribe. O'Reilly commented that Naomi was annoyed at Brennan's interference, as she felt <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> Dimato. She continued, [...] "She's tough as nails. She would never admit there is danger there – and especially not to Brennan!" [...] Matt Turner (Josef Brown) later asked for Naomi's help, so the police could build a case against Dimato. Naomi gave a statement even though she was still receiving threats from Dimato and his men. Dimato later targeted Sheila, forcing Naomi to retract her statement. Matt tried to get her to change her mind, but it was only when Sheila learned what she had done and told her to re-submit her statement, that Naomi agreed.|$|E

5000|$|In [...] "Graduation on Deck", {{the series}} finale, Maya joined the Peace Corps in Africa, {{and as a}} result, breaks up with Zack, because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>handle</b> a long-distance relationship. However, they still remain friends, and are shown hugging after graduation.|$|R
500|$|Code: Veronica {{producer}} Shinji Mikami said [...] "Claire {{became a}} lot tougher than I Imagined. I thought she should look the same, but the game director made her that way because she had such an experience in Resident Evil 2, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> any situation now!" [...] For Revelations 2, the now hardened and aggressive Claire was redesigned to be a contrasting character to the young, immature and easily scared Moira Burton, who {{was defined as a}} purely supporting character, and they both serve different roles in the story and have different functions. Producer Michiteru Okabe said: [...] "Really, only after did we look back and say, 'Oh, I guess they are both girls.' Which is good, because it means we’re treating them as whole characters and not just as their gender. What we settled on is the idea that you have different roles -- it isn’t two against the world, it’s one against the world with a helper." [...] Okabe also said the game's writer Dai Satō [...] "is a big fan of her personally" [...] {{which was one of the}} factors that led to Claire's return.|$|E
500|$|Bond next {{created the}} role of Mad Margaret in Ruddigore (1887; {{originally}} spelt [...] "Ruddygore"), which she regarded as her favourite of all the Gilbert and Sullivan roles, [...] "for it gave me the chance to show what I really could do as an actress." [...] The part was her largest to date, and Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte made her audition it {{for them to be}} sure that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> the responsibility. [...] "It was an awful ordeal. [...] I saw the three white faces looming out of the darkness as they sat close together; criticizing me, talking me over, with cold managerial detachment. It nearly killed me. [...] Perhaps it gave an added realism and abandon to my simulated madness, for indeed I was nearly mad with fear – but at any rate I came through triumphantly, they were all three of them delighted." [...] Bond was particularly nervous on opening night. [...] "I shook and tottered so much that Mad Margaret's staff was no mere adjunct, but an absolute necessity. Without it I should have fallen as I stood in the wings waiting to go on. Then some one gave me a push; I was there, on the stage, in the glare of the footlights, hundreds of eyes fixed on me, tier upon tier of dim white faces rising from floor to ceiling in the gloom. It was enough; I forgot myself, I was Mad Margaret and no one else. I made an immense success." [...] Cellier and Bridgeman seconded this assessment: ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{one writer}} {{described}} {{the effect of}} McCalla's signature character on girls growing up in that era, [...] "Sheena was the only female portrayed on the tube who didn't conform to the fifties stereotype. Sheena was a real rugged individualist. Watching her struggle with a new adventure every week made me feel more capable {{at a time when}} everything was so unexplored. If <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> the jungle, I felt sure that I could handle my world".|$|E
50|$|Amamiya is {{innocent}} {{when it comes}} to love. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>handle</b> her feelings for Yoshina and locked them away in her split personality. When Abyss surfaced and proclaimed her love to Yoshina, Amamiya once again becomes aware of her feelings. When Amamiya confronts Yoshina about what Abyss said, they almost kiss, but are interrupted by the kids.|$|R
50|$|Climax: Amy and Esme {{come to a}} great conflict, where Amy {{admits that}} she distanced herself because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>handle</b> her mother being right about Dominic in some respects, but is still infuriated {{by the fact that}} her own mother - who loves her {{daughter}} unconditionally - could not understand Amy's unconditional love for Dominic.|$|R
5000|$|The Hiyu {{worked the}} short route between Vashon Island and Tacoma until the late-1980s. By then, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> no longer <b>handle</b> the {{increased}} {{traffic on the}} route and was replaced with the 55-car [...]|$|R
2500|$|Rusty stated to {{the media}} he was never told by psychiatrists {{that his wife was}} {{psychotic}} nor that she could harm the children, and that, had he known otherwise, he would have never had more children. [...] "'If I'd known she was psychotic, we'd never have even considered having more kids', he told the Dallas Observer". However, she revealed to her prison psychiatrist, Dr. Melissa Ferguson, that prior to their last child, [...] "she had told Rusty that {{she did not want to}} have sex because Dr. Starbranch had said she might hurt her children." [...] Rusty, she said, simply asserted his procreative religious beliefs, complimented her as a good mother, and persuaded her that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> more children.|$|E
2500|$|When Gleason {{moved to}} CBS, Kelton was left behind; her {{name had been}} {{published}} in Red Channels, a book that listed and described reputed communists (and communist sympathizers) in television and radio, and the network {{did not want to}} hire her. Gleason reluctantly let her leave the cast, with a cover story for the media that she had [...] "heart trouble". At first he turned down Meadows as Kelton's replacement. Meadows wrote in her memoir that she slipped back to audition again and frumped herself up to convince Gleason that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> the role of a frustrated (but loving) working-class wife. Rounding out the cast, Joyce Randolph played Trixie, Ed Norton's wife. Elaine Stritch had played the role as a tall and attractive blonde in the first sketch, but was quickly replaced by Randolph. Comedy writer Leonard Stern always felt The Honeymooners was more than sketch material and persuaded Gleason to make it into a full hour-long episode.|$|E

5000|$|The group parted ways in 2003 due to Liesching's {{engagement}} to Christian artist, Jeremy Camp. It was noted that Liesching felt that {{with her new}} family starting, that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>handle</b> the duties required of her both as a musician and as a wife. Since then Liesching has married Camp and they have two daughters, born in 2004 and 2006. She has also released two solo albums as [...] "Adie".|$|R
5000|$|In {{reference}} to her lifelong disability, Thom Gunn recollected that “The unavoidable first fact about Josephine Miles was physical. As {{a young child}} she contracted a form of degenerative arthritis so severe that it left her limbs deformed and crippled. As a result, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not be left alone in a house, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>handle</b> a mug...she <b>could</b> not use a typewriter; and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> neither walk nor operate a wheelchair.” [...] Miles bequeathed her Berkeley home to the University of California, which offers the house {{for use by the}} visiting Roberta C. Holloway Lecturer in the Practice of Poetry.|$|R
50|$|Parish flew a pink P-40 Warhawk {{in several}} air shows for over 25 years, until she reached her 70s. Deciding that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> no longer <b>handle</b> the G-forces, she flew that plane last in October, 1993. She {{continued}} to fly her Beechcraft Beechcraft T-34 Mentor.|$|R

[...] "It's curious, but while <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> mutinous pupils and bluff the managers, she quakes if a door rattles on a windy night. One's rather safer in our {{homestead}} than a Montreal hotel; but Mabel {{has lived in the}} cities and the Wild West tradition dies hard. As a matter of fact, there never was a Wild West in Canada." [...] He opened the pistol. [...] "You put the cartridge shells in like this--" ...|$|E
60|$|There was to his {{companion}} something really unfathomable {{in this little}} American doctor whom she had taken up on grounds of large policy and who, though he was assumed to have sunk the medical character, was neither handsome nor distinguished, but only immensely rich and quite original—since he wasn’t strictly insignificant. It was unfathomable to begin with that a medical man should be so rich, or that so rich a man should be medical; it was even, to an eye always gratified by suitability and, for that matter, almost everywhere recognising it, rather irritating. Jackson Lemon himself could have explained the anomaly better than any one else, but this was an explanation one could scarcely ask for. There were other things: his cool acceptance of certain situations; his general indisposition to make comprehension easy, let alone to guess it, with all his guessing, so much hindered; his way of taking refuge in jokes which at times had not even the merit of being American; his way too of appearing to be a suitor without being an aspirant. Lady Beauchemin, however, was, like her puzzling friend himself, prepared to run a certain risk. His reserves made him slippery, {{but that was only}} when one pressed. She flattered herself <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> people lightly. “My father will be sure to act with perfect tact,” she said; “though of course if you shouldn’t care to be questioned you can go out of town.” She had the air of really wishing to act with the most natural delicacy.|$|E
6000|$|Our {{young lady}} {{had not taken}} up the charge, had dealt with it good-humouredly, just because she knew so well what to think of it. It was at once {{one of her most}} {{cherished}} complaints and most secret supports that people didn't understand her, and it was accordingly a matter of indifference to her that Mrs. Jordan shouldn't; even though Mrs. Jordan, handed down from their early twilight of gentility and also the victim of reverses, was the only member of her circle in whom she recognised an equal. She was perfectly aware that her imaginative life was the life in which she spent most of her time; and she would have been ready, had it been at all worth while, to contend that, since her outward occupation didn't kill it, it must be strong indeed. Combinations of flowers and green-stuff, forsooth! What <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> freely, she said to herself, was combinations of men and women. The only weakness in her faculty came from the positive abundance of her contact with the human herd; this was so constant, it had so the effect of cheapening her privilege, that there were long stretches in which inspiration, divination and interest quite dropped. The great thing was the flashes, the quick revivals, absolute accidents all, and neither to be counted on nor to be resisted. Some one had only sometimes to put in a penny for a stamp and the whole thing was upon her. She was so absurdly constructed that these were literally the moments that made up--made up for the long stiffness of sitting there in the stocks, made up for the cunning hostility of Mr. Buckton and the importunate sympathy of the counter-clerk, made up for the daily deadly flourishy letter from Mr. Mudge, made up even for the most haunting of her worries, the rage at moments of not knowing how her mother did [...] "get it." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{story from}} her time playing in New York clubs is that drummer Art Blakey asked her {{play with his}} band one night, but [...] "she refused, saying she was drunk, and anyway did not think she was good enough. Blakey dragged her to the piano, and started playing at a furious tempo which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>handle.</b> Blakey then {{addressed}} the audience: 'Now you see why we don't want these Europeans coming over here and taking our jobs!'" ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the review}} of Summit's performance, Lindsay came under fire for being {{ineffective}} in all three tasks, to which she shocked everyone by openly admitting <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>handle</b> the competition, {{and that she was}} out of her depth. With some sympathy, Lord Sugar quickly fired her as a direct result, leaving Nurun to be scrutinised over her performance; after Lindsay, she became the team's next worst seller, despite having previous experience operating a market stall.|$|R
50|$|She {{divorced}} {{her husband}} when her daughters {{were still in}} elementary school because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>handle</b> the {{long period of time}} in which he was away. When she remarried, she let Yuu and Tsukasa live with the Tadanos so as to not cause conflict with her new family. After taking Yuu and Tsukasa back, she reconciles with her second husband as her stepson has moved out of the house; she and Tsukasa relocate with her husband to the United States.|$|R
50|$|Marina Hurley, {{a leading}} {{researcher}} of stinging trees, found {{the only way}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> the plant to study it was with heavy welding gloves.|$|E
5000|$|Her {{plan was}} simple-minded: she visited all hotels and motels {{in the area}} to fight anybody listed under the name [...] "Smith". After attacking a few innocents, Maxine met with Samuel Smith, whose superhuman powers {{turned out to be more}} than <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle.</b> The damage was so great that she was deactivated.|$|E
5000|$|Mac {{tried to}} look out for Felicia by warning her against a {{relationship}} with Roy DiLucca, who had recently made moves towards becoming a mobster. She asked Mac to help her trace a briefcase full of cash which had shown up in Roy's apartment. She also told Mac <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> things with Roy.|$|E
50|$|Initially Lyudmila Gurchenko was {{rejected}} {{for the role}} of Lena Krylova by director Eldar Ryazanov and the artist council. Another actress was hired, however <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>handle</b> the part. Then Ryazanov came to Pyryev with the appeal to hire a new actress, adding that anyone but Gurchenko should be signed up {{for the role of}} Krylova. But when Pyryev later saw Gurchenko in the Mosfilm corridor, he decided that there was something special about her. Pyryev brought her to the set and announced that she will act in the film.|$|R
60|$|I {{felt certain}} an enemy's boat was approaching, because had any one {{living on the}} river been coming up {{at that time of}} night, paddles would have been used instead of oars. I knew of no one nearabout Benedict who would have rowed a boat against the current when <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have been <b>handled</b> so much more readily the other way.|$|R
5000|$|Betty tells Tom <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have <b>handled</b> the {{situation}} herself {{and she still}} {{has no interest in}} marrying him and wished he had not come. Another passenger tells Betty that Finsch's pride has been wounded and he will get revenge on Tom somehow. That night, Tom goes missing and a typewritten suicide note is found. There are suspicions, but no proof. When another [...] "suicide" [...] involving Finsch and the wife of a shipping agent leaves no doubt in Betty's mind that Finsch is a murderer, the two are pitted against one another, with Finsch seemingly holding all the cards.|$|R
50|$|The pipes are a syrinx of {{functions}} {{identical to those}} of the bells, designed for the Abhorsen-in-Waiting to use until proficient. Lirael gains them in the eponymous book, but gives them to Sameth after realizing that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> the bells and he could not. At the binding of Orannis, Sameth uses the pipes to create Lirael's sword.|$|E
50|$|Roosevelts {{generally}} poor condition {{weighed against}} retaining {{her in the}} reserve fleet. Moreover, her low hangar height of 17 ft limited the aircraft types that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle.</b> It was reasoned that existing s could handle {{the same types of}} aircraft at lower cost. Some admirals also feared that if Roosevelt were retained, the Carter Administration would use her reactivation as a reason to cancel future Nimitz-class carriers.|$|E
50|$|By 1938, Garner {{had made}} her first film appearance, {{and over the next}} few years she {{appeared}} in several more films, including Jane Eyre (1943) and The Keys of the Kingdom (1944). She reached the height of her success at the age of 13 in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945), winning an Academy Juvenile Award largely for this performance. In the same year she showed <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> comedy by giving a fine performance in Junior Miss (1945).|$|E
500|$|When {{writing the}} novel, Chase {{knew that her}} female protagonist had to {{be strong enough to}} equal Dain's {{forceful}} personality. Chase admits that because the novel is set in the period leading up to the Victorian era, a woman like Jessica could not have dealt with Dain, writing that [...] "if Jessica were like what we assume to be the typical young lady of her time, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never <b>handle</b> Dain, and he’d think her too boring to live". Chase instead modeled Jessica after the type of women who lived a few generations previously and who had [...] "a more practical, frank attitude toward sex".|$|R
50|$|Despite {{winning an}} {{advantage}} in the final Immunity Challenge, Malcolm failed to win immunity and he was subsequently voted out for being the largest threat against the jury. All three finalists were berated by the jury at the Final Tribal Council; Lisa for claiming that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>handle</b> {{the pressures of the}} game, Michael for being strategically and socially inept, and Denise for being condescending at times. However, Denise's argument, coupled with {{the fact that she was}} the first player in Survivor history to attend and survive every Tribal Council in the game proved to be the most effective when she earned the title of Sole Survivor by a 6-1-1 vote.|$|R
50|$|Maya Anne Ford, {{was born}} on January 8, 1979 in Oakland, California, {{on the same day}} as her fellow band member Torry Castellano. She met future bandmates Tory Castellano, Brett Anderson and Allison Robertson in junior high school. They formed a band in 8th grade called Ragady Anne, later calling {{themselves}} The Electrocutes at Palo Alto High School. Ford started to play the bass guitar at age 13. Initially she was playing guitar (she received an acoustic guitar from her cousin), but then she decided to switch to the bass, because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>handle</b> the chords. When her band (then known as Screen) started in May 1993, she had had approximately six months of playing experience.|$|R
