40|$|Most {{data used}} to assess the {{distribution}} and abundance of whales are derived from <b>scientific</b> <b>surveys</b> that are <b>designed</b> carefully to minimize sources of variation and reduce the potential for bias. Gathering data in this fashion tends to be both time consuming and costly. Similar data, however, can be collected from platforms of opportunity, including commercial vessels, ecotourism operations and whale watch vessels. The goal of the current project was to make recommendations for data collection procedures aboard whale watch vessels so that such observations are as comparable as possible to data collected from <b>scientific</b> <b>surveys.</b> To accomplish this goal, a sightings data set was obtained from three whale watch companies on Stellwagen Bank, Massachusetts during summer 2007. Vessel and sightings data were obtained via GPS for the duration of whale watches out of Gloucester and Boston, Massachusetts. Whale sightings data were combined with vessel trackline data to calculate species-specific sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE). These SPUE values were then compared to similar data derived from <b>scientific</b> <b>surveys</b> conducted in the same area. Additionally, sightings data from whale watches from 1994 - 2006 were analyzed for long-term trends in abundance and distribution. Whale watc...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{historical}} overview of social surveys and describe {{the historical development of}} <b>scientific</b> <b>survey</b> methodology and survey statistics. The origins of survey research {{can be traced back to}} the early 19 th century and the first scientiflc survey was conducted in England in 1912 by Bowley. Modem survey methods have their roots in the 1930 �s, when three major aspects of the survey process were developed and refined: sampling techniques, data collection techniques, and statistical methods for data analysis. In the fifties, the scientific face-to-face interview was established, and handbooks were published. In the early seventies, telephone interviewing was introduced and mailsurvey methods were updated and refined. This was followed by the development of computer-assisted interviewing and electronic surveys in the eighties and nineties. At the same time, more emphasis was given to concepts such as measurement error, nonresponse. and total quality control. We are now at the brink of a new millennium. Although the basic principles of the <b>scientific</b> <b>survey</b> still hold. survey statisticians from the last millennium, like Bowley, would be surprised to see the <b>design</b> of a <b>survey</b> in 2012. Undoubtedly, this design will incorporate new technologies and will focus on reducing the respondent�s burden, while improving data quality. Bowley would certainly be pleased to see that sophisticated methods for the reduction of nonresponse and measurement error have been incorporated in a total quality <b>survey</b> <b>design!.</b> © 1999, Sage Publications.

40|$|Vegetation {{maps are}} {{critical}} biodiversity planning instruments, but {{the classification of}} vegetation for mapping can be strongly biased by <b>survey</b> <b>design.</b> Standardization of <b>survey</b> <b>design</b> across different vegetation types is therefore increasingly recommended for vegetation mapping programs. However, some vegetation types have complex small-scale vegetation patterns {{that are important in}} characterizing these vegetation types, and standard designs will often not capture these patterns. The objective of this paper was to investigate the magnitude of potential map bias that results from <b>survey</b> <b>design</b> standardization and recommend approaches to deal with this bias. We surveyed upland swamps of the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area Australia using two contrasting <b>survey</b> <b>designs,</b> including the standard 400 [*]m 2 single quadrat design recommended and used by authorities. We then derived a classification for these swamps and tested the effect of <b>survey</b> <b>design</b> on this classification, species richness and the type of species detected (obligate or facultative swamp species). Species richness and species type were not significantly different among survey techniques. However, more than 40 % of swamps clustered differently among <b>survey</b> <b>designs.</b> Thus, one of the 10 derived communities (which is floristically consistent with a previously mapped endangered community) was indistinct, and some individual swamps misclassified using the standard <b>survey</b> <b>design.</b> An effect of landscape position on swamp floristic patterns and a significant trend for high similarity scores among swamps surveyed with multiple small quadrats compared to the standard <b>survey</b> <b>design</b> was also determined. Australian upland swamps are classified at the global scale as shrub-dominated wetlands, and complex floristic patterns have been recorded in shrub-dominated wetlands in both northern and southern hemispheres. We therefore advocate either multiple <b>survey</b> <b>designs</b> or different <b>survey</b> standards for upland swamp communities and other vegetation types that have complex floristic patterns at small scales...|$|R
