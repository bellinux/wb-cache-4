25|$|Si–O {{bonds are}} much {{stronger}} (809 kJ/mol compared to 538 kJ/mol) than a typical C–O <b>single</b> <b>bond.</b> The favorable formation of Si–O bonds drives many organic reactions {{such as the}} Brook rearrangement and Peterson olefination. Compared to the strong Si–O bond, the Si–F bond is even stronger.|$|E
50|$|Polyenes are poly-unsaturated organic {{compounds}} that contain {{at least three}} alternating double and <b>single</b> carbon-carbon <b>bonds.</b> These carbon-carbon double bonds interact in {{a process known as}} conjugation.

50|$|Triphenylene is a fully benzenoid PAH, meaning its {{structure}} is composed only of full benzene rings interconnected by carbon-carbon <b>single</b> <b>bonds.</b> The three benzene rings {{can be drawn}} as the three outer rings, with the central ring formed by one face of each and the three carbon-carbon <b>single</b> <b>bonds.</b>|$|R
25|$|In a cyclic {{molecule}} {{with three}} alternating double bonds, cyclohexatriene, the bond {{length of the}} <b>single</b> <b>bond</b> would be 1.54Å {{and that of the}} double bond would be 1.34Å.

25|$|Borazine is isostructural with benzene. The six B-N bonds have {{length of}} 1.436Å. The carbon–carbon bond in benzene is shorter length at 1.397Å. The boron–nitrogen bond length is between {{that of the}} boron–nitrogen <b>single</b> <b>bond</b> with 0.151nm and the boron–nitrogen double bond which is 0.131nm. This {{suggests}} partial delocalisation of nitrogen lone-pair electrons.|$|E

5000|$|In organic chemistry, a {{saturated}} compound is a hydrocarbon {{which has}} no double or triple bonds. For example, consider three similar organic compounds that are progressively less saturated: ethane, ethylene, and acetylene (ethyne). Ethane, a completely saturated compound, has only <b>single</b> <b>bonds</b> between its hydrogen and carbon atoms (C2H6). Ethylene, an unsaturated compound of ethane, has a carbon double bond, having lost two hydrogen <b>single</b> <b>bonds</b> (C2H4). Finally acetylene, the completely unsaturated compound of ethane, has a carbon triple bond, having lost an additional pair of hydrogen <b>single</b> <b>bonds</b> (C2H2).|$|R

25|$|Different routes {{have been}} {{developed}} over the years; the key step {{is the creation of}} the nitrogen-nitrogen <b>single</b> <b>bond.</b> In the Olin Raschig process, chlorine-based oxidants oxidize ammonia without the presence of a ketone. In the peroxide process, hydrogen peroxide oxidizes ammonia {{in the presence of a}} ketone. Instead of carbon-nitrogen double bond in imine, urea provides amine groups bonded to carbonyl for oxidation.|$|E
25|$|Like {{a single}} {{covalent}} bond, double bonds {{can be described}} in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals, except that, unlike a <b>single</b> <b>bond</b> (which consists of a single sigma bond), a carbon–carbon double bond consists of one sigma bond and one pi bond. This double bond is stronger than a single covalent bond (611kJ/mol for C=C vs. 347kJ/mol for C–C) and also shorter, with an average bond length of 1.33 ångströms (133 pm).|$|E
25|$|Atomic orbitals (except for s orbitals) have {{specific}} directional properties leading to {{different types of}} covalent bonds. Sigma (σ) bonds are the strongest covalent bonds and are due to head-on overlapping of orbitals on two different atoms. A <b>single</b> <b>bond</b> is usually a σ bond. Pi (π) bonds are weaker and are due to lateral overlap between p (or d) orbitals. A double bond between two given atoms consists of one σ and one π bond, and a triple bond is one σ and two π bonds.|$|E

25|$|In this route, {{hydrazine}} {{is produced}} in several steps from ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, and a ketone such as acetone or methylethyl ketone. The ketone and ammonia first condense to give the imine, which is oxidised by hydrogen peroxide to the oxaziridine, a three-membered ring containing carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. Next, the oxaziridine gives the hydrazone by treatment with ammonia, which process creates the nitrogen-nitrogen <b>single</b> <b>bond.</b> This hydrazone condenses with one more equivalent of ketone; the resulting azine is hydrolyzed to give hydrazine and regenerate the ketone. Unlike the Olin Raschig Process, this approach does not produce a salt as a by-product.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{cracking}} was {{the first}} category of hydrocarbon cracking to be developed. Thermal cracking {{is an example of}} a reaction whose energetics are dominated by entropy (∆S°) rather than by enthalpy (∆H°) in the Gibbs Free Energy equation ∆G°=∆H°-T∆S°. Although the bond dissociation energy D for a carbon-carbon <b>single</b> <b>bond</b> is relatively high (about 375 kJ/mol) and cracking is highly endothermic, the large positive entropy change resulting from the fragmentation of one large molecule into several smaller pieces, together with the extremely high temperature, makes T∆S° term larger than the ∆H° term, thereby favoring the cracking reaction.|$|E
25|$|Aldehydes feature an sp2-hybridized, planar carbon {{center that}} is {{connected}} by a double bond to oxygen and a <b>single</b> <b>bond</b> to hydrogen. The C–H bond is not ordinarily acidic. Because of resonance stabilization of the conjugate base, an α-hydrogen in an aldehyde (not shown in the picture above) is far more acidic, with a pKa near 17, compared to the acidity of a typical alkane (pKa about 50). This acidification is attributed to (i) the electron-withdrawing quality of the formyl center and (ii) {{the fact that the}} conjugate base, an enolate anion, delocalizes its negative charge. Related to (i), the aldehyde group is somewhat polar.|$|E

25|$|Since {{fluorine}} is {{a relatively}} small atom with a large electronegativity, its covalent radius is difficult to evaluate. The covalent radius is defined as half the bond lengths between two neutral atoms {{of the same kind}} connected with a <b>single</b> <b>bond.</b> By this definition, the covalent radius of F is 71pm. However, the F-F bond in F2 is abnormally weak and long. Besides, almost all bonds to fluorine are highly polar because of its large electronegativity, so the use of a covalent radius to predict the length of such a bond is inadequate and the bond lengths calculated from these radii are almost always longer than the experimental values.|$|E
25|$|Polymerization of alkenes is a {{reaction}} that yields polymers of high industrial value at great economy, {{such as the}} plastics polyethylene and polypropylene. Polymers from alkene monomers are referred to {{in a general way}} as polyolefins or in rare instances as polyalkenes. A polymer from alpha-olefins is called a polyalphaolefin (PAO). Polymerization can proceed via either a free-radical or an ionic mechanism, converting the double to a <b>single</b> <b>bond</b> and forming single bonds to join the other monomers. Polymerization of conjugated dienes such as buta-1,3-diene or isoprene (2-methylbuta-1,3-diene) results in largely 1,4-addition with possibly some 1,2-addition of the diene monomer to a growing polymer chain.|$|E
25|$|Ethane {{forms the}} {{simplest}} case {{for studying the}} conformation of alkanes, as {{there is only one}} C–C bond. If one looks down the axis of the C–C bond, one will see the so-called Newman projection. The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120° between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However, the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360°. This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon–carbon <b>single</b> <b>bond.</b> Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important: eclipsed conformation and staggered conformation.|$|E
50|$|Sulfur's {{oxidation}} {{states are}} −2, +2, +4, and +6. Sulfur-containing analogs of oxygen compounds often have the prefix thio-. Sulfur's chemistry {{is similar to}} oxygen's, in many ways. One difference is that sulfur-sulfur double bonds are far weaker than oxygen-oxygen double <b>bonds,</b> but sulfur-sulfur <b>single</b> <b>bonds</b> are stronger than oxygen-oxygen <b>single</b> <b>bonds.</b> Organic sulfur compounds such as thiols have a strong specific smell, and a few are utilized by some organisms.|$|R
50|$|<b>Single</b> <b>bonding</b> even {{appears in}} {{molecules}} {{as complex as}} hydrocarbons larger than methane. The type of covalent bonding in hydrocarbons is extremely important in the nomenclature of these molecules. Hydrocarbons containing only <b>single</b> <b>bonds</b> {{are referred to as}} alkanes (Moore, Stanitski, and Jurs 334). The names of specific molecules which belong to this group end with the suffix -ane' Examples include ethane, 2-methylbutane, and cyclopentane (Moore, Stanitski, and Jurs 335).|$|R
