5|$|The creek's use as {{a tribal}} {{boundary}} is disputed. As other southern California Native Americans have done, a tribe typically claimed both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stream or river—and used drainage divides as boundaries instead. However, the presence of Aliso Canyon, a steep and difficult-to-traverse gorge, suggests the opposite. Kroeber (1907) {{was the first to}} support this theory, and many other archaeologists have followed as well. The Juaneño disagree, arguing that their boundary stretches north to the northern drainage divide of the Aliso Creek watershed, which supports the practice of claiming both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stream.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{the whole}} video set {{is made in}} {{tropical}} and romantic setting. The video begins with a shot of Rihanna herself laying down in grass. Then scenes of Rihanna walking {{on the beach and}} Rihanna curling up on the chair are shown. This is followed by her own and her partner holding each other closely in bed, sitting on different <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large bed, and other scenes featuring Rihanna singing through sheer curtains and drapery. In the video there are also black-white scenes showing Rihanna touching to a stone wall.|$|E
5|$|Because {{these three}} surface {{energies}} form the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> triangle, they are {{constrained by the}} triangle inequalities, γij < γjk + γik meaning that no one of the surface tensions can exceed {{the sum of the}} other two. If three fluids with surface energies that do not follow these inequalities are brought into contact, no equilibrium configuration consistent with Figure 3 will exist.|$|E
5|$|Fez (stylized as FEZ) is an indie puzzle-platform {{video game}} {{developed}} by Polytron Corporation {{and published by}} Trapdoor. The player-character Gomez receives a fez that reveals his two-dimensional (2D) world {{to be one of}} four <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> three-dimensional (3D) world. The player rotates between these four 2D views to realign platforms and solve the game's puzzles. The object of the game is to collect cubes and cube fragments to restore order to the universe.|$|E

5|$|For the Royal Air Force, Proud had caves {{dug into}} the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wadi to hide two of the Hurricanes. The third was hidden in a hole beside the runway, the same shape as the {{aircraft}}, and covered by a lid and some tents. Dummy aircraft and hangars were constructed to draw fire; these were marked as real on marked-up air photographs captured with a Luftwaffe airman. The aircraft all survived the siege, important both for air defence and for maintaining {{the morale of the}} defending troops.|$|E
5|$|Generally all <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stela were sculpted {{with human}} figures and hieroglyphic text, with each side forming {{a part of}} a single composition. Undecorated stelae in the form of plain slabs or columns of stone are found {{throughout}} the Maya region. These appear never to have been painted or to have been decorated with overlaid stucco sculpture.|$|E
5|$|The concept behind {{diffused}} lighting camouflage was to project light {{on to the}} <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship {{so as to make}} its brightness match its background. For this purpose, projectors were mounted on temporary supports attached to the hull. The prototype was developed to include automatic control of brightness using a photocell. The prototyped concept was never put into production, though the Canadian prototypes did briefly see active service. The Canadian ideas were, however, adapted by the US Air Force in its Yehudi lights project.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>of</b> the 2010 U.S. census, this places roughly 154.4 million Americans {{living on}} each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{longitude}} line {{passing through a}} location in Pike County, Indiana, and the same number living on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> latitude line through the same point.|$|R

5|$|The {{influence}} of more radical Expressionism and Modernism {{can be seen}} in buildings such as Basil Spence's Mortonhall Crematorium, Edinburgh (1964–67), with a series of irregular chapels, with smooth-faced blockwork and Wheeler & Sproson's Boghall Church, Bathgate (1965), influenced by Beaux-Arts architecture. The pioneering contribution from the Church of Scotland was St. Columbia's, Glenrothes (1960), which had seating for the congregation on three <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> central platform, with the choir and elders on the fourth side behind the pulpit.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey L-shaped {{main house}} forms {{the east and}} south <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{courtyard}} with single-storey stables forming {{the north and west}} sides.

5|$|These ore bodies {{formed in}} {{different}} places along a ring fault in the caldera. About 50 million years after they were deposited, the tectonic plate of which they were a part collided with another small plate {{and then with the}} proto-North American continent. The collisions, which welded the plates to the continent, folded the Cleopatra tuff {{in such a way that}} the two ore bodies ended up on opposite <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fold called the Jerome anticline.|$|E

Their mutual lover, Dina, is suspended above a third saw. As the scene draws attention and police arrive, a puppet informs the men that they can kill each other or let Dina die. They initially fight each other, during which Brad is cut, but ultimately choose to allow Dina to die instead.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} Korean rural folk traditions, {{the sport is}} {{regarded}} as a predictor of future events, specifically harvests. The outcome of a ritualised contest between the two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> village (East and West) was seen as an indicator of the abundance (or otherwise) of that year's rice crop, which would be harvested in the autumn; as a result, juldarigi and similar folk sports are predominant in the rice-growing areas of the South. This is due to the common association in Southeast Asia between dragons (which the ropes of the juldarigi are thought to resemble) and rain; as a result juldarigi or similar tug-of-war ceremonies have also historically been staged during periods of drought. The connection of the two ropes used (with one rope's smaller loop being placed through the other's larger loop) is reminiscent of sexual intercourse, which also gives rise to the sport's association with fecundity.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in April, {{while on}} NXT Redemption, Natalya became allied with former Hart Dynasty partner Tyson Kidd again, and started feuding with former protégé Kaitlyn {{when she felt}} Kaitlyn was paying Kidd too much attention. The pair faced off in both singles and tag team {{competition}} throughout mid-2012, including being on opposite <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> six-Diva tag team match at Money in the Bank, which Natalya's team lost. Their feud ended on August 31, when Natalya lost to Kaitlyn in a singles match on SmackDown. In November, Natalya began an on-screen relationship with The Great Khali. The following month, Natalya saved Hornswoggle from an attack by Rosa Mendes, thus turning face in the process. This led to a feud with Natalya, Khali, and Hornswoggle facing off against Mendes and her allies, Primo and Epico in mixed tag team matches in early 2013. On the March 27 episode of NXT, Natalya lost a Divas Championship match to champion Kaitlyn.|$|E

5|$|Deep frying (also {{referred}} to as deep fat frying) is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat, most commonly oil, rather than the shallow oil used in conventional frying, done in a frying pan. Normally, a deep fryer or chip pan is used for this; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used. Deep frying may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot. Deep frying is classified as hot-fat cooking method. Typically, deep frying foods cook quickly: all <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> food are cooked simultaneously as oil has {{a high rate of}} heat conduction.|$|E
5|$|Derby Place was {{situated}} in the parish of St Benedict and St Peter, south of St Paul's Cathedral, more or less on the College's present location. There are records of the heralds carrying out modifications {{to the structure of}} Derby Place over many years. However, little record of its appearance has survived, except the description that the buildings formed three <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quadrangle, entered through a gate with a portcullis on the west side. On the south range, roughly where Queen Victoria Street now stands, was a large hall on the western end. Derby Place's hearth tax bill from 1663, discovered in 2009 at the National Archives at Kew, showed that the building had about thirty-two rooms, which were the workplace as well as the home to eleven officers of arms.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{forces were}} first quantitatively {{investigated}} in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out. Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities: they have magnitude and direction. When two forces act {{on a point}} particle, the resulting force, the resultant (also called the net force), can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition: the addition of two vectors represented by <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram. The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action. However, if the forces are acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on {{the motion of the}} body.|$|E
