40|$|The {{design of}} {{hot-rolled}} steel portal frames can {{be sensitive to}} <b>serviceability</b> <b>deflection</b> limits. In such cases, {{in order to reduce}} frame deflections, practitioners increase the size of the eaves haunch and / or the sizes of the steel sections used for the column and rafter members of the frame. This paper investigates the effect of such deflection limits using a real-coded niching genetic algorithm (RC-NGA) that optimizes frame weight, taking into account both ultimate as well as serviceability limit states. The results show that the proposed GA is efficient and reliable. Two different sets of <b>serviceability</b> <b>deflection</b> limits are then considered: deflection limits recommended by the Steel Construction Institute (SCI), which is based on control of differential deflections, and other deflection limits based on suggestions by industry. Parametric studies are carried out on frames with spans ranging between 15 m to 50 m and column heights between 5 m to 10 m. It is demonstrated that for a 50 m span frame, use of the SCI recommended deflection limits can lead to frame weights that are around twice as heavy as compared to designs without these limits...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the design optimization of single-storey steel portal frame buildings. In the UK, such buildings account for 90 % of all single-storey buildings and 50 % of all constructional steelwork used. Two different types of steel portal frames are considered: conventional hot-rolled steel portal frames, which can achieve spans of up to 50 m, and cold-formed steel frames, which while less popular in the UK, may be more efficient for spans around 12 m. A real-coded niching genetic algorithm is used {{for the purposes of the}} design optimization. By adopting a niching strategy, the diversity of the population is effectively maintained and so increases the probability in searching for the optimum solution in the design space. The efficiency of the real-coded niching genetic algorithm is demonstrated through design examples of both hot-rolled steel and cold-formed steel portal frames. For the design optimization of hot-rolled steel portal frames, the optimization algorithm is used to minimize the material cost of the portal frame, per square m on plan, taking into account both the hot-rolled steel cross-sections and the eaves haunch size. In all cases, a frame spacing of 6 m is adopted. Both ultimate and serviceability limit states are considered, with deflection limits recommended by the Steel Construction Institute. It is shown that <b>serviceability</b> <b>deflections</b> govern for the design of a 50 m span portal frame, where material costs increase by 60 % compared to an ultimate limit state design only. For small span frame, i. e., span of 10 m, material cost only increases by 19 %. For the design optimization of the cold-formed steel portal frame, the same algorithm is applied to minimize the material cost of the main frame members. In addition, frame spacings of both 4 m and 6 m are considered. For the case of a 12 m span frame, with rigid joints, it is shown that the frame design is not sensitive to <b>serviceability</b> <b>deflections</b> and that the frame is 24 % cheaper (in terms of material costs per square m) than using hot-rolled steel. When the effects of semi-rigid joints and stressed-skin action are included, it is shown that the cost of members is further reduced by 32 %.

40|$|A {{numerical}} plastic-layer procedure {{based on}} a simplified finite element method is proposed {{for the analysis of}} composite flooring frames in a <b>serviceability</b> <b>deflection</b> limit state which allows for the spread of concrete cracks along the length of a beam. It allows for a very important effect of partial interaction between the steel beam and the concrete slab. In the proposed method, discrete shear connectors are assumed to be continuous along the beam-slab interface. Thus, the entire composite beam is modelled by a single element with a hybrid mixed-shape function for the transverse deformation which is superior to the currently used polynomial displacement functions. The application of the proposed method is demonstrated through a number of worked examples. When using the proposed numerical integration technique and associated mixed-formed element for modelling of material cracking and yielding, a single element per member is already adequate for large deflection analysis of composite frames with arbitrarily distributed concrete cracks.

40|$|Composite floor {{systems are}} being {{increasingly}} used in building and footbridge constructions, {{as they are}} economical and easy to construct. These composite floor systems use high strength material to achieve longer spans and are thus slender. As a result, they are vulnerable to vibration induced under service loads.

The purpose of this study is to provide an appropriate analysis methodology through finite element analysis to assess the dynamic responses of composite slab and corresponding human comfort problems. A linear elastic finite element analysis through consideration of walking load model (applied in mid-span) with respect to application of different percentages of ply orientation and stacking sequences of FRP laminate in slab is conducted.

40|$|This study simulates the {{flexural}} {{behavior of}} ultra-high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) beams reinforced with steel and glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) rebars. For this, micromechanics-based modeling was first {{carried out on}} the basis of single fiber pullout models considering inclination angle. Two different tension-softening curves (TSCs) with the assumptions of 2 -dimensional (2 -D) and 3 -dimensional (3 -D) random fiber orientations were obtained from the micromechanics-based modeling, and linear elastic compressive and tensile models before the occurrence of cracks were obtained from the mechanical tests and rule of mixture. Finite element analysis incorporating smeared crack model was used due to the multiple cracking behaviors of structural UHPFRC beams, and the characteristic length of two times the element width (or two times the average crack spacing at the peak load) was suggested as a result of parametric study. Analytical results showed that the assumption of 2 -D random fiber orientation is appropriate to a non-reinforced UHPFRC beam, whereas the assumption of 3 -D random fiber orientation is suitable for UHPFRC beams reinforced with steel and GFRP rebars due to disorder of fiber alignment from the internal reinforcements. The micromechanics-based finite element analysis also well predicted the <b>serviceability</b> <b>deflections</b> of UHPFRC beams with GFRP rebars and hybrid reinforcements.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the deformation response of an unequal two-span pultruded glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) wide flange (WF) beam up to the <b>deflection</b> <b>serviceability</b> limit is described. The beam was subjected to vertical point loading at {{the centre of the}} longer span. Mid-span deflections, support rotations and outer surface flange strains recorded during major- and minor-axis flexure tests on the beam are presented and shown to be both repeatable and linear. New closed-form shear deformation equations are presented for the forces and displacements of two-span continuous beams of arbitrary span ratio with the longer span subjected to a vertical mid-span point load. The equations have been used to predict the mid-span deflections, support rotations and surface strains recorded during the flexure tests. It is shown that the equations are able to predict the experimental deflections accurately. Depending on the particular support, the rotations (particularly the minor-axis rotations) are slightly under/over-estimated and, in general, the surface strains are over-estimated. It is concluded that this investigation provides further confirmation of the utility of shear deformation continuous beam equations for predicting the deformations of pultruded GFRP beams up to the <b>deflection</b> <b>serviceability</b> limit...|$|R
40|$|The {{deflection}} {{of steel}} RC beams {{is a major}} design consideration and becomes of particular importance for FRP RC beams as the modulus of the reinforcement can be much lower than that for steel.

Current procedures for quantifying the short term <b>serviceability</b> <b>deflection</b> of steel RC beams rely on an empirical approach for determining an effective flexural rigidity. Being empirically based these effective flexural rigidities can only be used for steel reinforcement, and if extended to FRP reinforcement a very large amount of testing to cover {{the wide range of}} moduli and bond associated with FRP reinforcement would be required. To reduce the amount of testing a mechanics based approach is described for deriving the equivalent of the effective flexural rigidity that is required for design.

In many types of concrete structure loss the serviceability due to wide cracks, number of cracks or large deflection is not uncommon behaviour in concrete structures or concrete beams.

Testing is performed on two batches of nominally identical specimens. One batch had web cleats of pultruded FRP and the other had structural steel. The structural behavior of the joints is based on their moment-rotation responses, failure modes, and serviceability vertical deflection limits. Joints with FRP cleats failed by delamination cracking {{at the top of}} the cleats, and when the cleats were of steel, the FRP failure occurred inside the column members. Neither failure mode is reported in the design manuals from pultruders. At the onset of the FRP damage, it was found that the steel joints were twice as stiff as the FRP joints. On the basis of a characteristic (damage) rotation, calculated in accordance with Eurocode 0, the <b>serviceability</b> <b>deflection</b> limits are established to be span/ 300 and span/ 650 for the joints with FRP and steel cleats, respectively.

This paper presents a repairing technique of the AFRP sheets that effectively strengthens RC beams, controls both the failure modes and the stress distribution around the beam chords and enhances the <b>serviceability</b> (<b>deflection</b> produced under working loads be sufficiently small and cracking be controlled) of pre-cracked RC beams with openings. To investigate the possible damage that {{was caused by}} the service load and to simulate the structure behavior in the site, a comprehensive experimental study was performed. Two un-strengthened control beams, four beams that were pre-cracked before the application of the AFRP sheets and one beam that was strengthened without pre-cracking were tested. Cracking was first induced, followed by repair using various orientations of AFRP sheets, and then the beams were tested to failure. This load was kept constant during the strengthening process. The results show that both the preexisting damage level and the FRP orientation {{have a significant effect on}} strengthening effectiveness and failure mode. All of the strengthened specimens exhibited higher capacities with capacity enhancements ranging from 21.8 to 66.4 %, and the crack width reduced by 25.6 – 82.7 % at failure load compared to the control beam.

This paper {{is concerned with the}} serviceability limit state of composite steel-concrete slabs, placing particular attention to the effects produced by concrete shrinkage on the structural response. In particular, a preliminary study is presented to outline the differences obtained in calculated deflections based on design models available in international guidelines or used by practicing engineers. Only simplysupported static configurations have been considered in this paper. In the initial part of the paper, the main aspects related to the time-dependent behaviour of concrete are introduced, followed by the description of three service design models which range in the approach used to account for shrinkage (i. e. varying from omitting shrinkage in the deflection calculations to adopting different representations for its variation over the slab thickness). The differences observed in these preliminary comparisons highlight the significance of including a non-uniform shrinkage gradient in <b>serviceability</b> <b>deflection</b> calculations. In particular, the non-uniform shrinkage profile develops due to the inability of moisture to dry from the underside of the slab due to the presence of the steel sheeting and has been observed in recent experimental long-term experiments.

40|$|Rebar {{corrosion}} is {{the most}} frequent cause of deterioration in reinforced concrete (RC) structures. Corrosion damage can adversely affect the material and bond properties in RC, which may lead to premature in-service failures. Several studies have investigated the effects of corrosion on the residual performance of RC elements, such as under-reinforced beams; however a significant scatter is observed in the available experimental data. Lack of consistent interpretation of the available data is a major hurdle in reaching reliable conclusions on the behaviour of corroding members, leading to conservative estimation of their residual performance during assessment. In this paper, the performance of corroding under-reinforced beams is investigated using the response surface method (RSM), in which non-linear finite element analysis (NLFEA) serves as “numerical experiments”. Corrosion damage is taken into account using empirical/semi-empirical models derived from the experimental data. Low-order polynomial (RSM) models are obtained for the load at <b>serviceability</b> limit <b>deflection,</b> yield-load capacity, and displacement ductility factor (μδ) of the corroding beams, using suitable experimental designs.

Two joint configurations are considered with either three or two bolts per cleat leg, as per drawings in a pultruder’s Design Manual. Moment-rotation curves, failure modes and potential performance gains from semi-rigid action are determined from two batches, each having six nominally identical joints. Results show that initial joint properties for stiffness and moment can possess, at 19 to 62 %, an extremely high coefficient of variation. All joints failed by fracturing within the FRP column’s flange outstands. Because this failure mode {{has not been}} reported previously {{there is a need}} to establish how its existence influences joint design. As joint properties for the three- and two-bolted configurations are not significantly different, the middle (third) bolt is found to be redundant.

A review of eight wood/concrete niche areas identified three with potential to be used in mid- to high-rise structures. Light-frame wood structures of seven or more storeys with wood/concrete hybrid flooring seem to have little feasibility unless a concrete lateral-load-resisting system is provided and material incompatibilities are solved. Non-load-bearing light-frame wood infill walls in reinforced concrete frame structures were recognized to have potential feasibility in mid- to high-rise structures.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study on 99 under-reinforced concrete beams which were subjected to corrosion before and after the cover zone was repaired with three different generic materials. The repairs represented a wide range of tensile strengths, elastic modulii, ductility and permeabilities. The beams were reinforced with two longitudinal bars, and shear reinforcement was provided externally by steel collars. Different degrees of reinforcement corrosion were induced before and after repair; ranging incrementally from 0 % to 5 %, at a corrosion rate of 3 mA/cm(2). The results show that low ultimate flexural strengths and high deflections under service loading result in corroding beams which incorporate repairs made with materials having the following combination of properties. low strain capacity and low tensile strength, high stiffness, high flexural strength and very low permeability. A relatively ductile repair material with a high coarse aggregate content provides significantly superior structural performance. Time-performance functions for the corroding beams have also been derived by non-linear regression analysis of the experimental data. These can be used to assess (a) long-term ultimate flexural strength of repaired beams undergoing known rates of reinforcement corrosion, and (b) the limiting flexural load capacity required of corroding beams in order to prevent excessive deflections.

40|$|Concrete {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{building}} materials in the construction industry in the world. Time dependent behaviour of concrete is the major concern for the structural engineers due to its significant effect in the long term serviceability and durability. Reinforced concrete (RC) members are prone to the effect of time dependent deformations that are known as shrinkage and creep, can produce substantial deformations and deflections to the structure. The mechanics of quantifying the <b>serviceability</b> <b>deflection</b> of RC beams is complex due to flexural cracking and the associated partial interaction (PI) behaviour of slip between the reinforcement and adjacent concrete. Add the additional complexity of time dependent concrete shrinkage to this partial-interaction (PI) behaviour and the problem becomes very complex. Current design and analysis techniques to quantify <b>serviceability</b> <b>deflection</b> of reinforced concrete (RC) members are generally built on two major principles which are full interaction (FI) through the use of moment curvature approaches; and a uniform longitudinal shrinkage strain εsh [sh subscript] within the member to simplify the analysis technique. Both of the premises are gross approximations and with regard to the first premise, RC beams are subject to flexural cracking and the associated partial interaction (PI) behaviour of slip between the reinforcement and adjacent concrete. Furthermore with regard to the second premise, numerous tests have shown that εsh [sh subscript] varies along both the depth and width of the beam and which is far from uniform. Hence there are two major sources of error in the quantification of serviceability deflections of RC beams for design and which are due to the PI mechanisms that occur in practice; and that due to the time dependent material properties of creep and shrinkage. This thesis deals with the development of PI numerical mechanics models with non-linear shrinkage strain variations achieved from a moisture diffusion model developed in this study and that is required to simulate the PI behaviour of RC beams in order to considerably reduce the source of error occurred due to the application of numerical mechanics model. Hence this new mechanics model will allow: the development of better design mechanics rules for serviceability deflection; and also assist in the better quantification of non-linear shrinkage and creep by removing or considerably reducing the existing mechanics source of error. Importantly, this research provides mechanics solutions for all the facets that control the serviceability time dependent behaviour of RC beams and it is envisaged that these numerical mechanics solutions can provide researchers with the tools to develop simple design procedures as they simulate the major mechanisms influencing cracking and tension stiffening in reinforced concrete beams. Current shrinkage test methodology is having some limitations that are all surfaces are exposed to the environment and they are small scaled which leads to a uniformity of shrinkage strain and which are not present in real size RC beams. Therefore in this thesis, a new form of experimental setup for shrinkage have been proposed to better quantify the shrinkage variations along both the width and depth of RC members with varying the sizes and surface boundary conditions.

40|$|While the {{technology}} of post-tensioning has been widely used and well developed in concrete structures, {{it has also been}} applied to other structures, such as timber frame construction. In addition, post-tensioning, along with other strengthening techniques such as retrofitting and carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP), has been used to strengthen and upgrade existing steel structures using similar materials and setup as in post-tensioned concrete beams. However {{the technology}} required for prestressed members can be very expensive and not widely available in many developing countries, or even in remote areas of developed countries such as Australia, and, if specified, may prove to be uneconomical if for example personnel and equipment have to be imported or relocated. The objective of this thesis is therefore to introduce and investigate local post-tensioning (LPT) as a simple and low-cost alternative to modern high-tech post-tensioning techniques. LPT uses conventional reinforcing bars and a manual screw jack (in the case of concrete or steel members) or bracing straps and bracing tensioners (in the case of timber members), instead of tendons and hydraulic jacks, to apply post-tensioning to the new or existing structure. This research investigated LPT reinforced concrete, timber and steel beams, resulting in the following findings: •	Four large-scale concrete beams were locally post-tensioned and tested. Theoretical predictions were made based on AS 3600 - 2009 and a new theoretical approach was proposed to determine the cracking moment of tested beams, since the current design guide was not applicable to this post-tensioning method. •	LPT timber panels were investigated as an application to new structures. Six identicalpanels made of butt jointed and nailed timber beams were post-tensioned and tested under four-point bending. These were compared with equivalent panels made from continuous unjointed beams. In addition, the dynamic behaviour of these panels was experimentally investigated. Results showed that the post-tensioning created hogging deflections and decreased the overall <b>serviceability</b> <b>deflections</b> by almost half of their values; moreover, LPT affected the dynamic behaviour of these panels, in particular the damping ratio, which significantly decreased but remained within the acceptable limits. •	The effectiveness of LPT to enhance the repair of damaged steel beams was studied. Six repaired beams with different bar diameters and levels of pre-stress were tested under three-points bending. The level of post-tensioning controlled the beams’ stiffness, while restoration of their ultimate load-carrying capacity was governed by the bar size. Significantly higher repaired capacities were achieved by this method than by other published methods used for the strengthening of steel beams. •	Upgrading of intact steel beams using LPT was also investigated. In total, seven beams were upgraded and tested under three-point bending, using different configurations of reinforcing steel. The level of post-tensioning, the type of LPT (internal or external) and the diameter of reinforcing bars used significantly affected the beams’ stiffness and their ultimate load-carrying capacity. The results obtained in this study compared favourably with those of other methods used for upgrading steel beams...|$|R
40|$|To serve {{its purpose}} a {{structure}} must be safe against collapse and serviceable in use. <b>Serviceability</b> requires that <b>deflections</b> be adequately small {{to keep the}} cracks within tolerable limits. Although the widely followed ACI Code suggests a detailed method of deflection calculation, it often cannot exactly perceive the actual behavior of a structure. For this purpose, finite element analysis, using ANSYS, was performed. The research aimed of developing a program {{for the analysis of}} a column fixed at base and observes lateral deflection. Concept of key point, nodes, meshing and separate elements was used to model the concrete and the reinforcement. The scope of the study is limited to lateral load only applied at the midpoint at the top height in X direction. The same operation can also be performed in Y direction. The current application facilitates using random size of column with random height. But to serve the purpose of a single story, the work was done considering only one story height...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: As new {{technologies}} are increasingly applied to civil infrastructure, {{the need for}} structural monitoring systems becomes more critical. <b>Serviceability,</b> or <b>deflection,</b> {{is very important in}} monitoring the health of not only a structural system, but also in analyzing the affects of a new technology applied in the field. A major initiative by the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) to repair and retrofit five bridges in Missouri required serviceability monitoring through a series of load tests. For these tests, surveying equipment was employed in attempt to make serviceability measurement more practicable since most of the bridges had issues related to limited access for traditional monitoring equipment. Until recently, surveying equipment would not have produced the accuracy required for structural monitoring use; however, manufacturers of this equipment have developed {{new technologies}} to increase the accuracy of the instrumentation. The major component used in this study, the total station, can measure deflection accurate to 0. 2 millimeters. This monitoring system is much easier to set up and use, reducing labor and time requirements. The system has almost no site restrictions. This paper will discuss the implementation of the total station and contrast its use to traditional load testing monitoring equipment. Introduction: Load testing is an effective means of evaluating the performance of a structure [1]. In the case of bridge rehabilitation with new strengthening technologies, diagnostic load testing is required to verify the effects of remediation on the bridge [2]. Protocol for load testing should be carefully planned; however, no guidelines for loa...|$|R
40|$|The {{public and}} {{construction}} industry professionals {{are becoming increasingly}} aware of the environmental damage buildings can cause. As a result the use of more sustainable and environmentally friendly building materials and techniques is increasing. Straw bale construction is one such technique. ModCell panels are an innovative way of using straw bales in a prefabricated wall system. As ModCell panels are prefabricated the normal risks associated with straw bale construction (fire, straw getting wet during construction, unfamiliar material) are removed from the building site. The panels consist of a timber frame, braced with steel rods, in-filled with straw bales and the surfaces are then rendered with a lime render. To date ModCell panels {{have been used for}} cladding on framed buildings. However, they are now being developed for low rise domestic load-bearing applications and in order to achieve this sufficient racking shear resistance is required. Previous testing has shown that the corner joints in the panel’s timber frame are a weak point. This first aim of this thesis is to improve the racking shear resistance of ModCell panels through a series of experimental laboratory based tests {{so that they can be}} used for load-bearing applications. This thesis also aims to develop a computer model of load-bearing ModCell panels in order to further understand their structural behaviour and assist with future design and development. Different designs of frame corner joints were tested in order to find the most suitable type of joint. Screw connected joints proved to be the strongest and were twice as stiff as the other joint designs tested. Full scale panel racking shear tests were undertaken to assess the overall performance of the panels when using the screw connected joints and establish if they are suitable for load-bearing construction. Both solid panels and panels with window openings were tested. Two types of bracing were used in the test panels, either corner bracing or cross bracing. The corner braced panels were over twice as stiff as panels tested during a previous research project. The corner braced panels were also stiffer than the cross braced panels at the <b>serviceability</b> <b>deflection</b> limit of the panels height/ 500, and was sufficiently stiff to resist the required in plane loading under serviceability conditions. The computer model was developed alongside the structural testing. The model was developed using the Robot Millennium software package and modelled all elements of the panels apart from the straw. It was verified against the laboratory test results and found to be accurate within the <b>serviceability</b> <b>deflection</b> limit of height/ 500. Once material failure occurred in the actual panels the model’s accuracy was reduced as it does not include material failure criteria. The model was then used to undertake a parametric analysis. From this analysis it was found that all the elements modelled have an effect on the stiffness of ModCell panels. Changing the render thickness was found to make the greatest difference on the overall stiffness of the panels. Gusset plate and glued and screwed joint designs were also modelled to find their effect on panel stiffness. From all of the results of this analysis an improved panel was designed and when modelled was 20 % stiffer than the original panel...|$|E
40|$|Steel-deck {{composite}} floor {{systems are}} being increasingly used in high-rise building construction, especially in Australia, {{as they are}} economical and easy to construct. These composite floor systems use high strength materials to achieve longer spans and are thus slender. As a result, they are vulnerable to vibration induced under service loads. These floors are normally designed using static methods which will not reveal the true behaviour and miss the dynamic amplifications resulting in inappropriate designs, which ultimately cause vibration and discomfort to occupants. At present there is no adequate design guidance to address the vibration in these composite floors, {{due to a lack}} of research information, resulting in wasteful post event retrofits. To address this gap in knowledge, a comprehensive research project is presented in this thesis, which investigated the dynamic performance of composite floors under various human induced loads. A popular type of composite floor system was selected for this investigation and subjected to load models representing different human activities. These load models have variable parameters such as load intensity, activity type (contact ratio), activity frequency and damping and are applied as pattern loads to capture the maximum responses in terms of deflections and accelerations. Computer models calibrated against experimental results are used in the analysis to generate the required information. The dynamic responses of deflections and accelerations are compared with the <b>serviceability</b> <b>deflection</b> limits and human comfort levels (of accelerations) to assess these floor types. This thesis also treats the use of visco-elastic (VE) dampers to mitigate excessive vibrations in steel-deck composite floors. VE damper properties have been presented and their performances in reducing the excessive vibrations have been assessed this thesis. The results identified possible occupancies under different loading conditions that can be used in planning, design and evaluation. The findings can also be used to plan retrofitting measures in problematic floor systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{deterioration}} of steel in aging reinforced concrete bridges is a continual problem which {{could benefit from}} improved rehabilitation techniques that take advantage of enhanced and more durable materials such as fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. Appropriately designed hybrid material systems benefit from the performance and durability advantages of FRP materials yet remain more cost effective than comparable all-composite systems. Development of rapid rehabilitation systems for the decks of concrete box girder bridges, which are increasingly common throughout the United States, is presented. One goal {{of this research is}} to assess and validate the use of FRP composite panels for use as both stay-in-place formwork and as the bottom longitudinal and transverse reinforcement in the deck of concrete box girder bridges. Performance assessments for full-scale two -cell box girder bridge specimens through monotonic and extensive cyclic loading provided validation for the FRP panel system bridge deck as a viable rehabilitation solution for box girder bridge decks. The FRP panel system performed comparably to a conventionally reinforced concrete bridge deck in terms of <b>serviceability,</b> <b>deflection</b> profiles, and system level structural interaction and performed superior to the RC bridge deck in terms of residual deflections, and structural response under cyclic loading. Assessment of a damaged FRP panel bridge deck system, which was repaired using a resin injection technique, showed superior performance for the repaired system in terms of integrity of the FRP panel interface and cyclic response. Rapid rehabilitation techniques for strengthening reinforced concrete box girder bridge deck overhangs using near-surface-mounted (NSM) carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) were also evaluated. Analytical predictions of load carrying capacity and deflections provided correlation with experimental results, and the developed analysis methods provide an effective design tool for future research. Results from the laboratory testing of a bridge deck overhang strengthened with FRP showed significant increases in load carrying capacity as well as deformation capacity as compared to the as-built specimen without FRP. This research provides enhanced understanding of hybrid structures and indicates significant potential for rehabilitation applications to concrete box girder bridges...|$|E
40|$|Relatively large {{construction}} loads {{applied to}} immature slabs with their low elastic moduli will cause large initial elastic deflections. The high applied stress/developed strength ratio will cause significant creep, resulting in large long-term deflections. Shrinkage, while {{not related to}} construction loads, also contributes to long-term deflections. Studies reported by many investigators showed that the long-term deflections cannot be ignored in the design process and that {{the contribution of the}} effects of the construction loads cannot be ignored. The influence of the construction loads on the long-term <b>deflection</b> <b>serviceability</b> means that the construction process cannot be independent of the design considerations. However, ACI 318 and CSA A 23. 3, specify maximum span thickness ratios for which deflections need not be considered. A computer investigation of the long-term deflections for flat plates, of typical dimensions, was effected using a finite element analysis program for several possible load histories. The study indicated that the present span thickness recommendations of ACI 318 and CSA A 23. 3 would not necessarily prevent excessive deflections. The study also indicates that, in most cases, the code requirement of total deflection not to exceed l/ 240 was critical and could not be met...|$|R
40|$|Excessive {{deflections}} {{in concrete}} members during the service {{life of a}} building that are not accounted for in design lead to structurally inefficient buildings. Indirect results are the visible appearance of cracks in partition walls and other elements supported by these members, leading to <b>serviceability</b> problems. Hence, <b>deflection</b> analysis is important {{to ensure that the}} reinforced or prestressed concrete flexural member will deflect within the allowable limits during its lifetime. Many factors contribute to the deflection of concrete members such as concrete properties, reinforcement and tendon properties, creep and shrinkage, loading sequence, cracking, bond-slip behaviour between concrete and steel. Hence, the primary objectives of this research are to develop an analytical model to evaluate the time-dependent deflections in post-tensioned concrete suspended slabs considering above factors and validate this model by using real-life measurements of long-term slab deformations. For this purpose actual deflections of one-way spanning slabs and band beams of a multi-level office building under construction are being measured and experimental testing of concrete compressive strength, concrete creep, shrinkage, modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity were carried out. This paper presents a comparison between measured on site deflections of slabs and beams during construction with calculated deflections using the simplified method given in AS 3600...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of {{pedestrian}} bridges built from composites materials has notably increased. The combination of fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) profiles with fiber reinforced concrete (FRC) elements is being adopted {{in this type of}} structures, since the ductility, high post-cracking tensile strength, compressive stiffness and strength of FRC can be combined with the benefits derived from the use of FRP’s profiles to obtain high performance structural systems. In the context of the present work a 12 m long single span pedestrian bridge with two composite Iprofiles was designed. In terms of deflection requirements imposed by serviceability limit states, the influence of the height and thickness of GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer) profiles, as well as the addition of a thin layer of prestressed carbon fiber sheet in the bottom flange of the GFRP profile was evaluated. Using software based on the finite element method, the structural behavior of the developed structural systems was analyzed. Furthermore, two prototypes of this structural system were built and monitored in order to assess their long-term deformational behavior when subjected to a loading configuration correspondent to the load combination for the <b>deflection</b> <b>serviceability</b> limit states.
