Moreover, public opinion refused to make distinctions inside this group – which the press called “Esodati”, referring to a forced exodus from the labor market – and considered all of them as equally deserving to be safeguarded, irrespective of the heterogeneity of their situations. In a couple of subsequent provisions, the government added other 65, 000, making a total of 130, 000 safeguarded workers.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to take a closer look at the Seventh Accession Treaty and the terms of {{membership}} it provides for. The starting point is an overview of the structure, the rules on entry into force, the legal character of the Seventh Accession Treaty as well as the accession of Croatia to the Founding Treaties forming the core of EU’s primary law and some of their most recent modifications. This section is followed by analysis of the institutional provisions facilitating the phasing in of the Croatian authorities into the EU decision making machinery. It is important to take a look at both - the institutional framework for the period between the signature of the Accession Treaty and following its entry into force. This will lead to the analysis of immediate effect of EU law and threats to the effective application of EU law after the accession. Adaptations to the existing EU acquis and transitional periods are analysed in turn.

40|$|The EU {{has most}} {{frequently}} resorted to harmonisation {{as a model}} to achieve its in-ternal market. This contribution examines the dynamics of legal differentiation in EU’s internal market law laid down in Article 114 TFEU and secondary laws. It con-cludes {{that there has been}} a modest number of invocations of the derogation possibili-ties under Article 114 (4) and (5) TFEU and the <b>safeguard</b> <b>clauses.</b> The low number may be due to the fact that may both the Commission and the Courts have a very rig-id reading of the procedure whilst the grounds for invocation are very limited. This low number nevertheless does not automatically imply that Member States agree with the level of protection laid down in the EU’s harmonisation measures or that the opt out mechanisms are not relevant. Derogation mechanisms may play an important role in the negotiations of the level of protection in the draft legislative acts. This study moreover reveals that the derogation mechanisms may be important devices of regulatory adjustment and learning in the fields of public health and environmental protection in the EU. They ultimately may rather strengthen the uniformity of regula-tory requirements in the EU internal market instead of leading to regulatory diversity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} macroeconomic {{and monetary}} policy-making at the European Commission, covering {{the period from}} the Rome Treaties to the Hague Summit. It {{is based on an}} analysis of public documents, archival research and interviews with former policy-makers. The paper starts with an overview of the economic philosophy of the Rome Treaties and senior macroeconomic policy-makers at the Commission, followed by an analysis of economic developments in the 1960 s. Thereafter, the focus is on three crucial macroeconomic policy documents of the period: the European Reserve Fund project in 1958, the Commission's Action Programme for the Second Stage of the EEC of October 1962 and the Barre [Barr] Memorandum of October 1969. [The Barr Plan I-III are on the Archive in the AEI-EU section - search for Barr]. The Commission’s objectives tended to be both defensive, preserving the "acquis communautaire", especially avoiding recourse to the <b>safeguard</b> <b>clauses,</b> and pro-active, stimulating the process of European integration. From an analytical point of view, the Commission focussed on the compatibility of policies between the Member States. Gradually, a typical Commission analysis developed, based on a blending of German convergence ideas with the French medium-term approach. The paper further illustrates the ascent of the Commission as an actor in the monetary area, notwithstanding the relatively limited provisions of the EEC Treaty...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{concerns}} surrounding the import (for food and feed uses or processing) of genetically modified herbicide tolerant (GMHT) oilseed rape is that, through seed spillage, the herbicide tolerance (HT) trait will escape into agricultural or semi-natural habitats, causing environmental or economic problems. Based on these concerns, three EU countries have invoked national <b>safeguard</b> <b>clauses</b> to ban the marketing of specific GMHT oilseed rape events on their territory. However, the scientific basis for the environmental and economic concerns posed by feral GMHT oilseed rape resulting from seed import spills is debatable. While oilseed rape has characteristics such as secondary dormancy and small seed size that enable it to persist and be redistributed in the landscape, the presence of ferals is not in itself an environmental or economic problem. Crucially, feral oilseed rape has not become invasive outside cultivated and ruderal habitats, and HT traits {{are not likely to}} result in increased invasiveness. Feral GMHT oilseed rape has the potential to introduce HT traits to volunteer weeds in agricultural fields, but would only be amplified if the herbicides to which HT volunteers are tolerant were used routinely in the field. However, this worst-case scenario is most unlikely, as seed import spills are mostly confined to port areas. Economic concerns revolve around the potential for feral GMHT oilseed rape to contribute to GM admixtures in non-GM crops. Since feral plants derived from cultivation (as distinct from import) occur at too low a frequency to affect the coexistence threshold of 0. 9...|$|R

40|$|The Uruguay Round marks an {{important}} {{turning point for}} the developing countries. The three core agreements on which the new World Trade Organization (WTO) is based present a remarkable range of obligations and responsibilities {{for a set of}} countries that were effectively outside any multilateral discipline on trade matters. Meanwhile, the few concrete gains that accrue to developing countries, such as the phasing out of the MFA, are suspiciously back-loaded. This is the wrong way to read the significance of the Uruguay Round for them, however. First of all, {{there are a number of}} important ways in which the Uruguay Round agreements promise to strengthen multilateral discipline in world trade. This is especially true in the area of dispute settlement. Second, since taking advantage of international trade is part and parcel of good development strategy, most of the developing country `concessions' need to be entered on the positive side of the balance sheet, and not viewed as a liability. Finally, there may be some subtle ways in which the Uruguay Round agreements can help developing country governments build better structures of governance at home to enhance the performance of their economies in areas that go beyond trade. The real threats to developing countries lie in the post-Uruguay agenda, in the demands for upward harmonization in the areas of labour and environment. A well-designed social <b>safeguards</b> <b>clause</b> will not necessarily be inimical to the interests of developing countries, and may forestall the emergence of a new set of `grey area' measures outside of the WTO.

40|$|This {{working paper}} {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} legal personality of non-state actors {{as an indicator of}} the democratic legitimacy of international organizations (IOs). Globalization has led to changes in statehood which are reflected in new democratic forms of participation and new expectations and attitudes towards political institutions. This also affects international politics in that international organizations are questioned with regard to their own legitimacy. In this context, normatively and empirically based policy proposals alike tend to suggest an increased role of new actors, mostly civil society organizations (CSOs) or NGOs, in overcoming the legitimacy deficit of IOs. However, if participation of non-state actors in international governance is to be effective, efficient and have a meaningful and lasting effect, it requires institutional rights and duties - and with it legal personality. Thus, legal personality of non-state actors can be taken as a minimum <b>safeguarding</b> <b>clause</b> for surmounting the legitimacy deficit of international organizations (normative approach). It can also be used as a helpful analytical framework for organizing empirical data on the participation of these actors in IOs (empirical approach). This working paper evaluates the legal rights and duties of NGOs in their cooperation with more than 30 international organizations and seeks to assess whether this implies that they have acquired legal personality and which quality this personality takes on. Such a comparative paper is a novelty in both political science and international law. By combining perspectives from two disciplines, this working paper illustrates the intrinsic empirical and theory-building value of (international) positive law in political science. [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, {{it is argued}} that (1) the Accession Treaties have been used in {{accordance}} with their nature and proclaimed objective: they only brought about limited changes to primary law, proper to the needs of accession and have not introduced any fundamental changes. The numerous and still growing arrangements that depart from the principle of the application of the acquis in toto on accession do not alter this conclusion. (2) The evolution, especially from the 2004 Accession Treaty onwards and predictable for the future Accession Treaties (e. g. with Turkey), shows a tendency of diversification of that legal instrument by (a) adding new and/or reinforced elements of conditionality, protracted from the pre-accession phase to the membership phase, devising new mechanisms of conditionality and control (general and specific <b>safeguard</b> <b>clauses,</b> monitoring and verification mechanisms, membership postponement clause) and thus (b) contributing to a further differentiation in two respects - as among the Member States and with regard to the core acquis. Such differentiation exists already {{on the basis of the}} constitutive treaties (“in-built constitutive treaties induced differentiation”) and is accentuated by the Accession Treaties and their transitional arrangements (“Accession Treaties induced differentiation”). Questions of differentiation acquired another dimension with the introduction of the citizenship of the EU. (3) Finally, negotiations with certain candidate countries will show whether additional innovations are to be expected: a) whether future instruments of accession would be used in order to increase the existing level of differentiation (and protract the pre-accession phase logic well into the membership phase) with the conditionality becoming the most important element of the relations within an enlarged EU and thus paradoxically negating the nature of the integration itself, b) whether they will perhaps be used to bring about more important modifications to the treaties, or c) whether they will go as far as to provide a legal basis for permanent derogations with regard to certain new Member States (as explicitly envisaged, for instance, in the negotiating framework for Turkey) ...|$|R
