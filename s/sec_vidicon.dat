50|$|The first {{detection}} of a CME as such {{was made on}} 14 December 1971, by R. Tousey (1973) of the Naval Research Laboratory using the seventh Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO-7). The discovery image (256 Ã— 256 pixels) was collected on a Secondary Electron Conduction (<b>SEC)</b> <b>vidicon</b> tube, transferred to the instrument computer after being digitized to 7 bits. Then it was compressed using a simple run-length encoding scheme and sent {{down to the ground}} at 200 bit/s. A full, uncompressed image would take 44 minutes to send down to the ground. The telemetry was sent to ground support equipment (GSE) which built up the image onto Polaroid print. David Roberts, an electronics technician working for NRL who had been responsible for the testing of the SEC-vidicon camera, was in charge of day-to-day operations. He thought that his camera had failed because certain areas of the image were much brighter than normal. But on the next image the bright area had moved away from the Sun and he immediately recognized this as being unusual and took it to his supervisor, Dr. Guenter Brueckner, and then to the solar physics branch head, Dr. Tousey. Earlier observations of coronal transients or even phenomena observed visually during solar eclipses are now understood as essentially the same thing.|$|E

40|$|An {{externally}} occulted Lyot coronagraph {{employing a}} digitized <b>SEC</b> <b>vidicon</b> detection {{system is a}} prime experiment aboard the NASA Orbiting Solar Observatory 7 (OSO 7). Continuing daily operation since the 29 September 1971 launch has produced more than 2200 pictures of the solar white light corona covering the region between 3 R and 10 R. Important advantages of the <b>SEC</b> <b>vidicon</b> in this application are its ability to integrate an electron image and store it for long periods prior to readout. Special applications of digital techniques are employed in stepping and pulsing the readout electron beam, thereby realizing the detector's inherent qualities of high resolution and large dynamic range...|$|E
40|$|Performance {{characteristics}} of Bendix type BX 08025 - 4522 proximity-focussed vacuum-ultraviolet to visible-light image converters are presented. The converters {{are to be}} used with <b>SEC</b> <b>vidicons</b> as detectors for an echelle spectrograph on the International Ultraviolet Explorer astronomical satellite. Magnesium fluoride input windows with Cs-Te photocathodes are used in the converters, with P- 11 phosphors on the fiber optic output windows. Quantum efficiencies, modulation transfer function, background, geometric distortion, and environmental test results are presented for the wavelength region from 1150 to 3500 A. ...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the advent}} of low light level {{television}} (LLLTV) systems, it has been recognized that such devices offer the ability to observe meteors as faint as 10 th magnitude which allows the extension of optical meteor data to masses as small as 0. 0001 grams. The Space Sciences Lab at Marshall Space Flight Center has been actively engaged in such observations using image orthicons and intensified <b>SEC</b> <b>vidicons.</b> The results of these observations are presented along with an interpretation in terms of mass-flux. This interpretation includes {{the development of a}} relationship between peak luminosity of a meteor and mass, velocity, and zenith angle that was derived from single body meteor theory and compares favorably with results obtained from the Artificial Program. Also included in the mass flux interpretation is an analysis of the observation response of a LLLTV system to fixed and moving point sources...|$|R

40|$|The {{large scale}} {{telescope}} (LST) {{intended as a}} permanent international facility {{to be placed in}} near earth orbit to perform astronomical observations, is discussed. The basic elements of the LST are detailed, and the modulation transfer function is presented. Both basic and special instruments are dealt with. The sensor parameters are listed, and the choice of the <b>SEC</b> <b>Vidicon</b> is justified...|$|E
40|$|Description of a <b>SEC</b> <b>vidicon</b> {{response}} {{model that}} was used to calculate intensities of stars in the ultraviolet. The tube was used only as a stellar filter photometer. The model proposed is applicable for point sources. Experiments with both curve- or surface-fitting techniques and with extrapolation-interpolation procedures were conducted. The curve-fitting techniques were not successful, and the target gain was calculated with the aid of interpolation techniques...|$|E
40|$|The International Ultraviolet Explorer {{spectral}} image processing system is an on-line interactive system which provides {{data on the}} UV spectra of astronomical objects in the wavelength range 1000 to 3200 A. In operation for one year, the image processing system accepts two-dimensional images transmitted digitally from the satellite's <b>SEC</b> <b>vidicon</b> cameras.

40|$|The <b>SEC</b> <b>Vidicon,</b> a {{low light}} level closed circuit {{television}} system, was used to obtain 137 spectrographic records of meteors at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona, during the Geminid meteor shower in December 1972. Seven of the best Geminid meteor spectra are studied here in detail. The near infrared, out to wavelengths near 9000 A, is recorded {{for the first time}} for Geminids. The spectra, in general, exhibit the elements previously found in photographic records of this shower but show a surprising frequency of occurrence of the forbidden green line of O I at 5577 A. This line is normally absent from meteors moving as slowly as the Geminids (36 km/sec) and its presence in these records {{may be due to the}} added sensitivity available with the <b>SEC</b> <b>Vidicon.</b> The average green line duration in Geminid meteors with a luminosity near zero absolute visual magnitude is 0. 73 sec at a mean height of 95 km, 11 km lower than the green line peak in Perseid meteors of the same luminosity...|$|E
40|$|A {{slow scan}} <b>SEC</b> <b>vidicon</b> system is {{described}} here. This system is coupled to the 152. 4 -cm (60 -in) McMath telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. An anamorphic lens system {{is used to}} couple optically the vertical spectrograph to the vidicon system.

Application of this procedure to spectra of Rho Oph and Beta(1) Sco near the spin-forbidden interstellar 2325 line of C II yields 2 sigma upper limits on absorption of W (lambda) not greater than about 4 mA. The resulting depletion of carbon from the interstellar gas toward Rho Oph exceeds a factor of 1. 4...|$|E
40|$|The {{scientific}} purpose, coronal observations, and {{the instrument}} design {{and control of}} the Coronagraph/Polarimeter aboard the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) satellite are discussed. The instruments were made with an optical design using an achromatic objective lens providing a 10 arcsec resolution in imaging and an <b>SEC</b> <b>vidicon</b> detector allowing integration on the low light levels of the corona. The computer control assures flexibility in the observing program to optimize observations of changing solar phenomena and allows rapid response to SMM or ground-commanded solar flare alerts...|$|E

Following a discussion of the main system and instrumentation features and a delineation of present and future software tasks, the preliminary series of observations obtained in conjunction with the 36 -inch telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory is briefly surveyed. These observations include (1) exposures on the Orion Nebula through various narrow-band interference filters, and (2) exposures on the galaxy Messier 82 in white light and with medium band filters...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{techniques for}} examining comets and meteors. Data was obtained on four nights around {{the peak of}} the Geminid shower, using <b>SEC</b> <b>Vidicon</b> equipment at Mount Hopkins Observatory in Arizona at a latitude of 31 deg 41. 9 north, longitude 110 deg 52. 7 west, and 2320 meters above sea level. The TV employed, was mated to an f/ 0. 75 lens of 105 mm focal length, and agove the lens a transmission diffraction grating was fixed with 300 lines/mm.

40|$|A dual star-tracking {{system and}} a system {{including}} a telescope, an echelle spectrograph, and a <b>SEC</b> <b>vidicon</b> are the chief components of the Balloon-borne Ultraviolet Stellar Spectrograph (BUSS), which has flown four successful missions. The BUSS missions have yielded 81 spectra for 56 stars, recorded with a resolution of 0. 1 A in the wavelength range from 2200 to 3400 A. BUSS observations include: profiles of Mg II lines indicating considerable mass flow in early-type supergiants; Mg II features suggesting a cool expanding outer shell above a hotter chromosphere; emission features in Zeta Tau (a shell star) indicating infalling material; and emission features of the Be star Phi Per suggesting mass outflow...|$|E
40|$|An {{instrument}} for recording extreme ultraviolet television {{images of the}} sun was flown in the Apollo Telescope Mount on Skylab. Solar radiation in the 171 - 630 A wavelength range, defined by the transmission band of three thin-film aluminum filters, was focused onto a p-quaterphenyl photon conversion layer by a platinum-coated mirror at normal incidence. The conversion layer {{was attached to the}} faceplate of a low light level <b>SEC</b> <b>vidicon.</b> An onboard video monitor enabled the Skylab crews to observe the images in real-time and to identify and follow the development of solar features. Images were also transmitted to the mission control center, where they were used in planning the ATM observing schedule...|$|E
40|$|A TV {{image of}} the entire sun while an {{importance}} 2 N solar flare was in progress was recorded in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation band 171 - 630 A and was transmitted to ground from an Aerobee- 150 rocket on Nov. 4, 1969 using S-band telemetry. The camera tube was a <b>SEC</b> <b>vidicon,</b> with its fiber optic faceplate coated with an XUV-to-visible conversion layer of p-quaterphenyl. The XUV passband was produced by three 1000 -A thick aluminum filters in series together with the platinized reflecting surface of the off-axis paraboloid that imaged the sun. A number of images were recorded with integration times between 1 / 30 sec and 2 sec. Reconstruction of pictures was enhanced by combining several to reduce the noise...|$|E
40|$|The {{engineering}} {{development of}} the <b>SEC</b> <b>vidicon</b> as an astronomical sensor has continued in parallel with its operational use. One scientific application was the six hour exposure of the quasar PHL- 957 at the Coude spectrograph of the 200 -inch Hale telescope. The developmental effort includes both the enhancement of the basic attributes that make the SEC an appropriate sensor, namely, high quantum efficiency, low threshold, and long integration; as well as work to broaden its scientific usefulness, such as {{the development of a}} MgF 2 photocathode window for vacuum ultraviolet sensitivity, and a permanent magnet focus design for thermal compatibility with proposed large space telescopes. Additional details on the characteristics of the SEC tube are discussed, as well as plans to make a larger and higher resolution version...|$|E
40|$|The unique MSFC solar vector magnetograph allows {{measurements}} {{of all three}} components of the Sun's photospheric magnetic field over a wide field-of-view with spatial resolution determined by a 2. 7 x 2. 7 arc second pixel size. This system underwent extensive modifications to improve its sensitivity and temporal response. The modifications included replacing an <b>SEC</b> <b>vidicon</b> detector with a solid-state CCD camera; replacing the original digital logic circuitry with an electronic controller and a computer to provide complete, programmable control over the entire operation of the magnetograph; and installing a new polarimeter which consists of a single electro-optical modulator coupled with interchangeable waveplates mounted on a rotating assembly. The system is described and results of calibrations and tests are presented. Initial observations of solar magnetic fields with the new magnetograph are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{synchronous}} orbit of the IUE carries the satellite through Earth's outer electron belt. A 40 mCi Sr 90 source {{was used to}} simulate these electrons. A 5 mCi source of Co 60 was used to simulate bremmstrahlung. A 10 MeV electron Linac and a 1. 7 MeV electron Van de Graaf wer used to investigate the energy dependence of radiation effects and to perform radiations at a high flux rate. A 100 MeV proton cyclotron was used to simulate cosmic rays. Results are presented for three instrument systems of the IUE and measurements for specific components are reported. The three instrument systems were the ultraviolet converter, the fine error sensor (FES), and the <b>SEC</b> <b>vidicon</b> camera tube. The components were optical glasses, electronic components, silicon photodiodes, and UV window materials...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} realize the LST {{objectives}} of high angular resolution, extended wavelength coverage and faint object detection, {{the performance of the}} instruments must be matched to that of the telescope. To insure that adequate technology is available by 1976, an intensive SR & T program has been initiated which builds on previous work and is coordinated with work in other agencies. The primary areas of concern are detectors, on-board computers, and ultraviolet optical components. In the last area grating work is being emphasized. The on-board computer will be necessary to allow pre-processing of raw data and enable detector operation in a pulse counting mode. For detectors, the <b>SEC</b> <b>Vidicon</b> development will be continued but the use of solid-state arrays in the electron bombarded mode and channel plate detectors are being seriously considered. One challenging problem is to provide 2 K cooling to permit ultra-sensitive IR observations to be made...|$|E
40|$|A coude {{spectrum}} of the E 7 galaxy NGC 7332 with 0. 9 A-resolution from 4186 to 4364 A was obtained with the Princeton <b>SEC</b> <b>vidicon</b> television camera and the Hale telescope. Comparisons with spectra of G and K giant stars, numerically broadened for various Maxwellian velocity distributions, give a dispersion velocity {{in the line of}} sight of 160 (plus or minus 20) km/sec with the best fit at G 8 III. The dispersion appears to be constant within plus or minus 35 km/sec out to 1. 4 kpc. After correction for projection, the rotation curve has a slope of 0. 18 km/sec per pc at the center and a velocity of 130 km/sec at 1. 4 kpc where it is still increasing. For an estimated effective radius of 3. 5 kpc enclosing half the light, the virial theorem gives a mass of 140 billion solar masses if the mass-to-light ratio is constant throughout the galaxy...|$|E
40|$|A (256 x 1024) -pixel imaging {{ultraviolet}} Multi-mode Microchannel Array (MAMA) detector {{system for}} flight was fabricated, evaluated, and environmentally tested for flight on the Balloon Borne Ultraviolet Stellar Spectrograph (BUSS). The {{goal of the}} program was to replace the existing <b>SEC</b> <b>Vidicon</b> with the pulse-counting MAMA detector in order to, first, improve the overall sensitivity of the BUSS telescope and spectrograph for observations of stars down to m sub v = 7 and fainter, and, second, to improve the spectral resolution and wavelength accuracy by eliminating the image drifts in the Vidicon caused by magnetic field effects. A sealed MAMA detector tube structure employing a remotely processed photocathode mounted on a window in proximity focus with the front face of the MCP was developed to avoid contamination produced by a noisy and unstable device. The configuration of the BUSS detector system in its flight ready configuration is shown. The quantum efficiency curve for the semi-transparent Cs 2 Te photocathode is also shown...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} observe {{extended}} astronomical objects at high spatial and spectral resolution, a spectroscopic photoelectric imaging Fabry-Perot interferometer was constructed. Among the properties {{chosen for the}} instrument are an air-spaced, piezoelectrically scanned design allowing an accurately settable free spectral range and employing a single etalon of high finesse. Careful design of the etalon mountings and optical train preserves high ligh throughput. Spectra of single spatial elements with a photomultiplier were obtained, and an <b>SEC</b> <b>vidicon</b> detector was used to record a series of images through the interferometer while scanning the wavelength in discrete steps. The latter procedure yields sufficient information to reconstruct spectral features over the entire object, and for the conditions assumed, either series of observations requires {{only a small fraction}} of a rotational period for Jupiter or Saturn. An electronic control system was also constructed which permits rapid and flexible variation of the operational mode of the Fabry-Perot and its ancilliary devices so as to minimize loss of observational time...|$|E
40|$|High-resolution {{spectrophotometry}} of {{the variable}} Ca II K {{line in the}} K 2 IIIp star Alpha Boo was performed with the McMath Solar Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory and an experimental <b>SEC</b> <b>vidicon</b> camera. The results are compared with Copernicus observations of the Mg II h and k lines and with earlier Ca II data. It is found that either of two states may typically occur in the Arcturus chromosphere. From comparison {{with the results of}} model calculations for expanding chromospheres, it is concluded that these correspond respectively to a 'normal' state in which the mass loss is less than one billionth of a solar mass per year and an 'abnormal' state in which the mass loss is about 8 billionths of a solar mass per year. In the latter case, the expansion velocity is around 13 km/s at optical depth unity in the K-line, which exceeds the local sound speed. It is suggested that the abnormal state represents the rise to the photosphere of a very large convective element, as hypothesized for red giants by Schwarzschild (1975) ...|$|E
40|$|Data from {{high-resolution}} <b>SEC</b> <b>vidicon</b> spectroscopy with {{a ground-based}} telescope (for the Ca II K line) and from spectral scans {{made with the}} BUSS ultraviolet balloon spectrograph (for the Mg II h and k lines) are used to derive models of the chromospheres and upper photospheres of three G-K giants. The models are based on partial-redistribution analyses of the Ca II K line wings and cores and on the fluxes in the Mg II lines. The photospheres thus computed are hotter than predicted by radiative-equilibrium models. The minimum-to-effective temperature ratio is found to decrease with decreasing effective temperature, while the mass column density {{at the top of}} the chromosphere increases with decreasing stellar surface gravity. The computed pressure at the chromosphere top in the primary member of the Capella spectroscopic binary system is 70 times smaller than the transition-region pressure derived by Haisch and Linsky (1976), which suggests that additional terms must be included in the transition-region energy equations for giant stars. Estimates of the Ca II and hydrogen column densities are made for the circumstellar envelope of Aldebaran...|$|E
40|$|The {{atmospheric}} emissions photometric imaging experiment (AEPI) to {{be flown}} on Spacelab 1 {{is designed to}} study faint natural and artificial atmospheric emission phenomena. Optical emissions are imaged in the region 2150 A to 7320 A using a television system consisting of two optical channels, one wide-angle and one telephoto. The detection system is an image-enhanced <b>SEC</b> <b>vidicon.</b> A third optical channel images onto the photocathode of a microchannel plate photomultiplier tube that has 100 discrete anodes. Photons are counted for each discrete anode, providing a direct measure of the luminosity of an object viewed by the TV telephoto lens, albeit with low spatial resolution. The AEPI detector is mounted on a two-axis gimbal comprised of a Modified Apollo Telescope Mount Star Tracker (MAST), which provides experiment pointing over a 40 -deg x 80 -deg range, exclusive of restrictions due to the proximity of other experiments. The pointing stability is 1 arcmin {{with respect to the}} spacecraft coordinate system for an exposure of 1 second. The tracking capability is 3. 5 deg/s with a stability of 1 arcmin.
