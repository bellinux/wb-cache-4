The U.S. House of Representatives in February 1912 passed a resolution supporting a Chinese republic, but Taft and Knox felt recognition <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> a concerted action by Western powers. Taft in his final annual message to Congress in December 1912 indicated that he was moving towards recognition once the republic was fully established, but by then he had been defeated for re-election and he did not follow through.|$|E
5|$|Analogue filters {{have played}} an {{important}} part in the development of electronics. Especially in the field of telecommunications, filters have been of crucial importance in a number of technological breakthroughs and have been the source of enormous profits for telecommunications companies. It <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> no surprise, therefore, that the early development of filters was intimately connected with transmission lines. Transmission line theory gave rise to filter theory, which initially took a very similar form, and the main application of filters was for use on telecommunication transmission lines. However, the arrival of network synthesis techniques greatly enhanced the degree of control of the designer.|$|E

25|$|Several reasons can {{be cited}} {{as to why}} the {{professional}} middle class is so influential. One is that journalists, commentators, writers, professors, economists, and political scientists, who are essential in shaping public opinion, are almost exclusively members of the professional middle class. Considering the overwhelming presence of professional middle-class persons in post secondary education, another essential instrument in regards to shaping public opinion, it <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> no surprise that the lifestyle exclusive to this quasi-elite has become indicative of the American mainstream itself. In addition to setting trends, the professional middle class also holds occupations which include managerial duties, meaning that middle-class professionals spend much of their work-life directing others and conceptualizing the workday for the average worker.|$|E

As of August 8, 2008, it has sold 480,000 units in Europe.

Many of her family members {{were involved in the}} film's production: Farmiga's younger sister Taissa portrayed Corinne as a teenager, her husband Renn Hawkey served as a producer and musical director, and her cousin Adriana Farmiga served as an art curator. She received nominations in both acting and directing for the film, including the Gotham Award for Best Breakthrough Director, and the Satellite Award for Best Actress â€“ Motion Picture. In his review of the film, critic Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter noted: [...] "Directing debuts by actors don't come any better than this".

The defeat led {{to the end of}} Specter's nearly 30-year Senate career, the longest of any Pennsylvania Senator in history. Afterward, Sestak declared, [...] "This is what democracy should look like: a win for the people over the establishment. It <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> no surprise to anyone that people want a change." [...] Specter conceded defeat and said, [...] "It's been a great privilege to serve the people of Pennsylvania. It's been a great privilege to be in the United States Senate." [...] Commentators suggested Specter's defeat signaled an electorate unsatisfied with the establishment in both major parties, and indicated that the backing of prominent politicians had little effect on voters during this political age. Sestak's victory was seen as a minor embarrassment for Obama, who strongly and publicly advocated for Specter during the race. Several news outlets reflected that Sestak's television advertisements condemning Specter as a hypocrite and opportunist were especially effective and may have been the primary factor in his victory. The Washington Post said the Pennsylvania race drew more attention than any other primary election in 2010 due to Specter's longevity and his switch to the Democratic party.|$|E
500|$|The author Nicholas Tucker {{notes that}} it was common to see Blyton cited as people's {{favourite}} or least favourite author according to their age, and argues that her books create an [...] "encapsulated world for young readers that simply dissolves with age, leaving behind only memories of excitement and strong identification". Fred Inglis considers Blyton's books to be technically easy to read, but to also be [...] "emotionally and cognitively easy". He mentions that the psychologist Michael Woods believed that Blyton was different from many other older authors writing for children in that she seemed untroubled by presenting them with a world that differed from reality. Woods surmised that Blyton [...] "was a child, she thought as a child, and wrote as a child... the basic feeling is essentially pre-adolescent... Enid Blyton has no moral dilemmas... Inevitably Enid Blyton was labelled by rumour a child-hater. If true, such a fact <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> no surprise to us, for as a child herself all other children can be nothing but rivals for her." [...] Inglis argues though that Blyton was clearly devoted to children and put {{an enormous amount of}} energy into her work, with a powerful belief in [...] "representing the crude moral diagrams and garish fantasies of a readership". Blyton's daughter Imogen has stated that she [...] "loved a relationship with children through her books", but real children were an intrusion, and {{there was no room for}} intruders in the world that Blyton occupied through her writing.|$|E

On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno she explained that Smith inspired her to [...] "whip my hair {{back and forth on}} stage," [...] referring to Smith's similar named song. Gaga continued that the incubating vessel was meant to signify an artistic statement of birthing a new race with no prejudice. The idea occurred to her when she was in Amsterdam on her tour bus, and was thinking about birth and embryos. She had thought to herself, [...] "Gosh, the thing I hate most about doing award shows is, it can be [...] distracting... I want to exist only for my fans and for the stage. I don't want to exist in this machine or this circus that is the industry. I wish I could be encapsulated for three days and just think only about my performance, think only about the album, think only about the future of my fans. So that's what I did." [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV felt that the {{performance was}} [...] "surprisingly" [...] sparse compared to Gaga's previous [...] "over-the-top" [...] endeavors. Soraya Roberts from New York Daily News was disappointed with the [...] "highly expected" [...] performance, feeling that it had copied Madonna and her Blond Ambition World Tour choreography. Jason Lipscultz from Billboard described the performance as [...] "spirited", and felt that Gaga's appearance inside the egg was one of the memorable moments of the Grammy Awards. Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly praised the performance saying that although there were definite influences of Madonna in it, the performance was {{one of the highlights of}} the show. Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone concurred that [...] "It <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> no surprise that Lady Gaga's performance of her new single 'Born This Way' was the evening's most visually stunning and bizarre spectacle." ...|$|E
