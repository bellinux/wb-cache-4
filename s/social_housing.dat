40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to assess the Norwegian <b>social</b> <b>house</b> {{building}} industry, and identify potential barriers that limit entrepreneurship within the industry. Failure to meet increasing demand of <b>social</b> <b>houses</b> has resulted in continuous criticism of the industry for not reacting to the market. The research conducted {{suggests that there are}} several reasons as to why the industry has failed to meet market demand. From a theoretical perspective, the stakeholders’ inability to understand their respective roles has instituted a situation in which all are making demands, yet unwilling to undertake any responsibility. The theoretical framework is further criticized for being too rigid in its definition of who a social entrepreneur is, and challenged with the author’s understanding of the individual municipal as a social entrepreneur. It is further emphasized that a social entrepreneur is unable to change society without the benefits of social networks. A discussion about social entrepreneurship is therefore greatly limited if not complimented with social networks. In the <b>social</b> <b>house</b> building industry there is a need of allocating responsibility to the individual municipal, empowering these municipals through government regulations, and establishing <b>social</b> <b>houses</b> as an opportunity to relief social suffering. Current practice encumber private social entrepreneurs to participate in the initiating of <b>social</b> <b>house</b> building, and is ultimately having the opposite effect of its intention. Private providers of welfare have been limited in Norway due to fear of potential commercialization that will {{have a negative impact on}} price and services. It therefore is paradoxical that the government’s inability to match supply and demand has had this effect fundamentally associated with private actors...|$|R

40|$|Sustainable {{management}} of <b>social</b> (public) <b>housing</b> estates after their provision is becoming necessary {{in recent years}} due to {{the main purpose of}} meeting cheap, decent and safe housing needs of the citizens, and on the premise that housing is an indispensable human need. Notwithstanding of these, there is evidence that Sustainable <b>Social</b> (Public) <b>Housing</b> Estates Management (SSPHEM) are not being appropriately and successfully practiced. The body of knowledge reveals that the numbers of housing estates were paramount and emphasised by the relevant scholars, rather than, the effective post-construction {{management of}} these estates, for improvement of the <b>social</b> (public) <b>housing</b> estates deplorable conditions and to achieve the benefits of sustainability. The overall aim of this research is to develop a framework for Sustainable <b>Social</b> (Public) <b>Housing</b> Estates Management (SSPHEM) in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. This research aim was attained through a critical literature review and investigation of themes relevant to the objectives: identification of the estate management principles and approaches currently used in the management of <b>social</b> (public) <b>housing</b> estates; identification of the maintenance management types and practices in the total housing estate management; identification of the underpinning concepts in stakeholder’s management and the relevance/ importance of their inclusion in the management; and to conceptualise sustainability in the context of <b>social</b> (public) <b>housing</b> estate management and identify those beneficial sustainability factors for <b>social</b> (public) <b>housing</b> estates. The research has drawn on works in relevant research methodologies, and has taken an interpretative pragmatic stance with an embedded multiple case study, being adopted to perform exploratory and explanatory case studies into the <b>social</b> (public) <b>housing</b> estate post-construction management. Qualitative and quantitative data was collected using 16 Nr) semi-structured interviews, 100 (Nr) questionnaires, documentation and direct observation. The primary data was analysed using NviVo 10 and SPSS 20 packages and interpretive thematic content analysis techniques. An operational SSPHEM framework was developed for the <b>social</b> (public) <b>housing</b> estates that involved the integration of the appropriate: estate management approach; building maintenance approach; relevant stakeholders’ involvement; and the beneficial sustainability factors. Using unsustainable management approaches was the main issue to the current <b>social</b> (public) <b>housing</b> estates incessant deplorable conditions and deficits. The study found that in-house estate management and unplanned maintenance management approaches; non-involvement/inclusion of the relevant stakeholders; and the meagre awareness, consideration, interlocking and integration of the essential and beneficial sustainability factors, were the main features of unsustainable management. The study established fourteen main factors hindering the sustainable housing estate management and maintenance approaches effectiveness. The study established six reasons for non-stakeholders involvement and seven essential and beneficial sustainability factors for the benefits of sustainability in the <b>social</b> (public) <b>housing</b> estate. The study found that effective and sufficient awareness, understanding, identification and assessment of the appropriate drivers within each theme, and a requirement for stronger correlation amongst the drivers is vital and assisted in the implementation of the operational SSPHEM framework. Operationalising the developed SSPHEM framework suggested strategies, that in itself should ensure improvements in the current <b>social</b> (public) <b>housing</b> estates qualities and conditions and would reduce shortages, with significant benefits appreciation. The framework enhances: monitoring; evaluation; and reporting; on <b>social</b> (public) <b>housing</b> estate performances and sustainability, providing information on areas needing enhancement. The SSPHEM framework is an effective instrument for the end-users of the framework for the <b>social</b> (public) <b>housing</b> estates post-construction management, and can be adopted in other regions of Nigeria, and developing and developed countries in the world over. The research endorsed that sustainable <b>social</b> (public) <b>housing</b> estate post-construction management should be achieved by users of the framework, being willing to make a sustainable change to the legal, cultural, financial/economic, social and political regulations to the practices of the current management approaches. Studying the relevant sustainability assessment toolkits and testing the developed SSPHEM framework, strengthens the sustainability of the framework purpose achievement. Federal and State Governments Housing Authorities staff capacity, training and research and development should encourage innovative and proactive practices for the effective performance and improvement in <b>social</b> (public) <b>housing</b> estates post-construction management...|$|R

5|$|The older houses relied {{mainly on}} heating from open coal fires, {{which led to}} {{problems}} with smog (in 1962, 24 deaths in Leeds were attributed to this), although this problem was partially relieved in the 1950s {{with the introduction of}} the Clean Air Act 1956. Although a slum clearance scheme was under way in the 1930s, it took until after the Second World War, for the scheme to get well under way. In the 1950s, the largest <b>social</b> <b>housing</b> project began with the building of the Seacroft Estate. Seacroft was planned at the time to be a 'Satellite town within the city limits'. The building of new council estates was most prevalent in the city's east end and because of this the city expanded much further East {{in the latter part of}} the 20th century then it did any other direction. The Langbar Gardens Estate (completed 1966) in Swarcliffe lay right on the eastern fringes of the city sprawl until it was demolished in the early 21st century, including the high-profile implosions of Langbar Towers, Langbar Grange and Ash Tree Grange. By the 1960s and 1970s land for <b>social</b> <b>housing</b> was becoming scarcer and the council started looking towards building 'high rise', with such estates as Cottingley sporting prominent tower blocks. By the 1970s less land was available for such developments and the particularly large estates were becoming unpopular, however faced with a need for a larger <b>social</b> <b>housing</b> stock, Leeds City Council built smaller estates such as Holt Park (in partnership with Norman Ashton), replaced the prefabricated 'war houses' in Cottingley with newer prefabs and redeveloped areas such as Beckhill in Meanwood.|$|E
