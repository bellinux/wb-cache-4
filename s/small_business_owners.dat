5|$|Six {{months after}} he took office, the FBI raided his office and homes for {{allegedly}} extorting money from <b>small</b> <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> in his district. Shortly after the raid, the city attorney began investigating Jew for violating residency requirements necessary to hold his supervisor position. In September 2007, he was suspended by Mayor Gavin Newsom and later resigned {{in the face of}} extortion and perjury charges. In late 2008, he pleaded guilty to both charges. He was sentenced to 64months in federal prison for extortion, and a year in county jail for perjury.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the Western Australia state government allocated relief funds to offset the cost of recovery and clean-up in several of the affected towns. Individuals and families became eligible to apply for personal grants and <b>small</b> <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> would be considered for special interest rates on new loans. Local government entities listed under the proclamation were the shires of Ashburton, Broome, East Pilbara, Meekatharra, and the Town of Port Hedland. Disaster assistance money in these jurisdictions would be used to restore public assets and infrastructure impaired by the storm.

5|$|The College of Business is a {{professional}} school consisting of six departments with undergraduate concentrations in each, plus the Miller School of Entrepreneurship and a Master of Business Administration and Master of Science in Accounting program. The college's beginnings came in 1936 when the Department of Commerce was organized. It later changed to the Department of Business Education, {{and then to the}} Department of Business. Finally, in 1960, the School of Business was formed. The college undergraduate program was accredited in 1967, and the graduate program was accredited in 1976 by The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. The college is a governing school of the Graduate Management Admission Council. The college runs a Small Business Institute to advise <b>small</b> <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> on how to succeed.|$|E

25|$|With its {{election}} of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 and its success in guiding the Union to victory and abolishing slavery, the party came {{to dominate the}} national political scene until 1932. The Republican Party was based on northern white Protestants, businessmen, <b>small</b> <b>business</b> <b>owners,</b> professionals, factory workers, farmers and African Americans. It was pro-business, supporting banks, the gold standard, railroads and high tariffs to protect factory workers and grow industry faster. Under William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, it emphasized an expansive foreign policy.|$|E
25|$|The {{preceding}} {{months before}} the GST became active saw a spike in consumption as consumers rushed to purchase goods that they perceived would be substantially more expensive with the GST. Once the tax came into effect, consumer consumption and economic growth declined such that by the first fiscal quarter of 2001, the Australian economy recorded negative economic growth {{for the first time}} in more than 10 years. Consumption soon returned to normal however. The Government was criticised by <b>small</b> <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> over the increased administrative responsibilities of submitting Business Activity Statements (BAS) on a quarterly basis to the Australian Taxation Office.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the earliest groups of Indians who entered the US workforce as taxi drivers, labourers, farmers or <b>small</b> <b>business</b> <b>owners,</b> the later arrivals often came as professionals or completed graduate study in the US and moved into the professions. They have become very successful financially thanks to the hi-tech industry, and are thus probably the most well-off community of immigrants. They are well represented in all walks of life, but particularly so in academia, information technology and medicine. There were over 4,000 PIO professors and 84,000 Indian-born students in American universities in 2007-08. The American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin has a membership of 35,000. In 2000, Fortune magazine estimated the wealth generated by Indian Silicon Valley entrepreneurs at around $250 billion.|$|E
25|$|As {{the centre}} of trade gravitated towards Amsterdam, Haarlem {{declined}} in the 18th century. The Golden age had created a large upper middle class of merchants and well-to-do <b>small</b> <b>business</b> <b>owners.</b> Taking advantage of {{the reliability of the}} trekschuit connection between Amsterdam and Haarlem, many people had a business address in Amsterdam and a weekend or summer home in Haarlem. Haarlem became more and more a bedroom community as the increasingly dense population of Amsterdam caused the canals to smell in the summer. Many well-to-do gentlemen moved their families to summer homes in the Spring and commuted between addresses. Popular places for summer homes were along the Spaarne in southern Haarlem. Pieter Teyler van der Hulst and Henry Hope built summer homes there, as well as many Amsterdam merchants and councilmen. Today, it is still possible to travel by boat along the Spaarne and this has turned into a popular form of tourism in the summer months. In the 18th century Haarlem became the seat of a suffragan diocese of the Old Catholic Church of Utrecht.|$|E
25|$|Indians also entered Australia in {{the first}} half of the 20th century when both Australia and India were still British colonies. Indian Sikhs came to work on the banana {{plantations}} in Southern Queensland. Today a large number of them live in the town of Woolgoolga (a town lying roughly halfway between Sydney and Brisbane). Some of these Indians, the descendants of Sikh plantation workers, now own banana farms in the area. There are two Sikh temples in Woolgoolga, one of which has a museum dedicated to Sikhism. A large number of Britons and Anglo-Indians born in India migrated to Australia after 1947. These British citizens decided to settle in Australia in large numbers but are still counted as Indian Nationals in the census. The third wave of Indians entered the country in the 1980s. After the policy was abolished many Indian teachers and doctors settled in Australia. Another big influx began with the information technology (IT) revolution. Large numbers of Indian IT professionals arrived in Australia from 1976 onwards. After successive military coups in Fiji of 1987 and 2000, a significant number of Fijian-Indians migrated to Australia as such there is a large Fijian-Indian population in Australia. Fijian-Indians have significantly changed the character of the Indian community in Australia. While most earlier Indian migration was by educated professionals, the Fijian-Indian community was also largely by professionals but also brought many <b>small</b> <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> and entrepreneurs.|$|E

500|$|In these investigations, Bedell quickly {{gained the}} support of small {{gasoline}} marketers and Congressman Bill Nelson. The chief target, ARCO, was accused of not paying all of its taxes on Alaskan crude oil. In the end, the government {{tried to make a}} case against ARCO, but it was eventually dropped in 1985. Bedell used this opportunity to attack the Administration for [...] "not caring" [...] about <b>small</b> <b>business</b> <b>owners,</b> and he advocated that Governmental agencies put aside 1-3% of their research and development money for small businesses.|$|E
