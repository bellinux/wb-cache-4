The challenges are directly linked to the peak power consumption of servers. Our solution, Power Shifting, reduces the peak power consumption of servers minimizing the impact on performance. We reduce peak power consumption by using workload-guided dynamic allocation of power among components incorporating real-time performance feedback, activity-related power estimation techniques, and performance-sensitive activity-regulation mechanisms to enforce power budgets. We apply our techniques to a computer system with a single processor and memory. Power shifting adds a system power manager with a dynamic, global view of the system’s power consumption to continuously re-budget the available power amongst the two components.

40|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 1980 's there was a drastic decline in the number of {{monograph}} acquisitions in academic libraries in the United States. The overriding cause of this decline was the escalation in serials prices which began in the 1970 s and accelerated in the 1980 s until serial subscriptions had gobbled up the monographs budget and any other funds that could be diverted from other lines into serial subscription payments.

40|$|We {{develop a}} model of optimal consumption, labor and {{portfolio}} choice with endogenous retirement for an individual's life-cycle decisions. Explicit solutions for finite horizon are derived both for an individual with power utility and for an individual with log utility. There are two distinct phases in the life-cycle, the first being accumulation phase and the second being retirement phase. The individual simultaneously chooses consumption, labor, portfolio and whether to retire so as to maximize the expected utility. We show that the dynamic budget constraint {{can be reduced to}} a <b>static</b> <b>budget</b> constraint. For this static optimization problem involving both stochastic optimal control and optimal stopping, we use the convex duality approach to transform it to a pure optimal stopping problem. The value function can be characterized using early exercise premium representation which depends on the optimal retirement boundary. We show that immediate retirement is optimal when a state variable hits the boundary. We derive the backward recursive equation of the boundary parameterized by a multiplier which itself satisfies a nonlinear equation from the <b>static</b> <b>budget</b> constraint. The optimal wealth and the optimal portfolio are derived and they depend on the retirement boundary and the derivative of this boundary with respect to the multiplier. A numerical algorithm is developed for computation of the solutions. We analyze the properties and the structures of the optimal policies and also prove that retirement is optimal when the financial wealth crosses its boundary of which we derive an explicit form. We study next {{a model of}} optimal dividend-contribution, portfolio and liquidation from the viewpoint of a defined benefit pension fund. The sponsor faces a stream of intermediate liability and a terminal liability. The optimization problem stops at the optimal liquidation date rather than continues for the second phase.

More recently, idealized model simulations of the tropics indicate that the moist <b>static</b> energy <b>budget</b> is dominated by advection, with shallow inflow in the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere with outflow concentrated about 10 km above the surface.

30|$|There are two {{possible}} explanations for this counterintuitive observation. The simplest explanation is that {{to the extent that}} economic resources impact Internet adoption, GDP per capita by PPP also indicates the individual ability to participate in the market as an Internet user. As noted earlier in this section, adoption may lead to higher volume of spam and percentage of spambots. A second, more tenuous, behavioral explanation is that as GDP per capita by PPP increases, adoption of legal software as well as anti-malware technologies is proportionally impinged. However, individuals compensate for risk mitigating technologies by demonstrating higher risk behavior. There is evidence for such <b>static</b> risk <b>budgets</b> offline. For example, the introduction of ABS did not reduce overall risk as drivers compensated by driving closer to other vehicles [65]. Both these hypotheses can be tested by replacing GDP per capita by PPP with more direct measures of economic resources such rates of software copyright infringement and market penetration of anti-virus software. While statistics for copyright infringement are readily available from Business Software Alliance, similar data for market penetration of security technologies is admittedly harder to acquire.|$|R
40|$|Eastward {{propagation}} of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) detours the Maritime Continent (MC) region southward during austral summer, exhibiting enhanced convective activity preferentially {{in the southern}} part of the MC area with much weaker anomalies in the central MC area. Column-integrated moist <b>static</b> energy <b>budget</b> of the MJO is analyzed to understand the processes responsible for the MJO detouring. Results show that zonal and meridional moisture advection is the essential process to the MJO detouring, causing the difference between the southern and central MC regions in the moisture recharge before and during the MJO onset. Further analysis reveals that moisture advection by MJO perturbation winds acting upon the background moisture gradient has the dominant contribution to the regional contrast between the central and southern MC areas. The zonal moisture advection is greater in the southern MC region because the zonal gradient of the background moisture field is much steeper in the southern MC area than in the central MC area. The onset of the Australian monsoon in austral summer contributes to the establishment of the sharp zonal moisture gradient in the southern MC region. The meridional moisture advection is weaker in the central MC area because meridional wind anomalies associated with the MJO vary regionally, presumably through interactions with the topography and land-sea contrast. clos...|$|R

A 100 -day simulation is performed with a three-dimensional cloud-resolving model over a (576 km) 2 domain with no ambient rotation and no mean wind. The convection self-aggregates within 10 days into quasi-stationary mesoscale patches of dry, subsiding and moist, rainy air columns. The patches ultimately merge {{into a single}} intensely convecting moist patch surrounded by a broad region of very dry subsiding air. The self-aggregation is analyzed as an instability of a horizontally homogeneous convecting atmosphere driven by convection–water vapor–radiation feedbacks that systematically dry the drier air columns and moisten the moister air columns. Column-integrated heat, water, and moist <b>static</b> energy <b>budgets</b> over (72 km) 2 horizontal blocks show that this instability is primarily initiated by the reduced radiative cooling of air columns {{in which there is}} extensive anvil cirrus, augmented by enhanced surface latent and sensible heat fluxes under convectively active regions due to storm-induced gustiness.

The regions of anomalous descent neighboring the warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies {{in the eastern}} and central Pacific Ocean during the 1997 / 98 El Niño are used as an example, and results are verified for three other El Niño warm events (1982, 1987, and 1991). By analyzing the moisture and moist <b>static</b> energy <b>budgets</b> over these regions, {{it is found that}} the physical processes responsible for the descent anomalies are different for each region. Anomalous dry advection is the dominant mechanism for the reduced precipitation {{to the north of the}} El Niño warm region. On the other hand, the relative descent to the south of the El Niño warm SSTs is caused by reduced surface wind speed and reduced air–sea contrast and resulting weaker than normal evaporation. Budget analysis based on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Seasonal-to-Interannual Prediction Project atmospheric general circulation model simulations is consistent with the QTCM results. Radiative cooling associated with the warming of tropospheric temperature is relatively small, on the order of a few watts per square meter. The traditional assumption that compensating subsidence is caused by radiative cooling due to increased tropospheric temperature thus does not apply in this context.

Here {{the sensitivity of}} the zonal-mean circulation to reduced air-sea momentum roughness (Z 0 m) at low flow speed is investigated with the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM 3). In an aquaplanet framework with prescribed sea surface temperatures, the response to reduced Z 0 m resembles the La Niña minus El Niño response to El Niño Southern Oscillation variability with: i) a poleward shift of the mid-latitude westerlies extending {{all the way to the}} surface; ii) a weak poleward shift of the subtropical descent region; and iii) a weakening of the Hadley circulation, which is generally also accompanied by a poleward shift of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and the tropical surface easterlies. Mechanism-denial experiments show this response to be initiated by the reduction of tropical latent and sensible heat fluxes, effected by reducing Z 0 m. The circulation response is elucidated by considering the effect of the tropical energy fluxes on the Hadley circulation strength, the upper tropospheric critical layer latitudes, and the lower-tropospheric baroclinic eddy forcing. The ITCZ shift is understood via moist <b>static</b> energy <b>budget</b> analysis in the tropics.

A series of aquaplanet simulations exhibit a tripling of intraseasonal outgoing longwave radiation variance as equatorial SST is increased from 268 to 358 C. The simulated intraseasonal variability also transitions from an episodic phenomenon to one with a semiregular period of 25 days. Moist <b>static</b> energy (MSE) <b>budgets</b> of composite MJO events are used to diagnose the physical processes responsible for the relationship with SST. This analysis points to an increasingly positive contribution from vertical advection, associated in part with a steepening of the mean vertical MSE profile in the lower troposphere.

Quantitative budget differences between 2 D and 3 D as well as between various episodes will be detailed. Morover, simulated radar signatures and Q 1 /Q 2 fields from the three simulations are compared to each other and with radar and sounding observations...|$|R
40|$|A cloud-resolving {{model is}} used to {{investigate}} the effect of warming on high percentiles of precipitation (precipitation extremes) in the idealized setting of radiative-convective equilibrium. While this idealized setting {{does not allow for}} several factors that influence precipitation in the tropics, it does allow for an evaluation of the response of precipitation extremes to warming in simulations with resolved rather than parameterized convection. The methodology developed should also be applicable to less idealized simulations. Modeled precipitation extremes are found to increase in magnitude in response to an increase in sea surface temperature. A dry <b>static</b> energy <b>budget</b> {{is used to}} relate the changes in precipitation extremes to changes in atmospheric temperature, vertical velocity, and precipitation efficiency. To first order, the changes in precipitation extremes are captured by changes in the mean temperature structure of the atmosphere. Changes in vertical velocities play a secondary role and tend to weaken the strength of precipitation extremes, despite an intensification of updraft velocities in the upper troposphere. The influence of changes in condensate transports on precipitation extremes is quantified in terms of a precipitation efficiency; it does not change greatly with warming. Tropical precipitation extremes have previously been found to increase at a greater fractional rate than the amount of atmospheric water vapor in observations of present-day variability and in some climate model simulations with parameterized convection. But the fractional increases in precipitation extremes in the cloud-resolving simulations are comparable in magnitude to those in surface water vapor concentrations (owing to a partial cancellation between dynamical and thermodynamical changes), and are substantially less than the fractional increases in column water vapor. 1...|$|R
