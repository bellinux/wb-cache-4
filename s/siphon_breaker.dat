40|$|An {{innovative}} integrated {{passive safety}} {{system for a}} research reactor is proposed in this study to improve {{the safety of the}} research reactor. This integrated system has three functions in the facility as a decay tank, <b>siphon</b> <b>breaker,</b> and long-term cooling tank. This paper also deals with the process of designing and optimizing the decay tank and the <b>siphon</b> <b>breaker</b> of the integrated passive safety system. At first, the decay tank was designed and improved step by step, while considering the computational fluid dynamics analysis results. Consequently, we could satisfy the design requirements of the decay tank. In addition, the performance of a new type of <b>siphon</b> <b>breaker</b> that was installed in the final decay tank model was tested. We designed an 18 -inch diameter <b>siphon</b> <b>breaker</b> {{at the top of the}} decay tank’s third section, and we could observe the breaking of the siphon that prevented the occurrence of a severe accident in the research reactor. By locating the <b>siphon</b> <b>breaker</b> at the third section of the decay tank, we could also use the coolant of the front three sections for long-term cooling of the research reactor...|$|E
40|$|To {{ensure the}} safety of {{research}} reactors, the water level must be maintained above the required height. When a pipe ruptures, the siphon phenomenon causes continuous loss of coolant until the hydraulic head is removed. To protect the reactor core from this kind of accident, a <b>siphon</b> <b>breaker</b> has been suggested as a passive safety device. This study mainly focused on two variables: the size of the pipe rupture and the timing of air entrainment. In this study, the size of the pipe rupture was increased to the guillotine break case. There was a region in which a larger pipe rupture did not need a larger <b>siphon</b> <b>breaker,</b> and the water flow rate was related {{to the size of the}} pipe rupture and affected the residual water quantity. The timing of air entrainment was predicted to influence residual water level. However, the residual water level was not affected by the timing of air entrainment. The experimental cases, which showed the characteristic of partical sweep-out mode in the separation of siphon breaking phenomenon [2], showed almost same trend of physical properties...|$|E
40|$|A {{postulated}} {{loss of coolant accident}} (LOCA) {{shall be}} analyzed {{to assure the}} safety of a research reactor. The analysis of such accident could be performed using best estimate thermal-hydraulic codes, such as RELAP 5. This study focuses on analysis of LOCA in TRIGA- 2000 due to pipe and beam tube break. The objective is to understand the effect of break size and the actuating time of the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) on the accident consequences and to assess the safety of the reactor. The analysis is performed using RELAP/SCDAPSIM codes. Three different break size and actuating time were studied. The results confirmed that the larger break size, the faster coolant blow down. But, the siphon break holes could prevent the core from risk of dry out due to siphoning effect in case of pipe break. In case of beam tube rupture, the ECCS is able to delay the fuel temperature increased where the late actuation of the ECCS could delay longer. It could be concluded that the safety of the reactor is kept during LOCA throughout the duration time studied. However, to assure the integrity of the fuel for the long term, the cooling system after ECCS last should be considered.   Keywords: safety analysis, LOCA, TRIGA, RELAP 5   STUDI PARAMETRIK LOCA DI TRIGA- 2000 MENGGUNAKAN RELAP 5 /SCDAP. Kecelakaan kehilangan air pendingin (LOCA) harus dianalisis untuk menjamin keselamatan suatu reaktor riset. Analisis LOCA dapat dilakukan menggunakan perhitungan best-estimate seperti RELAP 5. Penelitian ini menekankan pada analisis LOCA di TRIGA- 2000 akibat pecahnya pipa dan tabung berkas. Tujuan penelitian adalah memahami efek ukuran kebocoran dan waktu aktuasi sistem pendingin teras darurat (ECCS) pada sekuensi kejadian dan mengkaji keselamatan reaktor. Analisis dilakukan menggunakan program perhitungan RELAP/SCDAPSIM. Tiga ukuran kebocoran dan waktu aktuasi ECCS berbeda dipilih sebagai parameter dalam studi ini.   Hasil perhitungan mengonfirmasi bahwa semakin besar ukuran kebocoran, semakin cepat pengosongan tangki reaktor. Lubang <b>siphon</b> <b>breaker</b> dapat mencegah air terkuras dalam hal kebocoran pada pipa. Sedang dalam hal kebocoran pada beam tube, ECCS mampu memperlambat kenaikan temperatur bahan bakar. Dari studi ini dapat disimpulkan bahwa keselamatan reaktor dapat terjaga pada kejadian LOCA, namun pendinginan jangka panjang perlu dipertimbangkan untuk menjaga integritas bahan bakar.
