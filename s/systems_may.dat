5|$|The Spinozistic {{conception}} of a conatus was a historical precursor to modern theories of autopoiesis in biological systems. In systems theory and the sciences in general, {{the concept of a}} conatus {{may be related to the}} phenomenon of emergence, whereby complex <b>systems</b> <b>may</b> spontaneously form from multiple simpler structures. The self-regulating and self-maintaining properties of biological and even social <b>systems</b> <b>may</b> thus be considered modern versions of Spinoza's conatus principle; however, the scope of the idea is definitely narrower today without the religious implications of the earlier variety.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{reactions}} involved in Bynesian decay require a certain quantity of {{moisture in the}} air {{in order for them to}} take place, keeping the air somewhat dry, i.e. keeping the environmental relative humidity under control is beneficial. This is achieved by careful monitoring of the relative humidity (using instruments such as a hygrometer), and applying dehumidifiers when necessary; sometimes, simple air conditioning <b>systems</b> <b>may</b> suffice. Extremely low humidity can damage some specimens, so caution is recommended. Usually, a relative humidity maintained around 50% is considered to be adequate. Applying sorbents containing a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide, inside the storage environment to protect the specimens against degradation is also possible. Copy paper or KOH-impregnated filter paper are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used. These strong bases have a preference to react with acid, thus they compete successfully with the calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present. The bases also help reduce the overall acid concentration inside the enclosed space.|$|E

5|$|Environmental hazards {{induced by}} humans also puts {{sirenians}} at risk. Sirenians, especially the West Indian manatee, face high mortality from watercraft collision, {{and about half}} of all West Indian manatee deaths are caused by watercraft collisions. An increased usage of hydroelectric power and subsequent damming of rivers increase waterway traffic, which can lead to vessel collisions, and manatees may become entangled in navigational locks. The urbanized coastline of areas such as the Caribbean and Australia can result in the decline of seagrass populations. Reliable areas of warm water in Florida are generally the result of discharge from power plants, but newer plants with more efficient cooling <b>systems</b> <b>may</b> disrupt the pattern of warm water refuges, and an increased demand for artesian springs for water, the natural source of warm water, decreases the number of warm water refuges. Sirenians can be caught as bycatch from fisheries, and they can be seen as pests with the interference of local fishermen and the destruction of their nets. African manatees have also been known to venture into rice paddies and destroy the crops during the rainy season, and these confrontations with locals may lead to intentional culling of the manatees.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the USMC was {{studying}} potential enhancements {{to keep the}} AV-8B Harrier IIs up to date until its planned retirement, such as a helmet-mounted cueing system. It is also predicted that additional work on the aircraft's radars and sensor <b>systems</b> <b>may</b> take place. The USMC's Harrier II fleet was planned to remain in service until 2030, owing to delays with the F-35B {{and the fact that}} the Harriers have more service life left than USMC F/A-18 Hornets. However, by 2014 the USMC had decided to retire the AV-8B sooner because changing the transition orders of Harrier II and Hornet fleets to the Lightning II would save $1billion. After entering service in the mid-2010s, the F-35B will start to replace the AV-8B in 2016, with the AV-8B expected to continue service until 2025. Meanwhile, the AV-8B will receive revamped defensive measures, updated data-link capability and targeting sensors, and improved missiles and rockets, among other enhancements.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{electrical}} plant {{construction and}} well drilling cost about €2–5million perMW of electrical capacity, while the break–even price is 0.04–0.10€ perkW·h. Enhanced geothermal systems {{tend to be}} on the high side of these ranges, with capital costs above $4million perMW and break–even above $0.054 perkW·h in 2007. Direct heating applications can use much shallower wells with lower temperatures, so smaller systems with lower costs and risks are feasible. Residential geothermal heat pumps with a capacity of 10kilowatt (kW) are routinely installed for around $1–3,000 perkilowatt. District heating <b>systems</b> <b>may</b> benefit from economies of scale if demand is geographically dense, as in cities and greenhouses, but otherwise piping installation dominates capital costs. The capital cost of one such district heating system in Bavaria was estimated at somewhat over 1million€ perMW. Direct systems of any size are much simpler than electric generators and have lower maintenance costs perkW·h, but they must consume electricity to run pumps and compressors. Some governments subsidize geothermal projects.|$|E

5|$|Many {{classification}} {{systems have}} been developed {{in an effort to}} predict difficulty of tracheal intubation, including the Cormack-Lehane classification system, the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS), and the Mallampati score. The Mallampati score is drawn from the observation that the size of the base of the tongue influences the difficulty of intubation. It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the mouth, and in particular the visibility of the base of palatine uvula, faucial pillars and the soft palate. Although such medical scoring <b>systems</b> <b>may</b> aid in the evaluation of patients, no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only those patients who are difficult to intubate. Furthermore, one study of experienced anesthesiologists, on the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system, found they did not score the same patients consistently over time, and that only 25% could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system. Under certain emergency circumstances (e.g., severe head trauma or suspected cervical spine injury), it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation. In such cases, alternative techniques of securing the airway must be readily available.|$|E
5|$|Municipalities in Rhode Island can {{incorporate}} as a town or city {{by a special}} act of the state legislature {{and there is no}} minimum population requirement. Eight municipalities were reincorporated as cities operating under a charter, while the other thirtyone remain as towns which perform similar services. Since Rhode Island has no county level of government, cities and towns provide services commonly performed by county governments in other states. Rhode Island's cities and towns may adopt one of four different forms of government: councilmanager, mayorcouncil, town counciltown meeting, or administratorcouncil. The primary difference between these forms of government is how the chief executive is selected. The Councilmanager system involves an elected council who exercise overall control of the local government and a chief executive termed city or town manager who is generally appointed by and responsible to the council for the administration of local policies. Councilmanager <b>systems</b> <b>may</b> elect a mayor but they have no formal administrative functions with the potential exception of a degree of veto power. Mayorcouncil systems have a similarly elected council however the mayor is elected and yields administrative power. In the town counciltown meeting system, there is no fulltime chief executive. There are no towns or cities in Rhode Island that use the administratorcouncil form of government.|$|E
5|$|The 1804 Antigua–Charleston {{hurricane}} {{was first}} sighted on 3September as it swept past Saint Barthélemy, Saint Kitts, and Antigua, drifting toward the west-northwest and soon approaching Puerto Rico and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The storm reached the Bahamas while turning northward on 4September, nearing the northern Floridan coast by 6September. It remained offshore on 7September, gradually approaching the coast throughout the day, and eventually made landfall that evening along {{the coasts of}} Georgia and South Carolina. Observations in Savannah, Georgia, indicated north-to-northeast winds throughout 8September, though other reports recorded northeast-to-easterly gusts; at Charleston, South Carolina, however, winds, initially northeast-to-east, curved southeastward later in the storm. Little information exists on the hurricane's whereabouts between North Carolina and New England, with a single report at Norfolk, Virginia of east-northeasterly winds veering east-to-east-southeast from 7to 9September, suggesting the disturbance's passage west of there. A severe gale arrived in New England on 11and 12September, though the long pause between {{the departure of the}} hurricane from the Carolinas and its arrival in the northeastern United States evidences the possibility that the two <b>systems</b> <b>may</b> have been unrelated.|$|E
