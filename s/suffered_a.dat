Most people also accept a position he calls the Second Standard View (SSV), which holds, roughly, that an outcome where a number of people <b>suffer</b> <b>an</b> extremely severe burden would be worse than one where any number of people <b>suffer</b> <b>a</b> minor burden. For example, most believe that, other things equal, an outcome in which ten people are severely tortured for their entire lives would be worse than an outcome in which any number of people must listen to a mildly unpleasant pop tune.|$|R
