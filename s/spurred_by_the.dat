5|$|Ayer {{has been}} a major {{railroad}} interchange since the Fitchburg Railroad opened through South Groton in 1845, followed by the Stony Brook Railroad, Worcester and Nashua Railroad, and Peterborough and Shirley Railroad in 1848. The original depot was replaced with a union station with a large trainshed in 1848. Land speculation and industrial development <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> railroad access expanded the tiny farm village into the independent town of Ayer.|$|E
5|$|Minneapolis is {{the largest}} city by {{population}} in the U.S. state of Minnesota, and the county seat of Hennepin County. The origin and growth {{of the city was}} <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> proximity of Fort Snelling, the first major United States military presence in the area, and by its location on Saint Anthony Falls, which provided power for sawmills and flour mills.|$|E
5|$|While {{residents}} {{along the}} NY63 corridor {{are against the}} increased truck traffic along the corridor (<b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> North American Free Trade Agreement), most of those same residents, along with other groups, also fought the proposed expressway. The general consensus {{of all of these}} groups is that NYSDOT should impose restrictions on the NY63 corridor and force trucks to remain on I-390 and the Thruway to travel between Buffalo and Pennsylvania.|$|E

50|$|January 14, 2017: The Phoenix Suns {{would end}} their stint in Mexico City with a 1-1 record by losing 113-108 to the Dallas Mavericks, but {{surprisingly}} beating <b>the</b> San Antonio <b>Spurs</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> final score of 108-105; Devin Booker would record 39 points in both games during that trip.|$|R
50|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> {{reign of}} James I boots had {{replaced}} shoes {{as the most}} popular footwear among the upper classes who often wore them indoors, even with <b>spurs.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> 1620s they resembled <b>the</b> boots worn <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Three Musketeers, with a flared bucket-shaped top and high wooden heels similar to those on cowboy boots.|$|R
5|$|Born into a Fang family, Aubame was {{orphaned}} {{at a young}} age. He {{was raised}} by the stepbrother of Léon M'ba, who became Aubame's chief political rival. Encouraged by his colleagues, Aubame entered politics, serving as Gabon's first representative in the National Assembly of France from 1946 to 1958. Aubame was also a leader in solving African problems, particularly developing the Gabonese standard of living and planning urban sites. Aubame's quick rise in Gabonese politics was <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> support of the missions and administration, whereas much of M'ba's strength came from the colonists.|$|E
5|$|Congressional {{interest}} and public pressure for greater air pollution regulation had existed since {{the signing of}} the 1963 Clean Air Act, the first federal legislation on the issue, but further action had been opposed by members of Congress who believed responsibility for air regulation properly lay with the states, not the federal government. Partly in response to the added public pressure <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> smog event, Congress passed and Johnson signed the 1967 Air Quality Act, which amended the 1963 Clean Air Act to provide for study of air quality and control methods.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{developments}} in the military sphere during the Late Middle Ages was {{the increased use of}} infantry and light cavalry. The English also employed longbowmen, but other countries were unable to create similar forces with the same success. Armour continued to advance, <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> increasing power of crossbows, and plate armour was developed to protect soldiers from crossbows as well as the hand-held guns that were developed. Pole arms reached new prominence with the development of the Flemish and Swiss infantry armed with pikes and other long spears.|$|E
50|$|Fame is the Spur is a British {{television}} series which first aired on the BBC in 1982. It {{was based on}} the novel Fame Is <b>the</b> <b>Spur</b> <b>by</b> Howard Spring. It depicts a socialist politician who betrays his early beliefs as he grows older, and was believed to be based upon the Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. It had previously been adapted as a film Fame Is <b>the</b> <b>Spur</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Boulting Brothers in 1947.|$|R
50|$|A {{truncated}} spur is a spur, {{which is}} a ridge that descends towards a valley floor or coastline from a higher elevation, that ends in an inverted-V face and was produced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> erosional truncation of <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> action of either streams, waves, or glaciers. Truncated spurs can be found within mountains, along the walls of river valleys, or along coastlines.|$|R
50|$|Beach Haven West {{was built}} in phases, the first opening in 1957. The first phase {{contained}} the lagoons and cul-de-sacs branching between Morris Boulevard and Jennifer Lane. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> early 1960s, the second phase was completed, this one spanning between Jonathan Drive and Walter Boulevard. Afterwords, the third phase was completed, which contained the development along Mill Creek Road between Route 72 and Jonathan Drive, as well as <b>the</b> Charles Boulevard <b>spur.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, the lagoon-front community was expanded down Mill Creek Road towards East Point.|$|R
5|$|The {{occurrence}} of planktonic foraminifera across the K–Pg boundary {{has been studied}} since the 1930s. Research <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> possibility of an impact event at the K–Pg boundary resulted in numerous publications detailing planktonic foraminiferal extinction at the boundary, however, there is debate ongoing between groups that think the evidence indicates substantial extinction of these species at the K–Pg boundary, and those who think the evidence supports multiple extinctions and expansions through the boundary.|$|E
5|$|The {{planning}} {{of the metro}} was <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> development of the Ørestad area of Copenhagen. The principle of building a rail transit {{was passed by the}} Parliament of Denmark on 24 June 1992, with the Ørestad Act. The responsibility for developing the area, as well as building and operating the metro, was given to the Ørestad Development Corporation, a joint venture between Copenhagen Municipality (45%) and the Ministry of Finance (55%). Initially, three modes were considered: a tramway, a light rail and a rapid transit. In October 1994, the Development Corporation chose a light rapid transit.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{struggle with}} the See of Rome continued through the Macedonian period, <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> question of religious supremacy over the newly Christianised state of Bulgaria. Ending eighty years of peace between the two states, the powerful Bulgarian tsar Simeon I invaded in 894 but was pushed back by the Byzantines, who used their fleet to sail up the Black Sea to attack the Bulgarian rear, enlisting {{the support of the}} Hungarians. The Byzantines were defeated at the Battle of Boulgarophygon in 896, however, and agreed to pay annual subsidies to the Bulgarians.|$|E

5|$|Zahorchak {{announced}} he would resign as education secretary on May 7, 2010. His decision to leave was <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pending end of the Rendell administration, with the governor leaving the office by January 2011. At {{the time of his}} departure, there were no public school districts in the state with more than half of their students testing below basic levels in state standardized tests, although 14 districts fit that criterion before Zahorchak took the job.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century {{there was}} a surge in {{historical}} interest in the Peasants' Revolt, <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> contemporary growth of the labour and socialist movements. Work by Charles Oman, Edgar Powell, André Réville and G. M. Trevelyan established the course of the revolt. By 1907 the accounts of the chroniclers were all widely available in print and the main public records concerning the events had been identified. Réville began to use the legal indictments that had been used against suspected rebels after the revolt as a fresh source of historical information, and over the next century extensive research was carried out into the local economic and social history of the revolt, using scattered local sources across south-east England.|$|E
5|$|Between 1937 and 1938, Bishop {{studied the}} effects of various factors, {{including}} different substances in blood and different temperatures, on the feeding behaviour of the chicken malaria (Plasmodium gallinaceum) vector, Aedes aegypti. She also examined factors that contributed to Plasmodium reproduction. This work {{became the basis for}} subsequent ongoing research into a malaria vaccine. Her subsequent work was <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> outbreak of the Second World War. During the war, she investigated alternative chemotherapies for malaria. Her research aided the British war effort because the most prevalent antimalarial, quinine, was difficult to obtain due to the Japanese occupation of the Dutch West Indies. From 1947 to 1964, she {{was in charge of the}} Institute's Chemotherapy Research Institute, associated with the Medical Research Council.|$|E

5|$|By 1977, Greene was {{the captain}} of the Steelers defense, {{although}} his reduced effectiveness over the previous two seasons due to injuries led to rumors that he was washed up. He was never again able to attain the same success as a pass rusher after his pinched nerve in 1975. <b>Spurred</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rumors, he returned in 1978 to lead all Pittsburgh linemen in tackles, and he had four sacks and a career-high five fumble recoveries. The Steelers defense allowed a league-low 195 points during the season, en route to a 35–31 victory over the Cowboys in Super Bowl XIII. In that contest, Greene had one of Pittsburgh's five sacks of Dallas quarterback Roger Staubach.|$|E
5|$|During a {{national}} recession from 2001 to 2003, the city lost 28,000 jobs. In response, a development initiative, Vision 2025, promised to incite {{economic growth and}} recreate lost jobs. Projects <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> initiative promised urban revitalization, infrastructure improvement, tourism development, riverfront retail development, and further diversification of the economy. As of 2007, employment levels have surpassed pre-recession heights and the city is in a significant economic development and investment surge. This economic improvement is also seen in Tulsa's housing trends which show an average of a 6% increase in rent in 2010. Since 2006, more than 28,000 jobs {{have been added to}} the city. The unemployment rate of Tulsa in August 2014 was 4.5%.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th century major landowners {{tended to}} rent out their demesne lands for money, {{motivated}} by static prices for produce and {{the chaos of}} the Anarchy between 1135 and 1153. This practice began to alter in the 1180s and 1190s, <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> greater political stability. In the first years of John's reign, agricultural prices almost doubled, at once increasing the potential profits on the demesne estates and also increasing the cost of living for the landowners themselves. Landowners now attempted wherever possible to bring their demesne lands back into direct management, creating a system of administrators and officials to run their new system of estates.|$|E

An unknown knight has won all three contests and is awarded prizes of a sword and golden <b>spurs</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lovely Mechthilde. Count Adelhart and the other beg him to raise his visor to reveal the noble knight. When they see he is Albert von Cleeburg, Count Adelhart is enraged and seeks revenge. Only Rudolf's sword prevents Albert's imprisonment and allows him to escape as the act ends.|$|R
5|$|Marysville {{began to}} grow into a bedroom {{community}} of Seattle and Everett in the late 1950s, <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> completion of Interstate 5 in stages from 1954 to 1969. The new freeway bypassed the town, causing a minor decline in tourist revenue at businesses that later rebounded to normal levels, also eliminating a major traffic bottleneck that paralyzed the city's downtown. The city annexed its first area outside its original city limits in 1954, growing to over 2,500 residents. Marysville was re-classified as a third-class city in 1962 and the local Chamber of Commerce boosted the city during the Century 21 Exposition held in nearby Seattle, hosting a UFO exposition in Smokey Point that summer.|$|E
5|$|Military {{camouflage}} was <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> increasing {{range and}} accuracy of firearms in the 19th century. In particular {{the replacement of the}} inaccurate musket with the rifle made personal concealment in battle a survival skill. In the 20th century, military camouflage developed rapidly, especially during the First World War. On land, artists such as André Mare designed camouflage schemes and observation posts disguised as trees. At sea, merchant ships and troop carriers were painted in dazzle patterns that were highly visible, but designed to confuse enemy submarines as to the target's speed, range, and heading. During and after the Second World War, a variety of camouflage schemes were used for aircraft and for ground vehicles in different theatres of war. The use of radar since the mid-20th century has largely made camouflage for fixed-wing military aircraft obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{envisioned a}} large {{auditorium}} {{of thousands of}} people performing the calculations and passing them to others. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to be completed without the use of computers, {{and the size of the}} grid and time steps led to unrealistic results in deepening systems. It was later found, through numerical analysis, that this was due to numerical instability. The first computerised weather forecast was performed by a team composed of American meteorologists Jule Charney, Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar Fjørtoft, applied mathematician John von Neumann, and ENIAC programmer Klara Dan von Neumann. Practical use of numerical weather prediction began in 1955, <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> development of programmable electronic computers.|$|E

50|$|All along, rent from concerts {{continued}} to increase Gallini's personal fortune. In 1784, Gallini and Elizabeth bought the manors of Hampstead Norreys and Bothampstead from her brother Peregrine, followed in 1785 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> adjacent manor of Yattendon. He also acquired real estate abroad. Money probably also changed hands when {{he was awarded the}} knighthood of the Order of <b>the</b> Golden <b>Spur</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pope in the spring of 1788. He was then popularly styled Sir John Gallini, but English society proved more willing to joke about the title than to recognize it.|$|R
