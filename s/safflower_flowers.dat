Safflower yellow {{is reported to have}} been found in two 8 th- or 9 th-century pieces of samite from Persia, made into a chasuble [46]. However, a sample made with reference safflower yellow did not reproduce a similar chromatogram as shown in the FigureÂ  5 A in a preliminary experiment (unpublished observations). UYD-A may be consisted of safflower yellow and other dyes, or may contain a degraded stage of safflower red dye. Further study is necessary to characterize those components to clearly identify the UYD-A.|$|R
40|$|Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) {{flowers are}} used for {{coloring}} and flavoring food and also as fresh-cut and dried flowers. The most important characteristics which contribute to the ornamental value of <b>safflower</b> are <b>flower</b> color and spinelessness. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the inheritance mode and the number of genes controlling spininess and flower color in some Iranian genotypes of safflower. The results indicated that the existence of spines on the leaves and bracts of safflower is controlled by a single dominant gene in which the spiny phenotype was completely dominant to spineless. In some crosses, flower color was controlled by two epistatic loci each with two alleles, resulting in a ratio of 13 : 3 in the segregating F 2 population for plants with orange and yellow flowers. Also, other mechanisms of genetic control, such as duplicate dominance and duplicat...|$|R
50|$|From spring 2014, {{the entire}} fleet of 15 E3-1000 and E3-2000 series Tsubasa sets is {{scheduled}} to be reliveried in a new colour scheme designed by industrial designer Ken Okuyama. The new colour scheme uses white, evoking the snow of Mount Zao, deep purple inspired by the Mandarin duck, the prefectural bird for Yamagata Prefecture, together with yellow and red for the <b>safflower,</b> the prefectural <b>flower</b> of Yamagata Prefecture. The first reliveried set {{is scheduled to}} appear in late April. Three sets are scheduled to be repainted by June 2014, with the entire fleet of 15 sets repainted by mid 2016.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The safflower, Carthamus tinctorius L., is a {{worldwide}} oil crop, and its flowers, {{which have a}} high flavonoid content, are an important medicinal resource against cardiovascular disease in traditional medicine. Because the safflower has a large and complex genome, the development of its genomic resources has been delayed. Second-generation Illumina sequencing is now an efficient route for generating an enormous volume of sequences that can represent {{a large number of}} genes and their expression levels. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To investigate the genes and pathways that might control flavonoids and other secondary metabolites in the safflower, we used Illumina sequencing to perform a de novo assembly of the <b>safflower</b> tubular <b>flower</b> tissue transcriptome. We obtained a total of 4. 69 Gb in clean nucleotides comprising 52, 119, 104 clean sequencing reads, 195, 320 contigs, and 120, 778 unigenes. Based on similarity searches with known proteins, we annotated 70, 342 of the unigenes (about 58 % of the identified unigenes) with cut-off E-values of 10 (- 5). In total, 21, 943 of the safflower unigenes were found to have COG classifications, and BLAST 2 GO assigned 26, 332 of the unigenes to 1, 754 GO term annotations. In addition, we assigned 30, 203 of the unigenes to 121 KEGG pathways. When we focused on genes identified as contributing to flavonoid biosynthesis and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, which are important pathways that control flower and seed quality, respectively, we found that these genes were fairly well conserved in the safflower genome compared to those of other plants. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides abundant genomic data for Carthamus tinctorius L. and offers comprehensive sequence resources for studying the safflower. We believe that these transcriptome datasets will serve as an important public information platform to accelerate studies of the safflower genome, and may help us define the mechanisms of flower tissue-specific and secondary metabolism in this non-model plant...|$|R
