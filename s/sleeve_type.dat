50|$|The first {{successful}} sleeve valve was patented by Charles Yale Knight, and used twin alternating sliding sleeves. It {{was used in}} some luxury automobiles, notably Willys, Daimler, Mercedes-Benz, Minerva, Panhard, Peugeot and Avions Voisin. Mors adopted double sleeve-valve engines made by Minerva.The higher oil consumption was heavily outweighed by the quietness of running and the very high mileages without servicing. Early poppet-valve systems required decarbonization at very low mileages. The Burt-McCollum sleeve valve was named for the two inventors that applied for similar patents {{within a few weeks}} of each other. The Burt system was an open <b>sleeve</b> <b>type,</b> driven from the crankshaft side, while the McCollum design had a sleeve in the head and upper part of the cylinder, and a more complex port arrangement (Source: 'Torque Meter' Magazine, AEHS). The design that entered production was more 'Burt' than 'McCollum.' It was used by the Scottish company Argyll for its cars, and was later adopted by Bristol for its radial aircraft engines. It used a single sleeve which rotated around a timing axle set at 90 degrees to the cylinder axis. Mechanically simpler and more rugged, the Burt-McCollum valve had the additional advantage of reducing oil consumption (compared to other sleeve valve designs), while retaining the combustion chambers and big, uncluttered, porting area possible in the Knight system.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effects of {{positioning}} and <b>sleeve</b> <b>type</b> bracing on passive position sense of shoulder joints of healthy untrained subjects. Method: A cross over study was carried out on 26 subjects (13 male, 13 female) with a proprioception measurement device. The selected method of testing was passive reproduction of a target angle. Both shoulder joints of all the subjects were evaluated with and without a compressive neoprene <b>sleeve</b> <b>type</b> of brace at two different start positions (45 ˚ internal rotation, 75 ˚external rotation) with an angular rotational movement at a constant speed of 0. 5 /̊s. The angular displacements from the target angles {{at the end of the}} reproduction tests were recorded as position sense deficit scores. Results: The overall mean (SD) deficit score (0. 99 (0. 06)) was significantly (p, 0. 001) lower with the brace than without, and the overall mean deficit score was significantly (p, 0. 001) higher at the 45 ˚ internal rotation start position than at the 75 ˚ external rotation start position. However, there was no significant (p. 0. 05) interaction between brace application and start position. Conclusion: Terminal limits of range of motion facilitate the position sense of shoulder joints. Compressive brace application improves the passive positioning sense possibly by stimulating cutaneous mechanoreceptors. ...|$|E

5000|$|Longevity, as {{demonstrated}} in early automotive applications of the Knight engine. Prior to the advent of leaded gasolines, poppet-valve engines typically required grinding of the valves and valve seats after 20,000 to 30,000 miles (32,000 to 48,000 km) of service. Sleeve valves did not suffer from the wear and recession caused by the repetitive impact of the poppet valve against its seat. Sleeve valves were also subjected to less intense heat build-up than poppet valves, owing to their greater area of contact with other metal surfaces. In the Knight engine, carbon build-up actually helped to improve the sealing of the sleeves, the engines being said to [...] "improve with use", in contrast to poppet valve engines, which lose compression and power as valves, valve stems and guides wear. Due to the continuous motion of the <b>sleeve</b> (Burt-McCollum <b>type),</b> the high wear points linked to poor lubrication in the TDC/BDC (bottom dead centre) of piston travel within the cylinder are suppressed, so rings and cylinders lasted much longer.|$|R

40|$|In Australia, {{the common}} method of {{laboratory}} testing of bolt for load transfer capacity determination is by short encapsulation push testing.

Thus, laboratory testes were carried out to examine the load transfer mechanisms of bolts in both the push and pull conditions. Tests were conducted by shearing a short resin encapsulated bolt out of a cylindrical steel <b>sleeve.</b> Three <b>types</b> of bolts with different surface profile configurations were tested. The study was complemented with numerical simulation of the test methods. Irrespective of bolt type the average shear load and shear stress values were found to be greater in push test, and the displacement at peak shear load was greater in pull test.

50|$|The B21A1 was {{basically}} a re-worked B20A5 {{with an increase in}} bore to 83 mm. The external block dimensions had to stay identical (although there was increased external strengthening and webbing on the B21) to the B20A5 block so Honda called upon Saffil to create a thin but strong cylinder liner called FRM (fiber reinforced metal) which basically consisted of a carbon fiber matrix, aluminum alloy, and aluminum oxide to make a very strong cylinder sleeve. The sleeve is so strong, in fact, that it wears out the piston rings causing low compression numbers, severe smoking, and high oil usage. It is possible in many situations to merely replace the worn rings in order to revive the motor's former output.

40|$|Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess whether the use of staple line reinforcement (SLR) reduces staple line complications (SLC). Mechanical staple lines are essential for gastrointestinal surgery such as bariatric surgery. However, SLC, such as bleeding and leakage, still occur. The purposes of this study were to provide quantitative evidence on the relative efficacy of gastric SLR and to compare the rates of effectiveness of three commonly used methods. Methods A search of the medical literature in English lan-guage journals identified studies from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2013, using the following reinforcement types: (1) no reinforcement, (2) oversewing, (3) a biocompatible glycolide copolymer, and (4) bovine pericardium after gastric bypasses and <b>sleeve</b> gastrectomies. <b>Types</b> of reinforcement were compared using a random-effects model. Results This meta-analysis reviewed 16, 967 articles, extracting data on 56, 309 patients concerning leak and 41, 864 patients concerning bleeding. Over 40 % of patients had no reinforcement, resulting in the highest leak rate (2. 75 %) and bleed rate (3. 45 %). Overall, reinforcing with bovine peri-cardium had the lowest leak (1. 28 %) and bleed (1. 23 %) rates. Suture oversewing was better than no reinforcement but not as effective as bovine pericardium for leak (2. 45 %) and bleed (2. 69 %) rates. Buttressing with a biocompatible glycolide copolymer resulted in the second highest leak rate (2. 61 %) and a bleed rate of 2. 48 % but had significantly lower bleed rates than no reinforcement. Conclusions SLR provided superior results for patients com-pared to no reinforcement for reducing SLC. Buttressing with bovine pericardium resulted in the most favorable outcomes. The effectiveness of different methods used to reinforce the staple line in gastric surgery does not appear to be equal. Keywords Staple lines. Staple line leak. Staple line bleed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The present work is {{concerned}} with the surface finish and the dimensional and geometric (form and orientation) deviations produced after turning and plunge grinding AISI 5115 case hardened steel (58 - 66 HRC). Two grades of mixed alumina tools (coated and uncoated) were tested when face turning one <b>type</b> of gearbox <b>sleeve.</b> A second <b>type</b> of <b>sleeve</b> was machined through both facing and turning with polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (PCBN) and plunge grinding with Al 2 O 3 wheels. The results indicated that when turning using mixed alumina inserts, better surface finish was obtained using the uncoated insert and appreciable differences between the two grades were not observed for the dimensional and squareness deviations. When comparing turning with PCBN and plunge grinding, considerable differences in the surface roughness results were observed, i. e., when generating a tapered surface, lower Ra values were given by grinding, whereas when producing a flat surface, best results were recorded after face turning. With regard to the dimensional tolerances, in general tighter limits were obtained after turning. Finally, when considering the geometric deviations both processes were able to keep them within the tolerance range, except for squareness, for which neither turning nor grinding was able to maintain the required limits...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Compared to the bond-type anchor, the {{compression-type}} anchor, whichanchors the CFRP tendon {{by applying}} a compressive force on its surface, presents {{the advantages of}} not needing a curing period for the filler and to reduce the sleeve length by more than 30 %. The fabrication of the compression-type anchor proceeds by changing {{the dimensions of the}} steel sleeve by hydraulic pressure, which means that the anchoring performance varies according to the region subjected to the compressive force at the surface of the CFRP tendon. Since the fabrication of the compression-type anchor is generally done uni-directionally, there is naturally some difference in the performance at the loaded end and free end. Accordingly, it is necessary to design the stress softening region to secure uniform anchoring performance at both ends. This study performs finite element analysis on 7 different shapes of <b>sleeves</b> with two <b>types</b> of taper based upon the dimensions of existing sleeves. From the analysis results, the design of the stress softening region of the free end is not possible by adjusting only the stress softening region but needs also to adjust the inner diameter of the sleeve so as to obtain similar stress softening regions in both loaded and free ends. For the sleeve with two tapers, similar stress softening regions could be achieved after compression by securing a stress softening region longer than 30 mm at the free end. This disposition was also seen to secure longer iso-stres...|$|R

At the time of gonioscopy the lenses had been in situ for a median of 20 months, {{with a range of}} 3 - 38 months. In 75. 9 % of cases one or both haptics were positioned posterior to the scleral spur with some degree of iris push. Iris tuck was seen in 29. 2 % of cases. Three different types of fibrous tissue formations were seen in the angles. The first two <b>types</b> (<b>sleeving</b> and iris haptic adhesions) occurred in the majority of cases and were haptic related. The third type was in the form of true peripheral anterior synechiae and occurred in 17. 5 % of cases. In cases with haptic related adhesions only, the angle remained open. Secondary glaucoma developed in 12 cases (8. 7 %). Ten cases had open angles. In the remaining two cases peripheral anterior synechiae were present in {{more than two-thirds of the}} angle, which was considered to be closed. Total burial of one of the haptics occurred in 25. 5 % of cases. A prominent iris vessel was observed near one of the haptics in nine cases. The thin looped haptics appear to stimulate fibrous tissue formation in the majority of cases. The haptic related adhesions add to the stability of the implant. It would make dislocation of the lens unlikely, even under severe trauma to the eye. However, once formed it would make removing the implant virtually impossible without severing the haptics. With time and with burial, the haptics seem to move away from the direction of the cornea. Total insulation of the haptic from the peripheral cornea is achieved with the occurrence of total burial...|$|R
