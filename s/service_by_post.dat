Innovations in low cost network {{computing}} have brought {{an era in}} which people can effortlessly and instantaneously view and post opinions collaboratively with others across the world. With such an infrastructure of public message boards, chat rooms and instant messaging systems, there is also a large potential for abuse by people wishing to capitalize on such open <b>services</b> <b>by</b> <b>posting</b> unsolicited advertisements. An entire industry has been constructed around the prevention of unsolicited electronic advertisements (SPAM). This thesis examines various techniques for preventing SPAM, focusing on Completely Automated Public Turing Tests to Tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA), a challenge/response technique where an image is displayed with text that is heavily distorted. It also examines the feasibility of breaking CAPTCHA programmatically, alternatives to CAPTCHA based on filtering, improvements to CAPTCHA using photo recognition and avoiding the need for CAPTCHA using naïve approaches...|$|R

A delegation of the Birmingham Chamber went to the annual meeting of Chambers of Commerce in London and John Skirrow Wright presented the idea, complete with all the details on how it would work including all the Postal Order values proposed. At first London bankers were against the idea, thinking it would affect their businesses, and the idea was rejected. However, eventually the bankers realised that the people who would use postal orders were not their customers and therefore no threat to their business. Consequently, at the Annual Meeting a year later John Skirrow Wright presented the idea again and this time it was accepted and the Postal Order system was started exactly as Skirrow Wright and Birmingham Chamber had proposed.|$|R
