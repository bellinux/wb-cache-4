50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the sound material used by the shaman constitutes a system of sounds. This idea of a semiotics of the sound material would imply a <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> shared between the shaman and the surrounding community. However, the evidence suggests that any <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> elements are understood only by the shaman and perhaps by other shamans initiated by this shaman. In other words the <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> - if there is one - {{is more likely to be}} shared with the spirits than with a human community.|$|R

40|$|This article {{values the}} {{importance}} of <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> through an Analog Hermeneutics and Communication Community. This philosophical itinerary starts in a collective subject called “Us” (“nosotros”) from the Latin American philosophical reflection. The symbol, such as meaningful space for semantics, shows up in a <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> that includes a variety of rationalities. This inclusion through <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> allows strengthening the “a priori” of a Communication Community that supports and ethical and historical “us”. For this purpose, an Analog Hermeneutics {{is presented as a}} valid method for philosophical thinking around the <b>symbolic</b> <b>language.</b> The analogy allows considering the ambiguous and unambiguous of languages and the hermeneutics through the symbol allows us to speak and think beyond what is stated. The Analog Hermeneutics invites to recover the different meanings and to interpret the senses through the symbol in different cultures. The symbol is a new inspiration for traditional Philosophy because it recovers wisdoms, customs, images and traditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are to describe effectiveness of Numbered Head Together (NHT) learning model in redox reaction in improving <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> skill and to describe effectiveness of NHT learning model in redox reaction material in improving concept mastery. Â Population in this research was all Grade X students in State Senior High School 1 Buay Bahuga in academic year 2011 / 2012. Samples were classroom X 2 as experiment classroom and classroom X 1 as control classroom. Samples were selected using purposive sampling. This reserach used quasi experiment menthod with Non Equivalent (Prestest and Posttest) Control Group Design). The effectiveness of NHT learning model was measured based on significant n-gain differences of <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> skill and concept mastery between NHT learning classroom and conventional learning classroom. The {{results showed that the}} average of n-gain of <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> skill for experiment and control clasrooms were 0. 26 and 0. 18 respectively, and the average n-gain of concept mastery for experiment and control classrooms were 0. 29 and 0. 23 respectively. Â Based on hypothesis test, classroom with NHT learning model had higher <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> skill and concept mastery than classroom with conventional learning. This indicated that NHT learning was effective in improving <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> skill and concept mastery of redox reaction...|$|R
40|$|One {{important}} factor {{to be considered}} in the process of algebrization of mathematics is the emergence of <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> in the seventeenth century. Focussing on three works, In Artem analyticen Isagoge (1591) by François Viète (1540 - 1603); Cursus Mathematicus (1634 - 1637 - 1642) by Pierre Hérigone (1580 - 1643) and Geometriae Speciosae Elementa (1659) by Pietro Mengoli (1626 / 7 - 1686), in this article we analyse two relevant aspects of symbolic language: the significance of the notation in the <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> and the role of Hérigone’s new symbolic method. This analysis allows us to better understand the role played by this circulation of ideas in the formative process of <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> in mathematics.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I examine Schelling’s {{construction}} of <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> in § 73 of his Philosophie der Kunst. I approach this construction in three ways. First, I compare Schellingian <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> to other contemporary {{theories of the}} symbol and language (in particular, those of Goethe, Kant and A. W. Schlegel). While Schelling’s theory of <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> possesses properties similar to these other theories (the identity of being and meaning, organic wholeness, the co-existence of opposites), I show that it differs in how they are interpreted. Second, I excavate the metaphysical and epistemological principles from Schelling’s philosophy of the period which underlie this theory of language. Three tenets from the Identitätssystem (as it is called) are crucial: formation, quantitative differentiation and construction. They illuminate why Schelling interprets <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> very differently to his contemporaries. Third, I consider the theological significance of Schellingian <b>symbolic</b> <b>language.</b> This significance is twofold. First, his theory {{gives rise to a}} conception of discourse without reference, and so to the notion of a theology without reference. On this basis, Schelling criticises Christian theology for remaining too concerned with referring to God, when what is at stake is rather the degree of intensity to which it produces God. Theology therefore stands in need of reformation. Second, the way in which theology is utilised by Schelling in order to construct <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> in § 73 of the Philosophie der Kunst itself provides a model for reformed theological practice. I argue that Schelling conceives of traditional theology as material for intensifying the production of God. In this way, an ‘absolute theology’ is engendered which has no concern for reference or for the integrity of the theological tradition. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R

40|$|Fox (1993) {{argues that}} the poetic {{function}} of language fulfils the human need to symbolize. Metaphor, simile and analogy provide examples {{of the ways in}} which <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> can be used creatively. The neural representations of these processes therefore provide a means to determine the neurological basis of creative language. Neuro-imaging has demonstrated that while metaphor, simile and analogy activate some areas of the brain in common, they also each activate different areas. This suggests that creative language has had sufficient evolutionary importance to be processed within more than one neural system. Additionally, the neuro-imaging data suggests that <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> activates areas beyond the language centres and therefore is encoded using sensorimotor representations. Here we will discuss the neural representations of metaphor, simile and analogy, and will reflect on the neural systems which have evolved to support <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> and how this understanding might be used to help develop skill in creative language...|$|R

40|$|Two {{decades of}} {{attempts}} to model the emergence of language as a collective cognitive activity have demonstrated a number of principles {{that might have been}} part of the historical process that led to language. Several models have demonstrated the emergence of structure in a symbolic medium, but none has demonstrated the emergence of the capacity for symbolic representation. The current shift in cognitive science toward theoretical frameworks based on embodiment is already furnishing computational models with additional mechanisms relevant to the emergence of <b>symbolic</b> <b>language.</b> An analysis of embodied interaction among captive, but not human-enculturated, bonobo chimpan-zees reveals a number of additional features of embodiment that are relevant to the emergence of <b>symbolic</b> <b>language,</b> but that have not yet been explored in computational simulation models; for example, complementarity of action in addition to imitation, iconic in addition to indexical gesture, coordination among multiple sensory and perceptual modalities, and the orchestration of intra- and inter-individual motor coordination. The bonobos provide an evolutionarily plausible intermediate stage in the development of symbolic expression that can inform efforts to model the emergence of <b>symbolic</b> <b>language...</b>|$|R

While completing the plan, the robot uses the metric guidance provided by a spatial layout, and grounded observations of door labels, to efficiently guide its navigation.
