5|$|After {{one hour}} of jury deliberation, Wise {{was found guilty of}} first-degree murder. The jury urged mercy in sentencing, and the judge {{sentence}}d Wise to a life sentence in prison, under the terms of which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> be freed by executive clemency.|$|E
5|$|McEntire {{was a guest}} {{judge on}} the July 13, 2016 episode of America's Got Talent. She used her golden buzzer, which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> use once and allowed an act to go {{straight}} to the live shows, on contortionist Sofie Dossi.|$|E
5|$|In their response, the Vipers' openers put on 78 runs {{together}} in just under 10 overs, before Edwards was dismissed for 24, bowled by Jodie Dibble. Suzie Bates was run out by Fran Wilson soon after for 52 from 46 balls. Georgia Adams added 15 runs {{before she was}} also run out, by Anya Shrubsole. Another good partnership, between Sara McGlashan (21*) and Lydia Greenway (17*), took the Vipers to their target with seven balls to spare. Taylor, who was named as player of the tournament, was the most effective bowler for the Storm, but even <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> limit the Vipers to six runs per over.|$|E
60|$|Adrea was {{the first}} to recover her composure. She was a little further away, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see <b>only</b> her step-mother.|$|R
50|$|One test {{involved}} placing {{people in}} a dark room and asking the psychic to state how many auras <b>she</b> <b>could</b> observe. <b>Only</b> chance results were obtained.|$|R
6000|$|A maid came in {{now with}} a blue silk gown very thick and soft. <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> do {{anything}} for Miss Freeland? No, thanks, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not; <b>only,</b> did <b>she</b> know where Mr. Freeland's room was? ...|$|R
5|$|Slavery {{existed in}} China since ancient times, {{although}} during the Han dynasty {{the proportion of}} slaves to the overall population was roughly 1%, far lower than the estimate for the contemporary Greco-Roman world (estimated at about 15% of the entire population). During the Tang period slaves {{were not allowed to}} marry a commoner's daughter, were not allowed to have sexual relations with any female member of their master's family, and although fornication with female slaves was forbidden in the Tang code of law it was widely practiced. Manumission was also permitted when a slave woman gave birth to her master's son, which allowed for her elevation to the legal status of a commoner, yet <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> live as a concubine and not as the wife of her former master.|$|E
5|$|Feeling {{that her}} {{employment}} opportunities were being blocked, that same year, on 19 January 1959, Johnson asked {{to address the}} members of the Bahamian House of the Assembly, but was told <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> speak after the session adjourned, to which she agreed. In her speech, she pointed out that a petition had been submitted to the House in 1958 for suffrage, which Members had claimed showed only 13 petitioners and 529 signatories. She provided mimeographed copies showing the actual number was 2,829 people and included people from Abaco, Andros, Cat Island, Eleuthera, Exuma, Grand Bahama, Long Island, and New Providence. She went on to complain that women were being taxed without representation and reasoned that should the vote not be extended to them, they should no longer have to pay taxes. She insisted that women were working members of society and were ready, willing, and able to participate as full citizens. Though the Members of Parliament were impressed with the speech, they did nothing.|$|E
5|$|As {{the season}} progresses, Elsa befriends series protagonist Emma Swan, Emma and the series' central cast resolving the help Elsa find Anna. The group {{eventually}} discovers that a figure named the Snow Queen (a more faithful {{adaptation of the}} original fairy tale's character) is somehow responsible for Elsa's trapping in her urn, a woman with similar powers to Elsa. They soon discover that the Snow Queen is Elsa's aunt, Ingrid, who was forgotten from Arendelle when Elsa's mother, Gerda, used {{the power of the}} troll king to erase everyones memory of her, not wishing for the world to remember how Ingrid accidentally killed their third sister, Helga. Ingrid soon discovered a prophecy that stated she would one day have the love of her sisters again. With Ingrid's sisters dead however, she believed she would be forced to create new sisters. For this, she chose Emma and Elsa. Ingrid had stalked Emma her entire life in preparation for the prophecy to become true, and manipulated events in Arendelle to bring Elsa to her. Being convinced that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> gain their love when {{she was the only one}} left, she obtained a mirror capable of bringing out the worst in people (the mirror coming directly from The Snow Queen fairy tale). If a piece of the mirror were to get in someones eye, they would see nothing but hatred in the world. Ingrid had planned to use this on everyone in Storybrooke (dubbed the Spell of Shattered Sight), forcing all of its citizens to kill each other while she, Emma, and Elsa remained immune. Ingrid had also used this to her advantage on Anna, forcing Anna to trap Elsa in the urn they originally found Elsa in.|$|E
60|$|Elspeth had said, in her {{shrinking}} way, that if {{she were}} a man <b>she</b> <b>could</b> love <b>only</b> a woman who was strong and courageous and helpful--such a woman as Grizel, she had said.|$|R
60|$|Janet, cold {{with horror}} and remorse, dragged {{herself up to}} the window again and listened. She must know--she must be sure. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> hear <b>only</b> a word here and there, but that word was enough.|$|R

25|$|A widow {{took her}} husband's {{place in the}} family—living in his house and {{bringing}} up the children. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> remarry with judicial consent, where the judge inventoried the deceased's estate and handed it {{over to her and}} her new husband in trust for the children. They could not alienate a single utensil.|$|E
25|$|At {{daylight}} on 2 January 1807, Saint Christopher {{was under}} Hodge's command and {{about three miles}} off Saint Bartholomew's when she encountered and gave chase to three French privateers. They separated, {{with the result that}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> capture one. The prize {{turned out to be the}} sloop Entreprenante, of one small gun and seventeen men. The two other privateers escaped into Great Bay, St. Martin's.|$|E
25|$|According to Decca Records {{producer}} Owen Bradley, the Four Star compositions only {{hinted at}} Patsy's potential. Bradley thought that {{her voice was}} best-suited for pop music, but Cline sided with Peer and the other Four Star producers, insisting that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> record country songs, as her contract also stated. Every time Bradley {{tried to get her}} to sing the torch songs that would become her signature, she would panic, missing her familiar country fiddle and steel guitar. She often rebelled, only wishing to sing country and yodel. She recorded 51 songs with Four Star.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, a UK {{woman was}} convicted of more than £11,000 in {{disability}} fraud after <b>she</b> claimed <b>she</b> <b>could</b> walk <b>only</b> four meters in five minutes, but continued {{to work at a}} job she previously held sweeping horse stables.|$|R
60|$|As Mara {{watched his}} {{demeanor}} with Moses, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> think <b>only</b> of a loathsome black snake {{that she had}} once seen in those solitary rocks;--she felt as if his handsome but evil eye were charming him with an evil charm to his destruction.|$|R
6000|$|The {{little girl}} was glad {{there was no more}} to eat, for she was ashamed to feel she had eaten every morsel <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> Her <b>only</b> excuse for being so greedy was that [...] "ev'rything tasted just splendid!" [...] as she told the queen.|$|R
25|$|In 1823 Anne-Thérèse {{entered the}} young {{congregation}} of the Sisters of Providence of Ruillé-sur-Loir. She {{was given the}} religious name Sister St. Théodore. She professed first vows September 8, 1825, and perpetual vows, {{which at the time}} were optional, on September 5, 1831. Sister St. Théodore was first sent to teach at Preuilly-sur-Claise in central France. There, she became ill, most likely with smallpox, and nearly died. The illness damaged her digestive system and, {{for the rest of her}} life, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> eat a simple, bland diet.|$|E
25|$|Her {{first period}} of {{education}} was at Liqing primary school. This school {{was one of}} several schools which accepted female students in Putian. Lanying Lin studied very hard at this primary school and often got the best grade in the class. But she was still required to do all the washing and cooking. As soon as she went back home, she started doing housework. At night, after finishing all her housework, she finally began studying and slept after 12 a.m. every day. And at six in the morning, she got up to cook and then went to school. At the age of six, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> sleep six hours a day and this continued for her whole life.|$|E
25|$|Monogamy was the rule, and a childless wife {{might give}} her husband a maid to bear him children, who were then {{reckoned}} hers. She remained mistress of her maid, and might degrade her to slavery again for insolence, {{but could not}} sell her if she had borne her husband children. If the wife did this, the Code did not allow the husband to take a concubine; but if she did not, he could do so. The concubine was a co-wife, though not of the same rank; the first wife had no power over her. A concubine was a free woman, often dowered for marriage, and her children were legitimate and lawful heirs. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> be divorced on the same conditions as a wife.|$|E
50|$|When Theodora {{discovered}} {{the whereabouts of}} the abducted Theodosius and returned him to Antonina, her intentions {{might not have been}} altruistic. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> be <b>only</b> repaying a favor, as Procopius viewed the event. But Evans deduces that Theodora used the affair to further bind Antonina to herself.|$|R
50|$|On 2 May 1389 in Prague, Sophia married Wenceslaus, King of the Romans. Wenceslas and Sophie were {{probably}} married by the king's chancellor, Bishop Jan. Wenceslaus {{was in a}} dispute with the Archbishop of Prague, which threatened Sophia's coronation. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> have <b>only</b> been crowned queen by an archbishop.|$|R
60|$|In {{spite of}} her cold indignation, {{and the fact that}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{understand}} <b>only</b> a part of Mattingly's speech, Christie comprehended enough to make her lift her clear eyes to the speaker, as she replied freezingly that she feared she would not trouble them long with her company.|$|R
25|$|Kremlyova {{focused on}} the outdoor track in 1993 and managed second place over 800 metres at the 1993 European Cup (behind Romania's Ella Kovacs) and a win in the mile run at the 1993 IAAF Grand Prix Final, {{preventing}} Sonia O'Sullivan from taking a double. Although she was selected for the 1993 World Championships in Athletics, ultimately she did not compete. She topped the 1500m podium at the 1994 European Cup, holding off Kelly Holmes. She was the second fastest qualifier at the 1994 European Athletics Championships, but the final was more tactical and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> place fourth behind Holmes and her Russian teammates Rogachova and Podkopayeva. Her fastest run that year came on the circuit at the Herculis meeting, where she finished in 4:01.05 minutes as runner-up to Podkopayeva. This put her fourth on the seasonal rankings.|$|E
25|$|Silva won {{the right}} to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics in the singles last chance from the Latin American Qualification Tournament held in Santo Domingo in April. The two {{previous}} days <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> reach the second round, but in the third she defeated the Cuban Glendys González to win her Olympic ticket. This made her the first ever Mexican representative in table tennis at the Summer Olympics, as well makes her known in her new country. Days later, she played the Latin American Championship's quarterfinal in the same venue and lost to Dominican Lian Qian in the singles quarterfinals. In the team competition, she defeated Ruaida Ezzeddine and Luisana Pérez to help her national team to qualify to the quarterfinals. With Silva leading Mexico with two more victories, they beat Brazil in the quarterfinals only to fall to the favorites Dominican Republic in the semifinals, with Silva being defeated in her only match by Wu Xue, accounting a tied bronze medal.|$|E
25|$|From {{the start}} Genie showed {{a small amount}} of {{responsiveness}} to nonverbal information, including gestures and facial expressions from other people, and made reasonably good eye contact. However, her demeanor was completely devoid of any expressions or discernible body language, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> nonverbally get across a few very basic needs. She clearly distinguished speaking from other sounds but remained almost completely silent and unresponsive to speech, and any responses she gave were to accompanying nonverbal signals. When upset Genie would wildly attack herself, but remained completely expressionless and never cried or vocalized; some accounts said she could not cry at all. To make noise, she would push chairs or other similar objects. Her outbursts initially occurred very often and had no discernible trigger—Kent wrote that she never tried to indicate the source of her anger—and continued until someone diverted her attention or she physically tired herself out, at which point she would again become silent and non-expressive.|$|E

60|$|Ludlow {{kept talking}} to her {{all the way in}} the horse-car, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> find <b>only</b> the briefest and dryest answers to his {{friendly}} questions about her mother and the Burtons; and all Pymantoning; and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not blame him for taking such a hasty leave of her at her boarding-house that he almost flew down the steps before the door closed upon her.|$|R

25|$|From {{the time}} of Genie's {{admission}} doctors saw clearly picked up some nonverbal information, with Kent emphasizing that she seemed very intent on looking at peoples' faces and made decent eye contact from other people, and she showed {{a small amount of}} responsiveness to it {{even in the absence of}} language. Despite this, Kent noted that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> get across a few very basic needs and neither made facial expressions nor used any discernible body language. When Genie was upset she would engage in silent, expressionless, self-harming tantrums until she had physically tired herself out, after which she immediately reverted to being completely non-expressive. She never cried during these outbursts—according to several firsthand accounts she could not cry at all—and if she wanted to make noise she pushed chairs or other objects. On a few occasions she responded to stimuli with a very soft, high-pitched, shrill laugh, but was otherwise completely undemonstrative.|$|E
500|$|HMS Rupert was an {{enlarged}} version of Hotspur with a rotating turret, two smaller guns, and heavier armour. Her machinery was unsatisfactory and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> make 12 knots rather than her designed [...] The ship was comprehensively reconstructed in 1891–93 when her old muzzle-loading guns {{were replaced by}} breech-loading [...] guns, her machinery was replaced {{and a number of}} light quick-firing guns were added for torpedo boat defence.|$|E
500|$|Cast {{members were}} more {{critical}} of Eve's later appearances on the show. Ross reacted negatively to Eve's involvement in Vincent's storylines. She said that Vincent giving birth to his father's child made her [...] "physically nauseous" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> complete the birth scenes after the show's acting coach, Maria O'Brien, convinced her of [...] " [...] comedic possibilities". Eve's incorrect reattachment of Julian's penis was criticized by co-star McKenzie Westmore. Westmore cited it {{as a reason for}} the show's cancellation, saying, [...] "This has got to be the worst storyline ever done, what are they doing?".|$|E
