The ZigBee protocol is used {{to set up a}} wireless sensor network to transmit information through wireless communication between a close-range node and a long-distance node. This process is just the same as information transmission between bees [5]. ZigBee technology supports three network topologies, including <b>star-type</b> <b>network,</b> tree-type network, and mesh network. This design selects a tree-type network [6].|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{information}} monitoring {{points for}} greenhouse environment were scattered, so a {{wireless sensor network}} with <b>star-type</b> <b>network</b> topology was designed and the wireless monitoring system for greenhouse was developed. By employing CC 2430 chip as the core hardware, WSN implemented real-time data acquisition and remote wireless transmission. The field data was transmitted to the monitoring host through RS- 232 interface. The node management software was developed based C language and the data management software was developed using LabVIEW 8. 6. The system was featured by low cost and simply installation. The primary experiments show that the system performance is stable and can meet the design requirement of remote data acquisition...|$|E
40|$|We analyze <b>star-type</b> <b>networks</b> {{of phase}} {{oscillators}} {{by virtue of}} two methods. For identical oscillators we adopt the Watanabe-Strogatz approach, that gives full an- alytical description of states, rotating with constant frequency. For nonidentical oscillators, such states {{can be obtained by}} virtue of the self-consistent approach in a parametric form. In this case stability analysis cannot be performed, however with the help of direct numerical simulations we show which solutions are stable and which not. We consider this system as a model for a drum orchestra, where we assume that the drummers follow the signal of the leader without listening to each other and the coupling parameters are determined by a geometrical organization of the orchestra.

40|$|A {{network is}} {{considered}} having two hierarchical levels, namely first choice routes and a <b>star-type</b> last choice <b>network.</b> The principle of alternate routing offers an economic {{utilization of the}} channels, a high probability that calls can be served in failure states even though with diminished GOS, and finally a certain capability to handle local traffic overload. The performance of such a network can be improved by an overlaid ring network connecting a number of switching nodes and taking over the overflowing traffics from these nodes. The ring can be operated with a central or a distributed switching system...|$|R
40|$|Power system {{operation}} and planning {{relies heavily on}} computer simulation programs such as load flow, transient stability, contingency analysis, state estimation, short-circuit studies and optimal power flow. All of the above mentioned methodologies for planning and operation involve simulation programs which require the solution of numerous sets of simultaneous linear equations, Ax = b, whose coefficient matrices are in general very large and sparse. The {{main part of the}} computational effort involved in these algorithms is dedicated to solving such systems of linear equations. This thesis investigates the properties of the coefficient matrix A that arises in power system analysis, as well as the application of more efficient alternative solution techniques for Ax = b which exploit these special properties. In particular, in this thesis, pre-conditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) methods have been applied and extensively tested {{for the first time to}} the solution of systems of linear equations arising in many power {{system operation}}s and planning tasks. In this vein, first, it is theoretically proven that some important power network coefficient matrices are positive definite and comply with the requirements for the convergence of the PCG method. The PCG algorithm is then applied to the Fast Decoupled load flow and to the DC load flow. Its performance is numerically compared with a Frontal band-width direct solver (Frontal solver) as well as with a Sparspak solver (B 5) with minimum degree ordering. The experimental results are based on a wide spectrum of power networks up to 5000 buses and about 10000 lines for two different types of networks: grid-type <b>networks</b> and <b>star-type</b> <b>networks.</b> These results demonstrate that the PCG method is clearly superior to direct solvers for certain types of large power networks. The performance of the PCG solver within other load flow algorithms is also numerically investigated. A detailed investigation into the eigenvalue clustering effect of alternative pre-conditioners which utilize the intrinsic properties of power networks is also presented. In addition, the effect of their eigenvalue clusterings on the convergence of the PCG algorithm is analyzed and compared with that of the classical incomplete Cholesky pre-conditioner. Furthermore, the usefulness of the PCG solvers is investigated for complex or indefinite power network matrices. A modified PCG method was applied to the IEEE test networks as well as to large synthetically generated networks (up to 6500 buses and 13000 lines) for the solution of systems of equations Y x = b, where Y is the complex admittance matrix. Comparison with direct solvers is provided. Finally, a new technique is developed to synthetically generate realistic data sets which characterize power networks of arbitrary size and complexity. While these networks are randomly generated, the software allows the user to specify the system dimension, type of network, connectivity configurations and other network characteristics. This software was developed to overcome the difficulties associated with the collection of network data, especially for large scale systems...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the link between {{information}} and entropy by considering the infamous Maxwell demon thought experiment. A non-rigorous mathematical solution by Leo Szilard established this link for the first time, as did Claude Shannon nineteen years later. In 1961, Rolf Landauer 2 ̆ 7 s mathematical solution resulted in the Landauer limit, which is still being hotly debated, but here we discuss the implication of this limit on Moore 2 ̆ 7 s law and future growth in computing power. A workaround the limit is proposed using an Analogue Artificial Neural Network (AANN). Here, we mimic the action of a human brain synapse formed from memristance connected between two Fitzhugh-Nagumo (FN) neuron models. All designs were simulated in Orcad PSpice^copyright version 16. 5, but a master-slave synapse was built, tested and outputs compared to simulation results. The synapse was also connected in a <b>star-type</b> <b>network</b> which displayed chaotic-type behaviour for certain parameter values...|$|E
40|$|The {{direction}} of sunshine or the installation sites of environmental control {{facilities in the}} greenhouse result in different temperature and humidity levels in the various zones of the greenhouse, and thus, the production quality of crop is inconsistent. This study proposed a wireless-networked decentralized fuzzy control scheme to regulate the environmental parameters of various culture zones within a greenhouse. The proposed scheme can create different environmental conditions for cultivating different crops in various zones and achieve diversification or standardization of crop production. A <b>star-type</b> wireless sensor <b>network</b> is utilized {{to communicate with each}} sensing node, actuator node, and control node in various zones within the greenhouse. The fuzzy rule-based inference system is used to regulate the environmental parameters for temperature and humidity based on real-time data of plant growth response provided by a growth stage selector. The growth stage selector defines the control ranges of temperature and humidity of the various culture zones according to the leaf area of the plant, the number of leaves, and the cumulative amount of light. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is stable and robust and provides basis for future greenhouse applications...|$|R
40|$|Empirical Modelling (EM) {{is a new}} appro h for {{software}} system development (SSO) that is particularly suitable for ill-defined, open systems. By regarding a software system as a computer model, EM aims to acquire and construct the knowledge associated with the intended system by situated modelling in which the modeller interacts with the computer model through continuous observations and experiments in an open-ended manner. In this way, a software system can be constructed that takes account of its context and is adaptable to the rapidly changing {{environment in which the}} system is developed and used. This thesis develops principles and tools for distributed Empirical Modelling (OEM). It proposes a framework for OEM by drawing on two crucial theories in social science: distributed cognition and ethnomethodology. This framework integrates cognitive and social processes, allowing multiple modellers to work collaboratively to explore, expand, experience and communicate their knowledge through interaction with their networked computer models. The concept of pretend play is proposed, whereby modellers as internal observers can interact with each other by acting in the role of agents within the intended system in order to shape the agency of such agents. The author has developed a tool called dtkeden to support the proposed OEM framework. Technical issues arising from the implementation dtkeden and case-studies in its use are discussed. The popular <b>star-type</b> logical configuration <b>network</b> and the client/server· communication technique are exploited to construct the network environment of this tool. A protocol has been devised and embedded into their communication mechanism to achieve synchronisation of computer models. Four interaction modes have been implemented into dtkeden to provide modellers with different forms of interpersonal interaction. In addition, using a virtual agent concept that was initially devised to allow definitions of different contexts to co-exist in a computer model, a definitive script can be interpreted as a generic observable that can serve as a reusable definitive pattern. Like experience in everyday life, this definitive pattern can be reused by particularising and adapting it to a specific context. A comparison between generic observables and abstract data types for reuse is given. The application of the framework for OEM to requirements engineering is proposed. The requirements engineering process (REP) - currently poorly understood - is reviewed. To integrate requirements engineering with SSD, this thesis suggests reengineering the REP by taking the context into account. On the basis of OEM, a framework (called SPORE) for the REP is established to guide the process of cultivating requirements in a situated manner. Examples of the use of this framework are presented, and comparisons with other approaches to RE are made...|$|R
