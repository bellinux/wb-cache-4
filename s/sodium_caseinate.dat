25|$|The {{isoelectric point}} (pI) is the pH of a {{solution}} at which the net primary charge of a protein becomes zero. At a solution pH that is above the pI {{the surface of the}} protein is predominantly negatively charged and therefore like-charged molecules will exhibit repulsive forces. Likewise, at a solution pH that is below the pI, the surface of the protein is predominantly positively charged and repulsion between proteins occurs. However, at the pI the negative and positive charges cancel, repulsive electrostatic forces are reduced and the attraction forces predominate. The attraction forces will cause aggregation and precipitation. The pI of most proteins is in the pH range of 4–6. Mineral acids, such as hydrochloric and sulfuric acid are used as precipitants. The greatest disadvantage to isoelectric point precipitation is the irreversible denaturation caused by the mineral acids. For this reason isoelectric point precipitation is most often used to precipitate contaminant proteins, rather than the target protein. The precipitation of casein during cheesemaking, or during production of <b>sodium</b> <b>caseinate,</b> is an isoelectric precipitation.|$|E

The animal rennet exhibited higher enzymatic efficiency than the fruit extract, irrespective of the source (i. e., bovine, caprine, or ovine) and the type (i. e., RS- or â-casein) of substrate. The enzymatic efficiency (kcat/Km) for RS-casein ranged from 72 to 220 and from 43 to 65 L g- 1 h- 1, and for â-casein from 242 to 742 and from 55 to 164 L g- 1 h- 1, for the animal rennet and the enzymatic extract of O. ficus-indica, respectively.

Our current studies concern gamma irradiation influence on the physical properties of calcium caseinate-whey protein isolate-glycerol (1 : 1 : 1) solutions and gels, used for films preparation. Irradiation of solutions was carried out with Co- 60 gamma rays applying 0 and 32 kGy dose. The increase in viscosity of solutions was found after irradiation connected to induced crosslinking. Lower viscosity values were detected, however, after heating of the solutions irradiated with a 32 kGy dose than after heating of the non-irradiated ones regarding differences in the structure of gels and resulting in different temperature-viscosity curves that were recorded for the irradiated and the non-irradiated samples during heating and cooling. Creation of less stiff but better ordered gels after irradiation arises probably from reorganisation of aperiodic helical phase and β-sheets, in particular from increase of β-strands, detected by FTIR. Films obtained from these gels are characterised by improved barrier properties and mechanical resistance and are more rigid than those prepared from the non-irradiated gels. The route of gel creation was investigated for the control and the irradiated samples during heating and the subsequent cooling...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study the {{physicochemical}} (acidity, color measurements), rheological (viscosity measurements and viscoelastic properties) and sensory (objective and hedonic) properties of stirred yogurt made from buffalo milk were evaluated. Yogurt samples with two fat globule sizes (large: 2. 9 μm; small: 0. 87 μm) were prepared {{with or without the}} addition of Whey Protein Concentrates (WPC) or <b>Sodium</b> <b>Caseinates</b> (SCN), and stored at 4 C for testing at day 1 and 7 after preparation. SCN addition resulted in increased lactic acid concentration, rheological properties (except loss tangent- tan δ), white color intensity and sensory viscosity. The effect of WPC on the aforesaid properties was lower when compared to SCN. Small fat globule size also increased the rheological properties apart from tan δ, brightness and sensory viscosity of yogurt samples. Increasing storage time resulted in reduced viscosity, increased acidity and rheological properties apart from tan δ and apparent viscosity. The greater decline rates were obvious for Newtonian viscosity at zero shear rate (η 0) and instantaneous elasticity (Gg) in yogurts with added SCN and WPC and large globule size and lower or negligible in samples without additives. In contrast, tan δ increased at a lower rate when SCN were added in products with large fat globules. Storage time increased the value of flow behavior index (n) in yogurts with large fat globules and, more rapidly, the value of elastic modulus (G') in the presence of SCN and WPC.

Whether the heat treatment of the milk affected the rheological behavior and the sensory characteristics of the samples was also evaluated. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) {{was used to assess}} in detail the relative contribution of whey proteins, caseins and fat on the rheological properties and sensory characteristics of the samples. Furthermore, it related the instrumental and objective sensory data to consumer perception (hedonic response of non-trained panelists). The objective acidity and white color intensity were positively correlated and increased with increasing casein content. Fat interacted synergistically with caseins to increase all the hedonic attributes, apart from odor. As far as rheological properties are concerned, elastic modulus (G'), instantaneous elasticity (G g), retarded elasticity (G R) and Newtonian viscosity (? 0) were positively correlated with increasing casein content. However, tan ? was negatively correlated with the aforesaid attributes and increased with increasing fat content. Whey proteins in the presence of fat determined the magnitude of flow behavior index (n). The lactic acid concentration (%) and the b component of color (yellow color intensity) were affected positively by SCN and WPC addition but in the absence of fat. In all regression equations the effect of process temperature was found to be insignificant.

40|$|Cream liqueurs {{manufactured}} by a one-step process, where alcohol was added before homogenisation, were {{more stable than}} those processed by a two -step process which involved addition of alcohol after homogenisation. Using the one-step process, {{it was possible to}} produce creaming-stable liqueurs by using one pass through a homogeniser (27. 6 MPa) equipped with "liquid whirl" valves. Test procedures to characterise cream liqueurs and to predict shelf life were studied in detail. A turbidity test proved simple, rapid and sensitive for characterising particle size and homogenisation efficiency. Prediction of age thickening/gelation in cream liqueurs during incubation at 45 °C depended on the age of the sample when incubated. Samples that gelled at 45 °C may not do so at ambient temperature. Commercial cream liqueurs were similar in gross chemical composition, and unlike experimentally produced liqueurs, these did not exhibit either age-gelation at ambient or elevated temperatures. Solutions of commercial <b>sodium</b> <b>caseinates</b> from different sources varied in their calcium sensitivity. When incorporated into cream liqueurs, caseinates influenced the rate of viscosity increase, coalescence and, possibly, gelation during incubated storage. Mild heat and alcohol treatment modified the properties of caseinate used to stabilise non-alcoholic emulsions, while the presence of alcohol in emulsions was important in preventing clustering of globules. The response to added trisodium citrate varied. In many cases, addition of the recommended level (0. 18 %) did not prevent gelation. Addition of small amounts of NaOH with 0. 18 % trisodium citrate before homogenisation was beneficial. The stage at which citrate was added during processing was critical to the degree of viscosity increase (as opposed to gelation) in the product during 45 °C incubation. The component responsible for age-gelation was present in the milk-solids non fat portion of the cream and variations in the creams used were important in the age-gelation phenomenon Results indicated that, in addition to possibly Ca++, the micellar casein portion of serum {{may play a role in}} gelation. The role of the low molecular weight surfactants, sodium stearoyl lactylate and monodiglycerides in preventing gelation, was influenced by the presence of trisodium citrate. Clustering of fat globules and age-gelation were inhibited when 0. 18 % citrate was included. Inclusion of sodium stearoyl lactylate, but not monodiglycerides, reduced the extent of viscosity increase at 45 °C in citrate containing liqueurs...|$|R

Solubility, heat gel strength, water binding and emulsification properties of these proteins were investigated under different temperature, protein to water ratio and salt treatments using model systems. Model systems were {{designed so that}} they approximated the physical and chemical conditions found in an emulsion- type sausage. The properties of the meat proteins were compared to those exhibited by a soy concentrate (GL 750) and three <b>sodium</b> <b>caseinates</b> (SV 07, SV 02 and CasN) measured under the same conditions. In addition {{the performance of the}} meat, soy, and caseinate proteins in an emulsion-type sausage was evaluated. MassMPC and MyoMPC exhibited superior heat gelling properties compared to the commercial protein products while SarcoMPC was more soluble and exhibited foaming properties similar to these products. All three proteins could be used successfully in sausages which had 3 % of the total protein replaced with additive protein. At a 30 % replacement level the addition of MassMPC and SarcoMPC produced undesirable effects on sausage properties. MyoMPC did not adversely affect the characteristics important in a commercial sausage, at this replacement level. However, in terms of overall functional properties and performance in a food system, MassMPC, MyoMPC and SarcoMPC were inferior to the commercial protein products. Data collected from this study were analyzed using the Pearson's correlation test to identify relationships between: functional properties assessed using model systems; sensory and instrumental measurements of emulsion-type sausage rheological properties; and model system functional properties of proteins and the properties of sausages incorporating these proteins. A negative correlation between emulsion stability moisture loss and water binding capacity was identified but this relationship was dependent on the methods used to measure these properties. Solubility was found to be negatively related to the water binding capacity of proteins. The Warner Bratzler Shear test, multiple compression test and extrusion test were the most useful instrumental measurements for evaluating textural properties considered important in a commercial emulsion-type sausage. However, the relationships between sensory properties and these instrumental measurements were dependent on the level of incorporation of protein additives in the sausages. Important correlations were identified between functional properties of proteins measured in the presence of 2 % salt, and properties of sausages which had 30 % of the total protein replaced by additive proteins. The usefulness of these relationships are discussed, the reasons why some relationships were not significant are suggested, and a new approach to studying the functional properties of proteins is proposed...|$|R

Special attention was given to the sol-gel transition point, which was defined by a frequency independent loss tangent. It was shown that the sol-gel transition point is completely controlled by the pH and the temperature, independent of the concentration <b>sodium</b> <b>caseinate</b> or the applied shear rate. Considering <b>sodium</b> <b>caseinate</b> solutions, increase of the temperature of acidification caused a decrease of the critical pH for gelation and a more dense gel structure. The formed gels were not in thermodynamic equilibrium, however, due to the slow kinetics of the system they were stable on the time scale of the experiment.

The results show significant enrichment of oil {{at the surface}} of particles compared to the bulk phase, and (when the non-oil components only are considered), a significant surface enrichment of <b>sodium</b> <b>caseinate</b> also. The study found evidence of high levels (80...|$|E
40|$|Aggregates {{were formed}} by heating {{mixtures}} of whey protein isolate (WPI) and pure κ-casein or <b>sodium</b> <b>caseinate</b> at pH 7 and 0. 1 M NaCl. The aggregates {{were characterized by}} static and dynamic light scattering and size exclusion chromatography. After extensive heat-treatment at 80 °C for 24 h, almost all whey proteins and κ-casein formed mixed aggregates, but {{a large proportion of}} the <b>sodium</b> <b>caseinate</b> did not aggregate. At a given WPI concentration the size of the aggregates decreased with increasing κ-casein or <b>sodium</b> <b>caseinate</b> concentration, but the overall self-similar structure of the aggregates was the same. The presence of κ-casein or caseinate therefore inhibited growth of the heat-induced whey protein aggregates. The results were discussed relative to the reported chaperone-like activity of casein molecules towards heat aggregation of globular proteins.

40|$|Growth of Bacillus stearothermophilus strain NCA 1518 Smooth in Dextrose Tryptone Agar (DTA) was {{inhibited}} by <b>sodium</b> <b>caseinate.</b> Binding studies {{indicated that}} <b>sodium</b> <b>caseinate,</b> when present in DTA, {{had the capacity}} to effect an iron deficiency which could cause inhibition of growth. Additions of essential cations, iron (1 mM), calcium (5 mM), magnesium (10 mM), or hydrogen ion (pH 5. 7), relieved inhibition. Responses to and interactions among these relief factors were analyzed statistically. Equations were fitted to the data and were used to estimate responses to all treatment combinations within the ranges tested. Results from these studies indicated that calcium, magnesium, and hydrogen ion acted by decreasing the binding capacity of the protein for iron, rendering this metal available for metabolic needs. Evidence was obtained that ferrous rather than ferric iron was the limiting factor in DTA containing <b>sodium</b> <b>caseinate...</b>|$|E
