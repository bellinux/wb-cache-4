50|$|Mnemiopsis leidyi, the warty {{comb jelly}} or <b>sea</b> <b>walnut,</b> is a species of tentaculate ctenophore (comb jelly), {{originally}} native to the western Atlantic coastal waters. Three species have been named in the genus Mnemiopsis, but they are now believed to be different ecological forms of a single species M. leidyi by most zoologists.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, {{research}} conducted by the University of Rhode Island, Graduate School of Oceanography, shows {{that there is an}} increase in the abundance of a tunicate species, Didemnum. The species has been spotted in the Rhode Island Sound area since 2000, but has been rapidly increasing in numbers ever since. Two certain species of jellyfish are currently having a population explosion within these waters. Mnemiopsis leidyi, commonly known as <b>sea</b> <b>walnut</b> comb jellies, and the Lion's mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata), are disrupting habitats with their invasive behavior in the Rhode Island Sound waters.|$|E
25|$|Walnut {{was laid}} down on 15 June 1939 as HMT Walnut (T103) by Smiths Dock Company at South Bank, Middlesbrough with the yard number 1031, one of 20 s {{built for the}} British Royal Navy. Walnut was {{launched}} on 12 August 1939 and completed on 13 December 1939. Walnut belonged {{to a group of}} ten minesweepers commanded by New Zealanders in the 24th and 25th anti-submarine and minesweeping flotillas, protecting convoys on the east coast of Britain where they faced numerous German air and <b>sea</b> attacks. <b>Walnuts</b> commander, Gordon Bridson, received the Distinguished Service Cross for his performance while in command of Walnut. By the end of 1946, Walnut was one of only two Tree-class trawlers still in service with the Royal Navy. Both were sold in 1948.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{the effects of}} the partial {{substitution}} of the pork back fat with different vegetable oils (<b>sea</b> buckthorn, <b>walnut</b> and sunflower) and walnuts on the chemical composition, texture profile and sensory characteristics of meatloaves. The dry matter and ash content of meatloaf with vegetable oils and walnuts were higher than the control sample (P < 0. 05). The cooking loss, energy values and lipid oxidation for the samples with walnuts and vegetable oils were lower than the control sample. The meatloaf sample containing <b>walnuts</b> and <b>sea</b> buckthorn oil had the highest total antioxidant capacity. The partial substitution of pork back fat showed a positive effect on textural and sensorial characteristics. Results reveal that the incorporation of vegetable oils and walnuts has successfully reduced the animal fat content in the finite products while improving the quality characteristics...|$|R
2500|$|There are {{two kinds}} of {{essential}} fatty acids that you must consume (omega-3 and omega-6). Experts say that you need to eat a balanced amount of omega-3s and omega-6s. However, some estimate that Americans consume twenty times more omega-6s than omega-3s. There is a theory that an imbalance of essential fatty acids may lead to mental disorders such as depression, hyperactivity and schizophrenia, but it still lacking evidences. An omega-3 deficient diet increases omega-6 levels in the brain disrupting endocannabinoid signaling in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens contributing to anxiety and depression-like behaviors in mice. Sources of omega-3 include flax seeds, chia seeds, <b>walnuts,</b> <b>sea</b> vegetables, green leafy vegetables, and cold water fish. [...] You can find sources of omega-6 in walnuts, hazelnuts; sunflower, safflower, corn, and sesame oils.|$|R
40|$|Decoding of the ctenophore genome prompts reevaluation of the {{complexity}} of the metazoan ancestor. W ith common names such as “sea walnut, ” “sea gooseberry, ” and “Venus ’ girdle ” that refl ect their morphological diversity, the jelly-like crea-tures belonging to the phylum Ctenophora that bear distinctive “combs ” of cilia are not only breathtakingly beautiful (1) but are also key to understanding early animal evolution. On page 1336 of this issue, Ryan et al. (2) decode the genome of the <b>sea</b> <b>walnut</b> Mne-miopsis leidyi, the fi rst member of this phy-lum to be sequenced, and propose that cteno...|$|E
50|$|Khorovats, an Armenian-styled barbecue, {{is arguably}} the {{favorite}} Armenian dish. Lavash is a very popular Armenian flat bread, and Armenian paklava is a popular dessert made from filo dough. Other famous Armenian foods include the kabob (a skewer of marinated roasted meat and vegetables), various dolmas (minced lamb, or beef meat and rice wrapped in grape leaves, cabbage leaves, or stuffed into hollowed vegetables), and pilaf, a rice dish. Also, ghapama, a rice-stuffed pumpkin dish, and many different salads are popular in Armenian culture. Fruits play a large part in the Armenian diet. Apricots (Prunus armeniaca, also known as Armenian Plum) have been grown in Armenia for centuries and {{have a reputation for}} having an especially good flavor. Peaches are popular as well, as are grapes, figs, pomegranates, and melons. Preserves are made from many fruits, including cornelian cherries, young <b>walnuts,</b> <b>sea</b> buckthorn, mulberries, sour cherries, and many others.|$|R
50|$|The {{idea for}} brownie brittle and the crisps {{came from the}} {{hardened}} drippings that would come off the pans used in her plant, and she developed {{a new type of}} process that would only produce crispy brownie edges. The company relaunched “Brownie Crisps” as Brownie Brittle and the renamed product was first sold in retail stores in April 2011. It was the first commercial brownie crisp company in the United States. In 2012 the company received $8 million in sales, and received the “Best New Snack Product” prize at the National Confectionery Sales Association awards ceremony. Also in 2012 Brownie Brittle was nominated {{as one of the most}} innovative new products at the Sweets And Snacks Expo and had sold more than two million bags of the product. Brownie Brittle also entered a partnership with Weinstein Co. to provide snacks for movie premiers, as well as their Golden Globe and Oscar events. The flavors of Brownie Brittle are Chocolate Chip, Toffee Crunch, Dark Chocolate <b>Sea</b> Salt, Traditional <b>Walnut,</b> Peanut Butter Chip, Salted Caramel, and Mint Chocolate Chip.|$|R
