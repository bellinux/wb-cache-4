5|$|A two-minute minor {{penalty is}} often called for lesser infractions such as <b>slashing,</b> tripping, elbowing, roughing, too many players, illegal equipment, holding, or interference. Five-minute major {{penalties}} are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, {{as well as for}} fighting. Players are released from the penalty box when either the penalty time expires, or the opposition scores a goal (or three goals for the instance of a major penalty).|$|E

5|$|During the Yayoi {{period from}} about 300BC to 300AD, iron tools and weapons such as knives, axes, swords or spears, were {{introduced}} to Japan from China via the Korean peninsula. Shortly after this event, Chinese, Korean, and eventually Japanese swordsmiths produced ironwork locally. Swords were forged to imitate Chinese blades: generally straight chokutō with faulty tempering. Worn slung from the waist, they were likely used as stabbing and <b>slashing</b> weapons. Although functionally it would generally be more accurate to define them as hacking rather than <b>slashing</b> weapons. Swordmaking centers developed in Yamato, San'in and Mutsu where various types of blades such as tsurugi, tōsu and tachi were produced. Flat double-edged (hira-zukuri) blades originated in the Kofun period, and around the mid-Kofun period swords evolved from thrusting to cutting weapons. Ancient swords were also religious objects according to the 8th century chronicles Nihon Shoki and Kojiki. In fact, one of the Imperial Regalia of Japan is a sword, and swords have been discovered in ancient tumuli or handed down as treasures of Shinto shrines or Buddhist temples. Few ancient blades (jokotō) exist because the iron has been corroded by humidity.|$|E
5|$|Rome's forces used typical Roman {{equipment}} including pila (heavy javelins) and hastae (thrusting spears) {{as weapons}} {{as well as}} traditional helmets, shields and body armor. On the other hand, the Carthaginian army {{used a variety of}} equipment. The Iberians fought with swords suited for cutting and thrusting, as well as javelins and various types of spears. For defense, Iberian warriors carried large oval shields and the falcata. The Gauls were likely wearing no armor, and the typical Gallic weapon was usually a long, <b>slashing</b> sword. The heavy Carthaginian cavalry carried two javelins and a curved <b>slashing</b> sword, with a heavy shield for protection. The Numidian cavalry were very lightly equipped, lacking saddles and bridles for their horses, and used no armor but carried small shields, javelins and possibly a knife or longer blade. Skirmishers acting as light infantry carried either slings or spears. The Balearic slingers, who were famous for their accuracy, carried short, medium and long slings used to cast stones or bullets. They may have carried a small shield or simple leather pelt on their arms, but this is uncertain. Hannibal himself was wearing musculata armor and carried a falcata as well.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{increasing}} popularity and prevalence of <b>slash</b> {{on the internet}} in recent years, some use <b>slash</b> as a generic term for any erotic fan fiction, whether it depicts heterosexual or homosexual relationships. This has caused concern for other <b>slash</b> writers who believe that while it can be erotic, <b>slash</b> is not by definition so, and that defining all erotic fic as <b>slash</b> takes the word away from all-ages-suitable homo-romantic fan fiction. In addition, a number of journalists writing about the fan fiction phenomenon in general {{seem to believe that}} all fan fiction is <b>slash,</b> or at least erotic in character. Such definitions fail to distinguish between erotic and romantic <b>slash,</b> and between <b>slash,</b> het (works focusing primarily on heterosexual relationships) and gen (works which do not include a romantic focus).|$|R

5|$|The {{third period}} began with Alexei Zhamnov {{notching}} the Flyers' fifth {{goal of the}} game to make it 5–2. Shortly thereafter, the game started to become more heated; Zhamnov and Daniel Alfredsson were assessed coincidental minors for roughing nine minutes into the period, and three minutes later Bryan Smolinski and Mark Greig were similarly penalized. Simpson returned to the box soon after, for <b>slashing</b> Michal Handzus, but Philadelphia's power play when cut short when they received a penalty for having too many men on the ice.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{scored a}} goal {{each in the}} second and third periods.

Ottawa received another penalty less than a minute later, which sent Todd Simpson to the penalty box for holding. A Flyers penalty against Radovan Somik for <b>slashing</b> Martin Havlat resulted in a power play goal for the Senators' Zdeno Chara, closing the score to a two-goal gap once again. Fisher subsequently received his second penalty of the game, for high-sticking.|$|E

25|$|Kirk/Spock, {{commonly}} abbreviated as K/S and {{referring to}} James T. Kirk and Spock from Star Trek, is a pairing popular in <b>slash</b> fiction, possibly the first <b>slash</b> pairing, according to Henry Jenkins, an early <b>slash</b> fiction scholar. Early {{in the history}} of Star Trek fan fiction, a few fan writers started writing about a romantic and sexual relationship between Kirk and Spock, highlighting a romantic or sexual element to the friendship between the men. As of 1998, most academic studies on <b>slash</b> fiction focused on Kirk/Spock, as Star Trek was by that point one of the longest-lived and most popular subjects of <b>slash</b> fiction, while its mainstream popularity made {{it one of the most}} accessible titles for academics and their audience, As the first <b>slash</b> pairing, K/S was created and developed largely independently from the influence of other <b>slash</b> fiction, with most of the conventions of the <b>slash</b> genre seeing their debut first in K/S <b>slash.</b>|$|R

5|$|Early in {{the second}} period, the game was {{paused for a moment}} of silence in memory of four Swift Current Broncos players who were killed when their team bus crashed in Saskatchewan five days previous.

Early the following season, Hextall received the third significant suspension of his career, missing six games for <b>slashing</b> Detroit forward Jim Cummins during a pre-season game.

5|$|It is {{not clear}} which {{carnivores}} may have preyed on Massospondylus.

The 6-metre-(20ft-) long carnivorous theropod Dracovenator lived {{during the same period}} (Hettangian to Sinemurian stages) as Massospondylus and has also been found in the Elliot Formation of South Africa.|$|E

5|$|Some mammals are omnivores {{and display}} {{varying degrees of}} carnivory and herbivory, {{generally}} leaning in favor of one more than the other. Since plants and meat are digested differently, there is a preference for one over the other, as in bears where some species may be mostly carnivorous and others mostly herbivorous. They are grouped into three categories: mesocarnivory (50-70% meat), hypercarnivory (70% and greater of meat), and hypocarnivory (50% or less of meat). The dentition of hypocarnivores consists of dull, triangular carnassial teeth meant for grinding food. Hypercarnivores, however, have conical teeth and sharp carnassials meant for <b>slashing,</b> {{and in some cases}} strong jaws for bone-crushing, {{as in the case of}} hyenas, allowing them to consume bones; some extinct groups, notably the Machairodontinae, had saber-shaped canines.|$|E
