40|$|Pedestrians are {{a high-risk}} group in vehicle impacts, {{especially}} in urban areas. In Europe pedestrians account for around 20 % of all traffic fatalities. In {{the rest of}} the world this frequency varies from 14 % in USA up to 47 % in Thailand. The majority of pedestrian fatalities are due to head impacts. Today’s cars are very densely packed under the bonnet. Certain stiff parts, such as the <b>spring</b> <b>tower</b> and the <b>top</b> of the engine, are very close to the bonnet. There is often not enough space for bonnet deformation by an impacting head. The consequence is often a severe or fatal head injury. Therefore, a protection system has been developed t...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The landing-type lifting pole with double-level arms {{is a kind}} of {{construction}} equipment frequently used in erection of large-sized iron tower during the engineering of power transmission line. This equipment lifts heavy load through bilateral symmetry, thus improving the working efficiency. A finite element structural calculation model of <b>tower</b> <b>top</b> of landing-type lifting pole with double-level arms was established according to the actual situation, and this model involved different working amplitude, lifting capacities and unbalanced loading conditions. In addition, the maximum stresses and structural stability coefficients of tower head, lifting arm, draw-bar and rotary tower body were analyzed, and the safety check results of various parts at <b>tower</b> <b>top</b> were obtained. Finally, the design of connection pin of each part at <b>tower</b> <b>top</b> of lifting pole was also proposed...|$|R
