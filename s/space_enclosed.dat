The matrix {{is important in the}} production of ATP with the aid of the ATP synthase contained in the inner membrane. The matrix contains a highly concentrated mixture of hundreds of enzymes, special mitochondrial ribosomes, tRNA, and several copies of the mitochondrial DNA genome. Of the enzymes, the major functions include oxidation of pyruvate and fatty acids, and the citric acid cycle.|$|E

At the south base of the rock is a large <b>space</b> <b>enclosed</b> by walls and gates, with great porticos on the inner side. A series of tolerably easy staircases, broken by intervals of gentle ascent, leads to the summit of the rock. The whole width of this is occupied by the palace.|$|E

A review of the early attempts to model the thermal environment of <b>spaces</b> <b>enclosed</b> by TMS is given and their environmental and thermal properties are discussed. The lack of appropriate tools for the investigation of their internal environment is identified and a need for further research in this area is suggested as a route to fully realising the potential benefits offered by TMS...|$|R

25|$|In 113BC, the Iranian Parthians conquered Dura-Europos, {{and held}} it, with one brief intermission, until 165 AD, {{when it was}} taken by the Romans. The Parthian period was a phase of {{expansion}} at Dura Europos—an expansion favored by abandonment of the town's military function. All the <b>space</b> <b>enclosed</b> by the walls gradually became occupied, and the installation of new inhabitants with Semitic and Iranian names alongside descendants of the original Macedonian colonists contributed to an increase in the population, which was a multicultural one, as inscriptions in Greek, Latin, Aramaic, Hebrew, Syriac, Hatrian, Palmyrene, Middle Persian, Parthian, and Safaitic testify. In the 1st century BC, it served as a frontier fortress of the Parthian Empire.|$|E

In the Toraja myth, {{the ancestors of}} Torajan people came down from heaven using stairs, which were then used by the Torajans as a communication medium with Puang Matua, the Creator. The cosmos, according to aluk, is divided into the upper world (heaven), the world of man (earth), and the underworld. At first, heaven and earth were married, {{then there was a}} darkness, a separation, and finally the light. Animals live in the underworld, which is represented by rectangular <b>space</b> <b>enclosed</b> by pillars, the earth is for mankind, and the heaven world is located above, covered with a saddle-shaped roof. Other Toraja gods include Pong Banggai di Rante (god of Earth), Indo' Ongon-Ongon (a goddess who can cause earthquakes), Pong Lalondong (god of death), and Indo' Belo Tumbang (goddess of medicine); there are many more.|$|E

40|$|The key aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a {{computational}} method for mapping architectural space used for visual openness analysis. We suggest that the result will offer possibilities for quantitative design analysis particularly on spatial quality influenced by architectural elements. The proposed method consists of two stages: determination of subdivided <b>enclosed</b> <b>spaces</b> and measuring quality using visual openness parameters on each subdivided <b>enclosed</b> <b>space.</b> We advise new approach to determine subdivided <b>enclosed</b> <b>spaces</b> on architectural plan by determining two factors: bounded space and circulation space. Computational procedures applied to analyse architectural plan and then determine map of subdivided <b>enclosed</b> <b>space</b> by analysing relationship of these two factors. The concept underlying this method is that architectural space is composed of subdivided <b>enclosed</b> <b>spaces,</b> which each of them have distinct physical properties and therefore become possible to develop mapping of evaluation regarding the quality of architectural space. Our finding on orthogonal architectural plan provides ranking index of subdivided <b>enclosed</b> <b>spaces</b> that could help for analysing spatial quality of architectural space...|$|R

However, as the buildings enclosing the latter were in completion, the architects were forced to alter their plans and the area was left unfinished until the early 1980s.
