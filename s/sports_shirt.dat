40|$|We want to {{sing the}} man at the wheel, who hurls the lance of his spirit across the earth, along the circle of its orbit. F. T.

In the 1950 s, American men followed the path of the Futurists driving dream cars with spectacular tail fins and fashionable synthetic jacquard upholstery while dressing in <b>sport</b> <b>shirts</b> of expressive fibers and designs compatible with their “living rooms on theroad. ” Adrian of Hollywood, famous women’s fashion designer, brought drama to men’s <b>sport</b> <b>shirts</b> in yarn dyed fabrics and original prints. While studying a 1950 s collection of Adrian men’s <b>sport</b> <b>shirts</b> and other sportswear from the period as well as automobile upholstery books in the clothing and textile collections of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, I observed a harmonious compatibility in textile fiber, color and texture.

Futuristic innovation in fiber and fabric contrasted with the ordered business and domestic suburban life of 1950 s men.

30|$|Although the {{performance}} of players wearing smart shirts is predominantly watched on court, {{it can also be}} experienced in a virtual space and abstract form by downloading data from the costume. According to Whitlock (2006, p. 85), “in an age of mediated bodies and avatars, the potential of motion capture in performance suggests a new method of character creation as well as new possibilities for recording and re-using human motion”. In recent decades, film studios have identified the potential of costume as a tool to translate human movement into data that can then shape the movement of a CGI character. Motion capture costumes for films are typically full body suits with reflective markers at strategic points on the body to plot movement through space. Despite the prevalence of this technology, Pingali et al. (2001, p. 76) observe that, “although there is some effort towards placing active and passive sensors on the players and objects to facilitate real-time motion capture, most sports do not allow such interference”. Sheets et al. (2011) note that quantitative kinematic measurements in realistic environments are limited by current motion capture technologies. Increasingly, designers are exploring the potential of integrating these capture techniques into fabrics worn by athletes. A smart <b>sports</b> <b>shirt</b> enables a more holistic capture of not just external points moving through space but also the body’s internal movement through muscle, respiration and temperature cycles. The capabilities of such a costume allow the body’s performance to be transformed into a cloud of numerical data.|$|E
