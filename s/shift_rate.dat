Migration may therefore become a key driver for future development of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. For 140 European plant species we computed past range shifts since the last glacial maximum and future range shifts {{for a variety of}} Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios and global circulation models (GCMs). Range <b>shift</b> <b>rates</b> were estimated by means of species distribution modelling (SDM). With process-based seed dispersal models we estimated species-specific migration rates for 27 dispersal modes addressing dispersal by wind (anemochory) for different wind conditions, as well as dispersal by mammals (dispersal on animal's coat - epizoochory and dispersal by animals after feeding and digestion - endozoochory) considering different animal species. Our process-based modelled migration rates generally exceeded the postglacial range <b>shift</b> <b>rates</b> indicating that the process-based models we used are capable of predicting migration rates that are in accordance with realized past migration. For most of the considered species, the modelled migration rates were considerably lower than the expected future climate change induced range <b>shift</b> <b>rates.</b> This implies that most plant species will not entirely be able to follow future climate-change-induced range shifts due to dispersal limitation. Animals with large day- and home-ranges are highly important for achieving high migration rates for many plant species, whereas anemochory is relevant for only few species...|$|R

Composite morphology was studied using scanning electron microscopy and 2 D Raman imaging revealing an inhomogeneous dispersion of BC within the gelatin matrix. The composite materials showed controllable degrees of transparency to visible light and opacity to UV light depending on BC weight fraction. By adding a 10 wt % fraction of BC in gelatin, visible (λ = 550 nm) and UV (λ = 350 nm) transmittances were found to decrease by ∼ 35 and 40 %, respectively. Additionally, stress transfer occurring between the gelatin and BC fibrils was quantified using Raman spectroscopy. This is the first report for a gelatin-matrix composite containing cellulose. As a function of strain, two distinct domains, both showing linear relationships, were observed for which an average initial <b>shift</b> <b>rate</b> with respect to strain of - 0. 63 ± 0. 2 cm(- 1) %(- 1) was observed, followed by an average <b>shift</b> <b>rate</b> of - 0. 25 ± 0. 03 cm(- 1) %(- 1). The average initial Raman band <b>shift</b> <b>rate</b> value corresponds to an average effective Young's modulus of 39 ± 13 GPa and 73 ± 25 GPa, respectively, for either a 2 D and 3 D network of BC fibrils embedded in the gelatin matrix.

Although baboons initially encoded both features of the first category, they ultimately retained only the distinctive features of each category. Empirical data from the two species were analyzed with the 1996 ADIT connectionist model of Kruschke.

One of the challenges {{in this regard is}} how to obtain the <b>shift</b> <b>rate</b> of river banks, as gauging stations are deficient for the study of river. reaches. The present study selected the Yinchuan Plain reach of the Yellow River with a length of 196 km as a case study, and searched each point of intersection of 153 cross-sections (interval between two adjacent cross-sections was 1. 3 km) and river banks in 1975, 1990, 2010 and 2011, which were plotted according to remote sensing images in those years. Then the shift rates for the points of intersection during 1975 - 1990, 1990 - 2010 and 2010 - 2011 were calculated, as well as the average shift rates for different sections and different periods. The results show that the left bank of the river reach shifts mostly to the right, with the average shift rates being 36. 5 m/a, 27. 8 m/a and 61. 5 m/a in the three periods, respectively. Contemporarily, the right bank shifts mostly to the right in the first period, while it shifts to the left {{in the second and third}} periods, with the average shift rates being 31. 7 m/a, 23. 1 m/a and 50. 8 m/a in the three periods, respectively. The average shift rates for the left and right banks during the period 1975 - 2011 are 22. 3 m/a and 14. 8 m/a, respectively. The bank shift rates for sections A, B and C are different. The <b>shift</b> <b>rate</b> ratio of the left bank in the three sections is 1 : 7. 6 : 4. 6 for shift to the left and 1 : 1. 7 : 3. 8 for shift to the right, while that of the right bank is 1 : 1. 8 : 1. 2 for shift to the left and 1 : 5. 6 : 17. 7 for shift to the right during the period 1975 - 2011. Obviously, the average <b>shift</b> <b>rate</b> is the least in section A, while it is maximum in section B for shift to the left and in section C for shift to the right.

During maintenance therapy, after S₁ scar (red scar) and S₂ scar (white scar) had been confirmed, S₂ healing <b>rate</b> and <b>shifting</b> <b>rate</b> from S₁ to S₂ were calculated. On the other hand, in case of recurrence of ulcer, recurrence rate was calculated. After maintenance therapy, recurrence rates were compared with the scar stage {{at the end of}} MT and the length of MT. Results : S₁ healing rate was 84. 0 % (3 M) in GU and 83. 2 % (3 M) in DU and the <b>shifting</b> <b>rate</b> from S₁ to S₂ was 63. 8 % (3 M), 82. 3 % (6 M) in GU and 65. 6 % (3 M), 89. 2 % (6 M) in DU. Recurrence rate from S₁ was 35 % (3 M) and 70 % (6 M) in GU, almost the same pattern as DU. <b>Shifting</b> <b>rate</b> from S₁ to S₂ in maintenance therapy was significantly lower in intractable ulcer than easily healing ulcer in GU and DU. Recurrence rate after long-term maintenance therapy was significantly lower than that of short term in GU and DU. Recurrence rate from S₁ was significantly higher than that of S₂ in intractable GU. In long-term MT and S₂ at the end of MT, the recurrence rate was relatively low in intractable DU. Conclusion : At least 6 months and sufficiently 12 months MT was nessesary to confirm S₂. In the prevention of recurrence after MT, long-term MT was more effective than short-term and it was necessary that S₂ should be confirmed at the end of MT in intractable GU and DU. In early relapsing ulcer from S₁ at the early period of MT, it was considered that half the therapeutic dose of H₂ blocker was insufficient...|$|R
