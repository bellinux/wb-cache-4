5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light <b>sleep</b> <b>and</b> decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave <b>sleep</b> <b>and</b> a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E

5|$|The {{hypothalamus}} {{is a small}} region at {{the base}} of the forebrain, whose complexity and importance belies its size.

40|$|<b>Sleep</b> {{difficulties}} <b>and</b> short <b>sleep</b> duration {{have been}} associated with hypertension. Though body mass index (BMI) may be a mediator variable, the mediation effect has not been defined. We aimed to assess the association between <b>sleep</b> duration <b>and</b> <b>sleep</b> difficulties with hypertension, to determine if BMI is a mediator variable, and to quantify the mediation effect. We conducted a mediation analysis and calculated prevalence ratios with 95 % confidence intervals. The exposure variables were <b>sleep</b> duration <b>and</b> <b>sleep</b> difficulties, <b>and</b> the outcome was hypertension. Sleep difficulties were statistically significantly associated with a 43 % higher prevalence of hypertension in multivariable analyses; results were not statistically significant for sleep duration. In these analyses, and in sex-specific subgroup analyses, we found no strong evidence that BMI mediated the association between <b>sleep</b> indices <b>and</b> risk of hypertension. Our findings suggest that BMI does not appear to mediate the association between <b>sleep</b> patterns <b>and</b> hypertension. These results highlight the need to further study the mechanisms underlying the relationship between <b>sleep</b> patterns <b>and</b> cardiovascular risk factors...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} cross-cultural differences in adolescent <b>sleep</b> hygiene <b>and</b> <b>sleep</b> quality. Participants were 1348 students (655 males; 693 females) aged 12 - 17 years from {{public school systems}} in Rome, Italy (n = 776) and Southern Mississippi (n = 572). Participants completed the Adolescent Sleep-Wake Scale <b>and</b> the Adolescent <b>Sleep</b> Hygiene Scale. Reported <b>sleep</b> hygiene <b>and</b> <b>sleep</b> quality were significantly better for Italian than American adolescents. A moderate linear relationship was observed between <b>sleep</b> hygiene <b>and</b> <b>sleep</b> quality in both samples (Italians: R =. 40; Americans: R =. 46). Separate hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that sleep hygiene accounted for significant variance in sleep quality, even after controlling for demographic and health variables (Italians: R- 2 =. 38; Americans: R- 2 =. 44). The {{results of this study}} suggest that there are cultural differences in <b>sleep</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>sleep</b> hygiene practices, <b>and</b> that <b>sleep</b> hygiene practices are importantly related to adolescent sleep quality...|$|R
40|$|Here, we {{describe}} the clinical characteristics of patients with Parkinson's disease, as well as study the relationship between <b>sleep</b> quality <b>and</b> cognitive functions.

We found a moderate inverse correlation between memory <b>and</b> <b>sleep</b> disturbances, <b>and</b> a moderate inverse correlation of memory and visuospatial function. We also observed other associations between subjective <b>sleep</b> quality <b>and</b> visuospatial function, <b>sleep</b> latency <b>and</b> the overall result of the SCOPA-COG, <b>and</b> between <b>sleep</b> duration <b>and</b> attention; all of these correlations were inverse and weak.
