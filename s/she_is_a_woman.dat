She is the only national leader of a church in the Anglican Communion who is a woman. Prior to her election she was Bishop of Nevada.

25|$|Lara Croft is {{the main}} protagonist and playable {{character}} of the series: <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who travels the world in search of forgotten artifacts and locations, frequently connected to supernatural powers. While her biography has changed throughout the series, her shared traits are her origins as the only daughter and heir of the aristocratic Croft family. She is portrayed as intelligent, athletic, elegant, fluent in multiple languages, and determined to fulfill her own goals at any cost. She has brown eyes and brown hair worn in a braid or ponytail. The character's classic outfit consists of a turquoise tank top, light brown shorts, calf-high boots, and tall white socks. Recurring accessories include fingerless gloves, a backpack, a utility belt with holsters on either side, and twin pistols. Later games have multiple new outfits for her.|$|E
25|$|Ranevskaya's {{failure to}} address {{problems}} facing her estate and family mean that she eventually loses almost everything and her fate {{can be seen}} as a criticism of those people who are unwilling to adapt to the new Russia. Her petulant refusal to accept the truth of her past, in both life and love, is her downfall throughout the play. She ultimately runs between her life in Paris and in Russia (she arrives from Paris at the start of the play and returns there afterwards). <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who lives in an illusion of the past (often reliving memories about her son's death, etc.). The speeches by the student Trofimov, attacking intellectuals were later seen as early manifestations of Bolshevik ideas and his lines were often censored by the Tsarist officials. Cherry trees themselves are often seen as symbols of sadness or regret at the passing away of a certain situation or of the times in general.|$|E

Former Labor Party advisor Anne Summers said in 2012 that [...] "Gillard is being persecuted both because <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> and in ways that would be impossible to apply to a man". In reply, journalist Peter Hartcher wrote, [...] "She was a woman when she was popular; she can't be unpopular now because she's a woman.

In addition, one woman {{has served as the}} Lieutenant Governor, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, under Gov. Parris Glendening from 1995 to 2003. Another woman, Kristen Cox, who was the Secretary of Disabilities, unsuccessfully ran for Lieutenant Governor as the running mate of the incumbent Governor Robert Ehrlich, when the Lieutenant Governor at that time, Michael Steele, left office to run for the U.S. Senate. Cox was a unique person to run for that office, not only because <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> but also because she is legally blind.|$|E

Hank Stuever of The Washington Post describes her as an [...] "ice-queen wife". The Independents Sarah Hughes echoes this description, saying Claire is so dedicated to the couple's schemes that it is clear she will execute them herself if Frank wavers. Following season 4, Robin Wright stated that she felt Claire Underwood was the equal of Frank Underwood and demanded equal pay for her performance. Netflix acquiesced.|$|E

Khaled Hosseini described her portrayal: [...] "The key word with Mariam {{is that she is}} isolated {{in every sense of the}} word. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who is detached from the day-to-day norms of human existence.

500|$|According to Warren French {{from the}} University of Wales, Godwin's works {{are most often}} seen as having two primary themes: gender roles and {{southern}} settings. French said Godwin herself disapproves of being categorized, which she feels creates [...] "externally imposed limitations" [...] on the themes she covers. However scholars continue to attempt to put her work into a distinctive literary category. In her early works Godwin {{was seen as a}} [...] "woman" [...] writer, because her books appealed to a mostly female audience and because <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman.</b> After publishing A Southern Family she began being identified as a southern writer. According to The Times (London), Godwin has a [...] "pesky resistance to categorisation" [...] and she often changes themes even after being commercially successful with one. Academic Lihong Xie said Godwin could be identified with the literary tradition of the Bildungsroman, which focuses on the moral and psychological development of a character. Many other critics posit that a quest for meaning and self-identification are Godwin's primary themes.|$|E

Although realising‚Äîand initially enjoying‚Äîthat she is an object to Diana and her friends, Nan stays with her for over a year as [...] "Neville", dressed in the finest men's clothes Diana can afford.

500|$|Since the 1920s, many fictional {{works have}} been {{inspired}} by Anderson's claim to be Anastasia. In 1928, the silent film Clothes Make the Woman was based very loosely on her story. In 1953, Marcelle Maurette wrote a play based on Rathlef's and Gilliard's books called Anastasia, which toured Europe and America with Viveca Lindfors in the title role. The play was so successful that in 1956 an English adaptation by Guy Bolton was made into a film, Anastasia. The plot revolves around a group of swindlers who attempt to raise money among Russian √©migr√©s by pretending that Grand Duchess Anastasia is still alive. A suitable amnesiac, [...] "Anna", is groomed by the swindlers to impersonate Anastasia. Anna's origins are unknown and as the play progresses hints are dropped that she could be the real Anastasia, who has lost her memory. The viewer is left to decide whether Anna really is Anastasia. Another film was released at the same time, Is Anna Anderson Anastasia? starring Lilli Palmer, which covers much the same ground, but the central character is [...] "perhaps even more lost, mad and pathetic, but she, too, has moments when <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> of presence and dignity".|$|E

When the group encounters fellow survivors Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) with Miles, they agree for Miles to switch places with Charlotte.

She kisses him, then watches on as he leaves.|$|E
500|$|Samus {{has been}} well {{received}} by the video game community. In 2001, IGN remarked that Samus has a cult following greater than most other female video game characters. She was chosen by the users of IGN as the most requested character who should have her own movie franchise by the website's users, the staff remarking that her tragic past makes her a perfect candidate for a movie, especially the loss of both her parents to the Space Pirates. Among their list of voted characters, IGN considered Samus to be the video game character that [...] "could lead the pack of video game adaptations that actually manage {{to live up to}} the source material." [...] Samus appeared in multiple GameFAQs [...] "Character Battle" [...] contests, winning the [...] "Character Battle V" [...] in 2006. In 2009, GameSpot featured her in their poll [...] "All-Time Greatest Game Hero", in which she lost to Mario in the semi-finals. Paul O'Connor, the lead game designer for Sammy Studios and a fan of the Metroid series, remarked that players empathize and identify with Samus because she is often rewarded for indulging in her curiosity. The book Videogames and Art noted that in the original Metroid the player is not briefed on Samus's past or future; the only interaction that they have with the character is by being her through gameplay, while bits of information can be gleaned from the handbook and through concept art, adding, [...] "Samus is very rare for the character intimacy gained solely through game play and for her stasis and then drastic change," [...] referring to the revelation that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman.</b> MMA and actress Ronda Rousey told GameSpot in a 2016 interview that she [...] "always wanted to be Samus" [...] if a live-action Metroid film is made.|$|E
500|$|From {{the outset}} of the marriage, {{political}} members of the Rothschild family took an interest in Rosebery, and he was soon acclaimed as one of the rising hopes of the Liberal Party. As a hereditary peer, he already had a seat in the House of Lords and had made his maiden speech there on attaining his majority. But brilliant as he was, Rosebery tended to lethargy and boredom. Lord Granville in fact considered Rosebery's wife to be the more ambitious of the pair, and even advised her [...] "If you keep him up to the mark, [...] is sure to have his page in history." [...] The subtle driving of her often languid and lethargic husband to achieve his [...] "page in history" [...] was to become her [...] Rosebery's secretary Thomas Gilmour noted: [...] "She is thoroughly genuine and very tender and devoted to Lord Rosebery, {{it is easy to see}} that she is very proud of him, and <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> of considerable force of character and great energy, she may prove to be a powerful ally in his political career." [...] Rosebery was not a natural politician. He was an idealist who disliked the rancour of politics, in fact [...] "his innate dislike of politics was something Lady Rosebery always fought against." [...] However, he was a gifted orator, and this was an era when platform speaking was beginning to replace House of Commons debate. On a tour of America before his marriage, Rosebery had been impressed by the campaigning of prospective political candidates; in Britain little had changed in that respect since the hustings of the 18th century. He realised how an electorate could be swayed by a candidate touring his prospective constituency, aided by a well thought-out series of events, rallies and advertising, with the candidate's ideal and attractive family smiling by his side. Thus Lady Rosebery not only pushed and encouraged him behind the scenes but was now to become an encouraging and conspicuous figure by his side. In this way it could be said she was the first openly [...] "political wife" [...] in Britain.|$|E
