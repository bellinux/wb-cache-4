40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedOver the past decade, Naval Special Warfare (NSW) {{has built up}} significant symbolic capital due to a string of highly politicized and romanticized military operations. The publicity, and the ensuing fame, helped set the conditions {{for the emergence of}} a SEAL counterculture characterized by an increasingly commodified and public persona. There has been a shift away from the traditional SEAL Ethos of quiet professionalism to a Market Ethos of commercialization and self-promotion, especially among former SEALs. At the same time, government officials, special interest groups, Hollywood, the publishing industry, and the media writ large have seen the profitability of associating their agendas with the <b>SEAL</b> <b>identity.</b> They are likewise tapping into SEAL fame and offering SEALs an outlet for the commodification of their SEAL affiliation. Such a promotional construct contravenes the dual requirements of security and surprise necessary for the success of SEAL missions. This paper analyzes these trends, and argues that the cultivation of celebrity status has incentivized narcissistic and profit-focused behavior within the SEAL community, which in turn has eroded organizational effectiveness, damaged national security, and undermined healthy civil-military relations. To redress this, all parties must work to reestablish an environment that refrains from promoting special operations for entertainment value, for profit, or for political gain.

40|$|International audienceEnhancing {{anonymity}} in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is {{much more}} than <b>sealing</b> participants' <b>identities.</b> It requires meth- ods to unlink the communication parties and relax their proximi- ty identification. These requirements should be fulfilled under several prerequisites, such as time limitation for session estab- lishment, involvement of several functional entities for session management, inter-domain communications and support of streaming services when the session is established. In this paper we propose the usage of a privacy enhancement framework, called Mist, as a solution to the anonymity issue in SIP. For achieving anonymity, the original Mist architecture was modified to be adapted in the SIP framework. We evaluate the adapted Mist framework to SIP and measure how efficiently it supports anonymity features...|$|R
50|$|A {{business}} <b>identity</b> <b>seal,</b> {{also known}} as a Verified Existence Seal, is one which verifies the legal, physical and actual existence of the business by verifying multiple parameters such as statutory details, contact details, management details, etc. Verified existence Trust seals add weight to the profiles of the deployers and boost confidence of prospective clients. A major benefit of a verified Trust seal is that it represents due diligence by the grantor before granting a certificate for the business.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the evolution}} of the Bulgarian national identity within the Bulgarian nationalist discourse, a bulk of 18 th and 19 th century literature that is often regarded as a coherent body that primarly displays the contemporary political myths that are dominant in the nationalist paradigm. By analysing this bulk of literature and by comparing different writings from different periods, this thesis tries to move beyond the nationalist paradigm and focuses on the evolution from the hybdrid atmosphere of 'Ottoman Bulgaria' towards the outspoken <b>sealed</b> of <b>identity</b> of the 'ancient' ethnic-national category of the Bulgarians, so outspokenly supported by the current political order. The comparative and chronological analysis of the main Bulgarian nationalist sources, are supported by three theories concerning nationalism that are applicable in the Southeastern European context. These theories consist of the periodization-theory of Miroslav Hroch, the thoughts of Benedict Anderson who underlines the influence of the erosion of religion and the assumed political relevance of ethnicity as assumed by Azar Gat...|$|R

Despite lacking conscious memories, Jane occasionally has flashbacks to her past life and retains {{a wide variety of}} combat and language skills. It is suspected she is a former Navy <b>SEAL,</b> whose <b>identity</b> is classified due to involvement in special operations. Based on a familiar scar {{on the back of her}} neck and a DNA test, Jane was believed to be Taylor Shaw, Kurt Weller's neighbor and childhood friend, who vanished 25 years ago and was presumed deceased, but the real Taylor Shaw was confirmed to be dead when Agent Weller's father confessed to her murder on his deathbed, Kurt subsequently finding Taylor's remains in an old campsite they stayed in as children; the DNA test results were altered by the conspiracy changing the records of the Taylor Shaw case. It is later revealed that Jane was born Alice Kruger in South Africa, then orphaned and trained as a child soldier by the apartheid regime. Shepherd eventually adopted her and raised her as a daughter.|$|R
50|$|Consisting of a {{stack of}} tiny, nested boxes, inrō were most {{commonly}} used to carry <b>identity</b> <b>seals</b> and medicine. The stack of boxes is held together by a cord that is laced through cord runners down one side, under the bottom, and up the opposite side. The ends of the cord are secured to a netsuke, a kind of toggle that is passed between the sash and pants and then hooked {{over the top of}} the sash to suspend the inrō. An ojime, or bead, is provided on the cords between the inrō and netsuke to hold the boxes together. This bead is slid down the two suspension cords to the top of the inrō to hold the stack together while the inrō is worn, and slid up to the netsuke when the boxes need to be unstacked to access their contents. Inrō were made of a variety of materials, including wood, ivory, bone, and lacquer. Lacquer was also used to decorate inro made of other materials.|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of inhumation cemeteries {{is a phenomenon}} of the mid-first millennium AD across Western Europe. They have been explained {{as the product of}} various historical processes, whether the rise of Christianity, the rise of ‘barbarian’ ethnicity or the rise of ‘the individual’. Such models remain unsatisfactory, since they treat the appearance of graves as the logical effect of specific causes, rather than allowing them a role in creating these historical trends. Recent theoretical approaches emphasise the way mortuary rituals actively created new pasts and reconceptualised futures, rather than storing fixed episodic memories to be accessed when necessary. If so, then the point of performing a ritualised funerary act is precisely the opposite of <b>sealing</b> an <b>identity</b> like a time capsule. The {{emergence of}} inhumation cemeteries in Late Iron Age Scotland (AD 400 - 650) {{can be seen as the}} materialisation of death, born out of changing attitudes toward the body and personhood in this time of rapid geopolitical upheaval. Instead of seeing inhumations as snapshots of a person, a socially-constructed and historically-contingent concept, this approach requires a more dynamic role for funerary practices as productive of social identity. A further implication is that such identities were altered unpredictably as conceptions of personhood continued to change during subsequent funerary events. In order to show these processes in action, this paper will track the development, use and decline of a single type of grave, the stone-lined long cist characteristic of Late Iron Age burial in northern Britain. This has been variously used as evidence for specific ethnic and religious affiliations such as ‘Picts’ or ‘Celtic Christians’, but the distribution and dating of this burial rite do not conform to any strict social boundaries. Studying the way long cists functioned at the funeral and within the wider cemetery illustrates how the materiality of inhumation was productive, not m...|$|R
40|$|A Dissertation Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Award of the Degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL. B), of Strathmore UniversityCyber warfare {{for it is}} a {{new concept}} in the conduct of war and is thus not {{properly}} understood hence considered a grey area with inadequate legislation. This dissertation seeks to bring to light the emergence and steady growth of cyber warfare as a method of war and to emphasize on the pressing need to regulate such wars. War is inevitable and many States are adopting this method of war because it harbors many benefits for the perpetrators who at first instance have their <b>identity</b> <b>sealed</b> and this enables them to escape liability for such actions. International Humanitarian Law is presently the legal basis through which cyber warfare is regulated. This paper offers an in-depth understanding of the ‘law of war’ vis-à-vis Cyber warfare. It seeks to examine the principles, philosophies, scope, laws, policies, rules and the rationale of International Humanitarian Law as a foundational basis to its applicability to Cyber warfare. It also looks into the manifestations of cyber warfare in the recent past and present as well as other institutional and regulatory influences in this field such as the Tallinn Manual which further provides that there are no treaty provisions directly addressing cyber warfare and although International law may also derive from custom, it is difficult to establish given the novelty of the field whether there is always enough available material and practice to draw conclusions of customary law from. This dissertation also offers some recommendations for future success in the regulation of cyber war...|$|R
2500|$|Although the Hunmin jeong-eum haerye (hereafter Haerye) {{explains}} {{the design of}} the consonantal letters in terms of articulatory phonetics, it also states that Sejong adapted them from the enigmatic 古篆字 [...] "Gǔ <b>Seal</b> Script". The <b>identity</b> of this script has long been puzzling. The primary meaning of the character 古 gǔ is [...] "old", so 古篆字 gǔ zhuānzì has traditionally been interpreted as [...] "Old Seal Script", frustrating philologists, because Hangul bears no functional similarity to Chinese 篆字 zhuānzì seal scripts. However, Gari Ledyard, Sejong Professor of Korean History Emeritus at Columbia University, notes that the character 古 gǔ also functions as a phonetic component of 蒙古 Měnggǔ [...] "Mongol". Indeed, records from Sejong's day played with this ambiguity, joking that [...] "no one is older (more 古 gǔ) than the 蒙古 Měng-gǔ". Ledyard deduces from palace records that 古篆字 gǔ zhuānzì was a veiled reference to the 蒙古篆字 měnggǔ zhuānzì [...] "Mongol Seal Script", that is, a formal variant of the Mongol ’Phags-pa alphabet of the Mongolian-origin Chinese Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) that had been modified to look like the Chinese seal script, and which had been an official script of the empire. There were ’Phags-pa manuscripts in the Korean palace library from the Yuan Dynasty government, including some in the seal-script form, and several of Sejong's ministers knew the script well. If this was the case, Sejong's evasion on the Mongol connection can be understood in light of the political situation in the contemporary (ethnically Chinese) Ming Dynasty. The topic of the recent Mongol domination of China, which had ended just 75 years earlier, was politically sensitive, and both the Chinese and Korean literati regarded the Mongols as barbarians with nothing to contribute to a civilized society.|$|R
