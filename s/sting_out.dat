5|$|Brundage {{hoped that}} the Munich Games would take the <b>sting</b> <b>out</b> of his defeat over the Rhodesian issue. Munich {{was one of his}} {{favorite}} cities, and the heitere Spiele (cheerful Games) were designed to efface memories of 1936 and Berlin {{in the eyes of the}} world. They initially seemed to be doing so, as athletic feats, like those of gymnast Olga Korbut and swimmer Mark Spitz captivated viewers. In the early morning of September 5, 1972, Palestinian terrorists from the organization Black September entered the Olympic Village and took 11Israelis hostage, demanding freedom for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli custody. Brundage, once informed, rushed to the Olympic Village, where he conferred with German and Bavarian state officials through the day, playing what Guttmann describes as a modest role in the discussions. German officials moved the hostages and their captors to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base, where German police and troops tried a rescue late that evening. The attempt was bungled; the nine remaining hostages (two had been murdered earlier) and three of their captors were killed.|$|E
25|$|The next {{match was}} between Sting and Butch Reed. Sting {{dominated}} Reed {{in the earlier}} part of the match. Reed gained momentum in the match {{with the help of}} his manager Hiro Matsuda. Reed applied a Chinlock and began using dirty tactics. Sting tossed Reed into the corner and tried to perform a Corner Splash, which he called Stinger Splash but Reed avoided it. Reed tried to perform a Corner Clothesline but fell out to the floor. Sting delivered a Vertical Suplex to Reed and tried to pin him but got a near-fall as Matsuda pulled <b>Sting</b> <b>out</b> of the ring. Reed took advantage and pulled Sting in the ring to perform a Swinging Neckbreaker. He applied another Chinlock. Sting countered with a Jawbreaker. Sting performed a Diving Elbow Drop. Reed threw <b>Sting</b> <b>out</b> of the ring and stomped him on the apron. Sting managed to deliver a Shoulder Block and tried to perform a Sunset Flip but Reed fell on Sting and held the ropes for the pinfall. The referee Teddy Long pulled Reed from the ropes, causing Sting to pin Reed with the Sunset Flip for the win.|$|E
25|$|Wilson was {{particularly}} cross, early in 1921, that with only 10 Guards and 18 Line (8 of them Irish) battalions in the UK to meet another threatened Triple Alliance strike, 4 battalions were being sent from the Rhine {{to supervise the}} Upper Silesia plebiscite: he asked Lloyd George {{if he wanted to}} be “Prime Minister of England or Silesia”. The Cabinet eventually agreed to let Wilson recall battalions from Silesia, Malta and Egypt, mobilise sailors and an 80,000 strong paramilitary “Defence Force”. In the event the miners struck without the support of other unions (“Black Friday”), and the sharp slump took the <b>sting</b> <b>out</b> of labour unrest.|$|E

25|$|Sting {{entered the}} 32-man tournament {{that was set}} up to award the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Sting {{defeated}} Brian Knobs, Meng, and Luger to reach the semi-finals to be held at WCW Mayhem. At the November event, Sting lost to Hart, the eventual winner of the tournament. After the match, Sting shook hands with Hart in a sign of respect, turning face again. Sting sought revenge against Luger the next month at Starrcade. Sting won by disqualification when Luger and Elizabeth assaulted Sting with a steel chair and baseball bat, putting <b>Sting</b> <b>out</b> of action for some time. Sting ended his feud with Luger by defeating him in a Lumberjacks with Casts match at Uncensored 2000 the following March.|$|E
25|$|Sting and The Giant won the WCW World Tag Team Championship at Slamboree in May when Hall {{turned on}} his {{teammate}} Nash. Sting and The Giant also split, and the team was forced to vacate the title 18 days later. Sting then defeated The Giant at The Great American Bash in June {{to take control of}} the Tag Team titles and chose Nash as his partner. Throughout the summer, Sting and fellow nWo Wolfpac members Nash, Luger, and Konnan feuded with Hogan and nWo Hollywood. Sting also got involved in a feud with Bret Hart over their similar finishing holds, the Sharpshooter and the Scorpion Deathlock. Hart cost Sting and Nash the Tag titles by interfering in their match with Hall and The Giant on the July 20 Nitro. Sting and Hart squared off at Halloween Havoc, where Hart, the United States Champion, attacked Sting with a baseball bat, putting <b>Sting</b> <b>out</b> of action for several months.|$|E
25|$|Crudely {{described}} {{the purpose of}} the operation is to break the connection between the patient’s thoughts and his emotions. It is to relieve the connection between the patient’s thoughts and his emotions. It is to relieve mental tension, to take the <b>sting</b> <b>out</b> of experience and thus to favour improvement or to hasten recovery from mental disorder. Risks were listed as death due to cerebral haemorrhage or infection; epilepsy; and personality changes. A text book of the day went into more detail about personality changes, suggesting that they always occurred to greater or lesser extent and left the patient with diminished judgement, childish behaviour, carelessness, loss of ambition, and generally living at a lower level than previously. There was also the possibility of intellectual deterioration. Overall in the Board of Control survey six per cent of patients had died (half of them directly {{as a result of the}} operation); 36 per cent had left hospital and 58 per cent remained in hospital (often described as quieter or easier to nurse). Patients who were depressed and had not been ill for long were much more likely to have left hospital than those who had a schizophrenic illness and had been in hospital longer.|$|E

He was considered for the award of a knighthood three times from 1967, but the honour was twice blocked by British officials. [...] In 1974 the British prime minister, Harold Wilson, intervened to secure a knighthood (KBE) for Wodehouse, which was announced in January 1975, in the same New Year Honours list in which Charlie Chaplin became Sir Charles.

500|$|Pat Nason of United Press International (UPI) {{wrote that}} {{marketing}} {{of the book}} [...] "may have been somewhat complicated by the cover art", which shows an actor in a gorilla costume with his middle finger raised, taken from the 1976 film A*P*E. Wilson had originally wanted the gorilla picture {{to appear on the}} back cover of the book; however, Warner Books stated it must appear on the book's front cover. [...] "It might stand as an apt emblem of the Razzies themselves," [...] commented Nason. [...] "We are not PC. We do not pull punches. We do not pay attention to the basic rules of decorum. Hopefully the humor with which it is packaged takes a little of the <b>sting</b> <b>out</b> of it", said Wilson to UPI. Christopher Borrelli of The Toledo Blade described the book as [...] "a merchandising tie-in" [...] to the Golden Raspberry Awards. Wilson announced the nominees for the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards at a book signing for The Official Razzie Movie Guide at Brentano's in Century City, Los Angeles, California.|$|E
500|$|Ponsford {{travelled}} to England for {{a second}} time, with the 1930 Australian team. In a wet summer, Australia won the series two Tests to one, recovering The Ashes. For {{the second time in}} as many trips to England, Ponsford fell ill—gastritis caused him to miss the third Test at Headingley Stadium. Despite this setback, Ponsford scored 330runs in the Tests at an average of 55.00. Wisden wrote, [...] "Ponsford had a much better season—especially in the Test matches—than four years previously.... In helping his captain to wear down England's bowling he accomplished great work and, even if he was seldom really attractive to watch, there could be no question about his skill and how difficult he was to get out." [...] The outstanding performer of the tour was the young Don Bradman, who scored 974runs in the Test matches—this remains a world record for the most runs scored in a Test series. Ponsford played a part in Bradman's success; Wisden stated that [...] "it is only fair to say that {{on more than one occasion}} [...] task was rendered the easier by the skilful manner in which Woodfull and Ponsford, by batting of different description, had taken the <b>sting</b> <b>out</b> of the England bowling." ...|$|E

[...] On the second verse, Eminem says that he has indeed made mistakes, commenting on his Relapse album: [...] "That last Relapse CD was ehh/ Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground/ Relax, I ain't going to do that now." [...] When he says [...] "All I'm trying to say is get back, click clack, pow", a gunshot is heard. Approaching {{the end of the second}} verse, Eminem raps about his personal experiences: [...] "But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out/ Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't/ It's time to exercise these demons/ These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now." [...] After the chorus, Eminem sings a bridge and focuses on a positive change, as he says [...] "I just can't keep living this way, so starting today I'm breaking out of this cage."

Later that night, Sting tore his left patella tendon in an attempt to attack Flair, and the injury put <b>Sting</b> <b>out</b> of action for the following five months.

2500|$|The {{threat posed}} by the Iron Guard, the {{emergence}} of Nazi Germany as a European power, and his own fascist sympathies , made King Carol II, who was still largely identified as a philo-Semite, adopt racial discrimination as the norm.

On January 21, 1938, Carol's executive (led by Cuza and Octavian Goga) passed a law aimed at reviewing criteria for citizenship (after it cast allegations that previous cabinets had allowed Ukrainian Jews to obtain it illegally), and requiring all Jews who had received citizenship in 1918-1919 to reapply for it (while providing a very short term in which this could be achieved - 20 days); ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviews were mixed, {{according}} to the Associated Press (AP) review summary. That summary quoted, for example, the review by Michael Kuchwara for the AP: [...] "Some reviewers felt Lloyd Webber took the <b>sting</b> <b>out</b> of a cynical tale. 'Wilder's bitter brew has been diluted,' wrote AP Drama Critic Michael Kuchwara. He added: 'When LuPone is off stage, the show sags.'" [...] Frank Rich wrote [...] "Much of the film's plot, dialogue and horror-movie mood are preserved, not to mention clips used to illustrate those sequences in which the faded silent-film star, Norma Desmond ...and her kept, young screenwriter, Joe Gillis, ... travel by car. The lyricist, Don Black ..., and the playwright, Christopher Hampton ..., smartly tailor their jokes to the original screenplay's style. At times, even Lloyd Webber gets into the Wilder swing. Both acts open with joltingly angry diatribes about Hollywood, part exposition-packed recitative and part song, in which the surprisingly dark, jazz-accented music, the most interesting I've yet encountered from this composer, meshes perfectly with the cynical lyrics. Anderson makes the sardonic Wilder voice an almost physical presence in Sunset Boulevard, but he is too often drowned out by both LuPone's Broadway belt and mechanical efforts of Lloyd Webber and his director, Trevor Nunn, to stamp the proven formulas of Phantom and Les Miz on even an intimate tale. At odd moments, the mammoth set advances like a glacier toward the audience or retreats, or, most dramatically, rises partly up into the flies, actors in tow." ...|$|E

On February 20, 1989, at Chi-Town Rumble in Chicago, Ricky Steamboat pinned Flair to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.

2500|$|His {{attitude}} towards Essays and Reviews in 1861, against {{which he wrote}} {{an article in the}} Quarterly, won him the special gratitude of the Low Church party, and latterly he enjoyed the full confidence and esteem of all except the extreme men of either side and party. It was also Wilberforce who proclaimed eminent geologist Sir Roderick Murchison the unofficial King of Siluria. On the publication of John William Colenso's Commentary on the Romans in 1861, Wilberforce endeavoured to induce the author to hold a private conference with him; but after the publication of the first two parts of the Pentateuch Critically Examined he drew up the address of the bishops which called on Colenso to resign his bishopric. In 1867 he framed the first Report of the Ritualistic Commission, in which coercive measures against ritualism were discountenanced by {{the use of the word}} [...] "restrain" [...] instead of [...] "abolish" [...] or [...] "prohibit." [...] He also endeavoured to take the <b>sting</b> <b>out</b> of some resolutions of the second Ritualistic Commission in 1868, and was one of the four who signed the Report with qualifications. Though strongly opposed to the disestablishment of the Irish Church, yet, when the constituencies decided for it, he advised that no opposition should be made to it by the House of Lords. After twenty-four years in the diocese of Oxford, he was translated by Gladstone to the bishopric of Winchester. He was killed on 19 July 1873, by the shock of a fall from his horse near Dorking, Surrey.|$|E
