40|$|Abstract. A {{primary goal}} of the US Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 is to slow the {{increase}} in disaster losses by emphasizing a proactive approach focusing on predisaster hazard mitigation, rather than postdisaster relief. The legislation requires local communities to produce hazard-mitigation plans that include multihazard maps, signifying a de facto prioritization of mitigation dollars {{on the basis of}} areas with the greatest vulnerability. However, there is little formal or practical guidance for communities on how to produce such maps. We propose a methodology for hazard-vulnerability assessments using multihazard mapping, where hazard frequency is a measure of risk, historical dollar losses are a proxy for infrastructure impact or exposure, and the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) evaluates human vulnerability. Using a test case of one county, Charleston, South Carolina, a geographic information system spatially combined these dimensions of vulnerability across multiple hazards. The resulting maps provide a tool for hazard-mitigation planning, which contains an initial <b>screening</b> <b>element</b> to highlight zones of highest multihazard vulnerability. The approach helps to generate a view of not just what is at risk, but who is at risk, and where, thus enhancing the implementation of targeted impact-reduction strategies. ...|$|E
40|$|Application of {{economically}} {{important and}} time saving pretreatment for the <b>screening</b> <b>element</b> mobility evaluation of contaminated sediments is presented. Ultrasonically-assisted single-step extraction (USAE) {{was carried out}} by EDTA solution. The extraction time of USAE was optimized and obtained results were compared with results estimated by conventional (EDTA extraction) and by sequential extraction (modified BCR protocol). The original three step BCR protocol was modified by addition of the first step (water leaching) and the fifth step, total digestion of sediment residue (acid mixture with HF). Zn, Cu and Pb have been determined in extracts by ICP-OES. Good conformity of the ultrasonically-extracted element contents and sum of contents, extracted during first three steps (water-soluble, acid-extractable, reducible - i. e., the most mobile fractions) of sequential extraction, was found. The sono-extraction reduced operating time of the first three steps of sequential extraction from 48 h to 15 min. Thus, USAE can serve as a rapid screening assessment of the mobile and potentially mobile element portions in sediments and other similar solid state environmental media. Analytical quality control was realized by comparison of the sums of element contents obtained at individual (five) extraction steps. Total element contents were also determined by an independent method (XRF) ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Since {{their first}} commercialization, the {{diversity}} of taxa and the genetic composition of transgene sequences in genetically modified plants (GMOs) are constantly increasing. To date, the detection of GMOs and derived products is commonly performed by PCR-based methods targeting specific DNA sequences introduced into the host genome. Information available regarding the GMOs’ molecular characterization is dispersed and not appropriately organized. For this reason, GMO testing is very challenging and requires more complex screening strategies and decision making schemes, demanding in return the use of efficient bioinformatics tools relying on reliable information. Description: The GMOseek matrix was built as a comprehensive, online open-access tabulated database which provides a reliable, comprehensive and user-friendly overview of 328 GMO events and 247 different genetic elements (status: 18 / 07 / 2013). The GMOseek matrix is aiming to facilitate GMO detection from plant origin at different phases of the analysis. It assists in selecting the targets for a screening analysis, interpreting the screening results, checking the occurrence of a <b>screening</b> <b>element</b> {{in a group of}} selected GMOs, identifying gaps in the available pool of GMO detection methods, and designing a decision tree. The GMOseek matrix is an independent database with effective functionalities in a format facilitating transferability to other platforms. Data were collected from all available sources and experimentally tested where detection methods and certified reference materials (CRMs) were available. Conclusions: The GMOseek matrix is currently a unique and very valuable tool with reliable information on GMOs from plant origin and their present genetic elements that enables further development of appropriate strategies for GMO detection. It is flexible enough to be further updated with new information and integrated in different applications and platforms. JRC. I. 3 -Molecular Biology and Genomic...|$|E

40|$|In the {{printing}} industry, {{one of the}} most common methods for reproducing halftone images using bilevel printing devices is clustered-dot ordered dithering. The images produced using this method are quite faithful to the original and are visually pleasing. Nevertheless, only rational angles are attainable with clustered-dot dithering, due to the discrete nature of the grids. This phenomenon can become detrimental in the case of four-color printing, when different screen angles and maybe even different screen frequencies are used for separate color planes, thus producing a so-called Moiré phenomenon. Another important drawback, the so-called banding or contouring effect, is related to the limited area of basic <b>screen</b> <b>elements</b> used in traditional dithering. In order to deal with these problems, we have developed, within the scope of our research, several new techniques for digital halftoning: (1) pseudo-random halftone screening, (2) a new method for generating clustered-dot halftone images having a number of reproducible gray or colour levels which is independent of the <b>screen</b> <b>element</b> size (CombiScreen), (3) rotated clustered-dot dithering, based on discrete one-to-one rotation, and (4) rotated dispersed-dot dither. A new method of pseudo-random halftone screening is described. It starts by obtaining the quasi-random distribution of tile centers according to some well-defined spectral characteristics. We then obtain the desired tesselation of the output device space by applying the Voronoi polygonization process. Then, an analytic black-dot curve is calculated according to the resampled input signal level and the area of each given tile. This analytic curve is scan-converted to obtain the blackened pixels. In the second approach, we associate threshold values to all pixels inside every tile according to some specially tailored analytic spot function. Then, the standard threshold comparison process is applied. Unlike known error-diffusion techniques, the pseudo-random halftone screening technique can be applied to a high resolution printing process. The characteristic <b>screen</b> <b>element</b> size can be properly chosen so as to ensure the best trade-off between {{the printing}} process constraints and the most precise printing. The described halftone algorithm seems to be appropriate for high-resolution color and black&white devices (above 1000 dpi). A new method (CombiScreen) is proposed for generating clustered-dot halftone images on raster printing devices having a number of reproducible gray or colour levels which is independent of the <b>screen</b> <b>element</b> size. The dither tiles generated by this method may contain several <b>screen</b> <b>elements</b> having any rational orientation and size. Threshold values are distributed among the cells of the dither tile so as to produce a large range of gray values, while at the same time preserving the clustered-dot behavior of individual <b>screen</b> <b>elements.</b> When rendering images at smoothly increasing intensity levels, this new method generates few contouring effects and other visible artifacts. The method works equally well for quadratic, rectangular, parallelogram and hexagonally shaped <b>screen</b> <b>elements.</b> Resulting dither tiles are generally either of parallelogram or of hexagonal shape. Since CombiScreen enables the screen dot frequency or orientation to be chosen independently of the number of gray levels, it has proven to be specially effective when printing at resolutions between 150 to 600 dpi with ink jet printers and at resolutions between 300 and 1200 dpi with xerographic printers. A new operator of discrete one-to-one rotation is described. It offers means previously unknown in the art for generating rotated screens which approximate irrational angles with high-precision, producing much less disturbing interferences and artifacts than other methods. Therefore, a carefully prepared dither tile incorporating <b>screen</b> <b>elements</b> with the desired period, initial orientation, and dither threshold values defining their screen dot shape growth behavior can be rotated by discrete one-to-one rotation and keep the desired <b>screen</b> <b>element</b> period, the number of cells per <b>screen</b> <b>element</b> and the threshold values associated with each <b>screen</b> <b>element</b> cell, thereby preserving the screen dot shape growth behavior of the original dither tile. Several different discrete one-to-one rotation variants are described: a small angle rotation technique valid for a subset of rational rotation angles, a rigid band technique and a technique based on discrete shearing transformations. The high-quality of the so rotated dither tile is due to the fact that discrete one-to-one rotation preserves the exact number of elementary cells per <b>screen</b> <b>element</b> and their exact dither threshold values. The described method provides a new range of solutions for obtaining high-quality digital angled halftone screens. High-quality solutions can be found for generating three digital angled halftone screens, each 30 ° apart from each other, as known from traditional photographic colour screening techniques. Further solutions minimizing Moiré effects may be obtained by halftone screens whose first order frequency component vectors sum up to zero. This new method has turned out to be particularly effective when printing with color ink jet printers at resolutions between 150 and 800 dpi as well as with xerographic printers at resolutions between 300 and 1200 dpi. Rotated dispersed-dot dither is based on the discrete one-to-one rotation of a Bayer dispersed-dot dither array. The halftone patterns produced by the rotated dither method therefore incorporate fewer disturbing artifacts than the horizontal and vertical components present in most of Bayer's halftone patterns. In grayscale wedges produced by rotated dither, texture changes at consecutive gray levels are much smoother than in error diffusion or in Bayer's dispersed-dot dither methods, thereby avoiding contouring effects. Due to its semi-clustering behavior at mid-tones, rotated dispersed-dot dither exhibits an improved tone reproduction behavior on printers having a significant dot gain, while maintaining the high detail rendition capabilities of dispersed-dot halftoning algorithms. This technique has successfully been applied to in-phase color reproduction on ink-jet printers as well as to black and white reproduction on laser printers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Most halftoning {{techniques}} allow screen dots to overlap. They rely on {{the assumption}} that the inks are transparent, i. e. the inks do not scatter a significant portion of the light back to the air. However, many special effect inks such as metallic inks, iridescent inks or pigmented inks are not transparent. In order to create halftone images, halftone dots formed by such inks should be juxtaposed, i. e. printed side by side. We propose an efficient juxtaposed color halftoning technique for placing any desired number of colorant layers side by side without overlapping. The method uses a monochrome library of <b>screen</b> <b>elements</b> made of discrete lines having rational thicknesses. Discrete line juxtaposed color halftoning is performed efficiently by multiple accesses to the <b>screen</b> <b>element</b> library. Index Terms—Color halftoning, discrete lines, juxtapose...|$|R
