In mid 2014, upon hearing that Letterman was up for retirement, Gervais jokingly tried to {{discourage}} him by suggesting they go on a road trip where they would spend all their money.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the large}} amount of {{headlines}} submitted to the site from the state of Florida, and because [...] "so many <b>stupid</b> <b>things</b> happen in Florida, it deserved its own Fark tag," [...] the Florida tag was created at the suggestion of users. Similarly, articles discussing Wil Wheaton – a Fark user himself – are given the Wheaton tag and articles discussing Christopher Walken are occasionally given the Walken tag, though Walken has never participated on Fark.|$|E

500|$|Music {{journalist}} Sarah Champion {{pointed out}} (prior to the million pound fire) that, [...] "Being 'in the money' doesn't mean they'll ever be rich. [...] always be , but their pranks {{will get more}} extravagant. If they earned £10 million, they'd blow it all by buying Jura or a fleet of K Foundation airships or a Van Gogh to be ceremonially burned." [...] "There are things we'd like to do which we haven't done.", Drummond told a journalist in 1991. [...] "Totally ludicrous things. We want to buy ships, have submarines. They really are <b>stupid</b> <b>things</b> I know, but I feel confident that {{in the event of}} us selling ten million albums we would definitely {{go out and buy a}} submarine....Just to be able to say 'Look we've got a submarine and 808 State haven't'." ...|$|E
500|$|Although he {{occasionally}} downplayed his own contribution to literature, Creangă himself {{was aware that}} his texts went beyond records of popular tradition, and made significant efforts {{to be recognized as}} an original author (by corresponding with fellow writers and willingly submitting his books to critical scrutiny). Vianu commented at length on the exact relationship between the narrative borrowed from oral tradition and Creangă's [...] "somewhat surreptitious" [...] method of blending his own style into the folkloric standard, likening it to the historical process whereby local painters improvised over the strict canons of Byzantine art. Creangă's complex take on individuality and the art of writing was attested by the his own foreword to an edition of his collected stories, in which he addressed the reader directly: [...] "You may have read many <b>stupid</b> <b>things</b> since you were put on this Earth. Please read these as well, and where it should be that they don't agree with you, take hold of a pen and come up with something better, for this is all I could see myself doing and did." ...|$|E
500|$|The French action {{drew the}} {{attention}} of not just the British, but also the Indian tribes of the area. [...] Despite good Franco-Indian relations, British traders had become highly successful in convincing the Indians to trade with them in preference to the Canadiens, and the planned large-scale advance was not well received by all. [...] In particular, Tanacharison, a Mingo chief {{also known as the}} [...] "Half King", became decidedly anti-French as a consequence. [...] In a meeting with Paul Marin de la Malgue, commander of the French and Canadien construction force, the latter reportedly lost his temper, and shouted at the Indian chief, [...] "I tell you, down the river I will go. [...] If the river is blocked up, I have the forces to burst it open and tread under my feet all that oppose me. [...] I despise all the <b>stupid</b> <b>things</b> you have said." [...] He then threw down some wampum that Tanacharison had offered as a good will gesture. [...] Marin died not long after, and command of the operations was turned over to Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre.|$|E

2500|$|Schlessinger used {{to combine}} her local radio career {{with a private}} {{practice}} as a marriage and family counselor, but after going into national syndication, she concentrated her efforts on the daily The Dr. Laura Program, and on writing self-help books. The books Ten <b>Stupid</b> <b>Things</b> Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives, and The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands are among her bestselling works. A short-lived television talk show hosted by Schlessinger was launched in 2000. In August 2010, she announced that she would end her syndicated radio show in December 2010. [...] Her show moved to Sirius XM Radio's Sirius XM Stars on January 3, 2011. Schlessinger announced a [...] "multi-year" [...] deal to be on satellite radio.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{some of the}} Beatles {{defended the}} use of the Butcher photograph. Lennon said that it was [...] "as {{relevant}} as Vietnam" [...] and McCartney said that their critics were [...] "soft". However, this opinion was not shared by all band members. George Harrison said in The Beatles Anthology that he thought the whole idea [...] "was gross, and I also thought it was stupid. Sometimes we all did <b>stupid</b> <b>things</b> thinking it was cool and hip when it was naïve and dumb; {{and that was one of}} them." [...] In 2007 George Martin, the Beatles' producer, recalled that the cover had been the cause of his first strong disagreement with the band. He added: [...] "I thought it was disgusting and in poor taste … It suggested that they were madmen. Which they were, but not in that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Suárez {{returned}} from his ban in the next season, in a Football League Cup game on 26 September 2013 against Manchester United, in which they lost 1–0. Upon his return, Rodgers spoke of his delight at having him back, while Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler felt {{it was time to}} [...] "start talking about Luis Suarez {{as one of the great}} players rather than the <b>stupid</b> <b>things</b> he does on the pitch", but warned that Suárez couldn't do anything else [...] "silly" [...] by pointing towards the loyalty awarded to him; [...] "the club have stood by him, so have the Liverpool supporters". Soon after, he revealed that he now felt calmer than ever whilst playing football; [...] "I realised that playing well, with more tranquility, is helping me a lot", and claimed he no longer wanted to act as he had in the past.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the seven}} years after she {{graduated}} college, Davis lived out of her car, which at first was her grandmother's Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera; she even built a bed in the backseat. She drove around to climbing areas, guiding and waiting tables to make ends meet, earning only about US$6,000 a year. She read throughout her journeys, from novels by Gabriel García Márquez to an autobiography by Kirstie Alley, to French short stories in the original language. Some of her favorite authors are T.C. Boyle, Victor Villasenor, and Rumi. Among her climbing heroes is Layton Kor. Her parents continued to disapprove of her lifestyle, however, and she felt very alone: [...] "My parents did not like my choices and thought I was doing <b>stupid</b> <b>things</b> with my life, {{and they told me}} so. I didn't feel like anyone cared if I did a climb I was proud of. They were just like, 'Great. What about your future schooling?'" [...] As Davis became more well-known and successful at climbing, however, she was able to make a better living, particularly from sponsorships from major companies such as Patagonia, Five Ten, Clif Bar, and Black Diamond.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the song}}'s release, Lorde teased the song on her Twitter account, saying [...] the [...] "Green Light" [...] would be [...] "different, and kinda unexpected. Complex and funny and sad and joyous and it'll make you DANCE." [...] Lorde {{announced}} {{the release of}} the single and its music video on Twitter on 2 March 2017. Later that day, in a Beats 1 interview with Zane Lowe, she also said: The song is really about those moments kind of immediately after your life changes and about all the silly little things that you gravitate towards. I say, 'She thinks you love the beach, you're such a liar.' What the fuck, she thinks you like the beach?! You don't like the beach! It's those little <b>stupid</b> <b>things.</b> It sounds so happy and then the lyrics are so intense obviously. And I realized I was like, 'how come this thing is coming out so joyous sounding?' And I realized this is that drunk girl at the party dancing around crying about her ex-boyfriend who everyone thinks is a mess. That's her tonight and tomorrow she starts to rebuild. And that's the song for me.|$|E
2500|$|The French action {{drew the}} {{attention}} of not just the British, but also the Indian tribes of the area. [...] Despite good Franco-Indian relations, British traders became successful in convincing the Indians to trade with them in preference to the Canadiens, and the planned large-scale advance was not well received by all. [...] The reason for this {{was that they had}} to provide them with the goods that the Anglo-American traders had previously supplied, and at similar prices. This proved to be singularly difficult. [...] With the exception of one or two Montreal merchant traders, the Canadians showed a great reluctance to venture into the Ohio country. [...] In particular, Tanacharison, a Mingo chief also known as the [...] "Half King", became anti-French as a consequence. [...] In a meeting with Paul Marin de la Malgue, commander of the Canadian construction force, the latter reportedly lost his temper, and shouted at the Indian chief, [...] "I tell you, down the river I will go. [...] If the river is blocked up, I have the forces to burst it open and tread under my feet all that oppose me. [...] I despise all the <b>stupid</b> <b>things</b> you have said."
