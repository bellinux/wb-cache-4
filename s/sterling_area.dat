25|$|As the Malaysian dollar {{replaced}} the Malaya and British Borneo dollar at par and Malaysia was a participating {{member of the}} <b>sterling</b> <b>area,</b> the new dollar was originally valued at 8.57 dollars per 1 British pound sterling. In November 1967, {{five months after the}} introduction of the Malaysian dollar, the pound was devalued by 14.3%, leading to a collapse in confidence for the <b>sterling</b> <b>area</b> and its demise in 1972. The new currency was not affected but earlier notes of the Malaya and British Borneo dollar were still pegged at 8.57 dollars per 1pound; consequently these notes were reduced in value to 85 cents per dollar.|$|E
25|$|In Britain, the {{nationalisation}} {{was perceived}} as {{a direct threat to}} British interests. In a letter to the British Ambassador on 10 September 1956, Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick, the Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office wrote: If we sit back while Nasser consolidates his position and gradually acquires control of the oil-bearing countries, he can and is, according to our information, resolved to wreck us. If Middle Eastern oil is denied to us for a year or two, our gold reserves will disappear. If our gold reserves disappear, the <b>sterling</b> <b>area</b> disintegrates. If the <b>sterling</b> <b>area</b> disintegrates and we have no reserves, we shall not be able to maintain a force in Germany, or indeed, anywhere else. I doubt whether we shall be able to pay for the bare minimum necessary for our defence. And a country that cannot provide for its defence is finished.|$|E

A separate central bank gave New Zealand's government control of monetary policy for the first time, although New Zealand remained part of the <b>Sterling</b> <b>area</b> by pegging its pound to the British Pound until {{the introduction of the}} New Zealand Dollar in 1967, when the dollar was instead pegged to the Australian dollar.|$|E

25|$|The Australian pound, {{introduced}} in 1910 and officially distinct in value from the pound sterling since devaluation in 1931, {{was replaced by}} the dollar on 14 February 1966. The rate of conversion for the new decimal currency was two dollars per Australian pound, or ten Australian shillings per dollar. The exchange rate was pegged to the pound sterling at a rate of $1 = 8 shillings ($2.50 = UK £1). In 1967, Australia effectively left the <b>sterling</b> <b>area,</b> when the pound sterling was devalued against the US dollar and the Australian dollar did not follow. It maintained its peg to the US dollar at the rate of A$1 = US$1.12.|$|E
25|$|Reflecting re-orientation {{of trade}} flows in the 1950s and 1960s, Britain had {{decided in the}} late 1960s to re-orientate its trade and {{economic}} policy from the Commonwealth of Nations to the European Economic Community, and the 1960s and early 1970s saw a corresponding further reduction in the economic relationship between Britain and the major realms, including Australia. In 1967, the pound sterling was devalued, but Australia did not follow suit, instead moving to a peg between the Australian dollar and the pound sterling at a different rate. In 1971, Australia switched its peg altogether, to the United States dollar, and in June 1972 Britain responded to this and other changes resulting from Britain's shrinking economic presence {{in the world by}} shrinking the <b>sterling</b> <b>area,</b> effectively ending the former monetary union.|$|E
25|$|India {{has a high}} {{commission}} in London and two consulates-general in Birmingham and Edinburgh. The United Kingdom has a {{high commission}} in New Delhi and five deputy high commissions in Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Kolkata. Since 1947, India's relations with the United Kingdom have been through bilateral, {{as well as through}} the Commonwealth of Nations framework. Although the <b>Sterling</b> <b>Area</b> no longer exists and the Commonwealth is much more an informal forum, India and the UK still have many enduring links. This is in part due to the significant number of people of Indian origin living in the UK. The large South Asian population in the UK results in steady travel and communication between the two countries. The British Raj allowed for both cultures to imbibe tremendously from the other. The English language and cricket are perhaps the two most evident British exports, whilst in the UK food from the Indian subcontinent are very popular. The United Kingdom's favourite food is often reported to be Indian cuisine, although no official study reports this.|$|E

500|$|Black nationalists in Rhodesia {{and their}} {{overseas}} supporters, prominently the OAU, clamoured for Britain to remove Smith's government {{with a military}} invasion, but Britain dismissed this option because of various logistical issues, the risk of provoking a pre-emptive Rhodesian strike on Zambia, and the psychological problems that were likely to accompany any confrontation between British and Rhodesian troops in what Smith said would be a [...] "fratricidal war". Wilson instead resolved to end the Rhodesian rebellion through economic sanctions; these principally comprised the expulsion of Rhodesia from the <b>Sterling</b> <b>area,</b> {{a ban on the}} import of Rhodesian sugar, tobacco, chrome and other goods, and an oil boycott of Rhodesia. When the Rhodesians continued to receive oil, Wilson attempted to directly cut off their main supply lines, namely the Portuguese Mozambican ports at Beira and Lourenço Marques, by posting a Royal Navy squadron to the Mozambique Channel in March 1966. This blockade, the Beira Patrol, was endorsed the following month by UN Security Council Resolution 221. The United Nations proceeded to institute the first mandatory trade sanctions in its history with Security Council Resolutions 232 (December 1966) and 253 (April 1968), which required member states to cease all trade and economic links with Rhodesia.|$|E

2500|$|Eden’s biographer Richard Lamb {{said that}} Eden bullied Churchill into going back on {{commitments}} to European unity made in opposition. The truth {{appears to be}} more complex. Britain was still a world power, or at least trying to be, in 1945–55, with the concept of sovereignty not as discredited as on the continent. The USA encouraged moves towards European federalism as it wanted to withdraw US troops and get the Germans rearmed under supervision. Eden was less Atlanticist than Churchill and had little time for European federalism. He wanted firm alliances with France and other Western European powers to contain Germany. Half of British trade at that time was with the <b>sterling</b> <b>area,</b> and only a quarter with Western Europe. Despite later talk of [...] "lost opportunities", even Macmillan, who had been {{an active member of the}} [...] "European Movement" [...] after the war, acknowledged in February 1952 that Britain’s relationship with the USA and the Commonwealth would prevent her from joining a federal Europe at that time. Eden was also irritated by Churchill's hankering for a summit meeting with the USSR, during the period in 1953 after Stalin's death and whilst Eden was seriously ill from a botched bile duct operation.|$|E
50|$|The UK {{government}} devalued {{the pound}} sterling in November 1967 from £1= $2.80 to £1 = $2.40. This was not welcomed {{in many parts}} of the <b>sterling</b> <b>area,</b> and, unlike in the 1949 devaluation, many <b>sterling</b> <b>area</b> countries did not devalue their currencies at the same time. This was the beginning of the end for the <b>sterling</b> <b>area.</b> The Basel agreements of 1968 were designed to minimise flight from sterling to the US dollar within the <b>sterling</b> <b>area.</b> On 22 June 1972 Britain imposed exchange controls on the <b>sterling</b> <b>area,</b> with the exception of Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Crown dependencies in the Channel Islands. At the same time, Britain floated the pound sterling. According to Chancellor of the Exchequer Anthony Barber, this was to halt a recent increase in capital outflow to other parts of the <b>sterling</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

50|$|After the Second World War, the Bretton Woods {{system of}} fixed {{exchange}} rates to the US dollar (convertible to gold) gave the <b>Sterling</b> <b>Area</b> a second {{lease of life}} as Commonwealth kinship and trading loyalties were maintained after Britain's withdrawal from Empire by keeping a sterling peg and staying in the <b>Sterling</b> <b>Area,</b> rather than maintaining a direct dollar peg. Despite this, sterling did not regain anything like its place in international commerce that it had had before the war, and a devastated and financially exhausted Britain could not defend the international value of the pound to maintain confidence in the system, resulting in a devaluation of sterling against the dollar in 1967 that was not reflected in other <b>Sterling</b> <b>Area</b> currencies.
