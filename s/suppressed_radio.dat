40|$|It {{has long}} been known that black holes in X-ray {{binaries}} exhibit spectral states - qualitatively distinct sets of X-ray spectral and variability properties. Recent work has helped to establish that these states are also well correlated with the systems' radio properties, with a key result being that the soft spectral states seen at a few percent of the Eddington luminosity show strongly <b>suppressed</b> <b>radio</b> emission. Additionally, it is now shown that the radio luminosity, X-ray luminosity and mass of a black hole form a fundamental plane. In this contribution, we draw together numerous previous results to show that these spectral state are likely to exist in AGN as well; once one corrects for the effects of black hole mass, a clear downturn is seen in the ratio of radio-to-X-ray luminosities. Furthermore, the majority of the systems seen in this luminosity range show soft excesses in their X-ray spectra. This result adds to the growing body of evidence that AGN exhibit very similar spectral state phenomenology as do X-ray binaries...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the radio properties of large samples of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at z ~ 3, 4, and 5 from the COSMOS field. The median stacking analysis yields a statistical detection of the z ~ 3 LBGs (U-band dropouts), with a 1. 4 GHz flux density of 0 : 90 ± 0 : 21 µJy. The stacked emission is unresolved, with a size < 1, or a physical size < 8 kpc. The total star formation rate implied by this radio luminosity is 31 ± 7 Mסּ yr^(- 1), based on the radio-FIR correlation in low-redshift star-forming galaxies. The star formation rate derived from a similar analysis of the UV luminosities is 17 Mסּ yr^(- 1), without any correction for UV dust attenuation. The simplest conclusion is that the dust attenuation factor is 1. 8 at UV wavelengths. However, this factor is considerably smaller than the standard attenuation factor of ~ 5, normally assumed for LBGs. We discuss potential reasons for this discrepancy, including the possibility that the dust attenuation factor at z ≥ 3 is smaller than at lower redshifts. Conversely, the radio luminosity for a given star formation rate may be systematically lower at very high redshift. Two possible causes for a <b>suppressed</b> <b>radio</b> luminosity are (1) increased inverse Compton cooling of the relativistic electron population due to scattering off the increasing CMB at high redshift or (2) cosmic-ray diffusion from systematically smaller galaxies. The radio detections of individual sources are consistent with a radio-loud AGN fraction of 0. 3 %.

40|$|Context. Continuum radio {{emission}} of galaxies {{is related to}} AGN activity and to starbursts, both of which require a supply of gas, respectively to the central black hole and to molecular clouds. Aims.

Methods. Galaxies in the FLASH and 6 dFGS optical/NIR redshift surveys are cross-identified with NVSS radio sources, selected in a subsample doubly complete in volume and luminosity, and classified as starbursts or AGN according to their radio luminosity. We study radio luminosities as well as radio loudness (luminosities normalized by stellar mass) RK. Environmental effects are studied through a smoothed density field (normalized to that obtained from random catalogs with the same survey edges and redshift selection function) and through the projected distance to the nearest cluster (in units of its virial radius, whose relation to the aperture velocity dispersion is quantified).

Environmental effects are studied through a smoothed density field (normalized with random catalogs with the same survey edges and redshift selection function) and {{the distance to the}} nearest cluster (R/r 200, where r 200 is the virial radius, whose relation to the aperture velocity dispersion is quantified). The fraction of high radio loudness (R_K=L_radio/L_K) galaxies in the 10 Mpc Abell 3558 cluster complex {{at the core of the}} SSC (SSC-CR) is half as large than elsewhere. In the SSC-CR, R_K is anti-correlated with the density of the large-scale environment and correlated with R/r 200 : central brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the SSC-CR are 10 x less radio-loud than BCGs elsewhere, with signs of <b>suppressed</b> <b>radio</b> loudness in the SSC-CR also present beyond the BCGs, out to at least 0. 3 r 200. This correlation is nearly as strong as the tight correlation of L_K with R/r 200 (K-luminosity segregation), inside the SSC-CR. The suppression of radio loudness in SSC-CR BCGs can be attributed to cluster-cluster mergers that destroy the cool core and thus the supply of gas to the central AGN. We analytically demonstrate that the low radio loudness of non-BCG galaxies within SSC-CR clusters cannot be explained by direct major galaxy mergers or rapid galaxy flyby collisions, but by the loss of gas supply through the enhanced ram pressure felt when these galaxies cross the shock front between the 2 merging clusters and are later subjected to the stronger wind from the 2 nd cluster.

40|$|Array {{processing}} proved {{itself in}} the last decades as a powerful approach to <b>suppress</b> harmful <b>radio</b> frequency interference.

Formerly, the vector tracking loops have been shown to deliver superior performance in scenarios with blocked line of sight signals due to aiding of the affected signals during the outage. Since vector tracking loops are susceptible to faked GNSS signals, the proposed receiver architecture also includes a spoofing detection based on the direction of arrival estimation. The paper presents the technical concept and details about the realization of the array-based receiver which was developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR).

This technique {{will be used}} for experiments that observe coherent radio emission from extensive air showers induced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. These experiments are designed to make a detailed study of the development of the electromagnetic part of air showers. Therefore, these radio signals provide information that is complementary to that obtained by water-Cherenkov detectors which are predominantly sensitive to the particle content of an air shower at ground. The radio signals from air showers are caused by the coherent emission due to geomagnetic and charge-excess processes. These emissions can be observed in the frequency band between 10 - 100 MHz. However, this frequency range is significantly contaminated by narrow-band RFI and other human-made distortions. A FIR filter implemented in the FPGA logic segment of the front-end electronics of a radio sensor significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper we discuss an adaptive filter which is based on linear prediction. The coefficients for the linear predictor (LP) are dynamically refreshed and calculated in the embedded NIOS processor, which is implemented in the same FPGA chip. The Levinson recursion, used to obtain the filter coefficients, is also implemented in the NIOS and is partially supported by direct multiplication in the DSP blocks of the logic FPGA segment. Tests confirm that the LP can be an alternative to other methods involving multiple time-to-frequency domain conversions using an FFT procedure. These multiple conversions draw heavily on the power consumption of the FPGA and are avoided by the linear prediction approach. Minimization of the power consumption is an important issue because the final system will be powered by solar panels. The FIR filter has been successfully tested in the Altera development kits with the EP 4 CE 115 F 29 C 7 from the Cyclone IV family and the EP 3 C 120 F 780 C 7 from the Cyclone III family at a 170 MHz sampling rate, a 12 -bit I/O resolution, and an internal 30 -bit dynamic range. Most of the slow floating-point NIOS calculations have been moved to the FPGA logic segments as extended fixed-point operations, which significantly reduced the refreshing time of the coefficients used in the LP. We conclude that the LP is a viable alter-native to other methods such as non-adaptive methods involving digital notch filters or multiple time-to-frequency domain conversions using an FFT procedure. ...|$|R

Normal galaxies with low star-formation rates become radio-faint at high z, because Inverse Compton (IC) losses off the CMB cool CR electrons and positrons rapidly, <b>suppressing</b> their nonthermal <b>radio</b> emission. However, we find that this effect occurs at higher redshifts than previously expected, because escape, bremsstrahlung, ionization, and starlight IC losses act to counter this effect and preserve the radio luminosity of galaxies. The radio dimming of star-forming galaxies at high z {{is not just a}} simple competition between magnetic field energy density and the CMB energy density; the CMB must also compete with every other loss process. We predict relations for the critical redshift when radio emission is significantly suppressed compared to the z ~ 0 FRC as a function of star-formation rate per unit area. Additionally, we provide a quantitative explanation for the relative radio brightness of some high-z submillimeter galaxies. We show that at fixed star formation rate surface density, galaxies with larger CR scale heights are radio bright with respect to the FRC, because of weaker bremsstrahlung and ionization losses compared to compact starbursts. We predict that these "puffy starbursts" should have steeper radio spectra than compact galaxies with the same star-formation rate surface density. We find that radio bright submillimeter galaxies alone cannot explain the excess radio emission reported by ARCADE 2, but they may significantly enhance the diffuse radio background with respect to a naive application of the z ~ 0 FRC.
