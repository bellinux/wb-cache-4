40|$|Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR) is {{the first}} enzyme in the monolignol-specific branch of the lignin biosynthetic pathway. In this research, three sorghum CCR genes {{including}} SbCCR 1, SbCCR 2 - 1 and SbCCR 2 - 2 were cloned and characterized. Analyses of the structure and phylogeny of the three CCR genes showed evolutionary conservation of the functional domains and divergence of function. Transient expression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves demonstrated that the three CCR proteins were localized in the cytoplasm. The expression analysis showed that the three CCR genes were induced by drought. But in 48 h, the expression levels of SbCCR 1 and SbCCR 2 - 2 did not differ between CK and the drought treatment; while the expression level of SbCCR 2 - 1 in the drought treatment was higher than in CK. The expression of the SbCCR 1 and SbCCR 2 - 1 genes was not induced by <b>sorghum</b> <b>aphid</b> [Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner) ] attack, but SbCCR 2 - 2 was significantly induced by <b>sorghum</b> <b>aphid</b> attack. It is suggested that SbCCR 2 - 2 {{is involved in the}} process of pest defense. Absolute quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the three CCR genes were mainly expressed in lignin deposition organs. The gene copy number of SbCCR 1 was significantly higher than those of SbCCR 2 - 1 and SbCCR 2 - 2 in the tested tissues, especially in stem. The results provide new insight into the functions of the three CCR genes in sorghum...|$|E
40|$|Four-strip small syrphid fly, Paragus quadri-fasciatus Meigen is the {{important}} natural enemy of aphids in our region. A fly can eat about 800 aphids during its whole life. There are more than 10 kinds of aphids can be food of this fly, such as soybean aphid, Chinese <b>sorghum</b> <b>aphid</b> and radish aphid etc. The fly has 3 ~ 4 generations each year in Tonghua county, Jilin province. The adult {{of the first generation}} appears after the last ten-day period of April each year. It takes 30 ~ 35 days to complete one generation. The fly can oviposit 84 ~ 124 eggs in its whole life.

40|$|Abstract—Feeding by the aphid Sipha flava {{produces}} a reddish spot on mature leaves of Sorghum halepense. The present work {{is aimed at}} determining whether this plant response entails induced resistance against the aphid. Old and young leaves showed the same response to aphid feeding (reddish coloration). Water-stressed plants displayed a similar reddish coloration to aphid-infested plants. This was verified by evaluation of absorbance peaks of the respective leaf extracts. Aphid fecundity was reduced on previously infested (and hence reddish colored) leaves. However, aphid fecundity was not affected on water stressed plants. Furthermore, aphid survival was not different on artificial diets containing increasing concentrations of the reddish pigment. It is concluded that the reddish spot is correlated with, but is not itself responsible for, the observed induced resistance of S. halepense against S. flava.

40|$|Abstract. An {{integrated}} {{pest management}} (IPM) approach that relies on an array of tactics is adopted commonly in response to problems with pesticide-based production in many agricultural systems. Host plant resistance is often used as a fundamental component of an IPM system because of the generally compatible, complementary role that pest-resistant crops play with other tactics. Recent research and development in the resistance of legumes and cereals to <b>aphids,</b> <b>sorghum</b> midge resistance, and the resistance of canola varieties to mite and insect pests have shown the prospects of host plant resistance for developing IPM strategies against invertebrate pests in Australian grain crops. Furthermore, continuing advances in biotechnology provide the opportunity of using transgenic plants to enhance host plant resistance in grains...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{significant}} {{question in}} biological control {{is the extent}} to which indigenous natural enemies might be pre-adapted to exploit invasive species that constitute novel prey. We observed the recruitment of natural enemies to aphid microcosms – pots containing four sorghum plants infested with either Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner), a newly invasive aphid, or Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), an established pest. The first cohort was monitored in open habitat along a tree line near riparian parkland and urban plantings, and the second, within a <b>sorghum</b> monoculture. Both <b>aphid</b> species were eliminated by natural enemies within 13 days in the first cohort, but in the second, M. sacchari reached higher numbers than S. graminum and survived a week longer. Biological control was successful in both cases; neither aphid produced a generation of alates, nor did plants sustain significant damage. Syrphid larvae, primarily Allograpta obliqua (Say), caused most aphid mortality in the first cohort, whereas adult Coccinellidae, primarily Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville, caused most mortality in the second. Eggs and larvae of Chrysoperla carnea Stephens were present in both cohorts, but appeared to suffer more intraguild predation in the first. Flower flies and velvet mites were present only in the first cohort, and flower bugs, only in the second. Aphelinus sp. successfully parasitized both aphids, but Lysiphlebus testaceipes Cresson did not develop in M. sacchari due to their infection with the secondary endosymbiont Hamiltonella defensa (confirmed by DNA analysis). Thus, sorghum infested with M. sacchari attracted the same guild of natural enemies as S. graminum and had similar biological control outcomes. The findings suggest that the capacity of indigenous aphidophagous guilds to respond to, and ultimately control, invasive aphid species may be underestimated...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how plant resistance, by mediating herbivore number, affects the surivorship of the immature stages of a natural enemy. It was hypothesized that survivorship would initially increase and then saturate with decreased resistance and, thus, increased herbivore number. This hypothesis was tested in a maize agro-ecosystem composed of differentially resistant maize genotypes (DIMBOA-based resistance), the corn leaf aphid Rhopalosiphum maidis (Homoptera: Aphididae), and ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). The effect of plant stress on the survivorship of ladybird larvae was also investigated. Stress was imposed by either increasing plant density or by varying nitrogen supply. A preliminary laboratory experiment indicated that DIMBOA did not influence the development of larvae of the ladybird Propylea quatuordecimpunctata fed aphids from a high DIMBOA genotype, but the combination of plant stress and resistance significantly increased pupal development time by about half a day (Chapter III). Mature ladybirds showed a significant preference for non-infested stressed greenhouse grown plants transferred to the field (Chapter IV). However, in the presence of aphids, the reproductive response of ladybirds in the field was related to peak aphid number, not to plant appearance per se when plant were nitrogen stressed (Chapter V). In the greenhouse, a 2 -fold increase in DIMBOA concentration was observed in stressed plants of a high DIMBOA genotype, whereas no significant variation was found between non-stressed and stressed plants of both intermediate and low DIMBOA genotypes (Chapter II). The increase in DIMBOA concentration in stressed plants of the high DIMBOA genotype did not result in increased resistance to aphids in the laboratory because this genotype was already highly resistant. However, plant stress significantly decreased the growth of aphid colonies on the low DIMBOA genotype. In the field, variations in peak aphid number, with respect to maize genotype and to plant stress, were consistent with laboratory results. (Chapter V). Thus, the deployment of intermediate or high DIMBOA genotypes can be considered to be stable strategies against aphids in this system. In the field, the reproductive response of ladybirds saturated rapidly with respect to peak aphid number. However, the survivorship of immature ladybirds did not saturate, as predicted. Although survivorship initially increased with peak aphid number, as predicted, it decreased rapidly with further increase in peak aphid number. Two laboratory experiments were performed to isolate factors thought to be important in shaping the survivorship of ladybird larvae. The first experiment (Chapter VI), in which encounter rate among larvae and alternative food source were controlled for, indicated that cannibalism occurred readily and was density-dependent. In the second experiment (Chapter VII), small cages containing one sorghum (<b>Sorghum</b> vulgare) plant, <b>aphid</b> colonies of different size, and an increasing number of ladybird larvae were used. The pattern observed in the field was confirmed in this fully factorial experiment. The results suggest that an intermediate resistance strategy opens a window of stability in agro-ecosystems in which aphids are the consumers and ladybird beetles are the predators.
