50|$|<b>Snap</b> <b>peas,</b> {{like all}} other peas, are pod fruits. An edible-podded pea {{is similar to a}} garden, or English, pea, but the pod is less fibrous, and edible when young. Pods of the edible-podded pea, {{including}} <b>snap</b> <b>peas,</b> do not have a membrane and do not open when ripe. At maturity, the pods grow to around 4-8 cm in length, Pods contain three to eight peas per pod. The plants are climbing, and pea sticks or a trellis or other support system is required for optimal growth. Some cultivars are capable of climbing to 2 m high but are more commonly around 1-1.3 m for ease of harvest.|$|E

40|$|In plant cells, {{antioxidants}} keep reactive {{oxygen species}} at low concentrations, avoiding oxidative damage while allowing them to play crucial functions in signal transduction. However, {{little is known about}} the role of antioxidants during fruit maturation, especially in legumes. <b>Snap</b> <b>pea</b> (Pisum sativum) plants, which have edible fruits, were grown under nodulating and non-nodulating conditions. Fruits were classified in three maturity stages and antioxidants were determined in the seeds and seedless pods. Maturation or prolonged storage of fruits at 25 °C led to a decline in antioxidant activities and metabolites and in γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase protein. Notable exceptions were superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione peroxidase protein, which increased in one or both of these processes. During maturation, cytosolic peroxiredoxin decreased in seeds but increased in pods, and ascorbate oxidase activity was largely reduced in seeds. In stored fruits, ascorbate oxidase activity was nearly abolished in seeds but doubled in pods. It is concluded that symbiotic nitrogen fixation is as effective as nitrogen fertilization in maintaining the antioxidant capacity of pea fruits and that, contrary to climacteric fruits, a general decrease in antioxidants during maturation does not involve oxidative stress. Results underscore the importance of the antioxidant system in reproductive organs and point to ascorbate–glutathione metabolism and cytosolic peroxiredoxin as key players in pea fruit development...|$|R

40|$|Project Objective The {{purpose of}} this project was to design a method for {{screening}} Syngenta <b>snap</b> <b>pea</b> varieties for the neoplastic podded gene (np). Pea varieties will be characterized phenotypically using weevil extracts to produce a neoplasm response of the np gene. Screening for neoplasms will enable the breeding team to understand if the gene is present how it {{might or might not}} be affecting pod quality reductions. Project Outcomes and Significance The most important outcome was discovered during the proof of concept phase of protocol creation when it was established that the np gene is likely not the gene causing pod quality reductions. This is very significant because it eliminates a variable and allows for focus on other potential causes. A second outcome was the fact that weevil extracts were not needed to verify if the np gene was present. Based on the initial work with the check varieties, the low light environment of the greenhouse was a very consistent inducer of the neoplasm response. Both a low light and a weevil extract protocol are included in this project. The weevil protocol is still a valid approach and was the initial direction for the project. The low light protocol is the more practical option for the breeding program and will be what is used this fall to verify that the np gene is in fact not the issue. A third outcome was finding a direction for the next steps in the long term investigation into pod quality. A field in Washington was exposed to severe sand damage that had many of the same characteristics as the damage seen in California. Further testing will be conducted to explore sand damage and its impact on pod quality...|$|R
50|$|BPMV is the viral {{pathogen}} {{that causes the}} disease Bean Pod Mottle in soybeans and other legumes such as <b>snap</b> <b>peas.</b> BPMV is a species in the plant pathogenic virus family Comoviridae, and genus Comovirus characterized by icosahedral symmetry, non-enveloped, having two single stranded positive-sense RNAs (RNA-1 and RNA-2) separately encapsulated in isomeric particles, and are between 28 and 30 nm in diameter. (Bradshaw, 2007). The virus can overwinter in leaf-feeding beetle vectors (such as the bean leaf beetle), survive in perennial host species, and in virus-infected seed. In the North Central Region, the bean leaf beetle (Cerotoma trifurcate) is the most influential vector, by feeding on infected legumes and transferring virus particles to the next plant it lands on to feed.|$|E
50|$|Although {{they will}} consume {{a wide variety}} of foods if offered, green iguanas are {{naturally}} herbivorous and require a precise ratio of minerals (2 to 1 calcium to phosphorus) in their diet. The best food source for the Iguana is dark green leafy greens such as collard greens, turnip greens, dandelion greens and small portions of kale, which is too high in phosphorus for everyday use. Hibiscus flowers and dandelions may also be added. The diet needs to be a greater percentage of dark greens, moderate amount of squash, and less of fruits. Some of the most accessible staple vegetables, greens, and fruit are collard greens, Turnip Greens, Kale, Parsnip, Butternut squash, Tomato, Mango, Blueberries, Watermelon, and an occasional Apple or Banana slice and Watercress as a treat. Also of concern is the oxalate to calcium ratio, and avoiding those that provide too much oxalate which is harmful. Foods high in oxalate should be avoided or given very seldomly, examples are Broccoli, Carrots, Green beans, <b>Snap</b> <b>peas,</b> Okra, Sweet Potato, and Romaine lettuce. An Iguana should never be fed Iceberg lettuce, Spinach, Parsley, and Cilantro.|$|E

40|$|Multi-sensory {{nutrition}} education interventions aimed at promoting children’s preferences for vegetables {{have the potential}} to positively impact children’s intake of essential micronutrients and phytochemicals. We implemented our intervention in Western Massachusetts Head Start preschool classrooms, as part of Massachusetts Farm Fresh research project.

During the 4 -week intervention, eight vegetables were matched by appearance and growing process to create vegetable pairs (green bean-sugar <b>snap</b> <b>pea,</b> broccoli-cauliflower, beet-radish, and carrot-parsnip). Each week, two animal puppets introduced the children in the classroom to the vegetable pairs by highlighting the vegetable’s color, shape, texture, and growth process. Complete baseline and follow-up consumption data were available for 60 three to five year old children. Total mean consumption (g) increased pre-post intervention (pre: 14. 75 + 1. 38 vs. post: 17. 83 + 2. 05 g) (p= 0. 06).

30|$|The {{following}} {{narrative is}} included {{in this article as}} it links the video data example to family activity in order to clarify the cultural milieu of Luci’s family. Prior to capturing the mobile phone video data, a family gathering around a dinner table makes a connection between Luci’s counting experience (Wagoner 2017) and her transitory symbolic play moment with the felt necklace. The context for the connection is the family home where Luci is sitting on her aunt’s knee around a dinner table. Aunt begins a guessing game by taking a sugar <b>snap</b> <b>pea</b> from a bowl and asking how many peas in the pod? Aunt playfully holds the pea pod up to her own face to pretend it’s an upwardly curving smile. Luci smiles and watches her Aunt intently. Luci has been opening the pea pods herself and feeding on the peas inside, not thinking about how many peas are in each pod. Luci looks at Aunt’s pea pod and answers ‘two’ and when the pod is opened she sees that there are indeed two peas in the pod. Luci’s face lights up with a huge smile and with a glancing gesture to her family around the dinner table she sees their nods and looks of beaming recognition, as they acknowledge she correctly guessed the number of peas. Luci has an understanding of what ‘two’ can be; in this case, two peas in a pod. In the light of this small story, the notion that Vygotsky (2004, 7 – 97) considered creative activity is based on the ability of the brain to combine elements, fits very well: “whenever a person imagines, combines, alters, and creates something new, no matter how small, this thing appears …compared to the work of others.” Luci has configured a new thing (two-ness) in her home situation. Davydov (2008) had observed that: “A person's conscious activity is mediated by the collective” (p. 31). Past collective mediations such as those learned around the dinner table, are implicitly present in collective memory. In this way when Luci brings past collectively mediated experiences to her present handling of the felt beads, she already remembers and understands that counting is useful and valued in her family life (White and Dalli 2017). Vygotsky (1994) notes in relation to cultural development of the child: “the amount remembered is determined by the degree of his [her] attention, by the amount of his individual memory and by the measure of his interest in the matter” (p. 64).|$|R

We find that participation in export supply chains increases producers' household per capita income. We also find evidence that these effects may vary from one type of export supply chains to the other and are mainly driven by HVESC, which confirms that participation in export supply chains may have varying effects depending on individual circumstances and participation conditions. We also disaggregate the analysis with respect to the producers' farm size and income level and find evidence that richer and larger producers benefit from supplying the HVESC while supplying the RESC can increase the household per capita income of some poorer producers...|$|E

We conducted a 6 -week multi-sensory nutrition education intervention with Western Massachusetts Head Start preschoolers (3 - 5 years of age; n= 94 children) using eight vegetable pairs; outcome measures were recorded by observers. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20. 0. Results are reported for 50 children with complete data at both baseline and follow-up. Willingness improved from baseline (40 - 50 % of children = SCORE O) to follow-up (20 - 40 % = SCORE 0) for all vegetables. Willingness scores (1) increased for “lower-sugar” vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, green bean, radish) (p=. 013) (2) were lower for white vegetables (cauliflower, parsnip) versus the other color categories (red, green, orange) and (3) were higher for both pod (sugar <b>snap</b> <b>peas,</b> green beans) and long-root (carrot, parsnip) versus root vegetables (beet, radish).

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 While {{previous}} {{research has suggested that}} bitterness is the key determinant of vegetable disliking, it is unknown what role odor plays in vegetable hedonics. We therefore investigated the impact of odor as well as taste on liking and disliking of four vegetables (steamed asparagus and Brussels sprouts; fresh celery and <b>snap</b> <b>peas).</b> To minimize the visual and textural cues, the vegetables were finely chopped. Subjects (N= 132) tasted the samples with the nose open and also with the nose closed and rated the degree of liking/disliking as well as perceived intensities of sweetness, bitterness, saltiness, and vegetable flavor on the LHS and gLMS, respectively. Subjects were classified as 'likers' or 'dislikers' of each vegetable based on the valence of their hedonic ratings under the nose open condition (i. e., when retronasal odors could be perceived). The degree to which 'likers' liked and 'dislikers' disliked the specific vegetables was significantly less (p< 0. 05) in the nose closed condition, indicating that odor was a significant driver of vegetable hedonics. Importantly, perceived vegetable odor intensity did not differ significantly between 'likers' and 'dislikers' for most of the vegetables, suggesting that the quality of vegetable odors, but not their perceived intensity, generally drove hedonic ratings. In contrast, taste intensity ratings measured in the nose closed condition sometimes differed significantly (p< 0. 05) between 'likers' and 'dislikers', but not in a consistent manner across vegetables. More importantly, perceived bitterness ratings measured in the nose closed condition did not differ significantly between 'likers' and 'dislikers' for any vegetable. However, specific vegetable 'dislikers' rated the perceived bitterness higher than 'likers' in the presence of retronasal odor, especially for those "bitter" vegetables, which implies that bitterness is often confused with the odor of vegetable in the normal tasting condition. In order to further investigate the role that specific odors play on liking and disliking of vegetables, a follow-up experiment was conducted. Returning subjects sampled and rated the degree of liking/disliking of the odor of the 4 test vegetables, which were presented retronasally and orthonasally in the absence of other sensory cues. Degree of retronasal odor liking was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) for the specific vegetable 'likers' than by their 'disliker' counterparts for the 4 vegetables. Degree of orthonasal odor liking was also significantly higher (p< 0. 05) for asparagus and snap pea 'likers' than their 'dislikers', but no such difference was found for the other two vegetables tested. Overall, these results suggest that odor, especially retronasal odor, is a significant driver of vegetable liking and disliking, while tastes of vegetables play a lesser role...|$|E
40|$|Root {{diseases}} {{caused by}} soil-borne pathogens are often main constraints in legume crop production. Changes towards organic farming practices have recently {{contributed to an}} increase in legume cropping, mainly for nitrogen supply purposes, and these have raised concerns about unacceptable build-up of soil-borne pathogen inocula. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of frequent legume cropping on such inocula build-up, and had emphasis on Aphanomyces euteiches, an important pathogen causing pea root rot in Sweden. Field experiments with legume monocultures were established, and the effect of these monocultures on disease development and yields in subsequent pea, broad bean and snap bean was measured. Isolates of Aphanomyces spp., from several legumes, were tested for host ranges and characterised by means of morphological, biochemical and molecular methods. A survey of legume-specific soil-borne pathogens in fields under frequent legume cropping in northern Spain was also undertaken. Several legumes were found to be hosts for A. euteiches, and this pathogen was isolated from field-grown alfalfa, <b>snap</b> bean, <b>pea,</b> sweet clover and vetch. The Swedish isolates of A. euteiches were assigned two putative pathotypes, pea- and vetch-specific. Other species of Aphanomyces had a wide host range among legumes, but these did not induce disease symptoms. Sequencing of ITS 1 - 5. 8 S - ITS 2 rDNA region and RFLP of AT-rich DNA allowed appropriate delineation of these Aphanomyces spp. Monocultures of the tested legume crops affected the inoculum potential of A. euteiches differently. <b>Pea,</b> broad bean, <b>snap</b> bean, vetch and sweet clover were almost equally efficient in inoculum build-up and markedly affected subsequent pea and broad bean yields. Monocultures of alfalfa, birdsfoot trefoil, red, white, and Persian clover had lower impact on disease development and yields in subsequent crops. Thielaviopsis basicola and Rhizoctonia solani were the most prevalent pathogens in <b>pea</b> and <b>snap</b> bean fields in Spain and significantly affected yield. Climatic factors and soil properties favoured prevalence of these pathogens in Spain, whereas A. euteiches was most prevalent under Swedish conditions. It is concluded that intensive legume cropping will, on many soil types not be sustainable in the long-term due to the build-up of soil-borne pathogen inoculum...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to type genetic {{variants}} in the casein genes in Czech dairy goat population and to assess an association within genotypes group at the casein loci on the following milk production parameters: mean daily milk yield, protein yield, and protein production during 240 -days milking in 389 animals of Czech mixed dairy goat breeds in first till third lactation. Different molecular techniques: AS-PCR, PCR-RFLP and <b>PEA</b> (<b>SNaP</b> Shot) were used to determine genetic variants. Molecular analysis confirmed that the F (0. 622) allele at CSN 1 S 1 locus was predominant compared to the A allele and prevalent genotype was FA (0. 524). At CSN 2 locus allele C was predominant (0. 669) compared to A allele (0. 331) and genotype AC (0. 486) and CC (0. 427) had similar appearance. Frequency of allele F and N was similar (0. 478, 0. 522, respectively) at CSN 1 S 2 locus. Frequencies of allele B (0. 765) and genotype BB (0. 619) at the CSN 3 locus were dominant in goat population. Associations between milk production parameters and casein gene polymorphism were investigated, and significant effects were found on protein content, at loci CSN 1 S 1, CSN 1 S 2, CSN 3 (P < 0. 001), and CSN 2 (P < 0. 05). Also, significant effect was found on protein production at 240 d of lactation at locus CSN 3. These results indicate that casein genetic polymorphism loci should be used as a molecular marker for marker-assisted selection (MAS) for improving of milk composition and protein production...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Small broomrape, a holoparasitic weed, is a {{relatively}} new weed introduction in the Pacific Northwest that has contaminated a limited number of red clover fields in Oregon. Greenhouse and field studies were conducted to evaluate small broomrape response to common crop and weed species in the Pacific Northwest. Host species in the greenhouse or field study included alfalfa, arrowleaf clover, carrot, celery, common vetch, crimson clover, lettuce, prickly lettuce, red clover, spotted catsear, subterranean clover, white clover, and wild carrot. False-host species included barley, birdsfoot trefoil, creeping bentgrass, cucumber, field corn, fine fescue, flax, Italian ryegrass, nasturtium, oat, orchardgrass, perennial ryegrass, <b>snap</b> bean, sugar <b>pea,</b> sunflower, sweet corn, tall fescue, tomato, and wheat. Non-host species included sugar beet and curly dock. The greenhouse polyethylene bag system provided a rapid and inexpensive screening for plant species host status to small broomrape. Germination and attachment to host roots are initiated by chemical exudates, that may change concentration in response to nutrient availability and microorganisms. Red clover was grown in varying concentrations of ammonium sulfate fertilizer with and without Rhizobium inoculation, and with small broomrape seeds. Neither Rhizobium inoculation nor ammonium concentration influenced the number of small broomrape attachments to red clover roots. A survey was conducted of red clover seed growers with small broomrape-contaminated fields in the Pacific Northwest. Red clover seed from six respondents were cleaned at the same cleaning facility, and the same respondents purchased their seed stock from this cleaning facility. Small broomrape was not identified in red clover fields prior to or during the first clover seed harvest of fall planted red clover in small broomrape-contaminated sites...|$|R
