Bringing Russia to an equal level with the rest of Europe intellectually was a major concern of Catherine's. For this reason she created laws that justified her rule.|$|E

Badland explained that Babe regrets encouraging Abi, saying [...] "She got a bit over-enthusiastic and she gave her bad advice. Babe saw herself in Abi and <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to help her." [...] Abi's attempt at getting pregnant is unsuccessful so when Abi suffers a fall in The Vic, Babe persuades Abi to fake a miscarriage. This leaves Ben [...] "crushed" [...] when he learns of Abi's miscarriage. This plot twist was criticised by Zoe Clark-Coates, co-founder and CEO of The Mariposa Trust, who said, [...] "To regularly see TV shows using fake miscarriages as light entertainment could make people question genuine losses." ...|$|E

The film's settings vary in cities throughout the United States, which Cyrus thought she could capture in the song. [...] "Not just make it something that sounds from Hollywood and really produced, but we could add a little country twang to it," [...] she said. Cyrus said the writing process was easy. Before the song's completion, Travolta agreed to sing it, believing [...] "Well, it will be a cute song, whatever it is." [...] After listening to the song, he was surprised at Cyrus' songwriting abilities. [...] "She's really gifted at writing, and <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to write something good for me as the character Bolt, so she went out of her way with her writing partner to come up with something good, and I really think they pulled it off", Travolta told MTV News.|$|E

Roger Ebert, while critical of the film itself, wrote that Kunis [...] "brings her role to within shouting distance of credibility." [...] Director Mike Judge commented {{that part of what}} was surprising to learn about Kunis was her ability to make references to the cult animation film Rejected. Judge said: [...] "As beautiful as Mila is, you could believe that maybe she would cross paths with you in the real world." [...] After seeing Kunis perform in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Judge wanted to cast her in the role of Cindy in Extract: [...] "I just thought, 'Wow, this girl's perfect.'

[...] Kunis herself stated that [...] "I'm a huge fan of Mike Judge's from Office Space, so I was, like, 'Okay, this is a very easy decision.'

2500|$|Incumbent Bob Parker {{announced}} 14 {{months prior}} to the election that he would seek a third term as mayor. There was much speculation for many months over who would challenge Parker. Dalziel's name was persistently mentioned, but she denied any interest, declaring instead that the job that <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> is Gerry Brownlee's as Earthquake Recovery Minister, rather than Bob Parker's. Three first term councillors were also rumoured, with Tim Carter seen as the most likely to come forward. In April 2013, Christchurch's main newspaper, The Press, announced that Dalziel would stand, having asked Student Volunteer Army organiser Sam Johnson to be her running mate. This caused surprise since Dalziel and Johnson are from opposite ends of the political spectrum, but he declined the invitation anyway. It was not until mid June that Dalziel confirmed her candidacy. At the same time, serious problems developed at Christchurch City Council (CCC) over building consent issues, which led to Parker withdrawing his candidacy and council's chief executive, Tony Marryatt, losing his job. In early August, central city retail manager Paul Lonsdale announced his candidacy and was immediately credited by The Press as the most viable alternative to Dalziel, but senior journalist Lois Cairns predicted the following day that Lonsdale [...] "will come in a distant second". Dalziel, the former Labour Party MP for Christchurch East and up to the election the representative of the Christchurch East electorate, had been in Parliament since [...] and was considered the top favourite. Of the remaining ten candidates, The Press labelled them a mixture of eccentrics, tryers and also-rans.|$|E

So there's a lot of dancing in the video, but I wouldn’t say it's necessarily centered around that." [...] When asked about the '80s-inspired visuals seen on the candids from the video shoot, she explained that it would have a narrative and stated that Britney wanted to do a video where she got to dress up and play a character. Azalea revealed she looked to actress Geena Davis when modeling her style, describing her as [...] "the ultimate '80s pin-up hot, cool type of girl" [...] that Britney also liked. Spears added, [...] "I had called my manager and had some ideas about doing a Valley girl-type video. It was really kind of funny, because I had just watched Clueless on TV, and was like, 'It would be so fun to do something like that.' Then I saw Iggy's video, and I thought, 'Oh my God, to work with her would be heaven sent.'" [...] They brainstormed the concept for the video, deciding on a send-up of 1988 sci-fi comedy Earth Girls Are Easy, which starred Davis. Spears said, [...] "I do a makeover for her and we go to a club. The best part about it was just us coming together with the clothes and doing the '80s haircuts. We were all about being characters, so it was kind of funny for us. We weren't taking ourselves so seriously".|$|E

She performed as the opening act at his Sakis on the Waves beach concert and the two eventually recorded a duet together, also written by Dimitris Kontopoulos, with MAD TV adding that the song's theme would provoke reaction. It was widely reported that the duet would appear on his new studio album, however a little before the release of Iparhi Agapi Edo, MAD TV reported that the track had been cut from the album with no explanation why. While at first it was unknown whether this new duet was indeed that song, it became apparent that it was not as in the aforementioned track Rouvas was the lead artist, as well as that this new track was recorded in 2009. Since 2006, the two artists did not find any further opportunity to collaborate until 2009, when Rouvas chose Tamta as his main supporting act for his winter 20092010 season concert series, eventually revealed to be at the newly renovated The S Club, where Rouvas is the owner. Thus, [...] "Tharros I Alitheia" [...] was also recorded in promotion of their shows. Tamta expressed how much <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to collaborate with Rouvas: [...] "It was something that I wanted very much.
