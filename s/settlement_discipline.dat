5000|$|He was {{reputed to}} be a strict disciplinarian, and in 1844 arrived as commandant of Norfolk Island to replace Alexander Maconochie whose {{progressive}} views on penal administration {{were thought to be}} unsuitable for this establishment. However, Childs proved to be no match for the convict 'old hands'. His 'strict discipline' may have worked on the thoroughly disciplined men of the Royal Marines, but he had no experience of life in a penal <b>settlement.</b> General <b>discipline</b> was poor, and left to subordinate guards and overseers who had little control over the prison which was ruled by the 'Ring' of hardened convicts. A visiting magistrate reported that while Childs was [...] "a most amiable benevolent gentleman and honorable officer" [...] what was needed to avoid anarchy and insubordination was [...] "an officer of experience in, or capacity for, government, judgement, energy, decision and firmness". Childs was recalled but, before he left, a group of convicts revolted in July 1846, murdering four officials. Thirteen convicts were convicted of murder and hanged by Childs' successor, John Price, who considered Childs responsible for the state of affairs that led to the revolt. A newspaper report at the time blamed the situation on Childs' [...] "utter imbecility".|$|R
