Due to the patient’s {{numerous}} strains, the necessity of two gynaecological operations, and treatment of broken bones, adrenalectomy was contraindicated for 2 years. After that time, {{the size of the}} tumour reached 18 cm × 12 cm. The patient was selected for laparoscopic adrenalectomy, which was successful. The size of the tumour and performed abdominal surgery did not constitute substantial obstacles, and the less invasive procedure was additionally justified by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging results, which demonstrated a benign lesion...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of patients with head and neck paragangliomas (HNPGL) have biochemically silent tumours. Chromogranin A (CgA) is a tumour marker for neuroendocrine tumours. To assess the role of CgA as a tumour marker in patients with hereditary HNPGL. We included 95 consecutive patients with hereditary HNPGL for screening of plasma CgA levels and catecholamine excess by measurement of 24 -h urinary excretion of (nor) metanephrine, (nor) adrenaline, VMA, dopamine and 3 -methoxytyramine. In all patients with catecholamine excess, abdominal/intrathoracic paragangliomas were excluded by (123) I-MIBG scintigraphy, MRI and/or CT. Plasma CgA levels were increased in only 15 of 95 patients (16 %). Thirty-three of the 95 patients (35 %) had increased urinary excretion rates of catecholamines. Six of these 33 patients (18 %) had increased plasma CgA levels. Nine of the 62 patients (15 %) with a biochemically <b>silent</b> <b>tumour,</b> i. e. no increased urinary excretion of catecholamines or their metabolites, had increased CgA levels. Increased plasma CgA levels were positively correlated with urinary excretion rates of noradrenaline (r =  0 · 68, P =  0 · 005) and normetanephrine (r =  0 · 68, P =  0 · 005).

40|$|Neurogenic tumours of the {{mediastinum}} {{are most}} commonly {{present in the}} posterior mediastinal compartment. Schwannomas, being the most frequently encountered type, can be either benign or malignant, although the former is more common. They typically appear as an asymptomatic mass on radiographic imaging. These tumours with spindle-shaped cells are often asymptomatic, and are routinely detected on standard pulmonary radiography. However, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, especially for posterior mediastinal tumours, provide additional information and help to determine its possible extension to adjacent structures. Therefore, radiographic and histopathological examinations are vital diagnostic tools in the detection of these <b>silent</b> <b>tumours.</b> Complete surgical resection using video-assisted thoracic surgical technique is the mainstay of treatment, and offers an excellent prognosis...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Anecdotal {{reports have}} {{suggested}} that <b>silent</b> corticotroph <b>tumours</b> behave in an aggressive fashion; however, clear comparative data with other non-functioning adenomas (NFAs) are lacking. The aims of the study were, first, to review {{the natural history of}} those non-functioning pituitary adenomas with positive immunoreactivity for ACTH and secondly, to determine whether this subgroup behave more aggressively than ACTH immunonegative NFAs by means of comparison with existing departmental data. METHODS AND PATIENTS: Twenty-eight patients (16 men, mean age 51. 3 years) who underwent transsphenoidal surgery in Oxford between 1975 and 2001 for clinically non-functioning adenomas where the subsequent immunostaining was positive for ACTH were identified from the patient database. All patients with <b>silent</b> corticotroph <b>tumours</b> who presented during this time period have been included in the analysis; three of the patients have subsequently died but none have been lost to follow-up. The mean follow-up period was 7. 4 years (range 0. 5 - 26. 9 years) and the results were compared with departmental data for NFAs which were immunonegative for ACTH. None of the patients had clinical evidence of Cushing's syndrome. Tumour invasiveness was classified according to the modified Hardy criteria (Grade 1 = microadenoma (1 cm) +/- suprasellar extension, Grade 3 = local invasion with bony destruction and tumour in sphenoid/cavernous sinus and Grade 4 = central nervous system (CNS) spread or extracranial spread, i. e. metastatic). Tumour recurrence was defined as an increase in tumour size compared with the first postoperative scan which was used as a baseline. Visual field defects were documented in 79 % of the 28 patients at presentation compared to 69 % in the non-functioning population as a whole (P = 0. 3). The preoperative imaging in the silent corticotroph group (13 CT, 14 MRI and one air encephalogram) revealed 68 % Grade 2 and 32 % Grade 3 adenomas. RESULTS: The recurrence rate in the ACTH immunopositive tumours was 32 % at a mean of 5. 8 years (range 1 - 16 years) which was not significantly different from the 33 % recurrence rate previously recorded in the ACTH immunonegative tumours (P = 0. 9). Two of the patients with silent corticotroph adenomas have suffered multiple recurrences; one patient has had three operations and two courses of radiotherapy for two episodes of recurrence and one patient has had four operations, two courses of radiotherapy and gamma knife therapy after three recurrences in total. In contrast, no patient with an ACTH immunonegative tumour has required more than one course of treatment for tumour regrowth. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first single-centre comparative study of a series of clinically <b>silent</b> ACTH immunopositive <b>tumours</b> and has demonstrated that although they do not recur more often than ACTH immunonegative tumours, when they do regrow they show a more aggressive course. The practical implication of this {{is that there is no}} evidence for different postoperative imaging and radiotherapy protocols for ACTH immunopositive and immunonegative NFAs at initial presentation. However, if regrowth of a <b>silent</b> corticotroph <b>tumour</b> does occur then very careful monitoring is essential, after further treatment...|$|R
40|$|Jack Ruby, {{the assassin}} of Lee Harvey Oswald, has been {{consigned}} to a footnote of history. What Ruby {{did was to}} eliminate the only man who could explain {{the assassination of the}} US President, setting in train a mass conspiracy delusion that continues to cast doubt on the likely assassin to this day. Who was Jack Ruby, and what motivated him to do this murder that changed history? Ruby 2 ̆ 7 s fragmenting Jewish identity {{played a significant role in}} the events that led to the killing of Oswald and the loss of his sanity. In the year prior to the Kennedy visit, his mental state was changing. In a paranoid state, Ruby 2 ̆ 7 s behaviour was driven by a belief that there was an anti-Jewish conspiracy behind the killing of the President. In addition, his use of dietary amphetamines increased. Ruby 2 ̆ 7 s trial, followed by his time in prison until his death several years later, was characterised by increasingly irrational utterances that were filtered through his Jewish identity. A review of the evidence shows that organic factors affected his mental state. Ruby 2 ̆ 7 s killing of Oswald reflected aspects of the American Jewish migrant experience, his dysfunctional personality, abuse of amphetamines and the probably effect of a <b>silent</b> brain <b>tumour...</b>|$|R
40|$|Pituitary adenomas are {{a common}} manifestation of {{multiple}} endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) {{but most of them}} occur sporadically. There are only a few well defined genetic abnormalities known to occur in these sporadic tumours. The MEN 1 gene located on 11 q 13 has recently been cloned and allelic deletion and mutation analysis studies have implicated the MEN 1 gene in a significant fraction of the sporadic counterparts of typical MEN 1 neoplasms (parathyroid tumours, insulinomas and gastrinomas). To determine if MEN 1 gene inactivation is also involved in the development of sporadic pituitary adenomas, allelic deletions of chromosome 11 q 13 and MEN 1 gene mutations and polymorphisms were assessed in 35 sporadic tumours of the anterior pituitary (9 prolactin-secreting, 8 GH-secreting, 3 TSH-secreting, 2 TSH/GH-secreting, 4 Cushing, 9 <b>silent).</b> Thirty-one <b>tumours</b> were found to be heterozygous for at least one MEN 1 intragenic polymorphism (25 cases) or for a flanking gene polymorphism (6 cases). The remaining tumours were not informative. No mutations were found in any tumour except in one prolactinoma which was homozygous or hemizygous for a mutation (1 – 117 C!T) in a region close to the promoter. Unfortunately, blood or normal tissue was not available in this case. Our data show that somatic MEN 1 mutations do not contribute significantly to tumorigenesis of sporadic pituitary adenomas and suggest that mutation of other genes are likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of these tumours.
