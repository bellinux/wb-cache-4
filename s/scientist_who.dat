40|$|We {{show that}} WWI and the {{subsequent}} boycott against Central scientists severely interrupted international scientific cooperation. After 1914, citations to recent research from abroad decreased and paper titles became less similar (evaluated by Latent Semantic Analysis), suggesting a reduction in international knowledge flows. Reduced international scientific cooperation led {{to a decline in}} the production of basic science and its application in new technology. Specifically, we compare productivity changes for <b>scientists</b> <b>who</b> relied on frontier research from abroad, to changes for <b>scientists</b> <b>who</b> relied on frontier research from home. After 1914, <b>scientists</b> <b>who</b> relied on frontier research from abroad published fewer papers in top scientific journals, produced less Nobel Prize-nominated research, introduced fewer novel scientific words, and introduced fewer novel words that appeared in the text of subsequent patent grants.
