50|$|This type of weld {{is usually}} {{accomplished}} with an arc or MIG welder. It {{can also be}} accomplished <b>by</b> <b>brazing.</b> With arc welding, after the butt weld is complete, the weld itself needs to be struck with a hammer forge to remove slag (a type of waste material) before any subsequent welds can be applied. This is not necessary for MIG welds however, as a protective gas removes any need for slag to appear. Another with a MIG welder is that a continuous copper coated wire is fed onto the stock, making the weld virtually inexhaustible.|$|R
