40|$|Abstract Bolted {{end-plate}} steel connections {{have become}} more popular due to ease of fabrication. This paper presents a three dimension Finite Element Model (FEM), using the multi-purpose software ABAQUS, to study the effect of different geometrical parameters on the ultimate behavior of the connection. The proposed model takes into account material and geometrical non-linearities, initial imperfection, contact between adjacent surfaces and the pretension force in the bolts. The Finite Element results are calibrated with published experimental results ''briefly reviewed in this paper'' and verified that the numerical model can simulate and analyze the overall and detailed behavior {{of different types of}} bolted end-plate steel connections. Using verified FEM, parametric study is then carried out to study the ultimate behavior with variations in: bolt diameter, end-plate thickness, length of column <b>stiffener,</b> <b>angle</b> of rib stiffener. The results are examined with respect to the failure modes, the evolution of the resistance, the initial stiffness, and the rotation capacity. Finally, the ultimate behavior of the bolted end-plate steel connection is discussed in detail, and recommendations for the design purpose are made...|$|E
40|$|A unified {{analytical}} approach {{is applied to}} investigate the vibrational behavior of grid-stiffened cylindrical shells with different boundary conditions. A smeared method is employed to superimpose the stiffness contribution of the stiffeners with those of shell {{in order to obtain}} the equivalent stiffness parameters of the whole panel. Theoretical formulation is established based on Sanders’ thin shell theory. The modal forms are assumed to have the axial dependency in the form of Fourier series whose derivatives are legitimized using Stoke's transformation. A 3 D finite element model is also built using ABAQUS software which takes into consideration the exact geometric configuration of the stiffeners and the shell. The achievements from the two types of analyses are compared with each other and good agreement has been obtained. The Influences of variations in shell geometrical parameters, boundary condition, and changes in the cross <b>stiffeners</b> <b>angle</b> on the natural frequencies are studied. The results obtained are novel and {{can be used as a}} benchmark for further studies. The simplicity and the capability of the present method are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Grid-stiffened {{composite}} structures, {{where the}} skin is stiffened by a lattice of stiffeners, not only allow for significant reduction in structural weight but are also competitive in terms of structural stability and damage tolerance compared with sandwich composite structures. As the development of Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) technology matures, integrated construction of skin and stiffeners is easily manufacturable. Optimization of grid-stiffened structures is needed to fully {{take advantage of the}} expanded design possibilities. In this paper, a steering/curved stiffener layout is optimized for grid-stiffened composite structures in order to enhance the structural buckling resistance. A homogenization method is used to calculate the equivalent material properties. Global and local buckling loads are determined by a global/local coupled strategy. A linear variation of <b>stiffener</b> <b>angles</b> is assumed resulting in the formation of a locally rhombic lattice pattern by the stiffeners. Moreover, manufacturing constraints are considered in the optimization by setting a lower bound on the stiffener spacing. Since the calculation is implemented on an equivalent model with a fixed mesh, it is possible to use a gradient-based optimization algorithm. A comparison between the performance of grid-stiffened composite structures with curved stiffeners, with straight stiffeners, and with variable-stiffness skins with curved fibers, reveals the potential of curved stiffener configurations in improving structural efficiency.

In this paper, the {{development}} of reliable 3 D FE models of stiffened angle connections is dealt with. These advanced models will permit to obtain {{the assessment of the}} 3 D deformational response of some future tests. Abaqus® finite element code was used to carry the 3 D finite element analyses out. Symmetry was considered for these numerical analyses so a quarter of the geometry was modelled. The results obtained are compared with those from the analysis of the analogous specimens but without the top <b>angle</b> <b>stiffener,</b> showing an important increase in the initial connection stiffness.

Hereby, a surface-based anisotropic model is incorporated, featuring <b>stiffeners</b> making an <b>angle</b> {{to the surface}} plane {{as well as an}} angle to the plane which is wall-normal and in flow direction. Results are shown for Blasius flow using compliant-wall parameters found in literature, demonstrating the effect of the yawing angle on linear stability. It is concluded that the propagation direction of the most amplified instabilities can be altered. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{initiate}} an alternative design for tankers. The target of this investigation is to create a new structural arrangement for the double hull region of the tanker, using corrugated plates after replacing all the secondary support members such as longitudinals, floors, intercostal girders, brackets, stringers, <b>stiffeners,</b> frames, <b>angle</b> clips, bounding bars etc. This work has been mainly influenced to generate a shape with easy accessibility, well visibility and less complication to fabrication, since this portion of vessel is really congested for inspection and maintenance. However, this study is predominantly focused on the calculations of thicknesses and section modulii of the proposed corrugated plates and comparison with the required section modulii for a model vessel in the same region according to the classification rules. All the calculations have been carried out according to the “Common Structural Rules For Double Hull Oi...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design methodology for a laminated composite stiffened panel, subjected to multiple in-plane loads and bending moments. Design variables include {{the skin and}} <b>stiffener</b> ply orientation <b>angles</b> and <b>stiffener</b> geometry variables. Optimum designs are sought which minimize structural weight and satisfy mechanical performance requirements. Two types of mechanical performance requirements are placed on the panel, maximum strain and minimum strength. Minimum weight designs are presented which document that the choice of mechanical performance requirements cause changes in the optimum design. The effects of lay-up constraints which limit the ply angles to user specified values, such as symmetric or quasi-isotropic laminates, are also investigated...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{effects of}} boundary conditions and axial loading on frequency characteristics of rotating laminated conical shells with meridional and circumferential stiffeners, i. e., stringers and rings, using Generalized Differential Quadrature Method (GDQM). Hamilton's principle is applied when the stiffeners {{are treated as}} discrete elements. The conical shells are stiffened at uniform intervals and {{it is assumed that}} the stiffeners have similar material and geometric properties. Equations of motion as well as equations of the boundary condition are transformed into a set of algebraic equations by applying the GDQM. Obtained results discuss the effects of parameters such as rotating velocities, depth to width ratios of the stiffeners, number of <b>stiffeners,</b> cone <b>angles,</b> and boundary conditions on natural frequency of the shell. The results will then be compared with those of other published works particularly with a non-stiffened conical shell and a special case where angle of the stiffened conical shell approaches zero, i. e. a stiffened cylindrical shell. In addition, another comparison is made with present FE method for a non-rotating stiffened conical shell. These comparisons confirm reliability of the present work as a measure to approximate solutions to the problem of rotating stiffened conical shells...|$|R

In order to prevent the structural buckling, the vee stiffeners is employed and placed on the compressive region. A higher peak pressure was applied in order to investigate the buckling phenomena on the corrugated panel with vee <b>stiffener.</b> The inclined <b>angle</b> of vee <b>stiffener</b> was varied from 15 ° to 90 °.

40|$|This {{program was}} {{initiated}} to replace labor-intensive ply-by-ply layup of composite I-beam posts and <b>angle</b> <b>stiffeners</b> {{used in the}} Space Station Freedom (SSF) rack structure. Hot drape forming (HDF) has been successfully implemented by BCAG for 777 composite I-stringers and by Bell Helicopter/Textron for the V- 22 I-stingers. The two companies utilize two vastly different approaches to the I-beam fabrication process. A drape down process is used by Bell Helicopter where the compacted ply charge is placed {{on top of a}} forming mandrel and heated. When the heated ply charge reached a set temperature, vacuum pressure is applied and the plies are formed over the mandrel. The BCAG 777 process utilizes an inverted forming process where the ply stack is placed on a forming table and the mandrel is inverted and placed upon the ply stack. A heating and vacuum bladder underneath the ply stack form the play stack up onto the mandrels after reaching the temperature setpoint. Both methods have their advantages, but the drape down process was selected for SSF because it was more versatile and could be fabricated from readily available components...|$|R
40|$|Active {{control of}} {{vibration}} in structures {{has been investigated}} by {{an increasing number of}} researchers in recent years. There has {{been a great deal of}} theoretical work and some experiment examining the use of point forces for vibration control, and more recently, the use of thin piezoelectric crystals laminated to the surfaces of structures. However, control by point forces is impractical, requiring large reaction masses, and the forces generated by laminated piezoelectric crystals are not sufficient to control vibration in large and heavy structures. The control of flexural vibrations in stiffened structures using piezoceramic stack actuators placed between stiffener flanges and the structure is examined theoretically and experimentally in this thesis. Used in this way, piezoceramic actuators are capable of developing much higher forces than laminated piezoelectric crystals, and no reaction mass is required. This thesis aims to show the feasibility of active vibration control using piezoceramic actuators and <b>angle</b> <b>stiffeners</b> in a variety of fundamental structures. The work is divided into three parts. In the first, the simple case of a single actuator used to control vibration in a beam is examined. In the second, vibration in stiffened plates is controlled using multiple actuators, and in the third, the control of vibration in a ring-stiffened cylinder is investigated. In each section, the classical equations of motion are used to develop theoretical models describing the vibration of the structures with and without active vibration control. The effects of the <b>angle</b> <b>stiffener(s)</b> are included in the analysis. The models are used to establish the quantitative effects of variation in frequency, the location of control source(s) and the location of the error sensor(s) on the achievable attenuation and the control forces required for optimal control. Comparison is also made between the results for the cases with multiple control sources driven by the same signal and with multiple independently driven control sources. Both finite and semi-finite structures are examined to enable comparison between the results for travelling waves and standing waves in each of the three structure types. This thesis attempts to provide physical explanations for all the observed variations in achievable attenuation and control force(s) with varied frequency, control source location and error sensor location. The analysis of the simpler cases aids in interpreting the results for the more complicated cases. Experimental results are given to demonstrate the accuracy of the theoretical models in each section. Trials are performed on a stiffened beam with a single control source and a single error sensor, a stiffened plate with three control sources and a line of error sensors and a ring-stiffened cylinder with six control sources and a ring of error sensors. The experimental results are compared with theory for each structure for the two cases with and without active vibration control. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Ultrasonic guided waves {{inspection}} using Lamb waves {{is suitable}} for damage detection in metallic structures. This paper will present experimental results obtained using guided Lamb waves to detect flaws in aluminum specimens with design features applicable to space applications. Two aluminum panels were fabricated from a variable-thickness aluminum top plate, with two bolted I-beams edge stiffeners and four bonded <b>angle</b> <b>stiffeners.</b> Artificial damages were introduced in the two panels: cracks, corrosions, and disbonds. The proposed investigation methods used bonded piezoelectric wafer active sensors to excite and receive Lamb waves. Three wave propagation methods were used: pitch–catch, pulse–echo, and the embedded ultrasonic structural radar. In addition, we also used a standing-wave damage detection technique, the electromechanical impedance method. The paper will present in detail the salient results from using these methods for damage detection and structural health monitoring. Where appropriate, comparison between different methods in detecting the same damage will be performed. The results have demonstrated the ability of piezoelectric wafer active sensors working in conjunction with guided Lamb waves to detect various types of damages present in complex geometry structures typical of space applications.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} robust methods of FEA to evaluate non-linear lower bound limit load estimates of ship type structures. The robust methods used in this thesis include the r-node method, Progressive Modulus Reduction (PMR) method, and the mα method. The results of each technique are compared {{to the results of}} full nonlinear finite element analysis, analytical solutions and lab test data where available. The structures modelled in this thesis included a rectangular indeterminate beam, three types of mainframe <b>stiffeners</b> (flat bar, <b>angle</b> and tee), a flat bar stiffened panel and an Arctic icebreaker grillage. [...] Robust methods make use of a modulus reduction scheme to redistribute and relax peak stresses in the structure. By iterating and selectively correcting the local modulus in finite element models, the form of a limit state stress distribution can be evaluated. In order for the limit loads evaluated based on this limit state stress distribution to be lower bound, the conditions of the stress field in the structure must be "statically admissible. ” [...] The basis of the r-node method is the identification of redistribution nodes or r-nodes within a structure, which are essentially load-controlled locations. Identification of exact r-node locations may be difficult to achieve with finite mesh densities particularly in complex structures. As well, complicated structures pose added difficulties in achieving a progressive r-node stress relaxation with increased iterations. This may be partly attributed to the difficulty in locating exact r-node locations. [...] The mα method was developed in an attempt to improve lower bound estimates of limit loads, making use of just two linear elastic analyses. The notion of a "reference volume is used in conjunction with the "theorem of nesting surfaces" and the concept of leapfrogging to a near limit state to evaluate lower and upper bounds on the limit load. The results of this thesis indicate that for complicated structures~ improved limit load estimates can be obtained if four or more iterations of moduli are carried out. Reducing the rate of relaxation (reducing modulus adjustment index q) may enhance convergence characteristics, but results in a higher state of limit stress evaluated. [...] The Progressive Modulus Reduction (PMR) method, which is an extension of the elastic compensation method, systematically adjusts or reduces the moduli of the pseudo-elastic stressed elements of a structure to synthesise the growth of the yield zone. The PMR method is used to evaluate the non-linear deflection of the structure for applied loads up to the limit load. [...] In general the robust methods are an attractive alternative for evaluating limit loads of ship type structures. Results are a significant improvement over classical methods and are either close for simple structures or sufficiently conservative when compared to full non-linear FEA results. Each robust method models material non-linearities and hence evaluates good estimates of a non-linear limit load. Also, because the solution process is stable, convergence difficulties, encountered with full non-linear analysis, are avoided. Limit loads can be evaluated in a cost effective manner, which is particularly attractive at the initial stages of design...|$|R
