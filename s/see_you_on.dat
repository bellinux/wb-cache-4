500|$|After {{the release}} of the album, the {{youngest}} of the brothers, Joe Loeffler, was dismissed from Chevelle. Due to different stories from the band members, it is unclear whether he was fired or left the band of his own accord. Pete and Sam stated the following on the band's official website: [...] "After three years of non-stop touring and recording, Joe is taking a break to be home with family. We'll miss having him on the road with us, but as his brothers and bandmates we respect his decision and are looking forward to getting out there and playing for the fans. <b>See</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> tour." [...] However, according to Ultimate Guitar Archive, Joe said he was fired.|$|E
500|$|While {{promoting}} <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>on</b> the Other Side in Europe, Jonathan Davis {{was diagnosed}} with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, a blood platelet disorder that hospitalized him for the weekend and prevented him from performing at the renowned Download Festival. Despite the illness, the band still performed, with guest singers including Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Stone Sour fame, Trivium's Matt Heafy, Skindred's Benji Webbe and Avenged Sevenfold's M. Shadows. This led to Korn canceling {{the rest of their}} European bill for 2006, including the Hellfest Summer Open Air. It was originally unknown to the public what his ailment was, but the singer revealed in a letter to fans that he was [...] "dangerously low on blood platelets and at a high risk of death from a hemorrhage if the problem was not treated".|$|E

I had not <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> steal away through the bracken. Oh, it was terrible! You {{looked like a}} murderer! I shall never, never forget it." ...|$|R
2500|$|The band Trailer Choir's song [...] "What Would You Say" [...] is a {{song about}} the Sago Mine Disaster. The {{following}} words appear in the song: [...] "13 men felt trapped in a mine in West Virginia,/only one made it out alive/but their love lives on in the words/I can not wait to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> the other side." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 28, 1954, Benny co-hosted [...] with Groucho Marx and Mary Martin. In September 1954, CBS premiered Chrysler's Shower of Stars co-hosted by Jack Benny and William Lundigan. It {{enjoyed a}} {{successful}} run from 1954 until 1958. Both television shows often overlapped {{the radio show}}. In fact, the radio show alluded frequently to its television counterparts. Often as not, Benny would sign off the radio show in such circumstances with the line [...] "Well, good night, folks. I'll <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> television." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soulfly {{moved away}} from the nu metal style and moved to styles such as death metal and thrash metal. Kittie {{abandoned}} the [...] style and started making music with elements of genres such as black metal and death metal. Korn and Mudvayne maintained their popularity during the mid-2000s, although they did not completely abandon the nu metal style. [...] Korn combined their earlier sound with influences from other genres, such as industrial. Korn's songs [...] "Coming Undone" [...] and [...] "Twisted Transistor", which both are on their 2005 album <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>on</b> the Other Side, reached the Billboard Hot 100; Pop music producers The Matrix helped produce the album. Mudvayne's 2005 album Lost and Found was seen as gravitating towards a more accessible sound. The album's song [...] "Happy?" [...] peaked at number 89 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number 91 on Billboard Pop 100 chart. In 2005, Limp Bizkit released a record called The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) without promoting and advertising the record. The album was not very popular; its sales fell 67% during its second week of release. In 2006, Limp Bizkit went on hiatus.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sir Guy himself!' {{said the}} coachman, turning round, and {{touching}} his hat, anxious {{to do the}} honours of his coach. 'I have not <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> this road before, sir, for I never forget a face; I hope you'll often be this way.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing--nothing," [...] {{answered}} the appalled bonnet maker. [...] "Only I {{thought you might}} like to know that he questioned me close if I had <b>seen</b> <b>thee</b> <b>on</b> St. Valentine's Day, after the uproar at the Dominicans', and in what company thou wert." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I declare!" [...] She {{addressed}} Razumov directly. [...] "The {{people who}} have <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> your way here are right. You are very reserved.

The 8th Infantry Regiment was ordered to make the initial D-Day landing on Utah Beach as part of the invasion. [...] As they sailed to France from England on the night of June5 aboard the navy's USS Barnett on the rough English channel, they heard Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower's exhortation to the troops over the radio, [...] "Together, we shall achieve victory". Afterwards, the company commanders were summoned by the 2nd Battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Carlton MacNeely, to Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.'s {{quarters}} for a final briefing before the invasion. When the meeting ended near midnight, Schroeder later recounted, the officers [...] "wished each other well and shook hands", and MacNeely put his arm around Schroeder's shoulders. Addressing the young captain by his nickname, [...] "Moose", MacNeely said, [...] "Well, Moose, this is it. Give 'em hell!" [...] Schroeder said they both [...] "choked up" [...] and he replied, [...] "Well, colonel, I'll <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> the beach!" [...] Roosevelt said, [...] "Moose, take me in your boat when you go ashore". At 2:30a.m. on June 6, Schroeder's company left the Barnett to board their LCVP landing craft. Before departing the Barnett to face the enemy, Schroeder wrote a letter to his wife: [...] "I told her where I was, what I was about to do, and how much I loved her".|$|E

You're the school-master from Walford, I think, sir? Indeed, I'm sure of it, for I've <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> your wheel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-morning, lieutenant," [...] Captain O'Connor said. [...] "I {{think we}} have got them fairly trapped; but doubtless they would have made off if they hadn't <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> the watch outside. It's that notorious scoundrel the Red Captain of Galway who is, I hear, hiding here with his gang." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Crewe lit a cigar, {{but he did}} {{not offer}} one to Austen, as he had to Mr. Tooting.

6000|$|... 'You mistake my purpose, I see, ma'am,' replied Mr Nickleby, in {{his usual}} blunt fashion. 'I have no money to throw away on miniatures, ma'am, and nobody to give one to (thank God) if I had. <b>Seeing</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> the stairs, I wanted to ask a {{question}} of you, about some lodgers here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dost thou hear that, John?" [...] exclaimed Richard. [...] "Ladders, man--get ladders, {{and to the}} wall.

6000|$|... "Then you are Mr. Lindsay!" [...] the Resident exclaimed, {{dropping}} his pen and rising to his feet. [...] "I received a despatch, yesterday, {{saying that you}} were coming.

6000|$|... "Hum! {{not exactly}} such an unfortunate devil; but {{a sort of}} {{conventional}} non-combatant. I shared the hardships, the glory, the equivocal victories (where we killed and drove countless numbers of rebels--who were not), and, woe is me! the capitulation of Burgoyne. But let that pass-which {{was more than the}} Yankees would allow us to do.

No, no; I have never <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> before this night in a drawing-room!" ...|$|R
