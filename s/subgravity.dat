40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>subgravity</b> (much less than unit gravity) on fertilization, cell division, differentiation, {{and growth of}} a {{relatively}} simple biological system (eggs of the sea urchin Arbacia punctulata) were considered. The experiment was flown on Gemini 3 and recovered as scheduled. However, the experiment objectives were not achieved, primarily for mechanical reasons...|$|E
40|$|Oxygen cost (VO 2) {{and heart}} rate (HR) were {{determined}} during treadmill walking in simulated <b>subgravity</b> environments. The long axis of the subject's body was suspended {{parallel to the floor}} in a slow rotation room with feet aligned on the surface of a treadmill mounted 90 deg on the wall. Without rotation, the subjects were virtually weightless against the treadmill; with centrifugation, environments of 0. 25, 0. 5 and 1 G were simulated. Oxygen cost (open circuit) and HR (ECG) were measured during the 5 th minute of walking at 3. 2, 4. 7 and 6. 1 km/h. Similar measurements were also determined during walking at 1 / 2 -G using the inclined plane technique. Oxygen cost per unit mass and HR were significantly reduced in all <b>subgravity</b> environments. However, net oxygen cost per unit weight carried and, therefore, mechanical efficiency was found to be independent of gravity. This supports the idea that the most probable cause for the decreased oxygen cost with reduced gravity is less body weight carried...|$|E
40|$|Significance of {{gravitation}} {{forces in}} regulating homeostasis is discussed, along with weightlessness effects on humans {{and a state}} of reduced weight (<b>subgravity),</b> such as on the moon. Biomedical effects of weightlessness adaptation to zero G and readaptation to terrestrial gravitation are described for the nervous system, cardiovascular system, metabolism, and musculoskeletal system. Reactions caused primarly by: (1) changes in the afferent nervous system, (2) lack of hydrostatic blood pressure, (3) lack of weight on the musculoskeletal system, and (4) exposure limits derived {{from the effects of}} prolonged weightlessness on humans are reviewed. Protection of humans from adverse effects of weightlessness is considered; Skylab missions are also summarized...|$|E
40|$|Simulated <b>subgravity</b> conditions, such as {{bed rest}} and water immersion, cause a {{decrease}} in a acceleration tolerance (3, 4), tilt tolerance (3, 9, 10), work capacity (5, 7), and plasma volume (1, 8 - 10). Moderate exercise training performed during bed rest (4) and prior to water immersion (5) provides some protection against the adverse effects of deconditioning, but the relationship between exercise and changes due to deconditioning remains unclear. Heat acclimation increases plasma and interstitial volumes, total body water, stroke volume (11), and tilt tolerance (6) and may, therefore, be a more efficient method of ameliorating deconditioning than physical training alone. The present study was undertaken {{to determine the effects}} of heat acclimation and moderate physical training, performed in cool conditions, on water-immersion deconditioning...|$|E
40|$|Studies of disordered motor-sensory {{feedback}} ra {{questions about}} man's coordination in outer spa Can man function effectively, let alone survive, in the exotic environments {{to which the}} astronaut will be exposed? The answers promise to be of scientific interest as well as practical consequence. Optimistic forecasts have been made of man's ability to perform efficiently in outer space for indefinitely long periods. These predictions have generally been based upon observations of human adaptability to the many and diverse circumstances found above, below, and {{on the surface of}} the earth. Some of the conditions to be encountered in space have been simulated by existing equipment on earth, and their consequences for human performance have been tested. Other conditions cannot be so directly tested, and informed speculation becomes necessary. For example, the effects of gravity have been reduced to zero for periods of less than 1 minute in aircraft flying Keplerian trajectories; <b>subgravity</b> states of longer duration have been achieved only in space vehicles. But even in the space flights of long duration astronauts have not yet experienced prolonged periods of free movement at zero gravity. For this condition, we make a less optimistic forecast, based upon recent analyses of sensorimotor function.
