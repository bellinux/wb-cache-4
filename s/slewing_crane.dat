40|$|In the paper, {{a method}} of final {{positioning}} of a load in slewing motion for jib cranes is proposed. The method {{is based on the}} so called ”map of basic functions”.

Drive functions for different parameters, particularly for different slew angles, are calculated by a crane control system directly before slewing. Linear interpolation is used for this task.

50|$|Stationary {{harbour cranes}} are {{considered}} a new development of the Middle Ages; its earliest use being documented for Utrecht in 1244. The typical harbour crane was a pivoting structure equipped with double treadwheels. There were two types: wooden gantry cranes pivoting on a central vertical axle and stone tower cranes which housed the windlass and treadwheels with only the jib arm and roof rotating. These cranes were placed on docksides for the loading and unloading of cargo where they replaced or complemented older lifting methods like see-saws, winches and yards. <b>Slewing</b> <b>cranes</b> which allowed a rotation of the load and were thus particularly suited for dockside work appeared as early as 1340.|$|R

40|$|When {{designing}} a crane 2 ̆ 7 s load-carrying structures, a static analysis is still central to a preliminary {{determination of the}} dimensions required. However, tobring {{the results of these}} calculations closer to reality, different quasi-static procedures are introduced. These procedures take account of various dynamic effects by means of appropriate coefficients. In this paper, anew procedure is proposed for determining the maximum horizontal inertial forces in a radial direction that are acting on a load suspended from the jib during a crane 2 ̆ 7 s slewing motion. Based on a previously developed and verified mathematical model of a general-type <b>slewing</b> <b>crane,</b> we undertook the following. Firstly, we verified that the horizontal inertial forces in the radial direction are of no less importance (no smaller in terms of their magnitude) than the forces in the tangential direction, and that their maximumvalues can easily be a few times greater than the nominal centrifugal force. Based on this we introduced a new coefficient of radial horizontal inertial force, and we calculated a diagram for the rapid determination of this coefficient. We also present a brief report of the horizontal inertial forces in the tangential direction...|$|E
40|$|For {{offshore}} installation projects Jumbo uses her J-class {{heavy lift crane}} vessels. The objects {{that need to be}} installed offshore are carried at deck or in the ship's hull. At location the object is lifted by the on-board heavy lift crane and slewed {{to the side of the}} ship. From the final overboard position the object can be lowered to the seabed. When the load is displaces by the <b>slewing</b> <b>crane,</b> the equilibrium of moments is disrupted and the ship will roll or heel. To reduce this moment change the ship pumps ballast water from one side to the other and causes a counter moment. This simple system has limited capacities and it was assumed that an improvement could reduce the duration of the lifting phase. This thesis is about a research to decrease the duration of the lifting phase for the Jumbo J-class, focussing on anti-heeling. To understand the context of the problem, research has been done on the company and the market she is operating in. Then the phenomenon of anti-heeling, the current ballast system and the operational limits were analysed. With the information obtained from this research a list of requirements and the load cases were selected. The analysis showed that the current system capacity is based on three manual controlled centrifugal pumps that can either been switch on or off. This system cannot easily vary the moment change and was believed to be limiting for lift operations. To find a new solution design methods are used to generate a variety of concepts. For five concept calculation has been done to predict their capacity and dimensions. The analysis showed that a new solution is unlikely to be financially attractive for the market Jumbo is operating in. Therefore the decision has been made to research the effects of the most economical potential solution. Variably frequency drives were applied to the pump system to see if the variations of the rotational speed of the pumps and therefore varying the flow rate would make easier to control the roll motions. Or even shorten the lift phase. To examine the ballast system and the sensitivities a model has been made. As this research focused on roll and heeling motions only, a 2 D model is used to predict heave, sway and roll motions. The model is based on the equilibrium of moments where the ship is exposed to wave induced moments and the moments caused by the crane and ballast system. The crane and ballast system are effected by the ship motions and therefore coupled to these motions. The model allows to automate the control of the crane motions and the pump rotations. This allowed the model to test different lift scenarios under different wave conditions. The results showed that the variable frequency drivers can result in smaller differences of the heeling angles. But the results also showed that the ballast system was not the most important limiting factor. It was the moment change caused by the crane. When the crane tip with hanging load was displaced with a certain speed, it caused an impulse making the ship oscillate around the static heeling angle. The amplitudes of these oscillations and the static heeling angle could be reduced by the ballast system. But the best results were shown when the stability properties of the vessel were improved. Increasing the effective metacentric height from 2. 25 to 3. 25 showed significantly reduce roll excitations. Other conclusions are that previously very conservative roll angles of 1 o were used, while the mast crane proved to handle roll angles of 4 o and larger depending on the load. Also the lay out of the current pump system leaves a lot of room of improvement. These improvements can be found in the recommendations as well as suggestions how to discover potential time savings during offshore operations.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to modern cranes, medieval cranes and hoists - much like {{their counterparts in}} Greece and Rome - were primarily capable of a vertical lift, and not used to move loads for a considerable distance horizontally as well. Accordingly, lifting work was organized at the workplace {{in a different way}} than today. In building construction, for example, it is assumed that the crane lifted the stone blocks either from the bottom directly into place, or from a place opposite the centre of the wall from where it could deliver the blocks for two teams working {{at each end of the}} wall. Additionally, the crane master who usually gave orders at the treadwheel workers from outside the crane was able to manipulate the movement laterally by a small rope attached to the load. <b>Slewing</b> <b>cranes</b> which allowed a rotation of the load and were thus particularly suited for dockside work appeared as early as 1340.

40|$|Abstract: Design of state-of-the art crane {{mechanisms}} {{involves a}} multi-stage and multi-criterial optimization. Depending on the specificity and intended {{use of the}} machine, the optimal structure and dimensions of its mechanisms are sought as well as optimal algorithms for drive control and regulation, which requires the application of optimization criteria. It appears, however, that the approach relying on the minimum of a specifically formulated quadratic functional enables the selection of optimal geometric parameters of the mechanism and, besides, proves effective as the method of drive control. Furthermore, the geometric parameters of the mechanism can be optimized for its entire working range.

40|$|Cables are an {{integral}} part of many engineering systems; thus, the control of cables and systems containing cables is an important problem to address. This thesis proposes to use command shaping techniques to reduce command-induced vibration in two cabled systems, a tower crane and an electrodynamic tethered satellite system in low Earth orbit. Systems containing cables often exhibit important nonlinear dynamics, which complicates the application of command shaping. 	As a first step to demonstrate the effectiveness of command shaping techniques for nonlinear cabled systems, nonlinear tower crane dynamics are investigated. A novel command generation technique for the <b>slewing</b> of tower <b>cranes</b> is presented, and experimental results demonstrate its increased effectiveness. Once improvement of tower crane dynamics has been demonstrated, space tether dynamics are considered. 	Electrodynamic tethers have the promise to become invaluable propulsive actuators for orbit boost and station keeping. Using electrodynamic tethers, it is possible to boost orbits without the use of propellant because electrical energy is used to produce a Lorentz force that creates orbit boost. Furthermore, electrodynamic tether deboost makes it possible to accelerate the deorbiting of spent rocket stages and other space debris to reduce clutter in the space environment. Unfortunately, the Lorentz force pushes transversely on the cable tether, thereby producing a significant amount of vibration and libration. 	This thesis proposes to use command shaping techniques to reduce the command-induced vibration from a boosting operation. Intelligent command generation will significantly reduce the amount of tether libration and string vibration. First, flexible tether dynamics in a constant, circular orbit are investigated. The work is then expanded to include the effects of orbit boosting. The robustness of the command generation techniques is established through numerical simulation. M. S.
