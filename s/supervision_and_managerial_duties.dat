40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to gather {{insights}} on the underlying social factors behind {{the current state of}} controller roles in a multinational enterprise. Additionally, the thesis explores the possibility of managing perceptions and expectations of controller roles, in accordance to corporate business objectives. In order to do this, theoretical concepts of Role Theory, Boundary Spanning and Identity Control were utilized. This paper has a qualitative research design and is based on an embedded single-case study. Due to the exploratory nature of the research, the study is based on the method of „systematic combining‟. The objectives of the company were to establish both local and regional controllers as business partners. Findings indicate that the regional controller could focus on business advisory tasks to a large extent due to a formally appointed role, whereas the local controllers were restricted by their role and expectations to focus more on scorekeeping <b>and</b> <b>managerial</b> <b>duties.</b> The term „business partner‟ was spread throughout the organization. By ascribing this label to controllers, other expectations on the role were induced, which also infers a higher hierarchical positioning.

Substantial earnings gaps are found and strong evidence of a glass ceiling for women is established. After allowing for positive self-selection into full-time employment by British women, we find that a significant and substantial gender earnings gap remains. The majority of this gap is related to men receiving larger payments for their observed characteristics (especially higher education, being a manager, <b>and</b> having <b>managerial</b> <b>duties)</b> than women receive. Gender differences in these relative payments are found to increase over the earnings distribution, especially above the 80 th quantile and are strongly associated with a glass ceiling for women working full-time in Britain...|$|R

40|$|Public Administration has reluctantly been {{accepted}} as a science by some of its sister disciplines in the Social Sciences. This may be ascribed to the eclectic nature of the Discipline and its reliance on related disciplines to explain, direct and inform study and practice. Public Administration studies human beings engaged in administrative <b>and</b> <b>managerial</b> <b>duties</b> in organs of state. Therefore, any study should consider the behaviour and actions of human beings in an organisational setting operating in a political environment. Sciences depend on theory to investigate, explain and predict the phenomena being studied. A science has to be founded on justifiable laws or acceptable theories to develop new knowledge and influence practice. Public Administration is in the unenviable position that it studies social phenomena subjected to continuous change due to societal values and political changes. Thus {{it has to be}} able to adopt theories providing for universal truths, but accommodating the new domain of study, e. g. the development of public-private-partnerships and the evolution of the developmental state. Various theories related to Public Administration will be investigated in this article to establish their relevance. This will be used as a foundation to enter into a discourse regarding the identification of the requirements against which Public Administration theory should be tested. With this as a point of departure the possible development of Public Administration related theories will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to assess the influence of ownership structure on earnings quality in China from 2007 to 2014. As an expansion of previous researches, this paper combines two research perspectives from Wang and Yung (2011) and Firth et al. (2007) and in addition, the direction of earning management is tested for detecting managerial behavior. During the analysis, I divide all Chinese listed firms into two groups at first, State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) and non-SOEs. I find that even the related party transactions are considered, SOEs are still have higher earnings quality than its counterparts, and the divergence between those two groups are growing. Then, in order to discuss into more details about the impact of different types of SOEs, SOEs are classified by their nature, which are SOEs affiliated to central government (SOECG) and other SOEs, referred as non-SOECG. The results follow the general awareness that SOECGs would have less earnings management due to facing more strict <b>supervision</b> <b>and</b> less <b>managerial</b> compensation incentives...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} extent to which managerial overconfidence affects corporate decisions. This analysis includes three essays, which address a wide range of corporate decisions including financing, investment, acquisition, innovation, liquidity management and advertising decisions. The first essay introduces a fine-tuned test of the relationship between <b>managerial</b> overconfidence <b>and</b> corporate decisions by taking the chief financial officer (CFO) overconfidence effect into account. Ex-ante, I identify financial policies and non-financial policies such as investment, innovation and acquisition as the primary <b>managerial</b> <b>duties</b> of CFOs <b>and</b> chief executive officers (CEOs) respectively. I construct overconfidence measures for both CEOs and CFOs and test the impact of CEO and CFO overconfidence, both on financial decisions and on nonfinancial decisions. Based on a sample of 1, 173 S&P 1500 firms, I find that financial policies are primarily affected by CFO overconfidence while only CEO overconfidence affects nonfinancial decisions. My findings demonstrate that managerial biases affect corporate decisions <b>and</b> <b>managerial</b> <b>duties</b> shape the ways in which top managers influence corporate policies. The second essay investigates how overconfident CEOs allocate resources toward innovation activities. It argues that overconfident CEOs tend to have greater innovation input. To finance innovation, they save more cash out of the cash flow and spend more on innovation when the cash flow is high. Results from an empirical analysis of 1, 015 S&P 1500 firms support this argument. Moreover, based on a series of financial constraint measurements, the effect of CEO overconfidence on liquidity management is found to be more pronounced in financially constrained firms and in highly innovative firms, but not in firms without financial constraints. With regards to innovation performance, overconfident CEOs tend to have more patents, but the overall quality of their patents is not significantly better than that of rational CEOs. The third essay introduces a simple model of firm advertising behavior in monopolistic competition industries and applies it to the situation of managerial overconfidence. The model shows that the optimal advertising to sales ratio is determined by both firm advertising competency and consumer preference. Overconfident CEOs are more willing to use advertising as a means to convey the quality of their firms and products. Such overestimation of the effects of advertising by overconfident CEOs will result in overspending on advertising. When financially constrained, an overconfident CEO's tendency to overspend will be curbed to some extent, but his amount of advertising will increase with cash flows. An empirical analysis of 654 S&P 1500 firms supports these predictions. The distorted effect of managerial overconfidence is more prominent when firms are financially constrained and when the overconfidence measure is continuous...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates gender {{differences}} across the log wage distributions of British employees working full-time in 2005. The raw gender wage gap shows {{a tendency to}} increase across the distribution with a glass ceiling effect indicated. A strong relationship between high skilled, white-collar occupations <b>and</b> carrying out <b>managerial</b> <b>duties</b> with the glass ceiling effect is indicated in the data. After allowing for positive selection into full-time employment by British women, a substantially larger gender earning gaps is found: the selection corrected gender wage gap is close to twice the raw gap across most of the earnings distribution. This selection corrected gap {{is found to be}} predominantly related to women receiving lower rewards for their characteristics than men. Indeed, the results suggest the gender earnings gap would all but disappear across the earnings distribution if women working full-time received the same returns to their characteristics as men working full-time in Britain do...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the focus}} of pharmacists as {{traditional}} drug dispensers has shifted to more active and participative role in risk assessment, risk management, and other medication related consultation activities. Pharmacy profession is evolving steadily in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Pharmacists in UAE are so much occupied in their administrative <b>and</b> <b>managerial</b> <b>duties</b> that dispensing is mostly attended to by pharmacy technicians. Pharmacist-led patient counseling {{is limited to the}} dosage and frequency of medications and rarely adverse reactions and drug interactions with other medications. Therefore we decided to perform quantitative questionnaires study to explore the role of pharmacist in patient counseling in UAE, the evaluation of pharmacist′s opinion on patient counseling and the potential determinants of personal consultation. Results show the frequency and nature of inquiries received by pharmacist. Five to twenty inquires per month are received from patient, most of them related to drug prescription and dose recommendation. Thirty nine percent of pharmacists received inquiries from doctors, most of them related to the dose and mode of action. Ninty two percent of the pharmacists agreed that patient counseling is their professional responsibility. About 82 % of pharmacists agreed that counseling will increase their sales and enhance the reputation of their pharmacies. Seventy percent of pharmacists mentioned that they need to undergo training for effective counseling while 46 % of pharmacists felt that more staff in the pharmacies would have a positive influence on patient compliance to medication therapies and patient safety. The potential determinants of personal consultation show that 52 % of participants trusted pharmacist and 55 % considered the pharmacist as a friend. Forty eight percent of participants visited the pharmacy for medical recommendation while 30 % for drug compounding, 72 % agreed that pharmacist conducts full instruction while 31 % agreed about full investigation. In conclusion, reorganization of the pharmacist′s activities may improve pharmaceutical consultations. Pharmacists must be exposed to recent trends in drug therapy, dosage forms, dosage, adverse effects and interaction. This {{will go a long way}} in providing rational use of drugs to the patients and improve their quality of life...|$|R

40|$|Remuneration paid {{by public}} administrations in Belgium {{amounted}} to one-quarter of their primary expenditure in 2010. Because current conditions call for fiscal consolidation, {{it is important}} to examine whether this component of spending could be a source of budget savings, including by adjusting wages. The article focuses principally on wage gaps between the public sector and the private sector. The authors are especially interested in the situation in Belgium as compared with those of nine other euro area countries (Germany, Austria, Spain, France, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Slovenia), a study of which using microeconomic data was recently completed. In most of the countries analysed, wages are higher in the public sector than in the private sector, regardless of whether macroeconomic or microeconomic data are used. With the former, {{it is not possible to}} consider differences in the characteristics of the populations working in each of the two sectors. Indeed, the public sector – notably in Belgium – is more composed of women, older workers, and those with a higher level of education, but public sector employees work fewer hours and are less likely to occupy a managerial position. To take these factors – gender, seniority or age, education level, <b>and</b> <b>managerial</b> <b>duties</b> – into consideration when comparing wages between the two sectors, microeconomic data from the EU-SILC survey were used. The observations the authors were able to make based on the microeconomic and macroeconomic data overwhelmingly corroborate each other. The analysis shows that the countries where the average wage gap is the biggest in favour of the public sector are also the countries experiencing the toughest budget woes. In most of the countries studied, the salary advantage enjoyed by public sector workers holds for every sub-set of workers, although to differing extents. For example, wage gaps are the widest for women, for lower levels of income, for those who do not have supervisory functions, and in the branches of administration and education. The impact of education level on wage gaps varies from one country to the next. The wage gap between sectors in Belgium is one of the narrowest of any country studied, regardless of what data are used. According to macroeconomic data, it slightly favours the private sector. According to microeconomic data, in which wages are adjusted to control for individual characteristics, for many groups of workers the gaps are so limited that they are not statistically significant. public expenditure, wages...|$|R
