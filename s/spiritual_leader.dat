5|$|B'nai Israel was {{the only}} Jewish {{congregation}} in Memphis, and from {{the time it was}} established members were split between traditionalists and reformers. When remodeling their new building, the congregation voted eighteen to fourteen to maintain traditional separate seating for men and women.

Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.|$|E

5|$|In the Main Story, Nero is a {{young man}} who lives in the castle-town of Fortuna on a mysterious island, {{isolated}} {{from the rest of the}} world.

Their leader, is the High Priest Sanctus, who leads the congregation as a benevolent <b>spiritual</b> <b>leader,</b> despite Nero's clear lack of faith.
