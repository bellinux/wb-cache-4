2500|$|... (3) In machine {{engraving}} {{the pattern}} is impressed in the roller by a small cylindrical mill on which {{the pattern is}} in relief. It is an indirect process and requires the utmost care at every stage. The pattern or design is first altered in size to repeat evenly round the roller. One repeat of this pattern is then engraved by hand on a small highly polished soft steel roller, usually about 3 in. long and 1/2 in. to 3 in. in diameter; the size varies according {{to the size of}} the repeat with which it must be identical. It is then repolished, painted with a chalky mixture to prevent its surface oxidizing and exposed to a red-heat in a box filled with chalk and charcoal; then it is plunged in cold water to harden it and finally tempered to the proper degree of toughness. In this state it forms the die from which the mill is made. To produce the actual mill with the design in relief a softened <b>steel</b> <b>cylinder</b> is screwed tightly against the hardened die and the two are rotated under constantly increasing pressure until the softened cylinder or mill has received an exact replica in relief of the engraved pattern. The mill in turn is then hardened and tempered, when it is ready for use. In size it may be either exactly like the die or its circumferential measurement may be any multiple of that of the latter according to circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous early {{improvements}} {{were aimed}} at increasing reliability and life, including a switch from the [...] "U" [...] shaped top (exhaust) well to a [...] "V" [...] shaped top well. This eliminated the cast top deck, which had {{been the source of}} some early-life failures, in favor of a top deck fabricated from plate steel."Much field difficulty was experienced, particularly in the weld of the stress plate to the cast steel top deck. This difficulty can be blamed on two things. First, we were attempting to weld to cast steel which in some cases contained burned-in sand. This made welding inadequate due to slag inclusions, etc. Second, we were attempting to automatically weld against a back-up strip which in some cases did not fuse properly, leaving a bad notch effect which, of course, increased stress beyond working limits and fatigue failures resulted. There were approximately 600 of these crankcases made, twelve of which were 16s. Only four of these twelve were placed in railroad service. They were retired after about three years of service. A retirement program is now in effect for all of these cast top deck crankcases. A new crankcase was developed and went into production in early 1940 using a fabricated top deck, and can be most readily identified by a change in the exhaust well of the engine, which lies between the V's from U shape to a V shape. This design simplified top deck machining, eliminated the studding of the cast top deck by replacing the studs with through bolts retained by crabs {{at the bottom of the}} pots and crabs at the top of the cylinder heads, using self-aligning spherical washers and nuts (See Figure 49)." [...] The 567 gave way to the 567A in 1941, which incorporated further top deck improvements and camshaft gear train changes."By 1941 it was desirable to further simplify the crankcase, and the flat top deck Model 567 A crankcase was developed. This crankcase was first used on the 12 cylinder LST engines which started in production early in 1942. The crankcase incorporated a flat tie plate the full length of the engine which provided a flat surface for mounting exhaust manifolds and lift hooks (See Figure 50)."It was at this time that the gear train was simplified from four to two idler gears as explained previously. The cast <b>steel</b> <b>cylinder</b> head retainers were simplified over the second 567 design." [...] The 567B followed in 1946 with minor improvements."In 1946 a new line of crankcases, designated as the 567B, were introduced which were basically the same as the 567A except for a change to permit the mounting of the auxiliary generator drive gear. About three or four months after the introduction of the [...] "B" [...] engine the cylinder head retainer castings, which had been a continuous source of production problems, were replaced with steel forgings." [...] The 567C was released to further improve reliability and manufacturability. Visually, the 567C may be distinguished from earlier models by the presence of round (instead of square) handholes."We are in the final stages of developing a new crankcase to be known as the Model 567C which will further improve our product. One premise of this design has been to eliminate water on any stressed member of the crankcase because of corrosion difficulties. In the earlier crankcases just described, cracks have occurred in the area of the cooling water which were caused by corrosion fatigue (See Fig. 52). [...] "The entire fabrication has been simplified through the use of heavy rolled sections to make up the main stress members. Complex forgings are used in the top deck in place of the many steel stampings, thereby reducing a tremendous amount of fitting and manual welding." ...|$|E
