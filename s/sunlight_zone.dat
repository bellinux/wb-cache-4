All endemics have been recorded between , but the majority mainly live at shallower depths. About 30 freshwater snail species can be seen deeper than , which represents the approximate limit of the <b>sunlight</b> <b>zone,</b> but only 10 are truly deepwater species. In general, Baikal snails are thin-shelled and small. Two {{of the most common}} species are Benedictia baicalensis and Megalovalvata baicalensis. Bivalve diversity is lower with more than 30 species; about half of these, all in the families Euglesidae, Pisidiidae, and Sphaeriidae, are endemic (the only other family in the lake is Unionidae with a single non-endemic species). The endemic bivalves are mainly found in shallows, with few species from deep water.|$|E
5000|$|... {{the snail}} {{has been found}} between sea level and a maximum {{recorded}} depth of 88 m below sea level. which means it lives in the <b>sunlight</b> <b>zone</b> of the pelagic.|$|E
5000|$|They {{all share}} a common [...] "strangling" [...] growth habit that is found in many {{tropical}} forest species, particularly of the genus Ficus. This growth habit is an adaptation for growing in dark forests where the competition for light is intense. These plants begin life as hemiepiphytes, when their seeds, often bird-dispersed, germinate in crevices atop other trees. These seedlings grow their roots downward and envelop the host tree while also growing upward to reach into the <b>sunlight</b> <b>zone</b> above the canopy.|$|E
50|$|Lake {{ecosystems}} can {{be divided}} into zones. One common system divides lakes into three zones (see figure). The first, the littoral zone, is the shallow zone near the shore. This is where rooted wetland plants occur. The offshore is divided into two further zones, an open water zone and a deep water zone. In the open water zone (or photic <b>zone)</b> <b>sunlight</b> supports photosynthetic algae, and the species that feed upon them. In the deep water <b>zone,</b> <b>sunlight</b> is not available and the food web is based on detritus entering from the littoral and photic zones. Some systems use other names. The off shore areas may be called the pelagic zone, the photic zone may be called the limnetic zone and the aphotic zone may be called the profundal zone. Inland from the littoral zone one can also frequently identify a riparian zone which has plants still affected by the presence of the lakeâ€”this can include effects from windfalls, spring flooding, and winter ice damage. The production of the lake as a whole is the result of production from plants growing in the littoral zone, combined with production from plankton growing in the open water.|$|R
5000|$|The photic zone, {{euphotic}} zone (Greek for [...] "well lit": [...] "well" [...] + [...] "light"), or <b>sunlight</b> or (Sunlit) <b>zone</b> is {{the depth of}} the water in a lake or ocean that is exposed to such intensity of sunlight which designates compensation point, i.e. the intensity of light at which the rate of carbon dioxide uptake, or equivalently, the rate of oxygen production, is equal to the rate of carbon dioxide production, equivalently to the rate of oxygen consumption, reducing thus the net carbon dioxide assimilation to zero.|$|R
50|$|B. coriacea is {{cultivated}} {{in the high}} Andes as a field windbreak, {{as a source of}} humus for soil improvement, and as high quality, rotproof timber for use in building construction and manufacture of agricultural tools. The shrub was introduced to horticulture in the UK circa 1994, and specimens are held as part of the NCCPG national collection at the Longstock Park Nursery, near Stockbridge. Although not entirely hardy in the UK, the shrub can survive most winters with a modicum of protection; overwinter waterlogging regarded as a greater danger to the plant. The shrub has never been known to flower in the UK owing to either the insufficient intensity or duration of <b>sunlight.</b> Hardiness: USDA <b>zone</b> 9.|$|R
50|$|A coccolithophore (or coccolithophorid, {{from the}} adjective) is a unicellular, {{eukaryotic}} phytoplankton (alga). They belong {{either to the}} kingdom Protista, according to Robert Whittaker's Five kingdom classification, or clade Hacrobia, according to the newer biological classification system. Within the Hacrobia, the coccolithophorids are in the phylum or division Haptophyta, class Prymnesiophyceae (or Coccolithophyceae). Coccolithophorids are distinguished by special calcium carbonate plates (or scales) of uncertain function called coccoliths, which are also important microfossils. However, there are Prymnesiophyceae species lacking coccoliths (e.g. in genus Prymnesium), so not every member of Prymnesiophyceae is coccolithophorid. Coccolithophores are almost exclusively marine and are found in large numbers throughout the <b>sunlight</b> <b>zone</b> of the ocean.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn mid-and high-latitude oceans, winter surface cooling {{and strong}} winds drive {{turbulent}} mixing that carries phytoplankton to depths {{of several hundred}} metres, well below the sunlit layer. This downward mixing, in combination with low solar radiation, drastically limits phytoplankton growth during the winter, especially that of the diatoms and other species {{that are involved in}} seeding the spring bloom. Here we present observational evidence for widespread winter phytoplankton blooms in {{a large part of the}} North Atlantic subpolar gyre from autonomous profiling floats equipped with biogeochemical sensors. These blooms were triggered by intermittent restratification of the mixed layer when mixed-layer eddies led to a horizontal transport of lighter water over denser layers. Combining a bio-optical index with complementary chemotaxonomic and modelling approaches, we show that these restratification events increase phytoplankton residence time in the <b>sunlight</b> <b>zone,</b> resulting in greater light interception and the emergence of winter blooms. Restratification also caused a phytoplankton community shift from pico-and nanophytoplankton to phototrophic diatoms. We conclude that transient winter blooms can maintain active diatom populations throughout the winter months, directly seeding the spring bloom and potentially making a significant contribution to over-winter carbon export...|$|E
40|$|Background: Studies in the {{northern}} and southern hemispheres consistently identified seasonal influences on monthly and semester suicide distribution. The variations of <b>sunlight</b> exposure in <b>zones</b> of increasing latitude has been suggested {{as one of the most}} plausible explanations for this phenomenon. Some recent studies in {{the northern}} hemisphere could not find seasonal asymmetries of suicides. The current study examines the monthly, seasonal and semester distribution of suicidal deaths in Chile and the influence of seasons in zones of low latitude as compared with regions of high or very high latitude, trying to determine if a seasonal pattern still exists in a country of the southern hemisphere. Methods: Monthly, seasonal and semester suicidal data over the period 1995 - 1999 were examined for the whole sample and for gender-specific subgroups in Chile. Four different latitudinal zones were analyzed separately, in order to investigate the effect of the photoperiod on suicide distribution. Results were analyzed by chi(2) tests for multinomials, as an overall measure of deviation. Results: We found a significant unimodal springtime peak for both genders in the global territory. Among the 4, 710 male and 829 female suicides reported in this period there were no gender differences in the seasonal pattern of suicidal deaths. When divided into four different latitudinal zones, the regions with low latitude (north of the country) showed no significant differences, while central and southern zones (higher latitude) show a significant springtime pattern. In the extreme south of the country, no significant differences were found, probably due to the very small number of cases. Conclusion: The study confirms the existence of a unimodal springtime peak of suicides in Chile, but not in the zone of low latitude. Results support the notion that the seasonal impact on suicidal distribution is a function of photoperiod...|$|R
40|$|Zygotes of fucoid algae {{have long}} been studied as a {{paradigm}} for cell polarity. Polarity is established early in the first cell cycle and is then expressed as localized growth and invariant cell division. The fertilized egg is a spherical cell and, by all accounts, bears little or no asymmetry. Polarity is acquired epigenetically {{a few hours later}} {{in the form of a}} rhizoid/thallus axis. The initial stage of polarization is axis selection, during which zygotes monitor environment gradients to determine the appropriate direction for rhizoid formation. In their natural setting in the intertidal <b>zone,</b> <b>sunlight</b> is probably the most important polarizing vector; rhizoids form away from the light. The mechanism by which zygotes perceive environmental gradients and transduce that information into an intracellular signal is unknown but may involve a phosphatidylinositol cycle. Once positional information has been recorded, the cytoplasm and membrane are reorganized in accordance with the vectorial information. The earliest detectable asymmetries in the polarizing zygote are localized secretion and generation of a transcellular electric current. Vesicle secretion and the inward limb of the current are localized at the presumptive rhizoid. The transcellular current may establish a cytoplasmic Ca 2 + gradient constituting a morphogenetic field, but this remains controversial. Localized secretion and establishment of transcellular current are sensitive to treatment with cytochalasins, indicating that cytoplasmic reorganization is dependent on the actin cytoskeleton. The nascent axis at first is labile and susceptible to reorientation by subsequent environmental vectors but soon becomes irreversibly fixed in its orientation. Locking the axis in place requires both cell wall and F-actin and is postulated to involve an indirect transmembrane bridge linking cortical actin to cell wall. This bridge anchors relevant structures at the presumptive rhizoid and thereby stabilizes the axis. Approximately halfway through the first cell cycle, the latent polarity is expressed morphologically in the form of rhizoid growth. Elongation is by tip growth and does not appear to be fundamentally different from tip growth in other organisms. The zygote always divides perpendicular to the growth axis, and this is controlled by the microtubule cytoskeleton. Two microtubule-organizing centers on the nuclear envelope rotate such that they align with the growth axis. They then serve as spindle poles during mitosis. Cytokinesis bisects the axial spindle, resulting in a transverse crosswall. Although the chronology of cellular events associated with polarity is by now rather detailed, causal mechanisms remain obscure...|$|R
40|$| locations. Cottages, farmhouses, {{contemporary}} minimal houses, castles, building lots. It {{was very}} difficult for them, not only to find a fitting building or site, but also to find the style or feel they wanted. Do they want a contemporary house, or an over the top cottage, and where? In the city? In the countryside? Everything was on the table. Eventually an old cottage villa at the coast was found, without delivering lot of architectural input, we felt that the location and feel of this house seemed fitting for them. A long road of pro-bono searching ended. Meanwhile the clients got doubts about working with us, instigated by some acquaintances and family, saying we are to â€˜visionaryâ€™. So we didnâ€™t hear from them anymore. For six months. Apparently, in those months, they contacted 11 architects for the project. Visited al lot of their projects, made appointments. Oh dear. In the end, after half a year in silence, they called us anyway, saying they want us to do their project. We found the whole process, while somewhat comical, inspiring. House or farm, city or countryside, renovation or newly built, cottage or contemporary, this architect or that architect? This opposition became the core of the design process for us. A printout of the duality and doubts of the clients. The human context. It becomes a fascinating rag doll. The project involves the renovation and restoration of the protected villa, with a focus on strengthening the existing character. The project is actually quite rational. The client absolutely wanted a large basement underneath the house. The house is registered and protected by the city hall, so demolishing it is impossible. A challenge. Building the basement, means that we have to hold up the entire house above the ground floor. So we decided this is a perfect basis for the design. We just cut the entire house under the roof, so the whole ground floor can be glazed. The transparent ground floor sets itself inferior to the villa above, of which the roof sits firmly above the whole. There is an interaction between new and old. A transparent contemporary atmosphere in contrast with the atmosphere of the early 20 th century. All facades remain untouched in its totality and current form. We consider it actually as a useful relic, nestled in a new structure and infrastructure. The house doesnâ€™t really change from the surroundings. Itâ€™s only from the inside that the drastic change becomes visible. It is actually a beautiful contrast. The glazed ground floor and the protected cottage above. A good expression of duality we found in the clients. And they will have it all: city and countryside, renovation and newly built, cottage and contemporary, this architect and that architect. 5. 	 Zoning is really important for the typical urban planner in Belgium. We are, on the other hand, in total disagreement with walling off different uses in zones. With this project, called FACTORY ROOF HOUSES, we are hinting towards combining these things. Treating a factory roof, which is otherwise unused (water impermeable) surface, as a building lot for housing can provide a small answer to the ever increasing population pressure. The industrial building itself is a simple rectangular stirdy volume. The roof houses on top are built in a simple way. Basic and affordable timber framed buildings with a spacious outside area. This outdoor space, which is actually an extension of the interior space, offers a very spatial and unique character. Researching and developing genuine possibilities and creating new perspectives in day to day (built) projects is how we like to see sustainability. Perhaps it is not a utopia: Recuperating the gigantic amount of factory roofs as a second level for housing, farming or trading could maybe offer a fresh perspective on how to use our already crammed up landscape. 6. 	 The next project is called AVALON. Avalon is an in the mists hidden island. It houses 40 apartments. The presence of private and public areas was very important and the guiding principle. In terms of sustainability, the lifecycle and the lifespan of the building needs to be optimal. The master plan provides a long-range vision: adaptation, extension and conversion in view of the changing needs or desires (lifestyles) of the users is perfectly possible. This housing block had a very wide footprint, which means that there are always (less valued) north faced apartments and (more valued) south faced ones. We asked ourselves how to resolve this issue, and get direct sunlight in the north faced apartments. Thanks to recesses and cut-outs defined by the azimuth of the sun, natural light enters {{into the heart of the}} building. This ensures thermal gains while the openings and the generous terraces also allow light and sun in the flats. Moreover, they soften the monolithic and massive character of the building and provide a better connection with the smaller scale of the surroundings. Avalon is an ideal holistic community. On the level of urban development and architecture, it is a sustainable building with complete coherence in the social, cultural, agricultural, architectural and urban field. It is a composition of light and darkness, of watching and being watched, of sound and silence, a psychic metabolism. The matrix is based on a necessity that characterizes the naturalness of both the use and the perception of space. Avalon is a sustainable building in a social, ecological, economical and ethical context. 7. 	 The last project I want to show, RAVELIJN, is a competition we won for a city â€‹â€‹densification in Zoutleeuw, Vlaams Brabant. The assignment is a large park containing a large residential care center, 45 houses, renovation of the old town hall and a youth center, mainly for scouts. The building permit for this project just approved this week actually. It is actually a PPS, public private collaboration. Our clients are thus both the city of Zoutleeuw and partners of Ackermans & Van Haaren. We are somewhat in the middle. Anyway, this was the plan attached to the competition, the RUP zoning. Analysing the site, we really felt that the zone for residential care center was badly located. In the shadows of a large water extraction plant. A permanent twilight zone without any place with direct <b>sunlight.</b> Also, the <b>zone</b> has an important buffer function, it shields the massive water factory. The planned location of the nursing home in this area seems therefore inappropriate. On the other hand the building for the youth center seemed to fit perfectly in this forest area. It is a lot smaller, so the tree area can remain entirely intact, a play forest which is also a green buffer. The original location for the Youth building on the other hand, has a sublime relationship of with the beautiful surroundings with light, visibility, silence and air quality. The nursibg home can have a strong relationship with the housing project there. Think of shared utilities. So we decided to switch these two zones in our proposal. Which is quite risky. But we believe so strongly in this human context, we convinced our partners there was no other way. This is the only good solution. This drastic point of view won us the competition. It opened the eyes of the city department, and actually shut it for the other projects in the competition. The architectural form became unimportant. It shows the importance of human context. The physical context then shaped the architecture into these environments. The youth center becomes a concrete bunker in the middle of the forest. A bunker that is turned towards the inside patio but can be opened or closed entirely to the forest with large sectional garage doors. The houses form a compact group with play streets and south oriented gardens, based on the Vauban shape of the former strongholds. The nursing home is a building under an intensive green roof that forms a raised surface. The building is solid and low. It embraces and protects itâ€™s residents. In the top of the plinth, on the terraces, there is a space for plants or vegetables. This way, the facade is a true interactive green facade, at the same time activating the lives of seniors by letting them take care of the plants. Take care and be cared for. Again it shows that every project we do begins and ends with the human context. Outroductionstatus: publishe...|$|R
