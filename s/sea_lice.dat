5|$|Animals are {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} diseases and conditions that may affect their health. Some, like classical swine fever and scrapie are specific to one type of stock, while others, like foot-and-mouth disease affect all cloven-hoofed animals. Where the condition is serious, governments impose regulations on import and export, on the movement of stock, quarantine restrictions and the reporting of suspected cases. Vaccines are available against certain diseases, and antibiotics are widely used where appropriate. At one time, antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth, but this practice is now frowned on in many countries because of the risk that it may lead to antibiotic resistance. Animals living under intensive conditions are particularly prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of <b>sea</b> <b>lice</b> are affecting farmed salmon in Scotland. Reducing the parasite burdens of livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.|$|E

In 2002, the British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food ordered farm fallowing (i. e., the removal of farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar from net-cages) along the presumed migration route of wild juvenile Pacific salmon in this area. The goal was to protect wild juvenile fish from <b>sea</b> <b>louse</b> infestation. We assessed {{the effectiveness of this}} decision by comparing <b>sea</b> <b>louse</b> infestation rates on wild juvenile salmon near three Atlantic salmon farm sites prior to, during, and after fallowing. Overall, L. salmonis levels were significantly reduced (P! 0. 0001) at the study sites during fallowing but returned to the original level after fallowing. The decline was age specific. While the abundance of the earliest attached <b>sea</b> <b>louse</b> phase (the copepodid stage) declined by a factor of 42, the mean abundance of adult L. salmonis did not decline significantly. Changes in salinity and temperature could not account for the decline. This study provides evidence that the fallowing of Atlantic salmon farms during spring juvenile salmon migrations can be an effective conservation and management tool for protecting wild salmon.

40|$|The salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, is a {{crustacean}} ectoparasite of salmonid fish. At present, <b>sea</b> <b>louse</b> {{control on}} salmon farms relies heavily upon chemical treatments. Drug efflux transport, mediated by ABC transporters such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp), represents a major mechanism for drug resistance in parasites. We report here the molecular cloning {{of a new}} Pgp from the salmon louse, called SL-PGY 1. A partial Pgp sequence was obtained by searching <b>sea</b> <b>louse</b> ESTs, and extended by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The open reading frame of SL-PGY 1 encodes a protein of 1438 amino acids that possesses typical structural traits of P-glycoproteins, and shows {{a high degree of}} sequence homology to invertebrate and vertebrate P-glycoproteins. In the absence of drug exposure, SL-PGY 1 mRNA expression levels did not differ between a drug-susceptible strain of L. salmonis and a strain showing a ~ 7 -fold decrease in sensitivity against emamectin benzoate, the active component of the in-feed <b>sea</b> <b>louse</b> treatment SLICE® (Merck Animal Health). Aqueous exposure of the hyposensitive salmon louse strain to emamectin benzoate (24 h, 410 μg/L) provoked a 2. 9 -fold upregulation of SL-PGY 1. Adult male lice of both strains showed a greater abundance of SL-PGY 1 mRNA than adult females...|$|R
25|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>lice,</b> {{particularly}} Lepeophtheirus salmonis {{and various}} Caligus species, including C. clemensi and C. rogercresseyi, can cause deadly infestations of both farm-grown and wild salmon. <b>Sea</b> <b>lice</b> are ectoparasites which feed on mucus, blood, and skin, and migrate and latch onto {{the skin of}} wild salmon during free-swimming, planktonic nauplii and copepodid larval stages, which can persist for several days. Large numbers of highly populated, open-net salmon farms can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice; when exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms, many young wild salmon are infected, and do not survive as a result. Adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of <b>sea</b> <b>lice,</b> but small, thin-skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable. On the Pacific coast of Canada, the louse-induced mortality of pink salmon in some regions is commonly over 80%.|$|E

25|$|Intensive {{salmon farming}} uses open-net cages, which have low {{production}} costs. It has the drawback of allowing disease and <b>sea</b> <b>lice</b> to spread to local wild salmon stocks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>lice</b> cause {{physical}} and enzymatic damage at their sites of attachment and feeding {{which results in}} abrasion-like lesions that vary in their nature and severity depending upon a number of factors. These include host species, age and general health of the fish. It {{is not clear whether}} stressed fish are particularly prone to infestation. <b>Sea</b> <b>lice</b> infection causes a generalized chronic stress response in fish since feeding and attachment cause changes in the mucus consistency and damage the epithelium resulting in loss of blood and fluids, electrolyte changes, and cortisol release. This can decrease salmon immune responses and make them susceptible to other diseases and reduces growth and performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree of}} damage is also {{dependent}} on the species of <b>sea</b> <b>lice,</b> the developmental stages that are present, {{and the number of}} <b>sea</b> <b>lice</b> on a fish. There is little evidence of host tissue responses in Atlantic salmon at the sites of feeding and attachment, regardless of the development stage. In contrast, coho and pink salmon show strong tissue responses to L. salmonis characterized by epithelial hyperplasia and inflammation. This results in rejection of the parasite within the first week of infection in these species of salmonids. Heavy infections of farmed Atlantic salmon and wild sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) by L. salmonis can lead to deep lesions, particularly on the head region, even exposing the skull.|$|E

Lepeophtheirus salmonis can parasitize other salmonids to varying degrees, including brown trout (sea trout: Salmo trutta), Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), and all species of Pacific salmon. In the case of Pacific salmon, coho, chum, and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch, O. keta, and O. gorbuscha, respectively) mount strong tissue responses to attaching L. salmonis, which lead to rejection within {{the first week of}} infection. Pacific L. salmonis can also develop, but not complete, its full life cycle on the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). This has not been observed with Atlantic L. salmonis.|$|R

Hearts were extirpated from intact or formalin-fixed specimens, then prepared for binocular and histological examinations. In the prawn, a paired aorta diverges forward from the anterior of the heart. Pericardium occurs on the base of this aorta, and envelops it completely. Posteriorly, an aorta runs backward, leaving the heart, and branches off another aorta which descends near its proximal area. Ventrally, the heart provides a paired arteria hepatica. In such aortae and arteriae there exist valvular systems at their proximal lumens. As for ostia, four on the ventral surface and six on the dorsal surface of the heart exist. The cardiac ganglion is situated within a nerve trunk that lies on the midline of inner surface of the dorsal wall of the heart. It contains nine cells, irregularly arranged. A cardiac nerve connects with the former after penetrating into dorsal wall at the middle point of the heart. In the <b>sea</b> <b>louse,</b> the posterior end of a tubular heart is blinded, and its anterior lengthens to become an anterior aorta. Near the proximal end of this aorta, a paired arteria lateralis anterior derives from the cardiac wall. In addition, three pairs of arteriae are provided along each side of the heart ventro-laterally. Each of their proximal lumens has a thin concave valve. Two paired ostia are distributed possessing distinct thick borders {{in the latter half of}} the heart along each of its lateral surfaces. The nerve trunk, containing the cardiac ganglion, runs along the midline of the inner surface of the dorsal wall of the heart. Cells of the ganglion are six in number, arranging regularly along the length of the trunk...|$|R
40|$|Cleaner fish (wrasse and lumpsucker) {{are used}} {{extensively}} in Norwegian salmon farms for biocontrol of <b>sea</b> <b>louse</b> infestation, but cleaner fish {{health and welfare}} has only recently become a focus of attention.

While A. salmonicida is an established fish pathogen, the relevance of V. splendidus for fish disease is less clear. Development of vaccines against bacterial pathogens of cleaner fish may be needed, but more knowledge is required regarding strains associated with these fish. In the present study, which focused mainly on wrasse, we examined bacterial infection levels in cleaner fish before and after salmon cage stocking, by culture and A. salmonicida real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR).

Analysis of osmoregulatory, metabolic, and stress markers allowed the derivation of a sublethal threshold burden of L. salmonis, above which the host suffers major physiological stress. Noticeable lice effects, consistent across all measured markers, were not observed until L. salmonis developed to the mobile preadult and adult stages.

Piecewise linear statistical approaches allowed the determination of abrupt changes in these physiological markers, attributable to the intensity of L. salmonis infestation on individual fish, and identification of overall threshold lice burdens. Thirteen mobile lice. fish - 1 (weight range 19 - 70 g) was a consistent breakpoint across several physiological measures. This information will provide a valuable, objectively derived tool to aid in the formulation of effective wild fisheries management policy concerning S. trutta conservation...|$|R
