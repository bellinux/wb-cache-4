The VHCF regime is associated with stress amplitudes lower than the conventional fatigue limit and numbers of cycles higher than 109.

The mechanisms leading to crack initiation express via slip bands at the specimen surface and self-heating due to intrinsic dissipation.

The cross sections, interface microstructures, hardness and tensile properties of Al/steel butt joints obtained under different travel speeds and laser beam offsets were investigated. The phase morphology and thickness of the intermetallic compound (IMC) layers at the interface were analyzed by <b>scanning</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>microscopes</b> (SEM) using the energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) techniques.

This proves that the IMC layers consist of Fe 2 Al 5 phases and Fe 4 Al 13 phases by EBSD phase mapping. Increasing laser beam offsets from 0. 3 mm to 0. 7 mm significantly decreases the quantity of Fe 4 Al 13 phases and the thickness of Fe 2 Al 5 layers at the interface.
