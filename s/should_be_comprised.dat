The method applied in the study is legal dogmatics. The study does not try to prove any predefined hypothesis, but it rather aims to systematize the international legal order by identifying which legal and other regulations validly apply when military force is used by or on behalf of the United Nations. The study ends to a conclusion that the human rights law (HRL), and not the international humanitarian law (IHL), is the legal framework applicable to United Nations peace operations. However, the study recognizes that the regime of international humanitarian law applies also to United Nations under the same conditions it applies to other actors in situations of armed conflict.

In anionic form, β-triketones undergo slow dark oxidation and photolysis with polychromatic quantum yields varying from 1. 2 × 10 − 4 to 3. 7 × 10 − 4. Leptospermone and grandiflorone are the most photolabile compounds. In molecular form, β-triketones are rather volatile. Polychromatic quantum yields between 1. 2 × 10 − 3 and 1. 8 × 10 − 3 could be measured for leptospermone and grandiflorone. They are 3 – 5 times higher than for the anionic forms. Photooxidation on the carbon atom bearing the acidic hydrogen atom is the main oxidation reaction, common to all the β-triketones whatever their ionization state. However, leptospermone shows a special photoreactivity. In molecular form, it mainly undergoes photoisomerization.

Physical activity guidelines from leading organisations including the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) [10] recommend RT frequency of 2 to 3  days per week (days week−[*] 1) for healthy adults. These frequency recommendations are however notional, derived from conjecture rather than robust scientific evidence. This lack of evidence weakens established recommendations regarding progressive RT loading and training volumes for improved muscular strength [11]. Several RT studies have reported that an RT frequency of 2 to 3  days week−[*] 1 for previously untrained individuals’ [12 – 15] produces optimum strength gains. Feigenbaum and Pollock [13] suggest that a single set program of 15 repetitions performed at a frequency of 2 to 3  days week−[*] 1 allows for sufficient regeneration, while still providing 80 – 90 % strength gains of more frequent RT programs.
