5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is usually}} an acute and <b>self-limiting</b> disease {{that does not}} require medication. The {{preferred}} treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be helpful, and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} is {{generally}} mild and <b>self-limiting</b> with most symptoms generally improving in a week. Half of cases go away in 10days and 90% in 15days. Severe complications, if they occur, are {{usually in the}} very old, the very young, or those who are immunosuppressed. Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in sinusitis, pharyngitis, or an ear infection. It is estimated that sinusitis occurs in 8% and ear infection in 30% of cases.|$|E
5|$|Treatment was {{initially}} limited to aspirin and warfarin, but the 1990s saw {{the introduction of}} a number of agents that could provide anticoagulation without a risk of recurrent HIT. Older terminology distinguishes between two forms of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: type 1 (mild, non-immune mediated and <b>self-limiting</b> fall in platelet count) and type 2, the form described above. Currently, the term HIT is used without a modifier to describe the immune-mediated severe form.|$|E
40|$|Cryptosporidium is a coccidian {{parasite}} that infects the {{gastrointestinal tract}} in humans {{and can cause}} severe enteritis and malabsorption. Cryptosporidiosis is <b>self-limited</b> in immunocompetent persons, whereas in per-sons with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), Cryptosporidium infection causes persistent en-teritis that is usually lifelong and refractory to treatment (1). In our clinical practices, we observed men infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had <b>self-limited</b> diarrhea due to Cryptosporidium infection. To better define the laboratory and clinical characteris-tics associated with <b>self-limited</b> compared with persist-ent disease, we did a retrospective chart review of HIV-seropositive patients with Cryptosporidium infec-tion.

5|$|HSP is a {{systemic}} vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) and {{is characterized by}} deposition of immune complexes containing the antibody immunoglobulin A (IgA); the exact cause for this phenomenon is unknown. In children it usually resolves within several weeks and requires no treatment apart from symptom control, but may relapse in a third of cases and cause irreversible kidney damage in about one in a hundred cases. In adults the prognosis is different than in children. The average duration of cutaneous lesions is 27.9 months. And for many {{it tends to be}} relapsing-remitting {{over a long period of}} time rather than <b>self-limiting</b> and there tend to be more complications.|$|E
5|$|A rapid strep test may assist a {{clinician}} {{in deciding}} whether to prescribe an antibiotic to a person with pharyngitis, a common infection of the throat. Viral infections {{are responsible for the}} majority of pharyngitis, but a significant proportion (20% to 40% in children and 5% to 15% in adults) is caused by bacterial infection. The symptoms of viral and bacterial infection may be indistinguishable, but only bacterial pharyngitis can be effectively treated by antibiotics. Since the major cause of bacterial pharyngitis is GAS, the presence of this organism in a person's throat may be seen as a necessary condition for prescribing antibiotics. GAS pharyngitis is a <b>self-limiting</b> infection that will usually resolve within a week without medication. However, antibiotics may reduce the length and severity of the illness and reduce the risk of certain rare but serious complications.|$|E
5|$|Like all lifeforms, new {{strains of}} E. coli evolve through the natural {{biological}} processes of mutation, gene duplication, and horizontal gene transfer; in particular, 18% {{of the genome}} of the laboratory strain MG1655 was horizontally acquired since the divergence from Salmonella. E. coli K-12 and E. coli B strains are {{the most frequently used}} varieties for laboratory purposes. Some strains develop traits that can be harmful to a host animal. These virulent strains typically cause a bout of diarrhea that is often <b>self-limiting</b> in healthy adults but is frequently lethal to children in the developing world. More virulent strains, such as , cause serious illness or death in the elderly, the very young, or the immunocompromised.|$|E

5|$|Known as viremia, the {{presence}} of a virus in the bloodstream enables it to be widely distributed throughout the body. Poliovirus can survive and multiply within the blood and lymphatics for long periods of time, sometimes as long as 17 weeks. In a small percentage of cases, it can spread and replicate in other sites, such as brown fat, the reticuloendothelial tissues, and muscle. This sustained replication causes a major viremia, and leads to the development of minor influenza-like symptoms. Rarely, this may progress and the virus may invade the central nervous system, provoking a local inflammatory response. In most cases, this causes a <b>self-limiting</b> inflammation of the meninges, the layers of tissue surrounding the brain, which is known as nonparalytic aseptic meningitis. Penetration of the CNS provides no known benefit to the virus, and is quite possibly an incidental deviation of a normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus spreads to the CNS are poorly understood, but it appears to be primarily a chance event—largely independent of the age, gender, or socioeconomic position of the individual.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: After acute <b>self-limited</b> {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) infection, serological loss of viral antigens {{and appearance}} of anti-HBs is generally believed to signify viral clearance. Latent and occult HBV infection appearing decades after <b>self-limited</b> hepatitis B {{has not been}} reported, nor has the evolutionary rate of HBV DNA over the same observation period. METHODS: DNA from serum and leukocytes from 16 patients with acute <b>self-limited</b> hepatitis B 30 years earlier was tested by polymerase chain reaction and positive samples were sequenced. Liver tissue from four patients was also tested. Additionally, another 10 HBV strains isolated from acute HBV cases in 1969 - 72 were compared to 11 strains isolated from acute cases in 1998 - 99 in the same community. RESULTS: HBV DNA was detected in liver from two patients, but not in serum or leukocytes. The HBV strains detected in liver showed complete homology, in the sequences analyzed, to the strains originally infecting these patients. Ten strains from 1998 - 99 were identical in pre-S and core promoter/precore regions to strains from the same community isolated 30 years earlier. CONCLUSIONS: HBV can persist as an occult infection three decades after acute, apparently <b>self-limited</b> hepatitis B, and both the mutation and evolutionary rates of HBV DNA are low...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis C virus {{infection}} {{leads to}} {{a high rate of}} chronicity. Mechanisms of viral clearance and persistence are still poorly understood. In this study, hepatic gene expression analysis was performed to identify any molecular signature associated with the outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in chimpanzees. Acutely HCV-infected chimpanzees with <b>self-limited</b> infection or progression to chronicity were studied. Interferon stimulated genes were induced irrespective of the outcome of infection. Early induction of a set of genes associated with cell proliferation and immune activation was associated with subsequent viral clearance. Specifically, two of the genes: interleukin binding factor 3 (ILF 3) and cytotoxic granule-associated RNA binding protein (TIA 1), associated with robust T-cell response, were highly induced early in chimpanzees with <b>self-limited</b> infection. Up-regulation of genes associated with CD 8 + T cell response was evident only during the clearance phase of the acute <b>self-limited</b> infection. The induction of these genes may represent an initial response of cellular injury and proliferation that successfully translates to a "danger signal" leading to induction of adaptive immunity to control viral infection. This primary difference in hepatic gene expression between <b>self-limited</b> and chronic infections supports the concept that successful activation of HCV-specific T-cell response is critical in clearance of acute HCV infection...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe GTPase dynamin assembles at the necks of budded vesicles in vivo and {{functions}} in membrane fission. We have developed fluid supported bilayers with excess membrane reservoir, (SUPER) templates, to assay vesicle formation and membrane fission. Consistent with previous studies, {{in the absence}} of GTP, dynamin assembles in spirals, forming long membrane tubules. GTP addition triggers disassembly, but not membrane fission, arguing against models in which fission is mediated by concerted and global GTP-driven conformational changes. In contrast, under physiological conditions in the constant presence of GTP, dynamin mediates membrane fission. Under these conditions, fluorescently labeled dynamin cooperatively organizes into <b>self-limited</b> assemblies that continuously cycle at the membrane and drive vesicle release. When visualized at the necks of emergent vesicles, <b>self-limited</b> dynamin assemblies display intensity fluctuations and persist for variable time periods before fission. Thus, <b>self-limited</b> assemblies of dynamin generated in the constant presence of GTP catalyze membrane fission...|$|R
