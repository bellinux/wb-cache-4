40|$|AbstractThis paper {{explored}} {{the effect of}} MDI, UF and FRW content on the mechanical and fire retardant property of <b>straw</b> based <b>panels</b> with surface alkali liquor processing. In order to manufacture the <b>straw</b> based <b>panel</b> with high quality, low toxic and fire retardant, the interface of wheat-straw was treated with alkaline liquid, and the orthogonal test was carried out to optimize the technical parameters. The conductivity and diffusion coefficient K of the straw material after alkaline liquid treatment increased obviously. This indicated that alkaline liquid treatment improved the surface wet ability of straw, which is helpful for the infiltration of resin. The results of orthogonal test showed that the optimized treating condition was alkaline liquid concentration as 0. 4 - 0. 8 %, alkaline dosage as 1 : 2. 5 - 1 : 4. 5, alkalinetreated time as 12 h- 48 h. The physical and mechanical properties of wheat-straw boards after treated increased remarkably and it could satisfy the national standard. The improvement of the straw surface wet ability is helpful to the forming of chemical bond. Whereas the variance analysis of the fire retardant property of <b>straw</b> based <b>panel</b> showed that TTI, pkHRR and peak value appearance time were not affected by the MDI, UF and FRW content significantly.

30|$|With the {{increasing}} consumption of wood-based materials and scarcity of wood resources, {{it is inevitable}} that some substitutions are needed and wood residues should be fully utilized. So far, much research has been devoted to the use of non-wood lignocellulosic materials, such as reeds, wheat, and rice straw, as a partial or complete substitute for wood in the preparation of boards for structural and non-structural panel applications. Low density <b>straw</b> <b>panels</b> have already been suggested for application in thermal and acoustic insulation [8]. Yang et al. [9] using rice straw manufactured insulation board. The composite boards prepared with randomly cut rice straw and wood particles with low specific gravity were found to be suitable as a sound absorbing insulation material. Ajiwe et al. [10] produced ceiling boards from agricultural waste, such as rice husks and saw dust. The results confirmed that the board produced was similar to a commercial board. Han et al. [11 – 14]. conducted a series of studies using reeds and wheat straw as material for preparing particleboard and examined the effect of particle size and board density on the board properties. In addition, silicon coupling agents were used to improve the bonding ability between the reeds and wheat particles and urea–formaldehyde (UF) resin, and mechanism underlying the bonding improvement was investigated. Nikvash et al. [15] used agri-fibers, bagasse, canola, and hemp, as well as industrial wood chips in various proportions ranging from 0 to 100  % to make wood composite panels and suggested that one possible application for those panels is furniture production.|$|R

40|$|Crop-based {{materials}} show many {{qualities in}} the quest for construction products with low environmental impact in the construction sector. Their ability to exchange moisture with indoor air offers new opportunities for improving interior user comfort and eventually buildings energy performance. Modeling their hygrothermal behavior has thus focused much attention, one of the main objectives being to assess more objectively the resulting performance at building scale. The first natural step in this modeling process is to understand the specific dynamics of heat and mass transfer within such materials. The Building Element Heat Air and Moisture (BEHAM) numerical models were designed to accurately predict internal conditions encountered in materials with partial balance equations. This envelope-based approach, however, requires the knowing of the interior and exterior climate conditions prior to the study. Therefore, it forbids any assessment of mutual exchange between the envelope to the indoor air and prevents any serious validation of the overall performance of materials. In response to this problem, the importance of developing whole building hygrothermal model has recently been raised. General scientific computational tools like MATLAB seem particularly adapted to perform this scaling-up, given their high flexibility and tools integration potentialities. In this communication we study a prefabricated <b>straw</b> bale <b>panel</b> subjected to two distinct and simple solicitations in a climatic chamber. A whole building hygrothermal model developed in MATLAB is then validated with the experimental datasets. The evolution of indoor conditions under the different tests is analyzed in details with an assessment of straw bales performance...|$|R
40|$|Modelling the hygrothermal {{behaviour}} of crop-based insulation {{products is}} essential to assess {{their impact on the}} energy performance of the building, predict indoor climate conditions, and prevent any risk of unexpected degradation. Traditionally, transient numerical models that predict internal conditions of construction materials consider that the variation of moisture storage with temperature is negligible although the sorp- tion behaviour is known to be temperature dependent. This paper investigates this par- ticular effect for crop-based materials and uses a refinement of standard mathematical representations. For this purpose, the effects of a thermal shock on the evolution of hygrothermal conditions inside a straw-bale wall are studied with several versions of a flexible research model. The latter is capable of incorporating the temperature depen- dency of the sorption curve with both a physically-based and an empirical description.

40|$|When {{developing}} new insulating materials, there is, in recent years, a pressure {{to replace the}} widely used polystyrene insulation for material, which is more sustainable and more eco-friendly. The shelf life of ETICS insulation on a building is around 25 – 30 years and that with proper care and repairs. When the polystyrene insulation is taken down from the building, {{there is a little}} to none chance of its recycling due to the residues of mortar and other building chemicals. When the insulation system on a building is repaired or replaced, a big advantage for the environment would be, if {{the main part of the}} system, as well as the whole system, would be biodegradable. For the sustainable building industry, the advantage is also in the source of the main raw material, as it is grown naturally instead of being chemically produced, as the polystyrene. That is the place, where the <b>straw</b> based insulating <b>panel</b> comes in.

40|$|Pine straw is a {{renewable}} {{natural resource}} that is under-utilized. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the physical and mechanical performances of pine <b>straw</b> composites. Three <b>panel</b> density levels (0. 8, 0. 9, 1. 0 g/cm 3) and two resin content levels (1 % pMDI + 4 % UF, 2 % pMDI + 4 % UF) were selected as treatments. For the pine-straw-bamboo-fiber composites, three pine-straw to bamboo-fiber ratios were selected as the treatments. The pine straw fibers were treated with a container blender, which reduced the fiber sizes and increased the roughness of fiber surfaces. The bending and IB strength properties of the pine straw boards meet the requirement of Class 5 of the voluntary product standard PS 60 - 73. Strength properties of the pine straw boards were positively correlated with the blending time. The waxy cutin on the surface of the needles was a barrier to the bonding quality and blending in the container blender was helpful in the removal of cutin from material surfaces. Linear relationship was found between the internal bond (IB) strength and board density. Higher pMDI resin content led to greater slope values of the IB-density regression lines. The addition of strong bamboo fibers significantly increased the bending and internal bond strength of the pine straw composites...|$|R
40|$|Off-site {{production}} is pointed {{out as a}} solution to the construction industry’s lack of efficiency. A way to produce off-site, without a high capital cost, can be found in temporary factories. It is the basis of a research project, which uses a concept of ‘Modern Flying Factories’ (MFFs). The concept is today novel and lacks a defined strategic positioning. However, temporary factories are not something unique and similar concepts can be found in Swedish field workshops and Flexible Field Factories for the construction industry and the concept of Mobile Manufacturing for the manufacturing industry. The {{purpose of this study is}} to increase the understanding and facilitate future strategic development by describing the MFF concept and suggest lessons for further development. The study is based on a literature review and a case study through interviews and observations of the concept in its current state with two pilot projects. The ‘Glenfrome project’ was the first pilot project in which timber and <b>straw</b> bale <b>panels</b> were produced for a school extension. Although the application of the concept managed to shorten the construction period, the project was considered to have potential for improved efficiency. The second pilot project, the ‘Battersea project’, produces utility cupboards to apartments in a major real estate development. This project was during the time of the study in its start-up phase and several difficulties were observed. The majority of them could be traced to the design. This study presents a description of the concept in seven propositions. It proposes that MFF is an off-site production strategy, which on projects applies a standardized process for start-up, operation and close down of a temporary factory. Its competiveness against stationary factories lies in allowing flexibility in location, time and production technique through low capital investment. The objective is to ensure time and quality as well save costs. The possibilities for achieving these are however restricted due to not having a continuous production process. Two alternative strategic directions have been identified for the concept in the future: continue with low investment costs to maintain flexibility or to automate the production to increase the efficiency. The lessons in this study are founded in the pilot projects, as well as what could be learned from theory of similar concepts and manufacturing improvement methods. Many of the lessons shows a need for an increased control over the start-up phase and are mainly concerning: decision making, early decisions and involvement of expertise, increased control over the design and production process and increased factory friendliness.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of traditional buildings reflects the uninterrupted {{development and the}} assimilation of the most worked out structural and architectural solutions. The new requirements of the EU regulations (from 2020 all new buildings must meet the requirement of almost zero-energy level) as well as applicable laws in Lithuania (the Lithuanian building regulations STR), however, set strict requirements which are difficult {{to apply to the}} traditional architecture [...] On the other hand, not all measures aimed at building energy efficiency are compatible with the concept of ecology (usually attributable to the traditional architecture). Due to the aforementioned confrontation, the purpose of this research is to use the comparative analysis method to examine some of the measures determining energy efficiency of a building and the rationality of these measures in the context of building’s lifecycle (which consists of construction, operation and demolition stages). One of the tested measures in this issue is the improvement of thermal properties of external envelope’s elements to meet the requirements of existing building regulations (according STR 2. 05. 01 : 2005). The research examines the ability of the improved thermal resistance of traditional buildings’ external envelope in assessing the benefits during the operation stage. The rationality is determined by comparing the energy savings during fifty-year-long lifespan (STR 2. 01. 09 : 2005) with the energy needed to produce the material (i. e. embodied energy). After comparing several different thermal insulation materials, e. g. mineral wool, EPS <b>panels,</b> <b>straw</b> insulation, the best solution is found. Besides the aforementioned, this research examines some principles of “passive design” applied in traditional buildings of various Lithuanian ethnographic regions. Four buildings varying in size, plan configuration, external envelope area, etc. were analyzed: “Viengale Pirkia” and “Dvigale Pirkia” from Dzūkija, “Troba” and “Kryžiavinis” houses from Žemaitija. The research is based on the methodology of evaluation of geometric efficiency by Parasonis, Keizikas et al. (2012 a, b). The findings allow us to make the following conclusions: 1. The research has indicated that the energy savings of insulated buildings (per lifetime period) are several times bigger than the energy needed to produce the applied insulation materials. 2. Based on the ratio of embodied energy and saved energy of tested materials, the research shows that the straw is the most rational insulation. It is also characterized as being a natural material as well as eliminating the additional energy inputs for recycling. However, it requires larger structures capable to withstand higher loads. 3. The research of geometric parameters of traditional houses has shown that the usage envelopes of “Troba” and “Kryžiavinis” houses is most efficient: “Troba” because of the most compact volume and “Kryžiavinis” because of the largest hosted floor area. 4. The comparative indicators of buildings compactness show that energy is saved more effectively in the examples of traditional volumetric and plan solutions of buildings (usually with pitched roofs), when comparing them to modern houses with flat roofs. Therefore, seeking minimum usage of materials for construction and improving energy efficiency during operation period, the traditional pitched roof is the best solution...|$|R
