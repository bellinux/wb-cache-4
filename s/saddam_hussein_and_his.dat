Although the initial strikes against Saddam were unsuccessful in killing the dictator or his generals, they were successful in effectively ending the ability to command and control Iraqi forces. Other strikes against key generals were successful and significantly degraded the command's ability to react to and maneuver against the U.S.-led invasion force coming from the south.|$|E

50|$|Adnan al-Dulaimi (Arabic: عدنان الدليمي) is a Sunni Iraqi {{politician}} who became prominent following the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 {{and the fall}} of the regime of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> He <b>and</b> <b>his</b> supporters have largely focused on two issues: ending the US occupation of Iraq; and strengthening and protecting the position of the country's Sunni-Arab minority {{at a time when the}} country's majority Shiite-Arabs have been in the political ascendancy.|$|R
25|$|SAD/SOG teams also {{conducted}} high risk special reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines to identify senior leadership targets. These missions {{led to the}} initial assassination attempts against Iraqi President <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> key generals. Although the initial air strike against Hussein was unsuccessful in killing the dictator, it was successful in effectively ending his ability to command and control his forces. Other strikes against key generals were successful and significantly degraded the command's ability to react to and maneuver against the U.S.-led invasion force. SAD operations officers were also successful in convincing key Iraqi army officers to surrender their units once the fighting started and/or not to oppose the invasion force.|$|E
25|$|On 10 April, a rumor {{emerged that}} <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> top aides {{were in a}} mosque complex in the Al Az'Amiyah District of Baghdad. Three {{companies}} of Marines were sent to capture him and {{came under heavy fire}} from rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and assault rifles. One Marine was killed and 20 were wounded, but neither Saddam or any of his top aides were found. U.S. forces supported by mortars, artillery, and aircraft continued to attack Iraqi forces still loyal to Saddam Hussein and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. U.S. aircraft flying in support were met with Iraqi anti-aircraft fire. On 12 April, by late afternoon, all fighting had ceased. A total of 34 American soldiers and 2,320 Iraqi fighters were killed.|$|E
500|$|The B-1 {{was first}} used in combat in support of {{operations}} in Iraq during Operation Desert Fox in December 1998, employing unguided GP weapons. B-1s have been subsequently used in Operation Allied Force (Kosovo) and, most notably, in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The B-1's role in Operation Allied Force has been criticized as the aircraft was not used until after enemy defenses had been suppressed by aircraft like the older B-52 {{it was intended to}} replace. The B-1 has deployed an array of conventional weapons in war zones, most notably the GBU-31, [...] Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM). In {{the first six months of}} Operation Enduring Freedom, eight B-1s dropped almost 40 percent of aerial ordnance, including some 3,900 JDAMs. JDAM munitions were heavily used by the B-1 over Iraq, notably on 7 April 2003 in an unsuccessful attempt to kill <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> two sons. At the height of the Iraq War, a B-1 was continuously kept airborne to provide rapid precision bombardment upon important targets as intelligence identified them. During Operation Enduring Freedom, the B-1 was able to raise its mission capable rate to 79%.|$|E

Thirteen-year-old Satellite (Soran Ebrahim) is known for his installation of dishes and antennae (for local villages who are looking for news of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein)</b> <b>and</b> for <b>his</b> limited knowledge of English. He is the dynamic, but manipulative leader of the children, organizing the dangerous but necessary sweeping and clearing of the minefields.

First Deputy Speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly Khaled al-Attiyah said [...] "we expected the maximum penalty against the criminal <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> henchmen because they committed horrible crimes against the Iraqi people, the Arabs, Kurds, Muslims and the entire Western community." ...|$|E
2500|$|Between 1993 and 2000, Khalilzad was the Director of the Strategy, Doctrine, and Force Structure at the RAND Corporation.

He also authored several influential monographs, including [...] "The United States and a Rising China" [...] and [...] "From Containment to Global Leadership? America and the World After the Cold War." [...] While at RAND, Khalilzad also had a brief stint consulting for Cambridge Energy Research Associates, {{which at the time}} was conducting a risk analysis for Unocal, now part of Chevron, for a proposed 1,400km (890 mile), $2-billion, [...] 622 m³/s (22,000ft³/s) Trans-Afghanistan gas pipeline project which would have extended from Turkmenistan to Afghanistan and further proceeding to Pakistan. Khalilzad was a signatory of the letter from members of the Project for the New American Century to President Bill Clinton sent on January 26, 1998, which called for him to accept the aim of [...] "removing <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> regime from power" [...] using [...] "a full complement of diplomatic, political and military efforts." ...|$|E

50|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the attacks, the Bush administration declared a war on terrorism, with the stated goals of bringing Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda to justice and preventing the emergence of other terrorist networks. These goals were to be accomplished by means including economic and military sanctions against states perceived as harboring terrorists and increasing global surveillance and intelligence sharing. Within hours after the September 11 attacks, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld speculated on possible involvement by <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> ordered <b>his</b> aides to make plans for striking Iraq; although unfounded, the association contributed to public acceptance for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The second-biggest operation of the US Global War on Terrorism outside of the United States, and the largest directly connected to terrorism, was the overthrow of the Taliban rule from Afghanistan, by a US-led coalition.|$|R

What was your main mission in creating this film?" [...] Eric Manes responded, [...] "Our goal was simply to give the Iraqi people a voice. [...] For years we had heard only the American media’s version of what Iraq and its people were like. We decided that since Iraq was such a major issue in the U.S., it was time to hear their story first-hand. Iraqis are a wonderfully diverse group {{of people who have been}} silenced for over 24 years, living in fear of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> regime. We realized we could finally give Iraqis a venue to freely share their lives, hopes and dreams with the rest of the world now that he was no longer in complete control of the country." [...] When questioned on the film's budget, Martin Kunert said, [...] "We used single chip, GR-D30U JVC cameras, which you can buy used on the net for around $230." [...] "Our budget came out to around $500,000. With inexpensive cameras and editing stations, the greatest expense was our post-production staff: translators and assistant editors. Second to that, the 35 mm blow-up." ...|$|E
