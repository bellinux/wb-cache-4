The local railroad foreman did not approve and later seized the vehicle and destroyed it. As a child, Haynes {{had an interest in}} chemistry and metallurgy and when he was 15 he built a <b>smelting</b> <b>furnace</b> and began working with copper, bronze, and iron. Haynes was also interested in nature and spent considerable time in the forest cataloging and observing plants, insects, and animals. Because he spent so much time there, his family nicknamed him [...] "Wood", a nickname they used [...] for most of his life. As he grew older, he became an avid reader of books, including Principles of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry by William Wells. His early experiments and studies interested him in the fundamental properties of matter, and he was intrigued by how [...] mixing [...] compounds could create completely different alloys.|$|E
2500|$|The {{contemporary}} {{knowledge of}} slagging gives insights into ancient iron production. In a <b>smelting</b> <b>furnace,</b> {{up to four}} different phases might co-exist. From {{the top of the}} furnace to the bottom, the phases are slag, matte, speiss, and liquid metal.|$|E

The oxidized iron is skimmed off, while the sulfur dioxide gas is captured and sent to an on-site acid plant for conversion to valuable sulfuric acid - a million tons of it each year.|$|E

Two lots were purchased by Rittenhouse on July 18, 1792, at Seventh Street and 631 Filbert Street in Philadelphia for $4,266.67. [...] The next day, demolition of an abandoned whiskey distillery on the property began. Foundation work began on July 31, and by September 7, the first building was ready for installation of the <b>smelting</b> <b>furnace.</b> The smelt house was the first public building erected by the United States government.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{historically}} very rural, the Upland South {{was one of}} the nation's early industrial {{regions and}} continues to be today. Mining [...] of coal, iron, copper, and other minerals {{has been part of the}} region's economy since the 18th century. As early as 1750 lead and zinc were mined in Wythe County, Virginia, and copper was mined and smelted in Polk County, Tennessee. Two major Appalachian goldfields were developed, the first in western North Carolina beginning in 1799. By 1825 Rutherford County was the center of the nation's most extensive gold mining. In 1828 a much richer Gold Strike was made in north Georgia, mostly within what was then the territory of the Cherokee Nation. The mining camp of Dahlonega boomed during the ensuing Georgia Gold Rush. Iron foundries in Virginia and early coal mining operations in central Appalachia date to before 1850. Furnaces and forges were built in the Appalachians of North [...] Central Alabama as early as 1818 and by 1871 would give rise to Birmingham later known as the Pittsburgh of the South as it became the leading industrial and transportation hub of the south. Some of these early furnaces and forges were fueled with nearby deposits of bituminous coal. Similar examples of early urban-industrial areas include Embree's Iron Works in East Tennessee (1808), the Red River iron region of Estill County, Kentucky (1806-8), and the Jackson Iron Works near Morgantown, West Virginia (1830). Wheeling, West Virginia was known as [...] "Nail City" [...] in the 1840s and 1850s. By 1860 Tennessee was the third largest iron producing state in the nation, after Pennsylvania and New York. The scale of mining, especially coal mining, increased dramatically after 1870. The importance of mining and metallurgy can be seen in the many towns with names such as Pigeon Forge and Bloomery (a bloomery being a type of <b>smelting</b> <b>furnace),</b> scattered across the Upland South.|$|E

6000|$|When Mrs. Van Loo drove away, {{the manager}} {{returned}} with Demorest to the rooms. The marble hearth was smoked and discolored and still littered with charred ashes of burnt paper. [...] "My belief is," [...] said the manager darkly, [...] "that the old hag came {{here just to}} burn {{up a lot of}} incriminating papers that her son had intrusted to her keeping. It looks mighty suspicious. You see she got up an awful lot of side when I told her I didn't reckon to run a <b>smelting</b> <b>furnace</b> in a wooden hotel with the thermometer at one hundred in the office, and I reckon it was just an excuse for getting off in a hurry." ...|$|E
6000|$|This great chait is {{the largest}} in Sikkim; it is called [...] "Nirbogong," [...] {{and appears to be}} fully forty feet high; facing it is a stone altar about fifteen feet long and four broad, and behind this again is a very curious {{erection}} called [...] "Song-boom," [...] used for burning juniper as incense; it resembles a small <b>smelting</b> <b>furnace,</b> and consists of an elongated conical stone building eight feet high, raised on a single block; it is hollow, and divided into three stories or chambers; in the lower of which is a door, by which fuel is placed inside, and the smoke ascending through holes in the upper slabs, escapes by lateral openings from the top compartment. These structures are said to be common in Tibet, but I saw no other in Sikkim.|$|E
6000|$|And it is {{just the}} same with men's best wisdom. When you come to a good book, you must ask yourself, [...] "Am I {{inclined}} to work as an Australian miner would? Are my pickaxes and shovels in good order, and am I in good trim myself, my sleeves well up to the elbow, and my breath good, and my temper?" [...] And, keeping the figure a little longer, even at cost of tiresomeness, for it is a thoroughly useful one, the metal you are in search of being the author's mind or meaning, his words are as the rock which you have to crush and smelt in order to get at it. And your pickaxes are your own care, wit, and learning; your <b>smelting</b> <b>furnace</b> is your own thoughtful soul. Do not hope to get at any good author's meaning without those tools and that fire; often you will need sharpest, finest chiselling, and patientest fusing, before you can gather one grain of the metal.|$|E

50|$|At the KM3 site are mines, slag dumps, ore-processing areas, {{industrial}} refuse dumps, and <b>smelting</b> <b>furnaces.</b> <b>Smelting</b> <b>furnaces</b> were abundant, although recent farming {{practices in}} the core of the industrial site had disturbed some furnaces. The KM3 furnaces are more consistent in design and contents than the KM2 furnace pits. The furnace bowls are larger and more regular in size than the KM2 furnaces, with a mean diameter of 113.8 cm, ranging only from 112 to 116 cm. The mean depth of 28 cm among KM3 furnace pits is significantly greater than the mean depth of 18 cm at KM2, a difference attributable to the more complete preservation at KM3.|$|R
6000|$|On {{the left}} I passed a very curious {{isolated}} pillar of rock, amongst the wild crags to the north-east, whose bases we skirted: it resembles the Capuchin {{on the shoulder}} of Mont Blanc, as seen from the Jardin. Evening overtook us while still on the snow near the last ascent. As the sun declined, the snow at our feet reflected the most exquisitely delicate peach-bloom hue; and looking west {{from the top of the}} pass, the scenery was gorgeous beyond description, for the sun was just plunging into a sea of mist, amongst some cirrhi and stratus, all in a blaze of the ruddiest coppery hue. As it sank, the Nepal, peaks to the right assumed more definite, darker, and gigantic forms, and floods of light shot across the misty ocean, bathing the landscape around me in the most wonderful and indescribable changing tints. As the luminary was vanishing, the whole horizon glowed like copper run from a <b>smelting</b> <b>furnace,</b> and when it had quite disappeared, the little inequalities of the ragged edges of the mist were lighted up and shone like a row of volcanos in the far distance. I have never before or since seen anything, which for sublimity, beauty, and marvellous effects, could compare with what I gazed on that evening from Choonjerma pass. In some of Turner's pictures I have recognized similar effects, caught and fixed by a marvellous effort of genius; such are the fleeting hues over the ice, in his [...] "Whalers," [...] and the ruddy fire in his [...] "Wind, Steam, and Rain," [...] which one almost fears to touch. Dissolving views give some idea of the magic creation and dispersion of the effects, but any combination of science and art can no more recall the scene, than it can the feelings of awe that crept over me, during the hour I spent in solitude amongst these stupendous mountains.|$|E
