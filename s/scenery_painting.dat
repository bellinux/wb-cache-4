500|$|Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll {{is remembered}} above all for {{designing}} Thorvaldsens Museum. In 1822, {{as a young}} man, he had experienced Karl Friedrich Schinkel's classicism in Germany and France and had met the German-born architect and archaeologist Franz Gau who {{introduced him to the}} colourful architecture of antiquity. His uncle, Jonas Collin, who was an active art and culture official under Frederick VI, awakened the King's interest in a museum for Bertel Thorvaldsen, the Danish-Icelandic sculptor, and asked Bindesbøll to make some sketches for the building. As Bindensbøll's designs stood out from those of other architects, he was given a commission to transform the Royal Carriage Depot and Theatre <b>Scenery</b> <b>Painting</b> Building into a museum. Emulating the construction of the Erechtheion and the Parthenon as freestanding buildings released from the traditional urban plan of closed streets, he completed the work in 1848. He also incorporated aspects of ancient Egyptian architecture into his design, though [...] "the plan as a whole... is neither Egyptian nor Greek, but Bindesbøll's own." ...|$|E
6000|$|Farther: as {{the admiration}} of mankind is found, in our times, {{to have in}} great part passed from men to mountains, and from human emotion to natural phenomena, we may {{anticipate}} that the great strength of art will also be warped in this direction; with this notable result for us, that whereas the greatest painters or painter of classical and mediæval periods, being wholly devoted to the representation of humanity, furnished us with but little to examine in landscape, the greatest painters or painter of modern times will in all probability be devoted to landscape principally: and farther, because in representing human emotion words surpass painting, but in representing natural <b>scenery</b> <b>painting</b> surpasses words, we may anticipate also that the painter and poet (for convenience' sake I here use the words in opposition) will somewhat change their relations of rank in illustrating {{the mind of the}} age; that the painter will become of more importance, the poet of less; and that the relations between the men who are the types and firstfruits of the age in word and work,--namely, Scott and Turner,--will be, in many curious respects, different from those between Homer and Phidias, or Dante and Giotto.[119] ...|$|E

50|$|After Orson Welles's {{return from}} Europe, {{his friend and}} former {{headmaster}} Roger Hill invited him to join the Todd faculty and co-direct the Todd School's production of Twelfth Night. Using the edited version of the play that would appear in their book Everybody's Shakespeare (1934), Welles designed the costumes and conceived and created the set. The production made use of Kenneth Macgowan's concept of having the stage as a giant open book, with the turning pages being changes of <b>scenery,</b> <b>painted</b> by Welles himself.|$|R
50|$|Ottinger joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in 1858 {{after which}} he came to Utah Territory in 1861.

5000|$|Pepys' {{high praise}} for the theatre is often taken to reflect his {{excitement}} regarding London's burgeoning theatrical scene rather than as commentary than {{on the quality of}} the tennis-court theatre itself. John Styan says it [...] "seems a questionable statement about so makeshift a theatre." [...] Killigrew's competition, Davenant, would take another seven months to open his new theatre in nearby Lisle's Tennis Court; working more from the model of court masque venues such as Inigo Jones’ Cockpit-in-Court, he equipped it with a stage complete with a proscenium arch and moveable <b>scenery,</b> <b>painted</b> onto a series of sliding panels. Opening in late June, 1661, Davenant's theatre would steal much of Vere Street's thunder.|$|R

40|$|The {{concerns}} for theatrical decorative {{art of the}} MSSR arise mainly between {{the second half of}} the 1940 s and the late 1960 s. The study of the complex processes that develop in the first two postwar decades helps determining and outlining new directions and trends in theatrical art. The evolution of Moldovan art of <b>scenery</b> <b>painting</b> and creation of new directions in the theatrical decorative art is determined by the activity of renowned painters who carried out their professional activity in the most prestigious cultural centers of the country. Scenery painters Anatol Şubin, Konstantin Lodzeiski, Boris Sokolov, Anton Mater, Nicolai Alentiev, Boris Piskun and others belong to a group of painters that define the criteria and draw the paths for the development of the professional <b>scenery</b> <b>painting</b> in Moldova. They contributed to the diversification of the scenic language through various principles and forms of plastic expression, and to the increase of modalities of solving visual framework. Under the sign of seeking innovative forms of expressions and new means of space organization, the artists had to move along a complicated path. With the advent of painters with special training in <b>scenery</b> <b>painting,</b> the modern approach towards the creation of the visual image was acknowledged...|$|E
50|$|The {{end of the}} 19th century {{witnessed}} {{both the}} height {{and the end of}} <b>scenery</b> <b>painted</b> in traditional perspective. Scenic design was realistic and creative that released the audience’s imagination. Realism was but a passing style. Towards the end of the century, realism would find an opposite in naturalism. Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig would be the ones to revolt against the idea of the actor standing on a flat floor surrounded by “realistic” painted canvases. Their controversial ideas would be the basis of the New Stagecraft. The 20th century would bring the scenic designer an entirely new aesthetic for the world of the theatre in the form of Henrik Ibsen and Modernism. As movies replaced theatre’s popularity, an international aesthetic weighed in against <b>painted</b> <b>scenery,</b> scenic studios began to shrink, and scenic artists began to disappear. The golden age of scenic painting of the 19th century rapidly turned to a much more fragmented one in 20th century, as theatre styles changed radically and eventually the theatre lost popularity to movies and television.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT OF THE THESISExpanding HorizonsKim Hongdo's Album of the Four Districts of K&# 365;mgang and European Inspiration in Korean True <b>Scenery</b> <b>Painting</b> of the Eighteenth CenturyByNathaniel KingdonMasters of Arts in Art HistoryUniversity of California, Los Angeles, 2012 Professor Burglind Jungmann, Chair	The {{authenticity}} of the Album of the Four Districts of K&# 365;mgang attributed to Kim Hongdo (1745 -before 1818) is contested by scholars. Yi Song-mi argues that {{the style of the}} paintings correspond to a European sensibility that was not known in Korea in the late eighteenth century, whereas, Oh Ju-seok does not question the attribution to Kim Hongdo or the early dating of the album to ca. 1788. This debate contests Kim's progressive {{role in the development of}} the genre of true <b>scenery</b> <b>painting</b> as well as the extent to which Korean artists utilized European techniques and styles at the end of the eighteenth century. 	In order to understand whether Kim's painting is truly an anomaly, I examine the development of true <b>scenery</b> <b>painting</b> through two other major figures, Ch&# 335;ng S&# 335;n (1676 - 1759) and Kang Sehwang (1713 - 1776), with special attention as to the extent to which they integrate and expand on tradition. I also compare Kim's album with his set of eight hanging scrolls (ca. 1788) that contain similar techniques, styles, and calligraphic elements. My research indicates that both Ch&# 335;ng and Kang were keen innovators in the true-scenery genre, experimenting with many of the European techniques and styles that appear in the Four Districts album. In addition, Kim's set of eight hanging scrolls confirm that he used a similarly detailed style of painting for other commissions and that there may be calligraphic evidence to prove that the contested album is by his same hand. Although the true origin of the album may never be proven, my research indicates that it sits comfortably within the development of true-scenery painting in the eighteenth century as well as Kim's oeuvre of landscape works...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of Moldovan art of <b>scenery</b> <b>painting</b> {{and the emergence}} of new trends in theatre art is also determined by the activity {{of one of the most}} consecrated contemporary scenic artists – Boris Sokolov. Working as a scenery painter for over four decades, he contributed to the diversification of the theatrical plastic language through various principles and methods of expression. His works of the 1950 s– 1960 s stand out through the tendency of reflecting genuine motifs in the décor, with certain changes in the procedures of the means of expression. In the 1970 s– 1980 s, new tendencies arise in the scenic space designing. Consequently, we observe, in B. Sokolov’s creation, not so much the reproduction of the action’s place, but the expression of the action itself through the application of lighting effects and the diversity of used materials...|$|E
50|$|Le donne vendicate was {{commissioned}} by Cecilia Mahony Giustiniani, Princess of Bassano Romano, to be performed for Carnival in 1763. The publisher of the original score, Agostino Palombini, dedicated the printed libretto to her. The production was a critical success at its premiere with particular praise for the beautiful <b>scenery</b> <b>painted</b> by Sig. Giacomo Castellari, the elaborate costumes prepared by Giuseppe Griselli, the moving performances by the singers, {{and the beauty of}} the music. The opera ranks as one of the composer's more successful ventures, as witnessed by the large number of scores that survived in Austria, Germany, France, Poland, Italy and elsewhere. The exact date of the first performance is now unknown but it was sometime during Carnival in 1763. The two intermezzi tell one complete story and are meant to be performed together, in between acts of an opera seria.|$|R
