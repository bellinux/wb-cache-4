40|$|Abstract—As new {{challenges}} emerge in power electrical workplace safety, {{it is the}} responsibility of the systems designer to seek out new approaches and solutions that address them. Design decisions made today will impact cost, safety and serviceability of the installed systems for 40 or 50 years during the useful life for the owner. Studies have shown that this cost is an order of magnitude of 7 to 10 times the installed cost of the power distribution equipment.

40|$|An {{approach}} to probabilistic risk assessment of electrical system grounding is proposed. The method uses all significant {{factors that affect}} the risk of electrocution at substations and takes into account their probabilistic nature. The approach implements an accurate statistical description of IEC 479 - 1 fibrillation and body impedance data, and it uses detailed computer simulations of the modeled grounding system to provide <b>safety</b> <b>voltage</b> distributions that {{take into account the}} individual's presence at a site as a random variable. Variation in the power system fault level is accounted for, and extensive data of actual system fault clearance time are included. It is proposed that the probabilistic risk assessment is utilized as a second stage of the grounding system assessment when the first-stage deterministic analysis requires expensive or impractical mitigation. Implementation of the second stage probabilistic risk assessment yields a measure of individual risk. This is then benchmarked against industry-accepted “as low as reasonably practicable” values to determine whether investment in mitigation is required. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach, the probabilistic risk assessment is applied to a practical case study of a transmission substation...|$|E

The behaviour of the impulse resistance of the tower footings under highmagnitude impulse currents was investigated. The non-linear characteristics of the impulse resistance with peak current are demonstrated for the entire tower base and for single tower footings.

40|$|The safety {{criteria}} {{of national and}} international grounding standards do not compare well due {{to a variety of}} adopted values for permissible <b>safety</b> <b>voltages.</b> These differences stem from disparities in assumed worst-case conditions which result from the adoption of discrete probabilistic assumptions of safety parameters embedded within an overall deterministic safety assessment. Harmonization of grounding design standards, however, could be achieved through the adoption of a probabilistic safety assessment which will lead to a quantification of the risk of ventricular fibrillation to an individual. Fundamental principles and criteria for such an approach are developed in this paper, and are based on a statistical analysis of the IEC published curves of ventricular fibrillation. The developed numerical approach also takes into account the effect of current path on fibrillation sensitivity and body impedance. Using this approach, probability surfaces of ventricular fibrillation are then calculated as a function of applied voltage and shock duration. This statistical approach to the characterization of the human body under various electric shock scenarios forms a platform for a full probabilistic approach which can be extended to take into account other statistical parameters, and may lead to a more objective measure for making investment decisions in hazard mitigation...|$|R

We also present the implementation details and silicon measurements results of a 64 -bit processor fabricated in 0. 18 - m technology that uses Razor for supply voltage control. Traditional DVS techniques require significant <b>voltage</b> <b>safety</b> margins to guar-antee computational correctness at the worst case combination of process, voltage and temperature conditions, leading to a loss in energy efficiency. In Razor-based DVS, however, the supply voltage is automatically reduced {{to the point of}} first failure using the error detection and correction mechanism, thereby eliminating safety margins while still ensuring correct operation. In addition, the supply voltage can be intentionally scaled below the point of first failure of the processor to achieve an optimal tradeoff between energy savings from further voltage reduction and energy overhead from increased error detection and correction activity. We tested and measured savings due to Razor DVS for 33 different dies and obtained an average energy savings of 50 % over worst case operating conditions by scaling supply voltage to achieve a 0. 1 % targeted error rate, at a fixed frequency of 120 MHz.

40|$|Earthing {{systems are}} {{designed}} to perform satisfactorily under normal system voltage conditions as well as power frequency faults. The performance of most earth electrode geometries is now fairly well understood under these conditions. However, the response of earthing systems under high frequency and transient conditions {{is yet to be}} fully clarified, and there are several aspects of earthing systems that require further investigations. In this thesis, both modelling and experimental studies were carried out using high frequency and impulse current injection. Generic earth electrodes as well as the full earthing grid of an operating substation were investigated. The studies carried out in this work have confirmed some of the previous findings published in the open literature, and have clarified some aspects of conduction in earthing systems. The literature review on injuries due to lightning currents has highlighted the importance of good earthing systems. A comprehensive parametric simulation study was conducted on vertical rods, horizontal electrodes as well as earth grids under variable frequency and impulse currents. The effects of geometry and soil characteristics were also studied. It was demonstrated that significant inductive effects appear at high frequency, {{and the size of the}} earthing systems was found to reach an 'effective dimension' beyond which negligible performance benefit is obtained. For horizontal electrodes the concept of effective length is investigated and for grids the effective area was used instead. The Simulation techniques developed for these simple electrodes were applied to an operating transmission substation, and similar trends were seen under high frequency and impulse current conditions. The <b>safety</b> <b>voltages</b> were calculated but no conclusion could be drawn as there are no recommended safety guidelines for safety at high frequency and impulse current. These Generic studies have led to a new proposal for earthing systems so that the short fall of poor performance due to inductive effects and 'effective dimensions' are minimized. It was shown that this proposal is a major improvement on the existing enhancement techniques currently used in practice. Parallel to the simulation programme, an experimental set up was used to study the performance of laboratory earth electrode models under fast impulse current. It was found that highly non-linear conduction phenomena take place in such configurations. These complex conduction processes were explained by thermal effects and soil ionisation...|$|R
