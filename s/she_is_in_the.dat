5|$|The {{script was}} {{originally}} too long, {{and as a}} result many sequences had to be cut, some even after they had been filmed.

Whithouse thought this would be a relatively easy stunt, but was told it would be too hard to accomplish and Whithouse revised it to when Francesco simply runs away. When discussing the script with Whithouse, Helen McCrory, who portrayed Rosanna, thought that she should hurt Amy at some point and it was added that she bites Amy while <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chamber.|$|E

25|$|Calendar-based methods use {{records of}} past menstrual cycles {{to predict the}} length of future cycles. However, {{the length of the}} pre-ovulatory phase can vary significantly, {{depending}} on the woman's typical cycle length, stress factors, medication, illness, menopause, breastfeeding, and whether she is just coming off hormonal contraception. If a woman with previously regular cycles has a delayed ovulation due to one of these factors, she will still be fertile when the method tells her <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> post-ovulatory infertile phase. If she has an unusually early ovulation, calendar-based methods will indicate she is still in the pre-ovulatory infertile phase when she has actually become fertile.|$|E
