5|$|All {{specimens}} {{from the}} NKMNP were caught {{above the ground}} in vegetation, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> species is arboreal like {{the other members of}} its genus. The chigger Eutrombicula batatas has been found on O.sydandersoni. Nothing else is known about ecology, behavior, diet, reproduction, or conservation status.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{vestiges of}} a foundry {{were found in}} a smaller cave near the Nahr al-Kalb river, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cave was used in antiquity to produce swords.|$|E
5|$|Burnley: In 1856, Burnley Grammar School {{master and}} antiquary Thomas T. Wilkinson {{published}} a paper <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> battle {{occurred on the}} moors above Burnley, noting that the town stands on the River Brun.

50|$|Several {{studies have}} <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> family Ascoviridae {{evolved from the}} Iridoviridae. A study of <b>the</b> Iridoviruses <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Iridoviridae, Ascoviridae and Marseilleviridaeare are related with Ascoviruses most closely related to Iridoviruses.|$|R
5000|$|John Koch <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} form of Imanuentius's name {{may have been}} *Mannuētios. He also <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Welsh mythological figure Manawydan may derive from an earlier *Mannuētiagnos, [...] "son of Mannuetios".|$|R
50|$|Some studies <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> average brain size {{has been}} {{decreasing}} {{over the past}} 28,000 years. Others <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cranial capacity for males is unchanged, but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cranial capacity of females has increased.|$|R
5|$|Furthermore, {{there has}} been {{research}} <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> common raven is involved in seed dispersal. In the wild, the common raven chooses the best habitat and disperses seeds in locations best suited for its survival.|$|E
5|$|Studies are <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{impact of}} refined {{carbohydrates}} or high glycemic load carbohydrates are {{more significant than}} the impact of saturated fatty acids on cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{clips from}} The Underwater Menace, episode 2 were later found to {{precisely}} match the edits {{to the print}} discovered in late 2011, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> recovered episode was exactly the same print that had been censored decades before.|$|E
5000|$|Although Haswell-Smith <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{name means}} [...] "yew island", the {{preponderance}} of Norse names in <b>the</b> Outer Hebrides <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> second element of [...] "Iubhard" [...] may be a corruption of fjord/firth.|$|R
50|$|Although {{some have}} <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{editor of the}} text is Tertullian, the editor’s {{identity}} remains uncertain. The writing style {{and content of the}} edited material do seem to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> editor is male.|$|R

5|$|Three {{stone tools}} {{dating from the}} Neolithic era were discovered, but no other {{evidence}} of a Stone Age settlement in Ashdod was found, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tools were deposited there in a later period.|$|E
3000|$|This fact {{therefore}} <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{grain size}} and the Nd coating have an independent influence on the coercivity, since the AFM images shown in Fig. 3 <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> average Nd-Fe-B grain size D_NFB^AFM decreases with decreasing t [...]...|$|R
5000|$|Some authors reject {{both the}} French and Goidelic theories, and instead <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{ultimate}} source {{both for the}} Norman French, Scots, and Goidelic variants of this word have a common Norse root.

25|$|<b>The</b> second {{equation}} <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Strouhal {{number is}} a weak negative function of Reynolds number. This <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dynamic similarity approximation is reasonable. The fluctuating force exerted on the cylinder {{is a result}} of the flow circulation around it caused by the alternate vortex separation as suggested in the third figure. <b>The</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> vortices are not directly behind <b>the</b> cylinder <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> force vector has both a lift and drag component resulting in lift and drag dipoles.|$|R
5|$|With {{the arrival}} of the year 2012, Nostradamus's prophecies started to be co-opted (especially by the History Channel) as {{evidence}} <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> end of the world was imminent, notwithstanding the fact that his book never mentions the end of the world, let alone the year 2012.|$|E
5|$|A higher {{percentage}} of female workers of the bee species Apis cerana are reported to activate their ovaries than those of Apis mellifera or Apis florea. When queens were removed, up to 40% of the workers activated their ovaries in subsequent days. However, policing workers continued to eat the worker-laid eggs, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mechanism of policing in this species does not involve direct intervention from the queen.|$|E
5|$|Although all {{the colossal}} heads are broadly similar, there are {{distinct}} stylistic {{differences in their}} execution. One of the heads from San Lorenzo bears traces of plaster and red paint, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> heads were originally brightly decorated. Heads did not just represent individual Olmec rulers; they also incorporated {{the very concept of}} rulership itself.|$|E
50|$|It {{has also}} been <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> riots were sparked by an anti-Zionist speech by Sultan Mohammed V {{relating}} to the ongoing 1948 Arab-Israeli War, although others <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Sultan's speech was focused on ensuring {{the protection of the}} Moroccan Jews.|$|R
5000|$|... <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> genetic {{distance}} between Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe is anomalously {{lower than it}} would be if the two populations had been evolving independently. <b>The</b> study <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lower {{genetic distance}} between Europe and Africa can be explained by genetic admixture.|$|R
50|$|Endovelicus also {{protected}} the cities or region <b>that</b> venerated him. <b>The</b> epithets given to Endovelicus are deus ‘god’, sanctus ‘holy’, and praestantissimus ‘most outstanding’. These <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> god was effective, and always present and {{living on the}} sanctuary. Votive altars <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> god inspired the early Lusitanian resistance against the Romans. <b>The</b> epithets also <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> he was <b>the</b> chief deity of his pantheon.|$|R
5|$|Although use of {{the local}} Ocosito-style {{ceramics}} continued, there was a marked intrusion of K'iche' ceramics from the highlands in the Postclassic period, concentrated particularly {{in the northern part}} of the site but extending to cover the whole. The indigenous accounts of the K'iche' themselves claim that they conquered this region of the Pacific coast, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> presence of their ceramics is associated with their conquest of Takalik Abaj.|$|E
5|$|An 1891 Ordnance Survey {{map shows}} that the arm on the Rochdale Canal had been filled in and the complex's canal basin had been retitled as a reservoir, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> canal had ceased {{to be used as}} a way of {{transporting}} goods to and from the complex. By 1902, the canal basin had been filled in, however exactly when it was filled in is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of mtDNA {{sequences}} {{has confirmed}} morphological and biogeographical studies <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> razorbill {{is the closest}} living relative of the great auk. The great auk also was related closely to the little auk (dovekie), which underwent a radically different evolution compared to Pinguinus. Due to its outward similarity to the razorbill (apart from flightlessness and size), the great auk often {{was placed in the}} genus Alca, following Linnaeus.|$|E
50|$|Fossil {{evidence}} <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> nyala {{has been}} a separate species {{since the end of}} the Miocene (5.8 million years ago). Genetic evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> proto-nyala had some early hybridization with the proto-lesser kudu, but the two have remained separate long after this crossing.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, in {{a letter}} to the British medical journal The Lancet, it was <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> French Revolution leader Maximilien Robespierre had sarcoidosis, and <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{condition}} caused him a notable impairment during his time as the head of the Reign of Terror.|$|R
5000|$|In recent scholarship, it {{has been}} <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{attribution}} to Hippolytus and <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Apostolic Tradition is a composite work modified over the centuries. According to this view, the anaphora probably attained its final form around {{the middle of the}} 4th century and is not related to Rome but to West Syria or even to Egypt. Some scholars also <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Apostolic Tradition portrays a liturgy that was never celebrated. [...] However, in Eastern Orthodox ecclesiology, the attribution to Hippolytus remains generally accepted.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the paucity}} of {{surviving}} attributed works, {{it is difficult to}} detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> more advanced Presentation in the Temple is of 1445, predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of Islam, Afghanistan had close {{cultural}} ties with India, and the adoration of both Hindu and Buddhist deities was practiced. Examples of sculptures from the 5th to the 7th centuries have survived, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> worship of Ganesha was then in vogue in the region.|$|E
5|$|British {{aircraft}} received fighter {{control from}} warships in San Carlos Water, although its effectiveness was limited by their being stationed {{close to the}} islands, which severely limited {{the effectiveness of their}} radar. The differences in tactics and training between 800 Squadron and 801 Squadron has been a point of criticism, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> losses of several ships were preventable had Sea Harriers from Hermes been used more effectively.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Marshall <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> court's opinion goes a {{step further}} than the Carroll v.
