The Ostpolitik of German chancellor Willy Brandt lead to the recognition of East Germany.Cooperation on the Helsinki Accords led to several agreements on politics, economics and human rights. A series of arms control agreements such as SALT I and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty were created to limit the development of strategic weapons and slow the arms race.

40|$|Established in 1952, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) {{is one of}} the world's premier applied-science {{national}} security laboratories. The primary mission of the Laboratory is to assure through the design, development, and stewardship <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> that the nation's stockpile remains safe, secure, and reliable and to prevent the <b>spread</b> and use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> worldwide. National security is a principal integrating theme at LLNL [...] with stockpile stewardship, nonproliferation and arms control, and Department of Defense projects its major elements. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, the primary Laboratory program, is a science-based versus testing-based approach to maintaining stockpile safety and reliability. The idea is to replace <b>weapons</b> development and <b>nuclear</b> testing with <b>weapons</b> life extension and intensive computational and experimental research to provide the fundamental understanding necessary to ensure <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> safety, performance, and maintenance. Stockpile stewardship is enhanced and complimented by a second pillar of {{national security}} at the Laboratory: countering the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> weapons of mass destruction. In the broad areas comprising nonproliferation, arms control, and international assessments, the growth of new technologies has been exponential at LLNL. Our ability to produce advanced microsensors [...] from scientific concept to working field model [...] {{is just one of the}} many contributions LLNL has made to the nation in counter proliferation against nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. In addition, LLNL's unique competencies developed in support of its national security mission have become an important resource for U. S. industry and government. Programs include advanced defense technologies, energy, environment, biosciences, and the basic sciences. Central to the Laboratory's success is its diverse, highly talented, and skilled workforce and its $ 4 billion capital invested in plant and research facilities. The University of California (UC) has managed the Laboratory since its inception, under contract with the DOE and its predecessors...|$|R

LLNL's programs in advanced technologies, energy, environment, biosciences, and basic science apply LLNL's unique capabilities and enhance the competencies needed for this national security mission. LLNL's mission also involves working with industrial and academic partners to increase national competitiveness and improve science education. LLNL's mission is dynamic and has changed over the years to meet new national needs. In keeping with the Laboratory's mission, the environment, safety, and health (ES&H) have top priority.

40|$|CO 926, {{the main}} series of volumes {{containing}} the Colonial and Commonwealth Relations Offices’ original correspondence and papers, including Maltese affairs, between 1961 and 1964, were recently released in London. Professor Frendo {{is the first}} to see and to study these for a book from original sources (including the British intelligence reports) about how Malta really became independent. This has, as a backdrop, decolonization in the British Empire, Europe and the Mediterranean. Professor Frendo’s findings and analysis bring into the o[pen many so fat unknown facts, throwing new light on how and why the onetime fortress colony of Malta became independent from the British in 1964, who and what made it happen when it did. The Origins of Maltese Statehood thus offers new, engaging facts and insights on what for Malta and her people was, in the author’s words, “a parting of the way, a stepping out in to the world”. Henry Frendo shows how Malta’s emergence to statehood in the early 1960 s was all the more remarkable given the growing unrest in Cyprus, Libya and Aden, as well as the strained relations between East and West {{in the wake of the}} Cuba missile crisis, President Kennedy’s assassination, Soviet influence in Southern Europe including a naval presence in the Mediterranean, and the <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> Malta’s role in NATO (the Mediterranean forces of which she then headquartered), the possibility of her membership of the organization, and her part in evolving British and American strategy in the Mediterranean, are considered. So is a secret plan in 1963 for Malta’s integration with Italy after Independence. The book contains substantial biographical information, some of it novel and startling, on leading personalities including Dr Borg Olivier, MR Mintoff, Archbishop Gonzi and Police Commisioner De Gray (all of whom the author had also interviewed in the past) leading to the transfer of power in September 1964 – when, the book shows, there could have been a bloodbath. As much a history of Malta as of Sir Alec Douglas-Home’s Britain in some respect, this story has the colonial and defence secretaries Duncan Sandys and Peter Thorneycroft as well as the Defence Chief, Earl Mountbatten of Burma, in pivotal roles. Here is a case study of the path to statehood of a former outpost of Empire, a key operational station at least until the 1956 Suez crisis, as well as a long-standing bastion of Christendom straddling in the North-South divide. Malta’s independence story unfolds in the related contexts of an unfolding Commonwealth, with its attendant challenges and perils; an increasingly exposed Southern flank; and the movement towards European integration. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Of {{the roughly}} two dozen {{countries}} that have pursued or obtained <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> during the last fifty years, {{almost all of them}} depended importantly on foreign supplies. As a short term projection over the next five to ten years, illicit nuclear trade is likely to be conducted by several nations seeking <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> or wanting to maintain existing <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> arsenals or capabilities. Additional states in regions of proliferation concern may utilize smuggling methods to acquire advanced, ostensibly civilian, nuclear technology including uranium enrichment and plutonium production and separation capabilities. And despite many recent, particularly United States-led, successes, stopping this trade will remain difficult. Absent mitigating actions, several existing or expected trends are projected {{to make it easier for}} smugglers to succeed in acquiring nuclear and nuclear-related goods and technology. Future illicit trade can be stopped through measures taken today as long as the political will is there to foresee and address future threats. A range of countermeasures aimed at mitigating or eliminating these future threats must be employed today to stop them from emerging in the next five to ten years.
