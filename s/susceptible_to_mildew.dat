50|$|Hibernal was {{developed}} {{for the same reasons}} as other new varieties developed by the Geisenheim Institute, such as Ehrenbreitsteiner, Dakapo, Rondo and Saphira. The basic idea was to develop pest and fungus-resistant vines. In bad years Hibernal is <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>mildew</b> (powdery mildew and downy mildew) and must be provided with 1-2 sulphur treatments shortly before and/or shortly after flowering. The variety, however, has a very good winter hardiness even against stronger frosts.|$|E
40|$|Powdery mildew and root-knot {{nematode}} {{are very}} important diseases occurred in cucurbits. This study wasconducted to evaluate the resistance of commercial cucurbit cultivars (21 cultivars of cucumber, 9 cultivars ofwatermelon, 7 cultivars of oriental melon, and 2 cultivars of melon) <b>to</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> and root-knotnematode. At 60 days after transplanting, disease severity of powdery mildew of commercial cucurbitcultivars was investigated. Two cucumber cultivars, ‘Gangryeogsamcheok’ and ‘Sunhobaegchimdadagi’were moderately resistant {{but the rest of}} cucumber cultivars were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> powdery <b>mildew.</b> Allexamined watermelon and oriental melon cultivars were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> powdery <b>mildew,</b> while two meloncultivars (‘PMR Turbo’ and ‘PMR Victory’) were resistant.

5000|$|It {{is a rich}} {{flowering}} rose, with a {{very compact}} habit. Under normal conditions it reaches a height of 40 to 50 cm. The flowers can reach a size of up to 9 cm, are strong and have filled up to 40 petals. The flower color is predominantly Violet. They distribute an intensive intoxicating fragrance. The deciduous leaves of rose have green and rich foliage. This rose is easily <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>mildew</b> and Diplocarpon rosae. Therefore, it needs regular maintenance.|$|E
50|$|Heavy {{nitrogen}} composting must {{be avoided}} as too much nitrogen will produce extensive growth and weaken the bush. This {{will make the}} bush <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>mildew.</b> The fruit should best be picked off when large to reach maximum sweetness. Supermarkets tend to have theirs picked early and before they are ripe and sweet to give a long shelf life. Heavily laden branches should be cut off complete with berries, this really benefits future crops as it lets the light reach the new growth.Cultivar 'Invicta' now is a popular green gooseberry which has some mildew resistance.|$|E
50|$|Only a few pests {{are known}} to cause severe damage in carob orchards, so they have {{traditionally}} not been treated with pesticides. Some generalist pests such as the larvae of the leopard moth (Zeuzera pyrina L.), small rodents such as rats (Rattus spp.) and gophers (Pitymys spp.) can cause damage occasionally in some regions. Only some cultivars are severely <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>mildew</b> disease (Oidium ceratoniae C.). One pest directly associated with carob is the larva of the carob moth (Myelois ceratoniae Z.), which can cause extensive postharvest damage.|$|E

40|$|Powdery mildew {{of linseed}} caused by Oidium lini Skoric is {{important}} next to rust. Most of the rust resis-tant cvs. of linseed are highly <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> powdery <b>mildew.</b> When powdery mildew appears in severe form {{at an early}} stage of crop growth, yield reduction is very high. Infected plants produce poor quality seed and fibre. Initially, disease appears in form of small, circular or irregular, dirty, white powdery patches on few leaves of the plant. Soon it spreads to cover the entire plant including leaves, stem, branches, flowers and capsules. The present study was aimed at investigating inherit-ance of resistance in F 2 seedlings of crosses made be-tween resistant x resistant and resistant x <b>susceptible</b> parents <b>to</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> pathogen of linseed. Reaction of F 2 plants from crosses made between parents resistant (R) x resistant (R), and resistant (R) x <b>susceptible</b> (S) <b>to</b> Oidium lini were recorded under artificial inoculation conditions (3) by counting the number of plants resistant and <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> powdery <b>mildew.</b> Segregation pattern in F 2 population of crosses was determined through X 2 test. Reaction of F 2 seedlings of crosses between resis-tant and resistant and between resistant and <b>susceptible</b> parents <b>to</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> pathogen of linseed indi-cated that resistance in all the cases is governed by dominant genes and virulence is a recessive character (Table 1, 2). The resistance in LCK- 8776, RL- 33 - 4, RL- 49 - 4 - 8 - 2 and DPL- 20 is conditioned by single domi-nant gene whereas resistance in RL-SO- 3 and Flake-l was controlled by two dominant genes as indicated by their segregation pattern of 3 R: 1 S and lSR: 1 S, re-spectively.

Some of its seedlings are {{from the beginning of}} the 20th century are 'Rose Marie Viaud' (Igoult, 1924), 'Violette' (Turbat, 1921), 'Schloß Friedenstein' (Schmidt, 1915), and 'Mosel' (Lambert, 1920).|$|E
50|$|The chardonnay variety {{constitutes}} the white wines of the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC). Its bunches are relatively small, cylindrical, less dense {{than those of}} the Pinot noir, and consist of irregular, rather small, golden yellow grapes. Like the Pinot noir, from maturation of the first stage like the Pinot noir, it adapts better to the humidity {{of the end of the}} season with a better resistance against rotting unless undergoing vigorous growth. It is <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>mildew</b> and the flavescence dorée bacterial disease. It buds just before the Pinot noir, which also makes it sensitive to spring frosts. The sugar contents of the berries can achieve high levels while retaining a significant acidity, which allows for wines to be particularly well balanced, powerful, detailed, and ropy, with lots of volume.|$|E
40|$|Phenological {{studies on}} three morphologically {{distinct}} accessions of physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.) {{were conducted in}} the Brazilian Savannah biome. Plant growth rate, flowering, fruit formation and development were measured {{in order to establish}} appropriate management practices for increasing productivity. The accessions CNPAE- 102 (toxic and <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> powdery <b>mildew),</b> CNPAE- 169 (non-toxic and <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> powdery <b>mildew)</b> and CNPAE- 259 (toxic and resistant <b>to</b> powdery <b>mildew)</b> were studied. Accessions with undetectable levels of phorbol ester in the grains were considered as non-toxic. The agronomic variables (plant height, number of inflorescences, number of green and ripe fruits per plant) from each accession were measured biweekly during one year (August 2009 to July 2010), correlating them with climatic variables using the Pearson's correlation analysis. CNPAE- 102 showed the highest growth rate (0. 76 cm day- 1), with 1. 10 m increment in height and final height of 2. 60 m. CNPAE- 169 showed the lowest growth rate (0. 63 cm day- 1) with final mean height of 1. 85 m. CNPAE- 102 and CNPAE- 259 showed early cycle and CNPAE- 169, late cycle. The minimum temperature was the climatic variable that determined the most inflorescences...|$|R
5000|$|Most plant based insulations such as wood chips, wood fiber, sawdust, redwood bark, hemlock fiber, balsa wood, hemp fiber, flax fiber, etc. are hygroscopic.

If not trained when still flexible, they crawl on the ground into all directions. Albèric Barbier is a robust plant, useful for covering fences or unsightly walls, even those faced northwards, as it is shade tolerant. It can also grow in full sun, but doesnt prosper in hot spots or harsher climates. In mild regions, the cultivar is semi-evergreen, as the leaves remain long on the plant.
