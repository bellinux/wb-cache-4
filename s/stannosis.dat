40|$|<b>Stannosis</b> {{is a rare}} non-fibrotic {{pneumoconiosis}} {{that follows}} chronic inhalation of tin particles. Apart from occupational history and radiographic findings, no diagnostic criteria exist for <b>stannosis.</b> Therefore, analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) to support <b>stannosis</b> might be of significant value. The case of a 74 -yr male patient, who developed progressive dyspnea and dry cough 35 years after full-time working as a tinner for 17 years, is reported. His post-bronchodilator FVC and FEV 1 were 111 % and 108 % predicted, respectively, accompanied by disproportionately low DLCO (34. 4 % predicted). Contents of tin, lead and copper were measured in both BALF and peripheral blood by electrothermal atomic and flame absorption spectrometry. The patient had 38. 5 -, 48. 5 -, 88 - and 85 -fold higher BALF concentration of tin than did four male individuals without <b>stannosis</b> or an exposure to other heavy metals (crude figures and standardized for total protein, albumin, and potassium contents, respectively). No differences between {{the patient and the}} controls were present for BALF concentrations of lead and copper, neither there were differences for any of the heavy metals in peripheral blood. The relative coefficient of excretion of 24. 9 for tin in the patient and of &lt; 1 both for tin in the controls and for other metals in the patient, as well as for all metals in the controls refers to the deposition of tin locally into the lungs of the patient via chronic inhalation. This case study indicates that weighed measurement of tin in BALF could provide significant support to the clinical diagnosis of <b>stannosis...</b>|$|E
30|$|High-attenuation {{pulmonary}} abnormalities {{can result}} {{from a variety of}} different conditions, including from the deposition of calcium. Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity may cause high-attenuation pulmonary parenchymal opacities. Multiple dense nodular opacities are rarely seen in siderosis, <b>stannosis,</b> talcosis and baritosis, in which iron, tin, talc and barium sulfate respectively are deposited in the lungs. Computed tomography (CT) is highly sensitive in the detection of areas of abnormally high attenuation in the lung parenchyma, airways, mediastinum and pleura. Calcifications in the thorax are frequently manifestations of previous infectious processes. However, they may be due to benign or malign neoplasms, metabolic disorders, or occupational exposure. The cause of the calcifications and other high-attenuation conditions may be determined by means of the location and pattern of the abnormalities within the lung parenchyma and knowledge of the associated clinical features. High-attenuation pulmonary abnormalities can be divided into five main patterns on CT: small hyperdense nodules, large nodules or masses, high-attenuation linear or reticular pattern, high-attenuation consolidation, and high-attenuation extraparenchymal lesions.|$|E
