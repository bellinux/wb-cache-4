40|$|In late 1997, the EU Commission {{reviewed}} its Transit Agreement with Austria, {{concluding that}} the ecopoints systems was an effective means to reduce pollution caused by lorries driving through Austria. Yet heavy transport frequencies continued {{to grow in the}} sensitive Alpine valleys, the result of the carriers' practice of rerouting transports {{to get the most out}} of their quota <b>of</b> <b>ecopoints</b> and the increased use of ECMT permits. And in spite <b>of</b> the <b>ecopoints</b> scheme, carriers did not always use state-of-the art "environmentally friendly" lorries. Carriers from Greece, the U. K. and Ireland in particular appeared to have sufficient ecopoints at their disposal to use their obsolete, highly polluting lorries for Alpine transports, putting an undue burden on the environment. Before expiry of the Transit Agreement, i. e., by 2003 at the latest, proposals are to be developed to achieve a sustainable solution to the transit problem. Transports through sensitive regions could be subject to road-pricing to reflect the external costs produced by them. All of the lorry transport in these zones, including spot, source and destination traffic, is to be governed by limits for noise and pollutant emissions which are to be set as low as possible. In addition, noise barriers, speed limits and a ban on night driving are to reduce the environmental burden. Nevertheless efforts need to be made to reduce pollution from passenger cars as well in order to achieve a fundamental improvement in the living conditions of the Alpine valleys suffering from transit traffic.

40|$|Replacement {{of fossil}} fuels by more {{sustainable}} fuels such as biofuels has become increasingly important during the last decade. This is mainly due to economical and environmental reasons. This thesis describes a study, both theoretical and experimental, of the fundamentals of superheated steam drying of biofuels and an investigation <b>of</b> biofuel <b>systems</b> where a super heated steam dryer is integrated with heat and power production. The fundamental studies show {{that it is possible}} and enlightening to describe the equilibrium moisture content of wood in moist air and in superheated steam in an analogous way. The equilibrium moisture content depends on the activity of the superheated steam, the temperature and the material. The experimental results show that the release of organic compounds depends on the temperature of the superheated steam, the drying time and the age of the chips. The formation rate is strongly dependent on temperature. It has been shown that life cycle assessment (LCA) is a valuable tool in comparing different alternatives for heat and power production and for environmental optimisation <b>of</b> biofuel <b>systems.</b> Different evaluation methods show that Case 2 (dried biofuel) is an improvement over Case 1 (wet biofuel and coal). Of major importance is the large reduction of fossil CO 2 of Case 2 compared to Case 1. The environmental impact of the organic compounds from the exhaust gas during the drying is estimated to be small. In this study a new approach to dynamic situations is taken where the environmental impact is expressed as cumulative formation <b>of</b> <b>ecopoints</b> (or equivalent). Drying until the limit at a low temperature (until the constant rate is ended) is preferred. The economical optimum is different from the environmental optimum. Pareto-curves may support the decision making process when combined economic and environmental optima are required...|$|R
