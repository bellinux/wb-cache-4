5000|$|Air Ministry, 5 August 1941The KING {{has been}} graciously pleased to confer the VICTORIA CROSS on the undermentioned non-commissioned officer in {{recognition}} of most conspicuous bravery :-NZ401793 Sergeant Pilot James Allen WardOn the night of 7 July 1941, Sergeant Ward was second pilot of a Wellington bomber returning from an attack on Munster. While flying over the Zuider Zee at 13,000 feet his aircraft was attacked from beneath by a German ME110, which secured hits with cannon-shell and incendiary bullets. The rear gunner {{was wounded in the}} foot but delivered a burst of fire sending the enemy fighter down, apparently out of control. Fire then broke out in the Wellington's near-starboard engine and, fed by petrol from a <b>split</b> <b>pipe,</b> quickly gained an alarming hold and threatened to spread to the entire wing. The crew forced a hole in the fuselage and made strenuous efforts to reduce the fire with extinguishers, and even coffee from their flasks, without success. They were then warned to be ready to abandon the aircraft. As a last resort Sergeant Ward volunteered to make an attempt to smother the fire with an engine cover which happened to be in use as a cushion. At first he proposed discarding his parachute to reduce wind resistance, but was finally persuaded to take it. A rope from the aircraft dingy was tied to him, though this was of little help and might have become a danger had he been blown off the aircraft.With the help of his navigator he then climbed through the narrow astrodome and put on his parachute. The bomber was flying at a reduced speed but the wind pressure must have been sufficient to render the operation one of extreme difficulty. Breaking the fabric to make hand and foot holds where necessary and also taking advantage of existing holes in the fabric, Sergeant Ward succeeded in descending three feet to the wing and proceeding another three feet to a position behind the engine, despite the slipstream from the airscrew which nearly blew him off the wing. Lying in this precarious position he smothered the fire in the wing fabric and tried to push the engine cover into the hole in the wing and on the leaking pipe from which the fire came. As soon as he had removed his hand, however, a terrific wind blew the cover out and when he tried again it was lost. Tired as he was, he was able, with the navigator's assistance, to make a successful but perilous journey back into the aircraft. There was now no danger of fire spreading from the petrol pipe as there was no fabric left near it and in due course it burned itself out. When the aircraft was nearly home, some petrol which had collected in the wing blazed up furiously but died down quite suddenly. A safe landing was made despite the damage sustained to the aircraft. The flight home had been made possible by the gallantry of Sergeant Ward in extinguishing the fire on the wing in circumstances of the greatest difficulty and at the risk of his life.|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{a research}} investigation on connection details and bracing layouts for stability bracing of steel bridges with skewed supports. Cross-frames and diaphragms {{play an important}} role in stabilizing steel girders, particularly during construction. The commonly used bent plate connection between skewed braces and steel girders can introduce flexibility that can have detrimental effects on the bracing behavior. An alternative detail investigated in this study is a <b>split</b> <b>pipe</b> stiffener used to connect cross-frames to girders at a skew. The <b>split</b> <b>pipe</b> stiffener allows perpendicular connections to the cross-frame connection tab, regardless of the skew angle. The <b>split</b> <b>pipe</b> provides a stiffer connection between the cross-frame and the girder. More importantly, the <b>split</b> <b>pipe</b> stiffener increases the torsional stiffness of the girder by introducing substantial warping restraint. This increases the lateral torsional buckling capacity of the girder and allows the first line of intermediate cross-frames to be moved farther from the support. Overall, the increase in girder torsional stiffness and buckling capacity that results from the use of the <b>split</b> <b>pipe</b> stiffener will enhance the safety of the girder at all stages of construction: during transportation, lifting, erection, and placement of the concrete deck. This study also examined layout patterns for intermediate cross-frame...|$|E
40|$|The project ”Investment {{proposal}} for grinding station for service work of screw feeders” has been performed {{during the spring}} semester 2014 for the course Bachelor’s thesis for degree of  Bachelor of science in machine engineering at Karlstad’s University. The project has been performed in cooperation with Fiber Workshop which is a service department in the company Valmet AB. Valmet AB {{is a company that}} develops and manufacture soft paper tissue machines. The screw feeder is a part that is used to feed, and squeeze out the water out of woodchips. The service work of the screw feeder mostly consists of service work on two major parts, namely the feeder screw and the <b>split</b> <b>pipe,</b> which the feeder screw is mounted in.   The purpose of the project was to evaluate the service work, namely the grinding in a working environment point of view. Another goal of the project was to present some improvements for this process.   The working environment which has been evaluated is primarily the risk of vibration damage in arm and hand, the risk of ergonomic musculoskeletal disorders and even a dust measurement has been performed, with the help of Hans-Olov Karlsson from the company Clarahälsan. The result from the working environment survey suggests that the operator exceed the work environment limits in regards to the risk of suffering damages from vibrations in the hand and arm. The grinding work of the <b>split</b> <b>pipe</b> {{is considered to be a}} bigger problem in regards to ergonomics than the grinding on the feeder screw. The <b>split</b> <b>pipe</b> requires the operator to stand in a posture that takes more concentration and precision than for the feeder screw. The results from the dust measurements indicate that the levels of dust in the air, during the grinding, are within the approved limits. The safety equipment used by the operator is adequate, there has however been a desire of the client to find a solution that manages the dust.   One of the improvement proposals consists mainly of a number of accessories for the grinder to help improve the problems with vibration and the dust. The possibilities to circumvent the grinding work for the screw pipe altogether have been examined. It is possible to begin to mill the screw pipe in the lathe, which has a powered tool. For it to be possible to mill the <b>split</b> <b>pipe</b> instead of grinding, the lathe machine is in need of an extension arm, to be able to reach down the whole <b>split</b> <b>pipe.</b> This arm has been designed and developed in this project...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A simple {{processing}} method for <b>splitting</b> <b>pipes</b> in the axial direction using {{a cutting tool}} was investigated. The special tool developed {{in this study was}} pressed into the pipes in the axial direction, and the <b>pipes</b> were <b>split</b> very smoothly without any lubricant. This cutting method did not form fine chips, did not produce a significant heat effect on the inner wall surface. The splitting experiment was carried out with pipes constructed of aluminum and stainless steel. The outer diameters of the pipes were approximately 50 mm, and the thicknesses of the wall varied from 1 to 3 mm. The aluminum <b>pipes</b> were <b>split</b> very smooth by the tool, and curled strip-shaped chips were created by the splitting. On the other hand, the stainless pipes were greatly deformed, making them difficult to cut. Therefore, it was necessary to prevent deformation of the pipe by attaching an outer tool. The outer tool made it possible to cut stainless steel pipes...|$|R

A total of 28 test sections with various load transfer devices were placed. The devices include <b>split</b> <b>pipe,</b> figure eight, vee, double vee, and dowel bars. Patching materials used on the project included three types of fast-setting grouts, three brands of polymer concrete, and plain portland cement concrete. The number and spacing of the devices and dowel bars were also variables in the project. Dowel bars and double vee devices were used on the major portion of the project. Performance evaluations were based on deflection tests conducted with a 20, 000 -lb axle load. Horizontal joint movement measurements and visual observations were also made. The short-term performance data indicate good results with the dowel bar installations regardless of patching materials.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} and {{experimental study of}} a bilayered metamaterial structure for subwavelength imaging of magnetic field. The simplest version of such a structure consists {{of one or two}} linear arrays of capacitively loaded <b>split</b> <b>pipe</b> resonators. Its subwavelength physics is governed by strongly anisotropic magnetic coupling between individual resonators and by propagation of magnetoinductive waves with wavelength much shorter than the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation in free space. It is shown that magnetoinductive waves propagating in the lateral direction are undesirable because they spread the image. Good subwavelength imaging is achieved when, due to the strong interlayer coupling, a stop band {{in the vicinity of the}} resonant frequency appears in the dispersion characteristics. The imaging properties of the single and double lens are compared and it is shown that the double lens has a superior performance. Excellent agreement is obtained between experimental and theoretical results for the magnetic field in the image plane in the operation frequency range of 30 - 60 MHz. It is shown that the same mechanism is responsible for image formation using bilayered planar metamaterial structures and a design of such a lens comprising two planar layers with a total of 542 elements is provided.

30|$|There are few {{attempts}} in which cost and resilience considered as twin objectives to optimize network {{with the aim}} of arriving least cost network with best possible performance. Although the formulation of multi-objective problem for water distribution network is simple, solving and arriving Pareto front is found to be challenging. Bolognesi et al. (2014) developed pseudo-front in the hydraulically feasible region in the multi-objective design of water distribution network by combining any two objectives (i.e., cost and performance measures such as deviation from minimum of pressure deficit, deviation of velocity and resilience measure). The formulated problem in three different objectives was solved by genetic heritage and stochastic evolution transmission (GHEST) algorithm. Creaco et al. (2014) formulated a multi-objective optimization problem for phasing design of water distribution system, which has two objectives, one as minimizing the costs of the upgrades converted into value at the initial time and other as maximizing the minimum pressure surplus over time. Ostfeld et al. (2014) used genetic algorithm for the multi-objective optimization of water distribution network considering cost and resilience index as twin objectives of the design and utilized <b>split</b> <b>pipe</b> size method, which assign more than one diameter for each pipe in the network. Piratla (2015) presented a three-objective optimization model to obtain various sustainable and resilient design alternatives. The trade-off among three objectives can help to identify most beneficial solution from Pareto optimal set of solutions. Recently, Wang et al. (2014) applied various multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to generate true Pareto front for two-objective model that belongs to optimal design of water distribution network. The various algorithms were tested using 12 benchmark networks available in the literature. The results of study indicate that non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is found to be most promising approach for solving two-objective water distribution network problems. Creaco et al. (2016) proposed three-objective optimization model to minimize the costs and maximize both the resilience and the loop-based diameter uniformity indexes. The study provides an improvement in the NSGA-II algorithm to overcome the difficulties that arises with more than two objectives. Most of the previous studies focused more on generating true Pareto front to the problem in an efficient manner. The aim of the present work is to provide a simple way to decision makers for obtaining best solution while considering both objectives simultaneously with or without due weightage to particular objective function. Further, it brings out {{the way in which the}} resiliency of network gets increased at the expense of cost in optimal manner. Hence, minimizing the cost and maximizing the resilience index are dealt in two different ways as a single objective optimization problem and illustrated with widely used Hanoi water distribution networks.|$|E

40|$|This article {{explains}} how a multi-frequency ultrasonic beam path is split due to passing through dispersive {{materials and the}} implications that it has in flow measurement using a Clamp-on ultrasonic flowmeter. The importance of knowing this phenomenon is because dispersive materials are commonly used {{in the manufacture of}} transducer wedges and plastic <b>pipes.</b> <b>Splitting</b> of the ultrasonic beam path occurs when the incident angle is not normal {{to the surface of the}} pipe and a coupling wedge is necessary. The diffraction angle is produced at the boundaries among materials with different propagation velocities (according to Snell’s law), and furthermore, in dispersive materials, the propagation speed depends on frequency. Therefore, when the excitation signal contains several frequential components, each frequency travels with a different velocity. Under this circumstance, different diffraction angles are produced for each frequency at the boundaries between materials. As a result of splitting the path, the ultrasonic beam widens and the reception transducer aperture becomes too small to receive all the frequential components contained in the ultrasonic beam. Thus, when the ultrasonic beam is carried by the liquid flowing inside the pipe, the reception transducer receives different frequential contributions, producing change in its spectral composition. As a consequence of the mixing of these frequencies, the reception signal is modulated in phase and amplitude. Moreover, modulation will change as a function of frequential composition that is combined at the reception transducer. This is the origin of the linearity error in Clamp-on ultrasonic flowmeters.
