5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} this interaction, Presley and Jackson spoke on the telephone almost every day, forging a strong friendship. The two came to realize they had much in common: both had been protected and sheltered from the real world, both felt they had missed out on a normal childhood, both were mistrustful of outsiders having <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lives feeling exploited by them, and both had problems with the media. Presley was raised in Graceland, while Jackson lived at Neverland.|$|E

At the time, al-Jamri's family was composed of his parents and his 2-year-old brother Mohammed Jameel. He studied for five years at the Talibiya primary school which was also attended by some Bahrainis such as Sami, the elder son of Isa Qassim.

Edinburgh's New Town {{was the focus of}} this classical building boom in Scotland. From the mid-eighteenth century the it was laid out according to a plan of rectangular blocks with open squares, drawn up by James Craig. This classicism, together with its reputation as a major centre of the Enlightenment, resulted in the city being nicknamed [...] "The Athens of the North". However, the centralisation of much of the government administration, including the king's works, in London, meant that a number <b>of</b> Scottish architects <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>their</b> careers in England, where they had a major impact on Georgian architecture.|$|R
50|$|In 4th-century Armenia, as in Parthia, large estates were hereditarily {{possessed by}} noble {{families}} and actually ruled by one <b>of</b> <b>their</b> members. The whole enlarged family {{was devoted to}} the worship of the same ancestors, lived in small fortified villages and <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time in hunting and in banqueting. Furthermore, each nakharar family had a particular social function: in Armenia {{a member of the}} Arshakuni family was chosen as king, who was consequently a sort of primus inter pares; the Mamikonians fielded the sparapet, one of the Bagratunis was the cavalry chief (aspet) and king crowner (tagadir), and so on.|$|R
5|$|In the United States, {{sales of}} private {{underground}} blast shelters increased noticeably after 2009, with many construction companies' advertisements {{calling attention to}} the 2012 apocalypse. In Michigan, schools were closed for the Christmas holidays two days early, in part because rumours of the 2012 apocalypse were raising fears of repeat shootings similar to that at Sandy Hook. American reality TV stars Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt revealed that they had <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> $10 million of accumulated earnings by 2010 because they believed the world would end in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Not all mating {{takes place}} at the lek, since only a {{minority}} of the males attend an active lek. As alternative strategies, males can also directly pursue females ("following") or wait for them as they approached good feeding sites ("intercepting"). Males switched between the three tactics, being more likely to attend a lek when the copulation rate the previous day was high or when fewer females were available after nesting had started. Lekking rates were low in cold weather early in the season when off-lek males <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time feeding.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December 1886, munitions {{workers in}} Woolwich, now South East London, formed Arsenal as Dial Square, with David Danskin as their first captain. Named after {{the heart of}} the Royal Arsenal complex, they took the name of the whole complex a month later. Royal Arsenal F.C.'s first home was Plumstead Common, though they <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time in South East London playing {{on the other side of}} Plumstead, at the Manor Ground. Royal Arsenal won Arsenal's first trophies in 1890 and 1891, and these were the only {{football}} association trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East London. In 1891, Royal Arsenal became the first London club to turn professional.|$|E

5|$|Other artists {{influenced}} by modernism included James McIntosh Patrick (1907–98) and Edward Baird (1904–49). Both trained in Glasgow, but <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> careers {{in and around}} their respective native cities of Dundee and Montrose. Both were {{influenced by}} surrealism {{and the work of}} Bruegel. They focused on landscape, {{as can be seen in}} McIntosh Patrick's Traquair House (1938) and more overtly Baird's The Birth of Venus (1934). Before his success in painting, McIntosh Patrick gained a reputation as an etcher. Leading figures in the field in the inter-war period included William Wilson (1905–72) and Ian Fleming (1906–94).|$|E
5|$|Quainton Road {{station was}} built on a curve in {{the line at the}} nearest point to the Duke's estates at Wotton.

The railway towards Aylesbury crossed the road via a level crossing immediately southeast of the station. The Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway had <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> limited budget on the construction of the line itself.

5|$|The CIP was {{a scheme}} whereby US dollars {{were given to}} the South Vietnamese {{government}} treasury. Selected businesspeople were given import licenses that allowed them to purchase US dollars with South Vietnamese currency at a rate far below the market value. The importers then used their American currency to buy US goods, while the Saigon government kept the South Vietnamese currency paid by the businessmen to fund the military and public service. The objective of the mechanism was to inject large amounts of money into the economy in an indirect way, through material goods, so that inflation would be avoided. However, the initiative failed to generate much economic development, as licenseholders <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> funds on consumer goods.|$|E

Frusciante, Kiedis and Flea isolated themselves there for the duration of the recording. Frusciante and Flea seldom went outside, and <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time smoking marijuana.

5|$|The King George V-class battleships were a {{group of}} four {{dreadnought}} battleships built for the Royal Navy (RN) in the early 1910s that were sometimes termed super-dreadnoughts.

In October 1914, Audacious struck a mine and sank. Aside from participating in the failed attempt to intercept the German ships that had bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in late 1914, the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive Action of 19 August, the surviving ships' service during the First World War generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|As {{is common}} in {{frontier}} societies, the Southern Rhodesian settler community was mostly male: {{at the time of}} the First World War, white females were outnumbered by males almost two to one. Because white women were so marriageable and cheap black labour was easily available to handle domestic duties, most female settlers did not work and <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> days supervising the household and family. The average white woman in the colony continued to live this kind of life during the war, in marked contrast to her British counterpart, who in many cases went to replace the male factory workers and farm labourers who went to war. In Rhodesia little of this sort occurred: there were no munitions factories, and the idea of women working down the country's mines was not considered practical. Some white farmers' wives took over management of the land in their husbands' absence, but this was quite unusual.|$|E
