Furthermore, the effects of cooling rate and austenite grain size (AGS) on CCT behavior of the steel have been studied by employing high-resolution dilatometry. Quantitative metallography accompanied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has efficiently confirmed the dilatometric measurements of transformation kinetics and austenite decomposition products. A semi-empirical model has been proposed for prediction of microstructural development during austenite decomposition of the steel and the resultant hardness. The model consists of 8 sub-models including ferrite transformation <b>start</b> <b>temperature,</b> ferrite growth, pearlite <b>start</b> <b>temperature,</b> pearlite growth, bainite <b>start</b> <b>temperature,</b> bainite growth, martensite <b>start</b> <b>temperature</b> and hardness.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} <b>start</b> <b>temperature</b> and cooling rate of a slow freezing protocol on human blastocyst viability. DESIGN: Controlled-rate freezing of human blastocysts using different <b>start</b> <b>temperatures</b> and cooling rates. SETTING: Private assisted reproductive technology unit. PATIENT(S) : Patients donated with consent cryopreserved pronucleate embryos. INTERVENTION(S) : Culture of thawed pronucleate embryos in G III series media, containing hyaluronan, followed by cryopreservation of 36 blastocysts with subsequent noninvasive analysis of embryo metabolism. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Pyruvate and glucose consumption and blastocyst reexpansion and quality. RESULT(S) : Glucose consumption and blastocyst reexpansion after thaw were significantly higher when a <b>start</b> <b>temperature</b> of - 6 degrees C and a cooling rate of 0. 5 degrees C/min to - 32 degrees C were used compared with a <b>start</b> <b>temperature</b> of 20 degrees C and a cooling rate of 2 degrees C to - 6 degrees C, followed by cooling at 0. 3 degrees C to - 35 degrees C. Pyruvate uptake after thaw was not affected by the freezing procedure. Clinical use of the lower <b>start</b> <b>temperature</b> and quicker cooling rate, combined with culture in hyaluronan-based media, has led to the establishment of a 30 % implantation rate. CONCLUSION(S) : Human embryos cultured to the blastocyst stage in hyaluronan-based sequential media are readily cryopreserved and maintain their viability after thaw. David K.

The predicting ability of the existing model is improved considerably by critical assessment of different binary and ternary systems i. e. CALPHAD approach which is by wise selection of experimental data for optimization of the interaction parameters. Understanding the degree of variation in multi-component commercial alloys, various ternary systems such as Fe-Ni-X and Fe-Cr-X are optimized using both binary and ternary interaction parameters. The large variations between calculated and the experimental values are determined and reported for improvements in thermodynamics descriptions. Secondly, model for the prediction of Epsilon martensite <b>start</b> <b>temperature</b> of some commercial steels and shape memory alloys is newly introduced by optimizing Fe-Mn, Fe-Mn-Si and other Fe-Mn-X systems considering the commercial aspects in the recent development of light weight steels alloyed with Al and Si.

Finally, the model is validated using a data-set of 1500 commercial and novel alloys.
