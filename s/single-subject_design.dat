Together these studies suggest that HBOT at 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheric pressure does not result in a clinically significant improvement of the behavioral symptoms of autistic disorder.|$|E
50|$|In {{design of}} experiments, <b>single-subject</b> <b>design</b> or single-case {{research}} design {{is a research}} design most often used in applied fields of psychology, education, and human behavior in which the subject serves as his/her own control, rather than using another individual/group. Researchers use <b>single-subject</b> <b>design</b> because these designs are sensitive to individual organism differences vs group designs which are sensitive to averages of groups. Often there will be large numbers of subjects in a research study using <b>single-subject</b> <b>design,</b> however—because the subject serves as their own control, {{this is still a}} <b>single-subject</b> <b>design.</b> These designs are used primarily to evaluate the effect of a variety of interventions in applied research.|$|E

5000|$|Variability in data: Because {{behavior}} is assessed repeatedly, the <b>single-subject</b> <b>design</b> allows {{the researcher to}} see how consistently the treatment changes behavior over time. Large-group statistical designs do not typically provide this information because repeated assessments are not usually taken and the behavior of individuals in the groups are not scrutinized; instead, group means are reported.|$|E
50|$|Researchers {{utilizing}} <b>single-subject</b> <b>design</b> {{begin with}} graphic analysis. During the baseline, data are repeatedly collected and then graphed {{on the behavior}} of interest. This provides a visual representation of the subject's behavior before application of the intervention. It is critical that several (three to five is often recommended) data points are collected during baseline to allow the researcher to describe the effects on the target behavior during intervention.|$|E
50|$|Research {{designs are}} {{traditionally}} preplanned so {{that most of}} the details about to whom and when the intervention will be introduced are decided prior {{to the beginning of the}} study. However, in single-subject designs, these decisions are often made as the data are collected.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{illustrate}} the multilevel meta-analysis of results from <b>single-subject</b> experimental <b>designs</b> of different types, including AB phase designs, multiple-baseline designs, ABAB reversal designs, and alternating treatment designs. Current methodological work on the meta-analysis of <b>single-subject</b> experimental <b>designs</b> often focuses on combining simple AB phase designs or multiple-baseline designs. We discuss the estimation of the overall intervention effect estimate across different types of <b>single-subject</b> experimental <b>designs</b> using several multilevel meta-analytic models. We illustrate the different models using a re-analysis of a meta-analysis of <b>single-subject</b> experimental <b>designs</b> (Heyvaert, Saenen, Maes, & Onghena, 2014). The intervention effect estimates using univariate three-level models differ from those obtained using a multivariate three-level model that takes the dependence between effect sizes into account. Because different results are obtained and the multivariate model has multiple advantages, including more information and smaller standard errors, we recommend researchers to use the multivariate multilevel model to meta-analyze studies that utilize different <b>single-subject</b> <b>designs.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Some {{researchers}} have {{argued for the}} use of or have attempted to make use of randomization tests in single-subject research. To address this tide of interest, the authors of this article describe randomization tests, discuss the theoretical rationale for applying them to single-subject research, and provide an overview of the methodological research into the Type I error rates and statistical power of randomization tests in <b>single-subject</b> <b>designs.</b> It is found that randomization tests generally are an awkward fit to <b>single-subject</b> <b>designs,</b> and they are found to have low statistical power in single-subject contexts. It is therefore recommended that single-subject researchers make sparing, if any, use of randomization tests to analyze their data. Keywords randomization tests, single-subject research Randomization tests were developed more than 70 years ago (David, 2008). Until the 1980 s, they were used infrequently because of the extensive computations involved.

40|$|Research in {{conditioning}} (all {{the processes}} of preparation for competition) has used group research designs, where multiple athletes are observed at one or more points in time. However, empirical reports of large inter-individual differences in response to conditioning regimens suggest that applied conditioning research would greatly benefit from <b>single-subject</b> research <b>designs.</b> <b>Single-subject</b> research <b>designs</b> allow us {{to find out the}} extent to which a specific conditioning regimen works for a specific athlete, as opposed to the average athlete, who is the focal point of group research designs. The aim of the following review is to outline the strategies and procedures of single-subject research as they pertain to the assessment of conditioning for individual athletes. The four main experimental <b>designs</b> in <b>single-subject</b> research are: the AB design, reversal (withdrawal) designs and their extensions, multiple baseline designs and alternating treatment designs. Visual and statistical analyses commonly used to analyse single-subject data, and advantages and limitations are discussed. Modelling of multivariate single-subject data using techniques such as dynamic factor analysis and structural equation modelling may identify individualised models of conditioning leading to better prediction of performance. Despite problems associated with data analyses in single-subject research (e. g. serial dependency), sports scientists should use <b>single-subject</b> research <b>designs</b> in applied conditioning research to understand how well an intervention (e. g. a training method) works and to predict performance for a particular athlete. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: We review outcome studies {{regarding}} {{the effectiveness of}} hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Method: Studies were identified through electronic bibliographic databases and manual searches of article reference lists. Results: A total of 8 studies met eligibility criteria, consisting of three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one quasi-experimental study involving a comparison group, two pre-experimental one-group pretest–posttest studies, and two single-system designs. Studies reviewed did not offer credible {{evidence to suggest that}} HBOT is an effective treatment for autism. Conclusion: It is premature to call HBOT an effective treatment for Autism and ASD.
