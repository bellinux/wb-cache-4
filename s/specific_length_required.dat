25|$|In {{morphological}} dormancy, germination is prevented due to morphological {{characteristics of}} the embryo. In some species, the embryo is just a mass of cells when seeds are dispersed; it is not differentiated. Before germination can take place, both differentiation and growth of the embryo have to occur. In other species, the embryo is differentiated but not fully grown (underdeveloped) at dispersal, and embryo growth up to a species <b>specific</b> <b>length</b> is <b>required</b> before germination can occur. Examples of plant families where morphological dormancy occurs are Apiaceae, Cycadaceae, Liliaceae, Magnoliaceae and Ranunculaceae.|$|R

For musical applications it is simpler and its results are slightly more uniform than Stråhle's, and it has the advantage of producing the desired string lengths without additional scaling.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Fast and {{efficient}} accumulation arithmetic circuits {{are critical for}} {{a broad range of}} scientific and embedded system applications. High throughput accumulation circuits are typically hand designed for <b>specific</b> vector <b>lengths</b> <b>requiring</b> the circuit to be modified when the lengths are changed. In this work we present a new design approach that can achieve low latency and near optimal throughput for input data vectors of arbitrary length. The flexibility of the design allows it to be used for both integer and floating-point operations. By providing a simple {{and efficient}} interface to the user and a modular architecture for the designer, the proposed technique has broad impact across a wide range of custom hardware designs.

40|$|Micromixers with floor-grooved {{microfluidic}} channels {{have been}} successfully demonstrated in experiment. In this work, we numerically simulated the mixing within the devices and used the obtained concentration versus channel length profiles to quantitatively characterize the process. It {{was found that the}} concentration at any given cross-section location of the microfluidic channel periodically oscillates along the channel length, in coordination with the groove-caused helical flow during the mixing, and eventually converges to the neutral concentration value of two the mixing fluids. With these data, the <b>specific</b> channel <b>length</b> <b>required</b> for each helical flow to complete, the mixing efficiency of the devices, and the total channel <b>length</b> <b>required</b> to complete a mixing were easily defined and quantified, and were used to directly and comprehensively characterize the micromixing. This concentration versus channel length profile-based characterization method was also demonstrated in quantitatively analyzing the micromixing within a classic T mixer. It has clear advantages over the traditional concentration image-based characterization method that is only able to provide qualitative or semiquantitative information about a micromixing, and is expected to find an increasing use in studying mixing and optimizing device structure through numerical simulations...|$|R
