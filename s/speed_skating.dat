5|$|The arena was {{designed}} by Niels Torp, and Biong & Biong, and opened on 19 December 1992. The complex cost 230 million Norwegian krone (NOK). The localization was controversial, as it is located at Åkervika, a Ramsar site. It is Norway's national venue for <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> and bandy, and holds annual ISU <b>Speed</b> <b>Skating</b> World Cup races, as well as regular world championships. It has among other things hosted tournaments of the World Allround <b>Speed</b> <b>Skating</b> Championships, European <b>Speed</b> <b>Skating</b> Championships, World Single Distance Championships, World Sprint <b>Speed</b> <b>Skating</b> Championships, UCI Track Cycling World Championships, Speedway Grand Prix and World Rally Championship.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> {{competition}} {{took place}} on 24 January 1917, and the stadium remained in use for <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> until 1929. AIF arranged their Norwegian championships in <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> at Dælenenga in 1926 and 1929. Finland's Clas Thunberg set two unofficial world records in 1,000 meters of 1:31.60 twice in 1921.|$|E
5|$|The venue is the {{national}} stadium for <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> in Norway. It hosts annual ISU <b>Speed</b> <b>Skating</b> World Cup, and has in addition hosted many European and world championships. This includes the World Allround <b>Speed</b> <b>Skating</b> Championships in 1993 (for men), 1999, 2004, 2009, 2013 and 2017 tournaments. The World Sprint <b>Speed</b> <b>Skating</b> Championships has been held in 1997, 2002 and 2007, while the World Single Distance Championships was held in 1996. The European <b>Speed</b> <b>Skating</b> Championships has been held four times, in 1994, 2000, 2006, 2010 and 2014.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>skates</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>skates</b> differ {{greatly from}} hockey skates and figure skates. Unlike hockey skates and figure <b>skates,</b> <b>speed</b> <b>skates</b> cut {{off at the}} ankle and are built more like a shoe than a boot to allow for more ankle compression. The blades range in length on average from 12" [...] to 18" [...] {{depending}} on the age and height of the skater. Short track blades are fixed to the boot in two places once at the heel and the other right behind the ball of the foot. Long track skates, also called klap skates, attach firmly to the boot only at the front. The heel of the boot actually detaches from the blade every stroke. This is accomplished through a spring mechanism located at the front connector. <b>Speed</b> <b>skates</b> cannot be sharpened at a shop like most skates. Instead each skater sharpens {{his or her own}} skates. This is accomplished using a jig which is a frame to hold the skates in place while they are manually sharpened.|$|R
5|$|In March 2011, the Norwegian Skating Association {{announced}} that they indented that the Norwegian World Cup events would be moved to Sørmarka Arena in Stavanger, due to low attendance at Vikingskipet. Vikingskipet has been selected to host the 2013 World Allround <b>Speed</b> <b>Skating</b> Championships. Lillehammer is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, with Vikingskipet to host long track <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> events.|$|E
5|$|Vikingskipet {{has been}} the venues for world records in <b>speed</b> <b>skating,</b> track cycling, ice sledge speed racing and frisbee. The {{following}} {{is a list of}} world records set in Vikingskipet, including the sport, event, gender, time or distance, the athlete, their country and the date the record was set. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, four of the five distances for men's <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> received new world records.|$|E
5|$|Australia won {{its first}} medal, a bronze, in 1994 in the men's 5,000metres short track relay <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> event. Zali Steggall gained Australia's first {{individual}} medal in 1998, {{when she won}} bronze in the slalom event. In 2002, Steven Bradbury won the 1,000metres short track <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> and Alisa Camplin won the aerials event, making Australia the only southern hemisphere country to have {{won a gold medal}} at a Winter Olympics.|$|E

5|$|Short track <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> is a {{sport that}} is contested at the Winter Olympic Games. The first Winter Olympics, held in 1924, {{included}} <b>speed</b> <b>skating,</b> but the first official short track <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> events were not held until the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. Before 1992, short track <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> events were held at the 1988 Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport. At those games, events {{for both men and}} women were held in five disciplines: 500 metre, 1000 metre, 1500 metre, 3000 metre and the relay (3000 metres for women, 5000 metres for men). The Netherlands, United Kingdom and South Korea won two gold medals each, with Canada, Italy, Japan and China picking up a gold medal each. The results of those demonstration events are not considered official and are not included in this list. At the 1992 Winter Olympics, there were four medal events: men's 1000 metres, men's 5000 metre relay, women's 500 metres and women's 3000 metre relay. Men's 500 metres and women's 1000 metres was added in 1994. The men's and women's 1500 metres were added in 2002 and all eight events have been held at every Olympic Games since.|$|E
5|$|There was a tie {{for third}} place in the men's 500-metre event in <b>speed</b> <b>skating,</b> {{therefore}} two bronze medals were awarded.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the mathematical derivation {{of a new}} model of <b>speed</b> <b>skate</b> ice friction. The model acronym is FAST, which stands for Friction Algorithm using <b>Speed</b> <b>Skate</b> Thermohydrodynamics. Mutatis mutandis, it is applicable to other ice friction problems in the hydrodynamic friction regime. The paper updates and corrects an earlier publication of the model (FAST 1. 0) that omitted the full derivation of the lubrication equation. It also presents a more thorough exploration of the model results and its sensitivity to the variation of physical variables.

5|$|Australia has {{competed in}} either the long track or short track forms of <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> at every Olympics that it has attended, except 1964. Australia's Winter Olympic inaugural {{participant}} was long track speed skater Kenneth Kennedy, who competed in 1936 {{and placed in the}} bottom 25% in all of his four events. Colin Hickey finished seventh in 1956 in the 500 and 1,000m long track <b>speed</b> <b>skating,</b> and placed 13th and 14th four years later. Until 1968, Hickey's four aforementioned results were the only times that an Australian finished in the top half of their event.|$|E
5|$|CC Amfi, {{also known}} as Nordlyshallen ("The Northern Light Hall") is an indoor sports arena in Hamar, Norway. It is mostly used for ice hockey and is the home arena of Storhamar Hockey. It has also been used for short track <b>speed</b> <b>skating,</b> figure skating, handball, events and concerts. The venue has a {{capacity}} for 7,000 spectators and was built for the 1994 Winter Olympics, where it was used for short track <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> and figure skating. Other major events held at the arena include the 1999 IIHF World Championship in ice hockey, the 1999 World Women's Handball Championship, the 2012 IPC Ice Sledge Hockey World Championships and the scheduled 2016 Winter Youth Olympics.|$|E
5|$|During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre {{was used}} for figure skating and short track <b>speed</b> <b>skating.</b> It hosted 13 events, drawing an average of 5,554 spectators. Storhamar Ishall {{was used for}} warming up and {{training}} to these events.|$|E
50|$|For the 1994-1995 season, 11 skaters {{from the}} South Holland 14 - 18 age {{category}} started using the clap skate competitively.

50|$|Traditionally, roller disco skaters wore {{an artistic}} high-cut boot with toe stop. In the early 1980s, this transitioned into a trend of wearing low-cut <b>speed</b> <b>skate</b> boots with jam plugs {{in place of}} the toe stops. This trend {{continues}} today, as the low-cut boot allows for more agility with feet while skating.|$|R

5|$|During {{the process}} of the Lillehammer bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics, the International Olympic Committee had not {{specified}} that it was necessary with an indoor <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> rink. Calgary had used the indoor Olympic Oval during the 1988 Winter Olympics, but Albertville, who were awarded the 1992 Winter Olympics, had opted for the outdoor L'anneau de vitesse. In its bid, the <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> events were planned held at Stampesletta, an outdoor track and field stadium in Lillehammer. Only after Lillehammer had been awarded the 1994 Winter Olympics was it decided that an indoor venue would have to be built for the games.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 the Canadian city of Calgary {{hosted the}} first Winter Olympics to span 16days. New events were added in ski-jumping and speed skating; while future Olympic sports curling, short track <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> and {{freestyle}} skiing made their appearance as demonstration sports. For {{the first time}} the <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> events were held indoors, on the Olympic Oval. Dutch skater Yvonne van Gennip won three gold medals and set two world records, beating skaters from the favoured East German team in every race. Her medal total was equalled by Finnish ski jumper Matti Nykänen, who won all three events in his sport. Alberto Tomba, an Italian skier, made his Olympic debut by winning both the giant slalom and slalom. East German Christa Rothenburger won the women's 1,000metre <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> event. Seven months later she would earn a silver in track cycling at the Summer Games in Seoul, to become the only athlete to win medals in both a Summer and Winter Olympics in the same year.|$|E

50|$|Turning is {{significantly}} more difficult with inline <b>speed</b> <b>skates</b> than recreational skates because of more and larger wheels, creating a longer wheelbase. The wheel profile, that is, the cross-section, is parabolic, with a sharper shape than recreational or aggressive wheels, allowing the skater to essentially skate on a smaller, and hence more agile, wheel when leaned {{over in a}} turn.|$|R
5|$|Van Dijk {{started her}} career as a speed skater. As a very young child, she had {{performed}} in natural ice skating tours and, at the age of eight, she became a member of a local <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> club. During the winter months, Van Dijk trained almost every day at the local <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> rink in Utrecht. She did this from when she was aged twelve until she was twenty years old. Van Dijk competed five times in the junior Dutch Allround Championships; she finished in tenth place on two occasions in the all-around competition and in fourth place in the 3000m in 2005. She also rode the track record at the 5000 metres.|$|E
5|$|Bislett {{remained}} a <b>speed</b> <b>skating</b> venue until 1988, after which it only hosted athletics and football. Between 1925 and 1986, it saw 13 world championships and 10 European championships in <b>speed</b> <b>skating.</b> The structure was demolished {{and replaced with}} a new stadium in 2005. It hosts the annual Bislett Games, {{now part of the}} Diamond League in athletics. Marienlyst is used as a football stadium, and hosts both Strømsgodset IF and the Norway national under-21 football team. Lillestrøm, Dælenenga and Kadettangen are only used for lower-level football, as they lack any significant spectator stands. Jordal Amfi received a roof in 1972 and hosted the World Ice Hockey Championships in 1958 and 1999. Holmenkollbakken has been rebuilt several times since the Olympics; most recently it was entirely rebuilt in 2010. The complex has received a ski stadium, collectively known as Holmenkollen National Arena. In addition to the annual Holmenkollen Ski Festival, the hill hosted the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in 1930, 1966, 1982 and 2011.|$|E
5|$|Eight new {{events were}} introduced: {{snowboard}} cross, team pursuit (<b>speed</b> <b>skating),</b> team sprint (cross-country skiing), and the mass-start race (biathlon). The team sprint events replaced the classical men's 30kilometers (km) and women's 15km cross-country distances, {{held at the}} previous Winter Games in 2002. In total, there were six more events than in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, United States.|$|E
