"So {{much for}} myself; yet I tell you but a tithe {{of my own}} story unless I let you know how matters stand with poor Hudson, for he gives me more to think about just now than {{anything}} else in the world. I need a good deal of courage to begin this chapter. You warned me, you know, and I made rather light of your warning. I have had all kinds of hopes and fears, but hitherto, in writing to you, I have resolutely put the hopes foremost. Now, however, my pride has forsaken me, and I should like hugely to give expression to a little comfortable despair. I should like to say, 'My dear wise woman, you were right and I was wrong; you were a shrewd observer and I was a meddlesome donkey!' When I think of a little talk we had about the 'salubrity of genius,' I feel my ears tingle. If this is salubrity, give me raging disease! I 'm pestered to death; I go about with a chronic heartache; there are moments when I could shed salt tears. There 's a pretty portrait of the most placid of men! I wish I could make you understand; or rather, I wish you could make me! I don't understand a jot; it 's a hideous, mocking mystery; I give it up! I don't in the least give it up, you know; I 'm incapable of giving it up. I sit holding my head by the hour, racking my brain, wondering what under heaven is to be done. You told me at Northampton that I took the thing too easily; you would tell me now, perhaps, that I take it too hard. I do, altogether; but it can't be helped. Without flattering myself, I may say I 'm sympathetic. Many another man before this would have cast his perplexities to the winds and declared that Mr. Hudson must lie on his bed as he had made it. Some men, perhaps, would even say that I am making a mighty ado about nothing; that I have only to give him rope, and he will tire himself out. But he tugs at his rope altogether too hard for me to hold it comfortably. I certainly never pretended the thing was anything else than an experiment; I promised nothing, I answered for nothing; I only said the case was hopeful, {{and that it would be}} a shame to neglect it. I have done my best, and if the machine is running down I have a right to stand aside and let it scuttle. Amen, amen! No, I can write that, but I can't feel it. I can't be just; I can only be generous. I love the poor fellow and I can't give him up. As for understanding him, that 's another matter; nowadays I don't believe even you would. One's wits are sadly pestered over here, I assure you, and I 'm in the way of seeing more than one puzzling specimen of human nature. Roderick and Miss Light, between them!... Have n't I already told you about Miss Light? Last winter everything was perfection. Roderick struck out bravely, did really great things, and proved himself, as I supposed, thoroughly solid. He was strong, he was first-rate; I felt perfectly secure and sang private paeans of joy. We had passed at a bound into the open sea, and left danger behind. But in the summer I began to be puzzled, though I succeeded in not being alarmed. When we came back to Rome, however, I saw that the tide had turned and that we were close upon the rocks. It is, in fact, another case of Ulysses alongside of the Sirens; only Roderick refuses to be tied to the mast. He is the most extraordinary being, the strangest mixture of qualities. I don't understand so much force going with so much weakness--such a brilliant gift being subject to such lapses. The poor fellow is incomplete, and it is really not his own fault; Nature has given him the faculty out of hand and bidden him be hanged with it. I never knew a man harder to advise or assist, if he is not in the mood for listening. I suppose there is some key or other to his character, but I try in vain to find it; and yet I can't believe that Providence is so cruel as to have turned the lock and thrown the key away. He perplexes me, as I say, to death, and though he tires out my patience, he <b>still</b> <b>fascinates</b> <b>me.</b> Sometimes I think he has n't a grain of conscience, and sometimes I think that, in a way, he has an excess. He takes things at once too easily and too hard; he is both too lax and too tense, too reckless and too ambitious, too cold and too passionate. He has developed faster even than you prophesied, and for good and evil alike he takes up a formidable space. There 's too much of him for me, at any rate. Yes, he is hard; there is no mistake about that. He 's inflexible, he 's brittle; and though he has plenty of spirit, plenty of soul, he has n't what I call a heart. He has something that Miss Garland took for one, and I 'm pretty sure she 's a judge. But she judged on scanty evidence. He has something that Christina Light, here, makes believe at times that she takes for one, but she is no judge at all! I think it is established that, in the long run, egotism makes a failure in conduct: is it also true that it makes a failure in the arts?... Roderick's standard is immensely high; I must do him that justice. He will do nothing beneath it, and while he is waiting for inspiration, his imagination, his nerves, his senses must have something to amuse them. This is a highly philosophical way of saying that he has taken to dissipation, and that he has just been spending a month at Naples--a city where 'pleasure' is actively cultivated--in very bad company. Are they all like that, all the men of genius? There are a great many artists here who hammer away at their trade with exemplary industry; in fact I am surprised at their success in reducing the matter to a steady, daily grind: but I really don't think that one of them has his exquisite quality of talent. It is in the matter of quantity that he has broken down. The bottle won't pour; he turns it upside down; it 's no use! Sometimes he declares it 's empty--that he has done all he was made to do. This I consider great nonsense; but I would nevertheless take him on his own terms if it was only I that was concerned. But I keep thinking of those two praying, trusting neighbors of yours, and I feel wretchedly like a swindler. If his working mood came but once in five years I would willingly wait for it and maintain him in leisure, if need be, in the intervals; but that would be a sorry account to present to them. Five years of this sort of thing, moreover, would effectually settle the question. I wish he were less of a genius and more of a charlatan! He 's too confoundedly all of one piece; he won't throw overboard a grain of the cargo to save the rest. Fancy him thus with all his brilliant personal charm, his handsome head, his careless step, his look as of a nervous nineteenth-century Apollo, and you will understand that there is mighty little comfort in seeing him in a bad way. He was tolerably foolish last summer at Baden Baden, but he got on his feet, and for a while he was steady. Then he began to waver again, and at last toppled over. Now, literally, he 's lying prone. He came into my room last night, miserably tipsy. I assure you, it did n't amuse me..... About Miss Light it 's a long story. She is one of the great beauties of all time, and worth coming barefoot to Rome, like the pilgrims of old, to see. Her complexion, her glance, her step, her dusky tresses, may have been seen before in a goddess, but never in a woman. And you may take this for truth, because I 'm not in love with her. On the contrary! Her education has been simply infernal. She is corrupt, perverse, as proud as the queen of Sheba, and an appalling coquette; but she is generous, and with patience and skill you may enlist her imagination in a good cause as well as in a bad one. The other day I tried to manipulate it a little. Chance offered me an interview to which it was possible to give a serious turn, and I boldly broke ground and begged her to suffer my poor friend to go in peace. After a good deal of finessing she consented, and the next day, with a single word, packed him off to Naples to drown his sorrow in debauchery. I have come to the conclusion that she is more dangerous in her virtuous moods than in her vicious ones, and that she probably has a way of turning her back which is the most provoking thing in the world. She 's an actress, she could n't forego doing the thing dramatically, and it was the dramatic touch that made it fatal. I wished her, of course, to let him down easily; but she desired to have the curtain drop on an attitude, and her attitudes deprive inflammable young artists of their reason..... Roderick made an admirable bust of her at the beginning of the winter, and a dozen women came rushing to him to be done, mutatis mutandis, in the same style. They were all great ladies and ready to take him by the hand, but he told them all their faces did n't interest him, and sent them away vowing his destruction." ...|$|E
40|$|I {{really enjoyed}} doing this assignment. The thought that {{something}} {{as common as}} riding a bicycle is yet far more complicated than one would expect intrigued me. And when I now think {{of the dynamics of}} a bicycle the ingenious mecha-nism <b>still</b> <b>fascinates</b> <b>me.</b> Also this assignment has learned me a lot more than I would have thought. I gained {{a lot of respect for}} scientist who do the same things every day. First of all I want to thank my supervisors Dr. ir. A. L. Schwab and Ir. J. D. G. Kooijman whom gave me excellent support and were always ready to answer my questions. Their essential input guided me towards todays results. Special thanks also to my wife Danja who has supported me throughout my education at the technical university. During my graduation she had to sacrifice a lot of time that was otherwise spent together. Also I would like to thank the other members of the examination committee Prof. dr. D. J. Rixen and Dr. ir. J. L. Herder for their effort that they put into studying the report and the exam...|$|E
40|$|This {{semester}} I {{have designed}} the Tokyo Tourist Towers. This has {{allowed me to}} be creative in a way I thought never possible. With my site being located in the centre of a major and highly populated city, I decided to design a building that serves as a tourist attraction. My design provides the tourists with the experience of the Japanese culture in a contemporary setting, with a range of activities from calligraphy to tea ceremonies, lounge to restaurant and even a separate hotel to stay in while enjoying a getaway. Being two towers, each building has a unique appearance. With the river canal as a focal point of my design, I have orientated my building towards it (South facing), with all other sides being plain in appearance. The West tower, being a hotel, is vertical and symmetrical with a “man made” appearance. On the other hand, the East Tower, being full of a range of Japanese activities, is juxtaposed. With a leaning tower and some sloping floors and ceilings this tower is given the appearance of “machine made”. This is shown through the materials being glass and steel structure. Each space designed also has a unique appearance and feel. It <b>still</b> <b>fascinates</b> <b>me</b> how different spaces can be both distinct as well as unique from one to another. It is not until the space is created in 3 D that you realise how the size, whether it is the floor area or the ceiling height, can really change the feeling of the space dramatically. An example of this is how a leaning wall can really affect the space and the way it is designed. The Tokyo Tourist Towers is linked by a central lift shaft, which not only provides a stable structure but also a connection point that links the two contrasting buildings together. My design then becomes not just two separate building towers but one building in a whole. DESA 1002 (Design and Practice...|$|E
5000|$|Kristo finally {{received}} his first guitar at age 12. He began playing ail the hits he {{heard on the}} radio. Two years later, he was guitarist {{in one of the}} four groups in his school. At age 18, he formed a trio that played only his own compositions. The three musicians constantly played each other’s instruments during their concerts. He was the lead singer in a group that mostly played assiko music, which no young people usually played. Kristo says, “my buddies didn’t understand how a guy like me who spent his vacations in Paris was still interested in village music. Even though I liked disco and ail the music in fashion, that music <b>still</b> <b>fascinated</b> <b>me.</b> Why? I can’t tell you. But I found real pleasure in playing Jean Bikoko, Médjo Me Nsom and Dikoumé Bernard, and to finger the guitar strings like them in an unusual way. The assiko musicians and dancers have a special knowledge and a particular technique. I liked their style of music because it was different. But I was just as interested in classical technique as in that of the forest guitarists.” ...|$|R
40|$|The work {{started when}} I first {{registered}} {{as a part}} time Postgraduate student at Warwick, after finishing my MSc degree in medical sociology at Bedford College, London University in October 1982. Some preliminary investment had been done and a few essays written while I was in Taiwan teaching in a medical school. But {{it was only after}} April 1985, when I secured a grant from the Chinese Central Government in Taiwan to come over to England again and switched to full time study that the real work could really start. Since then, many parts of the work have been changed, such as the target problems and the methodology to tackle them. The whole working process was dynamic. Ideas exchanged, floating to and fro between my supervisor, Professor Margaret Stacey and me over years to find out results, as well as problems and methods. Only the original purpose of the study (Chinese women) and the sample group (nurses) have remained the same and <b>still</b> <b>fascinate</b> <b>me.</b> The problems were focussed gradually. The process of emergence of the problems and the conceptual framework used in the study will be described in part 1 : introduction. The methodology changed in response to the focusing of the problems. Both the original plan and the evolving current design will be presented in Part 2 : the research process. The field work and data analysis will be also dealt with in the same part. Some further but small alterations away from the research pIan were made to adjust to the situation of the field work as it happened in practice. Part 3 will be the results of the historical and literature review. The literature review gave me a more clear and closer look at my sample against their background of Chinese women's life in the past (chapter 8) and at the present day in Taiwan (chapter 10). Also traditional Chinese women healers and carers and the modern nursing history (chapter 9) were brought to light to elucidate the problems in nursing today. Part 4 will be the emergent themes which were attained through analysis of the field work. From these themes, a general profile of the life of these women in our sample in present day Taiwan gradually emerged. In part 5 conclusions are drawn concerning 'the new patriarchy', in which our respondents' lives are formed, as always around their menfolk – father, husband and son - although with certain differences from the situation in the past. ...|$|R
