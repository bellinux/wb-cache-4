5|$|Colorado {{departed}} New York Harbor on 29 December 1923 {{to start}} a maiden voyage to Europe. The voyage took her to Britain, France, Italy and the peninsula of Gibraltar, with port calls to Portsmouth, Cherbourg, Villefranche, Naples, and the British base at Gibraltar. She returned to New York Harbor on 15 February 1924 and upon her return completed <b>some</b> <b>final</b> tests and undertook some repairs before sailing to the U.S. West Coast for force assignment. She steamed from New York Harbor on 11 July and arrived at San Francisco on 15 September.|$|E
5|$|Despite her 50 guns, Centurions {{armament}} {{left her}} vulnerable as most were carronades, short-range heavy cannon that were useless {{in the face}} of the long-range gunnery from Marengo. Centurion consequently suffered severe damage and by 13:15 had been holed, with her rigging wrecked and her anchor cable shot through, which caused her to slowly drift away from the shore, out of control. Seeing that his opponent was disabled, Linois decided not to press the attack and issued orders for his squadron, accompanied by their prize, to sail away. Lind gradually regained control of his ship and even managed to raise some sail in pursuit, but the French were too far ahead. After <b>some</b> <b>final</b> parting shots, Centurion anchored as her crew set about repairing the damage. Linois remained within sight for the rest of the day, but showed no sign of renewing the action; he disappeared on the north-east horizon at dusk.|$|E
5|$|Faced by {{the threat}} of a {{sovereign}} default and potential resulting exit of the eurozone, <b>some</b> <b>final</b> attempts were made by the Greek government in May 2015 to settle an agreement with the Troika about some adjusted terms for Greece to comply with in order to activate the transfer of the frozen bailout funds in its current programme. The Eurogroup recently granted a six-month technical extension of its current bailout programme to Greece (now set to expire by the end of June 2015), which means the time window to complete negotiations and subsequently implement the conditional measures to unlock the remaining bailout transfers now is very short. Expectations are that Greece in addition will need a follow-up support programme starting 1 July 2015. The Troika announced the condition for offering Greece (and begin negotiations about) establishment of a follow-up programme would be a prior successful completion of the re-negotiated current programme.|$|E

5|$|When {{the first}} traffic flowed, crews had not {{finished}} <b>some</b> <b>final</b> tasks, such as painting stripes. Motorists saw a relocation with several mountain cuts built high up the canyon wall, {{with a view}} of the slide and former lake. The roadbed was not expected to last, as weather conditions had been unfavorable when the asphalt was laid. Two mountain cuts were unstable, requiring several months of work before they could be left unattended. During this time, the state stationed two full-time watches at the cuts, who would close the road while falling rocks were cleared. The cut through Billies Mountain was described by the construction crews as a new, man-made mountain pass.|$|E
5|$|By then, MacLaren was in {{financial}} difficulties. As an amateur, his expenses {{were covered by}} the tour organisers but he received no money for playing. To support him financially, the Lancashire committee had given him £100 before the tour. By the latter stages of the tour, his money was running out; {{most of it was}} probably spent betting on horse races, and he sent Lancashire a request for further money. Just before the final Test, he received a £60 advance on his expenses for the upcoming English season. For the fifth Test, he dropped down from opening the batting, which he had done throughout the series, to batting at number five, and responded with his first Test century. Batting with greater caution than usual, he scored 120 before accidentally standing on his own wicket. England won the match to take the series 3–2, amid great public interest in England and Australia. MacLaren scored 240 runs at 26.67 in the Test series, finishing fourth in the English averages. He performed more effectively in the lesser matches, and following <b>some</b> <b>final</b> tour fixtures, he totalled 803 runs at 47.23 in all first-class games. On the six-week outward journey MacLaren met (Kathleen) Maud Power, an Australian socialite and the daughter of a horse racing official. They were married in 1898.|$|E

In June 2013, Pusha T had been set to turn in the album to Def Jam for mastering, however, Kanye West presented Pusha with some additional beats. This resulted in Pusha going back to the studio to continue the recording. In early stages in the recording process, he began working on the album with Kanye West, Symbolyc One, The Neptunes, Bangladesh, and Ryan Leslie. Since then, he has confirmed that he was working with The-Dream, Just Blaze, No I.D., Nottz, Don Cannon, Nashiem Myrick, Carlos Brody (of The Hitmen), DJ Mano, Swizz Beatz, Rico Beats, Travi$ Scott, Hudson Mohawke, Young Chop, and Sham, amongst others on the album's production. On August 4, 2013 he {{announced that}} the song he wants to be the album's intro is produced by Joaquin Phoenix. On August 22, 2013, Pusha T appeared on MTV's RapFix and told Sway Calloway that the bulk of the album's production would be handled by Kanye West, while confirming production by Pharrell, Swizz Beatz, The-Dream, Nottz, and Don Cannon to be featured on the album.|$|E

25|$|This {{campaign}} was interrupted in 1519 as work was going {{forward by the}} condition of French occupation in Lombardy after the War of the League of Cambrai. French troops were encamped round the Certosa. Notations of work on the facade did not resume until 1554, when a revised design {{under the direction of}} Cristoforo Lombardo was approved for the completion of the facade above the second arcade; there marble intarsia was substituted for the rich sculptual decorations of the lower area. <b>Some</b> <b>final</b> details were added by Galeazzo Alessi.|$|E

The GBA version used its own engine developed by Saffire, but the gameplay and storyline were derived from Inevitable's build. At the 2003 E3 event in June, a three level playable demo was made available for all systems, featuring the opening level, the spider level in Mirkwood and the level were Bilbo sneaks into Smaug's layer.

25|$|A replica Vimy, NX71MY, {{was built}} in Australia and the USA in 1994 for an American, Peter McMillan, who flew it from England to Australia with Australian Lang Kidby in 1994 to re-enact the first England-Australia flight by Ross & Keith Smith with Vimy G-EAOU in 1919. In 1999, Mark Rebholz and John LaNoue re-enacted the first flight from London to Cape Town with this same replica, and in late 2006 the {{aeroplane}} was donated to Brooklands Museum at Weybridge, Surrey.

25|$|The Cathedral is to {{the north}} of the main plaza and it is the most emblematic symbol of the city. However, the main facade does not face the Zócalo, rather it faces its own atrium which is called the Cathedral Plaza. The Cathedral began as a modest church {{dedicated}} to the Virgin of the Assumption built in 1528. When Chiapas became a diocese in the 17th century, with San Cristóbal as its seat, this church was torn down to build the current structure, dedicated to Saint Christopher, the patron of the city. The overall structure contains European Baroque, Moorish and indigenous influences. The main facade was finished in 1721 and <b>some</b> <b>final</b> touches were added in the 20th century. The main feature of the church is its main facade, which was finished in 1721. It is Baroque painted yellow with ornamental columns and niches in which are various saints. It is divided into three horizontal and three vertical levels marked off by pairs of Solomonic columns and meant to resemble an altarpiece. It is further decorated with intricate raised stucco work mostly in white which show Oaxacan and Guatemalan influences. The layout of the interior shows Moorish influence. The main altar is dedicated to both the Virgin of the Assumption and Saint Christopher. The wood pulpit is from the 16th century and gilded. The side walls have two Baroque altarpieces, one to the Virgin of the Assumption and the other to John of Nepomuk. There is also a small chapel dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe on the north side. The sacristy has a large colonial era paintings of Jesus in Gesethame by Juan Correa as well as paintings by Miguel Cabrera and Eusebio de Aguilar. It is common to see older indigenous women in the Cathedral, with some even traversing the entire nave on their knees to approach the large image of Jesus handing above the Baroque altar.|$|E
