By allowing for individual bank specific effects in the empirical models we specifically seek evidence of a bank-lending channel for the transmission of monetary policy shocks in Finland.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a case study of}} a primary school in a highly diverse urban {{neighbourhood}} in Sweden. Basic pre-conditions for intercultural school development are studied by examining the overall organisation of teaching, learning and opportunities for collaboration in the investigated case. The study focuses on the targeted <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> to enhance learning for students with an immigrant background: Mother tongue instruction, Swedish as a Second Language, and tutoring in the mother tongue, as well as looking at pedagogical support provided by the school library. The latter has a mission to promote learning and inclusion, where non-native speakers of Swedish are a prioritised group. Communities of practice linked to the work organisation at a meso-level are investigated, and the collaborative relationships between professional groups at the school involved in the various <b>support</b> <b>measures.</b> Teacher relationships and categorisations implied by <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> impact the learning spaces that are shaped for students and the teaching spaces within which teachers work. Collaborative opportunities and convergence of concerns in the teaching spaces combine to shape the overall space for intercultural development. The raw data for the case study consists of interviews, national policy documents and additional information on local work organisation gained through documents and observations. Four articles resulted from the case study, each focusing a <b>specific</b> <b>support</b> <b>measure.</b> An overarching analysis is then made of findings from these articles and the other dimensions of the investigation. The analysis describes the organisation in terms of monocultural or intercultural school cultures, pointing to significant characteristics of the landscapes of practice, with respect to their overall implications for the spaces of school development. In the discussion, findings are considered in relation to research on professional development in education, collaboration, democracy and inclusive schooling. The relative positioning of languages and cultures is given particular attention, to ascertain if the school culture is monocultural or intercultural in the sense given by Lahdenperä (2008), and to what extent it could enable intercultural development. Such positioning plays a role interms of affordances for identity, participation and engagement discussed by Wenger (1998). This case study should be understood against the wider background of recent social developments in Europe linked to globalisation and technological changes. It is argued that looking at the concrete specifics which facilitate or obstruct school development, and simultaneously reflecting on how the different forms of teaching interrelate in the overall organisation and in policy may provide a useful vantage point from which structural changes can be contemplated. The discussion underlines the importance of the physical localisation of activities, continuity in personal contacts and time available for joint pedagogical reflection, as basic conditions for effective intercultural dialogue in the organisation. Finally, the impact of policy is considered, looking at connections between levels of policy, expressed in official steering documents, and conditions for teaching and learning at the level of an individual school...|$|R

40|$|The core {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to elaborate on historically implemented promotion strategies of renewable energy sources and the associated deployment within the European electricity market. Hence, at a first glance, the historic development of renewable energy sources in the electricity (RES-E) sector is addressed on Member State and on sectoral level as well as consequently discussed according to available RES-E potentials and costs. The specific focus of this paper, are promotion strategies for RES-E options as they are the key driver of an efficient and effective RES-E deployment. Therefore, the paper depicts the main types of different promotion schemes and their properties. Additionally, several cases studies of different European Member States show an in-depth analysis of the different RES-E promotion schemes. In this context, special emphasises are put on the question of effective and efficient promotion scheme designs of different RES-E technologies. Generally, conducted research led to the conclusion, that technology <b>specific</b> financial <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> of RES-E performed much more effective and efficient than others did. Hence, it is not all about the common question of feed-in tariffs vs. quota systems based on tradable green certificates, but more about the design criteria of implemented RES-E support schemes.

It was therefore the goal of this study to assess the objective life situation and subjective quality of life, as well as the differences, similarities and interrelations, at the onset of schizophrenia in women and men. Ninety schizophrenic patients were interviewed between the second and fourth weeks of their first hospital stay using the Berlin Quality of Life Profile, and rated according to the BPRS. Areas of social problems (work, living circumstances, safety and drug abuse) had become manifest with several of the patients, particularly among the young men, prior to first admission. Although objective conditions, gender and psychopathology {{have an impact on the}} subjective quality of life, it cannot be fully explained by them. Multivariate analyses have demonstrated that the factors influencing it are probably different for women and men, and schizophrenic women appraise their life circumstances in a different manner from men, as is true for differences between the statements of acutely and chronically ill patients. It can be concluded from the results of this study that psychiatric services should offer <b>specific</b> social <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> before or at first hospital admission and not after the illness has become chronic.

Aim:To describe decision-making processes that influence transitions in care when approaching the end of life. Design:Qualitative study using field observations and longitudinal semi-structured interviews. Setting/participants: a general medical unit in New Zealand. The Supportive and Palliative Care Indicators Tool was used to identify participants with advanced and progressive illness. Patients and family members were interviewed on recruitment and 3 – 4 months later. Four weeks of fieldwork were conducted in each site. A total of 40 interviews were conducted: 29 initial interviews and 11 follow-up interviews. Thematic analysis was undertaken. Field observations were undertaken in three sites: a residential care home, a medical assessment unit and Findings: perspectives on how such risks were managed. At home, patients tolerated increasing risk and used <b>specific</b> <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> to manage often escalating health and social problems. In contrast, decisions about discharge in hospital were driven by hospital staff who were risk-adverse. Availability of community and carer services supported risk management while a perceived need for early discharge decision making in hospital and making ‘safe’ discharge options informed hospital discharge decisions. Managing risk was an important factor that influenced transitions in care. Patients and health care staff held different Conclusion: with risk at the end of life. This requires reconsideration of transitional care and current discharge planning processes at the end of life.

40|$|Based on a 4 -year ethnographic {{study of}} conference interpreters {{working for the}} EU institutions’ {{interpreting}} services, the book describes conference interpreting as a practice, that is, the ‘lived work’ (Clancey 2006) of professionals. This approach builds {{on the idea that}} conference interpreters do not perform their job in isolation, but in a team with colleagues and in a wider social and organizational framework which shapes the conditions under which they work and the professional requirements put upon them. Its attention to the social and institutional embedding of conference interpreting also reflects recent developments in Translation Studies. These have resulted in an increased focus on interpreters as social agents and a new openness to interdisciplinary research (Pöchhacker 2009). The study was motivated by the gap that interpreter trainers and institutional recruiters observe between, on the one hand, the level of competence acquired by graduates who are successful in EU accreditation tests and, on the other hand, that which is needed to perform adequately in EU interpreting assignments. Drawing on documentary evidence, interview data and field notes resulting from observant participation of interpreters working for the interpreting services of the European Commission (DG SCIC) and the European Parliament (DG INTE), the book first describes how EU interpreters are employed by the interpreting DGs of the European Commission and the European Parliament in a highly institutionalized and complex environment. It demonstrates that, although they are divided into various subgroups along organizational (DG SCIC vs. DG INTE), administrative (ACIs/freelancers vs. officials) and linguistic (based on A-language) lines, the specific characteristics of their work context define them as a community of practice (Wenger 1998) with a joint professional mission. Both gate-keeping (accreditation tests and staff competitions) and quality standards are shown to be mainly managed by members of the community itself. Subsequently, a series of major distinctive features of EU interpreting work and their implications for the knowledge and skills required of practitioners are discussed. First, {{as a result of the}} EU’s policy of multilingualism, large language regimes are common in EU meetings. As these involve extensive recourse to retour and relay interpreting, insight in the implications of the information provided on the team sheet and proficiency in the interaction with the simultaneous interpreting equipment are indispensable for interpreters. Second, meeting types and subject fields vary across space (i. e. the working places and buildings of the various institutions served by the EU interpreting services) and time (i. e. according to institutional cycles). Under these conditions, it is essential not only to acquire familiarity with the material context, but also to develop the ability to recognize the links between the spatio-temporal situation and the characteristics of interpreting assignments. Third, within meetings, several meeting activities can be distinguished, each of them associated with specific types of interaction and discourse. For EU interpreters it is essential to be able to understand the implications of the meeting agenda, i. e. to link agenda items to various meeting activities in order to gauge the characteristics of the interpreting assignment. Fourth, both interpreting services have developed an array of dedicated ICT tools for advance consultation of meeting documents, terminology research, etc., which EU interpreters need to master. By examining the ways the EU interpreting DGs define categories of interpreter employees as ‘beginners’ and ‘newcomers’ and how the DGs regulate such employees’ eligibility for <b>specific</b> <b>support</b> <b>measures,</b> the study reveals how formal and informal arrangements contribute to creating or restricting individuals’ opportunities for situated learning. Drawing on interview and observational data reflecting differences in the skills and knowledge of beginning and experienced interpreters, it argues that interpreting competence is situated (i. e. bounded to a specific working context) and includes not only cognitive, but also embodied and social components. An examination of the opportunities for learning offered by participation in the practice shows that, for EU interpreters, situated learning is a necessary complement to formal conference interpreting training in that it allows them to become familiar with the shared repertoire of knowledge and skills required to cope with their task. Finally, the study demonstrates how the multidimensional concept of competence which emerges from a practice view contributes to a better understanding of the problems beginning interpreters face. A multimodal analysis of the way on-mic work is distributed among boothmates in a sample of EU meetings shows how Dutch booth interpreters draw on a complex of cognitive, social and embodied skills in order to apply shared professional and moral values in the course of an assignment. ...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the {{popularity}} of graph databases has grown rapidly. This paper focuses on single-graph as an effective model to represent information and its related graph mining techniques. In frequent pattern mining in a single-graph setting, {{there are two main}} problems: <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> and search scheme. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for constructing <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> that brings together existing minimum-image-based and overlap-graph-based <b>support</b> <b>measures.</b> Our framework is built on the concept of occurrence / instance hypergraphs. Based on that, we present two new support measures: minimum instance (MI) measure and minimum vertex cover (MVC) measure, that combine the advantages of existing measures. In particular, we show that the existing minimum-image-based <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> is an upper bound of the MI measure, which is also linear-time computable and results in counts that are close to number of instances of a pattern. Although the MVC measure is NP-hard, it can be approximated to a constant factor in polynomial time. We also provide polynomial-time relaxations for both measures and bounding theorems for all presented <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> in the hypergraph setting. We further show that the hypergraph-based framework can unify all <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> studied in this paper. This framework is also flexible in that more variants of <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> can be defined and profiled in it...|$|R
