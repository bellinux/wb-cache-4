40|$|Pigs (pipeline {{inspection}} gauges) {{are free}} moving piston-like devices, {{that are used}} for inspecting or cleaning pipelines in for example {{the oil and gas}} industry. Here they are used for onshore and offshore pipelines, where they are propelled by the production fluids. A better control of the velocity of the pig in the pipeline can be achieved by using so-called bypass pigs, which have an opening (bypass) that allows that some fluid passes by which reduces the pig velocity. A new development is a by-pass pig with speed control, in which the bypass area is adjusted when the pig moves through the pipeline to obtain a constant preset pig velocity. The goal of this research was to accurately describe the forces on a pig, with special emphasis on the friction between the pig and the pipe wall. Such a wall friction model can be used in pipeline simulation tools, that are used to prepare a pigging operation. The friction force is divided into two parts: (1) the normal force that the pig imposes on the pipeline wall (F_wall), and (2) the coefficient of friction (?) which converts F_wall to a friction force. F_wall is calculated by a non-linear finite element model for a 12 " <b>sealing</b> <b>disk</b> for a range of oversizes. A uniaxial tensile lab test was performed to fit the material coefficients used in the non-linear Mooney-Rivlin material model. It was shown that the results could be matched by a linear elastic analytical model with a correction factor Cor = 1. 45. An experiment was designed to measure both ? and F_wall for a range of pig disk oversizes. These values were measured for sealing disks with different thicknesses and made of different materials. The models were able to accurately describe the experiment results. Due to lubrication the coefficient of friction can drop by orders of magnitude. Lubrication can be described by the Reynolds equation for the fluid pressure of thin fluid films. The material of a pig that makes contact with the pipeline wall is deformed by this fluid pressure which can be described by soft elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory. To couple the linear elastic material of the <b>sealing</b> <b>disk</b> to the non-linear Reynolds equation, two numerical approaches were followed. Firstly, the linear elastic contact was described by a row of closely spaced linear springs. Secondly a lubrication model was made in which the linear elastic contact was described by the boundary element method. It was shown that these models give a good qualitative description of the lubrication behaviour. The model validation is left for future work. In addition, pressure drop measurements were performed in a flow loop for a model of the bypass pig. These measurements were compared with correlations from the literature.

40|$|For commercial, military, and {{aerospace}} applications, low-cost, small, reliable, and lightweight gas and liquid hermetically sealed valves with post initiation on/off capability are highly desirable for pressurized systems. Applications include remote fire suppression, single-use system-pressurization systems, spacecraft propellant systems, and in situ instruments. Current pyrotechnic- activated rupture disk hermetic valves {{were designed for}} physically larger systems and are heavy and integrate poorly with portable equipment, aircraft, and small spacecraft and instrument systems. Additionally, current pyrotechnically activated systems impart high g-force shock loads to surrounding components and structures, which {{increase the risk of}} damage and can require additional mitigation. The disclosed mechanism addresses the need for producing a hermetically sealed micro-isolation valve for low and high pressure for commercial, aerospace, and spacecraft applications. High-precision electrical discharge machining (EDM) parts allow for the machining of mated parts with gaps less than a thousandth of an inch. These high-precision parts are used to support against pressure and extrusion, a thin hermetically welded diaphragm. This diaphragm ruptures from a pressure differential when the support is removed and/or when the plunger is forced against the diaphragm. With the addition of conventional seals to the plunger and a two-way actuator, a derivative of this design would allow nonhermetic use as an on/off or metering valve after the initial rupturing of the hermetic <b>sealing</b> <b>disk.</b> In addition, in a single-use hermetically sealed isolation valve, the valve can be activated without the use of potential leak-inducing valve body penetrations. One implementation of this technology is a high-pressure, high-flow-rate rupture valve that is self-rupturing, which is advantageous for high-pressure applications such as gas isolation valves. Once initiated, this technology is self-energizing and requires low force compared to current pyrotechnic-based burst disk hermetic valves. This is a novel design for producing a single-use, self-rupturing, hermetically sealed valve for isolation of pressurized gas and/or liquids. This design can also be applied for single-use disposable valves for chemical instruments. A welded foil diaphragm is fully supported by two mated surfaces that are machined to micron accuracies using EDM. To open the valve, one of the surfaces is moved relative to the other to (a) remove the support creating an unsupported diaphragm that ruptures due to over pressure, and/or (b) produce tension in the diaphragm and rupture it...|$|E

The failure was extensive and took the dry air compressor off-line. Plant production was curtailed for several weeks. Initial investigation focused on the 1 st stage centrifugal compressor impeller and upstream dust filter. Most of the aluminum impeller was missing and portions of the air filter element had melted. With the sequence and cause unclear, a formal root cause analysis (RCA) was undertaken. The RCA process ultimately revealed that an unexpected thermite reaction occurred and consumed most of the aluminum impeller.

The experiments employed suspensions of outer segments of truncated, but physiologically functional, frog rods (OS-IS), intact isolated outer segments (intact OS), and leaky outer segments (leaky OS with a plasma membrane leaky to small solutes, but with <b>sealed</b> <b>disk</b> membranes). We observed the following. Intact OS or OS-IS isolated and purified in Percoll-Ringer's solution contained an average of 2. 2 mM total Ca 2 +, while leaky OS contained 2. 0 mM total Ca 2 +. This suggests {{that most of the}} Ca 2 + in OS-IS is contained inside OS disks. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors increased the Ca 2 + content to approximately 4. 2 mM in intact OS or OS-IS, whereas the Ca 2 + content of leaky OS was not altered. Na- Ca exchange was the dominant pathway for Ca 2 + efflux in both intact and leaky OS/OS-IS. The rate of Na-Ca exchange in intact OS/OS-IS was half- maximal between 30 and 50 mM Na+; at 50 mM Na+, this amounted to 5. 8 X 10 (7) Ca 2 +/OS X s or 0. 05 mM total Ca 2 +/s. This is much larger than the Ca 2 + component of the dark current. Other alkali cations could not replace Na+ in Na-Ca exchange in either OS-IS or leaky OS. They inhibited the rate of Na-Ca exchange (K {{greater than or equal to}} Rb greater than Cs greater than or equal to Li greater than TMA) and, as the inhibition became greater, a delay developed in the onset of Na-Ca exchange. The inhibition of Na-Ca exchange by alkali cations correlates with the prolonged duration of the photoresponse induced by these cations (Hodgkin, A. L., P. A. McNaughton, and B. J. Nunn. 1985. Journal of Physiology. 358 : 447 - 468). In addition to Na-Ca exchange, disk membranes in leaky OS showed a second pathway of Ca 2 + transport activated by cyclic GMP (cGMP). The cGMP-activated pathway required the presence of alkali cations and had a maximal rate of 9. 7 X 10 (6) Ca 2 +/OS X s. cGMP caused the release of only 30 % of the total Ca 2 + from leaky OS. The rate of Na-Ca exchange in leaky OS amounted to 1. 9 X 10 (7) Ca 2 +/OS X s. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R

A dual-burst disk design was chosen for primary investigation for systems involving separation of gases of two significantly different pressures. The two disks are used to seal either end of a piston cavity that has a different cross-sectional area on each side. Different piston surface areas are used to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium, P{sub 1 }A{sub 1 } = P{sub 2 }A{sub 2 }. The single-use valve functions when the downstream pressure is reduced to approximately atmospheric pressure, creating a pressure differential that causes the burst disks to fail. Several parameters were studied to determine the optimum design of the burst disk. These parameters include thickness, diameter, area/pressure ratio, scoring, and disk geometry. The disk material was limited to 304 L stainless steel. Factors that were considered essential to the optimization of the design were robustness, manufacturability, and burst pressure variability. The thicknesses of the disks that were studied range from 0. 003 in. to 0. 010 in. A model for predicting burst pressures of the burst disks was derived.

The two machines are similar and this paper concentrates on the turbine driving the cracked gas compressors. Both turbines {{had a history of}} high vibration, short bearing life, and unusual sensitivity to thermal changes and imbalance due to operation near the second critical speed. In addition, numerous blade failures had occurred. When additional turbine performance was required, a complete review of the entire turbine including the blade designs, rotordynarnics, and governor operation was commissioned. The performance upgrade included new blading, <b>disks,</b> <b>seals,</b> and other changes to the steam path. A turning gear was added for slow-roll operation to relieve thermal effects and rotor bow. A technique was developed for mounting the turbine disks on the rotor to minimize axial disk runout and local couple imbalances. The high bearing temperatures and high vibration issues were addressed with changes in shaft and bearing designs. A submerged arc welding process increased the governor end journal diameter from 51 / 4 inches to 7 inches. A rotordynamic optimization analysis resulted in replacing the tilting pad bearing on the governor end with an offset-half lobed journal bearing. The tilting pad bearings on the exhaust end of the turbines were retained but redesigned for optimum performance. Interchangeability of bearings between the two machines was maintained. These shaft and bearing changes resulted in a significant reduction in babbitt temperature, shaft vibration, and imbalance sensitivity as well as control of the second critical speed. The interaction of the rotor with the foundation substructure was found to be significant, and its inclusion in the analysis was required to properly design the optimized bearings. The blade design changes and steam path changes produced a more reliable design and greater than the required extra power. The addition of a turning gear drive has eliminated the thermal bow problems. A new electronic governor system has eliminated the wear associated with the original hydraulic governor.

Accordingly, it is extremely important to develop and improve the seal technology by investigating the gap flow.

Firstly, the overview of previous researches on labyrinth <b>seal,</b> rotating <b>disk</b> flow and Taylor-Couette flow are summarized. Labyrinth seals are the primary type of seals for turbo machinery. However, most researchers studied it for compressible flow only. It is also found that the enclosed rotating disk flow with through-flow can be studied instead of the gap flow in a hydraulic machine. Furthermore, the above mentioned annular gap flow is similar to the Taylor-Couette flow. The Taylor-vortices are formed in the annular gap due to the rotation of disk, which could be used as a resistance of flow. Therefore, in the present work, three parts are investigated. The first part is the investigation of the labyrinth seal for Francis turbines. The second part is the investigation of the gap flow between two stationary walls. The third part is investigation of the annular gap flow between one stationary and one rotating wall, based on the theory of Taylor-Couette flow. Afterwards, the theoretical formulas for leakage flow of a traditional labyrinth seal used in high head Francis turbine is derived and is verified to give acceptable results. The theoretical model is useful to predict the leakage flow by the measurements of Francis turbine at the Åbjøra Power plant. For straight-through labyrinth seal, the effects of cavity dimensions, numbers and locations on the leakage flow are investigated numerically. Smaller cavity depth, longer cavity length and fewer cavity numbers are required in order to reduce leakage loss. Furthermore, the straight-through labyrinth seal with the bilateral cavity produce less leakage loss than with the unilateral cavity given identical cavity dimensions. However, the cavity location has only slight influences on the leakage flow. In addition, it is proven via experiments that the leakage flow rate is proportional to the clearance gap and pressure difference. It is also found numerically that vortices are formed when the flow enters a bigger cross section. These vortices consume the kinetic energy to a large extent, thereby reducing the leakage flow. Lastly, the experimental set-up of the rotor-stator system is built up as a simplification of a Francis turbine runner in the Waterpower laboratory at NTNU for two purposes. One is to investigate how the rotational speed of smooth disk affects the leakage flow rate, and the other is to study what are the effects of the geometries of rotating disk on the leakage flow rate and disk friction torque. With dimensional analysis, the function of flow coefficient and friction coefficient for the gap flow between one stationary and one rotating wall is derived. From the measurements for the smooth disk (SD), it is found that the leakage loss can be reduced by increasing the rotational speed due to the dominance of flow coefficient. While the leakage flow rises up due to the dominated pressure difference between the above and below the rotating disk. Comparing the measurements of the smooth disk (SD) and the disk with straight grooves (DSG), it is revealed that the geometry of the rotating disk has an impact on the leakage flow, and the performance of DSG is better than SD. Stage I only exists during the range of the current testing for DSG. However, the geometry of the disk has only slight effects on the disk friction torque.

40|$|In this thesis, {{manufacturing}} of microirradiators, electrodeposition {{of radioactive}} {{elements such as}} Ni- 63, and applications of these radioactive sources are discussed. Ni- 63 has a half life of 100 years and a low energy beta electron of 67 keV, ideal for low dose low linear energy transfer (LET) research. The main focus of the research is on the novel Ni- 63 microirradiator. It contains {{a small amount of}} total activity of radiation but a large flux, allowing the user to safely handle the microirradiator without extensive shielding. This thesis is divided into nine chapters. Properties of microirradiators and various competing radioactive sources are compared in the introduction (chapter 1). Detailed description of manufacturing Ni- 63 microirradiator using the microelectrode as the starting point is outlined in chapter 2. The microelectrode is a 25 µm in diameter Pt <b>disk</b> <b>sealed</b> in a pulled 1 mm diameter borosilicate capillary tube, as a protruding wire or recessed disk microelectrode. The electrochemically active surface area of each is verified by cyclic voltammetry. Electrodeposition of nickel with a detailed description of formulation of the electrochemical bath in a cold "non-radioactive setting" was optimized by using parameters as defined by pourbaix diagrams, radioactive electroplating of Ni- 63, and incorporation of safety regulations into electrodeposition. Calibration and characterization of the Ni- 63 microirradiators as protruding wire and recessed disk microirradiators is presented in chapter 3. In chapters 4 through 6, applications of the Ni- 63 microirradiators and wire sources are presented. Chapter 4 provides a radiobiological application of the recessed disk microirradiator and a modified flush microirradiator with osteosarcoma cancer cells. Cells were irradiated with 2000 to 1 Bq, and real time observations of DNA double strand breaks were observed. A novel benchtop detection system for the microirradiators is presented in chapter 5. Ni- 63 is most commonly measured by liquid scintillation counters, which are expensive and not easily accessible within a benchtop setting. Results show liquid scintillation measurements overestimates the amount of radiation coming from the recessed disk. A novel 10 µCi Ni- 63 electrochemically deposited wire acting as an ambient chemical ionization source for pharmaceutical tablets in mass spectrometry is in chapter 6. Typically, larger radioactive sources (15 mCi) of Ni- 63 have been used in an ambient ionization scenario. Additionally, this is the first application of using Ni- 63 to ionize in atmosphere pharmaceutical tablets, leading to a possible field portable device. In the last chapters, chapters 7 through 8, previous microirradiator experiments and future work are summarized. Chapter 7 illustrates the prototype of the electrochemically deposited microirradiator, the Te- 125 microirradiator. In conjunction with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Te- 125 m is a low dose x-ray emitting element determined to be the best first prototype of an electrochemically deposited microirradiator. Manufacturing, characterization, and experiments that were not successful leading {{to the development of the}} Ni- 63 microirradiator are discussed. In chapter 8, future work is entailed in continuing on with this thesis project. The work presented in the thesis is concluded in chapter 9. Ph. D.

40|$|The hydroacoustic nuclear {{explosion}} monitoring regime, like it's {{counterpart in}} seismic monitoring, requires ground truth calibration. Model predictions of traveltimes, blockages, reflections, diffractions, and waveform envelopes {{need to be}} verified with ground truth experiments, particularly in the high latitudes where models often fail. Although pressure detonated explosives are a simple, reliable, and flexible method to generate an impulsive hydroacoustic calibration source at a desired depth; safety procedures, specialized training, and local regulations often preclude their use. This leaves few alternatives since airgun and other seismic marine sources are designed for use only at shallow depths and hence do not effectively couple into the SOFAR channel, a necessary requirement for long range propagation. Imploding spheres could be an effective source at mid-ocean depths and below but development of a method to reliably break such spheres has been elusive. We designed and tested a prototype system to initiate catastrophic glass sphere failure at a prescribed depth. The system firmly holds a glass sphere in contact with a piston-ram assembly. The end cap on the cylinder confining the piston and opposing the ram has a rupture <b>disk</b> <b>sealed</b> to it. The rupture disk is calibrated to fail within 5 % of the calibrated failure pressure, 1000 psi in our tests. Failure of the rupture disk results in a sudden inrush of high pressure water into the air-filled piston chamber, driving the piston [...] and attached ram [...] towards the glass sphere. The spherecracker was first tested on Benthos Corp. flotation spheres. The spherecracker mechanism successfully punched {{a hole in the}} Benthos sphere at the nominal pressure of 1000 psi or at about 700 meters depth in each of four tests. Despite the violent inrush of high pressure water the spheres did not otherwise fail. We concluded that the Benthos spheres were too thick-walled to be used as an imploding source at nominal SOFAR channel depths (500 meters- 1200 meters in mid-latitudes). A much thinner walled sphere, a special order modification of a standard 22 liter laboratory boiling flask made by the Kontes Glass Company, was also tested and found to fail in the desired manner, i. e. catastrophically. A test off the coast of California successfully initiated implosion of a Kontes sphere at 685 meters depth. The recorded signal showed a peak pressure slightly larger than that from 1 lb of high explosive detonated at the same depth. The signal spectra showed relatively broad band higher frequency energy with little signal below about 50 Hz and a broad peak in the amplitude spectra between about 200 and 800 Hz, similar to that from an explosive source detonated at the same depth. Although additional testing and development is needed, an imploding sphere source for hydroacoustic calibrations appears viable. Since the source spectra frequencies are generally higher than the frequency band used for nuclear explosion monitoring, low frequency signals (1 - 50 Hz) will be absent from the implosion source spectra. Calibration will have to be accomplished with frequencies above 50 Hz unless larger spheres, multiple spheres, or shallower implosion depths are used...|$|R
40|$|When a free falling object {{enters a}} free surface of water, it may go through four {{successive}} phases: impact, flow {{separation from the}} body surface, creation and pinch-off of the cavity above the body, and oscillation of cavity after the pinch-off. These phenomena have direct relevance to the effective design of freefall lifeboats. To understand such phenomena, numerical, theoretical and experimental methods are developed/conducted for the water entry of a free-falling wedge, which characterizes the bow section of a lifeboat. The present work focuses on {{the motion of the}} wedge and the dynamics of the cavity created {{on the top of the}} wedge and the influence of the cavity on the motion of the wedge. Non-linear boundary element methods were developed for simulating the water entry of the freefall wedge with and without the effect of air flow. It was found that the air flow starts to play an important role just before the closure of the cavity and the influence of air flow is limited due to the short duration. Numerical simulations showed that the initial entry speed of the wedge has a negligible influence on the closure period and the size of the cavity, but a significant influence on the submergence depth of the wedge at the closure of the cavity. The mass of the wedge strongly influences the formation and closure of cavities. A cavity will not be formed for light wedges. The cavity size is highly dependent on the mass. A larger mass leads to a larger cavity. The submergence depth at the closure of the cavity increases nearly linearly with mass, but the cavity closure period seems to be independent of the mass of the wedge. The influence of the deadrise angle was also investigated and it was found that the deadrise angle of the wedge has a weak influence on the formation and closure of cavities. Theoretical models were proposed to analyze the motions and cavity dynamics of free falling wedges entering the water surface. The theoretical model successfully predicted the peak acceleration and the evolution of submergence depth and velocity during the water entry of freefall wedges. It was revealed that slamming will significantly reduce the velocity of a light wedge, and there exists a critical initial entry velocity. If the initial velocity of wedge is less than the critical velocity, the velocity of wedge will increase after slamming phase; otherwise it will decrease. The theoretical models explained why the characteristics of the transient cavity, such as the nondimensional pinch-off (closure) time, pinch-off depth and wedge depth at pinch-off, scale roughly linearly as the Froude number (the dimensional pinch-off time is independent of the initial entry speed of the wedge, which is consistent with the finding of numerical simulations). The transient drag coefficients during the collapse phase of the cavity are extensively studied. It was found that for the light wedge the transient drag coefficients have slow variation in the first half stage and rapid variation in the last half stage, which is due to the fact that the hydrostatic force is the dominant component in the drag force at the last half stage for the light wedge. For the heavy wedge the transient drag coefficients vary slowly during the whole stage and can be treated as constant. The cavity closure point was found to move to the deeper water zone with increasing Froude number. This is opposite of the cavity seal mechanism from deep seal to surface <b>seal</b> for circular <b>disks</b> or spheres entering the water. The proposed numerical models and theoretical models were validated by experiments. The experiments also investigated the evolutions of the global hydrodynamic loads, the pressure on the impact side of the wedge, the air-water interface, and the cavity pressure after pinch-off. A typical evolution of the global hydrodynamic loads is found to be: rapid growth during slamming, rapid drop due to flow separation, slow variation during the formation of cavity and oscillation after the closure of cavity. The oscillation of the cavity pressure after pinch-off is a complex phenomenon. The oscillation frequency is related to the shape of the cavity, the mass of the wedge and the shape of the water surface, and the boundary conditions. The air leakage, thermal conductivity, and shear viscosity play important roles during the evolution of the closed cavity and directly affect the damping of the cavity pressure. As a first approximation, it can be assumed that the closed cavity has a uniform pressure field and follows an adiabatic process. PhD i marin teknikkPhD in Marine Technolog...|$|R
