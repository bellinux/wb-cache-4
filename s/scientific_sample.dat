40|$|This report {{presents}} {{results from}} an empirical {{investigation of the}} behavior of the replication and Iinearization techniques for measuring variance. The study utilizes data collected in the Health Interview Survey. Most <b>scientific</b> <b>sample</b> surveys are based on complex multistage probability designs, with design components that include unequal probabilities of selection of elements in the population, stratification, and several stages of clustering. The estimation procedures usually involve nonresponse and poststratification adjustments. These actions cause concern in the methods of estimation of standard errors and their subsequent use in constructing confidence intervals and testing hypotheses. There are several ways to study the characteristics of variance estimates. The method in this report is an empirical investigation. Data that were collected in a national sample survey become the universe and repeated samples are drawn from it. For each sample the statistics under study were calculated and sampling distributions of the estimates were generated. The material in this report was taken, in part, from Dr. Bean&#x 2019;s doctoral dissertation. [by Judy A. Bean]Includes bibliographical references...|$|E

40|$|Future {{missions}} to Mars will place {{heavy emphasis on}} <b>scientific</b> <b>sample</b> and return operations, which will require a rover to revisit sites of interest. Visual Teach and Repeat (VT&R) {{has proven to be}} an effective method to enable autonomous repeating of any previously driven route without a global positioning system. However, one of the major challenges in recognizing previously visited locations is lighting change, as this can drastically change the appearance of the scene. In an effort to achieve lighting invariance, this thesis details the design of a VT&R system that uses a laser scanner as the primary sensor. The key novelty is to apply appearance-based vision techniques traditionally used with camera systems to laser intensity images for motion estimation. Field tests were conducted in an outdoor environment over an entire diurnal cycle, covering more than 11 km with an autonomy rate of 99. 7 % by distance. ii Acknowledgements I owe my entire academic career as a researcher to Professor Timothy Barfoot —my super-visor and mentor.

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of bright new deposits in two crater gullies on Mars suggests that water still flows in brief spurts on Mars. In this paper, we {{will present the}} Axel rover (Figure 1) that was developed to access and sample such deposits {{on the inside of}} steep crater walls. Axel is a tethered rover that can be a payload on a lander or a larger rover. The primary features of Axel are its minimal complexity and robustness to the treacherous terrain of sites that are of scientific interest. Using a symmetrical design with three actuators, Axel is capable of operating upside down and right side up, enabling it to descend over crater promontories. With its actuated trailing link, Axel can operate on both flat and sloped terrains. Using a sampling device mounted on the trailing link, Axel can collect and store terrain samples and return to its host platform for detailed <b>scientific</b> <b>sample</b> analysis. We will present our preliminary results that demonstrated Axel's ability to traverse both flat and sloped rocky terrain including 90 ° vertical cliffs and collecting soil samples on slopes ranging from 10 ° - 40 ° in the JPL Mars Yard...|$|E
40|$|This {{new report}} by Jean Johnson about recent citizen {{deliberations}} {{on the debt}} suggest the seeds of consensus on how to tackle the problem, but warns that deep cynicism about Washington makes many Americans question whether elected officials will act, and whether they can be trusted to act.

40|$|Exploration to all {{destinations}} has {{at one time}} or another involved the acquisition and return of samples and context data. Gathered at the summit of the highest mountain, the floor of the deepest sea, or the ice of a polar surface, samples and their value (both scientific and symbolic) have been a mainstay of Earthly exploration. In manned spaceflight exploration, the gathering of samples and their contextual information has continued. With the extension of collecting activities to spaceflight destinations comes the need for geology tools and equipment uniquely designed for use by suited crew members in radically different environments from conventional field geology. Beginning with the first Apollo Lunar Surface Extravehicular Activity (EVA), EVA Geology Tools were successfully used to enable the exploration and <b>scientific</b> <b>sample</b> gathering objectives of the lunar crew members. These early designs were a step in the evolution of Field Geology equipment, and the evolution continues today. Contemporary efforts seek to build upon and extend the knowledge gained in not only the Apollo program but a wealth of terrestrial field geology methods and hardware that have continued to evolve since the last lunar surface EVA. This paper is presented with intentional focus on documenting the continuing evolution and growing body of knowledge for both engineering and science team members seeking to further the development of EVA Geology. Recent engineering development and field testing efforts of EVA Geology equipment for surface EVA applications are presented, including the 2010 Desert Research and Technology Studies (Desert RATs) field trial.

40|$|Longitudinal studies {{examining}} socio-demographic and other contextual factors {{are vital to}} understanding landscape change. Landscape structure, function, and change are assessed for the northern Ecuadorian Amazon by examining the composition and spatial organization of deforestation, agricultural extensification, and secondary plant succession at the farm level in 1990 and 1999 through the integration of data from a satellite time-series, a longitudinal household survey, and GIS coverages. Pattern metrics were calculated at the farm level through the generation of a hybrid land use and land cover (LULC) digital classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. Population, labor, and other household variables were generated from a <b>scientific</b> <b>sample</b> of survey farms or fincas interviewed in 1990 and resurveyed in 1999. Topography, soils, and distance and geographic accessibility measures were derived for sample farms through a GIS as well as qualitative assessments from household surveys. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were generated for 155 and 157 fincas in 1990 and 1999, respectively, using pattern metrics at the landscape level as dependent variables, and biophysical, geographical, and socio-economic/demographic variables as independent variables. The models were derived to explore {{the changing nature of}} LULC at the finca level by assessing the variation in the spatial structure or organization of farm landscapes in 1990 and 1999, {{and the extent to which}} this variation could be explained by the available data. Results indicate rapid population growth causing substantial subdivision of plots, which in turn has created a more complex and fragmented landscape in 1999 than in 1990. Key factors predicting landscape complexity are population size and composition, plot fragmentation through subdivision, expansion of the road and electrical networks, age of the plot (1990 only), and topography. The research demonstrates that the process of combining data from household surveys, satellite time-series images, and GIS coverages provide an ideal framework to examine population–environment interactions and that the statistical models presented are powerful tools to combine such data in an integrated way...|$|E
