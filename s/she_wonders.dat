5|$|At the {{appointed}} hour, Duchess appears at Ribby's {{door and the}} party begins. Distracted for a moment, Duchess does not see which oven Ribby opens to remove the pie. Duchess eats greedily, believing she is eating her ham and veal pie. <b>She</b> <b>wonders</b> {{what has happened to}} the patty-pan she put in her pie, and, not finding it under the crust, is convinced she has swallowed it. She sets up a howl; Ribby is perplexed and annoyed but leaves to find Dr. Maggoty, a magpie.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) brings Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{along to}} a dinner party hosted by his friend Gavin Volure (Steve Martin). Gavin becomes {{intrigued}} by Liz and invites her to spend the weekend with him, which she accepts. <b>She</b> <b>wonders</b> how the relationship between them will work, as he is agoraphobic. Gavin explains his daily routines to Liz, and also discloses that due to his phobias, he cannot be intimate with women. Liz starts to think that maybe a relationship with Gavin could work. As Liz gets ready to leave, Gavin admits {{to her that he}} is not agoraphobic, and that he is under house arrest for arson, fraud, embezzlement, and racketeering. This shocks Liz, and when she returns to New York, she tells Jack about it. Jack feels awful for investing NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) money with Gavin, after Gavin told him he was forming a new company and interested Jack to be part of it. Later, Gavin escapes from house arrest and shows up at the 30 Rock studios. There, he tells Liz that {{he was on his way}} to the Canada–US border but came back to bring her with him. After Liz refuses to go with him, and not wanting to go to prison, Gavin climbs to the top of the TGS with Tracy Jordan set and threatens to jump. Jack tries to talk Gavin out of jumping, distracting him in the process, resulting in Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tackling Gavin down.|$|E
60|$|He sprang up, {{strode to}} her with a nervous step, {{smoothed}} her hand. <b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> if <b>she</b> ought to be offended by his caress. Then <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> if he liked her hat, the new Oriental turban of rose and silver brocade.|$|R
60|$|And then <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> {{that this}} should be so, seeing that she had still {{regarded}} Clara as being in all things a child; and as she thought further, <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> at her own fatuity, in that she had allowed herself to be so grossly deceived.|$|R

25|$|Why, <b>she</b> <b>wonders,</b> does it {{seem that}} she could give him {{anything}}, anything at all, and receive essentially the same response. What does he desire nothing, really, beyond what he's already got?...This, she reminds herself, is a virtue.|$|E
25|$|One {{day after}} school, {{a young girl}} named Kilala Reno stumbles across a boy {{sleeping}} in her yard. After thinking to herself {{he looks like a}} Prince, she tries to kiss him, thinking it will wake him up, just like a kiss wakes up Sleeping Beauty. He does wake but only to fall back asleep again. Kilala then carries him inside her house and watches over him sleeping as <b>she</b> <b>wonders</b> who he is and where he came from. As she's folding his coat, a small tiara falls out, which she tries on. To her surprise, she feels just like one of the Disney Princesses. Then, Rei wakes up and accuses her of stealing the tiara. She calls him the Thief instead, questioning how she would know if he didn't steal it first. Rei's servant, Valdou, runs in and unintentionally breaks up the fight.|$|E
500|$|Months {{later the}} Tramp is released. He {{goes to the}} girl's {{customary}} street corner {{but she is not}} there. We learn that the girlher sight restorednow has a successful flower shop with her grandmother.

500|$|Jacqui faces more horror from Danny {{when she}} is {{threatened}} at knife point to strip for him, scared for her life she complies. Speaking of Jacqui's sudden change of heart, Cooper states: [...] "He pulls out a knife. That changes the situation - the dynamic changes immediately. He could do something really horrible to her - it's not necessarily about killing someone, he could slash her face or anything. In a situation like that, your mind plays tricks as you wonder what someone could do to you." [...] Cooper has spoken of her feelings of responsibility to portray it correctly and stated [...] "I wanted to show how horrendous it was for Jacqui. <b>She</b> <b>wonders</b> whether she could die like this - all to protect her family…" ...|$|E
500|$|She {{appeared}} in Laawaris (1999) because {{she liked the}} subject and considered her role [...] "substantial", which Rediff.com, in turn, described as another preachy [...] "woman of substance", while criticising the film for its lack of originality: [...] "working a worked-to-death formula, [...] falls flat on its face. This {{was followed by the}} final feature she {{appeared in}} during the decade, Hum Tum Pe Marte Hain, in which she played the part of Devyani, the strict mother of a wealthy family. Subhash K. Jha called the film an [...] "embarrassment", critic Suparn Verma, in a scathing review, criticised Kapadia's performance, noting that she [...] "wears a permanent scowl" [...] throughout the film, and Bella Jaisinghani of The Indian Express, calling the film [...] "inconsequential", concluded her review writing that <b>she</b> <b>wonders</b> [...] "what made Dimple Kapadia do this to herself".|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Radar" [...] {{runs through}} a midtempo dance groove. Spears' vocals are auto tuned and {{accompanied}} by sonar pulses and a heavy usage of distorted synthesizers. The lyrics refer to an attraction between the protagonist and a man, while <b>she</b> <b>wonders</b> if he knows what she is feeling. [...] "Radar" [...] received mixed reviews from critics; some called {{it one of the}} highlights of Blackout, while others felt that it was over-produced and also criticized her vocals for being processed. In July 2008, [...] "Radar" [...] charted in the top forty of Ireland and New Zealand, and inside the top-ten in Sweden. After it was released as a single from Circus, the track performed poorly on the charts and did not manage to enter the top forty in most countries. However, it became her 21st hit on the US Billboards Pop Songs chart, the most for any artist of the decade.|$|E

500|$|The {{question}} of Adeline's virtue is similarly complicated. Although she is forgiving {{to the point}} of absurdity, she is often considered more of a dupe than a martyr. Some have compared her to Balzac's title character in Le Père Goriot, who sacrifices himself for his daughters. As Bellos puts it: [...] "Adeline's complicity with Hector certainly makes her more interesting as a literary character, but it undermines her role as the symbol of virtue in the novel." [...] This complicity reaches an apex when she unsuccessfully attempts to sell her affections to Crevel (who has since lost interest) in order to repay her husband's debts. Her flirtation with prostitution is sometimes considered more egregious than Valérie's overt extortion, since Adeline is soiling her own dignity in the service of Baron Hulot's infidelity. For the remainder of the novel, Adeline trembles uncontrollably, a sign of her weakness. Later, when she visits the singer Josépha (on whom her husband once doted), Adeline is struck by the splendor earned by a life of materialistic seduction. <b>She</b> <b>wonders</b> aloud if she is capable of providing the carnal pleasures Hulot seeks outside of their home.|$|E
500|$|... "Sparks Fly" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised Swift's vocals on [...] "Sparks Fly", commenting that her voice {{in such an}} upbeat song is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer. Rahul Prabhakar of The Oxonian Review considers it [...] "dopamine-infused, hair-whipping stuff". Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine calls the song [...] "the purest iteration of Swift’s template and repertoire", also saying that it [...] "could turn things around for Swift, as it’s perhaps the most perfectly constructed single in a career built on tracks that are marvels of pop production and songwriting." [...] He concluded by stating that the song [...] "proves how evocative those turns-of-phrase {{can be in the}} right context. To that end, “Sparks Fly” plays as a template as much as it does as a standalone single, and it’s a testament to everything Taylor Swift gets right." [...] Bobby Peacock of Roughstock claims that he gets [...] "a sense that Taylor is starting to experience a little [...] burnout at radio. Her songs drop like rocks once they peak, and she's currently 0 for 3 on hitting the top of the Billboard charts. While I don't think this song has that je ne sais quoi to get her another 'You Belong with Me'-level [...] hit, I still think that even a slightly lesser effort from her is a worthwhile listen." [...] Blake Boldt of Engine 145 praised Swift, saying [...] "Her infusion of individual lines with urgency (“Drop everything now,” she insists) and earnestness (“Take away the pain,” she pleads) are a tribute to her talent, {{not so much as a}} distinguished vocalist but as an excellent communicator. Each frazzled note is freighted with meaning. Should I stay or should I go now?, <b>she</b> <b>wonders,</b> [...] away the hours before he calls her again." [...] Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country claimed the song is [...] "just another one of those so-Swift tracks that continually toes the line between country and pop to create a genre that is 100% Taylor Swift." [...] Erin Thompson of Seattle Weekly stated he wasn't to [...] "hot on" [...] the song and compared the song to Swift's earlier works, [...] "Fearless", [...] "Hey Stephen", and [...] "Forever and Always", and stated that Swift [...] "puts in a line about standing in the rain in so many of her songs that I'm beginning to think she watches The Notebook every time she gets ready to sit down and write a song." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin considered it a bubbly tune along with Swift's song, [...] "Long Live".|$|E
2500|$|Although {{she feels}} {{as if she is}} the fulcrum, Agnes begins and ends the play on her musings of insanity. <b>She</b> <b>wonders</b> if she could just {{suddenly}} slip off into madness and what that would be like. <b>She</b> <b>wonders</b> what her husband would do if that happened. Would she be an embarrassment to him? Embarrassment is a very large issue with Agnes. She is easily embarrassed by her sister Claire, who Agnes believes has wasted her life and her potential. When Claire insists that she is not an alcoholic, Agnes states sarcastically, “that’s very nice.” Then she lists times that Claire has vomited, fallen down, and called from the club to have someone come and get her. She concludes this commentary with the words: “If we change for the worse with drink, we are an alcoholic.” ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> now how <b>she</b> {{could ever}} have looked with {{approval}} on her rash act. <b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> what demon of interference and meddling had possessed her, to make her blunder into people's lives, upsetting them. <b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> that <b>she</b> was allowed to go around loose. She was nothing more nor less than a menace to society. Here was an estimable young man, obviously the sort of young man who would {{always have to be}} assisted through life by his relatives, and she had deliberately egged him on to wreck his prospects. She blushed hotly as she remembered that mad wireless she had sent him from the boat.|$|R

2500|$|Bujold {{writes that}} her {{experience}} {{growing up with}} a world-famous father {{is reflected in the}} same experience that her characters (Miles, Fiametta) have of growing up {{in the shadow of a}} [...] "Great Man". [...] Having observed this tendency in both genders, <b>she</b> <b>wonders</b> why it is always called [...] "great man's son syndrome", and never [...] "great man's daughter's syndrome." [...] Her brother, an engineer like their father, helped provide technical details to support her writing of Falling Free.|$|E

2500|$|Sister Jude has a {{conversation}} with Dr. Arden (James Cromwell), the physician of the institution's medical unit. She has a strong distrust of him, mainly due to their differing ideologies based on religion and science, respectively. <b>She</b> <b>wonders</b> why all of the patients who recently disappeared had no family or friends, to which Arden contends that they all died and were cremated. Later, Dr. Arden secretly sedates Kit and vivisects him, extracting a metallic object from his neck that grows legs and flees while Kit has apparent flashbacks to alien abduction.|$|E

[...] Nate refuses to tell her but Blanche is determined to find out. [...] Aside from that mystery she is sure that Grace and Everett are trying to get hold or at least control of Mumsfield’s money because they have gone through all of Grace’s money.|$|E
