It is believed that brewer Jacob Byssing constructed a building at the site prior to his acquisition of the entire corner lot at No. 12-14 between 1689 and 1692. No. 12 was sold off in 1702. The current building was constructed in 1792 for brewer Mathias Rohde, who owned the site from 1785 until 1801, and it was then owned by his widow Christence Cathrine until 1804. [...] Lieutenant Colonel F. A. <b>Schleppegrell</b> (1792-1850) lived in the building from 1844 to 47. Minister of Internal Affairs Peter Georg Bang (1797-1861) lived in the building in 1849.|$|E
50|$|The {{course of}} the battle was largely {{affected}} by the difficult weather conditions, during which the battle was fought. Still, senior officers on both sides have since been criticized for their actions during the battle. On the Danish side Colonel Baggesen and general Flindt, who commanded the cavalry brigade, who insufficiently pursued the retreating Schleswig-Holsteinian army during the noon attack. Colonel Baggesen was criticized for his frantic messages to the command, {{following the death of}} F. A. <b>Schleppegrell,</b> which caused the flanking attack on the Schleswig-Holsteinians, that could have secured a major victory, was called off. General Flindt was criticized for what was perceived as a half-hearted pursuit of Schleswig-Holsteinian army. Had he pursued the enemy with greater vigor, the enemy could have suffered considerable losses. The criticism, however, is likely based on a good deal of hindsight. Overall the determining factor in the Danish victory, was the superiority of the Danish infantry in regards to morale and training.|$|E
50|$|About this time, {{the weather}} {{dramatically}} changed. The previous days of warm weather, was suddenly replaced by heavy mist and pouring rain, {{which made it}} almost impossible for the officers on both sides to maintain {{an overview of the}} battlefield and their forces. At 5 AM, the Schleswig-Holstein army took the initiative and two brigades counter-attacked the Danish troops at the village of Stolk and, around 6 AM, against the Danes in Isted city. At Stolk the Danish forces were pushed back in disarray and during the frenzied fighting, Danish General F. A. <b>Schleppegrell</b> fell. After their success at Stolk, the Schleswig-Holsteinian army continued their advance and attacked Isted town. The fighting soon devolved into house to house fighting. The Danish Division Reserve were sent forward, and around 7:45 AM the Danish forces managed to first stop, and then counter attack the Schleswig-Holsteinians. During the fighting the Danish Colonel Baggesen sent a series of alarming messages to General Krogh and his staff, which caused General Krogh to cancel an ongoing flanking maneuver west of the battlefield. By chance, the Schleswig-Holsteinian army had escaped an attack that would have surprised their troops at a critical time.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to teaching students to identify causal conjunctions (Williams et al. 2007) and CMPs (Achugar and <b>Schleppegrell</b> 2005; <b>Schleppegrell</b> et al. 2004), these data demonstrate that United States history teachers should also teach {{students how to}} identify and make meaning from CACs; CACs account for {{a large number of}} total causal constructions in United States history textbooks. In doing so, teachers will enable students to comprehend and create a wider variety of causal relationships.|$|E
30|$|Academic literacy, {{which is}} {{discipline}} specific, {{is not a}} new concept in the field of literacy education. From a socio-cultural perspective, the development of academic literacy takes place in specific academic content areas (Fang 2014; Gee 2007; Gibbons 2009; <b>Schleppegrell</b> 2004; Zwiers 2008). Thus, instructional practice that separates literacy development from academic content learning becomes problematic. Existing research has shown that adequate development of academic language and literacy skills is crucial for students’ school success (Fang 2012; <b>Schleppegrell</b> 2004; <b>Schleppegrell</b> and O’Hallaron 2011; Zwiers, 2008). Many scholars, noticing that achievement disparities between ELLs and non-ELLs stem from the lack of instructional focus on academic language, argue for the need to make the linguistic structures of academic language explicit to ELLs (e.g. August and Shanahan 2006; Fang 2012, 2014; Gibbons 2002, 2003; Wong and Snow 2000). From the perspective of teacher development, a practical question is how to guide teachers to systematically incorporate students’ academic language growth while teaching the specific academic content such as math, science, and social studies.|$|E
30|$|The studies {{exploring}} GM that {{adopt the}} notion of stratal model outnumber the studies that adopt {{the notion of}} semantic junction. These studies explore both language development and language education (Colombi 2006; Christie and Derewianka, 2008; Mohan & Beckett, 2001; Painter 2003; Ryshina–Pankova 2010; <b>Schleppegrell,</b> 2004; Torr & Simpson, 2003).|$|E
30|$|Unfortunately, these {{instructional}} strategies might not help all students access important causal connections between historical events. Reading researchers (e.g., Trabasso and van den Broek 1985; Trabasso et al. 1984; Warren et al. 1979) and linguists (e.g., Noordman and de Blijzer 2000; <b>Schleppegrell</b> and Achugar 2003; Veel and Coffin 1996) not only agree that causation {{is an important}} ordering concept for text comprehension but that variations on causal constructions impact readers’ mental representations of texts. In addition to neglecting instruction on (1) the impact of causal direction on comprehending historical texts (Noordman and de Blijzer 2000) and (2) the use of CMPs in history texts (Achugar and <b>Schleppegrell</b> 2005),a instructional studies also neglect to focus on implicit causal connections, such as CACs, that {{have been identified as}} troublesome for students’ comprehension of history texts (Fitzgerald 2012) in history texts. In order to help all students identify, comprehend, and create sophisticated causal connections, they must be instructed in the various ways that causation is constructed.|$|E
30|$|Following Systemic Functional Linguistics, once {{language}} learners have surpassed the intermediate proficiency plateau, {{they seem to}} follow parallel learning paths in subsequent acquisition stages regardless of the native language or languages involved (Halliday 1985; 1993; Colombi 2000, 2002, 2006; Colombi and <b>Schleppegrell</b> 2002; Christie 2002; <b>Schleppegrell</b> 2004; Achugar and Colombi 2008). Following Halliday (1993 : 109), at the intermediate proficiency level English L 1 learners are able to ‘generalize [and] to construe “common” terms’ through congruent, ‘common sense’ structures. At this stage, the same learners are able to both decode and produce non-metaphorical (in the grammatical sense) utterances. Such utterances are characterized by low levels of lexical density and a frequent use of coordinated constructions of the and then-type, as shown in (1). Focusing on adolescent English L 1 writing in Australia, (Christie (2002): 65) notes the absence of grammatical metaphors in ‘primary-age writers, [who] produce clauses that offer congruent realizations … it will be into the secondary years that noncongruent realizations appear’.|$|E

This study {{examines}} a teacher development program that utilizes a functional linguistic approach (Halliday 1976; Mohan 1986; <b>Schleppegrell</b> 2004, 2010) to equip the teachers with {{knowledge and skills}} for students’ academic language and literacy development and shows the impact of such a program {{as evidenced by the}} change in not only teachers’ beliefs, perceptions, and knowledge, but also their instructional practice in the reality of their everyday teaching.|$|E
3000|$|... aAlthough Achugar and <b>Schleppegrell</b> (2005) do {{not refer}} to the causal process verbs in their study as Causal Material Processes (CMPs), all of the verbs used in the more {{explicitly}} causal passages in this study realized material processes (e.g., forced and make). I use the term CMP throughout this paper to differentiate the more explicit material processes from the more implicit processes that construct causal asyndetic constructions (CACs), explained later in this study.|$|E
30|$|Textbooks express {{causation}} using {{a variety}} of explicit and implicit means. Authors frequently use CMPs and conjunctions to explicitly express causation (Achugar and <b>Schleppegrell</b> 2005). In addition, they also use CACs to imply causation (Fitzgerald 2012). This study demonstrates that CACs are used as frequently, if not more frequently, than CMPs and causal conjunctions in sample United States history textbooks. Such causation is signaled through the use of modality, mental processes, relational processes, and verbal processes.|$|E
30|$|The {{title of}} my study is ‘The role of {{grammatical}} metaphor {{in the development}} of advanced literacy in Spanish as a first, second, and heritage language’. So after addressing {{the first part of the}} title, namely, what the role of grammatical metaphor {{in the development of}} advanced literacy is, allow me now to turn to the second part, or the third issue to be investigated here, which are one and the same. The issue consists of the direction pointed to by the studies discussed so far regarding first versus second and heritage language acquisition at the advanced language level. But before we touch on this matter, let us keep in mind that the first attestations of grammatical metaphors are found in adolescent writing (Halliday 1993; Christie 2002). Other aspects to take into consideration are that grammatical metaphor is usually acquired institutionally (Halliday 1993; Christie 2002; <b>Schleppegrell</b> 2004; Colombi 2006), and that the phenomenon is the single most important linguistic construction to be found in formal registers, in part because it allows for the condensation of language (Halliday 1993; Colombi 2002, 2006; Colombi and <b>Schleppegrell</b> 2002; Christie 2002).|$|E

The field {{has come a long}} way since The Handbook was printed. Since then, a series of works have been published on academic language. These works include thought pieces and theoretical perspectives on the nature and acquisition of academic literacy (Zamel & Spack, 2008); discussions on different genres and features of school literacy (<b>Schleppegrell,</b> 2004); academic writing in a second language (Belcher & Braine, 1995); academic writing development among Generation 1. 5 students (Harklau, Losey, & Siegal, 1999); and descriptions of school and classroom frameworks that support the development of academic literacy by ELLs (Bunch, Abram, Lotan, & Valdés, 2001; <b>Schleppegrell</b> & Colombi, 2002). Building Academic Language: Essential Practices for Content Classrooms is one of the most recent contributions to the arena of academic language development, and is different from most other works in the area because of its practical nature. Like its predecessor, it is also writte...|$|E
30|$|Related to ELL {{education}} {{is the issue of}} systematic integration of language and content (Mohan 1986). Linguistic and cultural aspects make an obvious impact on a student’s language development and conceptual learning (de Jong and Harper 2005; Harper and de Jong 2004, 2009). Available studies have provided a strong argument for culturally responsive approaches to instruction (Cartledge and Kourea 2008; Garcia and Ortiz 2006), but a culturally responsive agenda with no emphasis on linguistically sensitive pedagogy will be insufficient in addressing the issue of culturally diverse students struggling in the use of mainstream linguistic resources for academic success (<b>Schleppegrell</b> 2004). Thus, a culturally responsive pedagogy with an emphasis on the linguistic aspect, specifically academic language, for successful schooling for all children is needed. Such an approach requires theory-informed and research-based instruction, and assessment strategies that make the connections between academic content and content specific English explicit for the students. While studies from the socio-cultural perspectives (de Jong and Harper 2005; Gee 2007; Halliday 1976; Huang 2004; Mohan 1986; <b>Schleppegrell</b> and de Oliveira 2006) convincingly argue for the effectiveness of systematic integration of language and content in instruction for diverse students, the literature is limited to successful methods for developing teachers to implement this instructional integration.|$|E
30|$|This {{research}} {{revealed that}} {{more attention to}} explicit language instruction increases teachers’ abilities to teach their content. Since research shows that teachers must know both content and the language used to realize content (<b>Schleppegrell</b> 2004; Gibbons 2009), we hope this study can provide some resources and ideas to assist teacher educators. Colleges of teacher education need to give higher priority to assure that all pre- and in-service programs develop teachers capable of designing appropriate instruction for linguistically diverse students struggling under traditional pedagogical practices that leave teachers feeling unprepared (Balderrama 2001; Darling-Hammond et al.|$|E
30|$|Despite {{calls for}} {{teachers}} to choose primary source texts to support history instruction, many teachers continue to use history textbooks as their primary instructional material (Nokes 2010), making textbooks a primary means by which students are exposed to causal constructions. Research indicates that students are exposed to both explicit forms of causation, including causal conjunctions and CMPs (Achugar and <b>Schleppegrell</b> 2005) as well as implicit forms, via cohesion and CACs (Fitzgerald 2011). Instructing students to explore the ways that each form works is important to their understanding of historical text.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to causal connectors, some verbs {{can also be}} used to explicitly realize causal relationships, such as cause and make. Unlike causal conjunctions that express causation between clauses, authors use CMPs to specify causal relationships within the clause structure, forming more densely constructed historical text that might be more difficult for students to comprehend. By examining verbs authors choose to realize specific processes, Achugar and <b>Schleppegrell</b> (2005) illustrate that causal connections can be made less explicit than if causal conjunctions were used, making an important case for exploring the various ways causation is expressed in history textbooks by looking beyond connectors.|$|E
30|$|Causal {{connections}} are semantically important for constructing and comprehending history (Achugar and <b>Schleppegrell</b> 2005; Carr 1961; Coffin 2004, 2006; Moss 2005); they explain why events occurred. Without causal connections, {{it would be}} difficult to discuss important abstract concepts such as power, privilege, agency, and authority because causal connections provide “an important ordering principle of human perception and human experience” (Noordman and de Blijzer 2000, p. 35) and especially for explaining the relationships between historical events (Novick 1988). Unfortunately, youth are usually taught history via textbooks (Nokes 2010), which often neglect making causal connections between historical events, favoring a chronological narrative (FitzGerald 1979).|$|E
30|$|According to Halliday (1993), <b>Schleppegrell</b> (2004), and Colombi (2006), non-congruent, {{abstract}} realizations, {{such as the}} grammatically metaphorical {{expressions of}} (2), are {{the single most important}} feature of advanced literacy. Through this kind of cross-coding, (Colombi (2006): 154) argues, ‘actions … can be talked about in more ‘material’ terms, as having occurred, as being available for modification and, most importantly, for movement in conceptual space as actors in their own right’. An important secondary effect of the presence of grammatical metaphors in any given message is that its lexical density—the incidence of more content, as opposed to functional, words within a clause—increases. And as a consequence of a higher lexical density, as (<b>Schleppegrell</b> (2004): 72) notes, ‘students have to process more ideas per clause’. Thus, the more grammatical metaphors a message bears, the more packed, and objective, the stream of information will be because the agents will generally be removed, as in the attack on the town and the removal of the treasures in (2). Had sentences in (2) been presented in isolation, one would have wondered: ‘The attack by whom? The removal by whom?’. As noted earlier, the packing of information that grammatical metaphors allow for is also achieved by combining two or more coordinated clauses, as (1) illustrates, into a single sentence, as in (2). In other words, hypotactic and paratactic constructions, which are typical of oral language, are rather expressed through main and embedded clauses in grammatically metaphorical expressions.|$|E
30|$|In {{the past}} decade, SFL, widely {{used as a}} {{theoretical}} foundation for language and literacy education in international settings, has gradually made {{its way into the}} American educational field, partially due to the great effort made by American scholars in the field of ESL education. Zwiers (2008) and Schleppegrell’s (2004) work on academic language development in school settings have drawn attention to linguistic resources that we use to construct meaning in contextualized ways. The essence of the recent studies in literacy education from the SFL perspective is an emphasis on integration of language/literacy and content (e.g. Huang and Mohan 2008; Fang 2012; <b>Schleppegrell</b> 1998, 2001, 2003, 2004).|$|E
30|$|This section {{summarized}} the research studies {{from the fields}} of language development and language education. In order to provide a broad picture regarding the application of GM theory, each study was summarized in relation to its aims, context, data, and findings. The majority of the studies presented in this section adopt the stratal model as the theoretical orientation using various references (Colombi 2006; Christie and Derewianka, 2008; Mohan & Beckett, 2001; Painter 2003; Ryshina–Pankova 2010; <b>Schleppegrell,</b> 2004; Torr & Simpson, 2003). There is only one study that used the semantic model as the theoretical orientation (Byrnes, 2009), and {{there is only one}} study that adopted both models to analyse GM development (Derewianka 2003 a).|$|E
30|$|Relevant studies {{range from}} {{uncovering}} {{the nature of}} science discourse and investigating science literacy in primary and secondary school (Halliday and Martin 1993), to raising teachers’ awareness about language challenges (<b>Schleppegrell</b> and de Oliveira 2006).

In all these studies, language is put “squarely in the centre of the picture” (149). The quest for the nature of language and learning is going to continue {{for a long time to}} come.|$|E
