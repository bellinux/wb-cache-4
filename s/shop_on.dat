Norman's shop, directly {{across the street from the}} London Hospital, was visited by a surgeon named Frederick Treves, who invited Merrick to be examined and photographed. Soon after Merrick's visits to the hospital, Tom Norman's shop was closed by the police, and Merrick's managers sent him to tour in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{for a new}} {{building}} on the site have gone through several generations.

There may have been blacksmiths in Whitemore from the mid-19th century. A blacksmith established a <b>shop</b> <b>on</b> the main road in 1895 that was, by 1900, the only blacksmith in the area.

5|$|The Café Royal, {{located at}} 68 Regent Street in the Quadrant, was opened in 1865 by Daniel Nicols {{and became an}} {{institution}} of London high society.

Wilde went ahead with the trial, which ultimately led to his own arrest and imprisonment. The present building, by Sir Reginald Blomfield, dates from 1928 and is Grade II listed.

5|$|The Elephant Man exhibit was {{moderately}} successful, {{and made}} money {{primarily from the}} sales of the autobiographical pamphlet.

The <b>shop</b> <b>on</b> Whitechapel Road was directly across the road from the London Hospital, an excellent location, as medical students and doctors visited the shop, curious to see Merrick. One visitor was a young house surgeon named Reginald Tuckett. Like his colleagues, Tuckett was intrigued by the Elephant Man's deformities and told his senior colleague Frederick Treves.|$|E
