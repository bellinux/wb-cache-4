5|$|Alizon Device, whose {{encounter}} with John Law had triggered {{the events leading}} up to the trials, was charged with causing harm by witchcraft. Uniquely among the accused, Alizon was confronted in court by her alleged victim, John Law. <b>She</b> <b>seems</b> to have genuinely believed in her own guilt; when Law was brought into court Alizon fell to her knees in tears and confessed. She was found guilty.|$|E
5|$|The scene changes again, now to bright {{daylight}} and blue sky. Two men are driving an old Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider passo corto down an empty road. As {{one of the}} men helps the girl up, she spreads her wings and he holds her hands while she gains confidence. With a nudge she is airborne, but <b>she</b> <b>seems</b> hesitant and afraid as he lets go.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Anders as Linda Katherine Zwordling: Linda is {{a tester}} {{in one of}} Veridian's departments. She finds herself very {{attracted}} to Ted, but maintains other relationships and reminds Ted repeatedly that he has rejected {{the idea of a}} workplace romance with her. <b>She</b> <b>seems</b> to be a bit of an outsider to the corporate culture. Often she demands that Ted consider the horrible ramifications of the company policies or activities. Her relationship with the scientists is strained by her rejection of the weird things they do in the name of science. Despite this, she finds herself increasingly looking at Veronica as a mentor as the series progresses.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>seemed</b> to {{know her}} way, and <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> to have a {{quantity}} of luggage.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>seemed</b> {{about to}} go on, but she stopped, and again he waited. At length <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> to force herself to speak.|$|R
60|$|He rose in {{the morning}} grey and unreal. And <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> fond of him again, <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> to make up to him a little.|$|R
5|$|Back on the ward, {{a father}} and his two daughters have been brought in, one with a stab wound and one badly burnt. The father only has minor {{injuries}} but the police seem to believe {{he had something to}} do with the incident. Maddy tries to find out what is happening from the father, who is not talking to the police. <b>She</b> <b>seems</b> to have some connection with him but can't seem to put her finger on what it is.|$|E
5|$|Portia de Rossi as Veronica Palmer: Veronica is Ted's {{boss and}} {{immediate}} supervisor at Veridian Dynamics. She maintains a fierce and unapproachable workplace demeanor, and many employees {{have a deep}} fear of her. <b>She</b> <b>seems</b> cold and calculating, {{but it is also}} clear that she has more than grudging respect for Ted, and often recognizes what moral action is necessary to maintain balance in the workplace. An ongoing subplot touched on sporadically in the first season but more frequently in the second sees Veronica becoming a mentor to Linda and, to a lesser degree, Rose.|$|E
5|$|Back in Azerbaijan, Bond {{discloses}} to M that Elektra {{may not be}} {{as innocent}} as <b>she</b> <b>seems.</b> An alarm sounds while he is handing M the locator card as proof of the theft, which reveals that the stolen bomb from Kazakhstan is attached to an inspection rig heading towards the oil terminal. Bond and Jones enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb, and Jones discovers that half of the plutonium is missing. They both jump clear of the rig, a large section of pipeline is destroyed, and they are presumed killed. Back at the command centre, Elektra reveals she and Renard are conspirators and that she killed her father as revenge for using her as bait for Renard. She abducts M, whom she resents for advising her father not to pay the ransom money, and imprisons her in the Maiden's Tower.|$|E
60|$|After Christmas, however, she {{had nothing}} at all to think forward to. And it was then <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> to shrink: <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> {{positively}} to shrink.|$|R
60|$|She {{was looking}} at him and talking at him, but <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> far aloof in the {{abstraction}} of a sublime regret; <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> puzzled, bewildered at herself.|$|R
60|$|Was she a girl? Sometimes <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> a woman--when {{her face}} sobered a moment--then again <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> a child. It was this change of {{expression}} that bewildered and fascinated him.|$|R
5|$|Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) revives {{the student}} {{newspaper}} The Muckraker. She wants to publish libel about the McKinley High glee club to cause {{conflict between the}} club's members and destroy it from within. Brittany's (Heather Morris) new internet talk show—"Fondue for Two"—gives the newspaper some grist when <b>she</b> <b>seems</b> to out Santana (Naya Rivera) on it. Santana berates Brittany for her ill-chosen words, and Finn (Cory Monteith) nearly comes to blows with Sam (Chord Overstreet) over another item that pairs Sam and Finn's girlfriend Quinn (Dianna Agron). Although Quinn and Sam both deny dating, Finn plans a stakeout with Rachel's help {{to see if it}} is true. Their surveillance of a shabby motel instead finds Sam and Kurt (Chris Colfer) leaving a room, after which Sam goes back inside alone.|$|E
5|$|Data {{is visiting}} D'Sora, but <b>she</b> <b>seems</b> unhappy {{and he is}} acting erratically {{in order to find}} an {{appropriate}} response to make her happy. It becomes evident to the crew that the nebula is causing distortions in space; Picard orders the ship into warp to leave the nebula as quickly as possible but this speeds up the distortions. Whilst investigating them, Lieutenant Van Mayter (Georgina Shore) is killed when a distortion embeds her into the deck. Data discovers that dark matter is causing the distortions. The ship can detect the pockets at short range, but not in enough time {{to move out of the}} way. Worf proposes using a shuttle to lead the Enterprise out, and Picard insists on piloting it alone.|$|E
5|$|In the B story, April (Aubrey Plaza) {{is working}} as Chris' (Rob Lowe) {{assistant}} until {{he goes back}} to Indianapolis. April's cynical personality clashes with Chris' relentless optimism and happiness. In an attempt to get fired, April purposely neglects to tell Ann (Rashida Jones) that Chris cannot make a lunch date. When Ann arrives to confront Chris, she quickly realizes April's ploy. Ann reveals she is very happy dating Chris, and would even probably move with him to Indianapolis if asked. Andy (Chris Pratt), who is still trying to win back April's affections, gives Chris an obviously forged letter from the FBI claiming April must immediately return to the parks department. Chris sees through the ruse and tells April she can go back, but that remaining his assistant may provide her career opportunities. He invites her to return with him to Indianapolis and <b>she</b> <b>seems</b> interested, leaving both Ann and Andy stunned and jealous.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Olive, I spoke because I thought <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to place}} more {{importance}} on Ben's {{belonging to the}} church than anything else, and <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> so surprised when I told her he didn't belong to any." ...|$|R
60|$|His interruptress {{stopped and}} looked at him again, as if she thought him a very odd person; but <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> amused. Now, at any rate, she was not frightened. <b>She</b> <b>seemed</b> even {{disposed}} to provoke him a little.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to think}} he would say {{something}} more, but {{he turned away from}} her, and after a little silence of expectance she let him go, with promises to come again, which <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> to win from him for his own sake.|$|R
5|$|Kaoru is the {{instructor}} of the Kamiya Kasshin martial-arts school. She inherited her fighting style {{and a small}} dojo from her father, who was drafted by a police swordsmen unit and died defending a comrade during the Seinan War. At {{the beginning of the}} story, Kaoru has no students and runs the dojo alone; <b>she</b> <b>seems</b> likely to lose it when Kenshin helps her. Despite occasional mood swings and a reputation for bad cooking, she is independent, compassionate, courageous and a good fighter. In her first appearance, Kaoru searches for the assassin Hitokiri Battosai, who claims to be from Kamiya Kasshin-ryu. Kaoru is saved by the real Battosai, Himura Kenshin, and invites him to her dojo.|$|E
5|$|Madonna looks both {{older and}} younger than she does in the photos and the videos: a little more lined and {{possibly}} tired, but also less mature and grand. Her manner is quite teenaged, not femme fatale. <b>She</b> <b>seems</b> up for mischief, and yet quite conscious of her power. At the same time, her very frankness is almost innocent. These combinations are odd, and they give her {{the air of a}} prematurely wise child. Her current style is 1930s Hollywood meets early 1970s flash: Jean Harlow and Angie Bowie. She is not bewitching, but is certainly beautiful. She wears the nose stud that so troubled Norman Mailer in a recent interview. If you saw her in the street, you'd think: she looks like a girl who looks a bit like Madonna.|$|E
5|$|The Fringe team discovers a Triad {{gang member}} and ties to several shell {{companies}} the gang {{has set up}} in the US. They interview Elizabeth Jarvis (Ingrid Torrance), one of the companies' large investors, but <b>she</b> <b>seems</b> unaware of her investment's criminal background. While at her house, Peter (Joshua Jackson) observes signs of obsessive compulsive and germaphobe characteristics such as large quantities of hand sanitizer. Walter informs him the worm has a medicinal purpose, not a narcotic one as they previously believed. These two discoveries lead Peter and Olivia (Anna Torv) back to Jarvis' house, and they learn that her son (Colby Paul) has an immunodeficiency disorder. To allow him {{to be able to go}} outside, his mother and doctor have been giving him an injection to his spleen once a month, though he is unaware of the medicine's origins.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wonderful!" [...] exclaimed {{the good}} lady in reply; and beyond this word <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> unable {{to go for}} a time, save that, after a strong mental effort, she varied it to [...] "amazing!" [...] Suddenly <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> to recover, and said with a quick, earnest look-- ...|$|R
60|$|I gave it up. <b>She</b> <b>seemed</b> {{thoroughly}} in earnest, and yet {{every word}} <b>she</b> spoke <b>seemed</b> contrary to my instinctive judgment of her. She {{pointed to the}} table.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very little. <b>She</b> <b>seemed</b> sympathetic, {{but after}} all {{she is in the}} enemy camp. <b>She</b> and Immelan <b>seemed</b> on {{particularly}} good terms." ...|$|R
25|$|She is Sunao's {{younger sister}} {{currently}} attending grade school. <b>She</b> <b>seems</b> {{to be more}} down-to-earth than her older sister.|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>seemed</b> the {{incarnation}} of girlish scorn and wilful passion.|$|R

25|$|Zora is {{a friend}} of Martha's and the landlady of a house that Yusei, Jack and Crow stay at in the third season. She gets annoyed by the {{disturbances}} of the crew's engineering, but <b>she</b> <b>seems</b> to have a soft side for Yusei.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to think}} that orchids {{originated}} in Covent Garden.|$|R
60|$|Her sister {{looked into}} her face, attentively. <b>She</b> <b>seemed</b> in doubt.|$|R
60|$|She laughed softly, but <b>she</b> <b>seemed,</b> even then, {{a little}} annoyed.|$|R
