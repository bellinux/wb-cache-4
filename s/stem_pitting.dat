5000|$|Aphids are {{the main}} vector by which CTV is {{transmit}}ted. Initially the United States only had the melon (cotton aphid) Aphis gossypii, spirea aphid Aphis spiraecola, and black citrus aphid Toxoptera aurantii. [...] These aphids transmit the virus much less efficiently than the brown citrus aphid Toxoptera citricida. Toxoptera citricida {{had been found in}} East Asia and South America, and had slowly made its way up through Central America and the Caribbean Islands. By 1993 it had reached Cuba, and in 1995 it was found in Florida. [...] The aphids require at least 30 to 60 minutes of feeding to acquire the virus, and remain viruliferous for at least 24 hours after. T. citricida is much more efficient than the other aphids, and it can transmit CTV strains causing severe <b>stem</b> <b>pitting</b> or decline that the other aphids cannot vector. Even though A. spiraecola is less efficient, it tends to have higher populations and thus can still transfer the virus fairly well. T. aurantii has been shown to only transmit certain strains of CTV. Of the three lesser efficient aphids, A. gossypii has a 78% transmission efficiency, while A. spiraecola and T. aurantii are between 0-6%. [...] The main cultural practice that increases the severity of the CTV is when the citrus trees are grafted onto the sour orange rootstock. Using CTV infected budwood for grafting can transfer the CTV from the original tree to the new one.|$|E
5000|$|When CTV {{was first}} {{discovered}} quarantine {{was the best}} management strategy, now quarantining only works for areas where {{a small amount of}} trees are infected. The other approach that was adopted after T. citricida came to the U.S. was destroying any tree in which the budwood was not free of CTV. [...] This is a more drastic measure but must be done due to how fast T. citricida can spread the virus. If there is any CTV in the area, avoid grafting trees on sour orange rootstock and instead graft on tristeza-tolerant rootstock. Since the virus has been in Asia a long time they have used rootstock from trifoliate orange, Sunki, and Shiikuwasha (C. depressa Hayata) for many years. Some hybrids, such as Troyer citrange or Swingle citromelo, show promise as resistant root-stock. Also, using scion varieties tolerant to <b>stem</b> <b>pitting</b> is recommended. The production of virus-free trees by shoot-tip grafting or heat treatment is very important. If it is possible to keep the field permanently free of CTV, the planting of virus-free trees is practical. In areas where it is difficult to find a virus-free field, preinoculation with a mild CTV strain protects trees against infection with a severe strain of CTV. Bud-stock trees should be inoculated with a mild CTV strain at least four to six months prior to propagation. They should then be kept in a greenhouse, under aphid-free conditions. It is also recommended that nurseries of young plants grown for propagation should be kept vector-free. Top-grafting with pre-inoculated buds onto interstock trees infested with severe CTV is not effective, because the tree has little protection against the disease. It is necessary to spray nursery plants and young trees with insecticide occasionally, to control aphids. This should retard any re-infection with the virus. A biological approach has been to bring in a parasitoid wasp from Asia that naturally controls A. spiraecola. This approach was stopped when T. citricida arrived due to it not being a parasite of the more important aphid. There is a natural parasite of aphids in Florida in the gall midge family Cecidomiidae that attempts to keep aphid levels down, however due to the influx in aphid population it {{has not been able to}} keep populations down.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Recent {{investigations}} {{indicate that}} several latent viruses of apples exist in common commercial apple stocks, but these viruses and their relationships are incompletely understood. This thesis describes investigations of crab apples {{as indicators of}} latent viruses of apples. Eighty-eight varieties and species of crab apples were tested as indicators of latent virus of apples. Seventeen reacted to a single source of inoculum white 71 remained symptomless. Of those that reacted, five gave a severe reaction, six gave a moderate reaction, and six gave a mild reaction to this inoculum. Twelve of the 17 reactors were selected and inoculated with five selected inocula. These inocula produced a similar range of symptoms on the 12 indicator varieties. These results suggested that the crab apples were sensitive to the same virus or viruses. The crab apples that reacted severely to the virus were often killed before sprouting and therefore the results were inconclusive. Delaying inoculation for 14 days after planting in the greenhouse allowed the plants to start growing and produce a more conclusive virus reaction. The species M. huphensis was the most sensitive indicator in these trials. This indicator was capable of detecting a virus present in normal-appearing Hopa crab appIe, another indicator of latent virus of commercial apples. The indicator M. huphensis is recommended as a preliminary screening host {{in the search for}} disease-free varieties. Using single virus isolates of Chlorotic Leaf Spot, Spy Lethal, <b>Stem</b> <b>Pit,</b> and Line Pattern viruses, evidence is presented to show that the virus causing the reaction on crab apples is not identical with any of the viruses named above. The Bartlett pear seedling 138, an indicator for Pear Mosaic virus, is recommended as a filtering plant for the virus causing the reaction on Hopa crab apple. This virus can be removed frorn a culture by inoculating donor buds of the culture onto the Bartlett pear seedling 138. Data are presented indicating that Pear Mosaic virus is not identical with Chlorotic Leaf Spot virus nor is it identical with the virus causing the reaction on Hopa crab, Chlorotic Leaf Spot virus cannot be suitably detected under the conditions described in these experiments. These tests were designed for a maximum length of 60 days, and Chlorotic Leaf Spot virus sometimes fails to cause symptoms on Russian seedling R 12740 - 7 A until two years after inoculation. Movement of a latent virus of apple was followed in a newly infected apple seedling. The rate of movement was rapid with most of the seedling invaded within seven weeks after inoculation in most cases. The pattern of movement within the seedling was not uniform. Tissues adjacent to the site of inoculation were often free of the virus while more distant tissues were readily invaded. Knowledge of latent viruses of apple is still confused, and extensive work is needed with many indicators to determine if many strains of a few viruses or many individual viruses are involved. The list of indicators for latent viruses of apple is not complete, but the crab apples {{are an important part of}} this list...|$|R

40|$|ATP synthase, the {{assembly}} which makes ATP in mitochondria, chloroplasts and bacteria, uses transmembrane proton gradients generated by respiration or photosynthesis {{to drive the}} phosphorylation of ADP. Its membrane domain is joined by a slender stalk to a peripheral catalytic domain, F 1 -ATPase. This domain is made of five subunits with stoichiometries of 3 alpha: 3 beta: 1 gamma: 1 delta: 1 epsilon, and in bovine mitochondria has a molecular mass of 371, 000. We have determined the 3 -dimensional structure of bovine mitochondrial F 1 -ATPase to 6. 5 A resolution by X-ray crystallography. It is an approximately spherical globule 110 A in diameter, on a 40 A stem which contains two alpha-helices in a coiled-coil.

40|$|The Upper Lias of Yorkshire as {{represented}} {{to the north}} and west of the Peak Fault, is a phase of aeposition of argillaceous sediments under varying physical conditions. The Grey Shales are shallow water deposits which pass gradually but rapidly into the finely laminated, bituminous shales of the Jet Rock, which were laid down under 'Black Sea conditions', but in water much shallower than the Black Sea. As the basin was gradually filled up during Bituminous Shale and Hard Shale times, its floor rose into the zone of aerated water, when the poorly bedded Alum Shales were deposited. Thes sedimentational conditions were interrupted by the deposition of an argillaceous limestone at the end of Jet Rock-times and by several beds and rows of masses of siderite mudstone, at varying horizons during subsequent zone-moments. The best 'hard' jet is found only in the Jet Rock, and is entirely composed of collapsed and compressed wood structures, soaked in humic substances resulting from the decomposition of the original wood. Annual rings, medullary rays, tracheids, bordered <b>pits,</b> <b>stem</b> bases and bark are all recognised in the jet. Some specimens of jet are silicified along a central zone, and here the wood structure is well preserved in an uncrushed state. Within the jet are frequent rows of included quartz grains and other minerals, which had become wedged into cracks in the wood before sedimentation. Whitby jet is the altered ermains of coniferous wood washed from the Liassic land surface into the Yorkshire Basin, where it became waterlogged and sank. The dominating factors in the subsequent jetonisation were the conditions of reduction and stagnation in the deeper parts of the basin during Jet Rock times. These conditions caused the formation of a fine, black viscous mud which, together with the absence of oxygen due to the same reason, controlled the decomposition of the wood and limited it to a unique and prolonged breakdown of organic constituents. As a result the wood which was in the form of stems and trunks, was reduced to a pulpy condition. The constant slow deposition of muds caused the stems to be much flattened and to assume the form in which they are now found. The inferior varieties of jet are due to formation in more oxygenated conditions of sedimentation, and probably to a greater degree of aerobic decomposition before incorporation in the argillaceous sediments. The increased amount of oxygen would cause decomposition to follow a more normal course...|$|R

40|$|Citrus {{tristeza}} virus (CTV) causes two citrus {{diseases that}} have caused devastating losses in global citrus production.

Both diseases continue to invade new areas. While quick decline could be effectively managed by the use of resistant and/or tolerant rootstocks, the only means to protect commercial citrus against endemic <b>stem</b> <b>pitting</b> isolates of CTV has been cross-protection with mild isolates of the virus. In some citrus areas cross-protection has been successful and allowed production of certain citrus cultivars despite the presence of severe <b>stem</b> <b>pitting</b> isolates in those regions.

In general, there has been no understanding why some mild isolates were effective and others failed to protect. We have been working on the mechanism of cross-protection by CTV. Recent considerable progress has significantly advanced our understanding of how cross-protection may work in the citrus/CTV pathosystem. As we demonstrated, only isolates that belong to the same strain of the virus cross protect against each other, while isolates from different strains do not. We believe that the results of our research could now make finding protecting isolates relatively straightforward. This review discusses some of the history of CTV cross-protection along with the recent findings and our ‘recipe’ for selection of protecting isolates...|$|E

40|$|<b>Stem</b> <b>pitting</b> is {{a common}} virus-induced disease of {{perennial}} woody plants induced by a range of different viruses. The phenotype results from sporadic areas of the stem in which normal xylem and phloem development is prevented during growth of stems. These alterations interfere with carbohydrate transport, resulting in reduced plant growth and yield. Citrus tristeza virus (CTV), a phloem-limited closterovirus, induces economically important stem-pitting diseases of citrus. CTV has three nonconserved genes (p 33, p 18, and p 13) that {{are not related to}} genes of other viruses and that are not required for systemic infection of some species of citrus, which allowed us to examine the effect of deletions of these genes on symptom phenotypes. In the most susceptible experimental host, Citrus macrophylla, the full-length virus causes only very mild stem-pitting symptoms. Surprisingly, we found that certain deletion combinations (p 33 and p 18 and/or p 13) induced greatly increased stem-pitting symptoms, while other combinations (p 13 or p 13 plus p 18) resulted in reduced <b>stem</b> <b>pitting.</b> These results suggest that the stem-pitting phenotype, which is one of more economically important disease phenotypes, can result not from a specific sequence or protein but from a balance between the expression of different viral genes. Unexpectedly, using green fluorescent protein-tagged full-length virus and deletion mutants (CTV 9 ∆p 33 and CTV 9 ∆p 33 ∆p 18 ∆p 13), the virus was found at pitted areas in abnormal locations outside the normal ring of phloem. Thus, increased <b>stem</b> <b>pitting</b> was associated not only with a prevention of xylem production but also with a proliferation of cells that supported viral replication, suggesting that at random areas of stems the virus can elicit changes in cellular differentiation and development...|$|E
40|$|Grapevine rupestris <b>stem</b> <b>pitting</b> {{associated}} virus (GRSPaV), is {{the putative}} causal agent of rupestris <b>stem</b> <b>pitting</b> (RSP) {{a component of}} the rugose wood disease of grapevine. Recently, a strikingly high association has been detected between GRSPaV and vein necrosis (VN), suggesting that 110 Richter (110 R) is the best indicator of GRSPaV infection. In the present study, we investigate the occurrence of molecular variants of GRSPaV in grapevine accessions previously indexed for vein necrosis on 110 R. 100 % of the VN infected accessions results positive to GRSPaV by RT-PCR using primers 13 / 14. Using group specific primers, group I was detected in all the 22 accessions infected with VN, 11 times in mix infection with group III, 3 times with group II, and twice as a single infection. Unexpected results were observed with group II, in fact this group is present in 6 accessions negative to VN and to GRSPaV with primers 13 / 14. No single infection was, however, recorded for group III, the only available indication is its exclusive presence in VN infected accessions. This work confirms the association between GRSPaV and vein necrosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{unavailability}} {{of adequate}} immunological reagents has prevented {{the use of}} ELISA for the diagnosis of rupestris <b>stem</b> <b>pitting</b> disorder of grapevines. In this work, the performance of five primer pairs for broad-scale detection of rupestris <b>stem</b> <b>pitting</b> associated virus- 1 by RT-PCR using ds-RNA templates was compared and contrasted with biological indexing. The virus was widespread among the budwood of 35 Portuguese grapevine varieties assayed, with a prevalence of 85 %. The biological assay proved to be unreliable as an index of infection due to {{the high number of}} false negatives. Five sets of primers were assayed and compared by means of their relative sensitivity and negative predictive value. The primer pair specific for the coat protein gene was excluded because of the difficulty in identifying the specific amplified product. From the other four primer pairs, those specific for the helicase domain of the putative polymerase gene had the highest sensitivity and negative predictive value. However, a high confidence in the assay, as desirable for a certification scheme, could not be obtained by the sole use of this primer pair. An additional pair should be used in a separate or in a multiplex RT-PCR reaction...|$|E

Syndromes and symptoms expression depend on the interactions of factors involved in the pathosystem, host-strain-rootstock-climate-vector. Several strains of CTV have been studied all over the world.

GRSPaV is commonly detected in cultivated grapevine worldwide. The hypothesis of co evolution between the ancestor of GRSPaV and Vitis species associated to its diffusion in scion varieties via the grafting was previously proposed (Meng et al., 2006). To test this hypothesis we investigated the GRSPaV infection of numerous grapevine accessions never grafted...|$|E
40|$|Citrus {{tristeza}} virus (CTV) isolates from 35 grapefruit accessions {{belonging to}} Citrus Active Germplasm Bank of the "Instituto Agronômico de Campinas" {{located at the}} "Centro APTA Citros Sylvio Moreira", Cordeirópolis, São Paulo state, Brazil, were characterized and evaluated through symptoms in the trees, biological indexing, immunological diagnosis with different monoclonal antibodies and SSCP analysis (single-strand conformation polymorphism) of the coat protein gene. Symptomatology indicated that, in general, the group of plants with smaller canopy volume and severe <b>stem</b> <b>pitting</b> differed significantly from the group that presented greater vegetative development and mild to moderate <b>stem</b> <b>pitting.</b> However, the isolates {{from most of the}} accessions induced mild reaction on Mexican lime. The serological evaluation through the DAS-ELISA using monoclonal antibodies did not reveal any association between virus titer in the plant tissue and symptoms. The reaction with different monoclonal antibodies and the distinct electrophoresis patterns obtained through SSCP showed that there is a high degree of diversity among the isolates that infect these grapefruit accessions. High complexity within the same isolate was also observed in the SSCP profiles. This finding indicates that the CTV isolates from these plants are a complex mixture of CTV haplotypes. Similar SSCP banding patterns were observed among some plants with strong <b>stem</b> <b>pitting</b> symptoms, and among some plants with weak or moderate <b>stem</b> <b>pitting</b> symptoms. Isolados do vírus da tristeza dos citros (CTV) de 35 acessos de pomelos que fazem parte do Banco Ativo de Germoplasma de Citros, localizado no Centro APTA Citros Sylvio Moreira, Cordeirópolis, São Paulo, Brasil, pertencente ao Instituto Agronômico de Campinas (IAC), foram caracterizados através dos sintomas observados nas árvores, indexação biológica, diagnóstico imunológico e análise SSCP (polimorfismo de conformação de fita simples) do gene da proteína do capsídeo. O grupo de plantas que, em geral, apresentou menor volume de copa e severo sintoma de canelura diferenciou-se significativamente do grupo com maior desenvolvimento vegetativo e fraco a moderado sintoma de canelura. No entanto, a maioria dos isolados de CTV das plantas de ambos os grupos induziu fraca reação em limão galego e nenhuma relação entre títulos do vírus nos tecidos e sintomatologia foi observada na avaliação sorológica conduzida por DAS-ELISA. A reação com diferentes anticorpos monoclonais e os distintos padrões eletroforéticos obtidos por SSCP demonstraram que há uma grande diversidade entre os isolados de CTV que infectam os acessos de pomelos. Alta complexidade de bandas dentro de um mesmo isolado foi também observada nos perfis SSCP, demonstrando que cada isolado é constituído por uma mistura de diferentes haplótipos de CTV. Padrões SSCP semelhantes foram observados entre algumas plantas com fortes sintomas de caneluras e entre algumas plantas com sintomas fracos ou moderados de caneluras...|$|E
