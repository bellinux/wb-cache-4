50|$|For 1974, North American models {{received}} newly required 5 mph impact bumpers {{mounted on}} self-restoring energy absorbers, which added approximately 25 mm to the car's overall length.

A limited-edition Big Beetle was introduced based on the 1303 LS.

In the North American market, a limited-edition Sun Bug was introduced as a standard Beetle or Super Beetle. Both were finished in metallic gold and featured styled-steel 4.5 in-wide sport wheels. Inside were brown corduroy and leatherette seats, loop-pile carpet, and padded four-spoke deluxe <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> The Super Beetle Sun Bug included a sliding-steel sunroof.|$|R

50|$|The {{number of}} spokes in the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> has {{continuously}} changed. Most early cars had four-spoke <b>steering</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|A higher {{steering}} ratio {{means that the}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned more to get the wheels turning, {{but it will be}} easier to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> A lower <b>steering</b> ratio means that the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned less to get the wheels turning, but it will be harder to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher {{steering ratio}}, which will make the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> easier to turn. If a truck had a low steering ratio, it would be very hard to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> In normal and lighter cars, the wheels are easier to turn, so the steering ratio doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. The <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is therefore harder to turn.|$|R

The accessory, which is only for aesthetic/ergonomic enhancement, is meant for driving-style gameplay in which the Wii Remote would be held lengthwise in a two-handed gamepad orientation, steering the subject by tilting the controller. The Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel</b> is also sold separately. Since the Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel</b> was revealed, other similarly designed <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> accessories have been produced, including the Wii Racing Wheel by Intec.|$|R

50|$|The first button {{added to}} the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> was a switch to {{activate}} the car's electric horn. Traditionally located on the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> hub or center pad, the horn switch was sometimes placed on the spokes or activated via a decorative horn ring which obviated the necessity to move a hand away from the rim. Electrical connections are made via a slip ring. A further development, the Rim Blow <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> integrated the horn switch into the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rim.|$|R
