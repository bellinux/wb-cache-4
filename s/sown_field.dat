5000|$|Colour plays a very {{important}} symbolic role in traditional Slavic embroidery. Red is the colour of life, the sun, fertility and health. The majority of rushnyks are embroidered with red threads. The very word [...] "red" [...] means [...] "beautiful" [...] and [...] "splendid" [...] in Ruthenian: a red girl, a red sun or a red spring. The diamond-shaped design of the rushnyk is an ancient agricultural symbol, which means a <b>sown</b> <b>field,</b> or the sun, and expresses the idea of fertility and protection against evil. Ducks, in {{the centre of the}} rushnyk, symbolize the element of life-giving water. In wedding folklore a duck and a drake symbolize a bride and a groom, in other words a pair of ducks is a symbol of family life.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Changes on rice {{cultivation}} {{systems have been}} observed in the Mekong River Delta, Vietnam. These changes could have impacts on radar remote sensing methods previously developed for rice monitoring. Using Envisat ASAR data, {{this study showed that}} the radar backscattering behaviour is much {{different from that of the}} reported traditional rice, due to changes brought by modern cultural practices. At the early stage of the season, direct <b>sowing</b> on <b>fields</b> with rough and wet soil surface provide very high backscatter values for both HH and VV data. Around 10 – 20 days after <b>sowing,</b> <b>field</b> flooding dramatically decreases the backscatter. Afterwards, the backscatter increases and then reaches a saturation level at the middle of crop cycle. HH, VV and HH/VV are not strongly related to biomass, in contrast with the traditionally accepted knowledge. However, HH/VV ratio could be used to derive the rice/non-rice classification algorithm to produce a highly accurate map of planted rice areas...|$|R

There are several ways of being tied: A person who wants to impede this marriage, blows into a knot, knots it and puts it on the bride or uses other sorceries. However, it is also deemed a way of being tied if the bride nails, knots or locks a door with a key before the marriage. “While going to the house of the bridegroom, way is always changed and the unlooked-for ways are followed to be saved from tie sorceries that could have been buried in the way”2. n.

Variation of Bt gene expression in different cultivars over time and efficacy to bollworms are the main concern nowadays, studies undertaken on Earias spp proved the concerned. Similarly the efficacy of Bt cotton {{in the field is}} losing efficacy against the pink bollworm, survey conducted revealed high infestations in green bolls. Monitoring of lepidopterous pest population viz sex pheromone and light traps was carried out and forecast the increasing trend in all bollworms population. Studies on red and dusky cotton bugs continued and efforts are made to find bio agents for long term solutions. Seed treatment effect and development of natural on early and normal planting studies revealed that the population of jassid was more on early <b>sown</b> <b>field</b> than normal sowing also the natural fauna was recorded higher in the early sown. The distinct efforts of researchers of the section have proved meaningful in devising pest management strategies against common and new emerging insect pests through application of IPM. Studies are continued on host plant tolerance of CCRI, Multan and National Coordinated Bt. & non-Bt. Strains. The section also studied effect of different IPM strategies on insect pest for transgenic cotton. Screening of new insecticides was also conducted against major insect pests of cotton.|$|E

Thrasybulus led {{the man who had}} come from Periander outside the town, and entered into a <b>sown</b> <b>field.</b> As he walked through the wheat, {{continually}} asking why the messenger had come to him from Cypselus, he kept cutting off all the tallest ears of wheat which he could see, and throwing them away, until he had destroyed the best and richest part of the crop. Then, after passing through the place and speaking no word of counsel, he sent the herald away. When the herald returned to Cypselus, Periander desired to hear what counsel he brought, but the man said that Thrasybulus had given him none. The herald added that it was a strange man to whom he had been sent, a madman and a destroyer of his own possessions, telling Periander what he had seen Thrasybulus do. Periander, however, understood what had been done, and perceived that Thrasybulus had counselled him to slay those of his townsmen who were outstanding in influence or ability; with that he began to deal with his citizens in an evil manner. Herodotus, The Histories, Book 5, 92-f Aristotle uses Herodotus' story in his Politics, (1284a) with reversed roles, referring to Periander's advice to Thrasybulus via a herald. The herald reported that in response to his request Periander lopped off the tops of poppies, which Thrasybulus, upon hearing the account, knew to mean [...] "that it was necessary to make away with the eminent citizens".|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the timeliness of winter wheat sowing on results obtained in practical production. The research material comprises results of farm surveys conducted in years 1986 - 2003 and 2008 - 2013. Yields obtained by sowing earlier than the date adopted as the optimum did not cause reduction in yields and in many cases were higher than those obtained by sowing in the optimal dates. Delayed sowings were a risk factor reducing yields significantly. After taking into account differences in technology the average yields, on <b>fields</b> <b>sown</b> after optimum sowing date were significantly lower in both analyzed periods, respectively 4, 5 % and 2, 5 %. The relatively high yields were obtained from some very late <b>sown</b> <b>fields.</b> It proves that use of appropriate agricultural technology and good forecrops allows to limit the decrease in yield due to late time of sowing...|$|R

40|$|Grain {{yield and}} quality under {{terminal}} heat stress (post anthesis) {{are the most}} complex traits that are influenced by environmental factors and are characterized by low heritability and large genotype × environment interactions. The present study was undertaken to determine effectiveness of selection for genotypes tolerant to heat stress using differences in 1000 -grain weight (dTGW) under the optimum and late <b>sown</b> <b>field</b> condition. A Recombinant Inbred Line (RIL) mapping population derived from the heat sensitive genotype Raj 4014 and heat tolerant genotype WH 730 was evaluated for the heat stress over 2 years in a replicated trial under optimum and late <b>sown</b> <b>field</b> conditions. The parental lines were screened with approximately 300 SSR (μsatellite) markers out of which about 20 % showed polymorphism. These polymorphic markers were utilized for genotyping a subset that had clear contrasting variation for dTGW.

40|$|Water {{repellent}} {{soils are}} known to inhibit water infiltration, ultimately forcing water to flow via preferential paths through the vadose zone. To study water flow and transport in a water repellent sandy soil, a bromide tracer experiment was carried out, which started in the fall, after winter wheat had been <b>sown.</b> <b>Field</b> average soil water content and bromide profiles were determined seven times during a 474 d period. A one-dimensional convection-dispersion model was used to simulate observed flow and transport. It was found that water content and bromide profiles could be successfully simulated. The main reason was that despite water repellency no distinct preferential flow occurred within this particular experimental field. Only wavy wetting fronts were observed. This was due to a uniform vegetation cover and a relatively thick A-horizon (30 cm), which contrasts with known water repellent sandy soils with thin (10 cm) top layers in which typical fingered flow patterns had previously been found...|$|E

Most end their cycle within a year by natural succession (the indigenous associations) or by human influences (almost all adventive ones). Because all these associations are adventive, nitrophilous, anthropogenous weed communities, they can be called domestic associations. Four orders can be distinguished in the Netherlands.
