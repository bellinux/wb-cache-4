5000|$|... "McCormack {{was also}} {{questioned}} about the previous {{testimony of the}} supervisor of employment for the division of parole. This supervisor had testified that although {{he had never met}} “Big Bill” McCormack, he had met with McCormack’s brother Harry many times. The purpose of these meetings was that on numerous occasions men, who were being released from prison on parole, would have the prison officials put in writing a note that said, “Mr. H.F. McCormack will make immediate arrangements for this inmate’s union membership upon his release.” It was estimated that over 200 parolees were given “jobs” with McCormack’s Penn <b>Stevedoring</b> <b>Company.</b> Some of these jobs may have been legitimate dock work, but most ex-con’s employed by McCormack’s Penn <b>Stevedoring</b> <b>Company</b> were nothing more than thugs and leg breakers, and sometimes murderers for the union. When “Big Bill” McCormack was asked at the Waterfront Hearings why he had employed so many men with dubious backgrounds, McCormack said, “It’s because I take a human view of employee problems. I’m human, and they’re human.” Two of the “human” men employed by the McCormack Penn <b>Stevedoring</b> <b>Company,</b> after they were released from jail, were John “Cockeye” Dunn, and Andrew “Squint” Sheridan. Both men where eventually fried in the electric chair, after they were convicted of the murder of hiring stevedore Andy Hintz, while both killers were working for McCormack." [...] After McCormack's testimony, the New York Herald Tribune wrote, [...] "Mr. McCormack's activities on behalf of the longshoreman's union suggest that he has been pulling the strings for Joseph P.
