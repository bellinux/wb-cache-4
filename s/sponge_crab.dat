40|$|North Carolina fishery {{managers}} are considering methods to offer greater protection {{to the blue}} crab, Callinectes sapidus, spawning stock while maintaining a viable commercial fishery for female blue crabs in high salinity estuaries. We tested how effectively wire rectangles, or excluders, of two internal sizes, 45 x 80 mm and 45 x 90 mm, would prevent entry of ovigerous female (<b>sponge)</b> <b>crabs</b> into pots relative to control pots (without excluders) while maintaining sizes and catch rates of male and nonsponged female hard crabs. Field sampling among three pot designs (two excluder sizes and control pots) was conducted in Core Sound, N. C., during 2004 – 06. Median sizes (carapace widths) of mature female crabs were not different among the three pot types. However, median sizes of male <b>crabs</b> and <b>sponge</b> <b>crabs</b> were greater in control pots than pots with either size of excluder. Catch rates of mature female crabs from control pots were greater than from pots with 45 x 85 mm excluders. Catch rates of legal male and <b>sponge</b> <b>crabs</b> from control pots were greater than from pots with either size of excluder. Results indicate that using excluders involves a tradeoff between reducing catches and sizes of <b>sponge</b> <b>crabs</b> while also reducing sizes and catches of legally harvestable nonsponge crabs; moreover, the reduction in total catch and sizes would be greater for legal male crabs than for legal nonsponged female crabs. In high salinity waters close to North Carolina’s existing no-harvest blue crab sanctuaries, where females typically dominate catches of hard crabs, the benefit of using excluders to prevent entry of <b>sponge</b> <b>crabs</b> may outweigh a potentially modest decrease in landings of nonsponged females...|$|R

40|$|Surveys {{undertaken}} to characterise the marine benthic habitats along the Dampier Peninsula and further south at Gourdon Bay in the Kimberley region of Western Australia were augmented with epibenthic sled sampling of soft and hard bottom habitats. This paper describes the species collected, their biomass and relative abundance {{for the main}} groups of marine macrophytes and invertebrates. Five localities were surveyed; Gourdon Bay, Quondong Point to Coulomb Point, Carnot Bay to Beagle Bay, Perpendicular Head and Packer Island. Sampling was limited to fifteen epibenthic dredge operations {{from a range of}} habitat types and was designed to target the most common habitat types and to obtain species identifications of the most important species and those which typified different habitat types. Surveys covered a total of 1, 350 m 2 of seabed in depths between 11 and 23 m. We identified 415 taxa comprising: 1 seagrass, 43 algae, 52 sponges, 30 ascidians, 10 hydroids, 14 scleractinian corals, 52 other cnidarians, 69 crustaceans, 73 molluscs and 71 echinoderms. Despite the limited nature of the sampling, a significant number of new species, range extensions and new records for Western Australia and Australia were recorded. Within the algae, one range extension (Halimeda cf. cuneata f. digitata not previously recorded in Western Australia) and one possible new species of Areschougia were recorded. Two range extensions were present in the ascidians; the solitary ascidian Polycarpa cf. intonata has previously only been recorded in Queensland and Cnemidocarpa cf. radicosa only in temperate Australian waters. There were several range extensions for the crustacea, for example, the <b>sponge</b> <b>crab,</b> Tumidodromia dormia, has only been recorded in Queensland. One species of holothurian of the genus Phyllophorus could not be identified from the literature available and may represent a new species. Similarly, a small species of the echinoid Gymnechinus could possibly be a new species. The collections of hydroids, hard corals, crinoids and molluscs contained no new species or range extensions. There was difficulty in identification of some groups to species level due to the status of the current taxonomic literature (e. g. Cnidaria, Porifera and ascidians) and there may be a number of new species among the material collected. Among the anthozoa, {{there is at least one}} new species of Chromonephthea and potentially 10 range extensions to Western Australia. Sinularia cf. acuta and Chromonephthea curvata are both new records for Australia with both previously recorded in Indonesia only. Among the better known taxa (e. g. molluscs, echinoderms, corals), most of the taxa identified to species level have been recorded to occur throughout north-western Australia, however the diversity recorded in this study is less than other parts of the Kimberley and this is almost certainly a result of the small overall area sampled and the single method of collection utilised. The most important species on soft bottom habitats in terms of biomass was the heart urchin Breynia desorii (up to 326 g. m - 2). Sponges were the dominant fauna by biomass (up to 620 g. m - 2) on hard bottom habitats and biomass was dominated a by a few large cup and massive sponge species (e. g. Pione velans and two unidentified Spheciospongia). The biomass of other filter feeders, especially ascidians (e. g. Aplidium cf. crateriferum), soft corals (e. g. Chromonephthea spp.), gorgonians (e. g. Junceella fragilis and Dichotella gemmacea) was also high, indicating the importance of these groups in characterising hard bottom habitats. Although low in biomass, crinoids such as Comaster multifidus and Comatula pectinata were abundant in samples that included a high biomass of other filter feeders...|$|E

40|$|The {{blue crab}} (Callinectes sapidus) is a decapod {{crustacean}} that inhabits estuarine and marine ecosystems {{of the western}} Atlantic Ocean. Blue crab is {{the largest and most}} valuable fishery for Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina. In 2007 the blue crab fishery in the Chesapeake Bay crashed. Maryland and Virginia experienced the lowest landing levels since landings data were first recorded in 1950. As a result, I chose to investigate the east coast blue crab fishery and develop recommendations to improve blue crab populations of the Atlantic states. 	I analyzed blue crab landings data and management for all east coast states that report commercial landings to the National Marine Fisheries Service. In 2007 approximately 81. 5 million pounds of blue crabs were landed by New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and the east coast of Florida. The Atlantic coast landed almost 14 million pounds less blue crabs in 2007 than in 2006. Maryland saw the largest drop between 2006 and 2007 at almost seven million pounds, while Virginia and North Carolina both saw a drop of over three million pounds each. Most of the states analyzed showed a recurring pattern of a peak harvest in the mid- 1990 ’s followed by a profound crash to the low landings seen today. 	As a result of the crashing blue crab populations, I developed a suite of recommendations to improve populations coast wide as well as coordinate blue crab management. First, blue crabs should be managed in two regions, North and South, split at Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Second, female crabs need to be protected from havest pressures, especially <b>sponge</b> <b>crabs.</b> Third, dredging for crabs disproportionately targets fecund females so crab dredging should be banned coast wide. Finally, coastal ecosystems are severely degraded and tougher regulations and enforcement is required to preserve blue crab habitat...|$|R

40|$|Concern {{over the}} amount of {{by-catch}} from benthic trawl fisheries and research into the problem have increased in recent years. The present paper demonstrated that by-catch rates in the Queensland (Australia) saucer scallop (Amusium balloti) trawl fishery can be reduced by 77 % (by weight) using nets fitted with a turtle excluder device (TED) and a square-mesh codend, compared with a standard diamond-mesh codend with no TED. This large reduction was achieved with no {{significant effect on the}} legal size scallop catch rate and 39 % fewer undersize scallops were caught.

Extremely high reductions in catch rate (i. e. ≥ 85 %) were demonstrated for several by-catch species owing to the square-mesh codend.

40|$|Palaemon affinis is the commonest prawn in {{intertidal}} habitats of the North and South Islands, New Zealand. The population dynamics, community composition, {{and natural}} food preferences of P. affinis were {{studied in the}} Avon-Heathcote Estuary, and rock pools at Taylors Mistake and Kaikoura, South Island, in 2000. Bimonthly samples were taken at all three sites at low tide using a suction sampler for the hyperbenthic communities and a corer or quadrat for the benthic communities. The distribution of P. affinis was patchy and its abundance fluctuated seasonally, peaking at the estuary and Kaikoura in winter (~ 580 individuals per m 2) and at Taylors Mistake in autumn (294 individuals per m 2). The carapace length (CL, mm), total body length (TBL, mm), and wet weight (W, g) of P. affinis were measured. Males were 15 - 19 mm CL, 19 - 50 mm TBL, 0. 060 - 1. 091 g W, and females were 5 - 21 mm CL, 13 - 54 mm TBL and 0. 021 - 1. 691 g W. The size ranges differed between the populations. Males from Kaikoura grew at a slower rate than females (CL against TBL or W), but not those from the Culvert or Taylors Mistake. There were no differences in growth rate {{between males and females}} for pooled data. For the pooled samples, males were significantly smallerllarger than females in TBL, but not in CL or W. The sex ratios were skewed: males dominated the medium size class (9 - 14 mm CL at the Culvert and Taylors Mistake; 9 - 12 mm CL at Kaikoura), and females the large size class (15 - 21 mm CL at the Culvert and Taylors Mistake, 13 - 15 mm CL at Kaikoura). The breeding season of P. affinis was in spring and summer, but the time when ovigerous femaLes first appeared differed between populations. Size at onset of maturity for females in the pooled data was 13 mm CL, but the size differed between sites. Ovigerous female were 13 - 20 mm CL, 33 - 53 mm TLB, and 0. 370 - 1. 729 g W and carried 110 - 690 eggs that weighed 0. 033 - 0. 260 g W. There was no relationship between femaLe body size and fecundity (number eggs), perhaps because of low sample size. The communities at the three sites shared 8 species in common: 2 molluscs (Melagraphia aethiops and Notoacmea sp.), 2 polychaetes (Haploscoloplos cylindrifer and Nereidae), a crab (Halicarcinus varius), an amphipod (Gammaridae), an isopod (Sphaeromatidae), and a brittle star (Amphiura hinemoa). Gammarid amphipods and P. affinis itself contributed most to the similarity index for withinpopulation analysis and to the dissimilarity between populations. Environmental variables (minimum/maximum water depth, water temperature, substratum, site size, salinity) were not well correlated with community composition. At Taylors Mistake, salinity was important (~ 89 % similarity), but substratum type was responsible for most of the similarity (~ 51 % similarity) between communities. Contrary to expectation, P. affinis was mainly carnivorous. Gammarid amphipods were the main food item which was found in ~ 71 % of P. affinis stomachs. Other items included unidentifiable matter, polychaetes, molluscs, plant material, ostracods, isopods, sand grains, <b>sponge</b> spicules and <b>crab.</b> No difference in diet between sexes, size classes or seasons was found. Low fullness values were found with only ~ 28 % of 264 stomachs ~ 50 % full. Periodicity in the locomotor and feeding activities of P. affinis from Kaikoura were examined in laboratory experiments in tanks provided with a continuous supply of fresh flowing seawater. Prawns were recorded using a 24 h time-lapse video camera under constant (red) light. To test for the effect of tide on locomotion, two experiments were conducted with artificial tide cycles simulating natural tide cycles at Kaikoura under constant light (water temperature, 12 ± 1 °C), and under constant darkness (water temperature, 20 ± 2. 5 °C). The effects of day-night cycles on locomotion used a 12 h light: 12 h dark regime with a constant (low) tide (7 em water depth) at 14. 5 ± 2 °C. Feeding experiments were conducted using both a simulated 25 h tidal cycle and a 12 h light: 12 h dark regime (water temperature 19. 5 ± 1. 5 °C). Diel and circatidal rhythms in locomotor activity were found, with maximum activity at night and at high tide. No rhythmicity was found in the feeding activity of P. affinis...|$|R
