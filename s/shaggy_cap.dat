50|$|Differences {{from the}} parasol {{mushroom}} include its smaller dimensions, pungent (fruity) and reddening flesh when cut, lack of patterns on its stipe, and very <b>shaggy</b> <b>cap</b> surface.|$|E
50|$|Boletellus emodensis, {{commonly}} known as the <b>shaggy</b> <b>cap,</b> is a species of fungus in the family Boletaceae. It was described by English mycologist Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1851 as Boletus emodensis, and transferred to Boletellus by Rolf Singer in 1942. Characterised by a distinctive reddish <b>shaggy</b> <b>cap,</b> it grows in eucalypt woodlands. It produces a brown spore print, and has fusiform (spindle-shaped) spores that are 16-20 by 7-9 μm with longitudinal grooves. It is similar in appearance to Boletellus ananiceps, but the latter species is scaly rather than shaggy, has a pinkish tint, and lacks grooves in the spores.|$|E

50|$|The fungus has fruit {{bodies with}} irregularly shaped, <b>shaggy</b> <b>caps</b> {{measuring}} 3 - 15 cm in diameter, {{supported by a}} smooth, greyish stipe. Conditions of high humidity can result in reddish or pinkish drops appearing on the stipe. The spores of S. lanuginosus are roughly spherical, covered in small warts (tubercules), and measure 4.5-6 by 4.5-5 µm.|$|R
50|$|From above, {{it may be}} {{confused}} with the old man of the woods (Strobilomyces strobilaceus) as both have a similar <b>shaggy</b> <b>cap.</b> The bitter and inedible Sarcodon amarascens can be distinguished by its bluish-black stipe.|$|E
50|$|In the {{exhibition}} catalog for the 1962 show, this painting's entry at #21 states that N.S. Trivas {{went too far}} when he dismissed all of these paintings as being unattributable to the master, and that the <b>shaggy</b> <b>cap</b> is one which was often worn by farmers and Dutch sailors in the 17th-century.|$|E
5000|$|Tricholoma is a genus of fungus that {{contains}} {{a large number of}} fairly fleshy white-spored gilled mushrooms which are found worldwide generally growing in woodlands. These are ectomycorrhizal fungi, existing in a symbiotic relationship with various species of coniferous or broad-leaved trees. The generic name derives from the Greek trichos (τριχος) meaning hair and loma (λωμα) meaning fringe or border, although only a few species (such as T. vaccinum) have <b>shaggy</b> <b>caps</b> which fit this description.|$|R
50|$|The male costume {{consists}} of dark trousers, cloth, white shirt, dark jelek (a small dark-red sleeveless embroidered jacket) and black subara (characteristic high <b>shaggy</b> fur <b>cap).</b> Women wear weaved skirts (fute), colorful aprons, white embroidered dresses, dark jelek and white kerchiefs around their heads. They wear opanci.|$|R
50|$|Coprinus comatus (<b>shaggy</b> ink <b>cap)</b> {{decomposes}} into ink, {{and hence}} are prepared soon after picking and only young specimens are collected. While being a general mushroom hunting guideline, {{the avoidance of}} specimens growing in areas with high pollution is especially important with this family, {{as it is a}} very effective pollutant absorber.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>shaggy</b> ink <b>cap</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Danish naturalist Otto Friedrich Müller in 1780 as Agaricus comatus, before being given its current binomial name in 1797 by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. Its specific name derives from coma, or [...] "hair", hence comatus, [...] "hairy" [...] or [...] "shaggy". [...] Other common names include lawyer's wig, and shaggy mane.|$|R
50|$|The <b>shaggy</b> ink <b>cap</b> {{is easily}} {{recognizable}} from its almost cylindrical cap which initially covers {{most of its}} stem. The cap is mostly white with shaggy scales, which are more pale brown at the apex. The free gills change rapidly from white to pink, then to black. It is deliquescent. The stipe has a loose ring and measures 10 - 40 cm high by 1 - 2.5 cm diameter. Microscopically it lacks pleurocystidia. The spore print is black-brown and the spores measure 10-13 by 6.5-8 µm. The flesh is white and the taste mild.|$|R
500|$|The {{closely related}} species Battarrea diguettii is known in the United States from the Mojave desert, and differs from B.phalloides in that the spore sac emerges by ripping through {{the top of the}} exoperidium, rather than by circumscissile rupture. The endoperidium of B.diguettii is also smaller, and the spores emerge through a number of pores on the upper surface of the spore sac. Battarrea stevenii can grow taller, up to [...] Podaxis pistillaris, {{commonly}} known as the [...] "desert shaggy mane", occurs in dry locales similar to B.phalloides, but can be distinguished by its <b>shaggy,</b> elongated <b>cap.</b>|$|R
50|$|Coprinus comatus, the <b>shaggy</b> ink <b>cap,</b> lawyer's wig, or shaggy mane, is {{a common}} fungus often seen growing on lawns, along gravel roads and waste areas. The young fruit bodies first appear as white {{cylinders}} emerging from the ground, then the bell-shaped caps open out. The caps are white, and covered with scales—this is {{the origin of the}} common names of the fungus. The gills beneath the cap are white, then pink, then turn black and secrete a black liquid filled with spores (hence the “ink cap” name). This mushroom is unusual because it will turn black and dissolve itself {{in a matter of hours}} after being picked or depositing spores.|$|R
50|$|With {{the notable}} {{exception}} of the gigantic Phlebopus marginatus, possibly Australia's largest mushroom, {{many of the most}} conspicuous fungi have been introduced in association with exotic soil and trees; Lactarius deliciosus, Chalciporus piperatus, Suillus luteus and Suillus granulatus are European fungi found in pine plantations in Eastern Australia. The deadly Amanita phalloides is found under Oak in urban Canberra and Melbourne and has caused deaths. There are concerns at least one of them, Amanita muscaria is spreading into (and forming new mycorrhizal associations with) native Nothofagus woodland and possibly displacing local species. Lawns, farms and parklands see exotic fungi such as the <b>shaggy</b> ink <b>cap</b> (Coprinus comatus), the poisonous Chlorophyllum molybdites and several species of Agaricus, including the edible A. bisporus and A. campestris as well as mildly poisonous A. xanthodermus.|$|R
60|$|He was {{replaced}} by two willing helpers, and, half dazed and {{not knowing what to}} do, he slackly followed the others up the middle of the floor. All who were not needed stood watching them, for they made a striking group as they moved slowly forward, carrying {{what seemed to be a}} shapeless bundle of snowy furs. Devine was white from head to foot, a bulky figure in his <b>shaggy</b> coat and <b>cap,</b> though the bent forms of the other men partly concealed him; Harding came alone, walking unsteadily, with the snow falling off him in glistening powder, his face haggard, and his frost-split lips covered with congealed blood.|$|R
