In this paper we propose a list of indicators which synthesise the state of the farming system or the management effects on the environment related to fossil energy use, landscape and soil management. We selected indicators from the literature which can be applied at the field and farm scale, based on data obtainable from the farmer and / or from existing agricultural da-tabases; we excluded indicators based on direct measurements. In a second paper we will introduce indicators related to nutrients and pesticides use. The direct and indirect consumption of fossil energy can be calculated at different levels of detail and it is used to calculate the efficiencies of different systems (output/input ratios). Landscape indicators describe the presence and the density of various elements that compose the landscape (crops, linear elements, isolated shapes), allowing also, in one case, to com-pare landscape "demand " and "supply".

40|$|Abstract—Many {{digital signal}} processing, {{techniques}} {{have been used}} to automatically distinguish protein coding regions (exons) from non-coding regions (introns) in DNA sequences. In this work, we have characterized these sequences according to their nonlinear dynamical features such as moment invariants, correlation dimension, and largest Lyapunov exponent estimates. We have applied our model to a number of real sequences encoded into a time series using EIIP <b>sequence</b> <b>indicators.</b> In order to discriminate between coding and non coding DNA regions, the phase space trajectory was first reconstructed for coding and non-coding regions. Nonlinear dynamical features are extracted from those regions and used to investigate a difference between them. Our results indicate that the nonlinear dynamical characteristics have yielded significant differences between coding (CR) and non-coding regions (NCR) in DNA sequences. Finally, the classifier is tested on real genes where coding and non-coding regions are well known. Keywords—gene prediction, nonlinear dynamics, correlation dimension, Lyapunov exponent. ...|$|R

Potentially there are more ncRNA molecules yet to be found and their possible functions are to be revealed. The discovery of ncRNAs is a difficult task because they lack <b>sequence</b> <b>indicators</b> such as the start and stop codons displayed by protein-coding RNAs. Current methods utilize either sequence motifs or structural parameters to detect novel ncRNAs within genomes. Here, we present an ab initio ncRNA finder, named ncRNAscout, by utilizing both sequence motifs and structural parameters. Specifically, our method has three components: (i) a measure of the frequency of a sequence, (ii) a measure of the structural stability of a sequence contained in a t-score, and (iii) a measure of the frequency of certain patterns within a sequence that may indicate the presence of ncRNA. Experimental results show that, given a genome and a set of known ncRNAs, our method is able to accurately identify and locate a significant number of ncRNA sequences in the genome.

This work introduces new statistical tools for exploring auto-correlation structure in the <b>indicator</b> <b>sequences,</b> for the specific case of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences. It is known that the probability distribution of internucleotide distances of DNA sequences deviates significantly from the distribution obtained by assuming independent random placement (i. e. the geometric distribution) and that the deviations can be used either to discriminate between species or to build phylogenetic trees. To investigate the extent to which auto-correlation structure explains these deviations, the 0 – 1 <b>indicator</b> <b>sequence</b> of each nucleotide (A, C, G and T) is endowed with a binary auto-regressive (AR) model of optimum order. The corresponding binary AR geometric distribution is derived analytically and compared with the observed internucleotide distance distribution by appropriate goodness-of-fit testing. Results in 34 mitochondrial DNA sequences show that the hypothesis of equal observed/expected frequencies is seldom rejected when a binary AR model is considered instead of independence (76 / 136 versus 125 / 136 rejections at the 1 % level), in spite of chi-square testing tending to reject for large samples, regardless of how close observed/expected values are. Furthermore, binary AR structure also leads to a median discrepancy reduction of 90 % for G, 80 % for C, 60 % for T and 30 % for nucleotide A. Therefore, these models are useful to describe the dependences within a given nucleotide and encourage the development of a model-based framework to compact internucleotide distance information and to understand DNA differences among species further...|$|R

We obtain two {{formulae}} for {{the higher}} Frobenius-Schur indicators: one for a spherical fusion category {{in terms of the}} twist of its center and the other one for a modular tensor category in terms of its twist. The first one is a categorical generalization of an analogous result by Kashina, Sommerhäuser, and Zhu for Hopf algebras, and the second one extends Bantay’s 2 nd indicator formula for a conformal field theory to higher degree. These formulae imply the <b>sequence</b> of higher <b>indicators</b> of an object in these categories is periodic. We define the notion of Frobenius-Schur (FS-) exponent of a pivotal category to be the global period of all these <b>sequences</b> of higher <b>indicators,</b> and we prove that the FS-exponent of a spherical fusion category is equal to the order of the twist of its center. Consequently, the FS-exponent of a spherical fusion category is a multiple of its exponent by a factor not greater than 2. As applications of these results, we prove that the FS-exponent of a semisimple quasi-Hopf algebra H has the same set of prime divisors as of dim(H) and it divides dim(H) 4. In addition, if H is a group-theoretic quasi-Hopf algebra, the FS-exponent of H divides dim(H) 2, and this upper bound is shown to be tight. 1...|$|R
