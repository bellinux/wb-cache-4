To this end, an overview is made of the effects of an incident on the safety, by conducting a Delphi. It is concluded that for all risk groups, an incident brings additional safety risks especially in the first stages of an incident. The effects of the individual IM measures were quantified and combined with the results of the Delphi, leading to an overview of the effect of IM combined with the risks of a <b>secondary</b> <b>incident.</b> From this investigation it is concluded that IM has a positive effect on safety of all risk groups, especially in the later stages of incident handling.

40|$|The {{transient}} excitation of {{a straight}} thin wire segment parallel to a plane interface between two homogeneous dielectric half spaces is analyzed by the continuous-time, discretized-space approach. The analysis {{is carried out}} in three steps. First, the subproblem of a single wire embedded in a homogeneous dielectric medium, excited by a voltage source and an incident electric field, is studied {{with the aid of}} a time domain integral equation. This equation is discretized in space and transformed to the frequency domain. This procedure results in a system of linear equations of a fixed dimension which is solved by marching on in frequency. Second, the subproblem of a horizontal, pulsed dipole over the interface between two homogeneous dielectric half spaces is considered. The reflected field in the upper medium is computed by spectral techniques. With the aid of a time domain Weyl representation, a fixed, composite Gaussian quadrature rule is derived for the semi-infinite integral involved. The angular integral is evaluated in closed form. Third, for the complete problem, the reflected field in the upper medium is expressed as a superposition of contributions from dipole sources on the wire axis, and subsequently treated as a <b>secondary</b> <b>incident</b> field in the integral equation for the current on the wire. This integral equation is then solved by combining the techniques developed for the two subproblems. Representative numerical results are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Location of depots and routing of {{emergency}} response units {{are assumed to}} be interdependent in the incident management system. System costs will be excessive if delay regarding routing decisions is ignored when locating response units. This paper presents an integrated method to solve location and routing problem {{of emergency}} response units on freeways. The principle is to begin with a location phase for managing initial incidents and to progress through a routing phase for managing the stochastic occurrence of next incidents. Previous models used the frequency of independent incidents and ignored scenarios in which two incidents occurred within proximal regions and intervals. The proposed analytical model relaxes the structural assumptions of Poisson process (independent increments) and incorporates evolution of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>incident</b> probabilities over time. The proposed mathematical model overcomes several limiting assumptions of the previous models, such as no waiting-time and returning rule to original depot. Our stochastic programming method hedges well against a wide range of scenarios in which probabilities of a sequence of incidents are assigned. The initial non-linear stochastic model is linearized. As a long-term strategy, the model incorporates flexibility in choosing the locations. The temporal locations flexible to a future policy-change are compared with current practice that locates all units in one permanent depot. Comment: 26 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables.

40|$|The {{transient}} excitation of two identical, straight, {{thin wire}} antennas above a plane interface between two homogeneous dielectric half spaces is analyzed. The two wires are located parallel {{to each other}} and to the interface, and one of them is excited by a voltage source. By applying symmetry considerations, the problem is decomposed into two single-wire problems, for which a method of solution is available from previous work by the authors [Rubio Bretones and Tijhuis, 1995]. The problem is solved in two steps. First, the configuration of two wires in a homogeneous medium is studied. The electric field integral equation for the total current on the wires is derived directly in the time domain and subsequently solved by using the continuous-time discretized-space approach. This results in a linear system of equations of a fixed dimension which is solved by marching on in frequency. Subsequently, we consider the complete configuration. As in our previous work, the field reflected by the interface is treated as a <b>secondary</b> <b>incident</b> field in the integral equation for the currents on the two wires. This leads to an integral equation of a form similar to the one describing the currents on the two wires in free space. In this equation the response of a pulsed dipole source in the two-media configuration occurs as a Green's function. The spatial Fourier inversion involved is carried out with the aid of a fixed composite Gaussian quadature rule. This again leads to a system of equations of a fixed dimension, which can be solved by marching on in frequency. Finally, some representative numerical results are presented and discussed...|$|E

40|$|The use of two {{identical}} straight thin-wire antennas for {{the detection}} of a buried wire is analyzed with the aid of numerical calculations. The buried wire is located below an interface between two homogeneous half-spaces. The detection setup, which is formed by a transmitting and a receiving wire, is located above the interface. The transmitter is excited by a pulsed voltage in a small gap. A resistance profile according to Wu and King [1965] has been used to suppress the reflections {{at the end of the}} wires. This enhances the visibility of properties of the lower half-space directly from the time response of the current along the receiving antenna. The problem is solved in several steps. First, the electric field integral equation for the total current along a single thin-wire antenna in a homogeneous space is formulated. The result is then used to construct a set of coupled integral equations to describe the currents along all three wires without the resistive load. The integral equations contain the transmitted and reflected fields due to the interface. Next, the set of integral equations is adapted for the resistance profile along the wires of the detection setup. The reflected and transmitted fields in both half-spaces are treated as <b>secondary</b> <b>incident</b> fields in the integral equation for the currents along the wires. In these equations, the response from a pulsed dipole source in the same configuration occurs as a Green's function. The inverse spatial Fourier transformation that occurs in the transmitted and reflected fields is carried out with the aid of a frequency independent, composite Gaussian quadrature rule. The set of coupled integral equations is solved by using the continuous-time discretized-space approach, where the space discretization is kept fixed for all frequencies. This results in a linear system of equations with a fixed dimension which is solved by the conjugate gradient-fast Fourier transform (CG-FFT) method. With the aid of a marching-on-in-frequency scheme, the system is solved for a number of frequencies. Time domain results are obtained by applying an inverse Fourier transformation.

40|$|Resource {{allocation}} {{decisions are}} made to serve the current emergency without knowing which future emergency will be occurring. Different ordered combinations of emergencies result in different performance outcomes. Even though future decisions can be anticipated with scenarios, previous models follow an assumption that events over a time interval are independent. This dissertation follows an assumption that events are interdependent, because speed reduction and rubbernecking due to an initial incident provoke secondary incidents. The misconception that secondary incidents are not common has resulted in overlooking a look-ahead concept. This dissertation is a pioneer in relaxing the structural assumptions of independency during the assignment of emergency vehicles. When an emergency is detected and a request arrives, an appropriate emergency vehicle is immediately dispatched. We provide tools for quantifying impacts based on fundamentals of incident occurrences through identification, prediction, and interpretation of secondary incidents. A proposed online dispatching model minimizes the cost of moving the next emergency unit, while making the response as close to optimal as possible. Using the look-ahead concept, the online model flexibly re-computes the solution, basing future decisions on present requests. We introduce various online dispatching strategies with visualization of the algorithms, and provide insights on their differences in behavior and solution quality. The experimental evidence indicates that the algorithm works well in practice. After having served a designated request, the available and/or remaining vehicles are relocated to a new base for the next emergency. System costs will be excessive if delay regarding dispatching decisions is ignored when relocating response units. This dissertation presents an integrated method with a principle of beginning with a location phase to manage initial incidents and progressing through a dispatching phase to manage the stochastic occurrence of next incidents.

The functionality of automatic incident detection on expressways is a primary objective of advanced traffic management system.

This paper presents a methodology that integrates moving average (MA) model with stationary wavelet decomposition for automatic incident detection, in which parameters of layer coefficient are extracted from {{the difference between the}} upstream and downstream occupancy. Unlike other wavelet-based method presented before, firstly it smooths the raw data with MA model. Then it uses stationary wavelet to decompose, which can achieve accurate reconstruction of the signal, and does not shift the signal transfer coefficients. Thus, it can detect the incidents more accurately. The threshold to trigger incident alarm is also adjusted according to normal traffic condition with congestion.

For example, roadway incidents such as accidents, broken-down vehicles or other events that reduce the capacity of the facility impose a substantial cost to society when delays, congestion, <b>secondary</b> <b>incidents,</b> and environmental emissions are taken into consideration. These impacts can be substantially reduced through implementation of incident management programs. Significant benefits can be gained from early incident detection, quick response, provision of real-time traveller information and timely dispatch of emergence services. This can result in reducing traffic delays, secondary accidents, air pollution, and generally improve road safety and real-time traffic control. Recently, there has been a growing interest in developing traffic incident management plans for integrated freeway and arterial road networks and evaluating the effectiveness of such plans in minimising the effects of congestion. This is particularly important when evaluating incident management plans involving traffic being diverted to adjacent arterial networks. The impacts of incident management programs on network performance can be evaluated either in field studies or using traffic simulation. Field studies are generally expensive to conduct and they don't offer flexibility in investigating alternative scenarios.

40|$|Assessing and prioritising {{cost-effective}} {{strategies to}} mitigate the impacts of traffic incidents and accidents on non-recurrent congestion on major roads represents a significant challenge for road network managers. This research examines the influence of numerous factors associated with incidents of various types on their duration. It presents a comprehensive traffic incident data mining and analysis by developing an incident duration model based on twelve months of incident data obtained from the Australian freeway network. Parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) survival models of incident duration were developed, including log-logistic, lognormal, and Weibul - considering both fixed and random parameters, {{as well as a}} Weibull model with gamma heterogeneity. The Weibull AFT models with random parameters were appropriate for modelling incident duration arising from crashes and hazards. A Weibull model with gamma heterogeneity was most suitable for modelling incident duration of stationary vehicles. Significant variables affecting incident duration include characteristics of the incidents (severity, type, towing requirements, etc.), and location, time of day, and traffic characteristics of the incident. Moreover, the findings reveal no significant effects of infrastructure and weather on incident duration. A significant and unique contribution of this paper is that the durations of each type of incident are uniquely different and respond to different factors. The results of this study are useful for traffic incident management agencies to implement strategies to reduce incident duration, leading to reduced congestion, <b>secondary</b> <b>incidents,</b> and the associated human and economic losses...|$|R
40|$|In the United States, it is {{estimated}} that nearly 60 % of non-recurrent freeway congestion is caused by incidents. This non-recurrent congestion negatively impacts safety and mobility, and results in unnecessary use of fuel and the emission of dangerous pollutants. Incident management programs, such as Freeway Service Patrol (FSP) programs, are employed nationwide to mitigate the impact of incidents. FSP programs are subject to public scrutiny and potential cancellation. Thus, numerous states seek to prove that the benefits of their FSP programs outweigh their costs. In this paper, a simulation-based methodology is employed to estimate the benefits of such a FSP program, the Highway Emergency Local Patrol (H. E. L. P.) program, operating within New York State. The average reduction in incident duration due to the execution of the H. E. L.

Hundreds of incidents that arose along a roadway segment were replicated and benefits in terms of reduced travel delay, fuel consumption, emissions, and <b>secondary</b> <b>incidents</b> were estimated. The monetary equivalent of these savings was computed to obtain an estimate of the benefit-to-cost (B/C) ratio. A set of B/C ratios are provided for a range of average incident duration savings.

Methods: In the present observational longitudinal study baseline and 3 -year hand X-rays of 416 recent-onset RA patients were scored for osteophytes and erosions in IPJs, blinded for time, using Osteoarthritis Research Society International atlas and Sharp-van der Heijde score. The associations between inflammatory factors and <b>incident</b> and progressive <b>secondary</b> OA in distal IPJs (DIPJs) and proximal IPJs (PIPJs) and the effect of infliximab compared to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug treatment on secondary OA were analyzed by multivariable regression and generalised estimating equations analyses. Results: Sixty-seven percent of the patients were female with, at baseline, a mean age of 54 years and OA present in DIPJs and PIPJs in 37 % and 13 %. Three years later, new secondary OA in DIPJs and PIPJs was seen in 11 % and 10 %, and progressive secondary OA in 36 % and 35 %. High erythrocyte sedimentation rate over 3 years and progressive erosive damage were risk factors for <b>incident</b> <b>secondary</b> OA in DIPJs, but not in PIPJs. At joint level, progression of erosions was associated with both <b>incident</b> and progressive <b>secondary</b> OA, only in DIPJs. Infliximab treatment was associated with lower <b>incident</b> <b>secondary</b> OA in PIPJs [relative risk 0. 5 (95 % confidence interval 0. 2, 1. 0) ], independent of decrease in inflammation. Conclusion: <b>Incident</b> and progressive <b>secondary</b> OA in DIPJs over 3 years was associated with high inflammatory activity in RA. Infliximab treatment reduced <b>incident</b> <b>secondary</b> OA in PIPJs independent of decrease in inflammation, suggesting that anti-TNF-α therapy might be effective against secondary hand OA via other pathways than suppression of inflammation.

Operations data from the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) on DMS and ITS detection systems and incident management is analyzed to accomplish four key research objectives: a) To collect, extract and evaluate real time operations data from VDOT ITS and incident management operations programs and identify the factors contributing to the successful operation of DMS for the duration of incidents and events occurring on the I- 95 Study Corridor; b) To develop analytical models to determine measurable influence of incident detections in successfully disseminating messages on DMS; c) To develop ITS Operations evaluation models to determine the effectiveness of DMS messages during incidents by quantifying the influence of DMS messages in the deterrence of <b>secondary</b> <b>incidents</b> on the I- 95 Study Corridor; and d) To develop guidelines on the application of these quantitative ITS evaluation models so that transportation engineers can effectively use these models to perform ITS evaluations at other ITS locations. The ITS evaluation framework developed in this research work is expected to assist transportation engineers in the prioritization, selection and implementation of operations and technology integration strategies...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo {{investigate}} {{the association between}} systemic and local inflammation and incident and progressive radiographic secondary osteoarthritis (OA) in interphalangeal joints (IPJs) over 3 years in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients {{and the effect of}} tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitor infliximab on secondary OA in IPJs. MethodsIn the present observational longitudinal study baseline and 3 -year hand X-rays of 416 recent-onset RA patients were scored for osteophytes and erosions in IPJs, blinded for time, using Osteoarthritis Research Society International atlas and Sharp-van der Heijde score. The associations between inflammatory factors and <b>incident</b> and progressive <b>secondary</b> OA in distal IPJs (DIPJs) and proximal IPJs (PIPJs) and the effect of infliximab compared to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug treatment on secondary OA were analyzed by multivariable regression and generalised estimating equations analyses. ResultsSixty-seven percent of the patients were female with, at baseline, a mean age of 54 years and OA present in DIPJs and PIPJs in 37 % and 13 %. Three years later, new secondary OA in DIPJs and PIPJs was seen in 11 % and 10 %, and progressive secondary OA in 36 % and 35 %. High erythrocyte sedimentation rate over 3 years and progressive erosive damage were risk factors for <b>incident</b> <b>secondary</b> OA in DIPJs, but not in PIPJs. At joint level, progression of erosions was associated with both <b>incident</b> and progressive <b>secondary</b> OA, only in DIPJs. Infliximab treatment was associated with lower <b>incident</b> <b>secondary</b> OA in PIPJs [relative risk 0. 5 (95 % confidence interval 0. 2, 1. 0) ], independent of decrease in inflammation. ConclusionIncident and progressive secondary OA in DIPJs over 3 years was associated with high inflammatory activity in RA. Infliximab treatment reduced <b>incident</b> <b>secondary</b> OA in PIPJs independent of decrease in inflammation, suggesting that anti-TNF-α therapy might be effective against secondary hand OA via other pathways than suppression of inflammation. Further studies in populations of primary hand OA are necessary to determine the role of anti-TNF-α in treatment of primary hand OA...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} a {{deliverable}} of a project, TR 0002, {{sponsored by the}} California Office of Traffic Safety, contracted through California Department of Transportation, and conducted by California PATH. Roadway incidents, besides their direct impacts of property damage, injuries and fatalities, can quickly lead to further congestion or even <b>secondary</b> <b>incidents</b> of nearby traffic. Due to the direct and indirect effects of incidents and congestion afterwards, {{it is important that}} post-incident handling proceed as quickly as they can. One primary factor in the delays of incident handling is the necessary and proper documentation of incident information for legal and technical reasons. The prevailing method of scene measurement is often conducted by physically walking the scenes with wheel measures or similar tools. The common method and its conventional approach present several issues: time consumption, road hazard, limitations at site, and needs of photographic evidence. The objectives of this application are to resolve some, if not all, of the aforementioned issues encountered typically at accident scenes. In this project, we investigated and developed a computer software application using photogrammetric techniques to facilitate the measurement of the aforementioned incident scenes. This software will allow the user to simply take one or a few photographs and extract all needed measurements in the convenience of the office, solving the shortcomings of the conventional method. Jointly used with other field tools deployed by CHP or Caltrans, this application aims at alleviating the burdens of on-site measurements and expediting the process of evidence gathering. Ultimately, the goal is to reduce the impacts of incidents on roadways thus leading to reduced congestion, smooth traffic flows, and enhanced public safety. From this exploratory project, we have developed a software application that improves upon a current method of roadway incident documentation. This improved method is advantageous since it is a non-contact method, allowing the incident scene to be undisturbed and also allowing difficult or almost impossible-to-measure scenes to be measured effortlessly. Also, the photographs serve as a permanent record allowing future measurements to be made. Finally, the amount time this method saves during each incident is important to quickly restore roadway conditions and thus help resume traffic flow. ...|$|R
40|$|Traffic has a {{significant}} impact on national economy. In order to be effective, traffic flow has to run smoothly. One of the things that can cause disturbances in traffic flow and delays are traffic incidents. They cause non-recurrent congestions that cannot be predicted by time nor space. To minimize their impact an incident has to be detected as soon as possible. Whatever the method of detection is, it should be quick enough to reduce consequences like duration of congestion and possibility of <b>secondary</b> accidents. <b>Incident</b> detection systems are determined on two level: data collection technologies and data processing algorithms. Thesis presents various sensor technologies that are categorized into two major categories; roadway-based and probe-based sensors. They are broadly discussed and compared against each other. For a better understanding of measured traffic variables the basics of traffic flow are explained at the begining. A variety of algorithms for the purpose of incident detection are investigated in terms of their performance and ease of implementation which is later used for the case study. Theoretical detection time of implemented algorithm is compared against the one from given accident in terms of all vehicles delay. Finally, the delay is monetarized by valueof-time and the benefits are calculated for use of dedicated incident detection algorithms...|$|R
