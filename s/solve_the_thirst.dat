5000|$|Perfect, {{even very}} good, sealing is {{difficult}} to achieve. In a poppet valve engine, the piston possesses piston rings (at least three and sometimes as many as eight) which form a seal with the cylinder bore. During the [...] "breaking in" [...] period (known as [...] "running-in" [...] in the UK) any imperfections in one are scraped into the other, resulting in a good fit. This type of [...] "breaking in" [...] is not possible on a sleeve-valve engine, however, because the piston and sleeve move in different directions and in some systems even rotate in relation to one another. Mike Hewland claimed the run-in time for rings in his SSV designs was 10 hrs. Unlike a traditional design, the imperfections in the piston do not always line {{up with the same}} point on the sleeve. In the 1940s this was not a major concern because the poppet valve stems of the time typically leaked appreciably more than they do today, so that oil consumption was significant in either case. To one of the 1922-1928 Argyll single sleeve valve engines, the 12, a four-cylinder 91 cu. in. (1,491 cc) unit, was attributed an oil consumption of one gallon for 1,945 miles, and 1,000 miles per gallon of oil in the 15/30 four-cylinder 159 cu. in. (2,610 cc). Mike Hewland claimed in 1974 that the progress in lubricating oils, materials, and machining had <b>solved</b> <b>the</b> oil <b>thirst</b> problem, his experimental 500 cc single cylinder engines using less oil than their contemporary poppet valve 'competitors'. Some proposed an added ring in the base of the sleeve, between sleeve and cylinder wall. Single-sleeve-valve engines had a reputation of being much less smoky than the Daimler with engines of Knight double-sleeve engines counterparts.|$|R
