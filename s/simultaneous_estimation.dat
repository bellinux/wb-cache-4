In this paper, we propose a new unified approach to an investigation of point properties of <b>simultaneous</b> <b>estimations</b> of Poisson population parameters with general quadratic loss functions. The main accent is made on the shrinkage estimation. We build a series of estimators that could be represented as a convex combination of linear statistics such as maximum likelihood estimator (benchmark estimator), restricted estimator, composite estimator, preliminary test estimator, shrinkage estimator, positive rule shrinkage estimator (James–Stein type estimator). All these estimators are represented in a general integrated estimation approach, which allows us to unify our investigation and order them with respect to the risk.

40|$|Sequential (one-by-one) {{rather than}} <b>simultaneous</b> <b>estimation</b> of {{multiple}} breaks is investigated in this paper. The {{advantage of this}} method lies in its computational savings and its robustness to misspecification {{in the number of}} breaks. The number of least-squares regressions required to compute all of the break points is of order T, the sample size. Each estimated break point is shown to be consistent for one of the true ones despite underspecification of the number of breaks. More interestingly and somewhat surprisingly, the estimated break points are shown to be T -consistent, the same rate as the <b>simultaneous</b> <b>estimation.</b> Limiting distributions are also derived. Unlike <b>simultaneous</b> <b>estimation,</b> the limiting distributions are generally not symmetric and are influenced by regression parameters of all regimes.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) in soil moisture assimilation applications is investigated {{in the context of}} <b>simultaneous</b> state-parameter <b>estimation</b> in the presence of uncertainties from model parameters, initial soil moisture condition and atmospheric forcing. A physically-based land surface model is used for this purpose. Using a series of idealized twin experiments, model generated near-surface soil moisture observations are assimilated to estimate soil moisture state and three hydraulic parameters (the saturated hydraulic conductivity, the saturated soil moisture suction and a soil texture empirical parameter) in the model. The single imperfect parameter can be successfully estimated using the EnKF. Results show that all the three estimated parameters converge toward their respective true values, while the root mean squared errors (RMSE) of soil moisture associated with these parameters is on average reduced by 54 % and 53 % comparing with the non-parameter-estimation benchmark RMSE for near-surface layer and root zone layer, respectively. The {{performance of}} <b>simultaneous</b> multi-parameter <b>estimation</b> is significant degraded, mainly because the inherent balance relationship of these parameters is broken and the degree of freedom increases in assimilation processes. By introducing constraints between estimated parameters, the {{performance of the}} constraint-based <b>simultaneous</b> multi-parameter <b>estimations</b> are as good as that of single-parameter cases even assimilating temporal-sparse observations. In terms of the relative root mean squared error (RRE), the constraint-based estimation cases can achieve 36 % to 53 % in near-surface layer and 25 % to 50 % in root zone layer for different assimilation intervals ranging from 1 -day to 40 -days. This result suggests that the greatest advantage of this method can be displayed with a proper temporal-sparse assimilation interval of 10 -days as actual measurement interval of conventional in situ soil moisture observations. As these obtained constraints are mostly in statistical sense, this constraint-based <b>simultaneous</b> state-parameter <b>estimation</b> scheme is supposed to be suitable for other land surface models in soil moisture assimilation applications...|$|R
