5|$|The form of sEH in the {{intracellular}} {{environment is}} a homodimer with two distinct activities {{in two separate}} structural domains of each monomer: the C-terminal epoxide hydrolase activity (soluble epoxide hydrolase: EC 3.3.2.10) and the N-terminal phosphatase activity (lipid-phosphate phosphatase: EC 3.1.3.76). sEH converts epoxides, or three membered cyclic ethers, to their corresponding diols through {{the addition of a}} molecule of water. The resulting diols are more water-soluble than the parent epoxides, and <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> readily excreted by the organism.|$|E
25|$|Viscosity {{is a key}} melt {{property}} in understanding the behaviour of magmas. More silica-rich melts are typically more polymerized, with more linkage of silica tetrahedra, and <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> viscous. Dissolution of water drastically reduces melt viscosity. Higher-temperature melts are less viscous.|$|E
25|$|Another basic {{drive is}} the sexual drive which like food motivates us {{because it is}} {{essential}} to our survival. The desire for sex is wired deep into the brain of all human beings as glands secrete hormones that travel through the blood to the brain and stimulates the onset of sexual desire. The hormone involved in the initial onset of sexual desire is called Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The hormonal basis of both men and women's sex drives is testosterone. Men naturally have more testosterone than women do and <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely than woman to think about sex.|$|E

25|$|Whenever possible, social psychologists rely on {{controlled}} experimentation. Controlled experiments {{require the}} manipulation {{of one or more}} independent variables in order to examine the effect on a dependent variable. Experiments are useful in social psychology because they are high in internal validity, meaning that they are free from the influence of confounding or extraneous variables, and <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to accurately indicate a causal relationship. However, the small samples used in controlled experiments are typically low in external validity, or {{the degree to which the}} results can be generalized to the larger population. There is usually a trade-off between experimental control (internal validity) and being able to generalize to the population (external validity).|$|E

2500|$|As a {{practical}} matter, passwords must be both reasonable and functional {{for the end}} user as well as strong enough for the intended purpose. Passwords that are too difficult to remember may be forgotten and <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to be written on paper, which some consider a security risk. In contrast, others argue that forcing users to remember passwords without assistance can only accommodate weak passwords, and thus poses a greater security risk.

2500|$|Stigmata High-Five {{represents}} the latest musical {{style of the}} band. The grindcore and death metal elements are still present, but <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> progressive and experimental ideas mixed with metalcore elements. The album contains longer songs with more intricate riffs and atypical time signatures. For example, the opening song [...] "La Dernière Image" [...] moves from groove-oriented grindcore based around a repeating clave rhythm with odd meters interspersed throughout (the clave rhythm and odd meters are both basic musical features of much progressive rock). A middle section counters that with more ambient textures and clean guitars.|$|E
2500|$|Each race plays {{different}}ly, {{thanks to}} the different skills and characteristics of the players on offer. For instance, Dwarves, Orcs, Chaos and Undead teams all tend towards a blocking-heavy style of play, grinding down the opposing team as far as possible. Elves, by contrast, tend to have high Agility and plentiful movement, passing and dodging skills, <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> suited to avoiding contact while scoring through running and passing plays. Some teams pose challenges for experienced coaches because of inbuilt imbalances. For instance the Lizardmen team has a mixture of fast-moving Skinks and slow, heavy Sauruses, {{the challenge for the}} player being to make good use of these two complementary player types; the Halfling team is mainly composed of Halflings, who on the face of things are entirely incompetent thanks to being both weak, slow and unskilled, but can nonetheless be played effectively ...|$|E
2500|$|Since {{mannitol}} {{is found}} {{in a wide variety}} of natural products, including almost all plants, it can be directly extracted from natural products, rather than chemical or biological syntheses. In fact, in China, isolation from seaweed is the most common form of mannitol production. Mannitol concentrations of plant exudates can range from 20% in seaweeds to 90% in the plane tree. It is a constituent of saw palmetto (Serenoa). Traditionally, mannitol is extracted by the Soxhlet extraction, using ethanol, water, and methanol to steam and then hydrolysis of the crude material. The mannitol is then recrystallized from the extract, generally resulting in yields of about 18% of the original natural product. Another method of extraction is using supercritical and subcritical fluids. These fluids are at such a stage that no difference exists between the liquid and gas stages, <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> diffusive than normal fluids. This is considered to make them much more effective mass transfer agents than normal liquids. The super- or subcritical fluid is pumped through the natural product, and the mostly mannitol product is easily separated from the solvent and minute amount of byproduct. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of olive leaves has been shown to require less solvent per measure of leaf than a traditional extraction — [...] CO2 versus [...] ethanol per [...] olive leaf. Heated, pressurized, subcritical water is even cheaper, and is shown to have dramatically greater results than traditional extraction. It requires only [...] water per [...] of olive leaf, and gives a yield of 76.75% mannitol. Both super- and subcritical extractions are cheaper, faster, purer, and more environmentally friendly than the traditional extraction. However, the required high operating temperatures and pressures are causes for hesitancy in the industrial use of this technique.|$|E

They are not grieved at, nor yet do they forewarn their children to beware of such evil actions that are abomination to God, and to all good men. They let their children break the Sabbath, swear, lye, be wicked and vain. They commend not to their children an holy life, nor set a good example before their eyes. No, they do in all things contrary: Estranging of their children what they can, from the love of God and all good men, so soon as they are born. Therefore it is a very great Judgment of God upon children to be the Offspring of base and ungodly men. {84b} ...|$|E

So they traveled along till they reached a hill just on the outskirts of Sherwood. Here the lean man checked his lean horse into a walk, for the road was steep, and he wished to save his nag's strength, having far to go ere he reached Newark. Then he turned in his saddle and spake to Robin again, {{for the first time since}} they had left the cross.

60|$|Once more, {{in greater}} self-mobility a {{progressive}} differentiation is traceable. Dead matter is inert: {{some form of}} independent motion is our most general test of life. Passing over the indefinite border-land between the animal and vegetable kingdoms, we may roughly class plants as organisms which, while they exhibit the kind of motion implied in growth, are not only without locomotive power, but in nearly all cases are without the power of moving their parts in relation to one another; and thus are less differentiated from the inorganic world than animals. Though in those microscopic Protophyta and Protozoa inhabiting the water--the spores of algæ, the gemmules of sponges, and the infusoria generally--we see locomotion produced by ciliary action; yet this locomotion, while rapid relatively to their sizes, is absolutely slow. Of the Coelenterata, a great part are either permanently rooted or habitually stationary, and so have scarcely any self-mobility but that implied in the relative movements of parts; while the rest, of which the common jelly-fish serves as a sample, have mostly but little ability to move themselves through the water. Among the higher aquatic Invertebrata,--cuttle-fishes and lobsters, for instance,--there is a very considerable power of locomotion; and the aquatic Vertebrata are, considered as a class, much more active in their movements than the other inhabitants of the water. But {{it is only when}} we come to air-breathing creatures that we find the vital characteristic of self-mobility manifested in the highest degree. Flying insects, mammals, birds, travel with velocities far exceeding those attained by any of the lower classes of animals; and <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> strongly contrasted with their inert environments.|$|E
