40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} cancer <b>stage,</b> <b>distance</b> to treatment facilities and area disadvantage on breast and colorectal cancer spatial survival inequalities. We also estimate the number of premature deaths after adjusting for cancer stage to quantify the impact of spatial survival inequalities. Population-based descriptive study of residents aged < 90 years in Queensland, Australia diagnosed with primary invasive breast (25, 202 females) or colorectal (14, 690 males, 11, 700 females) cancers during 1996 - 2007. Bayesian hierarchical models explored relative survival inequalities across 478 regions. Cancer stage and disadvantage explained the spatial inequalities in breast cancer survival, however spatial inequalities in colorectal cancer survival persisted after adjustment. Of the 6, 019 colorectal cancer deaths within 5 years of diagnosis, 470 (8 %) were associated with spatial inequalities in non-diagnostic factors, i. e. factors beyond cancer stage at diagnosis. For breast cancers, of 2, 412 deaths, 170 (7 %) were related to spatial inequalities in non-diagnostic factors. Quantifying premature deaths can increase incentive for action to reduce these spatial inequalities. Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{intent of}} this study was to audit and {{evaluate}} the information content of pathology reports of resected gastric cancer specimens in Yazd, Iran. Methods: All gastric cancer reports of patients from the histopathology laboratories in Yazd over a six-year period who referred for adjuvant radiation therapy to Shahid Ramazanzadeh Radiation Oncology Center were evaluated for their informationcontent. A standard was adapted from the Nationwide guideline, version 1. 0 of Netherland that explained the minimum data set for gastric cancer pathology reports that included: histologic type, grade, T stage, N <b>stage,</b> <b>distance</b> between the tumor and nearest resection margin, tumor size and, location, as well as perineural, lymphatic and vascular invasion. Results:We audited 56 reports. Unfortunately, none of the reports were adequate. Tumor subtype was not reported in 80. 4 % of patients, grade in 16. 1 %, T stage in 8. 9 %, N stage in 26. 8 %, margin in 57. 1 %, tumor size in 10. 7 %, and location in 41. 1 %. Conclusion: This audit showed a need to improve the information content of gastric cancer pathology reports. The widespread implementation of template proforma reporting is proposed as the most effective way of achieving this goal. On the other hand, improving surgical techniques, adequate lymph node resection and tumor resection with adequate margins is necessary...|$|E
40|$|To date, {{no studies}} have {{investigated}} the estimated blood loss (EBL) after full robotic low anterior resection (R-LAR) in a case-matched model, comparing it with the conventional open approach (O-LAR). Forty-nine patients in the R-LAR and 105 in the O-LAR group were matched for age, gender, BMI (body mass index), ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) class, tumor–node–metastasis (TNM) classification and UICC (Union for International Cancer Control) <b>stage,</b> <b>distance</b> of the lower edge of the tumor from the anal verge, presence of comorbidities, and preoperative hemoglobin (Hb). EBL was significantly higher in the O-LAR group (P <  0. 001); twelve units of {{packed red blood cells}} were globally transfused in the O-LAR group, compared to one unit only in the R-LAR (P =  0. 051). A significantly higher postoperative Hb drop (3. 0 vs. 2. 4  g/dL, P =  0. 015) was registered in the O-LAR patients. The length of hospital stay was much lower for the R-LAR group (8. 4 vs. 12. 4  days, P <  0. 001). The number of harvested lymph nodes (17. 4 vs. 13. 5, P =  0. 006) and extent of distal margin (2. 9 vs. 1. 9  cm, P <  0. 001) were significantly higher in the R-LAR group. Open surgery was confirmed as the sole variable significantly associated (P <  0. 001) with blood loss (odds ratio =  4. 41, 95 % CI 2. 06 – 9. 43). It was a confirmed prognosticator of blood loss (P =  0. 006) when a preoperative clinical predictive model was built, using multivariate analysis (odds ratio =  3. 95, 95 % CI 1. 47 – 10. 6).
