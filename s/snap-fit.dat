2500|$|For joining complex {{injection}} molded thermoplastic parts, {{ultrasonic welding}} equipment {{can be easily}} customized to fit the exact specifications of the parts being welded. The parts are sandwiched between a fixed shaped nest (anvil) and a sonotrode (horn) connected to a transducer, and a ~20 kHz low-amplitude acoustic vibration is emitted. (Note: Common frequencies used in ultrasonic welding of thermoplastics are 15kHz, 20kHz, 30kHz, 35kHz, 40kHz and 70kHz). When welding plastics, the interface of the two parts is specially designed to concentrate the melting process. One of the materials usually has a spiked energy director which contacts the second plastic part. The ultrasonic energy melts the point contact between the parts, creating a joint. This process is a good automated alternative to glue, screws or <b>snap-fit</b> designs. [...] It is typically used with small parts (e.g. cell phones, consumer electronics, disposable medical tools, toys, etc.) {{but it can be}} used on parts as large as a small automotive instrument cluster. Ultrasonics {{can also be used to}} weld metals, but are typically limited to small welds of thin, malleable metals, e.g. aluminum, copper, nickel. [...] Ultrasonics would not be used in welding the chassis of an automobile or in welding pieces of a bicycle together, due to the power levels required.|$|E
50|$|The {{cantilever}} <b>snap-fit</b> is {{the most}} commonly used <b>snap-fit</b> of the three. A cantilever design can be multiple use or permanent. A multiple use <b>snap-fit</b> usually has a lever or pin to be pushed, in order to undo the <b>snap-fit.</b> However, on a permanent <b>snap-fit</b> there is no lever or pin. Attempting to undo a permanent <b>snap-fit</b> can result in the piece breaking.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the <b>Snap-fit</b> determines what {{it can be used}} for. There are three main types of snap-fits: annular, cantilever, and torsional. Most <b>snap-fit</b> joints have a common design of a {{protruding}} edge and a snap-in area. The specific name of the <b>snap-fit</b> is usually named after the type of stress or strain it utilizes; the torsional <b>snap-fit</b> uses torque to hold parts in place.|$|E
50|$|In a {{torsional}} snap fit, {{one must}} deflect, or force the protruding edges of piece B {{away from the}} insertion area. Piece A then slides in between the protruding edges until the desired distance is reached. The edges of piece B is then released and piece A is held in place. The <b>snap-fits</b> in this description are the protruding edges of piece B. These types of <b>snap-fits</b> may have a spring in place; so that when activated, the locked in piece is released and put into action.|$|R
50|$|With the {{development}} of new flexible yet springy materials, such as molded plastic, and new manufacturing processes, many new variations in these types of connectors have been invented, and are commonly called <b>snap-fits.</b> They can be found in on our phones, laptops, keys, and other household devices. Engineers have studied and developed these <b>snap-fits,</b> creating formulae concerning the amount of deflection allowed on the components, amount of torque one can take, and the amount of space one can allow in order to be detached.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a number of}} novel active fasteners developed to significantly lower disassembly costs during reconditioning, remanufacturing, and recycling of products. In the initial stage of the fastener development process, the applicability of distinct trigger signals for active disassembly (AD) is evaluated. Based on this evaluation, the high robustness of using a pressure increase or decrease as a nondestructive trigger for AD is demonstrated. Since previously proposed pressure-sensitive fasteners face considerable drawbacks upon implementation in electronic products due to the ongoing trend of miniaturization, a second generation of pressure-based active fasteners is developed. Evaluation of these fasteners by means of axiomatic design techniques and prototyping demonstrates that the presented <b>snap-fits,</b> which make use of a closed-cell elastomer foam, are most robust. Subsequently, the contraction forces that closed-celled foams can exert {{as a function of}} an increase in ambient air pressure are experimentally determined. Furthermore, the implementation of pressure-sensitive foam-based <b>snap-fits</b> in both a modem and a payment terminal is described. Results of these experiments demonstrate that the contraction force of a cross-linked metallocene polyethylene closed-cell foams can reach up to 6 N/cm 2 at an overpressure of 2 bar and that the foam-based <b>snap-fits</b> can be released at a pressure increase of 2 bar. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Some {{potential}} problems with {{being able to}} undo the <b>snap-fit</b> is hyper-extending it past its breaking point. As a solution, some parts have a stopper {{in order to stop}} the <b>snap-fit</b> from breaking. One very popular example is a battery compartment lid.|$|E
50|$|Plastics {{are easy}} to install; many have a <b>snap-fit</b> kind of {{jointing}} procedures.|$|E
50|$|Following {{a line of}} kits {{from the}} Round Vernian Vifam series, the 1985 Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam kit line {{incorporated}} the use of polycaps (soft plastic, typically Polyethylene) as connectors for better articulation of joints. The 1987 Gundam Sentinel model line introduced the concept of <b>snap-fit</b> models, reducing the need to use glue. And starting from the 1988 Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack line, all Gunpla kits feature <b>snap-fit</b> assembly.|$|E
50|$|Snap-together {{connectors}} {{have been}} used for thousands of years. The first ones were metal. Some of the oldest <b>snap-fits</b> found are snap fasteners, or buttons, shown on the Chinese Terracotta Army featuring soldiers from the late Warring States Period. Metal snap fasteners, spring clips, and other snap-type connectors are still in broad use today.|$|R
50|$|Multi-Jet {{printing}} {{refers to}} the process of depositing liquid photopolymers onto a build surface using inkjet technology. High resolution is attainable with a support material that can be easily removed in post processing. Unlike FDM, these parts are generally too brittle for <b>snap-fits.</b> However, lower durometer (softer) parts are possible with newer model MJP printers. This allows the user to create rubbery or hard plastic parts for more diverse applications.|$|R
40|$|Integral {{attachment}} {{features are}} a growing method of joining plastic parts. Guidelines and equations that can predict {{the performance of}} features are needed for more efficient design. A design of experiments approach {{has been used to}} generate approximate second-order equations (response surfaces) which can calculate the insertion and retention forces for the compressive hook integral attachment feature. The data for this investigation was generated using finite element methods. The response equations are based on geometric and material properties of the feature and have been compared to supplemental FEM and experimental results. The results show that in the range of the equation, we can predict FEM results within 10 % for feature retention. Guidelines for designing features have also been stated. These results can enhance the performance of the compressive hook feature through an improved design.

50|$|The annular <b>snap-fit</b> {{utilizes}} hoop-strain to hold into place. Hoop-strain is {{the expansion}} of the circumference of the more elastic piece as it is pushed onto the more rigid piece. In most cases the design is circular. Some popular examples are pen caps, ball and socket joints, Snap fasteners, and some water bottle caps. This kind of <b>snap-fit</b> can be used multiple times. However, permanent strain may develop, loosening the joint when it is used too often.|$|E
50|$|Building a <b>snap-fit</b> design {{requires}} more precise engineering than a screw or nail assembly, {{and is often}} more expensive. When snap-fits are being made, the producer needs to determine where the stresses of the parts will be applied to when assembled, or they break during assembly. The high production costs are due {{to the amount of}} calculation and precision that must be done {{in order to create a}} strong <b>snap-fit.</b> Another reason is the creation of molds; they are more time consuming from the integration of parts in the product.|$|E
50|$|Car {{models in}} the 1/87 H0 scale are {{presented}} at the International Toy Fair in Nuremberg. Herpa continues to extend this product line. Every following car model is put on the market using <b>snap-fit</b> construction (without any necessary gluing).|$|E
40|$|The use of {{integral}} attachment {{features in}} the form of <b>snap-fits</b> in assemblies comprised of plastic parts is proliferating. At the highest (i. e., attachment) level, the fundamental (or representative) shape of base and mating parts, imposed or selected installation direction and assembly motion, and possible and preferred attachment combinations must all be determined. Once this is done, decisions must be made on what specific types and forms of locking, locating, and enhancement attachment features are most appropriate for the application. This paper focuses on the issues that affect locking feature selection. Introduction Integral attachment features refer to all design elements on the interfaces of mating parts that guide, assist, and/or accomplish engagement during assembly without separate fasteners. Integral attachment features have been divided into three types based on their principal function, namely: (1) locking features, (2) locating features, and (3) compliant features [1 [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The global {{lab-on-chip}} and microfluidic {{markets for}} cell-based assays have been predicted to grow considerably, as novel microfluidic systems enable cell biologists {{to perform in}} vitro experiments at an unprecedented level of experimental control. Nevertheless, microfluidic assays must, in order to compete with conventional assays, be made available at easily affordable costs, and in addition be made simple to operate for users having no previous experience with microfluidics. We have to this end developed a multifunctional microfluidic capsule that can be mass-produced at low cost in thermoplastic material. The capsule enables straightforward operation of elastomer inserts of optional design, here exemplified with insert designs for molecular gradient formation in microfluidic cell culture systems. The integrated macro–micro interface of the capsule ensures reliable connection of the elastomer fluidic structures to an external perfusion system. A separate compartment in the capsule filled with superabsorbent material is used for internal waste absorption. The capsule assembly process is made easy by integrated <b>snap-fits,</b> and samples within the closed capsule can be analyzed using both inverted and upright microscopes. Taken together, the capsule concept presented here could help accelerate the use of microfluidic-based biological assays in the life science sector...|$|R
5000|$|The {{advantages}} {{of working with}} crop origin raw materials are readily observed if the social and environmental impacts are considered as well as monetary cost (the Triple bottom line), and the helix of sustainability helps to demonstrate this. For the full potential of biopolymers to be realised {{it is essential that}} attention is paid to every aspect of the manufacturing process from design (how to cope with the incertainties in properties associated with crop origin materials?), manufacture (can existing technologies be used?), through to end-of-life (can the redundant article be fed back into the materials cycle?). The entire supply chain must be considered because decisions taken at the design stage have significant effects right through the life of an article. Low cost assembly techniques (e.g. <b>snap-fits)</b> may make dismantling or repair uneconomical. However, if say, an easy-to-dismantle car is built, will there be any effect on the ability of the vehicle to absorb energy in a crash? At an even more fundamental level, what will be the social and environmental of the change in crop growing patterns. This low environmental impact approach to manufacturing is seen as an extension of waste reduction techniques such as lean manufacturing.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on characterising small waste {{electric}} and electronic equipment, specifically small household appliances, from two different points of views: disassembly properties and material identification. The sample for this characterisation was obtained from a selective collection campaign organised in Castellón de la Plana (Spain). A total amount of 833. 7 kg (749 units) of small waste electric and electronic equipment was collected, of which 23. 3 % by weight and 22. 4 % by units belonged to the subcategory household equipment. This subcategory, composed of appliances such as vacuum cleaners, toasters, sandwich makers, hand blenders, juicers, coffee makers, hairdryers, scales, irons and heaters, was first disassembled in order to analyse {{different aspects of the}} disassembly process for each equipment type: type of joints, ease of identification of materials, ease of access to joints for extracting components, ease of separation of components from the whole, uniformity of tools needed for the disassembly process and possibility of reassembly after disassembly. Results show that the most common joints used in these equipment types are <b>snap-fits</b> and screws, although some permanent joints have also been identified. Next, the material composition of each component of each appliance belonging to each equipment type was identified visually and with additional mechanical trials and testing. It can be observed that plastic and electric/electronic components are present in all the equipment types analysed and are also the material fractions that appear with higher percentages in the material composition: 41. 1 wt% and 39. 1 wt% for the plastic fraction and electric/electronic components, respectively. The most common plastics are: polypropylene (PP), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polycarbonate (PC), while the most common electric/electronic components are: cable, plug and printed circuit boards. Results also show that disassembly properties and material characterisation vary widely from one equipment type to another. The authors wish to thank all the schools and families who collaborated during the campaign for the selective collection of domestic small waste electrical and electronic equipment, and the company Reciplana Recuperacions S. L. for their assistance during the stages of transportation and final treatment of the sample after its characterisation.

The majority of post-1990 models have <b>snap-fit</b> parts, with models prior to that requiring an adhesive such as plastic cement. Plastic Gundam models kits are typically supplied with stickers and sometimes waterslide decals to apply extra colors and markings as seen in popular media such as TV shows, movies, manga or video games.

5000|$|Static model {{aircraft}} are commonly built using plastic, but wood, metal, card and paper {{can also be}} used. Models are sold painted and assembled, painted but not assembled (<b>snap-fit),</b> or unpainted and not assembled. The most popular types of aircraft to model are commercial airliners and military aircraft. Aircraft can be modeled in many [...] "scales". The scale notation {{is the size of}} the model compared to the real, full-size aircraft called the [...] "prototype". 1:8 scale will be used as an example; it is read as: [...] "1 inch (or whatever measurement) on the model is equal (: means equal) to 8 inches on the real (prototype) airplane". Sometimes the scale notation is not used; it is simply stated: [...] "my model is one eighth (1/8) scale", meaning [...] "my model is one eighth the size of the real airplane" [...] or [...] "my model is one eight as large as the real airplane". Popular scales are, in order of size, 1:144, 1:72 (the most numerous), 1:48, 1:32, 1:24, 1:16, 1:8 and 1:4. Some European models are available at more metric scales such as 1:50. The highest quality models are made from injection-molded plastic or cast resin. Models made from Vacuum formed plastic are generally for the more skilled builder. More inexpensive models are made from heavy paper or card stock. Ready-made die-cast metal models are also very popular.

50|$|In March 2014, Neato Robotics {{released}} an expanded model dubbed BotVac developed over several years, {{with a side}} brush previously available only on the limited distribution Vorwerk Kobold models in Germany (see below). BotVacs were initially priced about 20 {{percent higher than the}} older XV models. The new model featured additional major changes re-arranging the internal construction with larger filter area and dust bin, for less frequent servicing and covering larger premises, and the battery compacted into a single compartment instead of two separate compartments in the older models. The main front brush was made longer and closer to the wall, with a new more closely fitting bump sensor construction. Along with the side brush this cleans the margin against walls much more closely than the older models, which left a two inch wide strip untouched. The longer brush covers a wider swath of floor on each pass and the unit runs much quieter. The casing was modernized with more <b>snap-fit</b> fastenings and fewer screws. Internal electronics were upgraded and refined, and new commercial embedded systems operating system used. The brush drive belt was covered by a cowling with a new mounting method. A major improvement in efficiency was made with a lower voltage 10-cell 12v battery but higher in Ampere-Hours capacity than the older 12-cell battery, reflecting advances in battery manufacture over years. The battery remains NiMh compared to the Lithium battery used in Germany (and avoiding all hazard concerns with Lithium Ion batteries). However, the new Botvac Connected has a lithium battery. The BotVac is sold in several packages differing in accessories included such as extra filters and different brush types, same as the previous XV models were packaged.|$|E
5000|$|During the mid- to late-1980s, {{the quality}} of molding {{improved}} and High Grade (HG) level kits were introduced in 1990, starting from the titular mobile suits of the first four TV series.

Since 1999, the High Grade series uses various names to separate them from line to line. High Grade Universal Century (HGUC) refers to units that appear from Mobile Suit Gundam to Mobile Suit Victory Gundam and the series that are released in between. In 2010, this was expanded to include other series, under the lines High Grade After Colony (HGAC), High Grade After War (HGAW), High Grade Future Century (HGFC), High Grade Correct Century (HGCC) and High Grade Cosmic Era (HGCE). Models from Mobile Suit Gundam SEED/Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Mobile Suit Gundam AGE, Gundam Reconguista in G, and Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin were released separately under the sub-lines High Grade Gundam SEED (HG Gundam SEED), High Grade Gundam 00 (HG Gundam 00), High Grade Gundam AGE (HG Gundam AGE), High Grade Reconguista in G (HG Reconguista in G), and High Grade The Origin (HG The Origin), respectively.

40|$|In this thesis, a {{prototype}} automated disassembly system {{was developed for}} the disposal of end-of-life electronics. The system was designed to handle a family of electronic devices whose plastic, cantilever <b>snap-fit</b> covers house AA or AAA batteries. Examples of these devices {{included in the study}} were a TV remote control and a TI- 84 scientific calculator. The main focus of the prototype system was the design of an automated disassembly tool with the ability to remove the <b>snap-fit</b> cover and the batteries contained within. The design concept conceived to release the <b>snap-fit</b> and the batteries was a force sensing tool tip utilizing force sensing resistors (FSRs). The sensor feedback from the FSRs was used to control the movement of the tool during disassembly operations. A pneumatically actuated vacuum gripper and electromagnet system was developed for recovering the <b>snap-fit</b> cover and batteries once they were released by the disassembly tool. The disassembly module was mounted on the tool head of a three-axis translational motion robot. A Visual Basic GUI was developed to interface and control the robot with a Galil digital motion controller. The Visual Basic application was used to program an automated disassembly routine for the removal of the <b>snap-fit</b> cover and batteries. A model-based computer vision application was also developed in Visual C++ using a Kinect sensor and the OpenCV library to identify and localize the electronic device placed on the disassembly robot. The information gathered by the model-based computer vision application was used by the robot to load the necessary device parameters and compute the <b>snap-fit</b> and battery coordinates. The robot was then able to use the disassembly tool module to perform the necessary disassembly operations to remove the device 2 ̆ 7 s <b>snap-fit</b> cover and batteries.

However, due to geometrical complexity of the joints and the limitations of injection molding, they are used almost exclusively in large-scale manufactured products. Additive manufacturing offers the possibility to create end-user products in small and medium numbers with almost unlimited design complexity. This clears the way for new solutions using <b>snap-fit</b> joints to be explored. In this contribution, the existing design guidelines for <b>snap-fit</b> joints are challenged with the design potentials of additive manufacturing.
