30|$|In {{the single}} region {{emergency}} scenario, {{the results show}} that when the maximum emergency capability on line 2 is increased, two effects happen. First, the <b>scheduling</b> <b>quantity</b> in region B is increased. Furthermore, when the maximum emergency capability is decreased, the <b>scheduling</b> <b>quantity</b> also decreases. Specifically, the quantity of petroleum on line 2 significantly decreases from 5.0 to 3.0. Second, the minimum relief costs after reaching the network equilibrium will incrementally increase from 595.0 to 597.0. Therefore, the increase in the maximum emergency capacity will result in a larger emergency <b>scheduling</b> <b>quantity</b> for the entire network and smaller minimum costs for the rescue point for the corresponding crisis point. Otherwise, the results will be the opposite. For petroleum supply, we should increase the maximum emergency capacity to effectively promote a more flexible emergency response mode.|$|R
30|$|In {{the single}} region {{emergency}} scenario, {{with an increase}} in the emergency path’s vulnerability, the total emergency <b>scheduling</b> <b>quantity</b> has a slight increase to 5.1, the minimum emergency costs remain virtually unchanged, and the generalized emergency costs of the entire network greatly increase from 39.5 to 58.6. To relieve the shortage condition, the rescue points should be appropriately increased to allocate more emergency funds if the path vulnerability increases. In short, different vulnerabilities for the emergency path will result in an emergency <b>scheduling</b> <b>quantity</b> change, which further affects the minimum relief costs and the generalized emergency costs at each crisis. Increasing the robustness of the emergency path can effectively improve the emergency response efficiency.|$|R
30|$|In {{the single}} region {{emergency}} scenario, when α_ 1 = α_ 2 = 0. 5, the total <b>scheduling</b> <b>quantity</b> is 10.1, the minimum relief costs are 1189.9, and the generalized emergency costs are 39.48. When the weights change to α_ 1 = 0.2, α_ 2 = 0.8, the indicators are 10.1, 1189.9 and 45.0, respectively. When α_ 1 = 0.8, α_ 2 = 0.2, the indicators are 10.1, 1189.9 and 34.1, respectively. Compared with these results, we can observe that the weights of costs and time have minimal {{influence on the}} <b>scheduling</b> <b>quantity</b> and the minimum costs. However, it significantly affects the generalized emergency costs such as TC_ 2 < TC < TC_ 1, showing that the emergency costs will increase if more emphasis is put on the response time in the cross-regional emergency management of petroleum. The change of the weight has no significant influence on the <b>scheduling</b> <b>quantity</b> and the minimum costs, but it obviously affects the generalized emergency costs. Specifically, {{it is more likely}} that the generalized emergency costs would increase if the petroleum emergency scheduling process is completed in a shorter time, since more funds will be spent on coordinating the transportation of the cross-regional petroleum in order to shorten the emergency time.|$|R

30|$|In the cross-regional {{emergency}} scenario, with {{an increase}} in the emergency path’s vulnerability, the emergency <b>scheduling</b> <b>quantity</b> has a slight increase 0.004, but its total emergency <b>scheduling</b> <b>quantity</b> is less than the single region mode. Additionally, the minimum relief costs increase from 1190.38 to 1190.39, and this value is 0.5 larger than in the single region. Finally, its generalized emergency costs are all less than the single ones (39.5 [*]>[*] 35.9, 58.6 [*]>[*] 54.6), and the degree of generalized emergency costs’ decrease is more than 3.5. Therefore, with the increase in the emergency path’s vulnerability, the cross-regional emergency coordination mode is better than the single region emergency dispatching. When the cross-regional emergency dispatching network reaches equilibrium, the total scheduling of petroleum decreases. However, the generalized emergency costs are less than the single region scenario.|$|R
30|$|In the cross-regional {{emergency}} scenario, when α_ 1 = α_ 2 = 0.5, {{the total}} <b>scheduling</b> <b>quantity</b> is 9.9, the minimum relief costs are 1189.4, and the generalized emergency costs are 35.9, {{which are all}} less {{than those in the}} single region. Particularly, the reduction in generalized emergency costs is more than with the other two measures. Furthermore, we find that when α_ 1 = 0.8, α_ 2 = 0.2, its generalized emergency costs decrease by 5.2, which is the largest decrease. However, its total <b>scheduling</b> <b>quantity</b> and minimum relief costs have the smallest decreases. No matter how the emergency costs and time weights change, the total scheduling of petroleum resources in the cross-regional emergency dispatching mode are all less than that in the single-regional one. Furthermore, the minimum relief costs and the generalized emergency costs of the cross-regional emergency dispatching are also significantly less than the single-regional mode. Therefore, the cross-regional emergency coordination mode shows a better emergency effect compared with single region emergency dispatching.|$|R
30|$|In {{the single}} region {{emergency}} scenario, {{the results show}} that the increase in minimum relief costs in the crisis point 1 will decrease the emergency <b>scheduling</b> <b>quantity</b> of petroleum in region A from 10.1 to 9.9, increase the minimum relief costs and decrease the generalized emergency costs of the entire network from 39.5 to 36.9. The above analysis indicates that if the vulnerabilities of crisis points change, the allocated petroleum on the path will be significantly increased, while the minimum relief costs and the general emergency costs will also surge. However, we are setting v_w 1 = v_w 2 = 1, which indicates that the crisis point has a strong robustness. Afterwards, the minimum relief costs and the petroleum quantity at crisis points 1 and 2 sharply decrease to 597.0 and 5.0, respectively, and the generalized emergency costs decline to 23.0. This finding shows that if the region’s response capacity for relieving petroleum shortages is strong, the generalized emergency costs will barely be affected by the petroleum shortages. Ultimately, for regional petroleum emergency scheduling, with the increasing vulnerability of petroleum demand, there will be larger demand and a greater minimum cost for the petroleum emergency. Otherwise, they will barely be affected by the shortage of petroleum. In the cross-regional emergency scenario, with the increase in the minimum relief costs at the crisis point 1, the emergency <b>scheduling</b> <b>quantity</b> of petroleum in region A increases. Furthermore, when the vulnerability of crisis points 1 and 2 reach a maximum, the emergency <b>scheduling</b> <b>quantity</b> of petroleum increases instead. The change of minimum emergency costs is consistent with the changing direction of the minimum relief costs. When the vulnerability of crisis points 1 and 2 increase or decrease, the generalized emergency costs both decrease. However, while the vulnerability of crisis points 1 and 2 reach a minimum, the generalized emergency costs in the cross-regional mode is much higher than the single one (33.5 [*]≫[*] 23.0). In short, the more vulnerable the crisis point is, the more we need the cross-regional emergency dispatching coordination model. If the crisis point has a higher robustness, the single region emergency mode is obviously more efficient.|$|R

30|$|In the cross-regional {{emergency}} scenario, {{with the}} decrease in links between rescue point B and transfer point 2, the emergency <b>scheduling</b> <b>quantity</b> of petroleum in this region decreases, and this quantity is less than that in the single mode. The minimum relief costs and generalized emergency costs both increase under identical conditions. However, the generalized emergency costs sharply decline when the link between rescue point B and transfer point 2 increases, which {{is less than the}} single one. Compared with the single region emergency dispatching mode, the cross-regional mode has lower costs and more capacity. Although the minimum relief costs increased slightly the cross-regional emergency coordination mode is better than the single region emergency dispatching.|$|R

However, enterprises may not adopt the resulting solutions because some widths of the inventory exceed or are less than those required for acceptable scheduling. To ensure that the results better suit the actual requirements, we present a new decision model based on the adjustment of scheduling and limitation of inventory quantity to differentiate trim loss and inventory distribution data.

30|$|In the cross-regional {{emergency}} scenario, {{we witness}} three effects. First, when the maximum emergency capability on line 2 is changed, {{the change in}} the <b>scheduling</b> <b>quantity</b> in the cross-regional mode coincides with it in the single one. However, the variational change of cross-regional emergency dispatching is smaller. Second, when the maximum emergency capability is increased, the minimum emergency costs decrease, and these costs are greater than those in the single one. However, when the maximum emergency capability is decreased, the minimum emergency costs increase and the costs are less than the single mode. Third, the generalized emergency costs are less than the single mode. When the maximum emergency capability is decreased, the generalized emergency costs sharply decline. Furthermore, the increase in the maximum emergency capability leads to an argument with the petroleum emergency quantity. Then, the total network coordination quantity increases and the generalized emergency costs sharply decline. All of these show that the cross-regional emergency coordination mode is better than single region emergency dispatching.|$|R
30|$|In {{the single}} region {{emergency}} scenario, {{the results show}} that as the links between rescue point B and transfer point 2 decrease, the emergency <b>scheduling</b> <b>quantity</b> of petroleum in this region decreases. However, the minimum relief costs and the general emergency costs both increase. In addition, by setting r_ 2 = 10, the petroleum on that line increases to 5.0, while the minimum relief costs and the general emergency costs are reduced to 595.0 and 37.0, respectively. That finding means that the increase in links tends to result in more allocated petroleum and lower costs. Therefore, with an increase in cross-regional links, there should be more petroleum for an emergency, lower generalized emergency costs, and better emergency effects. Otherwise, the emergency effects will be weakened. There are two ways to reduce the emergency costs. One is increasing the coordination of the cross-regional emergency, and the other is technical innovations in the petroleum emergency.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn Manufacturing Planning and Control Systems, the Master Production Schedule (MPS) makes a {{link between}} {{tactical}} and operational levels, taking into account information provided by end items, demand forecast as well as Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) suggestions. Therefore, MPS {{plays an important role}} to maintain an adequate customers service level and an efficient production system. In a rolling planning horizon, MPS is periodically computed over whole operational horizon. The differences between <b>scheduled</b> <b>quantities</b> obtained by this process are related to MPS instability. This feature of MPS has negative effects, both, at tactical level and also at operational one. In this paper, a Mixed Integer Programming model is proposed for MPS instability. The proposed model considers instability minimization in addition to inventory costs and set up. Simulation is used to take into account stochastic demand. Computation experiments are presented in order to show the efficiency of this approach by finding stable MPS without a considerably increase in the total cost...|$|R
40|$|We {{study how}} {{differences}} {{in the nature of}} product demand affect the strategic value of investment production and supply chain flexibility. We consider how production flexibility, as illustrated by the ability to alter production <b>schedules</b> or <b>quantities,</b> and supplier flexibility, as indirectly modeled through a supplier’s lead time, interact with demand updating capability, usually enabled through appropriate information technology investments, to determine the performance of supply chains. We propose a single period inventory modeling framework with two ordering opportunities. The second order reflects updated demand information and potentially capitalizes on production flexibility. In this framework we analyze the total inventory cost of a firm. We model functional products through the standard assumption of independent demand over the period, fashion-driven innovative products through a Bayesian model and innovative products with evolving demand through a martingale process. We show that production quantity flexibility enabled through information updating capability and sufficient capacity is of primary importance to fashion-driven goods while full production flexibility (both in <b>scheduling</b> and <b>quantity...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background. Formal {{demography}} has a {{long history}} of building simple models of age <b>schedules</b> of demographic <b>quantities,</b> e. g. mortality and fertility rates.

The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) factorizes a matrix into three matrices with useful properties including the ability to reconstruct the original matrix using many fewer, simple matrices. This work demonstrates how these properties can be exploited to build parsimonious models of whole age <b>schedules</b> of demographic <b>quantities</b> that can be further parameterized in terms of arbitrary covariates. Methods. The SVD is presented and explained in detail with attention to developing an intuitive understanding. The SVD is used to construct a general, component model of demographic age schedules, and that model is demonstrated with age-specific mortality and fertility rates. Finally, the model is used (1) to predict age-specific mortality using HIV indicators and summary measures of age-specific mortality, and (2) to predict age-specific fertility using the total fertility rate (TFR) ...|$|R
