He briefly introduced the extraterrestrial hypothesis in The Robot's Rebellion (1994), citing Bill Cooper's Behold a Pale Horse (1991), and expanded it in And the Truth Shall <b>Set</b> <b>You</b> Free (1995), citing Barbara Marciniak's Bringers of the Dawn (1992).|$|E

25|$|While Hubbard {{put into}} {{question}} where the Bible originated from, Scientology claims that “it does not conflict with other religions or religious practices, as it clarifies them and brings understanding of the spiritual nature of Man.” Martin and Zacharias write in The Kingdom of the Cults (2003), differentiating the truth in Scientology and in Jesus’ teachings. While Jesus gave “an objective standard of truth: himself,” Hubbard said “Know thyself and the truth shall <b>set</b> <b>you</b> free,” expressing the subjectivity and existentiality of truth in Scientology, compared to the centrality of Jesus {{in the pursuit of}} truth in Christianity.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the next}} seven years—in The Robots' Rebellion (1994), And the Truth Shall <b>Set</b> <b>You</b> Free (1995), The Biggest Secret (1999), and Children of the Matrix (2001)—he {{developed}} his worldview of New Age conspiracism. His endorsement of the anti-Semitic forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion in The Robots' Rebellion, combined with Holocaust denial in And the Truth Shall <b>Set</b> <b>You</b> Free, led his publisher to refuse to publish his books, which were self-published thereafter. At {{the heart of his}} theories lies the idea that many prominent figures belong to the Babylonian Brotherhood, a group of shapeshifting reptilian humanoids who are propelling humanity toward a global fascist state, or New World Order. The reptilians use the rings of Saturn and the Moon, all reptilian constructs, to broadcast our [...] "five-sense prison": an [...] "artificial sense of self and the world" [...] that humans perceive as reality.|$|E

500|$|Icke's next manuscript, And the Truth Shall <b>Set</b> <b>You</b> Free (1995), {{contained}} a chapter questioning {{aspects of the}} Holocaust, which caused a rift with his publisher, Gateway. In addition to Holocaust denial, Icke claims {{in the book that}} Jews [...] "dominated the Versailles Peace Conference and created the circumstances which made the Second World War inevitable. They financed Hitler to power in 1933 and made the funds available for his rearmament." [...] After borrowing £15,000 from a friend, Icke set up Bridge of Love Publications, later called David Icke Books, and self-published that book and all his work thereafter. He wrote in 2004 that And the Truth was one of his proudest achievements.|$|E
500|$|Lynch and {{his family}} spent five years living in an {{atmosphere}} of [...] "violence, hate and filth". The area was rife with crime, which would later inform the tone of his work. Describing this period of his life, Lynch said [...] "I saw so many things in Philadelphia I couldn't believe... I saw a grown woman grab her breasts and speak like a baby, complaining her nipples hurt. This kind of thing will <b>set</b> <b>you</b> back".

The part [...] "If I was a ruler I'd try to <b>set</b> <b>you</b> straight, but your love is like a sharpener, it really grates" [...] was praised by several critics, while the lines [...] "A rubber band was an analogy, you can even say it's a metaphor" [...] were {{described}} by others as unnecessary, with Becky Bain for Idolator calling it [...] "dumber-than-dumb".

500|$|The Edict of Tolerance in 1787 gave Protestants {{legal status}} and a {{congregation}} was formed under the pastorship of Paul-Henri Marron, {{who had been}} serving as the chaplain at the Dutch embassy. [...] The congregation gained permission to worship openly in 1789 during the revolution and met {{in a variety of}} places including a wine shop before gaining permission to rent Saint-Louis-du-Louve, the first building dedicated to Protestant worship in the history of Paris. [...] For the dedication of the new church, or temple as French Protestants referred to their buildings, Pastor Marron preached from the text, [...] "Soyez joyeux dans l’espérance, patients dans l’affliction, persévérants dans la prière," [...] (be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer (Romans 12:12)). [...] When the mayor, Jean Bailly, attended in person on 13 October 1791 Marron chose the passage, [...] "Vous connaissez la vérité et la vérité vous rendra libres," [...] (you will know the truth, and the truth will <b>set</b> <b>you</b> free (John 8:32)).|$|E
500|$|The {{script is}} also {{thought to have}} been {{inspired}} by Lynch's fear of fatherhood; his daughter Jennifer had been born with [...] "severely clubbed feet", requiring extensive corrective surgery as a child. Jennifer has said that her own unexpected conception and birth defects were the basis for the film's themes. The film's tone was also shaped by Lynch's time living in a troubled neighborhood in Philadelphia. Lynch and his family spent five years living in an atmosphere of [...] "violence, hate and filth". The area was rife with crime, inspiring the bleak urban backdrop of Eraserhead. Describing this period of his life, Lynch said, [...] "I saw so many things in Philadelphia I couldn't believe... I saw a grown woman grab her breasts and speak like a baby, complaining her nipples hurt. This kind of thing will <b>set</b> <b>you</b> back". Film critic Greg Olson, in his book David Lynch: Beautiful Dark, posits that this time contrasted starkly with the director's childhood in the Pacific Northwest, giving the director a [...] "bipolar, Heaven-and-Hell vision of America" [...] which has subsequently shaped his films.|$|E

500|$|Lead actress Anna Torv later cited two {{scenes in}} [...] "Marionette" [...] {{of which she}} was most proud of during her time on Fringe. The first was Olivia's {{discovery}} that Peter was sleeping with Fauxlivia and her reaction— going through all of her clothes in disgust; the second related to her comment to Peter that she couldn't [...] "believe that you didn't know it was me." [...] Torv explained, [...] "The reason I love those scenes is because it’s really easy to be great in your own bedroom , {{but when you get}} on <b>set</b> <b>you</b> have so many different obstacles. The scene with Peter and me outside was done at like 1:30 in the morning, in the middle of town, so we had piles of drunk people screaming up and down the street, and massive fire engines and trucks coming through…. We're doing this quiet scene where I have to cry and we're on the clock, but that’s what TV teaches you -– to just go with it very quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|Silent Hill {{has been}} {{compared}} to the Resident Evil series of survival horror video games. Bobba Fatt of GamePro labeled Silent Hill a [...] "shameless but slick Resident Evil clone", while Edge described it as [...] "a near-perfect sim nightmare." [...] Others felt that Silent Hill was Konami's answer to the Resident Evil series in that, while they noted a similarity, Silent Hill utilized a different form of horror to induce fear, attempting to form a disturbing atmosphere for the player, in contrast to the visceral scares and action-oriented approach of Resident Evil. Adding to the atmosphere was the audio, which was well-received; Billy Matjiunis of TVG described the ambient music as [...] "engrossing"; a reviewer for Game Revolution also praised the audio, commenting that the sound and music [...] "will <b>set</b> <b>you</b> on edge". Less well-received was the voice acting which, although some reviewers remarked it was better than that found in the Resident Evil series, was found poor overall by reviewers, and accompanied by pauses between lines that served to spoil the atmosphere.|$|E
500|$|An {{unusually large}} amount of in-camera effects {{were used for the}} pilot in place of {{computer}} generated imagery, including [...] "upside-down day"; shots of Haller using his abilities, where multiple takes of debris were filmed in controlled camera movements and then overlayed on shots of Stevens acting on his own; a montage that appears as a single camera movement, pulling [...] "back in slow motion as we see David Haller’s childhood progress"; and a one-shot action sequence—actually filmed in two shots that were later connected with visual effects—that saw the camera mounted on a cable and run down a hill side. Hawley admitted {{that it would be a}} challenge for the series' other directors to maintain this quality of visuals with much less time to film each episode: Hawley had 21 days to film the pilot, but the subsequent episodes were only scheduled 8 days of filming each. Some of these shoots ultimately had to be extended to 10 or 11 days filming to meet Hawley's vision, which he said were [...] "not good calls to have but what are you going to do? It’s a huge show." [...] Keller felt that each episode in the season was noticeably different from the others, calling the series a uniquely [...] "director-driven show. It's almost like the episode prior doesn't <b>set</b> <b>you</b> up for how the next episode is going to go." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{few months}} after the {{publication}} of Newton's article, Lerone Bennett responded with an essay on the film in Ebony, titled [...] "The Emancipation Orgasm: Sweetback in Wonderland," [...] in which he discussed the film's [...] "black aesthetic". Bennett argued that the film romanticized the poverty and misery of the ghetto and that [...] "some men foolishly identify the black aesthetic with empty bellies and big bottomed prostitutes." [...] Bennett concluded that the film is [...] "neither revolutionary nor black because it presents the spectator with sterile daydreams and a superhero who is ahistorical, selfishly individualist with no revolutionary program, who acts out of panic and desperation." [...] Bennett described Sweetback's sexual initiation at ten years old as the [...] "rape of a child by a 40-year-old prostitute." [...] Bennett described instances when Sweetback saved himself through the use of his sexual prowess as [...] "emancipation orgasms" [...] and stated that [...] "it is necessary to say frankly that nobody ever fucked his way to freedom. And it is mischievous and reactionary finally for anyone to suggest to black people in 1971 {{that they are going to}} be able to screw their way across the Red Sea. Fucking will not <b>set</b> <b>you</b> free. If fucking freed, black people would have celebrated the millennium 400 years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Madonna has been {{involved}} in writing and producing most of her own music. Stuart Price, who worked on Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), said that [...] "You don't produce Madonna, you collaborate with her. She's a really good producer herself and obviously a great writer too. She has her vision and knows how to get it." [...] Madonna's early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the Breakfast Club in 1979. According to author Carol Gnojewski, her first attempts at songwriting are perceived as an important self-revelation, as Madonna said: [...] "I don't know where [...] came from. It was like magic. I'd write a song every day. I said 'Wow, I was meant to do this'." [...] Madonna later became the sole writer of five songs on her debut album, including [...] "Lucky Star" [...] which she composed on synthesizer. Rolling Stone has named her [...] "an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics." [...] According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing [...] "incredible" [...] hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music. As an example, Jarman-Ivens cites the 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and its line [...] "Live out your fantasy here with me, just let the music <b>set</b> <b>you</b> free; Touch my body, and move in time, now I know you're mine." [...] Though Madonna has worked with producers across many genres, her songs have been consistently stamped with her own sensibility and inflected with autobiographical detail. Some of her lyrics contain innuendos and double entendre, which led to multiple interpretations among music critics and scholars. Madonna has been nominated for being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame three times, for 2014, 2016 and 2017 ceremony. Rolling Stone listed Madonna at number 56 on the [...] "100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time".|$|E
