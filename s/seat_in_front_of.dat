25|$|Internal seating {{is made up}} of two pilot {{seats and}} {{additional}} seating for up to 13 passengers or crew in the cabin. The maximum seating arrangement consists of a four-man bench seat facing rearwards behind the pilot seats, facing a five-man bench <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the transmission structure, with two, two-man bench seats facing outwards from the transmission structure {{on either side of the}} aircraft. All passenger seats are constructed of aluminum tube frames with canvas material seats, and are quickly removable and reconfigurable. The cabin may also be configured with up to six stretchers, an internal rescue hoist, auxiliary fuel tanks, spotlights, or many other mission kits. Access to the cabin is via two aft-sliding doors and two small, forward-hinged panels. The doors and hinged panels may be removed for flight or the doors may be pinned open. Pilot access is via individual hinged doors.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} {{matters of}} the palace were in her charge. But {{she did not want}} to hurt anyone's feelings in the least, did not interfere in the matters, sought justice and equity, and because she was firmly religious she passed a good deal of time in prayers. She possessed good, high moral standards, which led her to help the poor and needy. When anyone went to see her, they would enter her presence in the same way they did the Sultan's, then take a <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> her. She would give them advice and treat them kindly. Perestu had a house in Maçka that Sultan Abdülaziz had presented to her at one time. Nowadays this villa is a school. Three days before Abdul Hamid became Sultan, he went to this villa, and it was from there that he proceeded to Topkapı Palace for the ceremony of homage at his accession. Abdul Hamid presented this villa of Perestu along with all its furniture and household goods to Ahmed Riza Bey, the speaker of Parliament.|$|E
500|$|This {{image was}} praised for its focus, {{and the empty}} bench <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the speaker is {{perceived}} as inviting to the viewer. [...] The solid dark background of the blackboard helps the subject to stand out but almost obscures Rockwell's signature. According to Deborah Solomon, the work [...] "imbues the speaker with looming tallness and requires his neighbors to literally look up to him." [...] The speaker represents a blue-collar unattached and sexually available, likely ethnic, threat to social customs who nonetheless is accorded the full respect from the audience. Some question the authenticity of white-collar residents being so attentive to the comments of their blue-collar brethren. The lack of female figures in the picture gives this an Elks club meeting feel rather than an open town meeting.|$|E

500|$|Through this passage, Bryan {{maintained}} {{the contrast between}} the common man and the city-dwelling elite. It was clear to listeners as he worked his way through the comparisons that he would refer to the farmer, and when he did, the hall exploded with sound. His sympathetic comparison contrasted the hardworking farmer with the city businessman, whom Bryan cast as a gambler. The galleries were filled with white as spectators waved handkerchiefs, and it was several minutes before he could continue. The police in the convention hall, not sharing the enthusiasm for silver, were described by the press (some of whose members were caught up in the frenzy) as standing as if they thought the audience was about to turn on them. When Bryan resumed, his comparison of miner with miser again electrified the audience; the uproar prevented him from continuing for several minutes. One farmer in the gallery had been about to leave rather than listen to Bryan, whom he deemed a Populist; he had been persuaded to stay. At Bryan's words, he threw his hat into the air, slapped the empty <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him with his coat, and shouted, [...] "My God! My God! My God!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Sb.1 had an {{open frame}} fuselage. A beam less than about [...] long {{served as a}} landing skid and {{supported}} the controls and the pilot's <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a square cross-section fairing which converged in boat-tail fashion in plan and elevation to a point only a short distance aft of the skid. [...] From the beam a pair of struts converged above the wing, the rear one almost vertical. Two pairs of steel tube struts, attached {{to the top and}} bottom of the rear upright, spread out into Vs to support the rectangular plan tailplane. The rest of the structure was wire-braced.|$|E
2500|$|The paramedic's {{body was}} found {{strapped}} in to his seat with a severe, possibly fatal, head injury from an impact {{against the back of}} the pilot's <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him. Despite the death of both occupants of the aircraft, the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, or AAIB, considered the impact survivable by the pilot. Had the paramedic been wearing a shoulder harness, the AAIB concluded it was likely that the paramedic would have survived the impact with the water with little or no injury, though it is possible he might then have succumbed to the cold water. The pilot, whose uninjured {{body was found}} nine months after the accident, and who had been wearing a shoulder harness, most likely survived the accident and escaped the aircraft, only to die of hypothermia in the cold water. As a result of this accident, regulations were enacted in 2015 by the European Union (EU) that require all aircraft of similar size that are used to transport passengers to be equipped with a shoulder harness, or [...] "upper torso restraint system" [...] (UTR system), for each passenger seat.|$|E
