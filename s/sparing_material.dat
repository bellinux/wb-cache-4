40|$|International audiencePurposeIn oropharyngeal cancer {{adaptive}} radiation therapy (ART), this study aimed {{to quantify the}} dosimetricbenefit of numerous replanning strategies, defined by various numbers and timings of replannings, withregard to parotid gland (PG) <b>sparing.</b> <b>Material</b> and methodsThirteen oropharyngeal cancer patients had one planning and then six weekly CT scans during the sevenweeks of IMRT. Weekly doses were recalculated without replanning or with replanning to spare the PG. Sixty-three ART scenarios were simulated by considering all the combinations of numbers and timings ofreplanning. The PG cumulated doses corresponding to “standard” IMRT and ART scenarios wereestimated and compared, either by calculating the average of weekly doses or using deformable imageregistration (DIR). ResultsConsidering average weekly doses, the mean PG overdose using standard IMRT, compared to the planneddose, was 4. 1 Gy. The mean dosimetric benefit of 6 replannings was 3. 3 Gy. Replanning at weeks 1, 1 - 5, 1 - 2 - 5, 1 - 2 - 4 - 5 and 1 - 2 - 4 - 5 - 6 produced the lowest PG mean doses, 94 % of the maximum benefit beingobtained with 3 replannings. The percentage of patients who had a benefit superior to 5 Gy for thecontralateral PG was 31 % for the three-replannings strategy. The same conclusions were found using DIR. ConclusionEarly replannings proved the most beneficial for PG sparing, three replannings (weeks 1 - 2 - 5),representing an attractive combination for ART in oropharyngeal cancer...|$|E
40|$|Introduction:Diagnosing non-small cell {{lung cancer}} on biopsy/cellblock samples by {{morphology}} may be demanding. As <b>sparing</b> <b>material</b> for molecular testing is mandatory, a minimalist immunohistochemistry (IHC) -based diagnostic approach is warranted {{by means of}} novel, reliable, and easy-to-assess biomarkers. Methods:Forty-six consecutive biopsy/cellblock samples and the corresponding resection specimens (as the gold standard for morphology and IHC) from 30 adenocarcinomas (AD), 10 squamous carcinomas (SQC), 5 adenosquamous carcinomas (ADSQC), and 1 sarcomatoid carcinoma (SC) were IHC-evaluated for p 40 [corresponding to nontransactivating ΔNp 63 isoforms] and thyroid transcription factor- 1 (TTF 1) by semiquantitative assessment. For p 40, also immunodecoration intensity was taken into account and dichotomized as strong or low. Results:Nonrandom and overlapping distributions of the relevant markers were found in biopsy/cellblock and surgical specimens, which closely correlated with each other and the diverse tumor categories, with no differences in area under curve-receiver-operating-characteristic curves for each marker between any two samples, including p 40 and p 63. Diagnostic combinations were p 40 −/TTF 1 + or TTF 1 − for AD (where p 40 was negative, apart from 5 / 30 AD showing at the best 1 – 2 % tumor cells with low intensity); p 40 +/TTF 1 − (p 40 strong and by far higher than 50 %) for SQC; and p 40 +/TTF 1 + or p 40 +/TTF 1 − (p 40 strong and less than 50 %) for ADSQC. The single SC case was p 40 −/TTF 1 −, suggesting glandular lineage. Practically, 41 / 46 (89 %) tumors were correctly classified by IHC on small samples, including 30 AD, 10 SQC, 1 / 5 ADSQC, and no SC. Underdiagnosis of ADSQC was actually because of sampling error of biopsies/cellblocks rather than insufficient biomarker robustness, whereas underdiagnosis of SC was really because of the failure of either marker to highlight epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Conclusions:This minimalist IHC-based model of p 40 and TTF 1 on biopsy/cellblock samples was effective to correctly subtype most cases of lung cancer...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundRadical {{surgical}} excision is {{the treatment}} of choice in all medullary thyroid carcinomas. External beam radiotherapy for medullary thyroid carcinoma is necessary in advanced cases. Unfortunately, a large volume {{of the head and}} neck region which has to be irradiated is close to critical structures such as the spinal cord, larynx, and parotid glands, which creates a challenge during radiotherapy planning. AimThe aim of the study is to compare IMRT and 3 D plans of patients diagnosed with medullary thyroid carcinoma in terms of CTV coverage and normal tissue <b>sparing.</b> <b>Materials</b> and MethodsA 46 -year-old woman with medullary thyroid carcinoma, stage pT 4 a N 1 b M 0, underwent radical resection, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy to a total dose 60 Gy to the clinical target volume (CTV). Three plans were generated to irradiate the thyroid bed and regional lymph nodes. Two intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3 DRT) plans were compared in terms of CTV coverage and organ at risk sparing. ResultsUsing the IMRT plans we achieved more homogeneous dose distribution with higher minimal dose and lower maximal dose in the target volume compared to 3 DRT technique. Furthermore, mean and maximal dose to critical structures were lower when IMRT was applied compared to 3 DRT. ConclusionsIMRT results in improved dose distribution within CTV compared to 3 DRT. With the IMRT plan it is also possible to reduce the dose to the organ at risk, especially the larynx, salivary glands and spinal cord...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the success rate}} of Bakri balloon tamponade (BBT) for managing postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), intractable to conservative medical treatment, as a fertility <b>sparing</b> intervention. <b>Materials</b> and methods: We evaluated 47 women treated with BBT who had severe postpartum hemorrhage and uncontrollable bleeding due to failed treatment with uterotonic agents. The main outcome measure was successful management and preservation of the uterus. Results: Forty-seven women were identified for BBT treatment due to severe PPH. BBT was used to successfully manage hemorrhage in 43 patients, {{and there was no}} need for hysterectomy. Four patients required an additional surgical procedure. Of the four failures, a subtotal hysterectomy was performed in two patients, and the other two patients underwent a total hysterectomy. The overall success rate was 91. 4 %, which was comparable to rates reported earlier. The main cause of PPH was uterine atony (43 %). Conclusion: Uterine preservation is an important issue when managing PPH. BBT is an effective, easy to use, and safe procedure for massive PPH that can minimize recourse to hysterectomy after failed medical treatment...|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} located {{in the eastern part of}} the city, on Tătărași Hill. An earlier church existed on the site; it was built of wood by the pious {{daughter}} of a boyar in memory of the fact that in 1402, during the reign of Alexander the Good, Saint John's relics stopped in the area on the way into the city. The present church was built between 1626 and 1629, on the ruins of the old one. Its ktitor was hetman Nicoară, adviser and brother-in-law to Prince Miron Barnovschi-Movilă; the co-founder was his wife Todosia. Two legends surround the building of the church. One holds that Miron asked Nicoară to supervise construction of the Barnovschi Church. Finding out that the latter was <b>sparing</b> with <b>materials,</b> intending to use leftovers in order to build his own church, the prince ordered him sealed alive into the walls of his church. Another states that the prince was envious of Nicoară's church and thus refused his permission for it to be blessed.|$|R

40|$|Purpose Although most Leydig cell {{tumors are}} benign, radical {{orchiectomy}} is currently considered the standard therapy. We retrospectively analyzed the long-term followup {{of a series}} of patients with Leydig cell tumors electively treated with testis <b>sparing</b> surgery. <b>Materials</b> and Methods Between November 1990 and December 2005, 17 consecutive patients with Leydig cell tumors underwent testis sparing surgery on an elective basis. Preoperative evaluation included physical examination, serum markers for germ cell tumors, scrotal ultrasound, abdominal computerized tomography, chest x-ray and hormonal profile if clinically required. Testis sparing surgery was performed via an inguinal approach with spermatic cord clamping. Frozen section examination was performed in all cases, revealing Leydig cell tumors. Followup consisted of physical examination, scrotal ultrasound, abdominal computerized tomography and chest x-ray every 6 months for the first 2 years, then annually. Tumor recurrence and survival were evaluated. Results Mean patient age was 41. 6 years (range 28 to 55). Medical referral was prompted by symptoms/signs such as infertility, gynecomastia or self-palpation of scrotal mass in 11 patients (64. 7 %), while in the remaining 6 (35. 3 %) the lesions were incidentally diagnosed. Hormonal profile was performed in 9 patients, showing abnormalities in all. Mean tumor diameter was 13. 4 mm (range 5 to 31). Definitive pathological examination confirmed benign Leydig cell tumor in all cases. After a mean followup of 91 months (range 12 to 192), neither local recurrence nor distant metastases have been detected and all patients are alive without evidence of disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} explores the {{relationship}} between human REM sleep and time-dependent memory consolidation processes. Specifically, {{it was hypothesized that}} differential effects on retention produced by post-learning REM sleep deprivation may be explained in terms of neuropsychological dissociations of task requirements. In order to test this possibility, a variety of memory tasks were assembled to be representative of subsets within both explicit/declarative and implicit/procedural domains. These include: Word Recognition, Word Fragment Completion, Tower of Hanoi, Corsi Block-Tapping Task, and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure. Thirty-five undergraduate students from Trent University, Peterborough served as subjects. Subjects were presented with the stimulus materials in the evening, followed by random assignment to one of five sleep conditions: (1) Selective REM Sleep Deprivation; (2) Non-REM Sleep Deprivation; (3) Total Sleep Deprivation; (4) Lab Recorded Controls; or (5) Normally Rested Controls. Subjects were post-tested with the same materials after a 1 -week retention interval. Results indicated that selective REM sleep deprivation following learning impaired retention of implicit priming and cognitive procedural learning while <b>sparing</b> explicit/declarative <b>material.</b> Results are discussed within a variety of theoretical frameworks, including distinct memory systems theories and accounts derived from the area of human information processing.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the study}} was is to assess the {{incidence}} of unexpected gynecological cancers and pre-cancerous lesions following hysterectomy for pelvic organ prolapse to better understand the risks of uterine <b>sparing</b> surgery. <b>Material</b> and Method: This was a retrospective analysis of histopathology findings after hysterectomy for uterine prolapse surgery who underwent preoperative diagnostic work including cervical cytology, transvaginal ultrasonography and endometrial histopathological examination for a high risk group (Postmenopausal women with an endometrial thickness of %u 22655 mm and premenopausal women with abnormal bleeding). Patients with a history of endometrial, cervical and/or adnexal precancerous or cancerous pathological conditions and with incomplete medical records were excluded. Results: Results were taken from 106 women who underwent hysterectomy. The abdominal route was used in 22 cases (21. 7 %), the vaginal route in 82 patients (77. 4 %) and laparoscopic-assisted vaginal route in two (1. 9 %) women. Oophorectomy was performed in 35 (33 %) cases. None of the patients had malignant histopathology specimens from hysterectomy. Total premalignant pathology incidence was 7. 5 % (8 / 106). Six (5. 7 %) patients had simple endometrial hyperplasia and 2 patients (1. 9 %) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Discussion: The incidence of unexpected endometrial, cervical or ovarian malignancy among women who underwent hysterectomy after preoperative diagnostic workup including transvaginal ultrasonograhy, endometrial pathological examination to high risk cases was negligible. The inclusion of low risk endometrial and cervical precancerous lesions increased the incidences. Our results could provide precious data to extrapolate to similar populations with uterine prolapse who desire surgical correction sparing uterus...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: Radiotherapy (RT) of {{rectal cancer}} is {{challenged}} by potentially large inter-fractional anatomy changes. The risk of radiation-induced morbidity {{is a particular}} concern in patients receiving re-irradiation for recurrent disease. We propose an adaptive RT plan selection strategy for these patients and report on its clinical feasibility and normal tissue <b>sparing</b> potential. <b>Material</b> and methods: Eight patients with pelvic recurrence were re-irradiated according to a hyper-fractionation protocol (ReRAD-I; 40. 8  Gy) using margins around the clinical target volume (CTV) of 15  mm trimmed to anatomical barriers (Plan L). Two new library plans (S and M) were created for each patient, with the target volumes covering the CTV with isotropic margins of 5 and 10  mm. Pre-treatment cone beam CTs were assessed to determine which plan would cover the CTV following soft-tissue match. The selected plans were compared to the clinically delivered plan in terms of normal tissue volume receiving 95 % of the dose (V 95 %) and the volume of bone receiving 30  Gy (V 30  Gy). Results: Plan selections could be performed on all CBCTs for all patients. Plan S was chosen in 213 fractions (79 %), plan M in 53 (20 %) and plan L in 2 fractions. Normal tissue V 95 % was reduced by 67 % (median; range 30 – 79 %) while bone V 30  Gy was reduced by 66 % (median; range 40 – 100 %). Conclusion: The CTV and/or surrogate structures were visible on all CBCTs. Margins smaller than those used clinically would have accounted for 99 % of the observed target deformations, translating into a considerable normal tissue sparing potential...|$|R
40|$|The way {{in which}} {{pharmaceutical}} products are being developed and manufactured is changing as the focus is shifting to understand the link between material properties and manufacturing processes on critical quality attributes. However, with the increased cost of developing new products companies {{are looking for ways}} to expedite the development process while using less active pharmaceutical ingredient. In order to accomplish the desired state of development and manufacture, the use of <b>material</b> <b>sparing</b> techniques is on the rise. In addition, the use of process analytical technologies allow for real-time monitoring and control of critical material properties to ensure critical quality attributes of the product is met. Through the use of surrogate samples and near infrared spectroscopy it is possible to develop a robust and repeatable roller compaction process using the concepts of quality by design. ^ This study investigates the use of surrogate compacts to develop robust and accurate near infrared spectroscopic chemometric models to predict roller compacted ribbon density. Also, the use of near infrared spectroscopy to identify and monitor the causes of the three dimensional density distribution of roller compacted ribbons in real-time using a multipoint fiber optic probe. Next, this study uses surrogate compacts to understand the impact of compact density on milled granule particle size distribution, granule bulk density, and final tablet tensile strength. The surrogate compact data is then used to predict the impact of the observed three dimensional roller compacted ribbon density distribution on these critical material attributes. Finally, this study discusses the future of pharmaceutical manufacturing in the desired state using the findings from the three studies to develop a robust and repeatable roller compaction process. ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{report on}} the {{potential}} benefits of swallowing-sparing intensity-modulated radiation therapy (SW-IMRT) in the first 100 SW-IMRT treated patients, {{as well as on the}} factors that influence the potential benefit of SW-IMRT relative to standard parotid <b>sparing</b> (ST) -IMRT. <b>MATERIAL</b> AND METHODS: One hundred consecutive head and neck cancer patients, scheduled for primary radiotherapy, were included in this prospective cohort study. For each patient, ST-IMRT and SW-IMRT treatment plans were created. All patients were eventually treated with SW-IMRT. Objectives for SW-IMRT were identical to those with ST-IMRT, with additional objectives to spare the swallowing organs at risk (SWOARs). After 20 patients, interim results were evaluated by a multidisciplinary committee. RESULTS: The mean gain of SW-IMRT relative to ST-IMRT in the first 20 patients was less than expected based on our previous planning comparative study. A critical review of all plans revealed that the results with SW-IMRT could be improved by: (1) gaining experience and attempting to reduce SWOAR dose as much as possible; (2) accepting a moderate shift of dose to unspecified tissues; (3) maximizing SWOAR sparing while keeping PTV coverage exactly according to protocol. In the additional 80 patients, the mean dose to the various SWOARs was further reduced significantly compared to ST-IMRT. Dose reductions with SW-IMRT were largest for patients who received neck irradiation, had a tumour located in the larynx, oropharynx, nasopharynx or oral cavity, and had < 75 % overlap between SWOARs and PTVs. The mean absolute reduction in predicted physician-rated RTOG grade 2 - 4 swallowing dysfunction for patients numbered 21 - 100 was 6. 1 %, ranging from 0. 0 % to 17. 2 %. CONCLUSIONS: The benefit of SW-IMRT depends significantly on neck radiotherapy, tumour site and the amount of overlap between SWOARs and PTVs. Optimal clinical introduction requires a detailed evaluation and comparison between the standard (ST-IMRT) and new technique (SW-IMRT) in order to fully exploit the potential benefits...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We {{describe}} the clinical and pathological outcomes of intraoperative frozen sections {{performed on the}} posterolateral prostate margins during nerve <b>sparing</b> radical prostatectomy. <b>Materials</b> and Methods: We developed a technique of bilateral nerve sparing, inking the posterolateral prostate margins and obtaining frozen sections. When tumor was seen on frozen section, the fascia and neurovascular bundle were widely excised before completing the vesi-courethral anastomosis. We reviewed 142 radical retropubic prostatectomies performed by a single surgeon between 1992 and 1997. Patients were divided into group 1 —nerve sparing procedure using our technique (48 patients), 2 —planned unilateral nerve sparing without frozen sections (46) and 3 —planned bilateral nerve sparing without frozen sections (48). Potency was measured implicitly by physician assessment and explicitly with the UCLA Prostate Cancer Index. Group comparisons were made for positive margins, biochemical recurrence and potency. Mean followup was 24. 5, 43. 8 and 39. 4 months for groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Results: Of the 48 group 1 patients 9 (18 %) had adenocarcinoma in the frozen section specimen, prompting wide excision of the bundles. None of these patients had biochemical recurrence during a mean followup of 20. 5 months. Both bundles were spared in the remaining 39 patients (82 %). There {{was no difference in}} survival or time to biochemical recurrence between groups 1 and 2. Potency was significantly different between groups 1 and 2 (36 versus 13 %, p 5 0. 001), even after age adjustment (p 5 0. 05). In contrast, potency did not differ between groups 1 and 3 (38 versus 40 %). Preoperative stage, grade and prostate specific antigen level were similar among the 3 groups. Conclusions: We found a significant difference in potency rates adjusted for age between patients with and without frozen sections. Our results indicate that this technique can enhance the ability of the surgeon to monitor the nerve sparing procedure without compromising cancer control...|$|R
