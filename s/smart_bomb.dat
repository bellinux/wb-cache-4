500|$|In 2005, {{the entire}} fleet of 356 A-10 and OA-10 {{aircraft}} began receiving the Precision Engagement upgrades including an improved fire control system (FCS), electronic countermeasures (ECM), and <b>smart</b> <b>bomb</b> targeting. The aircraft receiving this upgrade were redesignated A-10C. The Government Accounting Office in 2007 estimated {{the cost of}} upgrading, refurbishing, and service life extension plans for the A-10 force to total $2.25billion through 2013. [...] In July 2010, the USAF issued Raytheon a contract to integrate a Helmet Mounted Integrated Targeting (HMIT) system into the A-10C. The Air Force Material Command's Ogden Air Logistics Center at Hill AFB, Utah completed work on its 100th A-10 precision engagement upgrade in January 2008. [...] The final aircraft was upgraded to A-10C configuration in June 2011. [...] The aircraft also received all-weather combat capability, and a Hand-on-Throttle-and-Stick configuration mixing the F-16's flight stick with the F-15's throttle. [...] Other changes included two multifunction displays, a modern communications suite including a Link-16 radio and SATCOM.
