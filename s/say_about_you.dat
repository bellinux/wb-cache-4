500|$|After {{enduring}} {{three years}} of [...] "carping" [...] from critics, Carey planned her return to music. On November 18, 2004, she revealed on her website that {{the name of the}} album would be The Emancipation of Mimi. While Carey was recording the album, Island Records executive L.A. Reid had learned that close friends referred to the singer as [...] "Mimi". He had told Carey, [...] "I feel your spirit on this record. You should use that name in the title, because that's the fun side of you that people don't get to see â€“ the side that can laugh at the diva jokes, laugh at the breakdown jokes, laugh at whatever they want to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> and just live life and enjoy it." [...] Carey explained that Mimi is a [...] "very personal nickname" [...] only used by those in her inner circle, and thus the title meant she was letting her guard down and inviting her fans to be that much closer to her. She thought that naming her album The Emancipation of Mariah Carey would be [...] "obnoxious".|$|E

6000|$|Then she seated {{herself and}} read it, almost trembling, however, {{as she went}} on with it. [...] "Oh dear;--that is very nice what he <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> and Mary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you're {{talking as}} if I {{was going to}} do it," [...] objected Mr. Foss. [...] "I wish you'd go and 'ave your fortune told. Go and see what she <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>you.</b> P'r'aps you won't believe so much in fortune-telling afterwards." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "My {{husband has}} died and I have no son. They <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> {{that you have}} many sons. You might give me one of your sons to become my husband. I would not wish {{to take one of}} my {{subjects}} as a husband... I am afraid." ...|$|E
5000|$|Here's {{what other}} people are <b>saying</b> <b>about</b> Before <b>You</b> Know It: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{anxious to}} hear what Mr. Grosse <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> to-morrow," [...] the old lady began. [...] "I shall insist on his giving me a far more {{complete}} report of you than he gave last time. The recovery of your sight appears to me, my dear, to be quite complete." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Conqueror's sailing to-morrow morning, too," [...] {{continued}} his tormentor; [...] "his father's old ship. 'Ow strange it'll seem to 'im following it out aboard a whaler. Life is full o' surprises, Mr. Wilks, and wot {{a big surprise}} {{it would be to}} you if you could 'ear wot he <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> when he comes to 'is senses." ...|$|R
6000|$|RAMSDEN. Oh, {{that was}} his partiality: we were very old friends, you know. But there was {{something}} else he used to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>you.</b> I wonder whether I ought to tell you or not! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, my own one, what am I to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> and of myself, as {{your husband}} {{that is to}} be? Will you wait, at any rate, for three years with the {{conviction}} that the three years will too probably end in your having to wait again? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's right. I decla'e, you've got moa judgment! That's what I used to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> last summa to my husband: she's got judgment. Well, what's wanted?" [...] Mrs. Atwell {{spoke to}} her husband, who had opened her door and looked in, and she stopped rocking, while she waited his answer.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, decidedly! and devilish {{personal}} too; {{some people}} wouldn't like it. I {{have no doubt}} she will <b>say</b> something <b>about</b> <b>you</b> next." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} Mr. Britling <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> in his 'American Impressions,'" [...] she said. [...] "He says that America overdoes the {{development}} of personalities altogether, that whatever else is wrong about America that is where America is most clearly wrong. I read that this morning, and directly I read it I thought, 'Yes, that's exactly it! Mr. Direck is overdoing the development of personalities.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|At parting, Eliza {{said to the}} girl, [...] "What do {{you think}} I heard {{somebody}} <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>you?</b> That {{it was enough to}} make anybody's eyes start square out of their head to look at such red cheeks as yours." [...] Whereupon the girl turned off the compliment with a laugh, and took her leave.|$|E
6000|$|... "To be sure; Anneke had {{something}} to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> though {{it was so much}} out of the way, I can hardly tell you what it was now. Oh! I remember: she said 'I have seen Mr. Littlepage, and think he has grown since we last met; he promises to make a man one of these days.' What could t'at mean, Corny?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{only one}} way to stop me," [...] Tudor went on. [...] "I can't insult you directly, I know. You are too easy-going, or cowardly, or both, for that. But I can narrate for you the talk of the beach--ah, that grinds you, doesn't it? I can tell you what the beach has to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> and this young girl running a {{plantation}} under a business partnership." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Jove, there'll be a fair-sized row about this. The Old Man's on to {{trespassing}} like tar. I say, think Plunkett'll <b>say</b> anything <b>about</b> <b>you</b> {{being there}} too?' ...|$|R
500|$|On February 15, {{before an}} {{appearance}} on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Vilsack visited the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco where he gave a speech about energy. He explained that his campaign remained carbon neutral through the purchase of carbon credits. On The Tonight Show, Vilsack joked about his relative obscurity. He remarked that he was okay with Leno making jokes about him, because [...] "when you are just below {{the margin of error}} in polls, anything anybody <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> is important." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I see. Well, {{before you}} decide to go I'd {{like to have a}} little talk with you. My {{daughter}} has told me part of what happened to you on the trail. I want to know all of it. You're young, but you've been out in the world, and you know what people can <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> and my girl." [...] His voice became level and menacing, as he added: [...] "And I don't intend to have her put in wrong on account of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Damn it! Sir," [...] {{he exclaimed}} once, [...] "do {{you mean to}} tell me that you never overdraw your allowance? It is not natural; almost wrong indeed. I wonder what your secret vices are? Well, so long as you keep them secret, you ought to be a big man one day and end up in a very {{different}} position to George Cubitte--called a General--who never saw a shot fired in his life. There'll be lots of them flying about before you're old, my boy, and doubtless you'll get your share of gunpowder--or nitro-glycerine--if you go on as you have begun. If I weren't afraid of making you cocky, I'd tell you what they <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> down at that Sandhurst shop, where I have an old pal or two." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Porter was {{especially}} interested in everything I had to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> and asked many questions. I am afraid I took a rather unchivalrous delight in picturing your desire and resolve to go back eventually to your native jungle. I was sorry afterward, for it did seem to cause her real anguish to contemplate the awful dangers to which you wished to return. [...] "And yet," [...] she said, [...] "I do not know. There are more unhappy fates than the grim and terrible jungle presents to Monsieur Tarzan. At least his conscience will be free from remorse. And there are moments of quiet and restfulness by day, and vistas of exquisite beauty. You may find it strange that I should say it, who experienced such terrifying experiences in that frightful forest, yet at times I long to return, for I cannot but feel that the happiest moments of my life were spent there." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This evening," [...] {{she said}} slowly, [...] "he is coming down. I was {{thinking}} {{it all over}} this afternoon. I had {{made up my mind}} to <b>say</b> nothing <b>about</b> <b>you.</b> Since you came, however, I feel differently. I shall tell him everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you must}} have {{something}} to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it, mamma. <b>You</b> must bring yourself {{to have something to}} say,--to have a great deal to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was all so}} different, Granville," [...] he said to {{his friend}} confidentially, as they paced the deck after supper, cigar in mouth, [...] "when you first went out, and we didn't know one another. Then, I distrusted you, and you distrusted me. We didn't {{understand}} one another's characters. But now we can settle it all as a family affair. Men who have camped out together under the open sky on the African veldt, who have run the gauntlet of Korannas and Barolong and Namaqua, who have stood by one another in sickness and in fight, needn't be afraid of disagreeing about their money matters in England. Cyril will meet us to-morrow and talk it all over, and I'm not the least troubled about the result, either for you or for him. The same blood runs in all our veins alike. Whatever you propose, he'll be ready to agree to. He's the very best fellow that ever lived, and when he hears what I have to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> he'll welcome you as a brother, and be as fond of you as I am." ...|$|E
5000|$|Q: Why {{is there}} such a great contradiction between what you say about {{yourself}} and what your followers <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>you?</b> ...|$|E

5000|$|... "As I {{understand}} it, cladistics is theoretically neutral {{so far as}} {{evolution is}} concerned. It has nothing to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> evolution. <b>You</b> donâ€™t {{need to know about}} evolution, or believe in it, to do cladistic analysis. All that cladistics demands is that groups have characters." [...] (Patterson, 1981) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{according}} to what Rear Admiral Sampson has to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it, lad. <b>You</b> see, this campaign in Atlantic waters is largely in his hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If the {{presence}} of Sir Timothy be an allurement to you, I pity you indeed. I have nothing further to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>You</b> have ruined your brother."
