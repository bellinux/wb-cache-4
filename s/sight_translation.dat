40|$|As an {{interpreter}} {{for the past}} 14 years {{in the legal system}} in Nebraska I have had the unique opportunity to work in many different situations. I’ve interpreted for attorney/client interviews, depositions, mental health hearings, Workers’ Compensation Court, divorce and child support hearings, and criminal trials. Not only do I use my oral skills; I also perform <b>sight</b> <b>translations</b> and do written translations of documents. If you have not worked with {{an interpreter}} in your practice, given the changes in Nebraska’s demographics, you undoubtedly will find yourself in need of one at some time during your career. Nebraska {{is becoming more and more}} culturally diverse with each passing year and the need for interpreters grows exponentially as well. Ken Wade of the Administrative Office of Courts maintains an extensive list of interpreters that you may access when you find yourself in need of a language service provider. Wade can be reached at (402) 472 - 2671. Nebraska is a member of the National Consortium for State Certification of Court Interpreters. The Consortium is a multi-state partnership dedicated to developing court inter-preter proficiency tests. The Consortium defines and imple-ments standards for identifying proficient, qualified interpreters. 1 At present, this is the only certification available to interpreters in Nebraska. Only 13 interpreters have passed the test and received certification since the test was first offered in 2000. The Court Administrators Office provides an orientation and skills building workshop each year in order to help new and working interpreters pass the test. The Nebraska Association for Translators and Interpreters (NATI) is also a valuable resource to interpreters, providing training and support for the profession. The Nebraska Supreme Court as well as the Minority and Justice Implementation Committee have worked diligently to establish policies that regulate the use of interpreters in the courts and guarantee that only the most qualified persons interpret in a legal setting. What IS a Qualified Court Interpreter? A qualified court interpreter is someone who possesses an exceptional command of two languages, oral and written, has an in-depth knowledge of legal terminology and concepts, and the unique ability to make language conversion second nature...|$|R

40|$|Translation is now {{a highly}} technologized {{professional}} practice. The use of computer-assisted translation (CAT) tools has become the norm, {{to the extent that}} almost every translation commissioner expects translators to master such technology. Understandably, universities have been making countless efforts to adapt their translation curriculum to this new reality. The dynamics of the translation technology market −new version releases, emergence of new tools− often motivate changes in CAT tool-oriented courses from one academic year to another, rendering it sometimes difficult to be in line with most recent trends. The preparation of CAT tool lab sessions becomes even more demanding when screen users, often visually-impaired, are part of the audience. Over the last years, members of the blind community have increasingly enrolled in and successfully completed higher-education translation programmes. As a result, their presence has become more noticeable within translator networks, with many of them joining the pools of international organisations and the European Commission. In this communication paper, we aim at examining the major challenges faced by blind translators when entering the professional market, particularly regarding the use of CAT tools. The ultimate goal is to study (i) which tools are better suited for them and (ii) which resources exist to overcome current accessibility barriers in the use of translation technology. The latter would, in turn, provide insight into how to adapt the methodology followed in CAT tools teaching to jointly meet the needs and expectations of both blind and <b>sighted</b> <b>translation</b> trainees. To accomplish the above, we have complemented our knowledge as accessibility, screen reader software and translation technology experts with data gathered from a comprehensive survey targeting visually¬ impaired translation professionals. The call for participation was advertised through The Round Table mailing list, the leading information exchange hub for visually impaired translators and interpreters. Preliminary findings from 35 respondents suggest that recent versions of the most popular CAT tools, including SDL software, are substantially less accessible than previous ones. Similarly, while scripting techniques are often referred to as a means to bypass inaccessible features, they are not seen as a sustainable solution. Above all, Fluency stands as the CAT tool that yielded the highest satisfaction rates; yet, blind translators feel that mastering this tool only is not enough to meet current translation job requirements. In this perspective, we believe that, if compliant with accessibility standards, the new generation of web-based tools could empower visually-impaired translators to enter the job market under similar working conditions as their sighted peers...|$|R
40|$|This study {{represents}} {{an analysis of}} the use of foreign African interpreters in South African courtrooms {{in the context of the}} necessity of court interpreting as a vehicle through which accused persons can express themselves in defence of their rights, which may have been violated. As a background to the study, due consideration is given to the history of interpreting, followed by some theoretical perspectives of interpreting, where the differences between translation and interpreting are explained. The discussion of some of the theoretical issues of interpreting also focuses on the notion of equivalence, and the divergent views of scholars regarding this notion, which range from formal equivalence (a source-language oriented approach), through dynamic equivalence (in terms of which translation/interpreting must be in agreement with the form and cultural expectations of the receptor language community) to skopos theory (functional in approach and target text oriented). In discussing the role of the court interpreter, the role boundaries with regard to his/her professional relationship with other participants in the courtroom are highlighted. A related topic, namely that of quality in interpreting, is investigated in relation to quality control by professional associations in different countries, who act as regulatory authorities in this regard. A review of court interpreting in South Africa and selected countries in Africa and the EU, such as Nigeria, Benin, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Mozambique and Portugal reveals that efforts to develop court interpreting in some Africa and EU countries are either non-existent or at an incipient stage of development. While South Africa, compared to other countries in Africa, is making progress, she is far behind EU countries such as the UK, France and Spain –all of which possess accreditation systems, professional associations and registers of court interpreters. An analysis of the data collected on foreign African court interpreters shows that, although they work in the same courtrooms as their South African counterparts on a daily basis, they are treated differently in terms of employment procedures, training, remuneration, and such like. The study points out that some factors such as (a) the lack of adequate crosscultural awareness and (b) of a balanced proficiency in their language pair, as well as (c) and the existence of divergent dialects in those languages may pose a challenge to foreign African court interpreters in interpreting cross-border languages and in performing <b>sight</b> <b>translations.</b> The study further reveals that foreign African court interpreters are in serious breach of the professional code of conduct, as exemplified by instances of conflict of interest and partiality in their practices. As regards the management of court interpreters, the findings indicate a general laxity on the side of management, as a result of which there is a lack, inter alia, of an appropriate evaluation or monitoring strategy aimed at detecting such cases of conflict of interest and partialit...|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{importance}} of <b>sight</b> for the <b>translation</b> process, particularly for descriptions. Goethe’s concept of Anschauung, a sort of inner sight, of an intuitive perception, appears {{very important for the}} translator, who must re-live the situations he has to translate with his inner eye. An example from Goethe’s “Sufferings of the Young Werther” and of four different translations are presented and commented on. An further example from Joachim Sartorius’ “Mein Zypern” shows the difficulty of translating the description of a mosaic without seeing the real mosaic. Moreover, witnessing a scene with the inner eye is important for the reformulation of the tense Präteritum from German into Italian, particularly for the decision of interpreting a scene as a momentaneous or a repetitive one. In conclusion, translation teaching must encourage students’ awareness that translation is an activity demanding not only language and encyclopedic knowledge, but the activation of sight and probably of other senses too...|$|R
40|$|Every {{year the}} Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI) conducts {{approximately}} 10, 000 interpreter-mediated asylum interviews in Norway. Each asylum interview {{ends with the}} interpreter providing a <b>sight</b> <b>translation</b> of the draft interview report (an oral translation of the text) to the asylum seeker. The UDI wished {{to find out why}} some interpreters took so much more time than others for <b>sight</b> <b>translation.</b> In response, Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences initiated a pilot project. The project’s working hypothesis was that slow <b>sight</b> <b>translation</b> was due mainly to a combination of three factors: interpreters’ poor reading skills; interpreters’ poor interpreting techniques; and/or interpreters’ unfamiliarity with the appropriate genre/style. A more complex picture emerged, however, from an analysis of 13 asylum interviews; group work involving 108 UDI interpreters; and discussions with UDI specialists. An asylum report is the joint product of all the participants in an asylum interview, who are typically the asylum seeker, the interviewer and the interpreter. The pilot study showed that each participant could contribute in various ways to slowing the speed of <b>sight</b> <b>translation.</b> Contributing factors identified that were unrelated to the interpreter included the interviewer’s competence in interview techniques; the interviewer’s competence in creating a written record of speech; the asylum seeker’s narrative ability; and the asylum seeker’s ability to correct mistakes in the draft report. All these factors may have just as much impact on the speed of <b>sight</b> <b>translation</b> as the interpreter’s competence. In addition, the physical strain caused by the length of asylum interviews (six hours plus) and the emotional stress potentially caused by such institutional interviews may affect the communicative abilities of all participants.

The analysis of data indicates that student interpreting performances mostly depend on literal and word-for-word translation in which they have difficulties to free themselves from the context and form of the source language. In other words, they seem to have problems with “deverbalization” (Seleskovitch 1975; Donovan- Cagigos 1990).

The term prima facie is used in modern legal English (including both civil law and criminal law) to signify that upon initial examination, sufficient corroborating evidence appears to exist to support a case. In common law jurisdictions, prima facie denotes evidence that, unless rebutted, would be sufficient to prove a particular proposition or fact. The term is used similarly in academic philosophy.

40|$|At a nexus between {{translation}} studies and didactics, {{the teaching of}} <b>sight</b> <b>translation</b> within the parameters of a foreign language course has as its primary aim to improve the communication skills of foreign language learners {{in general and of}} French learners at the University of Pretoria in particular. Contrary to the communication process in their first and second languages, students who try to speak a foreign language such as French are unable to express their thoughts freely. To compensate for their insufficient language knowledge and intuition, they tend to rely on their other languages as a reference for all communication. Although this natural reflex is part of the learning process, students' attempts to transfer words, phrases, and rules directly from one language to another can be detrimental to language performance. The problem does not lie in the fact that they translate mentally before speaking, but that they tend to translate literally. This is a highly inefficient communication strategy that results in a non-idiomatic, imperfect reflection of students’ actual knowledge of language. Unlike the above-mentioned mental transcoding and the so-called pedagogical translation generally practiced in the language class, the interpretive translation approach focuses on the reexpression of the meaning of the original text. This professional translation approach should be applied to all translation, including translation in the language class. Although the purpose is not to train professional translators or interpreters, students still need to learn to translate intelligently, whether verbally or mentally, without literally reproducing their reference languages. Since students are even more tempted than professionals to rely on the source language due to their limited language knowledge, they should explicitly learn to look for alternative means of expression available to them instead of transcoding this language. <b>Sight</b> <b>translation</b> is a very economical technique to teach this approach in language classes, as students learn to translate in their own words, using all their communication skills. Students learn how best to convey the meaning of the source text with the limited vocabulary and grammar skills at their disposal. When speaking, they also focus on the meaning of their utterances and use compensatory strategies when faced with a language problem, instead of copying from their reference languages or avoiding the problem altogether by switching to another language. In the space of little more than a year, the majority of the forty-four students who participated in the empirical research learned to communicate in a natural and authentic manner without undue interference from their other languages (mainly English). Those who have mastered the approach increasingly use efficient strategies to overcome language shortcomings, thus abandoning formal transfer to the benefit of their oral expression. In addition, a small number of talented students were identified to engage in further specialised translation and interpretation training. In conclusion, <b>sight</b> <b>translation</b> teaching in the classroom proved to be a highly beneficial method to improve translation and communication skills among French foreign language learners in the multicultural environment of the University of Pretoria.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis presents {{an analysis of}} the multitasking processes involved in musical accompaniment and simultaneous interpretation. The analysis incorporates the study of theoretical models and adopts as a framework three comparative scenarios: sight-reading versus <b>sight</b> <b>translation,</b> sight-read musical accompaniment versus simultaneous interpretation with text and improvised musical accompaniment versus simultaneous interpretation without text. In addition, the description of the teaching methods used at four music training institutions provides details of the training regimens that enable students to acquire the required skills of sight-reading, musical accompaniment and improvisation. The empirical part includes a quantitative comparison of the multitasking ability of students who have undergone different types of musical and language training. The results show that students with musical background outperform those without such background on a multitasking test, while students with better knowledge of their first foreign language outperformed those without such knowledge on a simultaneous interpretation test...|$|E

Nevertheless, in interpreter training programs and assessments, reading skills seem so far to have been taken for granted. In this article we discuss reading skills for <b>sight</b> <b>translation</b> and suggest a way of testing these skills. Furthermore, we {{argue that there is}} a need to rethink assessments and educational programmes based on an assumption of skills in reading. We base our arguments on a study of public-sector interpreters’ reading speeds in Norwegian. The results show that 70 % of the interpreters tested did not have sufficient skills in one central component of reading, namely decoding; that there is vast variation in skills; and that decoding speed varies according to the interpreters’ linguistic backgrounds. Our results are a strong indication of a specific need for training in reading skills amongst many public-sector interpreters...|$|E
40|$|In three {{experiments}} {{we examined}} the effect of schema activation on professional translators who had to read and translate or to read aloud visually presented texts. In Experiment 1, text understanding was improved by presenting a summary before reading aloud the texts. However, prior presentation of the summary reduced comprehension when participants had to translate them (<b>sight</b> <b>translation).</b> The interfering effect of prior summary was replicated in semi-consecutive translation (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, we explored {{the nature of this}} paradoxical effect by manipulating the working memory (WM) load associated with reading. When WM load increased, the benefit associated with the presentation of the summary in reading disappeared. These results are discussed in terms of a cost/benefit hypothesis of schema activation during understanding. The implications for the training of translators are also evaluated. Reading comprehension is a cognitively demanding task which requires use of the Working Memory system (WM). In fact, virtually all models of language comprehension assume the relevance of this system t...|$|E
40|$|In this article, a {{case study}} is {{presented}} that demonstrates the potential of a new <b>sight</b> <b>translation</b> (ST) teaching technique for simultaneous interpreting (SI) training. By using animated, time-controlled PowerPoint presentations instead of texts on paper, this method induces constraints such as time pressure and attention splitting, thus making ST essentially an on-line information processing activity, closely resembling SI. Apart from reviewing how to design the method, the author compares it with the two existing methods (i. e., ST with prior reading and ST without prior reading), makes some hypothetical analysis of its functionality in SI training, and discusses some preliminary research findings from using the technique. The author argues that the simulated SI-related constraints, which the traditional ST methods cannot provoke, are helpful in enhancing students’ awareness and acquisition of SI-related skills and strategies for SI training, hoping that the case study can arouse more interest in future empirical investigation. 15 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Think-aloud {{protocols}} {{have been}} used for decades as a method for eliciting the activity which is occurring in a translator's mind. In this study think aloud protocols {{have been used}} not only as a data collecting method but also as a technique for training translators which may be effectual in increasing student’s uncertainty management and solving problems. Uncertainty is an estate of indecision in the process of translation, and it is closely related to solving problem and uncertainty management during the translation activity. There are seventy-five upper intermediate ESL learners, who were taught translation in a fifty-five hour-translation process workshop, were using think-aloud protocols for translating texts. The study argues students who were using think-aloud protocols to verbalize the text may present better uncertainty management in their next translation activities. The result of study may show think-aloud protocols can be used in classrooms as a technique for teaching translation. In this study, four methodologies have been used; screen recording, <b>sight</b> <b>translation,</b> think-aloud protocols and interview...|$|E
