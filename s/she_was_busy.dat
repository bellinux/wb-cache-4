O'Hara beat Lauren Bacall to the role as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>busy</b> with other engagements. Though the film was critically acclaimed, Crowther of The New York Times felt that the characters of O'Hara and the daughter {{could have been made}} [...] "more humorous and spirited than they are". The following year, O'Hara appeared in the CBS television film, Mrs. Miniver, but despite some critics approving her performance, most thought that the remake was ill-timed and that she could not top Greer Garson's performance in the 1942 Oscar-winning film.|$|E

It is the theme for the film A League of Their Own, which starred Madonna, and portrayed a fictionalized account of the real-life All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Madonna was asked to record a song for the film's soundtrack. At that time <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>busy</b> recording her fifth studio album, Erotica, [...] with producer Shep Pettibone. They worked on some ideas {{and came up with}} [...] "This Used to Be My Playground" [...] in two days. Once presented to director Penny Marshall's team, the song was released as a standalone single on June 16, 1992, by Warner Bros. Records. However, it was not available on the film's soundtrack due to contractual obligations and was later added to the Olympics-inspired Barcelona Gold compilation album, released that summer. The song was included on Madonna's 1995 ballads compilation Something to Remember.|$|E
500|$|The Boston Globes Sarah Rodman {{wrote that}} the song is moody but far too {{deliberate}} and [...] "has a grab bag of evocative images but never quite jells".

Andy Jill of The Independent stated that [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] and [...] "Fire Bomb" [...] have [...] "inflammatory" [...] titles. Entertainment Weekly's Simon Vozick-Levinson wrote that although Rihanna took risk with releasing the song, it pays off, [...] "Rihanna is in fine vocal form throughout, and Ne-Yo's songwriting is economical and evocative per usual." [...] A staff from MTV Newsroom thought that the single retains some sort of attitude and atmosphere that made Rihanna [...] "such a definitive artist".

She said [...] that it [...] " [...] is very dear" [...] to her heart. Footage of the performance appeared on the Internet soon after, and positive response encouraged Lady Gaga to perform the song during the first concert of the North American leg of The Monster Ball Tour in Montreal.

However, since <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>busy</b> shooting for her film, Who's That Girl then titled Slammer, she chose to write and compose one song. Madonna had originally written and recorded the song for her third studio album, True Blue (1986), but it did not make the final track list. [...] "Each Time You Break My Heart" [...] also contains background vocals by the singer. The Latin Rascals handled the editing of the track, which was engineered by Steve Peck.

2500|$|British {{director}} Danny Tull {{was signed}} {{for creating the}} tour backdrops. Tull, who had collaborated with Madonna since her 2006 Confessions Tour, explained that the singer was a [...] "detail-oriented person" [...] and every scene in the backdrops had a creative meaning behind it. The first video showed themes of confinement, love, sex, violence among others, while that changed in the backdrop for [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna", where Tull wanted to create more abstract imagery and superfluous color and dancing elements. Similarly for [...] "Devil Pray" [...] showed scenes of drug intake and snakes, churches and crosses which were interspersed with scenes of baptism and religious proceedings. In order to create all the visuals, Tull and his team {{had a number of}} discussions with Madonna, mainly in the nighttime since <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>busy</b> with rehearsals throughout the day. They aligned on what would be the source of the images, any permission if required, using stock footage or create new graphics. The idea for using fan artwork during the [...] "Rebel Heart" [...] song grew from this, and ultimately the fan contest was announced. Many layering and rendering was done for most of the videos. Different multimedia software were used to create the visuals, like Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Avid, as well as Final Cut Pro as the main tools. For Tull, the challenge was to adapt to each different software based on the different videos they would create, including last minute changes and tweaks.|$|E
2500|$|Bobby Fryer, who had {{produced}} the Jean Brodie film, had collaborated with Katharine Hepburn {{to make the}} film version of Graham Greene's Travels with My Aunt (1972), specifically for George Cukor to direct. Cukor for some reason wasn't getting any work and Hepburn was casting around for projects. They asked Allen to come on board for the script, but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>busy</b> and instead suggested Hugh Wheeler. After a few months, Fryer and Hepburn still weren't happy with Wheeler's script, so Allen agreed to work on the project and wrote a very straightforward script for them. But Hepburn had just starred in the disastrous adaptation of Madwoman of Chaillot and didn't want, in Allen's words, [...] "to play another crazy old lady." [...] Hepburn was reluctant to let Cukor down and wouldn't admit her reservations and began to find fault with the script, even rewriting many sections herself. Consequently, Allen finally gave up the endeavor, telling Hepburn that she ought to write it herself, which the actress did. Eventually, Hepburn provoked the studio into making her quit the project, leaving Fryer free to bring Jean Brodies Maggie Smith on board to make the picture. One speech of Allen's remains in the script, otherwise it is all Hepburn's product. The Writer's Guild refused to put Hepburn's name on the script since she wasn't a guild member; Fryer refused to let Allen take her name off since she was the one he paid, and Wheeler was just burned that he received no credit at all.|$|E
