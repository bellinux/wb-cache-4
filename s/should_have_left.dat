5|$|Billy and Frank stopped {{first at}} the Grand Hotel on Allen Street, and were greeted by Doc Holliday. They learned {{immediately}} after of their brothers' beatings by the Earps within the previous two hours. The incidents had generated {{a lot of talk}} in town. Angrily, Frank said he would not drink, and he and Billy left the saloon immediately to seek Tom. By law, both Frank and Billy <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> their firearms at the Grand Hotel. Instead, they remained fully armed.|$|E
5|$|For his {{portrayal}} of Lionel Luthor on Smallville, John Glover was nominated for two Saturn Awards {{in the category of}} Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series. The first came in 2003, following his upgrade to series regular status, and the second in 2004. By season four, one reviewer said Lionel <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> the show after succumbing to his terminal liver disease in season three. Maurice Cobbs of DVD Verdict said Lionel was taking away from the primary characters' screen time in season four, and the producers should have killed him at the end of season three.|$|E
25|$|The Court ruled 7-1 in the government's favor, affirming much of {{the consent}} decree (Justice Robert H. Jackson took no part in the proceedings). William O. Douglas {{delivered}} the Court's opinion, with Felix Frankfurter dissenting in part, arguing the Court <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> all of the decree intact but its arbitration provisions.|$|E

25|$|When Diotallevi is {{diagnosed}} with cancer, he attributes this to {{his participation in}} The Plan. He feels that the disease is a divine punishment for involving himself in mysteries he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> alone and creating a game that mocked something larger than them all. Belbo meanwhile retreats even farther into the Plan to avoid confronting problems in his personal life.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{difficulty}} with {{this model is}} that no martian climate simulation can reliably simulate a warm, wet Noachian, {{largely due to the}} distance between the sun and Mars compared to the Earth, and the inferred weaker Sun in the early solar system. Furthermore, a CO2-H2O greenhouse atmosphere to warm the climate <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> extensive deposits of carbonate rocks, which have not been found. Problems also exist with sustaining such an atmosphere for long enough to allow the valleys to form, as the unweathered basalts so prevalent on Mars should form extremely effective carbon sinks, especially if the surface is wet, and continuing impacts from space in Mars' early history should quickly strip any atmosphere away.|$|E
25|$|In March 1985, {{after his}} arrest but before his trial, DuMond claimed he was {{attacked}} in his home by two men and castrated. No arrests {{were made in the}} incident. Phil Ostermann, the Arkansas State Police investigator who handled the castration case, noted in his report that Dr. Jeff Whitfield of the Elvis Presley Trauma Center in Memphis examined DuMond after the incident, and was asked by DuMond's wife whether it was possible the castration was self-inflicted. Whitfield responded that it was possible, and he had noted similar cases of self-mutilation in the past. Fletcher Long, the attorney who prosecuted DuMond for the rape of Ashley Stevens, was skeptical that DuMond could have castrated himself, but he also doubted DuMond's account because {{there was no evidence of}} a struggle, or that he had been tied up (which <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> ligature marks), and there was a two-thirds-empty half-gallon bottle of Jim Beam whiskey at the scene of the supposed assault.|$|E

25|$|Annie {{said she}} <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> {{the house after}} her daughter, Sophie, was born (in 2004, Sophie Anquetil {{published}} the book Pour l'amour de Jacques in which she confirmed what had been rumoured but what Anquetil had always tried to hide: that she was Anquetil's daughter). Instead, she grew jealous of her own mother and demanded that she leave instead. When Janine refused, Annie left instead. To fill {{the gap in the}} house, Janine invited her son, Alain, and his wife, Dominique, to return to live there. Anquetil began an affair with Dominique, to make Annie jealous. Dominique had Anquetil's child but Annie still refused to return. Dominique still lives in the house, Les Elfes, where she organises conferences. Janine and Anquetil divorced. Sophie moved in with Janine, although she lives now in Calenzana, near Calvi. Both Janine and Dominique wrote their life story: neither mentioned the link between Sophie and Anquetil.|$|E
25|$|On 12 June 1974, {{he played}} against Hampshire at Taunton in a Benson & Hedges Cup (B Cup) quarter-final. Hampshire won the toss {{and decided to}} bat. They scored 182 all out with Botham taking two for 33 {{including}} the prize wicket of Barry Richards, bowled for 13. Botham was number nine in Somerset's batting order and came in with his team struggling at 113 for 7. Almost immediately, that became 113 for 8 and he had only the tailenders Hallam Moseley and Bob Clapp to support him. He was facing the West Indian fast bowler Andy Roberts who delivered a bouncer which {{hit him in the}} mouth. Despite heavy bleeding and the eventual loss of four teeth, Botham refused to leave the field and carried on batting. He hit two sixes and made 45*, enabling Somerset to win by one wicket. He won the Gold Award. Later, he said he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> the field but was full of praise for Moseley and Clapp.|$|E
500|$|Philip Lawrence notes [...] "we {{all have}} a little bit of OCD" [...] and Mars {{acknowledges}} he sometimes has trouble letting his songs go. Mars is an obsessively detail-oriented musician.

500|$|Newspapers and {{television}} stations interviewed people along the route about their opinions on {{the changing of the}} highway's number. Even some people who believed in the 666 curse disagreed with the change. One went on record as stating highway officials, [...] "are messing with the wrong guy. They're making the devil mad. They <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> the 666 alone." [...] Others were more sarcastic. One Monticello resident stated, [...] "We'll really miss all the potheads stopping and taking pictures of the Route666 sign." [...] Most residents took pride in living along the Devil's Highway and opposed the change. Some commented that no matter the number they would still call the road the Devil's Highway.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, the episode {{has been criticized}} by several outlets. The staff {{received}} several complaints from the NRA about the portrayal of the organization in the episode, {{despite the fact that}} the Springfield NRA revokes Homer's membership for his irresponsible behavior. Ian Jones and Steve Williams criticized the episode, calling it [...] "a messy, unfocused lampooning of gun culture". Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, found that it was [...] "one of the most politically unambiguous episodes ever", but that [...] " [...] is very dull and the plot isn't sustainable". Anna Leszkiewicz in the New Statesman later pinpointed it as the moment Marge <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> Homer, saying [...] "Homer has proved himself to be a violent, unstable, controlling, reckless husband".|$|E
500|$|Writing for {{entertainment}} news website Digital Spy, Daniel Kilkelly said Peggy's final episode featured [...] "plenty of poignant moments —not least the scene which saw Peggy {{standing in the}} destroyed Queen Vic and appearing completely devastated." [...] Gareth McLean from The Guardian said the use of [...] "Peggy's Theme" [...] was a [...] "suitably sentimental sendoff" [...] for the character, but said that [...] "in hindsight, Peggy <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> Walford {{three or four years}} ago, her character trapped in a cycle of increasingly samey stories that reduced her to a parody of her former self", describing her efforts to put out the flames as [...] "like a very sooty clockwork mouse". James McCarthy of Welsh newspaper Western Mail said Windsor's [...] "final emotional scene will doubtless remain the stuff of EastEnders legend for years to come," [...] and Jim Shelley from the Daily Mirror said [...] "It was a good way to go." [...] However, Shelley's colleague Polly Hudson said Peggy's exit was a [...] "non event", as [...] "Peggy just left, nonsensically and at complete odds with everything we've learnt about her character over the last 15 years." ...|$|E

[...] Some <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>left,</b> but the German port authorities used various excuses to delay their departure.

2500|$|The Attacker {{suffered}} from deficiencies {{which led to}} it quickly being superseded; one being that the aircraft retained the Spiteful's tail-wheel undercarriage (due {{to the extent of}} the re-tooling that would have been required to alter the Spiteful's wing), rather than a nose-wheel undercarriage, thus making the Attacker more difficult to land on aircraft carriers. This same tail-down attitude meant that when operating from grass airfields the jet exhaust would create a long furrow in the ground that [...] "three men could lie down in". Also the new wing was apparently aerodynamically inferior to the original Spitfire elliptic one, with lower critical Mach number, leading to someone quipping that [...] "they rather <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> the Spitfire wing on the thing".|$|E

Most of her comments center on humanity's lack of knowledge. She states that humanity is [...] "innocent and ignorant;" [...] that people were not built to be wise, having been given only five of the six senses: sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing, but lacking knowledge.
