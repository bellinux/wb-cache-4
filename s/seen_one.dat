5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the period}} Scotland had adopted many of the major tenets of the European Renaissance in art, {{architecture}} and literature and produced a developed educational system. This period has been <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> in which a clear national identity emerged in Scotland, as well as significant distinctions between different regions of the country which would be particularly significant in the period of the Reformation.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the steep}} slope {{on which the}} {{building}} is situated, {{it had to be}} specially designed out of concrete to fit into its foundations correctly. From the front, the building appears to have only three floors. However, from the rear, all of its six floors can be <b>seen.</b> <b>One</b> part of the building's foundation was made of concrete piles, and the other as a continuous foundation. Usually, these two approaches do not mix well but Horodecki somehow succeeded in overcoming this technical problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{recognition of}} the Armenian Genocide by the US federal government is <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> of the most vital steps in international and full {{recognition of the}} 1915–1923 events. Many Armenians think that the US {{has the ability to}} force Turkey to recognize the past and pay Armenians and Armenia their reparations, that includes (for some) the return of the so-called Wilsonian Armenia to the Republic of Armenia.|$|E

5|$|Fleming {{borrowed}} from his surroundings, {{as he had}} done with all his writing up to that point, to include places he had <b>seen.</b> <b>One</b> such location was a motel in the Adirondacks in upstate New York, which Fleming would drive past on the way to Ivar Bryce's Black Hollow Farm; this became the Dreamy Pines Motel. Similarly, he took incidents from his own life and used them in the novel: Vivienne Michel's seduction in a box in the Royalty Kinema, Windsor, mirrors Fleming's loss of virginity in the same establishment. A colleague at The Sunday Times, Robert Harling, gave his name to a printer in the story while another minor character, Frank Donaldson, was named after Jack Donaldson, a friend of Fleming's wife. One of Fleming's neighbours in Jamaica was Vivienne Stuart, whose first name Fleming purloined for the novel's heroine.|$|E

Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) dresses up as Sarah Kerrigan from StarCraft, but Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) takes off his wings as they had knives on them and Dwight {{is not allowed to}} bring in weapons. Bert recognizes what his costume is {{supposed}} to be and the two bond over playing StarCraft all day, ignoring everyone else. Dwight also makes Bert pretend to fire Toby, for taking away his weapons, on the grounds that he is the CEO's son.|$|E

When the show ended at 22:45, Bueno {{went to the}} restaurant El Corralón in Buenos Aires' Palermo neighborhood, where he dined with his family, Fernando Olmedo (son of the comedian Alberto Olmedo) and comedian Pepe Parada. Olmedo remarked {{that he had never}} <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> of Bueno's shows, and Bueno invited him to a show that same night at the club Escándalo in La Plata. Bueno gave a two-and-a-half hour performance {{in front of an audience}} of 2,000. When the concert was over, he was asked to stay at the club to rest, but Bueno refused, expressing his desire to drive.|$|E

5|$|The medieval city walls, {{built in}} several stages between the 13th and the 16th century, were torn down after the French {{annexation}} in the 17th century. However, four towers escaped destruction. The Tour des Sorcières ("witches' tower"), which served as a gate and a jail, is the tallest. The Tour de l'Horloge ("clock tower") was also originally part of a gate. The clock and the elaborate roof were added in 1614. Two much smaller towers can also be <b>seen,</b> <b>one</b> near the Ill river and another integrated into a later house. All these remains date from the 13th century.|$|E

Tracks, droppings, and other signs of forest elephants and gorillas were commonly seen, as well as crocodiles in the lake. Despite {{the fact that the}} African guides were extremely capable and experienced hunters, guides and experts of the African rainforest, they were not able to show any track or sign of the Mokèlé-mbèmbé and none of the several interviewed guides even claimed ever to have <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> personally, nor its tracks. Remarkable {{is the fact that the}} guides that were interviewed by the Dutch expedition and that also accompanied Regusters, stated that they never saw a Mokèlé-mbèmbé during that expedition, although Regusters himself claims to have <b>seen</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{play was}} {{originally}} produced at the Schauspielhaus Zürich, produced by Leopold Lindtberg in 1941. Most {{of the score}} consisted of original compositions by the Swiss composer Paul Burkhard; the rest had been arranged by him. The musicians were placed {{in view of the}} audience so that they could be <b>seen,</b> <b>one</b> of Brecht's many techniques in Epic Theatre.

25|$|By taking limits, certain {{rational}} {{products with}} infinitely many factors can be evaluated {{in terms of}} the gamma function as well. Due to the Weierstrass factorization theorem, analytic functions can be written as infinite products, and these can sometimes be represented as finite products or quotients of the gamma function. We have already <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> striking example: the reflection formula essentially represents the sine function as the product of two gamma functions. Starting from this formula, the exponential function as well as all the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions can be expressed {{in terms of the}} gamma function.|$|E

Porter (Jeff Bennett) - Father of Jane, Professor Porter is a noted {{scientist}} {{with years of}} expertise studying gorillas, though prior to arriving in Africa in the first film, he's never <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> in the wild. Sometimes the kindhearted professor gets so absorbed in his thinking that he simply forgets what he's doing. Even so, Jane doesn't bat an eye at her father's eccentric antics—she's used to them and shares his enthusiasm. When they both finally meet the gorillas, it's the fulfillment of a lifelong dream, even if the professor does faint at the sight.|$|E
25|$|On 9 April, {{human rights}} activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja and his two sons-in-law were arrested. His {{daughter}} Zainab who subsequently underwent a hunger strike to protest the arrests, said al-Khawaja was bleeding after getting beaten unconscious during the arrest. That month alone, four protesters had died due to torture in government custody including journalists Karim Fakhrawi and Zakariya Rashid Hassan al-Ashiri. The government initially denied such reports and accused {{human rights activist}} Nabeel Rajab of fabricating photos, however a HRW researcher and a BBC reporter who had <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> body prior to burial stated they were accurate. Five prison guards were subsequently charged with a protesters death.|$|E

In 2011, Rolling Stone writer David Fricke placed Greg Ginn of Black Flag 99th place in his 100 Greatest Guitarists list. Although the music genre started in English-speaking western countries, notable hardcore scenes have existed in Italy, Brazil, Japan, Europe and the Middle East.|$|E
