5|$|About fifty {{grades of}} {{titanium}} and titanium alloys are designed and currently used, although {{only a couple}} of dozen are readily available commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure (unalloyed). Those four vary in tensile <b>strength</b> as a function of oxygen content, with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile <b>strength</b> with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least ductile (highest tensile <b>strength</b> with an oxygen content of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, <b>strength,</b> hardness, electrical resistivity, creep resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.|$|E
5|$|Ductility is an {{important}} factor in ensuring the integrity of structures by enabling them to sustain local stress concentrations without fracture. In addition, structures are required to be of an acceptable <b>strength,</b> which is related to a material's yield <b>strength.</b> In general, as the yield <b>strength</b> of a material increases, there is a corresponding reduction in fracture toughness.|$|E

Existing research {{attests to the}} protective effects of key <b>strengths,</b> such as self-esteem, family connectedness, and positive peer relationships among children and adolescents (Van Voorhees et al., 2008). Despite the growing interest {{in the role of}} <b>strengths</b> during childhood and adolescence, few studies have examined <b>strengths</b> from developmental and multidimensional perspectives. In the current study, a developmental framework was applied to study the effect of groupings, or profiles, of personal <b>strengths</b> on both academic and social emotional outcomes among a sample of children and adolescents (N = 414; Mage = 12. 58). Three distinct profiles of personal <b>strengths</b> were identified: a High <b>Strengths,</b> Moderate <b>Strengths,</b> and Low <b>Strengths</b> profile. Each profile was associated with a unique set of personal <b>strengths.</b> Age and gender differences were detected, indicating that older children were more likely to belong to the Moderate <b>Strengths</b> profile than younger children, and boys had a greater likelihood of belonging to the Low <b>Strengths</b> group than girls. Better mental health and academic outcomes were associated with a greater probability of belonging to the High <b>Strengths</b> profile, and a lower probability of belonging to the Low <b>Strengths</b> and profile. Lower academic engagement was associated with a greater likelihood of belonging to the Moderate <b>Strengths</b> profile. Findings from the current study contribute to the growing literature on <b>strengths</b> and positive youth development and are relevant to researchers, clinicians, educators, and policy-makers.

5|$|Interestingly, {{although}} the centrum of Hatzegopteryx {{is much more}} robust than Arambourgiania, their ratios of bone radius to bone thickness (R/t) are roughly the same (9.45 for Hatzegopteryx and 9.9 for Arambourgiania). This may represent a compromise between increasing bending <b>strength</b> and buckling strength; higher R/t ratios lead to improved bending <b>strength,</b> but weaker buckling <b>strength.</b> To compensate for this, Hatzegopteryx shows {{a number of other}} adaptations to improve buckling <b>strength,</b> namely the distinctive internal structures of the bones and the large articular joints of the vertebrae, the latter of which helps to distribute stress.|$|E

The workshop enhances the participant experience of <b>strengths</b> discovery using active constructive responding, savouring and process praise.

40|$|The {{present study}} among 65 civil {{engineers}} investigates {{the impact of}} organizational support for <b>strengths</b> use on weekly work engagement and proactive behaviour. Positive psychology postulates that <b>strengths</b> use makes people feel authentic and efficacious. We argue that employees use these positive psychological states as resources that fuel work engagement and proactive work behaviour. Participants completed a general questionnaire regarding <b>strengths</b> use support, and a weekly quantitative diary questionnaire regarding their <b>strengths</b> use, self-efficacy, work engagement, and proactive behaviour {{over a period of}} five consecutive workweeks. In line with the hypotheses, the results of multilevel structural equation analyses showed that organizational <b>strengths</b> use support was positively related to weekly <b>strengths</b> use. Furthermore, the results indicated that weekly <b>strengths</b> use was positively related to weekly work engagement and proactive behaviour, through weekly self-efficacy (sequential mediation). Although <b>strengths</b> use support contributed indirectly to work engagement (mediated by <b>strengths</b> use and self-efficacy), there was no significant indirect relationship with proactive behaviour. Our study indicates that <b>strengths</b> use is associated with employees’ levels of self-efficacy, work engagement, and proactive behaviour and that organizations can help employees to use their <b>strengths</b> more often by giving them the opportunity to do what they are good at.

40|$|<b>Strengths</b> {{assessments}} {{focus on}} the individual 2 ̆ 7 s talents, abilities, resources, and <b>strengths.</b> No systematic review of <b>strengths</b> assessments for use within mental health populations has been published. The aims {{of this study were}} to describe and evaluate <b>strengths</b> assessments for use within mental health services. A systematic review identified 12 <b>strengths</b> assessments (5 quantitative, 7 qualitative). The <b>Strengths</b> Assessment Worksheet (SAW) was the most widely utilized and evaluated qualitative assessment. Psychometric properties of the assessments were assessed against set quality criteria. Data on psychometric properties were available for 4 measures.

The SAW and CASIG assessments can be tentatively recommended within clinical practice, although the evidence for all <b>strengths</b> assessments is currently limited. To describe the content of the <b>strengths</b> assessment, the items used to operationalize the concept of <b>strengths</b> in each assessment were extracted and themed.
