500|$|The {{so-called}} [...] "cyber-kidnapping" [...] {{portrayed in}} [...] "Weeping Willow" [...] {{is believed to}} be the first such crime ever portrayed on television. While the writers and producers prepared the episode, several district attorneys they consulted said the law was dangerously vague regarding what charges could be filed in the event of such a real-life cyber-kidnapping; Wright said, [...] "They told me that this is a real problem, that there's a lag between what's on the books now and what's happening out there." [...] The script also includes a difficulty on the part of the detectives in coping and dealing this new form of cyber-crime and differentiating the truth from the hoax; Leight said, [...] "Their biggest frustration is trying to understand what's real and what isn't. Does this woman, Willow, really exist, and has something happened to her? Is <b>she</b> <b>playing</b> a character and a game that's gotten out of hand? And how do you locate someone in cyberspace?" ...|$|E

[...] "Yes, {{it is her}} touch, dear heart, I recognize it. They are singing. Why--it is a hymn! and the sacredest of all, the most touching, the most consoling.... It seems to open the gates of paradise to me.... If I could die now...." ...|$|E

6000|$|There was {{a ring of}} new-found {{decision}} in her tone that quite dashed him. He sat dumbly facing her, helpless in a whirl of mental storm. [...] "Is she more cunning than I thought? Is <b>she</b> <b>playing</b> a more complex game than appears?" [...] These thoughts vaguely shaped themselves. Then his filial self answered: [...] "But what has she to gain? She loves me. She has sacrificed herself to keep me at school--why should she deceive me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{very bad}} manners to take {{advantage}} of cabs." [...] And, withdrawing sullenly into his corner, he watched her askance. Was <b>she</b> <b>playing</b> with him? Or had she really ceased to care the snap of a finger? It seemed incredible. The cab, which had been threading the maze of the Soho streets, stopped.

6000|$|He {{left his}} hansom on the Embankment, {{and walked up}} to the Old Church, {{uncertain}} of the block of flats where he knew she lived. He found it hiding behind a much larger mansion; and having read the name, 'Mrs. Irene Heron'--Heron, forsooth! Her maiden name: so she used that again, did she?--he stepped back into the road to look up at the windows of the first floor. Light was coming through in the corner flat, and he could hear a piano being played. He had never had a love of music, had secretly borne it a grudge in the old days when so often she had turned to her piano, making of it a refuge place into which she knew he could not enter. Repulse! The long repulse, at first restrained and secret, at last open! Bitter memory came with that sound. It must be <b>she</b> <b>playing,</b> and thus almost assured of seeing her, he stood more undecided than ever. Shivers of anticipation ran through him; his tongue felt dry, his heart beat fast. 'I have no cause to be afraid,' he thought. And then the lawyer stirred within him. Was he doing a foolish thing? Ought he not to have arranged a formal meeting in the presence of her trustee? No! Not before that fellow Jolyon, who sympathised with her! Never! He crossed back into the doorway, and, slowly, to keep down the beating of his heart, mounted the single flight of stairs and rang the bell. When the door was opened to him his sensations were regulated by the scent which came--that perfume--from away back in the past, bringing muffled remembrance: fragrance of a drawing-room he used to enter, of a house he used to own--perfume of dried rose-leaves and honey! ...|$|E

50|$|B.A.'s cousin Sara, {{the only}} female member of the group, prefers games {{with a focus on}} role playing rather than the pure action.

Usually the voice of reason, Sara has reflexes that would scare a striking cobra and has been known to have a hair-trigger temper on certain subjects (sexist remarks being perhaps the foremost); Bob, Dave and Brian have all had their shirt collars wrenched by a fuming Sara at least once.|$|E
