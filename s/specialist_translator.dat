40|$|Current {{investments}} in lexicographic projects, mostly from large companies, lead to foresee {{a certain degree}} of continuity in the Gran Diccionario Bilingüe (Bilingual Dictionary) genre. Such dictionaries are intended for a wide public of students, <b>specialists,</b> <b>translators</b> and interpreters. These works are extremely complex and diversified in their aims, which are not always satisfied, and still show points of weakness in their conception due to fundamental issues such as the characteristics of the corpus used, grammar and discourse foundations, the criteria for the selection of entries and orientations on collocations and phraseology. The issues dealt with in this study are the aims and contents of the Bilingual Dictionary (indications on grammar, cultural words, diatopic variation). The main {{purpose of this study is}} that of presenting the current status of this field of lexicography in the Spanish/Italian language pair, which is undoubtedly growing, with works published in Italy and therefore belonging to the Italian lexicographic tradition, although in one case they are directed or authored by Spanish lexicographers...|$|R
40|$|It is {{a common}} {{assumption}} that technical terms and their meanings can be more easily matched across special languages than in general language. While {{there may be some}} truth in this assumption for a subset of terms, the overall picture is a more complex one, in which phraseology, the linguistic neighbourhood of terms, and semantic variation, the perspectivisation of meaning, {{play a role in the}} decisions taken by the <b>specialist</b> <b>translator.</b> In this paper, I would like to discuss some examples of how technical terms behave in text as opposed to dictionaries, and to relate this to selected aspects of the literature on translation, terminology and linguistics. We will also look at the resources available to specialist translators in the form of dictionaries or ‘terminologies’, and texts, relating these to the problems which such translators may face in their work. Let us start with the system-use dichotomy represented by the relationship between dictionaries (system) and texts (language use) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTwo {{of basic}} {{dimensions}} of lecturers {{in higher education}} institutions, who are identified as academicians, are functions of producing knowledge through scientific research and providing students with efficient theoretical and practical education service. Training of academicians as researchers and educators who constitute such manpower in higher education institutions are shaped by current high education policies in a country. Therefore, education programmes implemented to train academicians have {{a significant role in}} determining the qualifications of higher education. According to Higher Education Personnel Code number 2914, academic teaching is conducted by three groups known as lecturers, instructors and prelectors with assistants. Academicians who serve under professor, associate professor and assistant professor cadres comprise the faculty members group. Lecturers and instructors are academicians who give lectures in their own fields and implement guidelines. In the group of teaching assistants; research assistants, <b>specialists,</b> <b>translators</b> and education-teaching planners take place. In this paper, current situation of faculty members in our country and their training within the currently implemented higher education policy is being addressed...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the scope and}} intricacies of technical translation in Oman, in general, and its Royal Air Force (RAFO), in particular. The Study, {{which is the first}} of its kind in Oman, focuses on a specific category of Omani translators: technical translators currently working in RAFO with experience ranging from 3 to 10 years. To capture the reality of translation in Oman and to provide a corpus for this study, samples of translations rendered by the subject translators are examined and analysed. To achieve such objectives, six chapters make up the thesis: Chapter 1 sets both the motivations and the assumptions which underly the thesis. Chapter 2 selectively reviews some translation approaches within the sphere of translation studies. Chapter 3 is devoted to the study of technical translation and explores the scope of this type of translation. Chapter 4 {{examines the}} development of translation in the Arab world and focuses on the way it spread in the past and its current situation. Chapter 5 specifically takes the translation movement in RAFO as the case study. The chapter starts with a description of translation in Oman and RAFO and then moves to data collection, processing and analysis. Technical texts have been categorized, to our knowledge for the first time in the literature of technical translation, to three main groups according to the degree of their technicality: 1) Local Technical Texts (LTT), 2) Common Technical Texts (CTT), and 3) Highly Technical Texts (HTT). Chapter 6 concludes the thesis and provides some recommendations as well as suggestions for further research. The results of data analysis indicate that although technical translation plays a vital role in the development of the nation, there is still a lack of an overall strategy towards the organization of this profession at various levels. RAFO has endeavoured to introduce a programme that would produce qualified translators capable of dealing with texts of different degrees of technicality. Data analysis shows that the translators face little problems in handling texts from a linguistic point of view. However, the source of their problems is technical terminology for which there are neither <b>specialists</b> <b>translators</b> nor adequate Arabic dictionaries available. The fact that Oman still lacks a body and special dictionaries devoted to technico-scientific terms places obstacles for translating. It further hinders the standardization of terminology and causes confusion for translators as to which terms they may choose. It follows, therefore, that these and other results can be interpreted as reflecting support for the establishment of a body that would supervise and organize all translation activities in Oman such as a language academy. There is also a need for a nation-wide policy towards arabicisation, translation and dissemination of scientific and technical terms. A pan-Arab policy remains an ultimate goal...|$|R
40|$|Drawing on the {{framework}} of systemic-functional linguistics, this paper examines cognitive effort for meaning explicitation in translation tasks. Two hypotheses were formulated building on Steiner (2001 a,b) and Tirkkonen-Condit (2005) : (1) literal translation, as a default translation procedure/strategy, minimises cognitive effort; and (2) explicitation of more implicit realisations in the source text requires more cognitive effort. To test these hypotheses, 16 Brazilians and 16 Germans, proportionally distributed as field <b>specialists</b> and professional <b>translators,</b> were asked to perform a translation task of one of two versions of an L 2 (English) source text into their L 1. Both source text versions construed analogous meanings, but they had either the most explicit or the most implicit variants of ten agnate realisation pairs (five of each in each version). The task was recorded using the key-logging program Translog 2006. From a process-oriented perspective, the key-logged data were analysed to determine the renditions per variant, number of micro-units per word, number of pauses per word, and drafting time per word. From a product-oriented perspective, subjects' renditions were analysed to investigate {{the impact of their}} choices on the explicitness and implicitness of the target texts. Overall, the results confirm the hypothesis that literal translation is a default procedure that requires less cognitive effort. As to the second hypothesis, more implicit variants in the source text do not necessarily require more cognitive effort than their less implicit variants...|$|R
40|$|Bad Sobernheim Stress Questionnaire-Brace and Bad Sobernheim Stress Questionnaire-Deformity are {{relatively}} new tools aimed at facilitating {{the evaluation of}} long-term results of therapy in persons with idiopathic scoliosis undergoing conservative treatment. To use these tools properly in Poland, they must be translated into Polish and adapted to the Polish cultural settings. The process of cultural adaptation of the questionnaires was compliant with the guidelines of International Quality of Life Assessment (IQOLA) Project. In the first stage, two independent translators converted the originals into Polish. Stage two, consisted of {{a comparison of the}} originals and two translated versions. During that stage, the team of two translators and authors of the project identified differences in those translations and created a combination of the two. In the third stage, two independent translators, who were native speakers of German, translated the adjusted version of the Polish translation into the language of the original document. At the last stage, a commission composed of: <b>specialists</b> in orthopedics, <b>translators,</b> a statistician and a psychologist reviewed all translations and drafted a pre-final version of the questionnaires. Thirty-five adolescent girls with idiopathic scoliosis who were treated with Cheneau brace were subjected to the questionnaire assessment. All patients were treated in an out-patient setting by a specialist in orthopedics at the Chair and Clinic of Orthopedics and Traumatology. Median age of patients was 14. 8 SD 1. 5, median value of the Cobb’s angle was 27. 8 ° SD 7. 4. 48. 6 % of patients had thoracic scoliosis, 31. 4 % had thoracolumbar scoliosis, and 20 % patients had lumbar scoliosis. Median results obtained by means of the Polish version of BSSQ-Brace and BSSQ-Deformity questionnaires were 17. 9 SD 5. 0 and 11. 3 SD 4. 7, respectively. Internal consistency of BSSQ-Brace and BSSQ-Deformity was at the level of 0. 80 and 0. 87, whereas the value of the absolute stability factor was 0. 82 and 0. 88. Overall, the Polish versions of the BSSQ-Brace and BSSQ-Deformity Questionnaires are characterized by high values of internal consistency factor and absolute stability factor. Following the process of adaptation, the authors obtained a tool that is instrumental in clinical evaluations and complies with methodological criteria...|$|R
40|$|This Design and Demonstration type of Master’s Thesis {{consists}} of two parts: it describes the practical terminology project in which I participated in my previous place of employment and it outlines {{the basic principles of}} the theory of terminology. The General Theory of Terminology was first developed to help in the practical work of categorizing and classifying concepts and this basic characteristic has prevailed. This is also visible in this Master’s Thesis: the need for collecting and organising terms in a systematic manner was the starting point of the practical terminology project. The terminology in the field of telecommunications and in the field of mobile technology started to increase as the new technology was being developed and the new products introduced. To accompany the launched products information about them was available in English and localised in several languages. The new terminology needed to be collected, harmonised, and stored for reuse in the information production, technical documentation and localisation. At the time of the project, the company employed several language specialists who were interested in terminology. Many co-operating teams and people were contacted and extensive amount of source-material and preterms were studied when the scope of the terminology corpus was planned and terms were harvested. The most active phase of the terminology project lasted for approximately 2. 5 years. It was part-time work, done in addition to technical writing and localisation projects. Nevertheless, it resulted in a mobile technology terminology corpus of 200 terms and their equivalents in 24 languages collected and stored in the termbank. In addition, the entire terminology process was established and fine-tuned and the process for continuing systematic terminology work in the company was set up. Terminology work continued as a part of technical documentation and localisation work when the first part-time terminologists moved on to other projects and duties in the company. This Master’s Thesis on terminology serves not only as the introduction to the theory of terminology but also as an introduction of terminology of the particular field. It comprises a case study of practical terminology work, which is the essence of this particular master’s thesis. It also describes some of the tasks in technical documentation and terminology, at the time quite strongly growing specialist areas, on which language <b>specialists</b> such as <b>translators</b> had plenty of career opportunities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{research}} task of this Master’s Thesis is {{to define}} and analyze potential markets related of projector-sensor technology in hospitality industry and to define service concepts and business ecosystems related to projector-sensor technology. From an academic point of view this study aims to participate in discussion around the concepts of customer value and business ecosystem. This is done by analyzing market potential of a value proposition through business biosphere -framework. The key element of business biosphere -framework is a business ecosystem developed around a customer value in dynamic business environment. It is influenced by economic, technological and social changes of business environment. From managerial point of view {{the aim is to}} demonstrate an example of market potential analysis of value propositions under development. Expected results of the study are to spot growing needs in the hospitality industry and to assess value propositions related to the technology for their market potential. From this setting it is expected to point possibilities for business opportunities and suggestions for the further development of the dynamic lighting technology from demand point-of-view. The study was conducted as an exploratory research with inductive orientation, demonstrating qualitative research methods capturing market intuition. The methods used for the market potential analysis were visionary industry expert interviews, trends and future scenarios. The analysis of the data was done through categorizing the data first to benefits noted based on needs of the industry and concerns related to challenges of projector-sensor technology, followed by theming the data under three themes: economic view, social view and technological view. Finally, the data was compared to an industry review. According to the results of the empiric research, the most appreciated benefits of projector-sensor technology in hospitality environment are: enhancing customer experience by creating atmospheres, automating certain parts of service process through internal information transfer and enabling flexible service through easy update and control of customer information. The concerns related to challenges could be grouped under keywords of: lack of personal touch during service, customer experience issues such as ease of use and relevant content, connectivity to other systems, and functionality issues such as total price in use including installation and maintenance. The results of the study reveal that several participant companies need to be involved in creating value propositions actually valuable for the industry. Such are: user experience expert, strategic marketing expert, graphic designer, software provider, hardware provider, installation <b>specialist,</b> entertainment provider, <b>translator,</b> customer service and technological support. Equally important is the co-operation with existing reservation system provider, cashier system provider and membership system provider. The main conclusions of the research were that: business biosphere appears to be applicable framework to analyzing potential markets, there can be seen market potential for the projector-sensor technology in hospitality environment and when developing value propositions further, the economic, technological and social views should all be considered. The individual notions of the interviews conducted within this research also seemed to follow the major trends of the industry, suggesting, that the framework would be applicable also in other time or place...|$|R
