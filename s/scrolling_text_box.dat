40|$|Tree of Fortune was a {{major public}} artwork {{comprising}} of 130 LED <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> <b>boxes</b> distributed throughout a large tree. Each module displayed an individual scrolling message presented in red LED text, created in collaboration with Brisbane writer Linda Carolli. The work was commissioned for and presented in a prominent riverbank location at Christchurch’s 2004 Biennial. It {{was accompanied by a}} high quality catalogue publication. [...] - The project sought to foster private reflection amongst its viewers around the context of contemporary ecological crises, whilst also calling upon the power of their imagining as a method for retaining positive and critical mindsets in the face of adversity. This was achieved through ostensibly presenting texts in the form of ‘fortune cookie’ style statements, but then configuring them to require a personal response. This sense of unraveling questions and answers was further cemented through the qualities of each <b>scrolling</b> <b>text,</b> which only revealed a small part of each phrase at any one time. ...|$|R

40|$|Unbearable Lightness was {{a public}} artwork of 110 LED <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> <b>boxes</b> {{distributed}} throughout the canopy of a large, mature tree, located in a high traffic location in a major Brisbane Parkland. The work was a major commission for the Southbank Corporation Public Art Program and was exhibited during the three months around Christmas and New Year 2003. Each text module displayed individual LED scrolling messages developed during collaboration with locally based hypertext writer, Linda Carolli. Set {{during the time of}} the highly contentious Invasion of Iraq, the texts posed open questions around the themes of lightness, thinness and emptiness with the aim of promoting contentions of hope in a time of painful impotence for concerned citizens. [...] - The text modules were positioned in sympathy with the position of major constellations in the night sky at that time whilst the design alluded to Martin Luther’s original Christmas tree envisaged as a mixture of ‘stars’ seen via a tree. The tree was further outlined and highlighted with blue spotlights set within its crown. The project required the design, networking and ruggedisation of the work’s waterproof electronic modules – assisted by an electronic designer. These modules were later re-purposed into a range of other works and formats. [...] - Set within the context of major antiwar protests of that era, the project sought to foster private reflection amongst its viewers whilst also calling upon the power of their personal and collective imagining as a method for retaining positive and critical mindsets in the face of such painful social and political adversities. The work became a strong focus of attention within the park and generated nightly debate and enthusiastic spoken reading sessions. ...|$|R
40|$|Whisper Our Futures was an invited design {{proposal}} {{to produce a}} major public artwork for the State of Queensland’s 150 th Anniversary Celebrations. It involved a network of 100 individual <b>scrolling</b> digital <b>text</b> <b>boxes</b> each with individual audio systems arranged together in a tessellated format. This form (specified by the originating brief) both mimicked the soaring gothic arches typical of Queensland cathedrals and was also suggestive of their stained glass windows. Each text module presented a message in both visual and audible forms for Queenslanders living 150 years hence - spoken both {{by the general public}} aw well as prominent figures. In this way the work was designed as a focus of future hope, historical reflection and inspiration to visitors to Queensland cathedrals throughout the entire year of celebrations (2009). The work was planned to premiere at Brisbane’s main Anglican Cathedral and then tour to nine other state cathedrals throughout 2009. [...] Two staged proposals and budgets were invited throughout 2007. After the second successful proposal stage the State Premier and cabinet changed, ultimately leading the public art components to be dropped from the program. The proposal currently remains on file at the Queensland Premiers Office. ...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} are reported investigating oculomotor behavior and linguistic processing when reading dynamic horizontally <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> (compared to reading normal static text). Three factors known to modulate processing time in normal reading were investigated: Word length and word frequency {{were examined in}} Experiment 1, and target word predictability in Experiment 2. An analysis of global oculomotor behavior across the 2 experiments showed that participants made fewer and longer fixations when reading <b>scrolling</b> <b>text,</b> with shorter progressive and regressive saccades between these fixations. Comparisons of the linguistic manipulations showed evidence of a dissociation between word-level and sentence-level processing. Word-level processing (Experiment 1) was preserved for the dynamic <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> condition with no difference in length and frequency effects between <b>scrolling</b> and static <b>text</b> formats. However, sentence-level integration (Experiment 2) was reduced for scrolling compared to static text in that we obtained no early facilitation effect for predictable words under <b>scrolling</b> <b>text</b> conditions. </p...|$|R

Results indicated a significant effect of order in which participants received the texts, but not a significant effect of <b>text</b> <b>box</b> presence.
