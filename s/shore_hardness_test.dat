The correlation between <b>shore</b> <b>hardness</b> and linear elastic and hyperelastic properties has been systematically investigated. A detailed FE model of the <b>shore</b> A <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> has been developed with re-meshing functions in order {{to cope with the}} large deformation during simulation of <b>shore</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>tests</b> over a range of E values. The model is used in modelling <b>shore</b> A <b>hardness</b> on samples with standard thickness (over 6 mm) and the result is validated against published experimental data. FE indentation models of thin samples are then developed and successfully used to predict the <b>shore</b> <b>hardness</b> of thinner samples over a property range relevant to gasket applications. A chart linking <b>shore</b> <b>hardness,</b> Young’s modulus and samples thickness is established and used to analyse <b>shore</b> <b>hardness</b> of three cases including silicone rubber made in the lab with different thicknesses, thin silicone rubber gasket and an EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) gasket for plate heat exchangers. In all of the cases, the estimated E values based on <b>shore</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>tests</b> are able to predict the deformation of the material under different loading conditions including tensile and compression tests on samples of different shapes. In <b>shore</b> OO <b>hardness</b> modelling, the numerical results show a good agreement with analytical solution for spherical indenters.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>Shore</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> {{has been}} widely used and has become the {{standard}} for characterizing materials in the rubber and plastics industries. The obtained hardness scale values, ASTM or IRHD, are often related to the static elastic properties of rubber like-materials. Recently, progress {{on the problem of}} obtaining dynamic viscoelastic properties has been made through the use of an oscillating spherical indentor and modeling the measured input impedance by the radiation impedance of a radiating sphere. When the sphere radius is small, such that ka<<l for longitudinal waves, then the measured shear modulus and loss factor is in good agreement with that found using other dynamic methods such as the DMTA. This model is appropriate only for relatively soft materials or very thick hard materials where the thickness of the material can be ignored. The object of the current work is to extend the methodology to layers of finite thickness. The problem is studied under the assumptions of linear lasticity and the condition that there is perfect adhesion between the indentor and the elastic layer. The method of solution that is adopted will be described and as such it constitutes the first serious attempt to solve an elastodynamic boundary value problem of this type. 1...|$|E

30|$|Generally, {{the larger}} {{difference}} in mechanical contributions apparently {{gives rise to}} the larger differences amongst the components of the material tangent stiffness matrix and therefore leads to the ill-conditioned stiffness matrix. The similar ill-conditioning is known from the simulation of composite structures comprising two main constituents with a great difference in mechanical stiffness. Typical examples of this are the organic-coated metals. Throughout the investigation of the ill-conditioning problem, the magnitude of μ strongly affects the simulation accuracy of the Holzapfel model but has no influence on the accuracy of the neo-Hookean model. Therefore, the thickening effect does not originate from the “fibre rotation” as discussed by Gasser et al. [11]. Moreover, the shear modulus also significantly influences the numerical stability of the MFH model but has no effect on any isotropic Fung-type model (Duong [17]). It accounts for the ill-conditioning problem, which results from the large condition numbers of the elasticity tensors of the Holzapfel model and the MFH model. Since the shear modulus μ of soft tissue usually varies in a bounded set, the shear modulus μ should be chosen closer to the physically upper bound (its natural value). Alternatively, <b>Shore</b> <b>hardness</b> indentation <b>tests</b> could be used to measure the shear modulus of the matrix directly (Duong [17]). These measured values of the shear modulus help ensure the numerical stability of the material law (Duong [17]).|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a novel method for accelerated wear of squeegees used in screen printing and describes {{the development of}} mechanical tests which allow more in-depth measurement of squeegee properties. In this study, squeegees were abraded on the screen press {{so that they could}} be used for subsequent print tests to evaluate the effect of wear on the printed product. Squeegee wear was found to vary between different squeegee types and caused increases in ink transfer and wider printed features. In production this will lead to greater ink consumption, cost per unit and a likelihood of product failure. This also has consequences for the production of functional layers, etc., used in the construction of printed electronics. While more wear generally gave greater increases in ink deposition, the effect of wear differed, depending on the squeegee. There was a correlation between the angle of the squeegee wear and ink film thickness from a worn squeegee. An ability to resist flexing gave a high wear angle and presented a sharper edge at the squeegee/screen interface thus mitigating the effect of wear. There was also a good correlation between resistance to flexing and ink film thickness for unworn squeegees, which was more effective than a comparison based on <b>Shore</b> A <b>hardness.</b> Squeegee indentation at different force levels gave more information than a standard <b>Shore</b> A <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> and the apparatus used was able to reliably measure reductions in surface hardness due to solvent absorption.

For many years, mould designers and researcher have been trying to improve the performance of cooling system, despite the fact that cooling system complexity is physically limited by fabrication capability of conventional straight drilling methods. This research presents a comprehensive investigation on the application of conformal cooling channels in injection moulding for different cross sectional shapes, positions and diameter by endeavoring which conformal cooling configuration gives the best results in comparison with conventional cooling channels. Mould design with efficient cooling channels, comprehensive finite element analysis and flow simulation have been performed for different plastic parts with Pro/Engineer, ANSYS and Autodesk Moldflow Insight simulation software. Structural-thermal finite element analysis has been performed for two different types of industrial plastic part moulds with conventional, conformal and bimetallic conformal cooling channels to study the robustness and longevity of the conformal cooling channel moulds in comparison with conventional cooling channel moulds. Fatigue life of the mould with different cooling channel configuration and different materials has also been predicted using high cycle fatigue formulas and stress analysis results.

This conversion is made possible through the Distillation Assembly (DA) of the UPA. One component of the DA is a molded circular piston cup made of virgin polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The piston cup is assembled to a titanium component using eight fasteners and washers. Molded PTFE produced for spare piston cups {{in the first quarter}} of 2010 was different in appearance and texture, and softer than material molded for previous cups. For the suspect newer PTFE material, cup fasteners were tightened to only one-half the required torque value, yet the washers embedded almost halfway into the material. The molded PTFE used in the DA piston cup should be Type II, based on AMS 3667 D and ASTM D 4894 specifications. The properties of molded PTFE are considerably different between Type I and II materials. Engineers working with the DA thought that if Type I PTFE was molded by mistake instead of Type II material, that could have resulted in the anomalous material properties. Typically, the vendor molds flat sheet PTFE from the same material lot used to mold the piston cups, and tensile testing as part of quality control should verify that the PTFE is Type II material.

Four different 100 % coarse count cotton yarns (Ne 10 / 1, Ne 12 / 1, Ne 14 / 1, andNe 16 / 1) were spun with various front roller rubber cot hardness from 65 °, 68 °, 70 °, 75 °, and 83 ° <b>shore</b> <b>hardness</b> with constant back cot roller <b>shore</b> <b>hardness.</b> Cotton yarn properties were investigated, including mass uniformity, imperfection level, unevenness, hairiness, tensile strength, and elongation. The results showed that as the <b>shore</b> <b>hardness</b> increased, the unevenness of mass and imperfection index of the yarns proportionally increased. It does not apparently influence the yarns’ hairiness, tensile strength, or elongation properties...|$|R
