5|$|<b>Sucrose</b> {{is found}} in the stems of {{sugarcane}} and roots of sugar beet. It also occurs naturally alongside fructose and glucose in other plants, in particular fruits and some roots such as carrots. The different proportions of sugars found in these foods determines the range of sweetness experienced when eating them. A molecule of <b>sucrose</b> is formed by the combination of a molecule of glucose with a molecule of fructose. After being eaten, <b>sucrose</b> is split into its constituent parts during digestion by a number of enzymes known as sucrases.|$|E
5|$|The fructose/glucose {{ratio is}} {{calculated}} {{by dividing the}} sum of free fructose plus half <b>sucrose</b> by the sum of free glucose plus half <b>sucrose.</b>|$|E
5|$|Carrots are 88% water, 4.7% sugar, 0.9% protein, 2.8% {{dietary fiber}}, 1% ash and 0.2% fat. Carrot dietary fiber {{comprises}} mostly cellulose, with smaller proportions of hemicellulose, lignin and starch. Free sugars in carrot include <b>sucrose,</b> glucose and fructose.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by the National Institute of Beekeeping in Bologna, Italy, found pollen obtained from seeds dressed with imidacloprid contain significant levels of the insecticide, and suggested the polluted pollen might cause honey bee colony death. Analysis of maize and sunflower crops originating from seeds dressed with imidacloprid suggest large amounts of the insecticide will be carried back to honey bee colonies. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in <b>sucrose</b> solution have also been documented to affect homing and foraging activity of honey bees. Imidacloprid in <b>sucrose</b> solution fed to bees in the laboratory impaired their communication for a few hours. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in laboratory and field experiment decreased flight activity and olfactory discrimination, and olfactory learning performance was impaired.|$|E
5|$|Lactose, maltose, and <b>sucrose</b> are all {{compound}} sugars, disaccharides, {{with the}} general formula C12H22O11. They are formed by the combination of two monosaccharide molecules with the exclusion of a molecule of water.|$|E
5|$|Refined {{sugar is}} made from raw sugar that has {{undergone}} a refining process to remove the molasses. Raw sugar is <b>sucrose</b> which is extracted from sugarcane or sugar beet. While raw sugar can be consumed, the refining process removes unwanted tastes and results in refined sugar or white sugar.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{ingredient}} in maple syrup is the sap from the xylem of sugar maple or various {{other species of}} maple trees. It consists primarily of <b>sucrose</b> and water, with small amounts of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose from the invert sugar created in the boiling process.|$|E
5|$|Fructose, {{or fruit}} sugar, occurs {{naturally}} in fruits, some root vegetables, cane sugar and honey {{and is the}} sweetest of the sugars. It {{is one of the}} components of <b>sucrose</b> or table sugar. It is used as a high-fructose syrup, which is manufactured from hydrolyzed corn starch that has been processed to yield corn syrup, with enzymes then added to convert part of the glucose into fructose.|$|E
5|$|Maltose {{is formed}} during the {{germination}} of certain grains, {{the most notable}} being barley, which is converted into malt, {{the source of the}} sugar's name. A molecule of maltose is formed by the combination of two molecules of glucose. It is less sweet than glucose, fructose or <b>sucrose.</b> It is formed in the body during the digestion of starch by the enzyme amylase and is itself broken down during digestion by the enzyme maltase.|$|E
5|$|Ochetellus ants are omnivores {{that feed}} {{primarily}} on arthropods, but they show {{a preference for}} fluids and sweets when they enter human houses. Workers will prey on Ornithoptera richmondia eggs, fruit fly pupae, Plutella larvae and attack wasp nests. Honeydew, nectar, Pacific reef heron feces, carrion, Pandanus fruits, plants, seeds, <b>sucrose,</b> fats and grease will also be consumed. O. glaber is known to exploit the extrafloral nectaries on plants without providing protection.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} innovations of UPLB was the production of CAC 87 sugar cane in 1919. This high-yielding variety is resistant to fiji and mosaic viruses, and produces more <b>sucrose</b> than other varieties. Its derivatives significantly increased sugar cane production in the Philippines. Between 1921 and 1939, cattle, poultry, and swine breeding programs produced new breeds, namely the Philamin (a hybrid of the Hereford, Nellore and native cattle), Berkjala (a variety of the Berkshire and local Jala-Jala pig, resistant to hog cholera) and the Los Baños Cantonese chicken, which produces more eggs.|$|E
5|$|Other {{possibilities}} exist, as well. For example, immunohistochemistry usually utilizes an antibody {{to one or}} more proteins {{of interest}} that are conjugated to enzymes yielding either luminescent or chromogenic signals that can be compared between samples, allowing for localization information. Another applicable technique is cofractionation in <b>sucrose</b> (or other material) gradients using isopycnic centrifugation. While this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest, it does increase the likelihood, and is more amenable to large-scale studies.|$|E
5|$|The colonies {{are found}} in rotten wood, in the ground, under rocks or stones and in urban areas. The ants are both diurnal and nocturnal and forage on trees, in low {{vegetation}} and into human homes, where they are regarded as pests. These ants eat a variety of foods, including fruits, insects, <b>sucrose,</b> nectar and bird feces. They visit various flowers and attend {{to a variety of}} butterfly larvae. The thorny devil, an Australian lizard, predominantly feeds on Ochetellus workers, and other ant species also prey on them.|$|E
5|$|Monosaccharides in a closed-chain form {{can form}} glycosidic bonds with other monosaccharides, {{creating}} disaccharides (such as <b>sucrose)</b> and polysaccharides (such as starch). Enzymes must hydrolyze or otherwise break these glycosidic bonds before such compounds become metabolized. After digestion and absorption the principal monosaccharides {{present in the}} blood and internal tissues include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Many pentoses and hexoses can form ring structures. In these closed-chain forms, the aldehyde or ketone group remains non-free, {{so many of the}} reactions typical of these groups cannot occur. Glucose in solution exists mostly in the ring form at equilibrium, with less than 0.1% of the molecules in the open-chain form.|$|E
5|$|Tooth decay {{is caused}} by certain types of acid-producing {{bacteria}} which cause the most damage {{in the presence of}} fermentable carbohydrates such as <b>sucrose,</b> fructose, and glucose. The resulting acidic levels in the mouth affect teeth because a tooth's special mineral content causes it to be sensitive to low pH. Depending on the extent of tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to restore teeth to proper form, function, and aesthetics, but there is no known method to regenerate large amounts of tooth structure. Instead, dental health organizations advocate preventative and prophylactic measures, such as regular oral hygiene and dietary modifications, to avoid dental caries.|$|E
25|$|Such {{a special}} role of <b>sucrose</b> in the {{formation}} of tooth decay is much more significant in light of the almost universal use of <b>sucrose</b> as the most desirable sweetening agent. Widespread replacement of <b>sucrose</b> by high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has not diminished the danger from <b>sucrose.</b> If smaller amounts of <b>sucrose</b> are present in the diet, they will still be sufficient for the development of thick, anaerobic plaque and plaque bacteria will metabolise other sugars in the diet, such as the glucose and fructose in HFCS.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sucrose</b> {{is formed}} by plants and {{cyanobacteria}} {{but not by}} other organisms. <b>Sucrose</b> is found naturally in many food plants along with the monosaccharide fructose. In many fruits, such as pineapple and apricot, <b>sucrose</b> is the main sugar. In others, such as grapes and pears, fructose is the main sugar.|$|E
25|$|In Nature, <b>sucrose</b> {{is present}} in many plants, and in {{particular}} their roots, fruits and nectars, because {{it serves as a}} way to store energy, primarily from photosynthesis. Many mammals, birds, insects and bacteria accumulate and feed on the <b>sucrose</b> in plants and for some it is their main food source. Seen from a human consumption perspective, honeybees are especially important because they accumulate <b>sucrose</b> and produce honey, an important foodstuff all over the world. The carbohydrates in honey itself primarily consists of fructose and glucose with trace amounts of <b>sucrose</b> only.|$|E
25|$|Scientists and {{the sugar}} {{industry}} use degrees Brix (symbol °Bx), introduced by Adolf Brix, as {{units of measurement}} of the mass ratio of dissolved substance to water in a liquid. A 25 °Bx <b>sucrose</b> solution has 25grams of <b>sucrose</b> per 100grams of liquid; or, {{to put it another}} way, 25grams of <b>sucrose</b> sugar and 75grams of water exist in the 100grams of solution.|$|E
25|$|As fruits ripen, their <b>sucrose</b> content usually rise sharply, {{but some}} fruits contain almost no <b>sucrose</b> at all. This {{includes}} grapes, cherries, blueberries, blackberries, figs, pomegranates, tomatoes, avocados, lemons and limes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sucrose</b> plays {{a central}} role as an {{ingredient}} in food production and food recipes all over the world. About 175 million metric tons of <b>sucrose</b> sugar were produced worldwide in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Red Bull {{contains}} caffeine, taurine, B vitamins (B3, B5, B6, B12), <b>sucrose,</b> and glucose. To produce Red Bull Sugarfree, sugars <b>sucrose</b> and glucose {{have been}} replaced by the sweeteners acesulfame K and aspartame/sucralose.|$|E
25|$|Each ton of b yields 740 kg {{of juice}} (135 kg of <b>sucrose</b> and 605 kg of water) and 260 kg of moist bagasse (130 kg of dry bagasse). Since the {{lower heating value}} of <b>sucrose</b> is 16.5 MJ/kg, {{and that of the}} bagasse is 19.2 MJ/kg, the total heating value of a ton of b is 4.7 GJ of which 2.2 GJ come from the <b>sucrose</b> and 2.5 from the bagasse.|$|E
25|$|Sucrase is {{an enzyme}} that {{breaks down the}} {{disaccharide}} <b>sucrose,</b> commonly known as table sugar, cane sugar, or beet sugar. <b>Sucrose</b> digestion yields the sugars fructose and glucose which are readily absorbed by the small intestine.|$|E
25|$|Xylem sap {{consumption}} may {{be related}} to osmoregulation. High osmotic pressure in the stomach, caused by high <b>sucrose</b> concentration, can lead to water transfer from the hemolymph to the stomach, thus resulting in hyperosmotic stress and eventually to the death of the insect. Aphids avoid this fate by osmoregulating through several processes. <b>Sucrose</b> concentration is directly reduced by assimilating <b>sucrose</b> toward metabolism and by synthesizing oligosaccharides from several <b>sucrose</b> molecules, thus reducing the solute concentration and consequently the osmotic pressure. Oligasaccharides are then excreted through honeydew, explaining its high sugar concentrations, which can then be used by other animals such as ants. Furthermore, water is transferred from the hindgut, where osmotic pressure has already been reduced, to the stomach to dilute stomach content. Eventually, aphids consume xylem sap to dilute the stomach osmotic pressure. All these processes function synergetically, and enable aphids to feed on high-sucrose-concentration plant sap, as well as to adapt to varying <b>sucrose</b> concentrations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sucrose</b> is {{an easily}} assimilated {{macronutrient}} {{that provides a}} quick source of energy, provoking a rapid rise in blood glucose upon ingestion. <b>Sucrose,</b> as a pure carbohydrate, has an energy content of 3.94kilocalories per gram (or 17kilojoules per gram).|$|E
25|$|<b>Sucrose</b> can {{contribute}} to the development of metabolic syndrome. In an experiment with rats that were fed a diet one-third of which was <b>sucrose,</b> the <b>sucrose</b> first elevated blood levels of triglycerides, which induced visceral fat and ultimately resulted in insulin resistance. Another study found that rats fed sucrose-rich diets developed high triglycerides, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance. A 2004 study recommended that the consumption of sucrose-containing drinks should be limited due to the growing number of people with obesity and insulin resistance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sucrose</b> {{does not}} melt at high temperatures. Instead, it decomposes—at —to form caramel. Like other carbohydrates, it combusts to {{carbon dioxide and}} water. Mixing <b>sucrose</b> with the {{oxidizer}} potassium nitrate produces the fuel known as rocket candy {{that is used to}} propel amateur rocket motors.|$|E
25|$|Honey bee {{sensitivity}} to different concentrations of <b>sucrose</b> {{is determined by}} a reflex known as the proboscis extension response or PER. Different species of honey bees that employ different foraging behaviors will vary in the concentration of <b>sucrose</b> that elicits their proboscis extension response.|$|E
25|$|Hydrolysis {{breaks the}} glycosidic bond {{converting}} <b>sucrose</b> into glucose and fructose. Hydrolysis is, however, so slow that solutions of <b>sucrose</b> can sit {{for years with}} negligible change. If the enzyme sucrase is added, however, the reaction will proceed rapidly. Hydrolysis can also be accelerated with acids, such as cream of tartar or lemon juice, both weak acids. Likewise, gastric acidity converts <b>sucrose</b> to glucose and fructose during digestion, the bond between them being an acetal bond {{which can be broken}} by an acid.|$|E
25|$|Table sugar (<b>sucrose)</b> {{comes from}} plant sources. Two {{important}} sugar crops predominate: sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) and sugar beets (Beta vulgaris), in which sugar {{can account for}} 12% to 20% of the plant's dry weight. Minor commercial sugar crops include the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), sorghum (Sorghum vulgare), and the sugar maple (Acer saccharum). <b>Sucrose</b> is obtained by extraction of these crops with hot water, concentration of the extract gives syrups, from which solid <b>sucrose</b> can be crystallized. In 2013, worldwide production of table sugar amounted to 175 million tonnes.|$|E
25|$|Overconsumption of <b>sucrose</b> {{has been}} linked with adverse health effects.|$|E
25|$|When {{large amounts}} of refined food that contain high {{percentages}} of <b>sucrose</b> are consumed, beneficial nutrients can be displaced from the diet, which can contribute to an increased risk for chronic disease. The rapidity with which <b>sucrose</b> raises blood glucose can cause problems for people suffering from defective glucose metabolism, such as persons with hypoglycemia or diabetes mellitus.|$|E
25|$|In {{humans and}} other mammals, <b>sucrose</b> is {{broken down into}} its {{constituent}} monosaccharides, glucose and fructose, by sucrase or isomaltase glycoside hydrolases, which {{are located in the}} membrane of the microvilli lining the duodenum. The resulting glucose and fructose molecules are then rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream. In bacteria and some animals, <b>sucrose</b> is digested by the enzyme invertase.|$|E
25|$|In the USA {{there are}} tariffs on the {{importation}} of sugar, and subsidies {{for the production of}} maize (corn). High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is derived from corn, and significantly cheaper there than <b>sucrose</b> as a sweetener. This has led to <b>sucrose</b> being partially displaced in U.S. industrial food production by HFCS and other non-sucrose natural sweeteners.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} soluble carbohydrates {{of mature}} soybeans are the disaccharide <b>sucrose</b> (range 2.5–8.2%), the trisaccharide raffinose (0.1–1.0%) composed of one <b>sucrose</b> molecule connected to one molecule of galactose, and the tetrasaccharide stachyose (1.4 to 4.1%) composed of one <b>sucrose</b> connected to two molecules of galactose. While the oligosaccharides raffinose and stachyose protect {{the viability of}} the soybean seed from desiccation (see above section on physical characteristics) they are not digestible sugars, so contribute to flatulence and abdominal discomfort in humans and other monogastric animals, comparable to the disaccharide trehalose. Undigested oligosaccharides are broken down in the intestine by native microbes, producing gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane.|$|E
