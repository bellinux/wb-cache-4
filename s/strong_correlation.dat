This metabolic pathway leads to two major inactive metabolites (which each account for around 45% and 10% of an excreted dose at steady state), one minor metabolite, and several trace metabolites, none of which {{accounts for more than}} 1% of an excreted dose. Clearance of linezolid varies with age and gender; it is fastest in children (which accounts for the shorter half-life), and appears to be 20% lower in women than in men.

Hatzes made radial velocity observations of Epsilon Eridani, measuring the Doppler shift of the star {{along the line of}} sight. They found evidence of a planet orbiting the star with a period of about seven years. Although there is a high level of noise in the radial velocity data due to magnetic activity in its photosphere, any periodicity caused by this magnetic activity is expected to show a <b>strong</b> <b>correlation</b> with variations in emission lines of ionized calcium (the Ca II H and K lines). Because no such correlation was found, a planetary companion was deemed the most likely cause. This discovery was supported by astrometric measurements of Epsilon Eridani made between 2001 and 2003 with the Hubble Space Telescope, which showed evidence for gravitational perturbation of Epsilon Eridani by a planet.|$|E

40|$|This paper reports all-atom {{computer}} simulations of five phospholipid membranes (DMPC, DPPC, DMPG, DMPS, and DMPSH) with {{focus on the}} thermal equilibrium fluctuations of volume, energy, area, thickness, and chain order. At constant temperature and pressure, volume and energy exhibit <b>strong</b> <b>correlations</b> of their slow fluctuations (defined by averaging over 0. 5 nanosecond). These quantities, on the other hand, do not correlate significantly with area, thickness, or chain order. The correlations are mainly reported for the fluid phase, but we also give some results for the ordered (gel) phase of two membranes, showing a similar picture. The cause of the observed <b>strong</b> <b>correlations</b> is identified by splitting volume and energy into contributions from tails, heads, and water, and showing that the slow volume-energy fluctuations derive from van der Waals interactions of the tail region; they are thus analogous to the similar <b>strong</b> <b>correlations</b> recently observed in {{computer simulations}} of the Lennard-Jones and other simple van der Waals type liquids [U.

40|$|The most {{striking}} and counterintuitive consequences {{of quantum mechanics}} play out in the <b>strong</b> <b>correlations</b> of many-particle systems.

In this thesis we present a convergent and systematically improvable series of approximations to the many-electron Schro &# 776;dinger equation which exploit these patterns. Two themes dominate the work: the use of bonding electron pairs as local units for developing efficient models, and an exponential parameterization of the many-electron wave-function...|$|R
