40|$|The {{generation}} of tritium during the electrolysis of aqueous light water alkali carbonate (K 2 CO 3 and Li 2 CO 3) solutions by nickel cathodes, first reported by {{us at the}} International Conference on Cold Fusion- 3 (Nagoya, Japan, October 1992) has once again been verified and confirmed. During 1993, 10 out of 23 cells, whose electrolytes were analyzed using a newly set up dedicated liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>counting</b> <b>unit,</b> indicated low tritium levels in the electrolyte, {{in the range of}} 0. 5 to 4. 8 Bq/ml. Except one cell, which contained 25 % D 2 O, the remaining nine cells, which produced tritium, were charged with natural light water solutions only. Two of these cells, which were monitored for tritium every few days, and excluding cell OM- 3, which was set up in 1992, indicated tritium level variations in a sawtooth fashion, suggesting the possible presence of an as yet unidentified mechanism responsible for periodically removing tritium from the electrolyte...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. In liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>{{counting}},</b> a high {{counting efficiency}} is desired to reduce counting times, {{to improve the}} energy resolution of measured spectra, and, last but not least, to reduce {{the uncertainty of the}} activity determination. The design of the optical chamber of a counting system as well as the selection of appropriate vials requires the analysis of many parameters. In this work, digital photography is used to obtain quantitative information on the distribution and intensity of the light emission. In addition, ray-tracing techniques are applied to simulate the light collection within the optical chamber of a liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>counting</b> system...|$|R

In total, 26 laboratories participated in the proficiency test. Most laboratories (19) used the equipment based on gamma spectrometry (RADEK MKGB- 01) for measurement of radon. Six laboratories measured radon with liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>counting.</b> In this proficiency test two ground water samples were tested, in which one contained high radon concentration (1000 – 5000 Bq/l) and the other contained lower concentration of radon (< 1000 Bq/l).

In total 86 % of the results was satisfactory when the result measured with Radek equipment was accepted to deviate 20 % and 25 % from the assigned value and the result measured with the liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>counting</b> was accepted to deviate 10 % and 15 %from the assigned value...|$|R

40|$|The binding of {{the novel}} drug 3 H-LBT 3004, labeled with tritium 3 H, to {{serotonin}} (5 -HT) receptors was analysed using one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Proteins from the mammalian mouse brain were separated using a 1 mm 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the protein bands were detected using Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining technique. Three lanes were used for liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>counting</b> in 3 H quantification. The other three lanes were used for Western Blotting onto PVDF membrane that was utilized in direct autoradiography. Results of the liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>counting</b> produced two peaks of high counts per minute. A calibration plot was also done to confirm the linear relationship between relative mobilities of protein markers and their known molecular masses. It was utilized in the determination of molecular weights of the proteins that produced the two peaks. Direct autoradiography showed no indication of binding between drug and protein, though liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>counting</b> concluded that the drug bound to proteins other than serotonin receptors but does not conclude that the drug does not bind to serotonin receptors.

40|$|Accurate {{staging of}} the {{regional}} lymph nodes is crucial for the appropriate management of patients with squamous cell carcinoma {{of the head and}} neck (HNSCC). However, the current diagnostic modalities have low accuracy for N 0 neck, and even the most optimal procedure, ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (USgFNAC), still has a sensitivity of only 42 %- 73 %. In this study we evaluated whether the identification of the sentinel node might improve the selection of lymph nodes for USgFNAC. Twelve HNSCC patients received 3 - 4 peritumoral injections of 10 - 30 MBq 99 mTc-labeled colloidal albumin, and the sentinel node was identified by dynamic scintigraphy and marked on the skin using a handheld probe, and/or by <b>scintillation</b> <b>counting</b> of the aspirates. After sentinel node identification USgFNAC was performed. Correct aspiration of the identified sentinel node(s) was confirmed by <b>scintillation</b> <b>counting.</b> In 11 out of 12 cases the sentinel node(s) could be visualized by dynamic planar imaging. In one case the sentinel node(s) were identified by <b>scintillation</b> <b>counting</b> only.

Strontium- 90 in wild berries samples is determined {{in view of}} certification of this material as reference material and its activity concentration is determined by liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>counting.</b> A new method was developed and evaluated for the sequential determination of uranium and polonium radioisotopes using two different pre-concentration methods and two separation procedures. The advantage of this new method is that polonium and uranium isotopes can be determined simultaneously in the same sample. The activity concentration of 228 Ra was determined via its daughter 228 Ac with liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>counting,</b> and with a newly developed method for its determination via its granddaughter 228 Th and alpha-particle spectrometry.

Although these radioisotopes can be readily detected in well counters with solid sodium iodide crystal detectors, the ability to count gamma emitters by liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>counting</b> of-fers some advantages. The liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>counting</b> of gamma emit-ters provides additional capability for a laboratory equipped with only a liquid scintillation counter.
