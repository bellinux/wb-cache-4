5|$|Dugan {{designed}} <b>sound</b> <b>for</b> three regional {{productions of}} Hair, the musical: ones in Chicago, Las Vegas and Toronto. The Chicago production ran in 1969 and 1970 at the Blackstone Theatre, operated {{at that time}} by The Shubert Organization. Dugan was able to design sound but not allowed to operate the mixing console {{because he was not}} in the stagehands union: International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE).|$|E
5|$|Just one sound can be {{complete}} in itself, for its complexity {{lies in the}} formulation of ma, an unquantifiable metaphysical space (duration) of dynamically tensed absence of <b>sound.</b> <b>For</b> example, in the performance of nō, the ma of sound and silence does not have an organic relation for the purpose of artistic expression. Rather, these two elements contrast sharply with one another in an immaterial balance.|$|E

5|$|Like all cetaceans, {{killer whales}} depend heavily on {{underwater}} <b>sound</b> <b>for</b> orientation, feeding, and communication.

5|$|Vehicle <b>Sound</b> <b>for</b> Pedestrians or VSP is a Nissan-developed warning {{sound system}} in {{electric}} vehicles. The Nissan Leaf {{was the first}} car manufactured by Nissan to include VSP, and the electric car includes one <b>sound</b> <b>for</b> forward motion and another for reverse. The VSP was also used in the Nissan Fuga hybrid launched in 2011. The system developed makes a noise easy to hear for those outside {{to be aware of}} the vehicle approaching, but the warning sounds do not distract the car occupants inside. Nissan explained that during the development of the sound they studied behavioral research of the visually impaired and worked with cognitive and acoustic psychologists, including the National Federation of the Blind, the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology, experts from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a Hollywood sound design studio.|$|E
5|$|When Margrit Mondavi {{founded the}} Mondavi Summer Music Festival in 1969 at the Robert Mondavi Winery, {{primarily}} featuring jazz artists, Dugan supplied sound {{services at the}} outdoor venue in Napa, California.

5|$|A {{longtime}} {{fan of the}} English trip hop group Portishead, West {{had been}} significantly influenced by Roseland NYC Live, the band's 1998 live album with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip hop production. Though West {{had not been able}} to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album. West juxtaposed the lush, intricate melodies of the string section with the hard, pounding drum rhythms of hip-hop, and used the <b>sound</b> <b>for</b> the foundation of his rapping.|$|E
5|$|After being {{signed by}} Mercury Records, the New York Dolls {{released}} their self-titled debut album in 1973 to poor sales. Although it was praised by critics, {{the band was}} not satisfied with producer Todd Rundgren's <b>sound</b> <b>for</b> the album and had disagreements with him before choosing not to retain him. Songwriting and production partners Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller were originally enlisted to produce their next album, while the band's guitarist Johnny Thunders wanted to produce it himself. However, Leiber and Stoller withdrew shortly before recording was to begin. The group held a single session with Mercury A executive Paul Nelson at Media Sound Recording Studios, where they recorded 14 songs, {{most of which were}} covers.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of The Jazz Singer, all the major film {{companies}} were racing to hire audio engineers so they could record and reproduce <b>sound</b> <b>for</b> film. Through common acquaintances at Electrical Research Products, Inc. (ERPI) within Western Electric, Hilliard was contacted and hired by United Artists Studios (UA) in Hollywood, California in 1928 because of his studies in physics, engineering and acoustics. Having left his Masters studies behind in Minnesota, Hilliard, not yet 28 years old, supervised all sound recording for Coquette, UA's first talking motion picture. Western Electric provided recording equipment, but the specific techniques for achieving best sound on film had to be developed by hard work and imagination. Hilliard's ground-breaking methods later became industry standards.|$|E

5|$|Around 52 {{minutes and}} 47 seconds into the film, when Shatner {{is talking about}} the other Original Series actors disliking him, he shifts in his chair and a sound evocative of {{flatulence}} is audible. This sound, apparently unnoticed by the filmmakers, was first mentioned in the media by Adam Buckman in the New York Post on October 10, 2001. Buckman wrote that he played the <b>sound</b> <b>for</b> more than six colleagues who all agreed that it came from Shatner. This scene became a popular subject of flatulence humor among Star Trek fans and on morning zoo radio programs. Reviewers identified as many as six other similar noises in Mind Meld, between the 52-minute mark and the end.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} live {{in groups}} typically of 10–30 members, called pods, but group size varies from single {{individuals up to}} more than 1,000. Their diets consist mainly of forage fish. Dolphins often work as a team to harvest fish schools, but they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation, which is similar to sonar. They emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echos to determine the location and shape of nearby items, including potential prey. Bottlenose dolphins also use <b>sound</b> <b>for</b> communication, including squeaks and whistles, as well as sounds emitted through body movements, such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the water surface.|$|E
5|$|Bouyon (Boo-Yon) {{is a form}} {{of popular}} music of Dominica, also known as jump up music in Guadeloupe and Martinique. The best-known band in the genre is Windward Caribbean Kulture (WCK), who {{originated}} the style in 1988 by experimenting elements of kadans (or cadence-lypso), lapo kabwit drumming, the folk style jing-ping, and a quick-paced electronic drum pattern. From a language perspective, Bouyon draws on English and Dominican Creole French. More recently, deejays with raggamuffin-style vocals (bouyon-muffin) have moved to the fore, updating the <b>sound</b> <b>for</b> the New Generation.|$|E

5|$|Competition with {{fishermen}} {{also led}} to killer whales being regarded as pests. In {{the waters of the}} Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of killer whales was accepted and even encouraged by governments. As an indication of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the killer whales captured in Puget <b>Sound</b> <b>for</b> aquarium through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of killer whales in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine-guns, rockets, and depth charges.|$|E
5|$|Filming for Live Free or Die Hard {{started in}} {{downtown}} Baltimore, Maryland on September 23, 2006. Eight different sets were {{built on a}} large soundstage for filming many scenes throughout the film. When recording the <b>sound</b> <b>for</b> the semi trailer used {{in one of the}} film's final scenes, 18 microphones were used to record the engine, tires, and damage to the vehicle. Post-production for the film only took 16 weeks, when it was more common for similar films to use 26 weeks.|$|E
5|$|I Want You {{consisted}} of Gaye's first recorded studio material since his highly successful and well-received album Let's Get It On (1973). While it marked {{a change in}} musical direction for Gaye, departing from his trademark Motown and doo-wop-influenced <b>sound</b> <b>for</b> funky, light-disco soul, the album maintained and expanded on his previous work's sexual themes. Following a mixed response from critics {{at the time of}} its release, I Want You has earned retrospective recognition from writers and music critics as one of Gaye's most controversial works and influential to such musical styles as disco, quiet storm, R, and neo soul.|$|E
