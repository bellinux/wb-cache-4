40|$|The {{survival}} of motor neurons (SMN) complex mediates {{the assembly of}} small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) involved in splicing and histone RNA processing. A crucial step in this process is the binding of Sm proteins onto the SMN protein. For Sm B/B', D 1, and D 3, efficient binding to SMN depends on <b>symmetrical</b> <b>dimethyl</b> arginine (sDMA) modifications of their RG-rich tails. This methylation is achieved by another entity, the PRMT 5 complex. Its pICln subunit binds Sm proteins whereas the PRMT 5 subunit catalyzes the methylation reaction. Here, we provide evidence that Lsm 10 and Lsm 11, which replace the Sm proteins D 1 and D 2 in the histone RNA processing U 7 snRNPs, associate with pICln in vitro and in vivo without receiving sDMA modifications. This implies that the PRMT 5 complex is involved in {{an early stage of}} U 7 snRNP assembly and hence may have a second snRNP assembly function unrelated to sDMA modification. We also show that the binding of Lsm 10 and Lsm 11 to SMN is independent of any methylation activity. Furthermore, we present evidence for two separate binding sites in SMN for Sm/Lsm proteins.

There are different methods for production of this material. One of the more efficient ones which results in higher yields compared to others is the catalytic hydrogenation of Nitroso Dimethylamine (NDMA). In this work hydrogenation of NDMA to UDMH on a 5 % Pd/C in aqueous solution of NDMA was studied experimentally. Experiments were carried out in a Semi-batch three phase STR reactor under constant pressure and temperature {{in the range of}} 40 to 70 °C, pressures of up to 15 bar and an NDMA concentration of 40 to 70 wt%. Products were analyzed using the Gas Chromatographic (GC) technique. Effects of temperature, pressure and NDMA concentration on NDMA conversion and yield of UDMH product in the presence of undesired dimethylamine (DMA) were studied and the optimum conditions for the selective production of UDMH were sought. A kinetic model based on the general form of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood(LH) equation was developed. Further, it was assumed that the hydrogen adsorption is dissociative and non competitive. Comparison with experimental data showed that the Eley-Rideal(ER) model has very good predictive capabilities relative to LH rate equation and therefore, it was selected for further study. Based on this relation the reaction parameters for UDMH and DMA rate equations were estimated through the non linear regression method and activation energies of UDMH and DMA reactions were determined to be 15. 97 and 64. 98 KJ/mol, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The use of onboard rocket {{propellants}} (dense liquids at room temperature) {{in place}} of conventional cryogenic fuel-cell reactants (hydrogen and oxygen) eliminates the mass penalties associated with cryocooling and boil-off. The high energy content and density of the rocket propellants will also require no additional chemical processing. For a 30 -day mission on the Moon that requires a continuous 100 watts of power, the reactant mass and volume would be reduced by 15 and 50 percent, respectively, even without accounting for boiloff losses. The savings increase further with increasing transit times.

Methods: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were injected <b>dimethyl</b> <b>hydrazine</b> (DMH) subcutaneously for 10 weeks, and then injected SW 480 cells in rectal mucosa to create a CRC model, and the rats were randomly divided into three groups: Control group (saline + saline), Chemotherapy group (saline + 5 -FU+Oxaliplatin), B. infantis group (B. infantis + 5 -FU+Oxaliplatin). IM was evaluated based on diarrhea severity, intestinal villus height, crypt depth, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL- 6, IL- 1 β, TNF-α), T cell subsets (CD 4 + IL 17 A+ cells and CD 4 + CD 25 + Foxp 3 + Tregs) and related cytokine profiles. Results: The {{results showed that the}} B. infantis group demonstrated a higher body weight (BW) and intestinal villus height and a deeper crypt depth compared to the Chemotherapy group. The level of IL- 6, IL- 1 β and TNF-α which increased by chemotherapy, was lowered by B. infantis administration. Real time reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed B. infantis reduced relative expression of Th 17 and Th 1 cells related cytokines, and increased relative expression of CD 4 + CD 25 + Foxp 3 + Tregs related cytokines.

40|$|Expression of {{imprinted}} genes {{is restricted}} to a single parental allele {{as a result of}} epigenetic regulation-DNA methylation and histone modifications. Igf 2 /H 19 is a reciprocally imprinted locus exhibiting paternal Igf 2 and maternal H 19 expression.

Although the de novo DNA methyltransferases {{have been shown to be}} necessary for the establishment of ICR methylation, the mechanism by which they are targeted to the region remains unknown. We demonstrate that CTCFL/BORIS, a paralog of CTCF, is an ICR-binding protein expressed during embryonic male germ cell development, coinciding with the timing of ICR methylation. PRMT 7, a protein arginine methyltransferase with which CTCFL interacts, is also expressed during embryonic testis development. <b>Symmetrical</b> <b>dimethyl</b> arginine 3 of histone H 4, a modification catalyzed by PRMT 7, accumulates in germ cells during this developmental period. This modified histone is also found enriched in both H 19 ICR and Gtl 2 differentially methylated region (DMR) chromatin of testis by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. In vitro studies demonstrate that CTCFL stimulates the histone-methyltransferase activity of PRMT 7 via interactions with both histones and PRMT 7. Finally, H 19 ICR methylation is demonstrated by nuclear co-injection of expression vectors encoding CTCFL, PRMT 7, and the de novo DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt 3 a, -b and -L, in Xenopus oocytes.

First phase in initial stage and second phase in advanced stage of colon cancer were performed respectively. Forty weeks following the first DMH injection, all survived animals were sacrificed. Then, colon and liver removed and exsanguinated by heart puncture. For measuring the levels of enzymes (AST, ALT, and ALP), a commercial kit (Parsazmoon, Iran) and an autoanalyzer (BT 3000 Pluse, Italy) were used. Results: The results showed that subcutaneous injection of DMH increased the ALT, AST, and ALP levels up to 78. 5, 161. 38, and 275. 88 U/L compared to the control, respectively. Moreover, statistical analysis in both phases of experiment revealed that the enzyme levels were decreased in the treated groups in comparison with the DMH-injected group, while the levels of these enzymes were lower in the control group.

The main cause for this state of affairs is primarily due to lack of a unified approach involving voltammetric studies, preparative experimental and proper cell design for each electrochemical process is necessary. The proper methodology for process development emphasizing the role of each of the three steps mentioned above is presented. The experimental details involved in the present research work are presented. Voltammetric studies of the organic reactants used in the present electrochemical processes studied are dealt with. Results of voltammetric studies on the electrochemical reduction of nitroso dimethyl amine (NDMA) on lead electrode in H 2 SO 4 medium are discussed. The reduction is found to be diffusion controlled with four electron transfer process under the experimental conditions. The presence of excess UDMH, the product of the electrochemical reaction, however, results in a competitive catalytic hydrogen evolution process which may greatly reduce the efficiency of the process. Voltammetric studies of the direct reduction of nitrobenzene in aqueous alcoholic as well as absolute alcoholic H 2 SO 4 solutions on copper cathode are presented. In both cases nitrobenzene is reduced in a 4 -electron step. Slight differences in the adsorption effects, however, are noticed. The direct reduction of p-nitro phenetole (PNP) as well as its indirect reduction using Ti 4 +/Ti 3 + redox system are also discussed. Redox catalytic influence of Ti 4 +/Ti 3 + redox system is clearly established in these studies. Glucose as well as lactose are not directly oxidized on glassy carbon electrode in near neutral pH conditions. The Br 2 /Br- redox couple shows quasireversible charge transfer behavior under these conditions. Voltammetric studies also indicate that the rate of chemical oxidation of glucose by electro generated Br 2 or hypobromite is much slower when compared to the electrochemical generation rate of bromine. Adsorbed lactose is much more easily oxidized when compared to solution phase lactose by reacting with electro generated bromine. Based on the voltammetric studies mentioned above, comprehensive preparative works to optimize the conditions were carried out. The optimum experimental conditions and the difficulties encountered in the electro reduction of NDMA to UDMH are presented. p-Phenetidine is easily obtained by indirect electro reduction of p-nitrophenetole using Ti 4 +/Ti 3 + redox system. It may also be obtained by reducing nitrobenzene in absolute alcoholic H 2 SO 4 medium. Although the latter process is more attractive some technical difficulties still remain. Preparative aspects of p-phenetidine from both these routes are considered. The preparative aspects of calcium-gluconate and lactobionate from glucose and lactose respectively in NaBr medium containing CaCO 3 suspensions using graphite electrodes are discussed. The influence of various experimental parameters including fluid flow is discussed. Among the three processes mentioned above the oxidation of sugars is certainly the most attractive one from the commercial point of view. Hence the cell design studies were mainly confined to this process. Tank cells have been conventionally employed for this process. The present study indicates that space time yield improves substantially in the rotating cylindrical electrode cell or more popularly known as Udupa Cell. Even greater efficiency in terms of space time yield as well as energy saving are discussed in a bipolar flow cell. A comparative discussion on both the cell designs is also presented. The scope for further development in these three processes is presented. Some recent trends in electro organic process development are also indicated. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} {{reciprocal}} competition binding experiments with mutant substrates and chemical modification interference assays to precisely define the sequences within the adeno-associated virus (AAV) terminal repeat (TR) {{that are involved}} in site-specific binding to the AAV Rep protein. Mutagenesis experiments were done with a 43 -bp oligonucleotide which contained the Rep binding element (RBE) within the A stem of the TR. Experiments in which two adjacent base pairs of the RBE were substituted simultaneously with nucleotides that produced transversions identified a 22 -bp sequence (CAGTGAGCGAGCGAGCGCGCAG) in which substitutions measurably affected the binding affinity. Although the 22 -bp RBE contains the GAGC motifs that have been found in all known Rep binding sites, our results suggest that the GAGC motifs alone are not the only sequences specifically recognized by Rep. The effects of substitutions within the 22 -bp sequence were relatively symmetrical, with nucleotides at the periphery of the RBE having the least effect on binding affinity and those in the middle having the greatest effect. Dinucleotide mutations within 18 (GTGAGCGAGCGAGC) of the 22 bp were found to decrease the binding affinity by at least threefold. Dinucleotide mutations within a 10 -bp core sequence (GCGAGCGAGC) were found to decrease binding affinity by more than 10 -fold. Single-base substitutions within the 10 -bp core sequence lowered the binding affinity by variable amounts (up to fivefold). The results of the mutagenesis analysis suggested that the A-stem RBE contains only a single Rep binding site rather than two or more independent sites. To confirm the results of the mutant analysis and to determine the relative contribution of each base to binding, chemical modification experiments using <b>dimethyl</b> sulfate and <b>hydrazine</b> were performed on both the linear A-stem sequence and the entire AAV TR in both the flip and flop hairpinned configurations. Interference assays on the linear A stem identified the 18 -bp sequence described above as essential for binding. G, C, and T residues on both strands contributed to binding, and the interference pattern correlated well with the results of the mutagenesis experiments. Interference assays with complete hairpinned TR substrates also identified the 18 -bp sequence as important for binding. However, the interference patterns on the two strands within the RBE and the relative contributions of the individual bases to binding were clearly different between the hairpinned substrates and the linear A-stem binding element. Interference assays also allowed us to search for residues within the small internal palindromes of the TR (B and C) that contribute to binding. The largest effect was seen by modification of two T residues within the sequence CTTTG. This sequence was present in the same position relative to the terminal resolution site (trs) in both the flip and flop orientations of the TR. In addition, the interference pattern suggested that the remaining bases within the CTTTG motif as well as other bases within the B and C palindromes make contacts with the Rep protein, albeit with lower affinities. Regardless of whether the TR was in the flip or flop orientation, most of the contact points were clustered in the small internal palindrome furthest away from the trs. We also determined the relative binding affinity of linear substrates containing a complete RBE with hairpinned substrates and found that linear substrates bound Rep less efficiently. Our results were consistent with our previous model that there are three distinct elements within the hairpinned AAV TR that contribute to binding affinity or to efficient nicking at the trs: the A-stem RBE, the secondary structure element which consists of the B and C palindromes, and the trs...|$|R
