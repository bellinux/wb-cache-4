YCH 2 + H 2, has been measured in crossed molecular beam scattering. Under isoenergetic conditions where the sum of available vibrational and translational energy is held constant, the vibrationally excited state is at least 2. 2 times more reactive than the ground state. The mid-infrared light source used to excite the methane is an Nd:YAGpumped pulsed optical parametric oscillator/amplifier seeded with a continuous wave laser diode in the near infrared.

Profiled steel sheeting dry board system is a composite system that can be constructed as load bearing structures building system. This panel system consists of two dry boards (cemboard) attached to profiled steel sheet (Bondek II) using mechanical connectors (<b>self-drill</b> screws) to form a core panel. PSSDB is a new innovative composite construction system with potential to be expended in application as an alternative to flooring, wall unit and roofing system.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>self-drilling</b> {{prestressed}} anchor {{is a type}} {{of ground}} anchor used to transmit the applied tensile load into soil or rock through cement grout. The paper outlines a general construction procedure using a special <b>self-drilling</b> bit.

In-situ pullout tests were carried out for three <b>self-drilling</b> prestressed anchors of the load-dispersed compression type. The test results showed that the ultimate pullout capacity could reach 800 – 1, 000 kN. After prestressing, the displacement of the anchor head was decreased by 50 % – 70 % for a low load level and 30 % – 40 % for a high load level, and the displacement induced by elastic deformation was much smaller than that induced by plastic deformation. These results demonstrate that this anchor type is suitable and economical for practical engineering needs...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{comprehensively}} analyze the potential factors affecting the failure rates of three types of mini-implants used for orthodontic anchorage. Methods: Data were collected on 727 mini-implants (miniplates, predrilled titanium miniscrews, and <b>self-drilling</b> stainless steel miniscrews) in 220 patients. The factors related to mini-implant failure were investigated using a Chi-square test for univariate analysis and a generalized estimating equation model for multivariate analysis. Results: The failure rate for miniplates was significantly lower than for miniscrews. All types of mini-implants, especially the <b>self-drilling</b> stainless steel miniscrews, showed decreased stability if the previous implantation had failed. The stability of predrilled titanium miniscrews and <b>self-drilling</b> stainless steel miniscrews were comparable at the first implantation. However, the failure rate of stainless steel miniscrews increased at the second implantation. The univariate analysis showed that the following variables had a significant influence on the failure rates of mini-implants: age of patient, type of mini-implant, site of implantation, and characteristics of the soft tissue around the mini-implants. The generalized estimating equation analysis revealed that mini-implants with miniscrews used in patients younger than 35 years, subjected to orthodontic loading after 30 days and implanted on the alveolar bone ridge, have a significantly higher risk of failure. Conclusion: This study revealed that once the dental surgeon becomes familiar with the procedure, the stability of orthodontic mini-implants depends on the type of mini-implant, age of the patient, implantation site, and the healing time of the mini-implant. Miniplates are a more feasible anchorage system when miniscrews fail repeatedly...|$|E
40|$|Having {{multiple}} external {{fixation pin}} designs and insertion techniques {{has led to}} debate as to which combination creates the stiffest construct. This study sought to biomechanically evaluate construct strength using <b>self-drilling</b> (SD) and self-tapping (ST) pins inserted with either bicortical or unicortical fixation. SD and ST 5. 0 mm stainless steel pins were used in combination with bicortical <b>self-drilling</b> (BCSD), bicortical self-tapping (BCST), unicortical <b>self-drilling</b> (UCSD), and unicortical selftapping (UCST) techniques. Pre-drilling for the self-tapping pins was completed with a 4. 0 mm drill bit using ¾ inch polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe as the insertional medium. The PVC pin constructs were then loaded to failure in a cantilever bending method using a mechanical testing system. Ten trials of each technique were analyzed. BCSD insertion technique had the highest maximum failure force and stiffness of all tested techniques (P< 0. 0001). SD pins were significantly stronger to bending forces than ST pins in both the unicortical and bicortical setting (P< 0. 0001). Three point bending tests of the 5. 0 mm SD and ST threaded area showed that threaded portion of the SD pins had a 300 N greater maximum failure force than the ST pins. Biomechanical analysis of external fixation pin insertion techniques demonstrates that bicortical fixation with SD pins achieved the greatest resistance to bending load. Despite both pins being 5. 0 mm and constructed from stainless steel, ST and SD behaved differently with regard to maximum failure force and stiffness. This study demonstrates that insertion technique and pin selection are both important variables when attempting to achieve a stiff external fixation construct...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the initial stability of dual-thread miniscrews {{by analyzing the}} strain at the bone-implant interface and insertion torque during implantation in artificial bone models with different cortical bone thicknesses. Materials and methods: Insertion torque, and strain, measured with a five-element strain gauge in 1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0 -mm artificial cortical bone, during insertion of single- (OAS-T 1507) and dual-thread (MPlant-U 3) type <b>self-drilling</b> miniscrews were assessed. Results: Both dual- and single-thread miniscrews showed greater than 7790 μstrain for all cortical bone thicknesses, and dual-thread miniscrews reached up to 19580 μstrain in 2. 00 mm cortical bone. The strain of dual-thread miniscrews increased with increasing cortical bone thicknesses of 1. 0 – 2. 0 mm. For single-thread miniscrews, the maximum insertion torque was relatively constant, but maximum insertion torque increased significantly in dual-thread groups with increasing cortical bone thicknesses (P < 0. 0001). The maximum insertion torque with all cortical bone thicknesses was significantly lower with single- than dual-thread types (P < 0. 0001).

Methods: Forty self-tapping screws and 20 <b>self-drilling</b> screws were inserted into 10 models of artificial bone and 10 cervical vertebrae of sheep.

The following groups were created: Group I-self-tapping screw insertion after pilot hole drilling and tapping; Group II-self-tapping screw insertion after pilot hole drilling without tapping; Group III-self-drilling screw insertion without drilling and tapping. In Groups I and II, the pilot hole had 14. 0 mm in depth and was made with a 3 mmn drill, while tapping was made with a 4 mm tap. The insertion torque was measured and the pullout test was performed.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Self-drilling</b> mini-implants are {{commonly}} used in orthodontics, {{but there is little}} information regarding their fracture resistance in areas of high density bone without pre-drilling. Purpose: To determine the peak fracture torques of six commonly used <b>self-drilling</b> mini-implants, and to examine how each performs in extreme conditions without pre-drilling. Materials and Methods: Fifteen mini-implants from six different manufacturers were drilled into acrylic blocks using a custom-made insertion device incorporating a 6 -DOF load cell for torque measurements. Peak fracture torques were recorded and compared for each of the six manufacturers. Additionally, ten mini-implants from each manufacturer were inserted into high density mandibular bone substitutes (Sawbones®) without pre-drilling. Measures of peak insertion torque for each manufacturer were recorded. Groups that experienced fracture upon insertion into the bone substitutes underwent further testing specifically following their manufacturer pre-drilling recommendations. Results: Resistance to fracture varied significantly among implants from different manufacturers. Tomas-pin and Aarhus experienced fractures during insertion into the non-pre-drilled bone substitutes. When manufacturer’s pre-drilling recommendations were followed, Aarhus continued to experience fractures during insertion. Conclusions: Unitek, Vector TAS, Dual Top, and Ortho Easy can be inserted into areas of thick and dense cortical bone without pre-drilling.
