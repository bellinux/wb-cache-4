5|$|Outside their tree house, Finn and Jake <b>snooze,</b> while BMO (Niki Yang) and N.E.P.T.R. (Andy Milonakis) {{play out}} a spoof of Robin Hood and the Sheriff of Nottingham. The two break open Finn and Jake's {{treasure}} room, pouring their massive stash of gold {{out into the}} yard, {{as well as the}} Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant (Steve Agee). BMO talks Finn into spending the money at an expensive resort at Wildberry Kingdom. When they arrive in the town square, Jake unloads their treasure into the city's fountain. A guard scolds them for this, but they bribe him with a few shillings and a crown, freeing them from the law. Chaos follows shortly after Jake uses wealth to control the residents. When they disrespect her authority, Wildberry Princess (Maria Bamford) orders Finn and Jake to be arrested and for their money to be seized and melted down. Her punishment is for them to be covered in the molten gold, but BMO and N.E.P.T.R. arrive just in time and save the two.|$|E

500|$|Ryan Cracknell of Apollo Movie Guide, while {{echoing the}} praise for Holden's performance, {{nonetheless}} {{found that the}} film [...] "doesn't hold up so well today". Citing {{what he sees as}} slow pacing and [...] "long bouts of over-the-top dialogue", Cracknell compares the film to [...] "reading a textbook – not the most exciting thing in the world, but it does provide insights into and perspectives on the foundation of early horror movies and how many similarities carry over into movies half a century and more later." [...] Michael W. Phillips, Jr. concurs, calling the film [...] "a marked improvement on the original film [...] still a bit of a <b>snooze,</b> relying too much on forced comedy and not enough on suspense or fright." [...] Phillips again praises Holden's performance and also Pichel's portrayal of Sandor, but finds the rest of the cast weak.|$|E
500|$|In a mixed review, Luke McManus of RTÉ {{compared}} its {{songs to}} [...] "those jazzy Beastie Boys tracks", {{and described the}} sound as [...] "undemanding and smooth". However, McManus criticized the album's mood and wrote, [...] "Soporific, over polite and too damn quiet, Soul Food Taqueira veers dangerously close to <b>snooze</b> territory." [...] Bryan Carroll of Allmusic criticized the predominance of [...] "mood pieces", and stated, [...] "on the whole Soul Food Taqueria fails {{to stick to the}} ribs because it simply lacks the proper spice". Other critics cited Guerrero's simple, inventive style and sound for the album as one of its better qualities. Bill Campbell of Ink 19 called the album an [...] "exemplary album ... 100% soul". He also commended Guerrero's musicality, [...] "he constructs heartfelt music with a complexity few can pull off successfully", as well as his guitar playing, as Campbell wrote [...] "his guitar work is subtle and works the spaces between the beats marvelously".|$|E
500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, {{columnist}} Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with an A-, and praised September's stumbling {{entrance into the}} lab as [...] "yet another rich and remarkable scene". Entertainment Weekly writer Jeff Jensen had a more negative opinion, and commented that the episode [...] "failed to make my dinger hum," [...] which he attributed to high expectations set by fellow staff writer and former Fringe reviewer Ken Tucker. Jensen continued, [...] "It was, to my eyes, 'just okay.' Certainly not the equal {{of the past two}} episodes. And not the strongest possible kicker to a strong second act for Fringes fourth season, which now takes a four-week <b>snooze</b> before rising anew on March 23 for the first of eight consecutive episodes– a sweep of story that might represent the very end of all things Fringe. Damn, I’m such a downer this week, aren’t I? Ah, but so was this episode." [...] In January 2013, IGN ranked the episode as the fourth best episode of the series, explaining that [...] "when Season 4 needed a boost of excitement, this episode delivered it in a timely fashion. It had a thrilling pace and offered answers to some questions that have lingering since the series began." ...|$|E

[...] Barry Didcock from Sunday Herald felt that [...] "Morton [...] to find the face of Madonna." [...] He criticized Morton's sketchy portrayal of Madonna's relationship with deceased painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, saying [...] "he commits an error by doing so because, unusually for Madonna, this was a relationship of equals." [...] Gregg Barrios from Daily Star was critical of the book, saying [...] " [...] The fatal flaw of these quickie knockoffs {{is that they have}} no real ending or any way of predicting what the fates have in store for Madonna Louise Penn [...] nee Ciccone. Once the next Madonna tour, CD, marriage or film appears, their shelf life is cut short." [...] Barbara Ellen from The Guardian criticized Morton's writing by saying, [...] "Andrew Morton achieves the implausible: he takes an interesting woman and an astonishing life and makes them both seem incredibly boring in his life of Madonna.... Once you get used to Morton's pace (dull plod, with occasional <b>snooze),</b> it becomes quite amusing joining him on the journey, a bit like watching someone dragging a dead body around, trying to find some place to hide it. Even luminaries such as Madonna exes Sean Penn and Warren Beatty are reduced to flailing around like disenfranchised phantoms in the shallows of Morton's blandly automatic insight." ...|$|E
