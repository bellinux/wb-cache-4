40|$|On October 9, 1999 an {{earthquake}} of ML = 3. 6 occurred about 3 km beneath the central cone of Mt. Vesuvius, near Naples, Italy. The event {{had the highest}} magnitude recorded for at least 25 years, and possibly since the last eruption of this volcano (1944), and was not accompanied by other geophysical or geochemical changes. The present paper essentially deals with the seismological data collected at Mt. Vesuvius for 29 years before the October 9 earthquake {{till the end of}} 2001, and describes the time pattern distribution of seismic slip release and the b-parameter of the Gutenberg^Richter distribution. The self-similarity of the source process is investigated through the scaling law of the <b>seismic</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Results indicate a two-fold pattern of stress release, with high values (up to 100 bar) for earthquakes occurring close {{to the top of the}} carbonate basement that underlies the volcano at 2 ^ 3 km of depth, and low values (down to 0. 1 bar) for the shallow events occurring within the volcanic edifice. The scaling law of the <b>seismic</b> <b>spectrum</b> is non-self-similar, indicating that the source dimensions do not scale with the seismic moment. For this reason the low-magnitude events substantially contribute to the overall cumulative seismic slip release. The bparameter of the Gutenberg^Richter distribution shows a variation around 1980, and a substantial constancy in the other time periods. The presence of extended aquifers, with their tops at about 1 km beneath the crater, favors the hypothesis of the triggering of the shallowest events by water-level changes. This hypothesis is in agreement with the low values of the stress drop measured for the shallowest seismic events. The existence of a carbonate basement with its top at about 2. 5 km beneath the crater and the higher stress drops for the deeper events make reasonable the hypothesis that the pre-fractured carbonate basement may be the site of tectonic stress release...|$|E

Margrave (1998) proposed the Fourier mixed-domain formulation of a non-stationary convolution model when studying the time-variant deconvolution in the frequency domain. In this paper, the deduction of the Laplace mixed-domain formula of the convolution model {{is the first step}} of our method, which is comprised of the Laplace <b>seismic</b> <b>spectrum,</b> the wavelet spectrum and time-domain reflectivity. Furthermore, the Bayesian estimation system is lodged in our inversion process to enhance the stability and resolution of estimated parameters. For the next step, the object function of complex Laplace mixed-domain inversion can be established, accompanied by the linear increment initial model of subsurface parameters with L 2 -norm regularization. Furthermore, the feasibility of complex Laplace mixed-domain inversion and multi-scale strategy is demonstrated by the 1 D synthetic and 2 D overthrust model tests. Finally, one successful field case with the proposed method is displayed, and the results illustrate its great potential for low-frequency recovery and high-resolution estimation.|$|E

40|$|Earthquake {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} natural disasters leading to financial, environmental, and even human losses. The most effective approach to prevent losses induced by structural damage is seismic design for structures, in which the determination of design earthquakes, including <b>seismic</b> design <b>spectra</b> and <b>seismic</b> design ground motions, is of great importance. Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA) has been widely used for the determination and selection of design earthquakes. However, there are a number of issues on the engineering application of PSHA in obtaining the design earthquakes, which need to be addressed before it can be readily implemented into reliability- and performance-based seismic design. In this research, based on the PSHA, the generation of <b>seismic</b> design <b>spectra</b> and spectrum-compatible earthquake groundmotions is studied. The PSHA-based <b>seismic</b> design <b>spectra</b> mainly include Uniform Hazard Spectrum (UHS), predicted spectrum based on Ground-Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs), and Conditional Mean Spectrum considering ε (CMS-ε). These existing design spectra, however, do not or only partially provide probabilistic knowledge about the simultaneous occurrence of spectral accelerations at multiple vibration periods. The lack of such probabilistic knowledge of the design spectra may prevent them from being incorporated into reliability- and performance-based seismic design. The purpose of this study is to bridge the gaps between seismological analyses and engineering applications, i. e., to find suitable representations of design earthquakes from the PSHA. A generalized approach is developed to generate <b>seismic</b> design <b>spectra</b> using both scalar and vector-valued PSHA,which overcomes the deficiencies and preserves certain advantages of the existing PSHA-based <b>seismic</b> design <b>spectra.</b> An approximate approach is also developed to simplify the approach to the generation of <b>seismic</b> design <b>spectra</b> so that they can be easily incorporated into structural design and further performance-based seismic design. On the other hand, spectrum-compatible earthquake ground motions, which are generated by manipulating recorded ground motions, have been widely used for seismic design verification and seismic qualification of structures. The existing spectral matching algorithms in frequency-domain, however, may distort the valuable information contained in recorded earthquake ground motions due to the deficiency of the transformation methodologies on which they are based. To properly preserve the frequency contents and nonstationary characteristics of recorded ground motions, a signal processing method called Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) is used to generate spectrum-compatible earthquake ground motions. In the proposed generation procedures, the strategy of the selection of recorded ground motions is based on the PSHA so that the generated ground motions reflect realistic seismic hazard for the site of interest...|$|R

Many features of seismic radiation can be explained by simple models that serve as elementary canonical problems. Some of these properties are very well known like the fact that at low frequencies, the <b>seismic</b> <b>spectrum</b> is proportional to the seismic moment. At high frequencies, on the other hand, radiation is generated by the motion of the rupture front, in particular stopping phases and geometrical obstacles (barriers). A rupture front moving at constant speed does not produce far-field radiation. For many practical applications, for determining source size and stress drop, for example, it is not necessary to determine geometrical details of the rupture. For such cases, a simple circular crack model is quite sufficient. An improvement on this method is to do dynamic inversion on simple, elliptical-shaped sources and letting the rupture start arbitrarily from a point on the fault. This problem can be solved nowadays with finite differences and a variety of inversion techniques.

40|$|New {{methods of}} {{site-specific}} ground motion prediction {{in the time}} and frequency domains are presented. A large earthquake is simulated as a composite (linear combination) of observed small earthquakes (subevents) assuming Aki-Brune functional models of the source time functions (spectra). Source models incorporate basic scaling relations between source and spectral parameters. Ground motion predictions {{are consistent with the}} entire observed <b>seismic</b> <b>spectrum</b> from the lowest to the highest frequencies. These methods are designed to use all the available empirical Green’s functions (or any subset of observations) at a site. Thus a prediction is not biased by a single record, and different possible source-receiver paths are taken into account. Directivity is accounted for by adjusting the apparent source duration at each site. Our time-series prediction algorithm is based on determination of a non-uniform distribution of rupture times of subevents. By introducing a specific rupture velocity we avoid the major problem of deficiency of predictions around the main event's corner frequency. A novel notion of partial coherence allows us to sum subevents' amplitude spectra directly without using any information on their rupture times and phase histories. Predictions by this spectral method are not Jependent on details of rupture nucleation and propagation, location of asperities and other predominantly phase-affecting factors, responsible for uncertainties in time-domain simulations...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{statistical}} linearization based {{approach is}} proposed to derive effective linear properties (ELPs), namely damping ratio and natural frequency, for bilinear hysteretic oscillators subject to seismic excitations specified by an elastic response/design spectrum. First, an efficient numerical scheme is adopted to derive a power spectrum, satisfying a certain statistical criterion, which {{is compatible with}} the considered <b>seismic</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Next, the thus derived power spectrum is used in conjunction with a frequency domain higher-order statistical linearization formulation to substitute a bilinear hysteretic oscillator by a third order linear system. This is done by minimizing an appropriate error function in the least square sense. Then, this third-order linear system is reduced to a second order linear oscillator characterized by a set of ELPs by enforcing equality of certain response statistics of the two linear systems. The ELPs are utilized to estimate the peak response of the considered hysteretic oscillator in the context of linear response spectrum-based dynamic analysis. In this manner, the need for numerical integration of the nonlinear equation of motion is circumvented. Numerical results pertaining to the European EC 8 elastic response spectrum are presented to demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of the proposed approach. These results are supported by Monte Carlo analyses involving an ensemble of 250 non-stationary artificial EC 8 spectrum compatible accelerograms.

This is achieved in an efficient manner without resorting to numerical integration of the governing nonlinear equations of motion.

This power spectrum is then treated as the excitation spectrum to determine effective damping and stiffness coefficients corresponding to an equivalent linear system (ELS) via a statistical linearization scheme. Further, the obtained coefficients are {{used in conjunction with}} the (linear) design spectrum to estimate the peak response of the original nonlinear systems. The cases of systems with piecewise linear stiffness nonlinearity, along with bilinear hysteretic systems are considered. The seismic severity is specified by the elastic design spectrum prescribed by the European aseismic code provisions (EC 8). Monte Carlo simulations pertaining to an ensemble of nonstationary EC 8 design spectrum compatible accelerograms are conducted to confirm that the average peak response of the nonlinear systems compare reasonably well with that of the ELS, within the known level of accuracy furnished by the statistical linearization method. In this manner, the proposed approach yields ELS which can replace the original nonlinear systems in carrying out computationally efficient analyses in the initial stages of the aseismic design of structures under severe seismic excitations specified in terms of a design spectrum...|$|E
40|$|Long {{and short}} term {{stability}} of the electron beam in the storage ring of the Swiss Light Source (SLS) is achieved by dynamic alignment systems and by fast closed orbit feedback. Quadrupoles, sextupoles and BPMs are rigidly mounted on girders, while the bending magnets are bridging adjacent girders. Positioning of the girders is performed by mover systems based on excenters and encoders. The girder positions are monitored by a hydrostatic leveling system and a digital encoder based horizontal positioning system. Another encoder based system for controlling the BPM positions relative to adjacent quadrupoles is calibrated by beam based alignment. Residual noise of the electron beam has been estimated by investigation of <b>seismic</b> <b>spectra,</b> girder eigen-frequencies, beam amplification factors and capabilities of the fast orbit feedback system. We will describe the systems, summarize the status by September 2001 and show first results. Technical and mathematical details of dynamic alignment are described in references [2] and [3]. The orbit feed-back is described in detail in reference [6]...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFrequency spectra from deep-ocean near-bottom {{acoustic}} measurements obtained contemporaneously with wind, wave, and seismic data are described {{and used to}} determine the correlations among these data and to discuss possible causal relationships. Microseism energy appears to originate in four distinct regions relative to the hydrophone: wind waves above the sensors contribute microseism energy observed on the ocean floor; a fraction of this local wave energy propagates as seismic waves laterally, and provides a spatially integrated contribution to microseisms observed both in the ocean and on land; waves in storms generate microseism energy in deep water that travels as seismic waves to the sensor; and waves reflected from shorelines provide opposing waves that add to the microseism energy. Correlations of local wind speed with acoustic and seismic spectral time series suggest that the local Longuet-Higgins mechanism is visible in the acoustic spectrum from about 0. 4 Hz to 80 Hz. Wind speed and acoustic levels at the hydrophone are poorly correlated below 0. 4 Hz, implying that the microseism energy below 0. 4 Hz is not typically generated by local winds. Correlation of ocean floor acoustic energy with <b>seismic</b> <b>spectra</b> from Oahu and with wave spectra near Oahu imply that wave reflections from Hawaiian coasts, wave interactions in the deep ocean near Hawaii, and storms far from Hawaii contribute energy to the <b>seismic</b> and acoustic <b>spectra</b> below 0. 4 Hz. Wavefield directionality strongly influences the acoustic spectrum at frequencies below about 2 Hz, above which the acoustic levels imply near-isotropic surface wave directionality...|$|R
