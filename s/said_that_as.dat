5|$|In Puerto Rico, Albizu Campos {{used the}} Rhoads scandal {{as part of}} his anti-colonial campaign, {{attracting}} followers to the Nationalist Party. In 1950, longtime Puerto Rican pro-independence activists Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola tried to assassinate President Truman to bring their cause to the world stage. When later interviewed, Collazo <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a young man, in 1932 he heard Albizu Campos speak about the Rhoads letter and decided to devote his life to the Nationalist movement.|$|E
5|$|In a 1988 TV special, series creator Gene Roddenberry <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> {{with the}} first pilot, this one still {{had a lot of}} science-fiction {{elements}} in it, but at least it ended with Kirk in a bare-knuckle fistfight with Mitchell and that's what sold NBC on Star Trek.|$|E
5|$|Cameron {{later told}} a BBC {{documentary}} {{that he had}} not expected to become Prime Minister, and the coalition agreement had not yet been completed when Brown resigned. Speaking on the programme, Five Days That Changed Britain, broadcast on 29 July, he said that when he went to meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace, the coalition deal had not been finalised. Formally, the monarch can only invite a prospective Prime Minister to form a Government; the shape of the Government is for the new Prime Minister to decide. William Hague <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> Cameron travelled to the Palace, the coalition agreement was still being completed and signed.|$|E

Upon terms of reasonable equality, she supposed, that mutual confidence might best subsist; she <b>said,</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> Mr Day had decidedly declared his determination to live in perfect seclusion from what is usually called the world, it was fit she should decidedly declare, {{that she would not}} change her present mode of life, with which she had no reason to be dissatisfied, for any dark and untried system, that could be proposed to her.|$|E
5|$|Petrović {{worked for}} a number of landlords {{throughout}} Šumadija until 1787, when he and his family left the region and settled in the Austrian Empire, fearing persecution {{at the hands of the}} Ottoman janissaries. It is <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> they were preparing to cross the Danube into Austria, Petrović's father began to have second thoughts about leaving Šumadija. Knowing that the entire family would be put in jeopardy if his father stayed behind, Petrović either took his father's life or arranged for someone to kill him instead.|$|E
5|$|Ray {{considered}} {{making a}} {{film on the}} Bangladesh Liberation War but later abandoned the idea. He <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> a filmmaker, he {{was more interested in}} the travails of the refugees and not the politics. In 1977, Ray completed Shatranj Ke Khiladi (The Chess Players), a Hindi film based on a story by Munshi Premchand. It was set in Lucknow in the state of Oudh, a year before the Indian rebellion of 1857. A commentary on issues related to the colonisation of India by the British, this was Ray's first feature film in a language other than Bengali. It is his most expensive and star-studded film, featuring Sanjeev Kumar, Saeed Jaffrey, Amjad Khan, Shabana Azmi, Victor Bannerjee and Richard Attenborough.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{consistently}} highlighted its comedic achievement. Game Informer said it {{is frequently}} hilarious, ranking it among the best comedic games ever released. IGN praised The Stick of Truth for its witty and intelligent satire of the role-playing genre, while others <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> well as being consistently funny, the game was suitably boisterous, shocking, provocative, self-effacing, and fearless in its desire to offend. Many reviewers agreed {{that much of the}} content was more appealing to South Park fans; some jokes are lost on the uninitiated but others said that enough context was provided for most jokes to be funny regardless of players' familiarity with the source material. IGN said that it is the game South Park fans have always wanted, but some reviewers said that without the South Park license, the game's shallowness would be more obvious.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{introduced}} a resolution stating that North Korea's invasion was {{a breach of}} peace in violation of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Gross requested that South Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, Chang Myon, be present for the meeting, which was granted. The Yugoslavian delegate requested that a North Korean diplomat be present as well, but this request was not granted. North Korea was {{not a member of}} the UN and had no representation in the organization. Myon read a prepared statement calling the invasion a crime against humanity, and <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> the UN had played a major role in the founding of South Korea, it was their responsibility to help defend it from aggression. The UNSC debated the resolution and made amendments and revisions to its wording before passing it.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of Kennedy's wounds suggested that his assailant had stood behind him, but some witnesses said that Sirhan faced west as Kennedy {{moved through the}} pantry facing east. This {{has led to the}} suggestion that a second gunman actually fired the fatal shot, a possibility supported by former Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner for the County of Los Angeles Thomas Noguchi who stated that the fatal shot was behind Kennedy's right ear and had been fired at a distance of approximately one inch. Other witnesses, though, <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> Sirhan approached, Kennedy was turning to his left shaking hands, facing north and so exposing his right side.|$|E

5|$|The next day, {{authorities}} {{announced an}} indefinite curfew in Sector G-6 of Islamabad, where Lal Masjid is located. The army received orders to shoot anyone leaving the mosque with weapons. The government offered Rs. 5,000 (equivalent to $50 USDs or £41 GBP), plus a free education, to anyone exiting the mosque unarmed. Women inside the mosque were also offered safe passage to their homes. Successive deadlines were extended, as mosque leaders allowed some students to surrender, requiring security forces to renegotiate extensions. Government authorities announced the first {{deadline for the}} occupants of Lal Masjid to surrender unconditionally as 15:30 Pakistan Standard Time (PST), and it was pushed back to 16:00, 18:00, 19:30 and then 21:30. The government <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> many as 600 armed militants remained inside the mosque.|$|E
5|$|The year 1956 was {{not very}} {{different}} from 1955 for Koufax. Despite the blazing speed of his fastball, Koufax continued to struggle with his control. He saw little work, pitching only 58.7 innings with a 4.91 ERA, 29 walks and 30 strikeouts. When Koufax allowed baserunners, he was rarely permitted to finish the inning. Teammate Joe Pignatano <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> soon as Koufax threw a couple of balls in a row, Alston would signal for a replacement to start warming up in the bullpen. Jackie Robinson, in his final season, clashed with Alston on Koufax's usage. Robinson saw that Koufax was talented and had flashes of brilliance, and objected to Koufax being benched {{for weeks at a}} time.|$|E
5|$|Director Mitsuo Fukuda {{stated that}} {{initially}} {{the story of}} Gundam SEED was written from Kira's point of view. Kira's personality and thought process were derived from what Fukuda considered to be Japanese people's thoughts. He said that his story was about his forced wish to fight, in contrast to Shinn Asuka who was not reluctant to fight in Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. In retrospective, Fukuda emphasized a contrast between both Kira's and Shinn's characters to the point both were the opposite of each other regarding their opinions; Kira's development was easier to script. Fukuda <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> both Kira's and Shinn's characters as were similar, they were easy to voice. An official guidebook to the series made an official count {{of the number of}} times Kira cried in Gundam SEED by the time the book was released. He was said to have cried over ten times, and thus a comical message of support was made towards him.|$|E

5|$|He never {{attended}} {{school and was}} illiterate for some years of his early life. He learned {{to read and write}} reportedly out of curiosity after reading and hearing comic books and stories of Kalimán and Porfirio Cadena, El Ojo del Vidrio on the local radio station. In his autobiography, Moreno González <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a child he believed he had the superhuman ability of speaking telepathically with animals like Kalimán did in the comics. He said {{he wanted to be a}} hero like the comic characters. As a child, he was accustomed to seeing gunmen near his home, and played las guerritas ("war games") for fun. While playing the game, he often pretended to be dead, only to say later on that he had been wounded in the game but that he had managed to survive. At the age of twelve, he moved to Apatzingán and made a living by selling matches, peeling onions, working at a melon field, and throwing out the trash from several booths at a marketplace. As a teenager in the late 1980s, Moreno González migrated illegally to the United States, settling in California, where he eventually began selling marijuana. After some years, he moved to Texas and in 1994 was arrested for drug trafficking charges in McAllen. Nearly a decade later in 2003, the U.S. government charged him with conspiracy to distribute five tons of narcotics and issued an arrest warrant. Moreno González then fled back to Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Saran {{acted in}} two Telugu and two Hindi films, {{including}} Nenunnanu, where {{she played a}} student in classical singing. She had ten 2005 releases, nine of which were Telugu films, the most notable for her being Chatrapathi. There she appeared opposite Prabhas and earned her first nomination for the Filmfare Best Telugu Actress Award. A reviewer for Moviebuzz <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> an action film, Saran's character of the lead's love interest was not well developed {{and that she was}} there primarily for the songs. Meanwhile, she tried to make her comeback in Tamil with Mazhai, a remake of the Telugu film Varsham. Neither the movie nor her performance were received well. Also in 2005, she appeared as one of only three characters in the film Mogudu Pellam O Dongodu, which was about a married couple's first night together, and made a guest appearance in a children's film called Bommalata, which won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu. Saran's only lead role in 2006, excluding three special appearances, was in the Tamil film Thiruvilayadal Arambam.|$|E
5|$|When {{the teams}} reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test, leading English batsman Len Hutton had been dropped. The reason {{was said to}} be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling in the {{previous}} Test, during which he scored 20 and 13. Observers noticed Hutton backing away from the fast bowlers. The English selectors believed such a sight would {{have a negative effect on}} the rest of the sidewhich was not in good batting formas it was a poor example from a key player. According to journalist and retired Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly, Hutton's second innings at Lord's had been the worst of his career and gave the impression he had been scared of the Australian pace attack. The omission generated considerable controversy, and pleased the Australians, who felt Hutton was England's best batsman, and thought he had been treated poorly by the selectors. Former Australian batsman Jack Fingleton pointed out that while Hutton had batted erratically and appeared uncomfortable in the previous Test, he also had a strong track record against the tourists, having made 52 and 64 for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Australia in the lead-up matches, and 94, 76 and 122 retired ill in his last three Test innings during the previous Ashes series of 1946–47. O'Reilly regarded Hutton's omission as punitive and vindictive. He said if Hutton needed to be shielded from the new ball attack, then England should have reshuffled their batting order to place their beleaguered opener down the order. O'Reilly <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> Hutton had a large range of attacking strokes, he was not a stereotypical, defensive opener who was mainly used to wear down the opening bowlers, and could be used in the middle order as an aggressor.|$|E
