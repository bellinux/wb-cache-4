5|$|The {{book was}} {{noted for its}} heft, {{in terms of its}} actual page numbers, {{exhaustive}} research, and dense academic language. The writing does occasionally include illustrative anecdotes and some plain language. Rifkin synthesizes research and material from fields such as literature and the arts, theology, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, political science, psychology, and communication theory. The book was described as sociobiology. The Empathic Civilization was contrasted to the book Crisis Economics by Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm, as reaching different conclusions but being complementary by offering valid alternative futures different from contemporary belief in <b>social</b> <b>progress.</b>|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by Taylor & Francis {{and can be found}} at: [URL] traits and daily self-regulation of health goals, social goals, and perceived stress were examined over 100 days to better understand how traits may influence self-regulation. This study was conducted with a sample of 99 older adults via web-based surveys. Results showed that, as predicted, traits of neuroticism, conscientiousness, and extraversion were significantly related to goal progress: those high in neuroticism made less <b>social</b> goal <b>progress</b> and those high in conscientiousness and extraversion made more health and <b>social</b> goal <b>progress</b> over the 100 day period. On days that were perceived as more stressful older adults made less goal progress overall. Health goal and <b>social</b> goal <b>progress</b> were related, although individuals did not always make progress on both goals simultaneously. Stress interacted with neuroticism and conscientiousness, uncovering relationships between goal progress and stressful days that were not evident when examining just direct effects. This study provides empirical evidence for linkages in the six-foci model of personality that are consistent with the idea that trait structures can shape processes...|$|R
5|$|E.V. Ramasamy toured Malaya for a month, from December 1929 to January 1930, to {{propagate}} the self-respect philosophy. Embarking on his journey from Nagapattinam {{with his wife}} Nagammal and his followers, E.V. Ramasamy was received by 50,000 Tamil Malaysians in Penang. During the same month, he inaugurated the Tamils Conference, convened by the Tamils Reformatory Sangam in Ipoh, {{and then went to}} Singapore. In December 1931 he undertook a tour of Europe, accompanied by S. Ramanathan and Erode Ramu, to personally acquaint himself with their political systems, social movements, way of life, economic and <b>social</b> <b>progress</b> and administration of public bodies. He visited Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Russia, Germany, England, Spain, France and Portugal, staying in Russia for three months. On his return journey he halted at Ceylon and returned to India in November 1932.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, when Unitarist Bernardino Rivadavia {{became the}} {{governor}} of the Buenos Aires province, he held a meeting with representatives from all provinces in Argentina. Facundo was present as {{the governor of}} La Rioja. Rivadavia was soon overthrown, and Manuel Dorrego became the new governor. Sarmiento contends that Dorrego, a Federalist, was interested neither in <b>social</b> <b>progress</b> nor in ending barbaric behaviour in Argentina by improving the level of civilization and education of its rural inhabitants. In the turmoil that characterized Argentine politics at the time, Dorrego was assassinated by Unitarists and Facundo was defeated by Unitarist General José María Paz. Facundo escaped to Buenos Aires and joined the Federalist government of Juan Manuel de Rosas. During the ensuing civil war between the two ideologies, Facundo conquered the provinces of San Luis, Cordoba and Mendoza.|$|E
5|$|The Han dynasty was an age {{of great}} economic, technological, cultural, and <b>social</b> <b>progress</b> in China. Its society was governed by an emperor who shared power with an {{official}} bureaucracy and semi-feudal nobility. Its laws, customs, literature, and education were largely guided by the philosophy and ethical system of Confucianism, yet the influence of Legalism and Daoism (from the previous Zhou dynasty) could still be seen. Members of the scholarly-gentry class who aspired to hold public office were required to receive a Confucian-based education. A new synthetic ideology of Han Confucianism was created when the scholar Dong Zhongshu (179104 BCE) united the Confucian canon allegedly edited by Kongzi, or Confucius (551479 BCE), with cosmological cycles of yin and yang and the Chinese five elements.|$|E

5|$|While some, like Spencer, used analogy {{from natural}} {{selection}} as an argument against government {{intervention in the}} economy to benefit the poor, others, including Alfred Russel Wallace, argued that action was needed to correct social and economic inequities {{to level the playing}} field before natural selection could improve humanity further. Some political commentaries, including Walter Bagehot's Physics and Politics (1872), attempted to extend the idea of natural selection to competition between nations and between human races. Such ideas were incorporated into what was already an ongoing effort by some working in anthropology to provide scientific evidence for the superiority of Caucasians over non white races and justify European imperialism. Historians write that most such political and economic commentators had only a superficial understanding of Darwin's scientific theory, and were as strongly influenced by other concepts about <b>social</b> <b>progress</b> and evolution, such as the Lamarckian ideas of Spencer and Haeckel, as they were by Darwin's work. Darwin objected to his ideas being used to justify military aggression and unethical business practices as he believed morality was part of fitness in humans, and he opposed polygenism, the idea that human races were fundamentally distinct and did not share a recent common ancestry.|$|E

Thus, there was a dramatic decrease in the real GDP growth rate and an alarming and rapid growth of unemployment, a decline in the birth rate, a reduction of the employment, a deterioration in the level of education and training, an alarming increase of poverty, in a word, a "collapse" of all social life components.
