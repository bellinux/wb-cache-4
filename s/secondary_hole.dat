40|$|We {{investigate}} whether a circumbinary gas disc can coalesce a supermassive black hole binary {{system in the}} centre of a galaxy. This {{is known to be}} problematic for a prograde disc. We show that in contrast, interaction with a retrograde circumbinary disc is considerably more effective in shrinking the binary because there are no orbital resonances. The binary directly absorbs negative angular momentum from the circumbinary disc by capturing gas into a disc around the <b>secondary</b> black <b>hole,</b> or discs around both holes if the binary mass ratio is close to unity. In many cases the binary orbit becomes eccentric, shortening the pericentre distance as the eccentricity grows. In all cases the binary coalesces once it has absorbed the angular momentum of a gas mass comparable to that of the <b>secondary</b> black <b>hole.</b> Importantly, this conclusion is unaffected even if the gas inflow rate through the disc is formally super [...] Eddington for either hole. The coalescence timescale is therefore always ∼ M_ 2 /Ṁ, where M_ 2 is the <b>secondary</b> black <b>hole</b> mass and Ṁ the inflow rate through the circumbinary disc. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures.

The <b>secondary</b> black <b>hole,</b> revolving in the direction opposite to the gas, experiences a drag from gas-dynamical friction and from direct accretion of part of it. Using two-dimensional (2 D) hydrodynamical grid simulations we investigate the effect of changing the accretion prescriptions on {{the dynamics of the}} <b>secondary</b> black <b>hole</b> which in turn affect the binary hardening and eccentricity evolution. We find that realistic accretion prescriptions lead to results that differ from those inferred assuming accretion of all the gas within the Roche Lobe of the <b>secondary</b> black <b>hole.</b> Different accretion prescriptions result in different disc's surface densities which alter the black hole's dynamics back. Full 3 D SPH realizations of a number of representative cases, run over a shorter interval of time, validate the general trends observed in the less computationally demanding 2 D simulations. Initially circular black hole binaries increase only slightly their eccentricity which then oscillates around small values (< 0. 1) while they harden. By contrast, initially eccentric binaries become more and more eccentric. A semi-analytical model describing the black hole's dynamics under accretion only explores the late evolution stages of the binary in an otherwise unperturbed retrograde disc to illustrate how eccentricity evolves with time in relation to the shape of the underlying surface density distribution.

40|$|The {{supermassive black}} holes {{originally}} in the nuclei of two merging galaxies will form a binary in the remnant core. The early {{evolution of the}} massive binary is driven by dynamical friction before the binary becomes "hard" and eventually reaches coalescence through gravitational wave emission. We consider the dynamical friction evolution of massive binaries consisting of a <b>secondary</b> <b>hole</b> orbiting inside a stellar cusp dominated by a more massive central black hole. In our treatment we include the frictional force from stars moving faster than the inspiralling object which is neglected in the standard Chandrasekhar's treatment. We show that the binary eccentricity increases if the stellar cusp density profile rises less steeply than ρ∝ r^- 2. In cusps shallower than ρ∝ r^- 1 the frictional timescale can become very long due to the deficit of stars moving slower than the massive body. Although including the fast stars increases the decay rate, low mass-ratio binaries (q≲ 10 ^- 3) in sufficiently massive galaxies have decay timescales longer than one Hubble time. During such minor mergers the <b>secondary</b> <b>hole</b> stalls on an eccentric orbit {{at a distance of}} order one tenth the influence radius of the primary hole (i. e., ≈ 10 - 100 pc for massive ellipticals).

In this work we study the radiative properties of a binary system of supermassive black holes, assuming that a relativistic jet is launched from the primary and the migration of the secondary across the disk proceeds in the "overflowing" regime. The modified radiative spectrum of the disk is calculated accounting for strong gravitational effects in the innermost region. The jet emits non-thermal radiation all along the electromagnetic spectrum by interaction of locally accelerated electrons with the jet's magnetic field and internal and external radiation.

Their photophysical behavior has been investigated by both visible excitation of the ZnP chromophore and UV excitation of the NDI unit. Dyad 3 exhibits relatively inefficient quenching of the ZnP singlet excited state, slow charge separation, and fast charge recombination processes. Excitation of the NDI chromophore, on the other hand, leads to charge separation by both singlet and triplet quenching pathways, with the singlet charge-separated (CS) state recombining in a subnanosecond time scale and the triplet CS state decaying in ca. 90 ns.

40|$|We {{compute the}} effect of an {{orbiting}} gas disc in promoting the coalescence of a central supermassive black hole binary. Unlike earlier studies, we consider a finite mass of gas with explicit time dependence: we do not assume that the gas necessarily adopts a steady state or a spatially constant accretion rate, i. e. that the merging black hole was somehow inserted into a pre [...] existing accretion disc. We consider the tidal torque of the binary on the disc, and the binary's gravitational radiation. We {{study the effects of}} star formation in the gas disc in a simple energy feedback framework. The disc spectrum differs in detail from that found before. In particular, tidal torques from the <b>secondary</b> black <b>hole</b> heat the edges of the gap, creating bright rims around the secondary. These rims do not in practice have uniform brightness either in azimuth or time, but can on average account for as much as 50 per cent of the integrated light from the disc. This may lead to detectable high [...] photon [...] energy variability on the relatively long orbital timescale of the <b>secondary</b> black <b>hole,</b> and thus offer a prospective signature of a coalescing black hole binary. We also find that the disc can drive the binary to merger on a reasonable timescale only if its mass is at least comparable with that of the <b>secondary</b> black <b>hole,</b> and if the initial binary separation is relatively small, i. e. a_ 0 ≲ 0. 05 pc. Star formation complicates the merger further by removing mass from the disc. In the feedback model we consider, this sets an effective limit to the disc mass. As a result, binary merging is unlikely unless the black hole mass ratio is 0. 001. Gas discs thus appear not to be an effective solution to the `last parsec' problem for a significant class of mergers. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figures, MNRAS accepte...|$|R

We track the orbital decay of the light, <b>secondary</b> black <b>hole</b> M • 2 orbiting around the more massive primary {{at the center of}} the disk, using N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the gravitational interaction of M • 2 with massive clumps M cl erratically perturbs the otherwise smooth orbital decay. In close encounters with massive clumps, gravitational slingshots can kick the <b>secondary</b> black <b>hole</b> out of the disk plane. The black hole moving on an inclined orbit then experiences the weaker dynamical friction of the stellar background, resulting in a longer orbital decay timescale. Interactions between clumps can also favor orbital decay when the black hole is captured by a massive clump that is segregating toward the center of the disk. The stochastic behavior of the black hole orbit emerges mainly when the ratio M • 2 /M cl falls below unity, with decay timescales ranging from ~ 1 to ~ 50 Myr.

Therefore, when thermally activated, they gain the required atomic mobility to reduce their free energy associated with surfaces, by transforming to a stable morphology of isolated islands. This phenomenon is called “solid-state dewetting”. Solid-state dewetting of thin films {{is a source of}} failure in microelectronic applications. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we present an in-situ investigation on the integrity of a polycrystalline Pt thin film which was enhanced by applying ZnO as an adhesion layer between the film and the Si substrate. Besides the typical morphological evolution during dewetting of a continuous thin film e. g. hillocking, hole formation, hole growth and formation of isolated islands, we report on two distinct events that were captured in real-time. Sublimation of ZnO and <b>secondary</b> <b>hole</b> formation via break up of blisters of Pt thin film, in this case at ~ 1053 K, and formation of an amorphous platinum silicide phase and Pt 3 Si intermetallic phase in later stages of dewetting. We do however highlight that these observations are for films exposed to high temperatures under high vacuum conditions and caution must be exercised when applying these observations to other systems. Moreover, solid-state dewetting can lead to the formation of complex submicron or nanostructures, depending on the original geometry of the film. In single crystal thin films, due to the structural symmetry and anisotropic surface properties, the ordered assembly of the islands occurs spontaneously during dewetting. There is an increasing interest in controlling the morphology of dewetting structures due to higher demand for the scaled-down devices. The morphological characteristics of these structures are manifested by instabilities that happen simultaneously during dewetting. Precise identification of these instabilities leads to an enhanced inference of the underpinning kinetic mechanisms that govern the formation of complex dewetting morphologies. In the second part of the thesis, we use pre-patterned single crystal Ni film on single crystal MgO substrate as a model system to study the effect of various parameters on final morphology of dewetted structures. More specifically, we investigate the effect of film's edge roughness, the in-plane crystallographic orientation of film patches, annealing temperature and annealing ambient on fingering instability. We also demonstrate that solid-state dewetting can be exploited as a self-assembly method to achieve the desired morphology via introducing a template to the edges of patches of single crystal Ni film.

The photoconductance as a function of incident X-ray energy exhibits an edge both at the Ga and As K-edge, implying that core-hole excitation of Ga and As are efficient primary steps for the excitation of DX centers. A high quantum yield (≫ 1) suggests that the excitation is indirect and nonlocal, due to <b>secondary</b> electrons, <b>holes,</b> and fluorescence photons. Comment: 3 pages of text, 6 figures.

40|$|We {{have studied}} three most recent {{precursor}} flares {{in the light}} curve of the blazar OJ 287 while invoking {{the presence of a}} precessing binary black hole in the system to explain the nature of these flares. Precursor flare timings from the historical light curves are compared with theoretical predictions from our model that incorporate effects of an accretion disk and post-Newtonian description for the binary black hole orbit. We find that the precursor flares coincide with the <b>secondary</b> black <b>hole</b> descending toward the accretion disk of the primary black hole from the observed side, with a mean z-component of approximately z_{c} = 4000 AU. We use this model of precursor flares to predict that precursor flare of similar nature should happen around 2020. 96 before the next major outburst in 2022...|$|R
40|$|The blazar OJ 287 is {{the most}} {{promising}} (and the only) case for an extragalactic binary black hole system inspiralling under the action of gravitational radiation reaction. At present, {{though it is not}} possible to directly observe the binary components, it is possible to observe the jet emanating form the primary black hole. We argue that the orbital motion of the <b>secondary</b> black <b>hole</b> is reflected in the wobble of the jet and demonstrate that the wobble is orbital position dependent. The erratic wobble of the jet, reported in Agudo et al. (2012), is analyzed by taking into account the binary nature of the system and we find that the erratic component of jet wobble is very small.

40|$|Abstract. The quasar 3 C 273 is a {{well-known}} superluminal source. More than 10 radio components have been detected {{moving away from the}} nucleus with different superluminal speeds and position angles. The pattern of ejection suggests the existence of a precessing inner jet, whose kinematics has been discussed by Abraham & Romero (1999). We now present a binary black hole model for the central engine of 3 C 273 where the rapid precession is tidally induced in the primary accretion disk inner region by a <b>secondary</b> black <b>hole</b> in a non-coplanar orbit. Using γ- and X-ray data we estimate upper limits for the mass of the primary, and then we compute the relevant parameters of the system for a variety of disk models. We also discuss some of the implications of the model for the electromagnetic and gravitational radiation from 3 C 273...|$|R

Ballistic <b>secondary</b> electrons and <b>holes,</b> their attenuation and drift, as well as their recombination, trapping, and detrapping are included. Thermal and field-enhanced detrapping are described by the Poole-Frenkel effect. Furthermore, an additional surface layer with a modified electric surface conductivity is included which describes the surface leakage currents and will lead to particular charge incorporation at the interface between the surface layer and the bulk substrate...|$|R

Heavily-armoured areas of battleships would not be vulnerable to 6-inch fire, but there were large areas {{that could not be}} heavily protected. These lightly armoured and unarmoured areas would be [...] "riddled" [...] at the expected ranges of perhaps 3000 yards. This would knock out the enemy's <b>secondary</b> armament, punch <b>holes</b> in the lightly armoured bow and stern, perhaps knock down funnels and spotting tops, and destroy the bridge and command positions.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the X-shaped morphology observed in some radio sources can reflect either a recent merger of two supermassive black holes (SMBHs) or the presence of a second active black hole in the galactic nucleus. These scenarios are tested by studying the relationship between the black hole mass, radio and optical luminosity, starburst history, and dynamic age of radio lobes in a sample of 29 X-shaped radio galaxies drawn from a list of 100 X-shaped radio source candidates identified from the FIRST survey. The same relationships are also studied in a control sample consisting of 36 radio-loud active nuclei with similar redshifts and optical and radio luminosities. The X-shaped objects are found to have statistically higher black hole masses and older starburst activity compared to the objects from the control sample. Implications of these findings are discussed for the black hole merger scenario and for the potential presence of active <b>secondary</b> black <b>holes</b> in post-merger galaxies.
