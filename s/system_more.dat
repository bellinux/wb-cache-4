5|$|According to {{developer}} Matthew Dillon, {{progress is}} being made to provide both device input/output (I/O) and virtual file system (VFS) messaging capabilities that will enable the remainder of the project goals to be met. The new infrastructure will allow many parts of the kernel to be migrated out into userspace; here they will be more easily debugged as they will be smaller, isolated programs, instead of being small parts entwined in a larger chunk of code. Additionally, the migration of select kernel code into userspace has the benefit of making the <b>system</b> <b>more</b> robust; if a userspace driver crashes, it will not crash the kernel.|$|E
5|$|Almost a year later, in August 1981, Voyager 2 {{continued}} {{the study of}} the Saturn <b>system.</b> <b>More</b> close-up images of Saturn's moons were acquired, as well as evidence of changes in the atmosphere and the rings. Unfortunately, during the flyby, the probe's turnable camera platform stuck {{for a couple of days}} and some planned imaging was lost. Saturn's gravity was used to direct the spacecraft's trajectory towards Uranus.|$|E
5|$|On October 15, 1976, an {{arsonist}} lit a fire on {{a subway}} train at Christie station. The fire destroyed four subway cars and some wall tiles, and resulted in {{a section of the}} subway being closed for a few days. On September 19, 2007, the station modernization program was started. This program would result in making the subway <b>system</b> <b>more</b> accessible, add new bus and streetcar platforms, and improve the connections to regional buses and GO trains.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to previous installments, focusing on combo-based combat with the player's main weapon—the Blades of Exile—and secondary weapons acquired during the game. It uses quick time events, where the player acts in a timed sequence to defeat strong enemies and bosses. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options, and the game features puzzles and platforming elements. Compared with previous installments, God of War III offers a revamped magic <b>system,</b> <b>more</b> onscreen enemies, new camera angles, and downloadable content.|$|E
5|$|The sinkhole's {{collapse}} in Guatemala City's Zona 2 left at least 15 dead, and a further 300 residents' lives were put at risk.

5|$|A {{number of}} health and medical {{research}} advocates, such as the Society for Women's Health Research in the United States, support this broader definition, rather than merely issues specific to human female anatomy to include areas where biological sex differences {{between women and men}} exist. Women also need health care more and access the health care <b>system</b> <b>more</b> than do men. While part of this is due to their reproductive and sexual health needs, they also have more chronic non-reproductive health issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and osteoporosis. Another important perspective is realising that events across the entire life cycle (or life-course), from in utero to aging effect the growth, development and health of women. The life-course perspective {{is one of the key}} strategies of the World Health Organization.|$|E

5|$|The South financed a {{much lower}} {{proportion}} of its expenditures through direct taxes than the North. The share of direct taxes in total revenue for the North was about 20%, while for the South the same share was only about 8%. A {{major part of the}} reason why tax revenue did not play as large a role for the Confederacy was the individual states' opposition to a strong central government and the belief in states' rights which precluded giving too much taxing power to the government in Richmond. Another factor for not extending the tax <b>system</b> <b>more</b> broadly was the belief, present in both the North and the South, that the war would be of limited duration, and hence there was no compelling reason to increase the tax burden.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the Jovian rings was inferred from observations of the planetary radiation belts by Pioneer 11 spacecraft in 1975. In 1979 the Voyager 1 spacecraft obtained a single overexposed image of the ring <b>system.</b> <b>More</b> extensive imaging was conducted by Voyager 2 in the same year, which allowed rough determination of the ring’s structure. The superior quality of the images obtained by the Galileo orbiter between 1995 and 2003 greatly extended the existing knowledge about the Jovian rings. Ground-based observation of the rings by the Keck telescope in 1997 and 2002 and the HST in 1999 revealed the rich structure visible in back-scattered light. Images transmitted by the New Horizons spacecraft in February–March 2007 allowed observation of the fine structure in the main ring for the first time. In 2000, the Cassini spacecraft en route to Saturn conducted extensive observations of the Jovian ring system. Future missions to the Jovian system will provide additional information about the rings.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in Morningside Heights on Seth Low's late-19th century {{vision of a}} university campus where all disciplines could be taught at one location. The campus was designed along Beaux-Arts principles by architects McKim, Mead, and White. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six city blocks, or , in Morningside Heights, New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive underground tunnel <b>system</b> <b>more</b> than a century old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus. Some of these remain accessible to the public, while others have been cordoned off.|$|E

5|$|Formerly {{known as}} AH-64D Block III, in 2012, it was redesignated as AH-64E Guardian to {{represent}} its increased capabilities. The AH-64E features improved digital connectivity, the Joint Tactical Information Distribution <b>System,</b> <b>more</b> powerful T700-GE-701D engines with upgraded face gear transmission to accommodate more power, capability to control {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAVs), full IFR capability, and improved landing gear. New composite rotor blades, which successfully completed testing in 2004, increase cruise speed, climb rate, and payload capacity. Deliveries began in November 2011. Full-rate production was approved on 24 October 2012, with 634 AH-64Ds to be upgraded to AH-64E standard and production of 56 new-build AH-64Es to start in 2019/20. Changes in production lots 4 through 6 shall include a cognitive decision aiding system and new self-diagnostic abilities. The updated Longbow radar has an oversea capacity, potentially enabling naval strikes; an AESA radar is under consideration. The E model is to be fit for maritime operations. The Army has {{expressed a desire to}} add extended-range fuel tanks to the AH-64E to further increase range and endurance. AH-64Es are to have the L-3 Communications MUM-TX datalink installed in place of two previous counterparts, communicating on C, D, L, and Ku frequency bands to transmit and receive data and video with all Army UAVs. Lots 5 and 6 will be equipped with Link 16 data-links.|$|E
