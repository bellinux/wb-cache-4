The {{present study was}} conducted among 159 unmarried adolescents (80 athletes and 79 non-athletes) of age 15 to 19 years. The study participants belong to Bengali speaking Hindu ethnic group of Kolkata, {{the capital city of}} West Bengal State of India. Data were collected on socio-demographic and menstrual characteristics using pre-tested questionnaires. Anthropometric measurements were taken following standard methods. Descriptive statistics were used to understand the differences in menstrual characteristics between athletes and non-athletes, stepwise linear regression analyses were carried out to predict age at menarche, menstrual cycle length and duration of menstrual discharge using socio-demographic and anthropometric variables as well as athletic status as independent variables. Logistic (binary) regression was carried out to assess the strength of association between menstrual characteristics (as dependent variables) and athletic status, socio-demographic and anthropometric variables, and other menstrual characteristics (independent variables). The study participants differ significantly (p≤ 0. 05) for certain menstrual characteristics such as age at menarche, cycle length, <b>skipped</b> <b>cycle,</b> premenstrual syndrome, heavy discharge when compared for their athletic status. Certain anthropometric and socioeconomic variables were found to be significantly associated with their menstrual characteristics. The study results demonstrate that menstrual functioning among adolescents is significantly influenced by their athletic status.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The fragile X {{premutation}} {{is characterized}} by a large CGG repeat track (55 – 199 repeats) in the 50 UTR of the FMR 1 gene. This X-linked mutation leads to an increased risk for premature ovarian failure; interestingly, the association of repeat size with risk is non-linear. We hypothesize that the premutation-associated ovarian insuffi-ciency is due to a diminished oocyte pool and examined reproductive aging milestones by repeat size group to deter-mine if the same non-linear association is observed. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional reproductive history questionnaire data from 948 women {{with a wide range of}} repeat sizes. RESULTS: We have confirmed the non-linear relationship among premutation carriers for ovarian insufficiency. The mid-range repeat size group (80 – 100 repeats), not the highest group, had an increased risk for: altered cycle traits (shortened cycle length, irregular <b>cycles</b> and <b>skipped</b> <b>cycles),</b> subfertility and dizygotic twinning. Smoking, a modifiable risk, decreased the reproductive lifespan of women with the premutation by about 1 year, similar to its effect on non-carriers. As expected, premutation carriers were found to be at an increased risk for osteoporosis.

Doppler coefficient has been computed by calculating the eigen values of some selected idealized PWR fuel pin cell configurations with seven different fuel enrichments of UO 2.

40|$|A custom {{laboratory}} {{electronic timer}} circuit measures the durations of successive cycles of nominally highly stable input clock signals {{in as many}} as eight channels, for the purpose of statistically quantifying the small instabilities of these signals. The measurement data generated by this timer are sent to a personal computer running software that integrates the measurements to form a phase residual for each channel and uses the phase residuals to compute Allan variances for each channel. (The Allan variance is a standard statistical measure of instability of a clock signal.) Like other laboratory clock-cycle-measuring circuits, this timer utilizes an externally generated reference clock signal having a known frequency (100 MHz) much higher than the frequencies of the input clock signals (between 100 and 120 Hz). It counts the number of reference-clock cycles that occur between successive rising edges of each input clock signal of interest, thereby affording a measurement of the input clock-signal period to within the duration (10 ns) of one reference clock cycle. Unlike typical prior laboratory clock-cycle-measuring circuits, this timer does not <b>skip</b> some <b>cycles</b> of the input clock signals. The non-cycle-skipping feature is an important advantage because in applications that involve integration of measurements over long times for characterizing nominally highly stable clock signals, <b>skipping</b> <b>cycles</b> can degrade accuracy. The timer includes a field-programmable gate array that functions as a 20 -bit counter running at the reference clock rate of 100 MHz. The timer also includes eight 20 -bit latching circuits - one for each channel - at the output terminals of the counter. Each transition of an input signal from low to high causes the corresponding latching circuit to latch the count at that instant. Each such transition also sets a status flip-flop circuit to indicate the presence of the latched count. A microcontroller reads the values of all eight status flipflops and then reads the latched count for each channel for which the flip-flop indicates the presence of a count. Reading the count for each channel automatically causes the flipflop of that channel to be reset. The microcontroller places the counts in time order, identifies the channel number for each count, and transmits these data to the personal computer...|$|R

In our previous work, we proposed the quadratic Wasserstein metric (W_ 2) as a new misfit function for FWI. The W_ 2 metric has been proved to have many ideal properties with regards to convexity and insensitivity to noise. When the observed and predicted seismic data are regarded as two density functions, the quadratic Wasserstein metric corresponds to the optimal cost of rearranging one density into the other, where the transportation cost is quadratic in distance. The difficulty of transforming seismic signals into nonnegative density functions is discussed. Unlike the L^ 2 norm, W_ 2 measures not only amplitude differences, but also global phase shifts, which helps to avoid <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping</b> issues. In this work, we build on our earlier method to cover more realistic high-resolution applications by embedding the W_ 2 technique into the framework of the adjoint-state method and applying it to seismic relevant 2 D examples: the Camembert, the Marmousi, and the 2004 BP models. We propose a new way of using the W_ 2 metric trace-by-trace in FWI and compare it to global W_ 2 via the solution of the Monge-Ampère equation. With corresponding adjoint source, the velocity model can be updated using the l-BFGS method. Numerical results show the effectiveness of W_ 2 for alleviating <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping</b> issues and sensitivity to noise.

40|$|International audienceFull {{waveform}} inversion {{using the}} conventional L 2 distance {{to measure the}} misfit between seismograms is known to suffer from <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping.</b> An alternative strategy is proposed in this study, based on {{a measure of the}} misfit computed with an optimal transport distance. This measure allows to account for the lateral coherency of events within the seismograms, instead of considering each seismic trace independently, as is done generally in full waveform inversion. The computation of this optimal transport distance relies on a particular mathematical formulation allowing for the non-conservation of the total energy between seismograms. The numerical solution of the optimal transport problem is performed using proximal splitting techniques. Three synthetic case studies are investigated using this strategy: the Marmousi 2 model, the BP 2004 salt model, and the Chevron 2014 benchmark data. The results emphasize interesting properties of the optimal transport distance. The associated misfit function is less prone to <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping.</b> A workflow is designed to reconstruct accurately the salt structures in the BP 2004 model, starting from an initial model containing no information about these structures. A high-resolution P-wave velocity estimation is built from the Chevron 2014 benchmark data, following a frequency continuation strategy. This estimation explains accurately the data. Using the same workflow, full waveform inversion based on the L 2 distance converges towards a local minimum. These results yield encouraging perspectives regarding the use of the optimal transport distance for full waveform inversion: the sensitivity to the accuracy of the initial model is reduced, the reconstruction of complex salt structure is made possible, the method is robust to noise, and the interpretation of seismic data dominated by reflections is enhanced...|$|R
40|$|Conventional full-waveform seismic {{inversion}} {{attempts to}} find {{a model of the}} subsurface that is able to predict observed seismic waveforms exactly; it proceeds by minimizing the difference between the observed and predicted data directly, iterating in a series of linearized steps from an assumed starting model. If this starting model is too far removed from the true model, then this approach leads to a spurious model in which the predicted data are <b>cycle</b> <b>skipped</b> with respect to the observed data. Adaptive waveform inversion (AWI) provides a new form of full-waveform inversion (FWI) that appears to be immune to the problems otherwise generated by <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping.</b> In this method, least-squares convolutional filters are designed that transform the predicted data into the observed data. The inversion problem is formulated such that the subsurface model is iteratively updated to force these Wiener filters toward zero-lag delta functions. As that is achieved, the predicted data evolve toward the observed data and the assumed model evolves toward the true model. This new method is able to invert synthetic data successfully, beginning from starting models and under conditions for which conventional FWI fails entirely. AWI has a similar computational cost to conventional FWI per iteration, and it appears to converge at a similar rate. The principal advantages of this new method are that it allows waveform inversion to begin from less-accurate starting models, does not require the presence of low frequencies in the field data, and appears to provide a better balance between the influence of refracted and reflected arrivals upon the final-velocity model.

40|$|Least-squares {{inversion}} of seismic arrivals can provide remarkably detailed {{models of the}} Earth's subsurface. However, <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping</b> associated with these oscillatory arrivals is the main cause for local minima in the least-squares objective function. Therefore, {{it is often difficult}} for descent methods to converge to the solution without an accurate initial large-scale velocity estimate. The low frequencies in the arrivals, needed to update the large-scale components in the velocity model, are usually unreliable or absent. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a multi-objective inversion scheme that uses the conventional least-squares functional along with an auxiliary data-domain objective. As the auxiliary objective effectively replaces the seismic arrivals by bumps, we call it the bump functional. The bump functional minimization can be made far less sensitive to <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping</b> and can deal with multiple arrivals in the data. However, it can only be used as an auxiliary objective since it usually does not provide a unique model after minimization even when the regularized-least-squares functional has a unique global minimum and hence a unique solution. The role of the bump functional during the multi-objective inversion is to guide the optimization towards the global minimum by pulling the trapped solution out of the local minima associated with the least-squares functional whenever necessary. The computational complexity of the bump functional is equivalent to that of the least-squares functional. In this paper, we describe various characteristics of the bump functional using simple and illustrative numerical examples. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-objective inversion scheme by considering more realistic examples.

40|$|We {{present the}} theory for wave {{equation}} inversion of dispersion curves, where the misfit function {{is the sum}} of the squared differences between the wavenumbers along the predicted and observed dispersion curves. Similar to wave-equation travel-time inversion, the complicated surface-wave arrivals in traces are skeletonized as simpler data, namely the picked dispersion curves in the (kx,ω) domain. Solutions to the elastic wave equation and an iterative optimization method are then used to invert these curves for 2 D or 3 D velocity models. This procedure, denoted as wave equation dispersion inversion (WD), does not require the assumption of a layered model and is less prone to the <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping</b> problems of full waveform inversion (FWI). The synthetic and field data examples demonstrate that WD can accurately reconstruct the S-wave velocity distribution in laterally heterogeneous media...|$|R
30|$|One {{important}} component of back-projection analysis is the station-specific correction (Ishii et al., 2005) that accounts for wavefront distortion due to lateral variations and station error (e.g., timing issue). If this correction is not properly determined, spurious features can be introduced. Because of the narrow frequency filter used {{and complexity of the}} initial few seconds of P waveform, <b>cycle</b> <b>skips</b> are commonly observed with the cross correlation procedure for the Mw 9.0 mainshock. Instead of relying upon such questionable alignment, we utilize waveforms of the Mw 7.1 aftershock from April 7, 2011. This earthquake has clean first arrival, and can be easily cross correlated and aligned. Consequently, all results presented in this paper are with respect to the hypocentral location of this aftershock, i.e., 38.253 °N 141.640 °E and 49.0 -km depth as provided by the National Earthquake Information Centre (NEIC).|$|R
