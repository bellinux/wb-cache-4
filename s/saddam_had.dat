25|$|Saddam pushed oil-exporting {{countries}} to raise oil prices by cutting back production; Kuwait refused, however. In addition to refusing the request, Kuwait spearheaded the opposition in OPEC to the cuts that <b>Saddam</b> <b>had</b> requested. Kuwait was pumping {{large amounts of}} oil, and thus keeping prices low, when Iraq needed to sell high-priced oil from its wells to pay off a huge debt.|$|E

Following the civil war, the Sunnis have complained of supposed discrimination by Iraq's Shia majority government, which is bolstered by the news that Sunni detainees were allegedly discovered to have been tortured in a compound used by government forces on November 15, 2005. This sectarianism has fueled a giant level of emigration and internal displacement.|$|R
25|$|Nearly {{from its}} {{founding}} {{as a modern}} state in 1920, Iraq has {{had to deal with}} Kurdish separatists {{in the northern part of}} the country. Saddam did negotiate an agreement in 1970 with separatist Kurdish leaders, giving them autonomy, but the agreement broke down. The result was brutal fighting between the government and Kurdish groups and even Iraqi bombing of Kurdish villages in Iran, which caused Iraqi relations with Iran to deteriorate. However, after <b>Saddam</b> <b>had</b> negotiated the 1975 treaty with Iran, the Shah withdrew support for the Kurds, who suffered a total defeat.|$|E
25|$|The Iraqi {{government}} and military collapsed within {{three weeks of}} the beginning of the U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq on 20 March. By the beginning of April, U.S.-led forces occupied much of Iraq. The resistance of the much-weakened Iraqi Army either crumbled or shifted to guerrilla tactics, and it appeared that <b>Saddam</b> <b>had</b> lost control of Iraq. He was last seen in a video which purported to show him in the Baghdad suburbs surrounded by supporters. When Baghdad fell to U.S.-led forces on 9 April, marked symbolically by the toppling of his statue by iconoclasts, Saddam was nowhere to be found.|$|E
25|$|After 1996, 13% of the Iraqi oil {{sales were}} {{allocated}} for Iraqi Kurdistan and {{this led to}} a relative prosperity in the region. <b>Saddam</b> <b>had</b> established an oil smuggling route through territory controlled by the KDP, with the active involvement of senior Barzani family members. The taxation of this trade at the crossing point between Saddam’s territory and Kurdish controlled territory and then into Turkey, along with associated service revenue, meant that whoever controlled Dohuk and Zakho had the potential to earn several million dollars a week. Direct United States mediation led the two parties to a formal ceasefire in what was termed the Washington Agreement in September 1998. It is also argued that the Oil-for-Food Programme from 1997 onward had an important effect on cessation of hostilities.|$|E

25|$|The next day, another brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division {{attacked}} into downtown Baghdad {{and occupied}} {{one of the}} palaces of Saddam Hussein in fierce fighting. U.S. Marines also faced heavy shelling from Iraqi artillery as they attempted to cross a river bridge, but the river crossing was successful. The Iraqis managed to inflict some casualties on the U.S. forces near the airport from defensive positions but suffered severe casualties from air bombardment. Within hours of the palace seizure and with television coverage of this spreading through Iraq, U.S. forces ordered Iraqi forces within Baghdad to surrender, or the city would face a full-scale assault. Iraqi government officials had either disappeared or had conceded defeat, and on 9 April 2003, Baghdad was formally occupied by Coalition forces. Much of Baghdad remained unsecured however, and fighting continued within {{the city and its}} outskirts well into the period of occupation. <b>Saddam</b> <b>had</b> vanished, and his whereabouts were unknown.|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Hitchens criticizes Moore for stating, in his film, that Iraq had {{not killed}} or {{attacked}} an American: [...] "Moore asserts that Iraq under <b>Saddam</b> <b>had</b> never attacked or killed or even threatened (his words) any American. I never quite know whether Moore is as ignorant as he looks, {{or even if}} that would be humanly possible." [...] Hitchens writes that Palestinian terrorists Muhammad Zaidan and Abu Nidal had been free to {{move in and out}} of Baghdad, and that Saddam's armed forces had exchanged fire and killed American soldiers during the first Gulf War. When interviewed by Jake Tapper, Moore denied having said Hussein's regime had not ever killed an American, insisting his movie had been misquoted: [...] "That isn't what I said. Quote the movie directly. Murdered. The government of Iraq did not commit a premeditated murder on an American citizen." [...] His narration is reproduced verbatim in The Official Fahrenheit Reader, including a chapter on critiques and supporting evidence.|$|E
2500|$|Testifying {{before the}} Iraq Inquiry on 29 January 2010, Blair said Saddam was a [...] "monster and I believe he {{threatened}} {{not just the}} region but the world." [...] Blair said that British and American attitude towards Saddam Hussein had [...] "changed dramatically" [...] after the 11 September attacks. Blair denied {{that he would have}} supported the invasion of Iraq even if he had thought <b>Saddam</b> <b>had</b> no weapons of mass destruction. He said he believed the world was safer {{as a result of the}} invasion. He said there was [...] "no real difference between wanting regime change and wanting Iraq to disarm: regime change was US policy because Iraq was in breach of its UN obligations." [...] In an October 2015 CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria, Blair apologised for his [...] "mistakes" [...] over Iraq War and admitted there were [...] "elements of truth" [...] to the view that the invasion helped promote the rise of ISIS. The Chilcot Inquiry report of 2016 gave a damning assessment of Blair's role in the Iraq War, though the former prime minister again refused to apologise for his decision to back the US-led invasion.|$|E
5000|$|Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of Iran {{said that}} [...] "The {{execution}} of <b>Saddam</b> <b>has</b> proven that trusting the United States is not convenient," [...] {{referring to the}} Iran-Iraq War in 1980-88 during which, he alleged, Washington encouraged Saddam in {{going to war with}} Tehran but then ousted him from power in 2003 [...] "when he wasn't useful anymore. Countries in the region should learn the lesson and, like Iran, should only trust the will of their people and not corrupt powers." ...|$|R
25|$|The United States, {{which had}} urged Iraqis {{to rise up}} against Saddam, did nothing to assist the rebellions. The Iranians, despite the {{widespread}} Shi'ite rebellions, {{had no interest in}} provoking another war, while Turkey opposed any prospect of Kurdish independence, and the Saudis and other conservative Arab states feared an Iran-style Shi'ite revolution. <b>Saddam,</b> <b>having</b> survived the immediate crisis in the wake of defeat, was left firmly in control of Iraq, although the country never recovered either economically or militarily from the Gulf War.|$|R

2500|$|On 5 November 2006, Saddam Hussein {{was sentenced}} to death by hanging for the killing of 148 Shiites from Dujail, in {{retaliation}} for the assassination attempt of 8 July 1982. [...] When the judge announced the verdict, Saddam shouted, [...] "Long live the people. Long live the Arab nation. Down with the spies. God is great." [...] Chief defense lawyer Khalil al-Dulaimi later quoted a statement from Saddam Hussein given just before the Court issued its verdict. He said that Saddam urged his countrymen to [...] "unify in the face of sectarian strife". Al-Dulaimi added that Saddam's message to the people was to [...] "pardon and do not take revenge on the invading nations, its civilians". An appeal, mandated by the Iraqi judicial system, followed. [...] There was speculation that the appeals could last years, postponing his actual execution. However, on 26 December, Saddam's appeal was rejected and the death sentence was given. No further appeals were possible and <b>Saddam</b> <b>had</b> to be executed within 30 days of that date. The decision still had to be ratified by the Iraqi President but could not be commuted. Judge Arif Shaheen, one of the nine appeal judges, said, [...] "It cannot exceed 30 days. As from tomorrow the sentence could be carried out at any time. The appeals court has issued its verdict. What we have decided today is compulsory." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tatchell {{opposed the}} war in Iraq, and its {{subsequent}} occupation. For nearly three decades he had previously supported the Iraqi Left Opposition, helping them remove the government of Saddam Hussein because of the gross {{violations of human rights}} <b>Saddam</b> <b>had</b> committed against democrats, left-wingers, trade unionists, Shia Muslims and the Kurdish people, and because under Saddam's dictatorship there were no opportunities for peaceful, democratic change. He advocated military and financial aid to opponents of the Saddam government, suggesting that anti-Saddam organisations be given [...] "tanks, helicopter gun-ships, fighter planes, heavy artillery and anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles". While opposing western intervention, he advocated regime change from within in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Syria." [...] Tatchell has written that on 12 March 2003 he ambushed Tony Blair's motorcade in an anti-Iraq war protest. He forced Blair's limousine to stop, and then unfolded a banner that read [...] "Arm the Kurds! Topple Saddam". He added that in terms of the political struggle within Britain (as opposed to struggles against absolute tyrants like Hitler and Saddam, where violent resistance can be the lesser of two evils): [...] "I remain committed to the Gandhian principle of non-violence". After the war he signed the 'Unite Against Terror' declaration, arguing that [...] "the pseudo-left reveals its shameless hypocrisy and its wholesale abandonment of humanitarian values" [...] by supporting resistance and insurgent groups in Iraq that resort to indiscriminate terrorism, killing innocent civilians.|$|E
2500|$|On April 9, the Defense Intelligence Agency {{received}} {{information from}} a source considered reliable, predicting that [...] "the situation is presently more critical than previously reported" [...] and postulating a 50% chance Iraq would invade Iran. An April 11 CIA analysis is more blunt: [...] "Evidence indicates that Iraq had probably planned to initiate a major military move against Iran {{with the aim of}} toppling the Khomeini regime"—and had [...] "sought to engage the Kuwaitis to act as intermediary in obtaining United States approval and support for Iraqi military action against Iran." [...] Carter himself has confirmed that fear the U.S. hostages would be executed if Iraq attacked was one reason he approved a failed rescue mission on April 24. In light of these alerts, the claims of senior Carter administration officials involved with Iran—including White, Naas, Precht, and head of the National Security Council (NSC)'s Iran desk Gary Sick—that they were surprised by the invasion require some explanation. In all likelihood, these warnings went unheeded because [...] "those who doubted they amounted to compelling evidence won the argument. In effect, they were right. Only in early July did U.S. observers note the movement of Iraqi assets out of garrison with war-related 'basic loads' of ammunition" [...] and it was not until September 17 that the CIA indicated [...] "the intensification of border clashes between Iran and Iraq has reached a point where a serious conflict is now a distinct possibility." [...] Even then, as recounted by State Department official W. Nathaniel Howell, U.S. officials remained unsure what to make of Saddam's intentions: [...] "We all followed Saddam's actions and rhetoric closely but most people I knew tended to believe he was posturing." [...] When the invasion came on September 22, [...] "it was unclear whether <b>Saddam</b> <b>had</b> simply fallen into a rage following a smaller skirmish." [...] White recalled: [...] "The outbreak of war did, in fact, {{come as a surprise to}} most of us because a decent portion of Iraq's ground forces were still in garrison. The hasty movement of the remaining units up to the front immediately after the beginning of major hostilities was the activity that tended to nudge me toward the abrupt scenario in which Saddam ordered the attack before all military preparations had been completed." [...] Thus, in the view of Chris Emery, [...] "it is unlikely that the United States was ever in possession of clear evidence of Saddam's intention to invade Iran. Although the Carter administration drastically underestimated the scale of Saddam's plans, the disorganized and apparently impetuous nature of the invasion, with much of the Iraqi army still in garrison, and occurring in the context of border skirmishes and aggressive propaganda, muddied the waters for U.S. observers." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{execution}} also prevented {{trials for}} other cases, including the chemical weapons attacks on Halabja in 1988.

At {{the time of his}} execution, Saddam was on trial, facing charges of genocide at Anfal, which resulted in an estimated 180,000 deaths. [...] "Of course, <b>Saddam</b> <b>has</b> committed too many crimes. He deserves for those crimes capital punishment. But so quickly done, so quickly executed ... and only in one case—it would leave the other cases and leave a lot of secrets without being known", said an Iraqi Kurdish politician, Mahmoud Osman.|$|R
