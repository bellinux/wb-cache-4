Ever increasing salinity negatively affects processes such as plant growth and development, ultimately causing diminished economic yield and quality of production, and it might cause a worldwide famine in the future. Thus, helping plants adapt to saline soils and increasing their yield and quality is a must. Our study focused on the enhancing role of exogenously applied folic acid (FA) in mitigation of toxicity caused by salt (NaCl). Barley seeds were pre-treated with 50 µ M FA for 24 h and then exposed to salt. Morphological and anatomical changes in seed germination and seedling growth stages were compared between different treatments of salt in laboratory conditions. Adverse effects of salt in both germination and seedling growth stages depended on the concentration of salt treatment (0. 0, 0. 25, 0. 275, 0. 30, 0. 325 and 0. 35 M). It was shown that the application of FA effectively alleviated the salt-induced inhibition, and reduced the negative effects of salt on germination (germination index and vigour index), seedling growth (radicle and coleoptile lengths, fresh weight) and leaf (stomata and epidermis number, stomatal index, <b>stomata</b> <b>sizes</b> of adaxial and abaxial surfaces) parameters. Moreover, FA elevated all examined parameters of barley also under non-stress conditions. Especially, germination and vigour indices were significantly higher than the control.

40|$|Relative {{water content}} (r. w. c.) is {{an index of}} dehidration avoidance. If the r. w. c. of one plant remains {{essentially}} constant during anought {{and that of the}} second plant rises markedly, this usually reveals a greater drought avoidance in the former (Levitt 1972.) Nothwithstanding an abundant supply of soil with moisture, daily wather deficit might occur in plant, associated with low relative humidity of air, great solar radiation and wind. Due to intensive transpriration, quantity of wather disimissed from plant in such a case would surpass the water quantity absorbed from the soil (Aston 1970). Thus, speed of giving off water vapour to atmospher will depend upon leaf anatomy, and speed of compensating water loss will,the dependent upon root absorbing capacity. In the present work varietal differences are considered, - in the r. w. c. of wheat flag leaf and in some characters of leaf anatomy (total number of leaf stomata, frequency of <b>stomata,</b> and <b>size</b> of stomatal pore) - as well as the relationship between the r. w. c. and the characters of leaf, anatomy studied. At field conditions, near Zagreb, one year experiment was concrueted, using 10 genotypes of winter wheat, divergent for characters of leaf anatomy, and {{selected on the basis of}} previous studies (Jošt et al. 1972). The r. w. c. of flag leaf was determined at two different weather situations and results,are diagrammed in Fig. 1. Difference (D) in the r. w. c. varied from 0, 70 - 4, 25 %, depending on variety (Tab. 1). The greatest difference was displayed by the branched wheat line Ramifere aristatum 86 / 68 and it follows that this line has the smallest ability for avoiding dehydration. Characteristics of leaf anatomy (total number of flag leaf stomata, frequency of <b>stomata,</b> and <b>size</b> of stomatal pore) for the varieties tested are presented in Tab. 1. It can be seen that the line of branched wheat mentioned, exceeded others in the total number of leaf <b>stomata,</b> and large <b>size</b> of its stomatal poresis recorded, too. From the correlations calculated (Table 2) it is evident that plant ability for avoiding dehidration is affected by all the anatomy studied (multiple correlation coefficient R = 0. 81) i. e. by the total number of leaf stomata in the first place, then by pore size while stomatal frequency has the smallest effect on dehydration avoidance(linear and partial correlation coefficients) ...|$|R

Seventeen tomato genotypes were screened for petiole, leaf anatomy and stomatal features to understand the secret of drought resistance. Total petiole thickness, compact parenchyma and more width of phloem vessels, more number of xylem vessels were important characters of resistant genotypes. Leaves of resistant type had longer palisade mesophyll cells with compact arrangement, thin spongy mesophyll layer leading to higher tissue ratio (Palisade mesophyll: Spongy mesophyll). Thickness of leaves was invariably more in drought resistant genotypes (500 - 550 μm) as compared to susceptible ones (400 - 450 μm). Remarkably reduced number of <b>stomata,</b> bigger <b>size</b> and more distance between them was highlighting character of drought resistant genotypes as compared to abundant, smaller size and closely spaced stomata in susceptible genotypes. We introduce here a new parameter “Leaf Strength Index” which is simple to study and cost effective.

Both plant species were subjected to three different light quality regimes: RGB (Red 33 %, Green 33 %, Blue 33 %) and RB (Red 66 %, Blue 33 %), provided by light emitting diodes (LED); and white light (WL), considered as a control and provided by white fluorescent lamps. Compared to WL, RGB and RB reduced plant height, plant biomass and leaf area. The CO 2 assimilation rate (A) was lower in tomato grown under WL than RGB and RB, while A was similar in oriental plane leaves exposed to the three light regimes. In tomato, stomatal (gs) and mesophyll (gm) conductance were higher under RGB and RB compared to WL. In plane, gs was also higher under RGB and RB, while gm was not significantly influenced by different light qualities. In both species, leaf lamina thickness (LT) and <b>stomata</b> <b>size</b> were the anatomical traits most affected by the different light regimes. In tomato, LT was significantly reduced in RGB and RB leaves, whereas in oriental plane LT was significantly higher in RGB and RB than in WL leaves. In both species, RB leaves showed higher <b>stomata</b> <b>size</b> than WL and RGB leaves. Light quality also affected photosynthesis-dependent volatile isoprenoids. In tomato, β-phellandrene was lower under RB and RGB compared to WL. However, RGB and RB stimulated α-pinene, carene and α-terpinene emissions. Oriental plane released about 14 nmol m- 2 s- 1 isoprene when growing at WL, while the emission was reduced under RGB and even more under RB. In summary, photosynthetic performance, leaf anatomy, biomass production, and volatile isoprenoids are affected by light quality differently in tomato and plane plants.

The chromosomal duplication of forest species aims to maximize economic interest features, such as those related to the development and forest gain. This study aimed to induce and verify polyploidy in root meristem cells of Hymenaea courbaril through morphological and cytological features. To induce polyploidy, the root meristems were exposed to the trifluralin herbicide at a concentration of 3 μM at 4 ºC for 14 (control), 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. Then, the rootlets were stored for 24 h in a closed flask and refrigerated in methanol: acetic acid solution (high purity) in the ratio 3 : 1, at - 4 ºC. Root meristems were digested in pectinase enzyme (SigmaTM). Mitotic cells were obtained by cell dissociation, air drying and hotplate. 30 cells in metaphase were colored with Giemsa 5 % and analyzed. The stomata were obtained from young plantlets of each treatment under the same physical and chemical conditions. For stomata analysis, was used epidermal print of adaxial leaf, with universal instant adhesive (Super BonderTM). 200 stomata were analyzed of each treatment. Among the four treatments evaluated, the exposure of root meristem for 96 h in 3 μM trifluralin, at 4 ºC, induced genome duplication in Hymenaea courbaril L. var. stilbocarpa with 2 n = 4 x = 48 chromosomes and <b>stomata</b> average <b>size</b> of 0. 215 mm, being superior to the other treatments...|$|R
40|$|Physiological and {{anatomical}} {{features of}} Cd-tolerance in Pfaffia glomerata were examined by exposing plantlets to nutrient solutions with increasing Cd concentrations (0, 15, 45, and 90 µmol Cd L- 1), and possible Cd-tolerance markers were established. Cd contents {{were found to}} be higher in roots than in shoots. According to the bio-concentration factor data, this species is effectively a Cd-hyperaccumulator, as previously attested. Cd induced the appearance of xeromorphic characteristics in leaves (decreased water potential, increased numbers and decreased <b>stomata</b> <b>size)</b> and increased root endodermis thickness. The enzymatic antioxidant systems of roots and leaves were differently affected by Cd. The coordinated activities of antioxidant enzymes were effective in reducing Cd-induced reactive oxygen species in plants, mainly in leaves. Root endodermis thickness, stomatal size and numbers, root superoxide dismutase, and guaiacol peroxidase, as well as leaf guaiacol peroxidase and catalase activities can all be considered Cd-tolerance markers in Pfaffia glomerata. Due to its high root Cd accumulation, Pfaffia glomerata may be useful in Cd-phytoextraction programs, however the pharmacological use of plants grown in the presence of Cd must be avoided...|$|E
40|$|Polyploidization {{plays an}} {{important}} role in species formation as chromosome doubling results in strong reproductive isolation between derivative and parental taxa. In this note I describe a new species, Mimulus peregrinus (Phrymaceae), which represents the first recorded instance of a new British polyploid species of Mimulus (2 n = 6 x = 92) that has arisen since the introduction of this genus into the United Kingdom in the 1800 ’s. M. peregrinus presents floral and vegetative characteristics intermediate between M. guttatus and M. luteus, but can be distinguished from all naturalized British Mimulus species and hybrids based on a combination of reproductive and vegetative traits. M. peregrinus displays high pollen and seed fertility as well as traits usually associated with genome doubling such as increased pollen and <b>stomata</b> <b>size.</b> The intermediate characteristics of M. peregrinus between M. guttatus (2 n = 2 x = 28) and M. luteus (2 n = 4 x = 60 - 62), and its close affinity with the highly sterile, triploid (2 n = 3 x = 44 - 45) hybrid taxon M. × robertsii (M. guttatus × M. luteus), suggests that M. peregrinus may constitute an example of recent allopolyploid speciation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCultivated peanut is an {{allotetraploid}} (genome type AABB) with a {{very narrow}} genetic base, therefore wild species are an attractive source of new variability and traits. Because most wild species are diploid, {{the first step of}} introgression usually involves hybridization of wild species and polyploidization to produce a synthetic allotetraploid (AABB) that is sexually compatible with peanut. This study investigates drought-related traits such as leaf morphology, transpiration profile, chlorophyll meter readings (SCMR), specific leaf area (SLA) and transpiration rate per leaf area for two wild diploids (Arachis duranensis and Arachis ipaënsis) that could be of interest for improvement of the peanut crop. Furthermore, the inheritance of the traits from the diploid to the tetraploid state was investigated. Results showed that whilst some diploid traits such as SCMR, are maintained through hybridization and polyploidization, most characters, such as the leaf area, <b>stomata</b> <b>size,</b> trichome density and transpiration profile, are substantially modified. The study concludes that direct evaluations of drought-related traits in wild diploids may be useful for evaluation of wild species to be used in introgression. However, evaluations on wild-derived synthetic tetraploids {{are likely to be more}} informative...|$|E
40|$|The Andean tree genus Polylepis (Rosaceae) is {{notorious for}} the high {{morphological}} plasticity of its species and the difficulty in their circumscription. The evolutionary mechanisms that have driven diversification of the genus are still poorly understood, with factors as diverse as ecological specialisation, reticulate evolution, polyploidisation and apomixis being proposed to contribute. In the present study, chromosome counts, flow cytometry and <b>stomata</b> guard cell <b>size</b> measurements were employed to document {{for the first time}} the presence of polyploidy in the genus and to infer ploidy levels for most species. Inferred ploidy levels show a clear progression from diploidy in cloud forest species to polyploidy (tetra- to octoploidy) in the morphologically and ecologically specialised incana group, indicating that polyploidisation may have played a major role in speciation processes and the colonisation of novel habitats during the Andean uplift. At least two species of Polylepis comprise populations with varying degrees of ploidy. More extensive studies are needed to obtain a better understanding of the prevalence and effects of intraspecific polyploidy in the genus...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{growing in}} the {{industrial}} areas and near the major roads absorb the pollutants at their foliar surface. In this paper, histological changes induced by air pollutants (from a cement factory combined with the pollution generated by human activities) in Lotus corniculatus L., Trifolium montanum L., T. pratense L. and T. repens L. leaves were followed. Some plant species have been identified {{to be able to}} absorb, detoxify and tolerate high levels of pollution. The tolerance degree is indirectly correlated with the intensity of injuries which occur in plant structure. Leaf thickness, height of palisade cells, diameter of the spongy cells, height and width of the upper epidermis cells, the thickness of the external wall of the upper epidermis cells, stomata length and stomatal index number of these species from highly polluted sites and lowly polluted sites were investigated by light microscopy. The <b>stomata</b> decrease in <b>size</b> and increase in density in leaves from high polluted sites. In the mesophyll cells (both in palisade and in spongy parenchyma) dark phenolic deposits could be observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} {{anatomy of}} the leaf of Campanula alliariifolia Willd. is examined. The purpose {{of this research is}} to identify features of the functional {{anatomy of the}} leaf of this species {{in order to understand the}} mechanism of its adaptation to new growth conditions. Plant material of research are plants of Campanula alliariifolia Willd. in: a) their natural growth habitat (the Caucasus, city Sochi) and b) the region of introduction (the steppe zone of Ukraine, city Donetsk). The research methods used are the standard techniques of anatomical research. In the region of introduction, the research reveals the formation of columnar mesophyll and stomata on the adaxial side of the leaf of C. alliariifolia; increase in mesophyll thickness, <b>stomata</b> frequency and <b>size,</b> and in the moisture content. The rosellate leaf area and the cauline leaf dry matter accumulation are greater than in the natural growth habitat. The main ways of adaptation are :a) qualitative and quantitative anatomical changes in leaves; b) correlation of changes of the majority of anatomical and morphological parameters; c) identical physiological and anatomical changes in leaves of both formations...|$|R
