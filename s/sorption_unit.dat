This implied that the NO 2 sorption effect is high in a range of ~[*] 3  mm from the surface of the transverse section. This was almost same average length to the cedar tracheid [16], thus it was suggested that the interface between tracheid and air plays a larger role in NO 2 sorption.

By utilising renewable thermal energy from the environment, that is, air, ground or water sources, significant reduction of primary energy use can be achieved. However, high cost, low coefficient of performance (COP) and large volume per unit thermal power produced have limited the proliferation of GDSHPs. In this work, exploiting the benefits of reversible chemical reactions in sorption systems, with no internal moving parts, noise, vibration and maintenance-free reactor design, two novel modular prototype sorption components were developed and evaluated experimentally. They were designed to operate {{as part of an}} intermittent cycle GDSHP to deliver heat directly to a load or to a stratified hot water store.

Prototype 1 demonstrated higher heating capacity of 73 W/litre at a temperature lift of 70 °C but exhibited lower COP of 1. 10. Given its higher COP but lower temperature lift, prototype 2 could be employed in a GDSHP designed for moderate heating demands or where a ground source heat exchanger is employed as the low temperature heat source.

By comparing wood powder with different grain sizes, we tried to evaluate the influence of the interface area in NO 2 sorption. The results were shown in Fig.  9. The result of 1.5 -mm-thick particle specimen was also shown in the figure. With grain sizes larger than 0.15 – 0.25  mm including the 1.5 -mm-thick particle specimen, sorption volume increased as grain size decreased. It was suggested that the interface area which was influenced to the ability was larger as grain size decreased. With grain sizes below 0.15 – 0.25  mm, it decreased to almost the same values (~[*] 0.6  µmol/g/h), regardless of grain size. One-way ANOVA did not show a significant difference between 0.020 – 0.075 and 0.075 – 0.150  mm. To evaluate the influence of interface area in more detail, the relationship between NO 2 <b>sorption</b> volume per <b>unit</b> weight and time and the specific surface area below 0.15 – 0.25  mm of wood powder was compared. The specific surface area in three wood powder grain sizes varies between 1.27 and 1.65  m 2 /g. However, one-way ANOVA did not show a significant difference between grain sizes. There was no correlation between specific surface area and NO 2 sorption volume.

It was speculated that the NO 2 sorption ability reached its greatest at the grain sizes below 0.25 – 0.50  mm. Based on the above results, especially in the wood powder below 0.25 – 0.50  mm grain size and discoid specimen, it would be necessary to elucidate with consideration of the pore size and microstructure in more detail.

DILUTION OPERATION AND SELF CONTAINED DESIGN For a mixture of 3 He and 4 He under 850 ¶mK and depending on the 3 He concentration, there is a phase separation between a “dilute phase ” of superfluid 4 He with saturated 3 He, and a “concentrated phase ” of pure 3 He. By decreasing the 3 He concentration of the dilute phase, the equilibrium between the two phases is out of balance and a 3 He dilution flow occurs from the concentrated phase to the dilute one. Due to the higher enthalpy of dilute 3 He, dilution of concentrated 3 He is an endothermic process. By using Radebaugh's 1 works on 3 He/ 4 He mixture properties, Eq.

During this project, ADA Technologies, Inc. demonstrated the following key elements of a successful regenerable mercury sorption process: (1) sorbents that have a high capacity for dissolved, ionic mercury; (2) removal of ionic mercury at greater than 99 % efficiency; and (3) thermal regeneration of the spent sorbent. ADA's process {{is based on the}} highly efficient and selective sorption of mercury by noble metals. Contaminated liquid flows through two packed columns that contain microporous sorbent particles on which a noble metal has been finely dispersed. A third column is held in reserve. When the sorbent is loaded with mercury to the point of breakthrough at the outlet of the second column, the first column is taken off-line and the flow of contaminated liquid is switched to the second and third columns. The spent column is regenerated by heating. A small flow of purge gas carries the desorbed mercury to a capture unit where the liquid mercury is recovered. Laboratory-scale tests with mercuric chloride solutions demonstrated the sorbents' ability to remove mercury from contaminated wastewater. Isotherms on surrogate wastes from DOE's Y- 12 Plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee showed greater than 99. 9 % mercury removal.

To evaluate {{the influence of}} thickness of longitudinal direction on NO 2 sorption volume, one-way ANOVA was performed. The results showed significant differences between thicknesses (p[*]=[*] 0.008), {{which suggests that the}} reaction interface between NO 2 and wood specimens is not just the apparent surface of the specimens but the internal surface area along the tracheid. Multiple comparisons showed that the sorption volume for 1.5 -mm-thick specimen was significantly less than for 3.0 - and 5.0 -mm-thick specimens, but no significant difference was evident between 3.0 - and 5.0 -mm-thick specimens. In previous study using concrete coated with photocatalyst under the system by referring to JIS R 1701 - 1 [12], the NOx including NO 2 removal volume per unit surface area and time in 12  h showed approx. 0.04  μmol/cm 2 /h [15]. Although the aeration time in previous study was different from that in this study, we compared these values as reference. As a result, the value in previous study is 5 times higher than that of plated specimen in the result of this study. In JIS R 1701 - 1 [12], the NO 2 sorption ability is evaluated by the sorption volume per surface area because the photocatalytic materials provide the surface coated with photocatalyst in a thin layer. However, the results shown in Fig.  5 indicated the influence of thickness of longitudinal direction in NO 2 sorption volume of cedar wood.

Substantial variations were revealed in the molecular nature of SOM. As a proportion of soil carbon the proportion of the carbonyl component ranged from 0. 006 to 0. 05, charcoal from 0 to 0. 15, protein from 0. 09 to 0. 29, aliphatic from 0. 14 to 0. 30, carbohydrate from 0. 21 to 0. 31, and lignin from 0. 05 to 0. 42.

30|$|The wood has {{directional}} property {{because of}} its tissue structure. Considering it, NO 2 sorption ability {{would be affected by}} the aeration condition. We tried to evaluate the influence of tissue structure by comparing the average NO 2 <b>sorption</b> volume per <b>unit</b> time and weight among plated specimen, particle and discoid specimen with a thickness in longitudinal direction of 1.5  mm. The aeration condition, which means contact condition between NO 2 and surface of specimen, of each specimen was different. The results are shown in Fig.  7 which is expressed the <b>sorption</b> volume per <b>unit</b> weight and time. The average NO 2 sorption volumes for discoid specimens for 5  h were 5.24 times values for the plated and particle specimens, and were significantly larger (p[*]<[*] 0.001). It is thought that NO 2 sorption volume is greatly affected by gas permeability. Generally, gas permeability in the longitudinal direction is much higher than that in the tangential or radial direction [17]. It is conjectured that the diffusion rate of NO 2 gas in discoid specimen was higher than that in the other specimen. Therefore, it was easier for the NO 2 gas to contact with extractives, the surface of the tracheid and the moisture which contributed to the NO 2 sorption ability. We expected that NO 2 sorption volume of particle specimen is larger than that of plated specimen because the surface area of particle specimen which can contact with the NO 2 is larger than that of plated specimen due to NO 2 flows on the surface regardless of the section under the aeration condition in particle specimen. However, NO 2 sorption volume of particle and plated specimen was 0.126 and 0.128  µmol/g/h, respectively, and almost same volume. Considered of this result, we need to consider of interface area between NO 2 and specimen and the effect of the surface in each aeration condition more in detail. In particle and plated specimen, the NO 2 <b>sorption</b> volume per <b>unit</b> time and weight of the specimen which the length of longitudinal direction is 1.5, 3.0 and 5.0  mm, was compared. The results are shown in Fig.  8. NO 2 sorption volume of 1.5 -mm-thickness in plated and particle specimens was 0.128 and 0.126  µmol/h/g, respectively, and no significant difference was observed. It seemed to be related to that the effect of NO 2 sorption was greater closer {{to the surface of the}} transverse section as we suggested in Fig.  6. However, in 3.0 - and 5.0 -mm-thick specimens, the NO 2 sorption volume of particle specimen was 1.7 and 2.3 times significantly larger than that of plated specimen, respectively (p[*]<[*] 0.05). It seemed that the influence of length of longitudinal direction was small in particle specimen. It is considered that the particle specimen contacted with NO 2 regardless of the three sections of specimen, therefore, the interface area of particle specimen was larger than that of plated specimen and the structure of tracheid did not have a big role in the aeration condition of particle specimen. However, these need to be more considered in detail to clarify the mechanism of NO 2 sorption in the interface between NO 2 and specimen.|$|R

40|$|The {{accident}} at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011 released {{large quantities of}} radiocaesium (RCs) isotopes into the terrestrial environments. This accident renewed our interest in the fate of RCs in agricultural ecosystems because the consumption of RCs-contaminated foods can be a significant pathway of radiation exposure to humans. The RCs cation distributed in soil solution can be absorbed by plants due to its analogy to potassium (K). A large number of studies were performed in Europe after the Chernobyl accident and gathered information and models of soil-to-plant RCs transfer. The soil and plant conditions in the Fukushima affected area {{are different from those}} in Europe since, for example, the major soils in the affected area are of volcanic origin and the dominant crop is flooded rice grown in anaerobic conditions. Due to these differences, it could be speculated that the specific mechanisms ruling the RCs transfer in the Fukushima affected area may be different from those in Europe. The overall objective of this thesis is to assess the vulnerability of Fukushima soils for RCs transfer to crops. Specifically, this research was set up (1) to investigate the key factors affecting the RCs sorption in Fukushima soils and (2) to investigate the mechanisms of the soil-to-plant RCs transfer to flooded rice. The soil radiocaesium interception potential (RIP) and other major soil physicochemical properties were characterised for representative soils (N = 51) collected in the Fukushima affected area. The RIP ranged a factor of 50 among the soils and the RIP of Andosols was significantly smaller (P < 0. 05) than that of other soil types, indicating the role of the soil mineralogy in RCs sorption. The RIP was positively but weakly correlated to the soil clay content. The slope of the correlation between the RIP and clay content revealed that the RIP per unit clay was only 4. 8 mol kg ― 1 clay, c. threefold smaller than that for European soils, suggesting, on average, more short-range-ordered minerals and less micaceous minerals in the clay fraction of Fukushima soils. The RIP was most strongly and negatively correlated to soil organic matter content, which is likely an indirect statistical effect since large organic matter content was observed in Andosols or soils with larger content of short-range-ordered minerals. Multiple regression with soil organic matter content and cation exchange capacity explained the soil RIP (R 2 = 0. 61), allowing us to map the RIP based on existing soil map information. A numerical analysis was subsequently performed to evaluate existing soil-to-plant transfer models calibrated to European soils, to predict RCs transfer for Fukushima soils. These models have soil clay content and soil exchangeable K as input parameters which, in turn, affect the RCs transfer because of their effects on the RIP and K concentration in soil solution (mK). The existing models overestimated the RIP for the soils from the Fukushima affected area when predicted from the soil clay content, and overestimated mK predicted from the exchangeable K content. These prediction results suggested that, on average, Fukushima soils are more vulnerable for RCs transfer than European soils at equal soil clay and exchangeable K content. The mechanisms of soil-to-plant RCs transfer in flooded soils were investigated. It was hypothesised that the RCs transfer may be large in flooded soils because of ammonium (NH 4) accumulation in soils mobilising RCs. Nine soils collected from paddy fields in the Fukushima affected area were either cropped with rice in flooded conditions or with ryegrass in unsaturated conditions. Contrary to the hypothesis, the transfer factor (TF) of RCs was, on average, 4. 0 -fold larger for ryegrass than for flooded rice. The flooded soils showed 0. 6 – 2. 5 -fold lower RCs mobility than in unsaturated soils, in which the mobility was expressed as the RCs concentration ratio in the soil solution to that in the soil solid phase. Corrected for ion competition effects, these results suggested that soil flooding increased fixation of RCs in soils. The RCs concentration in flooded rice shoots was positively correlated with the RCs:K concentration ratio in soil solution (R 2 = 0. 77), indicating that the RCs in rice shoots can be predicted with soil solution composition, as it was established for other crops grown in unsaturated soils. The larger TF in ryegrass (unsaturated soils) than in rice (flooded soils) was attributed to a combination of the larger K uptake in ryegrass and smaller diffusivity of K in unsaturated soils, both contributing to K depletion in the ryegrass rhizosphere, thereby increasing RCs uptake to ryegrass. The pot trial data and new field observations of RCs TF in grassland in the Fukushima affected area were modelled with existing soil-to-plant RCs transfer models calibrated to European soils. These models again underestimated the TF, largely because the RCs <b>sorption</b> per <b>unit</b> clay in Fukushima soils is smaller than that in European soils. Refining the models with the measured RIP and soil solution K concentration provided acceptable predictions of the TF for the pot trials and field data. The traditional concept that RCs is derived only from soils was challenged by focusing {{on the role of the}} stem base of flooded rice on foliar RCs uptake from irrigation water. A bi-compartmental device was developed which discriminates the stem base from root RCs uptake from solution, thereby using two RCs isotopes (137 Cs and 134 Cs) in each compartment. The RCs uptake was linear over time (0 – 24 h). The RCs uptake by the entire plant, expressed per dry weight of the exposed parts, was 6 -fold larger for the uptake by roots than by the stem base. At equal RCs concentration in the solutions in both compartments, the RCs uptake by the exposed stem base and root contributed almost equally to the RCs concentration in entire shoots. Reducing K supply to roots not only increased the root RCs uptake but also increased the RCs uptake via the stem base. The latter suggested that the foliar uptake of RCs is controlled by the internal K status of the plants. This outcome was the first experimental demonstration of the active and internally regulated foliar RCs uptake by rice stem base. Scenario calculation for the Fukushima affected region predicted that RCs in irrigation water could be a source of RCs in rice as indirectly suggested from the field data. To summarise, this research has endorsed the earlier established concept that RCs uptake by plants is controlled by the soil solution RCs and K concentrations. However, the existing models require recalibration for Fukushima soils and plant types because the RCs <b>sorption</b> per <b>unit</b> clay is significantly smaller in Fukushima soils than in European soils. Furthermore, irrigation water in flooded paddies can be an overlooked source of RCs transfer to rice and may impede the expected long-term decrease in RCs transfer to rice. This finding suggests that irrigation water potentially persists to contribute to RCs transfer to rice, despite the small contribution of RCs uptake via the stem base relative to the root RCs uptake. The confirmation of the validity of the earlier mechanistic models on soil-to-plant RCs transfer, provided recalibration for the soil chemical part, suggests that these models can now be used to map the RCs concentrations in food crops in the Fukushima affected area.

40|$|Diffusion of liquids {{into and}} through {{polymers}} {{is an important}} factor that negatively may influence the durability or lifetime of a polymer structure used in industrial applications. In this work two types of polymers, a liquid crystalline polymer (LCP, Vectra A 950) and various thermoset resins as used in fibre reinforced plastics (FRP) process equipment were studied with regard to barrier properties, chemical resistance and long-term performance. LCP are known for their outstanding chemical resistance and barrier properties. FRP used in process equipment may be a cost-efficient solution in chemically aggressive environments where standard carbon or stainless steel cannot be used due to its limited corrosion resistance. Transport properties of typical industrial environments were determined for the LCP and the influence of annealing and orientation was investigated to study whether the barrier properties can be improved. The possibility to use LCP as cost-effective lining for FRP was explored. Special focus was put on the diffusion of water and its effect on long-term transport properties and stability of thermoset resins as the performance of FRP is strongly related to the diffusion of water. The results showed that Vectra A 950 was suitable for organic solvent and non-oxidising acid environments. Its transport properties were gravimetrically determined and found to be 10 to 102 times lower than that of a high barrier fluoropolymer of type FEP. The degree of molecular packing increased with annealing time both below and above the melting point. Below the melting point this was – at least – partly due to crystal formation whereas above the melting point other mechanisms were involved. The effects of annealing and orientation on the transport properties in LCP were, however, very small or not significant and probably significantly longer annealing times are required. LCP has potential to be used as lining material for FRP as the use of an LCP-lining substantially reduced the permeability of and the solute sorption in a bisphenol A epoxy-based vinyl ester resin. The bonding strength was improved significantly by a combined abrasive and oxygen plasma treatment. The long-term sorption of water in thermoset resins including bisphenol A epoxy-based vinyl ester, novolac-based vinyl ester, urethane modified vinyl ester and bisphenol A polyester resins was found to increase with exposure time whereas the diffusion coefficient was not significantly affected. It was shown that the presence of water induced relaxation processes that were considered to be the primarily reason for the increase in sorption coefficient in comparison to degradation processes, such as hydrolysis, causing osmotic processes. A general relationship for the estimation of the sorption coefficient at 80 ºC in dependence of the water activity and the <b>sorption</b> coefficient at <b>unit</b> activity independent of the resin type was established...|$|R
