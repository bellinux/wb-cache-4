25|$|<b>Sexting</b> is the {{practice}} of an individual using cell phone messaging to send nude or semi-nude images of themselves to others (such as friends or dating partners). These may be passed along to others or be posted on the Internet. In many jurisdictions, the age of consent {{is lower than the}} age of majority, and a minor who is over the age of consent can legally have sex with a person of the same age. Many laws on child pornography were passed before cell phone cameras became common among teenagers over the age of consent and <b>sexting</b> was understood as a phenomenon. Because laws were created around the age of majority, teenagers who are legally able to consent to sex can be charged with production and distribution of child pornography if they send naked images of themselves to friends or sex partners of the same age. The University of New Hampshire’s Crimes Against Children Research Center estimates that 7 percent of people arrested on suspicion of child pornography production in 2009 were teenagers who shared images with peers consensually. In some countries, mandatory sentencing requires anybody convicted of such an offence to be placed on a sex offender registry.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the sixth}} century the Rule of St. Benedict gives the {{detailed}} composition of this Office. <b>Sext,</b> like Terce and None, was composed at most of three psalms, of which the choice was fixed, the Deus in adjutorium, a hymn, a lesson (capitulum), a versicle, the Kyrie Eleison, and the customary concluding prayer and dismissal [...] One {{of the most common}} hymns used at <b>Sext</b> is Rector Potens, Verax Deus ...|$|R

John Cassian tells us that in Palestine three psalms were recited for <b>Sext,</b> as also for Terce and None. This number {{was adopted by the}} Rules of St. Benedict, St. Columbanus, St. Isidore, St. Fructuosus, and to a certain extent by the Roman Church. However, Cassian says that in some provinces three psalms were said at Terce, six at <b>Sext,</b> and nine at None.

South Australia followed in 2016, with a bill making it illegal to distribute or threaten to distribute invasive nude photographs. New South Wales passed a Bill that criminalised the distribution, or threatened distribution, of intimate photos or videos, which commenced on 25 August 2017.
