5|$|Refined <b>sugar</b> is {{made from}} raw <b>sugar</b> that has {{undergone}} a refining process to remove the molasses. Raw <b>sugar</b> is sucrose which is extracted from sugarcane or <b>sugar</b> beet. While raw <b>sugar</b> can be consumed, the refining process removes unwanted tastes and results in refined <b>sugar</b> or white <b>sugar.</b>|$|E
5|$|Refined <b>sugar</b> {{is widely}} used for {{industrial}} needs for higher quality. Refined <b>sugar</b> is purer (ICUMSA below 300) than raw <b>sugar</b> (ICUMSA over 1,500).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Government {{and health}} organisations {{worldwide}} have recently reviewed {{the evidence on}} the role of dietary <b>sugars</b> in relation to health outcomes. Hence, it is timely to review current intakes of dietary <b>sugars</b> with respect to this guidance and as a benchmark for future surveillance. METHODS: This review collates data from nationally representative dietary surveys across the world and reports estimates of intakes of total and added <b>sugars,</b> and sucrose in different population subgroups. Total <b>sugars</b> includes all mono- and disaccharides; namely, glucose, fructose, lactose, sucrose and maltose. Added and free <b>sugars</b> differ in the quantity of natural <b>sugars</b> included in their definitions. Free <b>sugars</b> include <b>sugars</b> naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates, whereas added <b>sugars</b> typically only refer to those added during processing. RESULTS: Most countries reported intakes of total <b>sugars,</b> with fewer reporting intakes of added <b>sugars</b> and sucrose. No country reported intakes of free <b>sugars.</b> The available data suggest that total <b>sugars</b> as a percentage of energy were highest in the infant (< 4 years), with mean values ranging from 20. 0 % to 38. 4 %, and decreased over the lifespan to 13. 5 – 24. 6 % in adults. Intakes of added <b>sugars</b> were higher in school-aged children and adolescents (up to 19 % of total energy) compared to younger children or adults. CONCLUSIONS: Further research into the dietary patterns contributing to added <b>sugars</b> intake in children and adolescents is warranted. It would also be beneficial to policy guidance if future dietary surveys employed a uniform way of expressing <b>sugars</b> that is feasible to measure and has public health significance...|$|R
5|$|<b>Sugar</b> {{also led}} to some {{industrialization}} of areas where <b>sugar</b> cane was grown. For example, Lieutenant J. Paterson, of the Bengal establishment, persuaded the British Government that <b>sugar</b> cane could be cultivated in British India with many advantages and at less expense than in the West Indies; as a result, <b>sugar</b> factories were established in Bihar in eastern India. During the Napoleonic Wars, <b>sugar</b> beet production increased in continental Europe {{because of the difficulty}} of importing <b>sugar</b> when shipping was subject to blockade. By 1880, the <b>sugar</b> beet was the main source of <b>sugar</b> in Europe. It was cultivated in Lincolnshire and other parts of England, although the United Kingdom continued to import the main part of its <b>sugar</b> from its colonies.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} nineteenth century, <b>sugar</b> was {{purchased}} in loaves, {{which had to be}} cut using implements called <b>sugar</b> nips. In later years, granulated <b>sugar</b> was more usually sold in bags. <b>Sugar</b> cubes were produced in the nineteenth century. The first inventor of a process to make <b>sugar</b> in cube form was the Moravian Jakub Kryštof Rad, director of a <b>sugar</b> company in Dačice. He began <b>sugar</b> cube production after being granted a five-year patent for the process on January 23, 1843. Henry Tate of Tate & Lyle was another early manufacturer of <b>sugar</b> cubes at his refineries in Liverpool and London. Tate purchased a patent for <b>sugar</b> cube manufacture from German Eugen Langen, who in 1872 had invented a different method of processing of <b>sugar</b> cubes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{commodity}} {{that was}} a prominent source of trade was the production of <b>sugar</b> from the crop <b>sugar</b> cane. The original habitat of <b>sugar</b> was in India, where it was taken and planted in various islands. Once reaching {{to the people of}} the Iberian Peninsula, it was further migrated across the Atlantic Ocean. In the 16th century, the first plantations of <b>sugar</b> were started in the New World, marking the last great stage of migration of the cane to the West. Because of the conflict of transporting <b>sugar</b> in its raw form, <b>sugar</b> was not associated with commerce until the act of refining it came into play; this act became the center for industry. Venice was the center for refining during the Middle Ages, therefore making them the chief traders of <b>sugar.</b> Although, the Spanish and Portuguese held the monopolies of the <b>sugar</b> cane fields in America, they were being supplied by Venice. In the 17th century, England dominated Venice and became the center for refining and cultivating sugar; this leadership was maintained until the rise of French industry. <b>Sugar</b> throughout the 17th century was still considered a luxury until the latter half of the 17th century when the <b>sugar</b> was being produced in mass quantities making it available to the mass of the English people. This turn of events made the <b>sugar</b> a commodity, because the crop was not being used in only special occasion, but in all daily meals.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{and white}} {{granulated}} <b>sugar</b> are 97% to nearly 100% carbohydrates, respectively, {{with less than}} 2% water, and no dietary fiber, protein or fat (table). Brown <b>sugar</b> contains a moderate amount of iron (15% of the Reference Daily Intake in a 100 gram amount, see table), but a typical serving of 4 grams (one teaspoon), would provide 15 calories and a negligible amount of iron or any other nutrient. Because brown <b>sugar</b> contains 5–10% molasses reintroduced during processing, its value to some consumers is a richer flavor than white <b>sugar.</b>|$|E

The evolutionary progression from shell reduction to shell loss has been correlated with inhibition of the mineralization process in shell formation.

ObjectiveThis cross-sectional study identified sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics associated with added <b>sugars</b> intake among US adults (18 years and older) using the 2010 National Health Interview Survey data (n= 24, 967). MethodsThe outcome variable was added <b>sugars</b> intake from foods and beverages using scoring algorithms to convert dietary screener frequency responses on nine items to estimates of individual dietary intake of added <b>sugars</b> in teaspoons per day. Added <b>sugars</b> intake was categorized into tertiles (lowest, middle, highest) stratified by sex. The explanatory variables were sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios for the highest and middle tertile added <b>sugars</b> intake groups as compared with the lowest tertile group. ResultsEstimated median added <b>sugars</b> intake was 17. 6 tsp/d for men and 11. 7 tsp/d for women. For men and women, those who had significantly greater odds for being in the highest tertile of added <b>sugars</b> intake (men: 22 ̆ 030522. 0 tsp/d; women: 22 ̆ 030514. 6 tsp/d) were younger, less educated, had lower income, were less physically active, were current smokers, and were former or current infrequent/light drinkers, whereas non-Hispanic other/multiracial and those living in the West had significantly lower odds for being in the highest tertile of added <b>sugars</b> intake. Different patterns were found by sex. Non-Hispanic black men had lower odds for being in the highest tertile of added <b>sugars</b> intake, whereas non-Hispanic black women had greater odds for being in the highest tertile.

40|$|National {{food supply}} data and dietary surveys are {{essential}} to estimate nutrient intakes and monitor trends, yet there are few published studies estimating added <b>sugars</b> consumption. The purpose of this report was to estimate and trend added <b>sugars</b> intakes and their contribution to total energy intake among Canadians by, first, using Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) nutrition survey data of intakes of <b>sugars</b> in foods and beverages, and second, using Statistics Canada availability data and adjusting these for wastage to estimate intakes. Added <b>sugars</b> intakes were estimated from CCHS data by categorizing the <b>sugars</b> content of food groups as either added or naturally occurring. Added <b>sugars</b> accounted for approximately half of total <b>sugars</b> consumed. Annual availability data were obtained from Statistics Canada CANSIM database. Estimates for added <b>sugars</b> were obtained by summing the availability of “sugars and syrups” with availability of “soft drinks” (proxy for high fructose corn syrup) and adjusting for waste. Analysis of both survey and availability data suggests that added <b>sugars</b> average 11 %– 13 % of total energy intake. Availability data indicate that added <b>sugars</b> intakes have been stable or modestly declining {{as a percent of}} total energy over the past three decades.

40|$|Consumption {{of added}} <b>sugars</b> in Canada is often {{reported}} {{to be higher than}} data suggest. Both popular and scientific articles often incorrectly report unadjusted national food supply (availability) data as actual consumption data. Additionally, when describing Canadian eating habits, US data is often cited. This does not provide an accurate reflection of Canadian consumption patterns, as Canadian intakes of many foods and beverages containing added <b>sugars</b> are substantially below US levels (1). Misinformation about added <b>sugars</b> consumption may be linked to complications associated with their estimation. Such difficulties include estimating waste adjustment factors to determine apparent consumption from food availability data; missing availability data for some sources of added <b>sugars</b> (notably corn sweeteners); and the lack of a comprehensive database of added <b>sugars</b> content in foods. In this article, the available literature and various reports are used to provide the best estimates of added <b>sugars</b> consumption in Canada.
