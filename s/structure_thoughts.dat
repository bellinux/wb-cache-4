5000|$|Language {{of thought}} {{theories}} {{rely on the}} belief that mental representation has linguistic <b>structure.</b> <b>Thoughts</b> are [...] "sentences in the head", meaning they take place within a mental language. Two theories work in support of the language of thought theory. Causal syntactic theory of mental practices hypothesizes that mental processes are causal processes defined over the syntax of mental representations. Representational theory of mind hypothesizes that propositional attitudes are relations between subjects and mental representations. In tandem, these theories explain how the brain can produce rational thought and behavior. All three of these theories were inspired by the development of modern logical inference. They were also inspired by Alan Turing's work on causal processes that require formal procedures within physical machines.|$|E
40|$|A {{connection}} between self-monitoring, {{which is an}} individual difference in concern about self-presentation, and partner knowledge structures, which is how people organize thoughts about their current romantic partner, is explored in this study. There were two competing hypotheses. If people <b>structure</b> <b>thoughts</b> about their partner in a way similar to how they structure their social worlds, then low self-monitors would have integrated partner knowledge structures and high self-monitors would have compartmentalized partner knowledge structures. If people <b>structure</b> <b>thoughts</b> about their partner {{in a way that}} reflects their relationship motivations and needs then we would find the opposite pattern of results. We used a measure of compartmentalization and integration as well as Snyder’s (1974) Self-Monitoring Scale to explore our hypotheses. Although both low self-monitors and high self-monitors had relatively compartmentalized partner knowledge structures, we found support for the relationship motivations and needs hypothesis. Low self-monitors had more compartmentalized partner knowledge structures than did high self-monitors. In fact, low self-monitors were more likely than high self-monitors to have completely compartmentalized views of their partners. Reasons for these findings, limitations of this study, and future directions are discussed...|$|E

For {{the first time since}} then, China, a non-Western power, poses a challenge to that dominance, with the result that “neither Australia nor New Zealand has ever seriously considered how we would defend our interests and secure our countries in a region which was not dominated by our great and powerful Anglo-Saxon friends. ” 1 China is the new variable in the Asia-Pacific equation, and New Zealand is now required to factor this new element into its strategic calculations for the future. China’s ascendancy in the Asia-Pacific region will have a huge impact on New Zealand’s future strategic outlook. The purpose of this essay will be to design, as simply as possible, a way to <b>structure</b> <b>thoughts</b> and discussion about the defence relationship between New Zealand and China, from a New Zealand perspective. It will aim to establish a basic framework centred around a number of themes in order to provide a platform for analysis in the future.

40|$|Companies {{today are}} facing an {{increasingly}} competition {{and with that}} the companies {{have to be more}} innovative and create new ideas and concepts on a tighter time schedule. This situation increases the demands to use and reuse knowledge, not only figures and facts but even the knowledge that comes with experience such as design alternatives and the reasons behind why selecting one alternative over another, also called Design Rationale. The purpose of the thesis was to investigate and understand the organizations needs of Design Rationale and to identify and try out potential approaches to finally recommend a method so {{that it is possible to}} capture Design Rationale in an early development phase. In order to find an approach to capture Design Rationale, needs for a possible capturing tool hade to be identified. This was made through personal interviews among the personnel at Volvo Aero, attending meetings in different projects, observations and many discussions both within and without Volvo Aero. Furthermore three computer based systems where chosen for evaluation since computers are used as the natural way of working and writing at Volvo Aero. These systems where then evaluated and weighted against the needs to be able to se if the systems fulfilled the requirements. Two of the systems where also tested. Computer tools can effectively help organize and <b>structure</b> <b>thoughts</b> and decisions. A good overview of the situation is one of the effects from this. When awareness and a basic level of understanding about Design Rationale benefits are received Design Rationale can be captured using the systems suggested. To be able to implement and capture support and methods for Design Rationale, people need to be aware of Design Rationale existence and it is essential that it becomes a part of and implemented in the design culture at the company.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} agglomeration externalities. Agglomeration externalities can roughly be defined as advantages and disadvantages local firms experience when locating close to other firms. An old debate exists over the question whether firms benefit more from being close to firms in the same industry, or from being close to firms in {{a large number of}} different industries. Put differently, researchers have tried to assess whether firms are better off in specialised cities or in diversified cities. To date, empirical evidence is contradictory and the issue remains unresolved. A plausible explanation that is studied in this thesis is that agglomeration externalities are different in different situations. Another reason explaining why the diversity-versus-specialisation debate has not reached a conclusion that is scrutinized in the thesis is that the distinction between diversity and specialization constitutes a false dichotomy. Industries are related to each other in terms of their technologies. Therefore, some industries are likely to generate more spillovers for each other than others. The thesis is rooted in the evolutionary economic paradigm. For example, industry life cycle theorizing is used to <b>structure</b> <b>thoughts</b> on how agglomeration externalities change as industries mature. Furthermore, evolutionary economics regards economic development as a path dependent process in which new activities are added to old activities by adapting and recombining existing technologies into new ones in a branching process. This notion underlies one of the main contributions of the thesis: the development of a Revealed Relatedness index. This index extracts information about technological relatedness from the product portfolios of plants, allowing the quantification of technological relatedness between almost all pairs of manufacturing industries in the economy. The resulting relatedness structure of the economy proofs to be an important driver of the structural transformation we observe in Swedish regional economies. Methodologically the thesis is quantitative in nature. To study variations in agglomeration externalities, it distinguishes between traditional categories of localisation, Jacobs and urbanisation externalities. Localisation externalities are advantages and disadvantages to firms generated by nearby other firms in the same industry, Jacobs externalities are derived from a large variety of local economic activities, and urbanisation externalities are associated with a large local population. Subsequently, the demarcation between localisation and Jacobs externalities is softened by adding two new classes: related localisation externalities and related Jacobs externalities. These categories capture benefits (or costs) of a local presence of related industries, and of local diversity in related industries, respectively. The most important finding is that agglomeration externalities indeed change as industries and plants mature. In particular, local diversity has a beneficial effect in early development stages, whereas localisation effects are strongest in more mature phases. The importance of technological relatedness is manifest in the fact that related localisation externalities lead to persistently better survival chances. The thesis concludes with the presentation of two broad research agendas. The first suggests studying agglomeration externalities across contexts in a large-scale comparative analysis. The second is concerned with the consequences of reconceptualising the economy as a constantly evolving network of technologically related activities...|$|E

Although such representational differences {{can have a}} profound impact on decision-making, relatively {{little is known about the}} factors contributing to the development and generalizability of different types of category representations. These issues are addressed by investigating the impact of training methodology and category structures using a traditional empirical approach as well as the novel adaptation of computational modeling techniques from the machine learning literature. Experiment 1 focused on rule-based (RB) category <b>structures</b> <b>thought</b> to promote between-category representations. Participants learned two sets of two categories during training and were subsequently tested on a novel categorization problem using the training categories. Classification training resulted in a bias toward between-category representations whereas concept training resulted in a bias toward within-category representations. Experiment 2 focused on information-integration (II) category <b>structures</b> <b>thought</b> to promote within-category representations. With II structures, there was a bias toward within-category representations regardless of training methodology. Furthermore, in both experiments, computational modeling suggests that only within-category representations could support generalization during the test phase. These data suggest that within-category representations may be dominant and more robust for supporting the reconfiguration of current knowledge to support generalization...|$|R
