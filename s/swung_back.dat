5|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, Sarnia's voters have been moderate, {{and the party}} {{affiliation}} of its Members of Parliament, both provincial and federal, has <b>swung</b> <b>back</b> and forth largely between the Liberal and Progressive Conservative parties (a New Democrat was elected in their 1990 provincial wave).|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 20th century, the {{pendulum}} had <b>swung</b> <b>back</b> towards road transport. The Cromford Canal was largely abandoned in 1944, and several of the rail lines passing through the Peak were closed as uneconomic in the 1960s as part of the Beeching Axe. The Woodhead Line was closed between Hadfield and Penistone. Parts of the trackbed are now used for the Trans Pennine Trail, the stretch between Hadfield and Woodhead being known specifically as the Longdendale Trail.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} four years, neither Henry nor the barons were able to restore {{stability}} in England, and power <b>swung</b> <b>back</b> {{and forth between the}} different factions. One of the priorities for the new regime was to settle the long-running dispute with France and, at the end of 1259, Henry and Eleanor left for Paris to negotiate the final details of a peace treaty with King Louis, escorted by Simon de Montfort and much of the baronial government. Under the treaty, Henry gave up any claim to his family's lands in the north of France, but was confirmed as the legitimate ruler of Gascony and various neighbouring territories in the south, giving homage and recognising Louis as his feudal lord for these possessions.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, I {{like them}} both very much!" [...] {{answered}} Paul, {{and attempted to}} pass on. With a frown Haskett caught {{him by the arm}} and <b>swung</b> him <b>back.</b>|$|R
60|$|Brissenden {{went home}} late that night; {{and just as}} he mounted {{the first step of}} the car, he <b>swung</b> {{suddenly}} <b>back</b> on Martin and thrust into his hand a small, tightly crumpled wad of paper.|$|R
5|$|The {{long jump}} {{is one of}} the oldest track and field events, having its roots as one of the events within the ancient Greek pentathlon contest. The athletes would take a short run up and jump into an area of dug up earth, with the winner being the one who jumped farthest. Small weights (Halteres) were held in each hand during the jump then <b>swung</b> <b>back</b> and dropped near the end to gain extra {{momentum}} and distance. The modern long jump, standardised in England and the United States around 1860, bears resemblance to the ancient event although no weights are used. Athletes sprint along a length of track that leads to a jumping board and a sandpit. The athletes must jump before a marked line and their achieved distance is measured from the nearest point of sand disturbed by the athlete's body.|$|E
5|$|The {{disagreements}} {{between the}} leading barons {{involved in the}} revolt soon became evident. Montfort championed radical reforms that would place further limitations on the authority {{and power of the}} major barons as well as the Crown; others promoted only moderate change, while the conservative barons expressed concerns about the existing limitations on the King's powers. Over the next four years, neither Henry nor the barons were able to restore stability in England, and power <b>swung</b> <b>back</b> and forth between the different factions. By early 1263, what remained of Henry's authority had disintegrated and the country slipped back towards open civil war. Montfort convened a council of rebel barons in Oxford to pursue his radical agenda and by October, England faced a likely civil war. Montfort marched east with an army and London rose up in revolt. Montfort took Henry and Queen Eleanor prisoner, and although he maintained a fiction of ruling in Henry's name, the rebels completely replaced the royal government and household with their own, trusted men.|$|E
5|$|By 21:15, Pinsum {{realised}} {{that his}} heavily laden ship could not outrun Amethyst and reduced his speed, turning sharply {{in front of}} the British ship in an attempt to rake her. Seymour was prepared for the manoeuvre and countered it by turning sharply away from Thétis so that the French broadside fell harmlessly into the sea and both frigates performed a complete circle before returning to their previous course. Seymour then <b>swung</b> <b>back</b> towards the French ship, bringing Amethyst alongside and pouring a heavy fire into Thétis, which replied in kind. For 25 minutes, the frigates continued firing on one another from close range as they sailed westwards. At 21:40, Pinsum again attempted to rake Amethyst, trying to cross the British ship's stern as she pulled ahead. Seymour countered by slowing his ship and the French rigging became tangled in the British, the firing continuing as the crews worked to free their ships from one another. Separating a few minutes later, the frigates continued their close-range duel. Amethyst again pulled ahead at 22:05, Seymour successfully crossing the bow of the French ship from port and raking her before swinging back along the starboard side to resume the close range exchange of broadsides.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] {{replied the}} figure, in a shrill undertone; and, arising quickly from the bed, {{he made a}} single step toward our hero, while an iron lamp that {{depended}} over-head <b>swung</b> convulsively <b>back</b> from his approach.|$|R
60|$|There was a grumbling {{sound and}} a clanking and jarring of keys. The door <b>swung</b> heavily <b>back,</b> and a short, deep-chested man {{stood in the}} opening, with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon his {{protruded}} face and twinkling distrustful eyes.|$|R
60|$|None came. The car gyrated madly and <b>swung</b> slowly <b>back</b> to equilibrium. We picked {{ourselves}} up, tossed rugs, coats, instruments, promiscuously overboard, {{and mounted}} again. The chine {{of the tall}} hill, our stumbling-block, fell back and was lost, and we swept forward into formless shadow.|$|R
25|$|In South Korea, {{educational}} policy on characters has <b>swung</b> <b>back</b> and forth, often swayed by education ministers' personal opinions. At present, {{middle and high}} school students (grades 7 to 12) are taught 1,800 characters, albeit with the principal focus on recognition, with the aim of achieving newspaper literacy.|$|E
25|$|The 2004 general {{election}} would see Liberal candidate Jack Flaherty regain the seat for the Liberals as Mary O'Neill {{went down to}} defeat. Flaherty only lasted a single term in office as the riding <b>swung</b> <b>back</b> into the Progressive Conservative column when candidate Ken Allred won a strong majority.|$|E
25|$|By 1858 {{attention}} had <b>swung</b> <b>back</b> {{to local}} issues with a land dispute in New Plymouth prompting Governor Thomas Gore Brown {{to call out}} its militia under Captain Charles Brown. A prelude to {{what was to become}} the First Taranaki War and a period of conflict in the North Island until 1872.|$|E
6000|$|She found life inexpressible to Mr. Polly. She {{addressed}} some unseen hearers. [...] "You filthy little Beasts!" [...] {{she cried}} {{with a sharp}} note of agony in her voice, and <b>swung</b> herself <b>back</b> over the wall and vanished. There was a squeal of pain and fear, and a swift, fierce altercation.|$|R
60|$|Madeline Hammond gazed in bewilderment at {{the little}} man, so pale and shaken, and a protest trembled upon her lips; {{but it was never}} uttered, for this half-drunken cowboy now {{appeared}} to be a cool, grim-smiling devil; and stretching out a long arm, he grasped her and <b>swung</b> her <b>back</b> to the bench.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now go ahead!" [...] {{he called}} out, and Dan opened the door, and <b>swung</b> it <b>back</b> and forth several times. He also showed his hat on a stick, {{and in a}} trice came several shots, one going through the head-covering and {{entering}} the closet in the corner. Then he swung the hat out again, and another shot followed.|$|R
25|$|After {{striking}} the ball Bradman used an exaggerated follow through, {{so much so}} that his bat would be <b>swung</b> <b>back</b> over his shoulder and along his spine, like a golfer. Most batsmen ended their stroke with their bat held high in the air, Bradman's method allowed him to hit the ball with greater power.|$|E
25|$|Aston Martin had {{a troubled}} history {{after the third}} quarter of the 20th century but has also enjoyed long periods of success and stability. “In the first century we went {{bankrupt}} seven times”, incoming CEO Andy Palmer told Automotive News Europe. “The second century is about making sure that is not the case.” On the back of strong demand for Aston Martin’s DB11, its first all-new model in a decade, the company <b>swung</b> <b>back</b> to a profit {{in the first quarter of}} 2017.|$|E
25|$|The Republican Party {{had held}} all five Freeholder seats until 2006, {{but after the}} 2006 and 2008 elections, Democrats {{controlled}} the Board by a 3–2 margin. The Board <b>swung</b> <b>back</b> {{in favor of the}} Republicans after the 2009 election when Republican John Curley beat Democrat Sean Byrnes. Both were running to succeed former Freeholder Director Barbara McMorrow, a Democrat, who had chosen not to seek re-election. In 2010, former mayor of Neptune City, NJ, Thomas Arnone (R) and incumbent Freeholder Robert Clifton (R) won seats giving Republicans control of the Board of Chosen Freeholders by a 4–1 margin.|$|E

6000|$|... "You were nearer going overboard," [...] he retorted. [...] "You shouldn't have tried." [...] He had {{not fully}} {{formulated}} his reproach {{when the ship}} righted herself with a counter-roll and plunge, and they were <b>swung</b> staggering <b>back</b> together against the bulkhead. The door of the gangway was within reach, and Breckon laid hold of the rail beside it and put the girl within. [...] "Are you hurt?" [...] he asked.|$|R
25|$|Upon his dismissal, the Grand Duke was {{immediately}} appointed commander-in-chief and viceroy in the Caucasus (replacing Count Illarion Vorontsov-Dashkov). While the Grand Duke was officially in command, General Yudenich was the driving {{figure in the}} Russian Caucasus army, so the Grand Duke focused on the civil administration. Their opponent was the Ottoman Empire. While the Grand Duke was in command, the Russian army sent an expeditionary force through to Persia (now Iran) to link up with British troops. Also in 1916, the Russian army captured the Fortress of Erzerum, the port of Trebizond (now Trabzon) {{and the town of}} Erzincan. The Turks responded with an offensive of their own. Fighting around Lake Van <b>swung</b> <b>back</b> and forth, but ultimately proved inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-to-late 1980s, {{contemporary}} romances {{began to}} feature women in more male-dominated jobs, such as offshore oil rigs {{and the space}} program. By the early 1990s, the pendulum had <b>swung</b> <b>back</b> to feature heroines who were self-employed. The age range of heroines also began to expand, so that books began to feature women who had already reached 30 and even 40. Heroes also changed, with some authors veering towards a more sensitive man. Despite the broadening of {{some aspects of the}} plot, other taboos remained, and publishers discouraged authors from writing about controversial subjects such as terrorism, warfare, and masculine sports. Romance novels began to contain more humor beginning in the 1990s, as Julie Garwood began introducing a great deal of humor into her historical romances.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of the 20th century saw several {{attempts}} to deny the authorship and authenticity of the book, with scholars such as C.C. Torrey (1863–1956) and Morton Smith placing it variously in the 3rd century BCE and in the 8th/7th. The pendulum <b>swung</b> <b>back</b> in the post-war period, with an increasing acceptance of the book's essential unity and historical placement in the Exile. The most influential modern scholarly work on Ezekiel, Walther Zimmerli's two-volume commentary, appeared in German in 1969 and in English in 1979 and 1983. Zimmerli traces the process by which Ezekiel's oracles were delivered orally and transformed into a written text by the prophet and his followers through a process of ongoing re-writing and re-interpretation. He isolates the oracles and speeches behind the present text, and traces Ezekiel's interaction with a mass of mythological, legendary and literary material as he developed his insights into Yahweh's purposes during the period of destruction and exile.|$|E
60|$|The {{lady was}} {{deposited}} {{in her family}} vault, which, for three subsequent years, was undisturbed. At the expiration of this term it was opened for the reception of a sarcophagus;----but, alas! how fearful a shock awaited the husband, who, personally, threw open the door! As its portals <b>swung</b> outwardly <b>back,</b> some white-apparelled object fell rattling within his arms. It was the skeleton of his wife in her yet unmoulded shroud.|$|R
60|$|The {{wise man}} {{led the way}} {{straight}} to the middle gate of the seven, where there hung a horn of pure silver, which he set to his lips. He blew a blast so loud and shrill that it made Gebhart's ears tingle. In an instant there sounded a great rumble and grumble like the noise of loud thunder, and the gates of brass <b>swung</b> slowly <b>back,</b> as though of themselves.|$|R
50|$|However {{everything}} {{was all about}} to change, and in 1990 the Liberal Democrats seized the seat. John Hemming, who was later to become the MP for the Yardley constituency, won for the first time. The Liberal Democrats had won the ward at every election until 2011, when it <b>swung</b> strongly <b>back</b> to Labour. Labour gained a second seat in 2012, but the Liberal Democrats held their remaining seat in the 2014 elections.|$|R
25|$|Macmillan was {{overtaken}} by events when Butler leaked {{the details of}} the reshuffle to press baron Lord Rothermere over lunch on 11 July. The newspapers reported the impending changes on 12 July, and Macmillan made the decision to press ahead with the reshuffle at once. Lloyd was called to a meeting that evening and dismissed. The remaining six were informed the following day, 13 July. Macmillan faced sharp criticism over the scale of the changes, and his political opponents both within the Conservative Party and in the Opposition characterised him as ruthless and opportunistic. Despite an initial sharp drop in his approval ratings, opinion eventually <b>swung</b> <b>back</b> in his favour and the Party recovered. Macmillan regretted the way the reshuffle was carried out, and was particularly concerned about his treatment of Lloyd, who was a loyal confidant. Despite the dramatic changes in the Cabinet, the Conservatives were rocked by a series of scandals in 1963 and Macmillan retired in October of that year after being misdiagnosed with cancer. He was replaced as Prime Minister by Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who was defeated in the 1964 general election.|$|E
500|$|In 1947, {{a novice}} bell ringer {{died in an}} {{accident}} {{when he tried to}} move one of the bells while standing under it. [...] The bell <b>swung</b> <b>back</b> and hit him in the head, killing him instantly. [...] The bell was then [...] "punished" [...] by removing the clapper. In the following years, the bell was known as la castigada ("the punished one"), or la muda ("the mute one"). In 2000, the clapper was reinstalled in the bell.|$|E
500|$|The Sd.Kfz. 10/3 was {{equipped}} with a [...] tank and spray system to lay down poison gas barriers. The spray nozzle <b>swung</b> <b>back</b> and forth to cover a width of [...] Approximately 67 were built in 193839. On 15 April 1942 the Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres - OKH) ordered the tanks on the 65 vehicles in storage dismounted, the spray system disabled and the vehicles modified to carry 216 rounds of anti-tank ammunition. The vehicles were to be issued to rebuilding Nebeltruppen units. By {{this stage of the}} war they were equipped with Nebelwerfer rocket launchers and had organic anti-tank guns.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Sabin {{watched the}} {{construction}} of his tee, and swung his club lightly. [...] "Just a little sliced, wasn't it?" [...] he said. [...] "That will do, thanks." [...] He addressed his ball with a confidence which savoured almost of carelessness, <b>swung</b> easily <b>back</b> and drove a clean, hard hit ball full seventy yards further than the professional. The man for a moment was speechless with surprise, and he gave a little gasp.|$|R
60|$|The days dragged by {{with little}} excitement. Alora sought many {{means of escape}} but found none practical. Once, while Janet was {{unlocking}} the hall door to go to market, the girl made a sudden dash to get by her and so secure her freedom; but the woman caught her arm and <b>swung</b> her <b>back</b> so powerfully that Alora fell against the opposite wall, bruised and half stunned. She {{was no match for}} Janet in strength.|$|R
60|$|Two men {{brought the}} log, which was unusually long and heavy for that region, where the stoutest trees are small, and Boone and I {{staggered}} with {{the butt of}} it into the smoke. The rest grasped the thinner end, <b>swung</b> it <b>back,</b> and drove the other forward with all the impetus they could furnish. The door creaked, but the most manifest result was the fall of a further strip of burning thatch on us.|$|R
