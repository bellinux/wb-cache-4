50|$|Production of the GC2 was {{discontinued}} in 1995 so {{that the}} company could concentrate on production of its increasing range of quality <b>scope</b> <b>mounts</b> which were becoming widely known {{as some of the}} best <b>scope</b> <b>mounts</b> and rings in the world.|$|R
5000|$|However, in {{long range}} {{shooting}} tilted <b>scope</b> <b>mounts</b> are common {{since it is}} very important to have enough vertical adjustment to compensate for the bullet drop at longer distances.

5000|$|MSG3: A variant {{featuring}} the newer <b>scope</b> <b>mount</b> that is found on {{only a few}} of the Heckler & Koch rifles, as compared to the more conventional claw mounts, though the claw mounting points remain on the receiver. This newer <b>scope</b> <b>mount</b> does not allow the use of the open sights with the mount in place, as is the case with the more conventional claw mount.|$|E
50|$|The {{receiver}} housing has {{a proprietary}} claw-rail mounting system that permits the attachment {{of a standard}} Heckler & Koch quick-detachable <b>scope</b> <b>mount</b> (also used with the G3, HK33 and G3SG/1). It {{can be used to}} mount daytime optical sights (telescopic 4×24), night sights, reflex sights and laser pointers. The mount features two spring-actuated bolts, positioned along the base of the mount, which exert pressure on the receiver to hold the mount in the same position at all times assuring zero retention. All versions of the quick-detachable <b>scope</b> <b>mount</b> provide a sighting tunnel through the mount so that the shooter can continue to use the fixed iron sights with the <b>scope</b> <b>mount</b> attached {{to the top of the}} receiver.|$|E

5000|$|Combination {{guns are}} over/under designs, usually {{with a shotgun}} barrel over a rifle barrel. Iron sights are {{commonly}} used for aiming the rifle, and the front sight alone is sufficient to point the shotgun. <b>Scope</b> <b>mounts</b> are available, sometimes with a cutout for aiming the shotgun barrels. However, the thinness of the shotgun barrels that are usually on top make the <b>scope</b> <b>mounting</b> awkward.|$|R

5000|$|The AUG's {{receiver}} {{may also}} be changed from the standard model with a carrying handle and built-in 1.5× optical sight, to the [...] "T" [...] model receiver which has a universal <b>scope</b> <b>mount</b> {{to allow for the}} use of a variety of scopes and sights. The rifle also has several different types of receivers with Picatinny rails. It has proven to be an effective sniper or designated marksman rifle when configured with the 621 mm light machine gun barrel, the universal <b>scope</b> <b>mount</b> fitted with a Kahles ZF69 6×42 optical sight and the semi-auto-only trigger group.|$|E

50|$|The {{scope is}} mounted to the rifle using a SEI <b>scope</b> <b>mount</b> and ring package made via {{electrical}} discharge machining (EDM). The scopemount {{is attached to the}} rifle's stock and not welded to the receiver.|$|E
50|$|The M77 has {{undergone}} one minor and two major redesigns. The first change involved incorporating a proprietary <b>scope</b> <b>mount</b> milled integral with the receiver. The first rifles had simple rounded-top receivers {{drilled and tapped}} for separate scope mounts.|$|E

50|$|The Marlin Model 99 was {{developed}} in 1959 by Ewald Nichol. Internally, it was essentially {{what would become the}} Model 60 in 1960. However, major differences were visible from the exterior. The Model 99 featured a walnut stock, and the receiver, instead of being grooved for tip-off <b>scope</b> <b>mounts</b> like the Model 60 would be, was factory-tapped to accept screw-on <b>scope</b> <b>mounts.</b> The Model 99 was offered from 1959 through 1961, and a lower priced version, Model 99G, was offered under Marlin's Glenfield line.|$|R

50|$|Early Model 88s were {{equipped}} with a single slide rail, but this was updated to a dual slide rail in 1990. Also the Maverick 88 {{does not have a}} receiver top pre-drilled and tapped for a Weaver <b>scope</b> <b>mount</b> rail.|$|E
50|$|The carbine has a butt {{stock and}} forend made of either Brazilian {{hardwood}} or plastic {{and uses a}} fiber optic front sight. An optional Picatinny <b>scope</b> <b>mount</b> base allows the user to mount a sight {{on the top of}} the frame and a choke is included for turkey hunting.|$|E
50|$|The M82A2 {{differed}} from M82A1 mostly in its configuration; the pistol grip along with trigger was placed {{ahead of the}} magazine, and the buttpad placed below the receiver, just after the magazine. An additional forward grip was added below the receiver, and the <b>scope</b> <b>mount</b> was moved forward.|$|E
5000|$|The X-BOLT rifle is a bolt-action rifle. Its name {{come from}} [...] "X-Lock" [...] <b>Scope</b> <b>Mounting</b> System. In addition, it uses [...] "X-BOLT Feather Trigger" [...] which {{is able to}} {{adjustable}} trigger pull.|$|R
25|$|Other {{accessories}} such as <b>scope</b> <b>mounts,</b> Kobra optics and PBS1 sound suppressors {{were available}} due to it being largely {{derived from the}} AK-74/47 family, thus having the correct thread and AK optics side mount.|$|R
