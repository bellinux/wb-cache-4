Three separate simulations with relatively high mesh resolutions and different swirl numbers have been carried out using a finite volume method on a Cartesian non-uniform structured grid. A localised dynamic Smagorinsky model is used to parameterize the subgrid scale turbulence. The snapshots of the axial and swirl velocities and velocity vector fields show the complex flow patterns developing with increased <b>swirl</b> <b>number</b> and the rapid decay of axial momentum. Precessing vortex cores (PVC) were identified for all three cases and the mean axial velocity plots indicate that the upstream extremity of the vortex breakdown bubble shifts towards the inlet as the <b>swirl</b> <b>number</b> increases.

A total of 5 different <b>swirl</b> <b>numbers</b> S are investigated: one at zero swirl, one at low swirl (S = 0. 18), two at intermediate swirl (S = 0. 37 and 0. 57) and one at high swirl (S = 0. 74). The flow fields are measured using the stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV) technique. A detailed study on the accuracy of the PIV measurements is presented, including a validation with laser doppler anemometry (LDA) data. In this way a detailed set of accurate data is presented of the three components of velocity and the rms value of their fluctuations in a plane through the central axis of the geometry. Despite its simple geometry, the immediate flow field of an annular jet is very complex. The concentric central tube of the nozzle acts as a bluff body to the flow, thus creating a Central Recirculation Zone (CRZ) behind it.

40|$|Abstract: The {{characteristics}} of decaying swirling flows and forced convective heat transfer {{on the condition}} of turbulent flow in a narrow concentric annulus were simulated. The governing equations are solved numerically via a finite volume method. Uniform wall temperature at the inner wall and adiabatic wall at the outer wall are considered as thermal boundary conditions. Solutions for the axial and swirl velocity distributions and the Nusselt number are obtained for different values of the inlet <b>swirl</b> <b>number</b> and the Reynolds number. Simulations show that the inlet <b>swirl</b> <b>number</b> have great influences on the heat transfer characteristics. Under developed turbulent flow conditions, the increases of inlet <b>swirl</b> <b>number</b> will enhance the heat transfer. When the inlet <b>swirl</b> <b>number</b> increases it increases the axial velocity near the wall and reduces it at the mid-gap to achieve the conservation of mass due to the existence of secondary flows in the annulus due to centrifugal forces. The increase of the near-wall velocity, in turn, produces larger temperature gradients and higher heat transfer rate. The swirl velocity profiles decay gradually downstream as a result of friction which leads to damp the tangential velocity. The comparison between predicted and experimental data of average Nusselt numbers was found to be in good agreement...|$|E

The investigation is carried out for a Reynolds number of 2000, which marks the upper limit of the laminar flow behavior for unidirectional pipe flow.

Depending {{on the degree of}} mixture non-uniformity, the structure, amount of emissions and even flammability limits of a flame in this intermediate regime could be totally different from a premixed one. To investigate this effect on lean premixed combustion (LPM), a reduced scale swirl-stabilized burner is built and analyzed experimentally and numerically in premixed and two different partially premixed configurations.

Two turbulence models which are realizable k-e and standard k-? from RANS technique were chosen and applied as the closure model. Comparison of simulation results were done with the experimental evidence obtained from Sydney University database and it is found that both models show good performance in predicting the turbulent swirl flame near the vicinity of the burner exit plane. However, due to isotropic nature of the two-eddy viscosity model, turbulent swirl flows farther downstream were not accurately captured. Parametric studies on the effects of fuel jet velocity and <b>swirl</b> <b>number</b> on the swirl flame structure were done. Simulation of turbulent unconfined swirl flames shows that the structure of the swirl flames is consists of outer and inner recirculation zones. The outer recirculation zone occurs due to the bluff-body effect; meanwhile the inner recirculation zone occurs farther downstream due to reversed flow. For fuel jet velocity, an increase in the velocity causes suspension of the occurrence of secondary recirculation zone. In this case, for higher fuel jet velocity, longer time is required for the fuel jet to decay and recirculation zone to form. In addition to that, the flame height increases with increasing fuel jet velocity. On the other hand, an increase in <b>swirl</b> <b>number</b> causes an increase in flame width and flame height. Results from the simulation have also shown that for low <b>swirl</b> <b>number</b> of 0. 3, recirculation zones were absent.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experimental}} work is to study lean premixed fuel/air swirl flames {{in order to identify}} the factors governing flame stabilization. The experimental burner is composed of a cylindrical quartz combustion chamber (200 ´ 80 mm) placed in a pressurized and cooled casing with three large optical accesses. Downstream, a converging nozzle with variable section allows to rise the pressure inside the combustion chamber up to 8 Bar. The combustion air can be preheated up to 500 °C. The fuel/air injector is a radial swirler injector. The premix tube is a 70 mm length and 10 mm diameter cylinder. The experimental device can operate either with natural gas or with liquid n-heptane, since liquid fuel prevaporization is to be studied in a second step. Results of the present study only concern natural gas combustion. Velocity field is measured by LDV technique, reacting zone is visualized by CH chemiluminescence imaging, mixing in the non reacting zone is qualified by acetone-PLIF, and dynamic pressure sensors are used. For the two tested <b>swirl</b> <b>numbers</b> and for a fixed inlet velocity, a Corner Recirculation Zone (CRZ) can be observed in LDV results for the non reacting flow. However the Inner Recirculation Zone (IRZ) appears only for high <b>swirl</b> <b>numbers.</b> For atmospheric pressure and Tinlet air = 20 °C, a lifted flame with an unstable position is observed. The IRZ strongly decreases lift height and extends burner lean operating limit. When equivalence ratio is decreased, instability intensity increases and a frequency appears at 240 Hz in pressure spectrum. A cyclic evolution along pressure cycle is observed for the structure and the reaction intensity of flame foot...|$|R
