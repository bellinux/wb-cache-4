5|$|Apart {{from the}} passing of noble titles or ranks, {{inheritance}} practices did not involve primogeniture; each son received an equal share of the family property. Unlike the practice in later dynasties, the father usually sent his adult married sons away with their portions of the family fortune. Daughters received {{a portion of the}} family fortune through their marriage dowries, though this was usually much less than the shares of sons. A different distribution of the remainder could be <b>specified</b> <b>in</b> a will, but it is unclear how common this was.|$|E

Columbia Records, Davis' American record label, had difficulty identifying the compositions for royalty purposes, and {{the album was}} not released in the United States until 1997. Critics were generally positive toward Black Beauty, although some were critical of its sound quality and Grossman's solos; Corea said the recording was an accurate document how that particular band of Davis' played live.|$|E

5|$|Network {{synthesis}} filters. The mathematical {{bases of}} network synthesis were {{laid in the}} 1930s and 1940s. After the end of World War II network synthesis became the primary tool of filter design. Network synthesis put filter design on a firm mathematical foundation, freeing it from the mathematically sloppy techniques of image design and severing the connection with physical lines. The essence of network synthesis is that it produces a design that will (at least if implemented with ideal components) accurately reproduce the response originally <b>specified</b> <b>in</b> black box terms.|$|E
