40|$|Many {{groups and}} {{individuals}} are involved in decision making for the allocation of the salmon resource. A comprehensive study of the economics of <b>salmon</b> <b>ranching</b> in New Zealand has not previously been undertaken. Before informed decisions can be made, such a study is essential. In this project, the economic potential of <b>salmon</b> <b>ranching</b> is examined, and the major variables that influence the economic return are identified. Preliminary to the economic analysis, the features of commercial <b>salmon</b> <b>ranching</b> in New Zealand are outlined. Quinnat salmon biology is described, and the environmental parameters that influence the operation of a salmon ranch are discussed. The history of commercial harvesting of salmon in New Zealand is detailed, along with the influence of salmon anglers on ranching policy. Local and export markets for salmon are examined for each product category, and the prospects in the major markets are assessed. A simulation model that incorporates the important linkages between biological and economic variables is developed. The model is {{used to determine the}} net benefits to the nation from operating a salmon ranch. Subsequently, the sensitivity of economic return to the biological and economic variables is tested. Finally, the model is used to evaluate the effect of three aspects of salmon management policy on economic return, namely; ranch location, other forms of salmon aquaculture, and disposal of salmon caught at sea. Results show that <b>salmon</b> <b>ranching</b> can yield an "acceptable" economic return to the nation under certain conditions. Economic return is found to be most sensitive to the biological variables of hatchery carrying capacity, hatchery mortality, and survival of released salmon. Market price and feed costs are identified as the most significant of the economic variables. Ranch location is revealed to be a crucial factor in determining the economic return from <b>salmon</b> <b>ranching.</b> Taking these results into account, the characteristics of a <b>salmon</b> <b>ranching</b> investment are examined and found to diverge significantly from alternative investments. From this, it is concluded that unless salmon ranches can be located at or near river mouths, development of a <b>salmon</b> <b>ranching</b> industry that also enhances the sports fishery is unlikely to occur...|$|E

This paper models the behavior of a dominant salmon rancher facing a competitive open-access fishery using a dynamic nonlinear programming model.

40|$|The present {{project is}} {{launched}} within {{the frame of}} a 7 year government funded programme to establish an additional livelihood for the coastal regions. The aim of the study is, through controlled experiments, to find ecologically and genetically sound release and recapture methods for <b>salmon</b> <b>ranching.</b> The coastal ranching model is based on releases from small coastal watercourses indepent large rivers with natural salmon stocks. The first releases were made in May- June 1991, when around 50 000 tagged smolts originating from three regional rivers were released in the Selstøvågen from the Selstø hatchery. The only fresh waters draining into the bay are the hatchery effluents amounting to about 2 m^ 3 min^- 1. Prior to release the fish were acclimatized to sea water in net pens. During release the fish were surveyed by divers with underwater- video, a SIMRAD EK 500 split-beam echo sounder and fisheries sonar. Hydrography and meteorology was monitored, test fishing for predators and smolts were undertaken. The results indicate rapid westward migration of smolts and 0. 1 % loss of fish to predators, thus supporting the assumption that predation is a less important cause for postsmolt mortality in the marine environment...|$|E

40|$|World {{harvest of}} salmon (Oncorhynchus spp. and Salmo salar) still comes mostly from {{naturally}} produced fish, but the contribution from aquaculture is substantial {{and continues to}} grow rapidly. There is a strong likelihood that aquaculture production will exceed natural production before the year 2000. Two types of aquaculture production, 2 ̆ 7 ranching 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 farming, 2 ̆ 7 are differentiated. Ranched salmon are released as juveniles into natural waters and harvested as maturing adults by sport and commercial fishers or at recapture facilities. Farmed salmon are held in captivity to harvest size. Ranching contributes a much larger biomass of salmon to today 2 ̆ 7 s world markets than farming, but the value of farmed salmon relative to ranched salmon {{is much greater than}} production levels indicate because species produced by farming are mostly of higher value than species produced by ranching. Innovations in technology show promise for continued reduction in cost of producing ranched and farmed <b>salmon.</b> <b>Ranching</b> and farming applications are becoming more diversified because of innovations. Salmon are expected to become more price-competitive with other types of animal protein. Recognized advantages for human health make farmed and ranched salmon attractive commodities for international trade. Several environmental and social issues have emerged as a consequences of rapid growth of salmon aquaculture. Institutional barriers to salmon aquaculture typically result because environmental impacts have adverse implications for production and management of natural stocks of salmon. Other factors contributing to policies adverse to growth of aquaculture include concerns of commercial salmon fishers over rights to harvest stocks and competition for markets...|$|E
40|$|With {{economic}} development and increased demand for high price fish, industrial scale marine finfish culture in Japan was started in 1960 - 1965 for yellowtail Seriola quinqueradiata. Sustainable supply of wild juvenile and development of floating cage with synthetic fiber net have spurred the culture of nearly 30 species and total production in 1991 is 265 x 103 metric tons (nearly 25 % of total aquaculture production). Although <b>salmon</b> <b>ranching</b> had been started in 1888, a national project of ocean ranching was only initiated in 1963 with the present target of 26 species of marine finfish. Ocean ranching aims to increase fisheries resources in coastal sea by stocking hatchery-reared juveniles and preservation of environmental capacity and habitat. Therefore, mass production of marine finfish juveniles is being done for the intensive culture in net cage and for stocking coastal sea in Japan. Nearly 200 million juveniles are produced by ocean ranching centers (14 national, 49 prefectural, 21 city and town, 53 fishermen's association). The number of target fish is about 60 species (excluding salmon and trout). The main species produced are red sea bream, Pagrus major, flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus, puffer, Takifugu rubrapes, rockfish, Sebastes shlegeli, and mud dab, Limanda yokohamae. More than one million juveniles of these species are produced at one hatchery or ocean ranching center per one fry production season. About 70 % of total production of juveniles consist of red sea bream and flounder. Red sea bream {{could be used to}} introduce mass larval rearing technology in Japan since its mass production is well developed. The focus of the present paper is the present status and short history of the development in larval rearing technology for red sea bream...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{of more than}} twenty-six thousand micro-tag recoveries has led to important discoveries {{for the management of}} Irish salmon stocks. This Leaflet gives details of the tagging over half a million young salmon and of the results of recovering 4, 000 tags from 1986 to 1988. The most important conclusions are: Careful control of place and time of release of hatchery-reared smolts has a dramatic effect on their survival. In the Corrib system, transportation of smolts from Cong to Galway resulted in a substantial improvement in yield, with a tenfold increase on one occasion. This means that up to ten times as many salmon can be produced at no increase in the cost of rearing them. The returning adult salmon produced from smolts which were released at Galway tended to stay for a long time below the Galway weir and therefore made a major contribution to the rod fishery. Marine survival fluctuated yearly for hatchery and wild smolts released. For hatchery smolts those released later survived best. In contrast wild smolts which migrated in May had a lower survival than those which left in April. Marked differences in homing accuracy, timing and speed of migration were noted between wild and hatchery smolts within the Corrib system. Drift net fisheries depend mainly on the salmon which originate from rivers nearby. There is a distinct division between the catches north and south of Galway Bay: those to the south come mostly from the rivers Shannon and Corrib, those to the north from Connemara rivers. The drift net fishery continues to rely heavily on a self sustaining population of wild salmon despite improved hatchery performance and increasing catch of cage farm escapees. Hatchery smolts transferred to different rivers learned to recognise the new river within a remarkably short time. Two weeks were sufficient to achieve a degree of homing success approaching that of fish returning to their own rivers. This discovery is of major significance in the development of <b>salmon</b> <b>ranching...</b>|$|E

40|$|Sea lice {{infestation}} as {{a source}} of marine mortality of outwardly migrating Atlantic salmon smolts has been investigated by treating groups of <b>ranched</b> <b>salmon,</b> prior to release, with a prophylactic sea lice treatment conferring protection from sea lice infestation. A number of studies have been carried out in Ireland using both established ranched populations and groups of hatchery reared fish imprinted for 5 – 8 weeks in the sites of experimental releases. In this study, data on 352 142 migrating salmon from twenty-eight releases, at eight locations along Ireland's South and West coasts covering a 9 -year period (2001 to 2009) are reviewed. Both published and new data are presented including a previously unpublished time series. The results of a meta-analysis of the combined data suggest that while sea lice-induced mortality on outwardly migrating smolts can be significant, it is a minor and irregular component of marine mortality in the stocks studied and is unlikely to be a significant factor influencing conservation status of salmon stocks.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Salmon {{management}} {{philosophies of}} the five salmon jurisdictions of the North Pacific (Japan, Russia, Canada, Alaska and the American Northwest) are examined in a historical and geographic context. The first objective {{is to provide a}} synthesis of salmon management experience across the North Pacific, to serve as a context for the professionals and private citizens involved in day-to-day salmon management. The second objective is to elucidate the relative role of geography versus deliberate management action in shaping contemporary salmon management philosophies, on the basis of salmon management experience. Harvest trends, species composition, regulatory actions, property rights, technological innovation, climate variability, habitat alteration, markets, international agreements, and science are reviewed for each jurisdiction over time. The source material is drawn from a variety of scholarly and popular published sources, in Russian and English. The inferred salmon management philosophies {{of the five}} jurisdictions vary in their emphasis on three primary salmon management objectives: maximizing biomass production, preserving salmon harvest communities, and conserving salmonid genetic and life history diversity. All initially heavily emphasized biomass production, except for Canada. Only Japan, and Alaska after statehood, have given moderate or great emphasis to community preservation. Among the five jurisdictions, the only two to emphasize biodiversity conservation are the Pacific Northwest United States and British Columbia, Canada. The initial species endowment of each jurisdiction, the landscape, climate variability and the cultural heritage of the dominant salmon harvesters are more critical at shaping salmon management philosophies than are incremental regulatory decisions over time. For instance, Japan's <b>salmon</b> <b>ranching</b> philosophy accrued from the availability of species without freshwater life history stages and the need to support a large human population. Favorable climate conditions in the 1970 s facilitated the Japanese emphasis on hatchery chums and an engineering approach to contend with flooding and the demand for energy and water supplies. Change in salmon management philosophies, such as the shift to an emphasis on biodiversity conservation in British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest, occurs when the legal harvest rights of salmon harvester subgroups changes during a period of harvest decline. In the case of the latter two jurisdictions, the increased legal rights of native peoples have catalyzed a shift from an emphasis on biomass production to biodiversity conservation...|$|E

40|$|The {{relations}} between smoking parameters and {{the characteristics of}} salmon raw material were investigated with respect to yield, colour, flesh content of phenol and salt, and sensory properties. The fish studied were ocean <b>ranched</b> <b>salmon</b> harvested in Iceland in July 1998 and farmed salmon from Norway slaughtered in October 1998 and April 1999. Seven treatments were applied on fresh or frozen raw material combining dry or brine salting with cold smoking at 20 or 30 C. Electrostatic smoking was tested on dry-salted salmon fillets. The results show a lower yield after filleting and trimming with ocean ranched fish. Although freezing {{had little effect on}} yield, total loss was slightly greater, especially for fish with low fat content. Sensory differences were also apparent. The brine salting technique resulted in lower losses. Fish with higher fat content gave a better yield after processing, although careful control of the smoking procedure was required (especially at 30 C) to avoid a case-hardening effect. With brine salting, salt uptake was higher for smaller, leaner fish. The phenol content of flesh depended on the technique and/or smoking temperature used, regardless of the fish studied. However, for a smoking temperature of 30 C, the flesh of smaller, leaner fish showed a higher phenol level. Smoking conditions and preliminary treatment such as freezing produced similar differences in sensory characteristics, regardless o...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} salmon lice on the {{survival}} of migrating Atlantic salmon smolts was studied by comparing the adult returns of sea-ranched smolts treated for sea lice using emamectin benzoate or substance EX with untreated control groups in the River Dale in western Norway. A total of 143500 smolts were released in 35 release groups in freshwater from 1997 to 2009 and in the fjord system from 2007 to 2009. The adult recaptures declined gradually with release year and reached minimum levels in 2007. This development corresponded with poor marine growth and increased age at maturity of <b>ranched</b> <b>salmon</b> and in three monitored salmon populations and indicated unfavourable conditions in the Norwegian Sea. The recapture rate of treated smolts {{was significantly higher than}} the controls in three of the releases performed: the only release in 1997, one of three in 2002 and the only group released in sea water in 2007. The effect of treating the smolts against salmon lice was smaller than the variability in return rates between release groups, and much smaller that variability between release years, but its overall contribution was still significant (P< 0. 05) and equivalent to an odds ratio of the probability of being recaptured of 1. 17 in favour of the treated smolts. Control fish also tended to be smaller as grilse (P= 0. 057), possibly due to a sublethal effect of salmon lice...|$|R
