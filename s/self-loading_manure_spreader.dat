The travel speed of each application pass was not constant, and the variation ranged from 0. 9 - 1. 6 m/s. The standard deviation of an individual track distance did not significantly change. However, there was a maximum change of 2. 5 m between each track distance in the test field. The results show the differences in compost application rate are due to the changes in travel speeds and track distances. [URL]...|$|R

Many of these ground-driven spreaders are still produced today, mostly {{in the form of}} small units that can be pulled behind a larger garden tractor or an all terrain vehicle (ATV). In recent years hydraulic and PTO driven units have been developed to offer variable application rates. Several models are also designed with removable rotating mechanisms (beaters), attachable side extensions, and tailgates for hauling chopped forages, cereal grains, and other crops.A typical (modern) <b>manure</b> <b>spreader</b> consists of a trailer towed behind a tractor with a rotating mechanism driven by the tractor's power take off (PTO).|$|R

50|$|On October 18, 1899, Oppenheim broke {{ground for}} a small shop in Maria Stein, Ohio, where he could produce his new <b>manure</b> <b>spreader,</b> {{incorporating}} the “widespread” paddle device in addition to two beaters. Among the first employees he hired at the shop were Fred Heckman and Henry Synck. Synck, who later married one of Joseph’s daughters, Wilhelmina, was said by contemporaries to have had “a genius for machinery and mechanics of all kinds.” and “in 1899 he entered the employ of Oppenheim and gradually familiarized himself with the technique of the business.”. Neighbors around the town of Maria Stein started referring to the widespread <b>manure</b> <b>spreaders</b> as “Oppenheim’s new idea” and Joseph adopted this as the name for the business.|$|R
40|$|For {{the farming}} {{industry}} {{it is essential}} to use liquid manure as natural fertilizer. Through new agricultural regulation 2015 in Germany the industry must develop new liquid <b>manure</b> <b>spreader</b> systems because the ammonia and methane emission are limited. In a research project the University of Applied Sciences Zwickau and some other industry partners will develop such a new innovative liquid <b>manure</b> <b>spreader.</b> The new liquid <b>manure</b> <b>spreader</b> should use pulsating air to distribute the liquid manure exactly. The pulsating air, which flows through the pipelines, should be analysed at a test station. For examinations at this test station it is important to find another substitute fluid because liquid manure smells strong, is not transparent and is also not homogeneous enough for scientific investigations. Furthermore it is important to ensure that the substitute fluid is, like liquid manure, a non-Newtonian fluid. The substitute fluid must be a shear-thinning substance - this means the viscosity decrease at higher shear rate. Many different samples like soap-water-farragoes, jelly-water-farragoes, agar-water-farragoes, soap-ethanol-farragoes and more are, for the project, examined in regard of their physical properties to find the best substitute fluid. The samples are examined at the rotational viscometer for viscosity at various shear rates and then compared with the viscosity values of liquid manure...|$|R

50|$|Joseph Oppenheim (March 1, 1859 - November 24, 1901) was an {{educator}} {{who invented the}} modern widespread <b>manure</b> <b>spreader</b> that made farming less labor-intensive and far more efficient in the early 20th century, and only he is honored for that invention in the Ohio Agricultural Hall of Fame in Columbus, Ohio.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the farming}} {{communities}} of Ohio, fertilization of fields was possible {{only by the}} distribution of animal excrement, usually mixed with bedding straw to create a semi-solid mixture of manure. The task of shoveling and distributing the manure was backbreaking {{and there were many}} attempts made to mechanize this process. One such example was a patent by a Daniel Merrell in 1886 for a mechanized [...] "manure spreader". [...] There were a number of other patent filings prior to the onset of the 20th century. In 1899 John M Kramer, Fred Heckman and Henry Synck, Jr., all of whom lived in the small farming community of Maria Stein, OH were awarded a patent for a device to spread manure which they named a [...] "manure distributor". Synck subsequently worked with his future father-in-law, Joseph Oppenheim, to develop the first practical <b>manure</b> <b>spreader.</b> Oppenheim's 1900 invention was so successful that it spawned a major manufacturing company, the New Idea Spreader Works, later renamed the New Idea Farm Machinery Company in 1899. New Idea celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1999 as a division of AGCO. Synck's role in the evolution of <b>manure</b> <b>spreader</b> and other farm machinery technology is well documented by a steady stream of patents that not only describe improvements to the <b>manure</b> <b>spreader,</b> but also other farm machinery from 1899 to 1939.|$|R

On July 1, 1907, the New Idea Spreader Company, while maintaining operations at Maria Stein, opened a factory in nearby Coldwater, Ohio where it had the advantage of two railroads on which it could ship the spreaders. [...] In 1912, all operations were moved to a new 220000 sq ft factory on twenty acres in Coldwater with all machinery driven by electricity. By 1916 the New Idea Spreader Company had branches in eight states and an assembly plant in Guelph, Ontario. “The net assets of the firm were over one million dollars with total sales for that year of $1,250,000.” [...] Eight years later, in 1924, the factory was turning out 125 <b>manure</b> <b>spreaders</b> in an eight-hour day and had a profit of two million dollars.|$|R

[...] He noted that [...] "when a player held the paddle-shaped bat at an angle, a foul ball resulted, with the ball careening off at the angle dictated by the paddle. Why not, pondered Oppenheim, make manure do the same thing - fly out at an angle from a series of paddles?" [...] Earlier patent ideas, including that described by Kramer, Heckman and Synck (above) had a distributive mechanism that was flawed in that the width of distribution was relatively narrow. Oppenheim subsequently developed a model from a cigar box and demonstrated the feasibility of distributing manure in a [...] "wide spread pattern". Oppenheim's patent clearly describes the distribution mechanism Manure was loaded into the spreader. A mechanism moved the manure to the rear where it was distributed by paddles.|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} size of farm equipment, {{the potential for}} soil compaction has become a real problem. According to some grain farmers, compaction from manure spreading equipment is a factor limiting their acceptance of slurry as a soil building and soil fertility resource. To {{address the issue of}} compaction caused by <b>manure</b> <b>spreaders,</b> eight on-farm sites were set up in the fall of 2004 and spring of 2005. At each site three treatments were applied (manure, farmer’s check, and tanker compaction only), and replicated three times. In addition to the on-farm trials, an on-station site was set up in Arlington. The on-station site examined the impact of multiple passes of heavy slurry equipment as might occur on field roads or headlands. After one year of field trials, it appears that compaction from <b>manure</b> <b>spreaders</b> does not adversely affect corn yields when it is applied in reasonably dry conditions. There {{was no significant difference between}} the three treatments in seven of the eight on-farm sites. Despite non-significant differences at the plot scale, hand harvests of the on-station trial showed a 10 to 15 % reduction in corn yield for rows that were directly within the tire track when there were multiple passes...|$|R
