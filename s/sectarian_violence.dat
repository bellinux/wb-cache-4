5|$|Since 2002, {{the country}} has seen <b>sectarian</b> <b>violence</b> by Boko Haram, an Islamist {{movement}} that seeks to abolish the secular system of government and establish Sharia law in the country. In the 2010 Jos riots, more than 500 people were killed by religious violence.|$|E
5|$|Boycott {{himself said}} {{that he did not want}} such a large number of Ulstermen, as he had saved the grain harvest himself, and that only ten or fifteen labourers were needed to save the root crops. He feared that a large number of Ulstermen would lead to <b>sectarian</b> <b>violence.</b> While local Land League leaders said that there would be no trouble from them if the aim was simply to harvest the crops, more extreme {{sections}} of the local population did threaten violence against the expedition and the troops.|$|E
5|$|When the British 6th Airborne Division {{arrived in}} {{response}} to increasing terrorist activity, it became involved in internal security, being responsible for cordons and search operations, guarding convoys and key installations. As the situation worsened, {{the men of the}} division had to patrol the towns and cities, enforce curfews and deal with rioting by the civilian population. They also protected Jewish and Arab settlements from <b>sectarian</b> <b>violence.</b> This was not without loss to the division and several members were killed and wounded during this time.|$|E

5|$|The only UEFA European Fixture to {{take place}} at Prenton Park was a UEFA Cup first {{qualifying}} round tie between Irish team Shelbourne and Scottish team Rangers, on 22 July 1998. Due to fears of <b>sectarian</b> <b>violence,</b> and after discussions between the two clubs and UEFA, Prenton Park {{was chosen as the}} venue for the first leg, with Shelbourne as the home team. The match finished 3–5 in favour of Rangers after Shelbourne (at the time a semi-professional side) had earlier taken a 3–0 lead. As a result of this game, Rangers were fined 25,000 Swiss Francs and warned by UEFA for their fans' behaviour at the game.|$|E
5|$|The film brings {{together}} the video diaries recorded by four friends and {{students at the}} Tariq bin Ziad High School for Boys in Zayouna, a mixed-race, middle-class area in the Karrada suburb of Baghdad, Iraq. Entering their final year in 2006, each has high expectations for the year ahead and hope to graduate so {{they can have a}} chance to attend university. At the same time, the boys must also deal with the increasing <b>sectarian</b> <b>violence</b> that is starting to extend into Karrada. They face the threats of roadside bombings, the hassles of security checkpoints on their way to school, frequent curfews, the constant presence of American Apache helicopters overhead, and the deterioration of their neighbourhood which becomes rife with assassinations, muggings and kidnappings. Many of their fellow students, unmotivated and academically underperforming, are absent from school.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{was present}} during the 1947 Partition of India into the Dominion of Pakistan and the Union of India and the {{accompanying}} ethnic violence between Hindu and Muslim communities. He was unhappy with how these events had affected the Archaeological Survey, complaining {{that some of his}} finest students and staff were now citizens of Pakistan and no longer able to work for him. He was based in New Delhi when the city was rocked by <b>sectarian</b> <b>violence,</b> and attempted to help many of his Muslim staff members escape from the Hindu-majority city unharmed. He further helped smuggle Muslim families out of the city hospital, where they had taken refuge from a violent Hindu mob. As India neared independence from the British Empire, the political situation had changed significantly; by October 1947 {{he was one of the}} last British individuals in a high-up position within the country's governing establishment, and recognised that many Indian nationalists wanted him to also leave.|$|E

Enab Baladi succeeded in providing the Syrian people with trusted information about events in Syria through its weekly newspaper. EB coverage included the human rights violations perpetrated by the Syrian regime, as well as the inception of the nascent Syrian civil society, in addition to various news and topics in the fields of politics, economy, and social affairs.|$|R
5|$|In the mid-1870s, the Straits Governor, William Jervois {{contemplated}} on placing Maharaja Abu Bakar as the overlord of {{the chiefs}} in Negeri Sembilan after the British failed {{to quell the}} <b>sectarian</b> <b>violence</b> in Sungai Ujong. Abu Bakar's client, Tunku Antah was placed as the Yam Tuan of the Sri Menanti confederacy (comprising several small states within the region), and Abu Bakar was made the adviser of Negeri Sembilan (except Sungai Ujong) in 1878. Abu Bakar was believed to have nursed expansionist ambitions, which was suggested by {{his involvement in the}} Pahang Civil War between 1857 and 1864. A later governor, Frederick Weld, aspired for stronger British control over the Malay states and was weary of Abu Bakar's influence. The chiefs were lukewarm to the prospect of Johor's sphere of influence over Negeri Sembilan, and in 1881 Weld convinced the chiefs within the Sri Menanti confederacy to deal directly with Singapore rather than with Abu Bakar. British officers were also appointed to oversee the affairs in 1883 and 1887, and were gradually given the powers similar to that of a British resident.|$|E
5|$|There is no state-prescribed {{religion}} in the country. The religious groups in the urban centre of Bangui, {{in the order of}} their population representation, are the Christians which form the majority, Animists following ancient beliefs, and Muslims. The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception under the Roman Catholic Metropolitan Archdiocese of Bangui is located in Bangui, as is the Church of Fatima. The archdiocese was established as the Apostolic Prefecture of Oubangui Chari on 8 May 1909. Pope John Paul II visited Bangui in August 1985. The seat of the archbishop is Notre-Dame Cathedral in Bangui. Islam is the last in the order of religious beliefs with about 20,000 Muslims in Bangui. However, prior to <b>sectarian</b> <b>violence</b> in the country, more than 100,000 Muslims lived in the capital. The late president Bokassa converted to Islam as a political compulsion under the guidance of the then Libyan President Gaddafi. He also assumed the Muslim name of Sala Eddine Ahmed Bou Kassa, but it was short-lived as he wanted a cathedral to be built in Bangui. The Church of Fatima and Notre Dame D'Afrique are located in KM 5.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction. Research {{on social}} ecologies of {{political}} violence has been largely confined to cross-sectional tests of the impact {{of political violence}} on child adjustment, limiting perspectives on more nuanced causal pathways, including tests of reciprocal relations between child adjustment and political violence. Based on a four-wave longitudinal design, this study breaks new ground in assessing bidirectional relations between <b>sectarian</b> community <b>violence</b> and children’s adjustment problems. Method. The study included 999 mother-child dyads selected from working class neighborhoods in Belfast ranked in the bottom quartile in terms of social deprivation in Northern Ireland, with approximately 35 - 40 families recruited to participate from each neighborhood. Across the four waves of data collected in consecutive years, child participants (52 % female) were 12. 18 (SD= 1. 82), 13. 24 (SD= 1. 83), 13. 62 (SD= 1. 99), and 14. 66 (SD= 1. 96) years old. Data Analysis. Cross-lagged path models were tested through R package lavaan with full information maximum likelihood. Results. Children’s exposure to sectarian antisocial behavior in their community related to greater adjustment problems one year later. Reflecting a reciprocal pathway, children’s adjustment problems also related to their report of exposure to sectarian antisocial behavior in their community one year later. Based on separate analyses as a function of child gender, both pathways were found to hold true for boys. However, contrary to predictions, girl’s adjustment problems were related to their greater exposure to <b>sectarian</b> community <b>violence</b> but not the other way around. Discussion. These findings offer promising directions towards better conceptualizations of dynamic relations between political violence and child adjustment over time. Keywords: political violence, child and adolescent adjustment, bidirectional pathways, community violence, gender difference...|$|R

25|$|Khalilzad {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{high-level}} Administration officials to warn that <b>sectarian</b> <b>violence</b> was overtaking the insurgency as the number one threat to Iraq's stability. After the Al Askari shrine bombing, in February 2006, he warned that spreading <b>sectarian</b> <b>violence</b> might lead to civil war – and possibly even a broader conflict involving neighboring countries. Khalilzad sought political solutions to the problem of sectarianism, in particular working to integrate the balance of power between Iraq's three main ethnic groups in order to head off growing Sunni violence.|$|E
25|$|Shias allege {{discrimination}} by the Pakistani government since 1948, claiming that Sunnis are given preference in business, official positions and administration of justice. Attacks on Shias increased under {{the presidency of}} Zia-ul-Haq, with the first major sectarian riots in Pakistan breaking out in 1983 in Karachi and later spreading to Lahore and Balochistan. <b>Sectarian</b> <b>violence</b> became a recurring feature of the Muharram month every year, with <b>sectarian</b> <b>violence</b> between Sunnis and Shias taking place in 1986 in Parachinar. In one notorious incident, the 1988 Gilgit Massacre, Osama bin Laden-led Sunni tribals assaulted, massacred and raped Shia civilians in Gilgit after being inducted by the Pakistan Army to quell a Shia uprising in Gilgit.|$|E
40|$|The {{connection}} between religion, politics and {{violence is a}} controversial and pressing concern {{in the life of}} the subcontinent. This study attempts to unpick some of these linkages by means of a series of detailed historical case studies that cover the period from 1947 until 2002. The contributions from both leading experts and research students provide important comparative insights into <b>sectarian</b> and communal <b>violence</b> in India and Pakistan...|$|R

He has also written research reports for international think tanks, including the Jamestown Foundation and the Norwegian Peacebuilding Resource Center (NOREF) and Central Asia Online.|$|R
50|$|Belfast North {{contains}} 14 wards of Belfast City Council and 5 of Newtownabbey Borough Council. The constituency {{suffered the}} highest level of violence in Northern Ireland during The Troubles and covers many areas synonymous with the conflict - the New Lodge, Ardoyne, Rathcoole, Ballysillan and Woodvale. The overall tenor of the constituency is working-class, with a high proportion of residents in public housing, and concentrations of low-income single people in the middle Antrim Road and Cliftonville areas. There are some upscale residential areas around Belfast Castle and on the slopes of Cavehill. Sectarian divisions are stark, with a number of Peace lines cutting through the constituency and occasional outbursts of <b>sectarian</b> street <b>violence,</b> and was the focus for post-ceasefire incidents such as the Holy Cross dispute.|$|R

50|$|Since the 16th century {{there has}} been sectarian {{conflict}} of varying intensity between Roman Catholics and Protestants in Ireland. This religious sectarianism is connected to a degree with nationalism. Northern Ireland has seen inter-communal conflict {{for more than four}} centuries and there are records of religious ministers or clerics, the agents for absentee landlords, aspiring politicians, and members of the landed gentry stirring up and capitalizing on <b>sectarian</b> hatred and <b>violence</b> back as far as the late 18th century.|$|R
50|$|Ireland {{would have}} a {{significant}} role to play in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Throughout the realms under the Stuart monarchy, sectarian tensions bubbled away as the Crown attempted to erect Episcopalianism as the state religion. For Ireland, the tensions were doubled due to the specter of land-dispossession (continued under the Earl of Stafford) and the push to Anglicisation. Irish Catholics pressed for civil liberties known as The Graces: Stafford said they would be delivered if the Irish helped to suppress the Covenanters in Scotland during the Bishops Wars (enraging the English and Scottish Parliaments). The situation came to ahead when the Irish Catholic gentry under Féilim Ó Néill attempted a desperate coup d'état with the Irish Rebellion of 1641. The rebellion was betrayed by spies and Ireland descended into chaos, including <b>sectarian</b> communal <b>violence,</b> until the Irish Confederation was established.|$|R
