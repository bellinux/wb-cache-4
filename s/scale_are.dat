5|$|According to French Senate's Comité des Prix de Revient des {{fabrications}} d'Armement (CPRA) {{cited by}} the daily La Tribune, {{the total cost of}} the AASM program including development costs and the delivery of 2348 kits is €846m. On that basis the per-weapon cost is $300,000 or twelve times the cost of the comparable American JDAM, although the latter has been manufactured in much larger quantities (~250,000 kits) and would be reasonable to expect a drastic reduction of the price of the French munition if larger contracts are signed and economies of <b>scale</b> <b>are</b> achieved.|$|E
5|$|Scales, more specifically, mostly {{consist of}} hard beta keratins which are {{basically}} transparent. The colours of the <b>scale</b> <b>are</b> due to pigments {{in the inner}} layers of the skin and not due to the scale material itself. Scales are hued for all colours in this manner except for blue and green. Blue {{is caused by the}} ultrastructure of the scales. By itself, such a scale surface diffracts light and gives a blue hue, while, in combination with yellow from the inner skin it gives a beautiful iridescent green.|$|E
5|$|Van Eyck's {{earlier work}} often shows churches and cathedrals in older Romanesque style, {{sometimes}} {{to represent the}} Temple in Jerusalem as an appropriate historical setting, with decoration drawn exclusively from the Old Testament. That is clearly not the case here – the Christ Child occupies the same space as a large rood cross depicting him being crucified. The church in this panel is contemporary Gothic – a choice perhaps intended to associate Mary with the Ecclesia Triumphans – while her pose and oversized <b>scale</b> <b>are</b> indebted to the forms and conventions of Byzantine art and the International Gothic. Van Eyck details the architecture with a precision not seen before in northern European painting.|$|E
50|$|The {{scales of}} the rainbow fish were red, blue, green, and yellow. The green <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> made of grass, {{representing}} the element Earth. The blue <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> ice, which represented water: the second element. The yellow <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> lightning, representing air. The red <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> made of fire, representing the fourth element. The four elements that made up The Rainbow Fish's <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> also known as Prithvi, Jal, Vayu, and Agni.|$|R

500|$|The dorsal <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} small, acute, keeled, imbricate, and flattened, {{while the}} throat and pectoral (chest) <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> keeled. Granular (bumpy) <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> found {{on the top of}} the head and the [...] neck, while the scales on the middle of the neck are keeled, acute, flattened, and imbricate. In the middle of the back, there is some crowding and size reduction in the scales, and none of these <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> granular. On the dorsal side of the tail, the <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> acute, keeled, imbricate, and flattened. On the underside of the tail, the <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> smooth, rounded, and enlarged towards the centre of the tail (mid-ventrally). The ventral <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> rounded, smooth, cycloid (have a smooth outer edge), and imbricate. The scales on the ventral caudal (head) <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> smooth, cycloid, and enlarged mid-ventrally.|$|R
5|$|Stabilizing {{the person}} is the first priority. Those with a {{depressed}} level of consciousness {{may need to be}} intubated and mechanically ventilated. Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and Glasgow Coma <b>Scale</b> <b>are</b> monitored frequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, admission to an intensive care unit may be preferable, especially since 15 percent may have further bleeding soon after admission. Nutrition is an early priority, with by mouth or nasogastric tube feeding being preferable over parenteral routes. In general, pain control is restricted to less-sedating agents such as codeine, as sedation may impact on the mental status and thus interfere with the ability to monitor the level of consciousness. Deep vein thrombosis is prevented with compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression of the calves, or both. A bladder catheter is usually inserted to monitor fluid balance. Benzodiazepines may be administered to help relieve distress. Antiemetic drugs should be given to awake persons.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{developing}} a <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> proposed to measure career decision making self-efficacy for primary school 8 th year students. <b>Scale</b> <b>was</b> developed according to social cognitive career and self-efficacy theory. <b>Scale</b> <b>is</b> composed of 27 items. It is a Likert type scale and has three sub <b>scales.</b> The <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> applied on 480 primary school 8 th year students for {{validity and reliability}} analysis. Construct validity of the <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> determined by factor analysis. Item-total correlation, Alfa correlation and the <b>scale</b> score stability <b>were</b> computed for reliability analysis. Findings about {{reliability and validity of}} the scale indicated that careerdecision making self efficacy <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> a valid and reliable instrument...|$|R
50|$|A letter <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> a {{weighing}} <b>scale</b> {{used for}} weighing letters {{in order to}} determine the correct amount of postage. Until the 1990s most letter <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> mechanical, but today electronic <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> the most common.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>scale</b> factor <b>is</b> {{larger than}} 1, (uniform or non-uniform) <b>scaling</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} also called dilation or enlargement.

50|$|<b>Scales</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} listed {{from low}} to high pitch. Most <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> octave-repeating, meaning their pattern of notes {{is the same}} in every octave (the Bohlen-Pierce <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> one exception). An octave-repeating <b>scale</b> can <b>be</b> represented as a circular arrangement of pitch classes, ordered by increasing (or decreasing) pitch class. For instance, the increasing C major <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C, with the bracket indicating that the last note is an octave higher than the first note, and the decreasing C major <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> C-B-A-G-F-E-D-C, with the bracket indicating an octave lower than the first note in the scale.|$|R
50|$|A {{programmable}} <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> a {{new generation}} of scale indicator. Programmable <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> offered by all the major scale manufacturers.

2500|$|An {{advantage}} of N <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> {{that it allows}} hobbyists to build layouts that take up less space than HO scale, or put longer track runs into {{the same amount of}} space, because the models are smaller (by nearly a half) than they <b>are</b> in HO <b>scale</b> (1:87). While N <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> quite small, it is not the smallest commercially available scale, as [...] Z <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> smaller yet at 1:220 and T <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> 1:450 or 1:480.

25|$|While diseconomies of <b>scale</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} {{associated with}} large mature firms, similar problems have been observed in the growth phase of small and medium-sized manufacturing companies. Mclean has observed that this can occur once the workforce exceeds around 20 employees. At this point business complexity grows more rapidly than revenue. The business experiences falling productivity, leading to rising variable costs along with rapidly rising overheads.|$|E
25|$|In microeconomics, diseconomies of <b>scale</b> <b>are</b> {{the cost}} {{disadvantages}} that firms and governments accrue due {{to increase in}} firm size or output, resulting in production {{of goods and services}} at increased per-unit costs. This typically follows the law of diminishing returns, where further increase in size of output will result in even greater increase in average cost. This concept is the opposite of economies of scale.|$|E

25|$|Sensitivity to {{the data}} {{distribution}} {{can be used to}} an advantage. For example, scaled correlation is designed to use the sensitivity to the range in order to pick out correlations between fast components of time series.
