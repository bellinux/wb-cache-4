40|$|Using {{photographic}} flash for candid shots {{often results}} in an unevenly lit scene, in which objects in the back appear dark. We describe a spatially adaptive photographic flash system, in which the intensity of illumination varies depending on the depth and reflectivity of features in the scene. We adapt to changes in depth using a <b>single-shot</b> <b>method,</b> and to changes in reflectivity using a multi-shot method. The <b>single-shot</b> <b>method</b> requires only a depth image, whereas the multi-shot method requires at least one color image {{in addition to the}} depth data. To reduce noise in our depth images, we present a novel filter that takes into account the amplitude-dependent noise distribution of observed depth values. To demonstrate our ideas, we have built a prototype consisting of a depth camera, a flash light, an LCD and a lens. By attenuating the flash using the LCD, a variety of illumination effects can be achieved. Categories and Subject Descriptors (according to ACM CCS) ...|$|E

While CMOVE deals with the multiple objectives on a single agent level, VELS deals with the multiple objectives on a joint decision level, leading to different trade-offs. We also proposed a naive way (approximate optimistic linear support (AOLS)) to apply the scheme of VELS to sequential settings, which does not yet fully exploit loose couplings.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Single-shot</b> {{structured}} light <b>methods</b> allow 3 D reconstruction of dynamic scenes. However, such methods lose spatial resolution and perform poorly around depth discontinuities. Previous <b>single-shot</b> <b>methods</b> project {{the same pattern}} repeatedly; thereby spatial resolution is reduced even if the scene is static or has slowly moving parts. We present a {{structured light}} system using a sequence of shifted stripe patterns that is decodable both spatially and temporally. By default, our <b>method</b> allows <b>single-shot</b> 3 D reconstruction with any of our projected patterns by using spatial windows. Moreover, the sequence is designed so as to progressively improve the reconstruction quality around depth discontinuities by using temporal windows. Our method enables motion-aware reconstruction for each pixel: The best spatio-temporal window is automatically selected depending on the scene structure, motion, {{and the number of}} available images. This significantly reduces the number of pixels around discontinuities where depth cannot be recovered in traditional approaches. Our decoding scheme extends the adaptive window matching commonly used in stereo by incorporating temporal windows with 1 D spatial windows. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach for a variety of scenarios including thin structures, dynamic scenes, and scenes containing both static and dynamic regions.

40|$|Imaging through {{scattering}} {{materials is}} an important research area that is generally limited to medical diagnostic applications.

It is a <b>single-shot</b> <b>method</b> which employs {{only a single}} image, so it is fast and robust against vibration. LMF {{does not require a}} conventional assumption of smoothness of the target surface in the band-limit sense, but we instead assume that the target surface is locally constant. This enables us to recover sharp edges on the surface. LMF employs only local image data, so objects covered with heterogeneous materials can also be measured. The LMF algorithm is simple to implement and is efficient in computation. Experimental results showed that the proposed LMF method works excellently.

40|$|Active {{illumination}} based {{methods have}} a trade-off be-tween acquisition time and {{resolution of the}} estimated 3 D shapes. Multi-shot approaches can generate dense recon-structions but require stationary scenes. In contrast, <b>single-shot</b> <b>methods</b> are applicable to dynamic objects but can only estimate sparse reconstructions and are sensitive to surface texture. In this work, we develop a single-shot approach to produce dense reconstructions of highly textured objects. The key to our approach is an image decomposition scheme that can recover the illumination and the texture images from their mixed appearance. Despite the complex appear-ances of the illuminated textured regions, our method can accurately compute per pixel warps from the illumination pattern and the texture template to the observed image. The texture template is obtained by interleaving the projection sequence with an all-white pattern. Our estimated warping functions are reliable even with infrequent interleaved pro-jection. Thus, we obtain detailed shape reconstruction and dense motion tracking of the textured surfaces. We validate the approach on synthetic and real data containing subtle non-rigid surface deformations. 1...|$|R

Synchrotron facilities, which deliver a beam of high brilliance and high coherence, provide the ideal condition to develop such advanced phase-sensitive methods, but their access is limited.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{estimating}} the difference between two probability den-sities. A naive approach is a two-step procedure that rst estimates two densities separately and then computes their difference. However, such a two-step procedure does not necessarily work well because the rst step is performed without regard to the second step and thus a small error in the rst stage can cause a big error in the second stage. Recently, a <b>single-shot</b> <b>method</b> called the least-squares density-difference (LSDD) estimator has been proposed. LSDD directly estimates the den-sity difference without separately estimating two densities, and it was demonstrated to outperform the two-step approach. In this paper, we propose a variation of LSDD called the constrained least-squares density-difference (CLSDD) estimator, and the-oretically prove that CLSDD improves the accuracy of density difference estimation for correctly specied parametric models.

40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [61205103]The {{dispersive}} Fourier transform {{is suitable}} for characterizing short pulses. However, the traditional temporal Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm suffers from the timing error of measured dispersed waveforms, which limits the measurement performance of the temporal phase.

40|$|Single-shot {{femtosecond}} spectroscopic {{methods have}} been developed to study the dynamics of solids or other nonflowable condensed phase samples where the accumulation of reaction products prevents the use of conventional femtosecond spectroscopic methods.

40|$|Purpose: Cross-term spatiotemporal encoding-xSPEN-is a single-shot imaging {{approach}} with exceptional resilience to field heterogeneities: its images {{do not require}} a priori information nor use post-acquisition corrections, to deliver faithfully the spatial distribution. xSPEN, however, suffers from SNR penalties due to its non-Fourier nature and due to diffusion losses- specially when desiring high resolution. This study explores partial Fourier transform approaches that acting along either the readout or the spatiotemporally-encoded dimensions, reduce these penalties. Methods: xSPEN uses an orthogonal gradient to read, in direct space, the lowbandwidth dimension. This changes substantially the nature of partial Fourier acquisitions vis-a-vis conventional imaging counterparts. A suitable theoretical analysis, however, allows one to implement these procedures along either the low-bandwidth or readout axes. Results: Partial Fourier <b>single-shot</b> xSPEN <b>methods</b> are illustrated on preclinical and human scanners. Owing to their reduction in the experimental acquisition times, these methods provide substantial sensitivity gains vis-a-vis previous implementations for a given targeted in-plane resolution.
