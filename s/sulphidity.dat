40|$|The wood of {{the gender}} Eucalyptus {{occupies}} a prominence place among other cellulose sources due to its chemical composition, its low cost, abundance and availability. Among the chemical pulping processes, kraft process is the most extensively one used {{for the production of}} cellulosic pulps starting from eucalyptus wood. The anthraquinone (AQ) usage in the pulping has as main purposes to increase the delignification rate as well as to protect the pulp from the carbohydrate degradation. The present work has aimed to use the anthraquinone as an addictive in the cooking seeking to reduce the load of applied <b>sulphidity</b> without harming the quality of the pulp. The kraft and kraft/AQ cooking were accomplished in rotative laboratorial digester being varied the active alkali initially (10, 13, 16 and 19 %) and, later, the <b>sulphidity</b> (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 %), maintaining the other conditions constant aiming to obtain pulp with kappa number close to nine. Starting from the variation of the active alkali and of the <b>sulphidity,</b> delignification curves were established between active alkali and kappa number and, <b>sulphidity</b> and kappa number, where it was possible to establish the minimum necessary amounts of alkali, {{as well as of the}} <b>sulphidity.</b> Starting from the cooking, it was possible to establish the active alkali and <b>sulphidity</b> loads of 17, 4 % and 8, 8 %, respectively. The cooking to the certain conditions presented screened yield of 48, 63 %, and the yield based on the initial mass of wood was of 42, 24 %, obtaining a high quality pulp, in other words, with low number kappa and hemicelluloses tenor (0, 41 %) and high tenor of alpha cellulose (98, 49 %) ...|$|E

Kraft pulp samples {{were obtained by}} digesting 500  g wood chip of C. japonica using high-pressure micro reactor (MMS- 1000, OM lab-tech Co., Ltd., Japan). Kraft pulping was carried out under the following conditions: heating the sample from room temperature to maximum temperature in 90  min, maintaining at the maximum temperature of 170 [*]°C for 1  h, using active alkali as NaOH of 24 %, <b>sulphidity</b> of 41 %, and water ratio of 5 to the wood chip.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{centered}} on finding a locally sourced alternative to imported long-fibre pulp for Nigerian {{pulp and paper}} mills. Fibre characteristics, chemical composition, and paper properties of pulp handsheets {{at different levels of}} kappa number and freeness in the range of 10 oSR and 62 oSR were evaluated using air-dried bast fibre obtained from decorticated kenaf plants grown in southern guinea savanna near Jebba, Nigeria. Kenaf bast fibre compared well with softwood, with an average fibre length of 2. 90 mm, a flexibility ratio of 57 %, and a Runkel ratio of 0. 76. Ash, lignin, and pentosan contents were 0. 6 %, 12. 5 %, and 10. 6 %, respectively, while the cellulose content was 55. 5 %. Under alkali charge of 15. 0 and, <b>sulphidity</b> of 17. 5 with constant temperature, cooking time, and liquor-to-fibre ratio of 4. 5 : 1, the screen yield was between 48. 8 to 52. 8 % with kappa number 12. 04 to 20. 5. Unbleached pulpsheets at kappa number between 15 and 18. 5 and pulp freeness 55 oSR and bleached pulp freeness between 148 and 336 mLs had better quality paper in terms of overall pulpsheet strength properties...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this work}} {{was to assess the}} impact of {{hemicellulose}} extraction in eucalyptus wood, through alkaline leaching (NaOH) of wood chips, on the subsequent kraft process (with varying <b>sulphidity)</b> and the quality of the pulp. The chips were initially saturated with water and treated with a NaOH solution in a liquor to wood ratio of 6 : 1 m 3 /t. The reaction times (3, 8, 14 and 16 hours), temperatures (70, 84 and 90 °C) and NaOH concentrations (60, 80, 90, 120 and 156 g/L) were assessed in atmospheric conditions. In the pressurized treatments (300 kPa), the reaction times, temperature and NaOH concentrations assessed were, respectively: 30, 60 and 120 minutes, 100 °C and 100, 150 and 200 g/L. The optimal alkaline leaching condition was determined taking into account the hemicellulose concentrations remaining in the chips and the gravimetrical yield. Chips not subjected to alkaline treatment (control) and leached with NaOH in optimum conditions were kraft cooked until kappa number 17 – 18. The results indicate that alkaline leaching of chips is not efficient in extracting hemicelluloses in the wood studied. The highest extraction of 4 -O-methyl-glucuronoxylan acetate reached 42 % in very severe conditions (100 °C, 60 minutes, 200 g/L of NaOH and 300 kPa pressure). The pulp yield of the leached chips was approximately 7 % lower than that of the non-leached chips (control) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{was aimed at}} assessing the influence of tree level of maturity {{and the amount of}} additive used in the sulphate cooking process on the properties of the corresponding resulting pulp. The trees selected in this regard were Gmelina arborea Roxb., consisting of four levels of maturities, i. e. 6, 8, 10 and 12 years. The additives used in the process were polysulfide (PS) and anthraqinone. The anthraquinone (AQ) was added 0. 1 percent, without PS, and in the other cooking PS at 4. 0 percent, without AQ. Meanwhile, this modified sulphate process was also conducted with any additive 4. 0 percent PS and 0. 1 percent AQ. As a control. the sulphate cooking without both was carried out as well. Other cooking conditions were kept constant, i. e. active alkali 16 percent, <b>sulphidity</b> 25 percent, wood to liquor ratio 1 : 4, maximum temperature 170 °C. and total cooking durations 4 hours. The results revealed that the increase in tree maturity up to 10 years produced pulp with the highest yield. However. the pulp yield decreased when the maturity reached 12 years, which was the case when the pulp was obtained from the 6 -years wood material. The use of 0. 1 percent AQ additive did not improve the pulp yield but decreased the kappa number. The highest yield was obtained at 4. 0 percent PS additive, followed by the one using the combination of 4. 0 percent PS and 0. 1 percent AQ. Melina wood from the corresponding 6 year old trees appeared technically suitable as raw material for pulp, since it strength was fairly high to meet the Indonesian National Standard (SNI) for the one from long-fibered softwood. Besides that. the use of additive improved the strength of pulp...|$|E
