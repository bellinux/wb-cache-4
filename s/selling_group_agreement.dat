In the <b>group</b> key <b>agreement,</b> it is {{important}} to maintain integrity of generated session-keys even if some of group members behave maliciously. Our basic strategy is ensuring integrity of nonces delivered among parties in a <b>group</b> key <b>agreement</b> protocol, using a kind of message authentication code of the nonces. To avoid a possible leak of information of generated session-keys through such MACs, we employ two initiators in our protocol. Since an adversary cannot know how to divide nonces among the two initiators, we can guarantee that MACs do not leak any information of session-keys. Thus we establish integrity without loosing secrecy of session-keys, that leads to UC-security of our <b>group</b> key <b>agreement</b> protocol...|$|R

Current constant-round GKA protocols are either efficient and nonrobust or robust but not efficient; assuming a reliable broadcast communication medium, the standard encryption-based <b>group</b> key <b>agreement</b> protocol can be robust against arbitrary number of node faults, but {{the size of the}} messages broadcast by every player is proportional to the number of players. In contrast, nonrobust <b>group</b> key <b>agreement</b> can be achieved with each player broadcasting just constant-sized messages. We propose a novel 2 -round <b>group</b> key <b>agreement</b> protocol, which tolerates up to T node failures, using O(T) sized messages for any T.

The protocol can be extended to withstand malicious insiders at small constant factor increases in bandwidth and computation.
