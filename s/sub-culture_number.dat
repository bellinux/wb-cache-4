30|$|Shoot {{initiation}} {{response in}} shoot base explants derived from in vitro raised seedlings of S. involucrata was very poor. Out {{of the five}} basal media tested, the maximum response in 49  % explants with an average 0.85 shoot/explant was observed on 1 / 2 X MSBM after 50  days of incubation. Non-responding shoots turned brown. In the first <b>sub-culture,</b> <b>number</b> of shoots per explant increased to 3.89 in 93.3  % explants however shoots became vitrified (Fig.  1 b). In the second subculture, a marked difference was observed between vitrified and normal (non-vitrified) explants and media composition {{with respect to the}} number of proliferating shoots. The maximum shoots (13 shoots/per explant) were observed on 3 / 4 X MSBM supplemented with BA (1.0  mg/L− 1) and NAA (1.5  mg/L− 1) in case of normal (non-vitrified) explants, while vitrified explants resulted in 4.2 shoots/explant (Fig.  1 c). The next best shoot proliferation (11.1 shoots/explant) was achieved on 1 / 4 X MSBM supplemented with 2.0  mg/L− 1 BA and 0.5  mg/L− 1 NAA in case of non-vitrified explants. Since, media combinations in the 3 -factorial experiment are too many to tabulate, hence, here we have described only the best responses observed with regard to the number of shoots.|$|E
