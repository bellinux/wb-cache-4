30|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{there is a}} growing demand for the high speed data rate services, but which cannot be {{supported}} by existing congested frequency spectrum. To overcome the spectral congestion and support future traffic demands, use of  MM-Wave frequency band has been proposed. The MM-Wave band ranging from 30 to 300  GHz provides huge bandwidth (BW) of about 270  GHz, due to this abundant BW it can be used in future wireless communication and space communication to provide long-distance ultra-capacity services [1 – 3]. However, one of the major issues of the MM-Wave communication is the generation and transmission since electrical generation of such high frequency signal is very troublesome process. Hence optical MM-Wave generation and RoF transmission methods have been proposed. Though there are several methods of optical MM-Wave generation techniques, external modulation based optical frequency multiplication techniques have gained much attention due to its higher modulation bandwidth, stability and flexibility [4 – 7]. Several optical frequency upconversion/multiplication techniques have been demonstrated with different frequency multiplication such as four, six, eight, ten and twelve [8 – 16]. Aforementioned techniques have utilized external modulation with optical carrier suppression (OCS) for the better unwanted sideband suppression using Lithium Niobate –Mach-Zehnder Modulators (LN-MZM). Similarly, such a OCS phenomenon can also be achieved using phase modulators (PM) with higher modulation index [17]. The OCS based frequency multiplication will greatly improve RoF transport systems due to its dispersion tolerance. However, MM-Wave generation with higher frequency multiplication factors play major role in limiting the need for high frequency electronic RF LOs at the Central Station. But, single MZM cannot provide sufficient flexibility to select and generate the desired higher order optical sidebands and hence several <b>series</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>configuration</b> have been utilized to achieve high frequency multiplication factors. Hasan et al. have utilized array of four phase modulators to generate frequency octupling and 24 tupling [18]. Recently, several frequency 16 - tupling techniques have been demonstrated using two cascaded MZMs with two tunable lasers [19], dual parallel MZMs [20], two cascaded dual parallel MZMs [21], and dual stage cascaded MZMs [22]. The modulation indices of these schemes are very high and used complex circuit arrangements. The higher modulation indices will have low conversion efficiency. Moreover, RFSSR and OSSRs of the proposals [19 – 21] are low. Hence in this paper, a cascaded combination of four MZMs is utilized to reduce the modulation index and improve the optical and RF sideband suppression ratios.|$|E

30|$|In an {{arrangement}} series, {{the whole system}} is no longer operational if a single component fails. This means that all components must be operational for the serial system to succeed. If a system with n independent components is considered, the reliability (instantaneous availability or steady-state availability) is obtained by the product of component’s reliabilities (instantaneous availability or steady-state availability). In a parallel arrangement, the whole system is considered operational even if only a single component is operational, {{because there are a}} total of n possible success paths. For a system with n independent components, the unreliability (instantaneous unavailability or steady-state unavailability) is obtained by the product of component’s unreliability (instantaneous unavailability or steady-state unavailability). k-out-n redundancy may also be represented by RBDs. k-out-n RBD models allows you to represent more general compositions than simple <b>series</b> or <b>parallel</b> <b>configurations.</b> Actually, simple <b>series</b> or <b>parallel</b> <b>configurations</b> are special cases of k-out-n compositions [24, 25, 31, 42].|$|R

With respect to the series configuration the net electrical power output and the exergetic plant efficiency are 2. 1 – 9. 9 % and 0. 7 – 3. 0 %-pts higher, respectively, where the highest values correspond to the lowest heat demand. Furthermore, the optimal CHP <b>configuration</b> - <b>series,</b> <b>parallel</b> or ‘‘Preheat-parallel”- is discussed. The optimal configuration depends on the DH system requirements.

Finally, a practical application is tested to demonstrate the effectiveness of such small rectenna array. 1. Introduction With the development of very low-power wireless system, numerous researches have focused their attention on the feasibility of powering devices through the harvesting of ambient electromagnetic energy [1]. The main challenges in far field nondirective powering are a result of the low and variable power densities available at the receiving antenna. Therefore, the study deals with the design, optimization and experimental characterization of a compact metamaterial-inspired antenna coupled with a rectifier. Then, to increase DC power over the load, the proposed rectenna has been interconnected to form arrays [2]. This is called DC-combining configuration where the outputs of each rectenna are combined in <b>series,</b> <b>parallel</b> or a hybrid manner. It has the advantages to ease the construction of the rectenna array oppositely to the RF-combining configuration. In RF-combining structure, the RF outputs of each antenna are combined before the rectifier circuit. The RF-combining configuration implies the use of sub-circuit to deal with power leakage and phasing between the antennas. This issue is eliminated when DC-combining is use, but the tradeoff of such configuration, is lower RF-to-DC conversion and the use of several rectifying element. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of rectenna array using electrically small antenna.

By using the testing system to investigate four sizing models the operation and suitability of the models was determined. One of the sizing models, PVYST was discovered to simulate flow rates that exceed the maximum flow rate of the pump, which could result in an overestimation {{of the volume of}} water supplied. Additionally, the behaviour of the pump to <b>series</b> and <b>parallel</b> <b>configurations</b> of the photovoltaic array was investigated to determine if the manufacturer&# 146;s sizing was accurate. Also, a sizing model for directly couple centrifugal pumps was adapted for high head pumps with maximum power point trackers and was determined to be suitable and had better agreement with the experimental results than the other models...|$|R
