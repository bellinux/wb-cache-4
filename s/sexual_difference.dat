5|$|There are two {{possible}} explanations {{for the evolution of}} this <b>sexual</b> <b>difference</b> in bill shape. The most widely supported is that it allowed birds of different sexes to utilise different food sources. This divergence may have arisen {{because of a lack of}} competitors in these foraging niches in the North Island forest ecosystems. The other idea is that the ivory-coloured bill, which contrasted sharply with the bird's black plumage, may have been used to attract a mate. In animals that use sexually dimorphic physical traits to attract a mate, the dimorphic feature is often brightly coloured or contrasts with the rest of the body, as with the huia. It has been suggested that as the female was the main provider of food for the chicks by regurgitation, this sex evolved the longer bill to obtain the protein-rich invertebrate diet required for the chicks.|$|E

500|$|In the 1970s {{there was}} a view that the free {{improvisation}} music space was largely the domain of male heterosexuals, and that women were marginalized. Canadian academic Julie Dawn Smith wrote in her 2004 essay, [...] "Playing Like a Girl: The Queer Laughter of the Feminist Improvising Group", that [...] "The opportunity for freedom in relation to <b>sexual</b> <b>difference,</b> gender, and sexuality for women improvisers was strangely absent from the discourses and practices of free jazz and free improvisation". When the Feminist Improvising Group appeared in 1977, they challenged the established male-dominated musical improvising community. FIG were a mixture of white, black, lesbian, straight, working- and middle-class women. Maggie Nicols wanted the group {{to be open to}} all women of different backgrounds and different levels of musicianship, even those who had not improvised before. She saw these differing abilities, which gave rise to unexpected results, as a strength and not a weakness. According to critic Dana Reason Myers, [...] "The result was a music that had to be taken on its own terms, as music that decidedly and consciously included the politics of being women, musicians, improvisers, and members of a society." ...|$|E

[...] The editing style of the Nazi march scene juxtaposes Dussander marching in the uniform and Bowden reacting to the march. Shots of Bowden's reaction are from a low angle, which reflects [...] "the <b>sexual</b> <b>difference</b> between the characters"; Bowden is masculinized as [...] "the bearer of the [...] gaze", and Dussander is feminized as [...] "the object of the gaze". The cutting between Bowden and Dussander [...] "corroborates a homoerotic arrangement of images" [...] which visualizes the latent homoeroticism of the scene from the novella. When Dussander speeds up his march and Bowden tells him to stop, the sped-up shot reverse shot [...] "radically [...] the structure of power", where Bowden loses [...] "control of his sadistic power over Dussander".|$|E

2500|$|Toril Moi has {{developed}} a feminist perspective on psychoanalysis proposing {{that it is a}} discourse that [...] "attempts to understand the psychic consequences of three universal traumas: {{the fact that there are}} others, the fact of <b>sexual</b> <b>difference,</b> and the fact of death".

2500|$|Psychoanalytic {{feminism}} and feminist psychoanalysis {{are based on}} Freud and his psychoanalytic theories, but they also supply an important critique of it. It maintains that gender is not biological but {{is based on the}} psycho-sexual development of the individual, but also that <b>sexual</b> <b>difference</b> and gender are different notions. Psychoanalytical feminists believe that gender inequality comes from early childhood experiences, which lead men to believe themselves to be masculine, and women to believe themselves feminine. It is further maintained that gender leads to a social system that is dominated by males, which in turn influences the individual psycho-sexual development. As a solution it was suggested by some to avoid the gender-specific structuring of the society coeducation. From the last 30 years of the 20th Century, the contemporary French psychoanalytical theories concerning the feminine, that refer to <b>sexual</b> <b>difference</b> rather than to gender, with psychoanalysts like Julia Kristeva,Maud Mannoni, Luce Irigaray, and Bracha Ettinger, have largely influenced not only feminist theory but also the understanding of the subject in philosophy and the general field of psychoanalysis itself. These French psychoanalysts are mainly post-Lacanian. Other feminist psychoanalysts and feminist theorists whose contributions have enriched the field through an engagement with psychoanalysis are Jessica Benjamin, Jacqueline Rose, [...] Ranjana Khanna, and Shoshana Felman.|$|E
2500|$|Psychologist Carol Gilligan {{writes that}} [...] "The penchant of {{developmental}} theorists {{to project a}} masculine image, and one that appears frightening to women, goes {{back at least to}} Freud."

Gilligan notes that Nancy Chodorow, in contrast to Freud, attributes <b>sexual</b> <b>difference</b> not to anatomy but to the fact that male and female children have different early social environments. Chodorow, writing against the masculine bias of psychoanalysis, [...] "replaces Freud's negative and derivative description of female psychology with a positive and direct account of her own." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea of a}} corpo-Real {{is a part of}} her symbolization of a new {{feminine}} psychic zone (the matrixial, {{the womb}} as time space of psychic encounter-event), in both male and female subjects, and of the feminine-matrixial <b>sexual</b> <b>difference.</b> Thus, even if Ettinger critiques the Freudian and Lacanian analysis of the feminine, she considers herself as a [...] "post" [...] or [...] "neo" [...] Freudian and Lacanian, who elaborates the feminine in continuity to these psychoanalysts, but claims a supplementary feminine-maternal Eros. Ettinger criticises Winnicott and Bollas for offering patients a [...] "ready-made mother-monster" [...] as a cause for each psychic pain. She considers any practice of archaic-motherhood blaming as an obstacle, as [...] "hystericizing" [...] and even momentarily [...] "psychoticizing" [...] (in the sense of leading to internal splits rather than recognition of differences,) when such [...] "cause" [...] is brought as [...] "explanation" [...] by the analyst, a [...] "cause" [...] attributed to the unremembered early period of life where I and non-I are transconnected. Ettinger agrees with Lacan that the [...] "ultimate" [...] cause is in principle lacking: objet a. She calls for a delicate process of differentiation, coemergence, and cofading between the generations, especially in analysing the same-sex (daughter-mother, son-father) relationships, with emphasize on transmission, not split. Thus, the process itself helps to negotiate and articulate delicately <b>sexual</b> <b>difference,</b> in the present. To the idea that the self is structured via mirror-like reflection she adds that of primal apperception of the other, through [...] "fascinance" [...] (aesthetic openness to the other and the cosmos), compassion and awe (affective accesses to the other) directed from the beginning to the (m)Other and the outside, not to the self.|$|E

2500|$|Influenced by Klein, and {{initiating}} {{what became}} known as the Jonesâ€“Freud controversy, Jones set out to explore a range of interlinked topics in the theory of early psychic development. These included the structure and genesis of the superego and the nature of the feminine castration complex. He coined the term phallocentrism in a critique of Freudâ€™s account of <b>sexual</b> <b>difference.</b> He argued together with Klein and her Berlin colleague, Karen Horney, for a primary femininity, saying that penis envy arose as a defensive formation rather than arising from the fact, or [...] "injury", of biological asymmetry. In a corresponding reformulation of the castration complex, Jones introduced the concept of [...] "aphanisis" [...] to refer to the fear of [...] "the permanent extinction of the capacity (including opportunity) for sexual enjoyment".|$|E
2500|$|The {{sociologist}} Jonathan Dollimore {{wrote that}} Scruton sees homosexuality as a perversion and that Scruton's philosophy of sex {{is open to}} many possible objections.

[...] He found Scruton's writing to be jargon-ridden, believing that its Hegelian framework bestows [...] "a spurious profundity on a normative sexual politics which is at heart timid, conservative, and deeply ignorant." [...] Dollimore also argued that, notwithstanding Scruton's attack on psychoanalysis, his defense of <b>sexual</b> <b>difference</b> is to some degree indebted to psychoanalytic theory. The jurist Richard Posner argued that Scruton does not provide any adequate reason for viewing homosexuality as immoral.|$|E
2500|$|Biddick {{complained that}} [...] "The model of gender in Holy Feast and Holy Fast assumes that gender is an essence that appears prior to other {{categories}} and informs them, that the feminine mirrors, indeed reduces to, the female reproductive function, {{that the female}} body is the originary, foundational site of gender." [...] Furthermore (as mentioned above in the [...] "essentialism" [...] section) Biddick observes [...] "Bynum calls this <b>sexual</b> <b>difference</b> 'gender,' but for her gender carries the more restricted sense of [...] "woman," [...] and she argues that a true [...] "historical study of medieval gender interrupts this foundational category of Christianitas by asking how a historical construction of gender in medieval Christendom was simultaneously a construction of other differences."

2500|$|Like {{the term}} [...] "butch," [...] femme {{can be used}} as an {{adjective}} or a noun. Femmes are not [...] "read" [...] as lesbians or queer unless they are with a butch partner, because they conform to traditional standards of femininity. Because they do not express masculine qualities, femmes were particularly vexing to sexologists and psychoanalysts who wanted to argue that all lesbians wished to be men. [...] Traditionally, the femme in a butch-femme couple was expected to act as a stereotypical feminine woman and provide emotional support for her butch partner. [...] In {{the first half of the}} twentieth century, when butch-femme gender roles were constrained to the underground bar scene, femmes were considered invisible without a butch partner - that is, they could pass as straight because of their gender conformity. [...] However, Joan Nestle asserts that femmes in a butch-femme couple make both the butch and the femme exceedingly visible. [...] By daring to be publicly attracted to butch women, femmes reflected their own <b>sexual</b> <b>difference</b> and made the butch a known subject of desire.|$|E
2500|$|According to Nancy Cooey, Kahlo {{made herself}} through her {{paintings}} into [...] "the main character {{of her own}} mythology, as a woman, as a Mexican, and as a suffering person ... She knew how to convert each into a symbol or sign capable of expressing the enormous spiritual resistance of humanity and its splendid sexuality". Similarly, Nancy Deffebach has stated that Kahlo [...] "created herself as a subject who was female, Mexican, modern, and powerful", and who diverged from the usual dichotomy of roles of mother/whore allowed to women in Mexican society. Due to her gender and divergence from the muralist tradition, Kahlo's paintings were treated as less political and more naÃ¯ve and subjective than those of her male counterparts up until the late 1980s. According to art historian Joan Borsa, [...] "the critical reception of her exploration of subjectivity and personal history has all too frequently denied or de-emphasized the politics involved in examining one's own location, inheritances and social conditions [...] Critical responses continue to gloss over Kahlo's reworking of the personal, ignoring or minimizing her interrogation of sexuality, <b>sexual</b> <b>difference,</b> marginality, cultural identity, female subjectivity, politics and power." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ettinger {{articulated}} a feminine-maternal (and feminine-prematernal) dimension, space, function, Eros {{and dynamics}} {{in the human}} Unconscious. She had suggested that pre-natal impressions, connected to the phantasmatic and traumatic real of the pregnant becoming-mother, are trans-inscribed in the emerging subject and form the primary phase and position of the human psyche. [...] "I" [...] and [...] "non-I", without rejection and without symbiotic fusion, conjointly inscribe memory traces that are dispersed asymmetrically but in a trans-subjective mode. Trans-subjective mental and affective unconscious [...] "strings", connecting the prenatal emerging subject to the archaic m/Other, open unconscious routes ("feminine", non phallic, in both males and females) that enable subjectivizing processes all throughout life whenever a new matrixial encounter-event takes place. The matrixial encounter-event forms specific aesthetical and ethical accesses to the Other. Ettinger articulated the 'matrixial gaze' {{and the process of}} 'co-poiesis'. This allows new understanding of trans-generational transmission, trauma and artistic processes. Ettinger formulates the woman(girl)-to-woman(mother) difference as the first <b>sexual</b> <b>difference</b> for females to be viewed first of all according to the matrixial parameters. The feminie-maternal Eros informs also the father/son and mother/son relations. According to Ettinger, in parallel but also before expressions of abjection (Julia Kristeva) or rejection (Freud on Narcissism) of the other, primary compassion, awe and fascinance (which are unconscious psychic affective accesses to the other, and which join reattunement and differentiating-in-jointness by borderlinking) occur. The combination of fascinance and primary compassion does not enter the economy of social exchange, attraction and rejection; it has particular forms of Eros and of resistance that can inspire the political sphere and reach action and speech that is ethical-political without entering any political institutional organization. The infant's primary compassion is a proto-ethical psychological means that joins the aesthetical fascinance and creates a feel-knowing that functions at best within maternal (and also parental) compassionate hospitality. Here, one witnesses in jointness: The I wit(h)ness while borderlinking (bordurelaint) to the non-I and borderspacing (bordurespacant) from the other. Ettinger calls for the recognition of the matrixial transference as a dimension in the transferential relationships in psychoanalysis. They must entails besideness to (and not a split from) the archaic the m/Other (Autremere) and parental figures; jointness-in-differentiation rather than their exclusion. She sees in the trans-subjectivity a distinct dimension of human specific linkage and shareability, different from, and supplementary to [...] "inter-subjectivity" [...] and [...] "self" [...] psychology. Her most prominent and comprehensive book regarding this theory is [...] "The Matrixial Borderspace" [...] (reprint of essays from 1994â€“1999) published in French in 1999 and in English in 2006, but her most recent concepts are mainly elaborated in the different essays printed in 2005â€“2006.|$|E
