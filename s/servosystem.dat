40|$|This summary {{presents}} the main conclusions and {{results of the}} design studies conducted {{by a group of}} 13 students at the University of Maryland. The students, all participants in the spring 1989 course ENEE 418 in the Electrical Engineering Department, met weekly in a two-hour class to discuss and evaluate design alternatives. The main problem considered was the design and control of a planar testbed simulating a free-flying space robot for applications in satellite servicing. This project grew out of the 1988 class where a dual-armed free flyer (DAFF) was designed and partially built. This year, a group of six students continued the development of the DAFF, achieving computer-controlled motion of the DAFF's arms. All fabrication and testing of the DAFF is being conducted in the Intelligent <b>Servosystems</b> Laboratory at the University of Maryland. While the work related to the design and development of the DAFF is the main subject of the report, {{it should be noted that}} other students in the ENEE 418 class have investigated additional issues related to manipulation in space. For example, one group studied a new parallel linkage based manipulator for fine motion applications such as in assembly operations in space. They investigated the mechanism's kinematics, its reachable workspace, and precision of applying forces and torques. In yet another project, a student set out to measure and map the friction characteristics of the actuators used in the Modular Dextrous Hand, which has been recently developed in the Intelligent <b>Servosystems</b> Laboratory. The results are expected to help compensate for this friction, which is a highly nonlinear disturbance and presents significant problems in high-precision, low-speed operations.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a novel approach, based on system inversion, for the {{point-to-point}} motion planning of vibra-tory <b>servosystems.</b> The idea is to define a suitable parameterized motion law of the load which assures that no oscillations occurs during {{and at the end}} of the motion; then, by means of a non-causal system inversion, the command function of the system is determined with a continuous derivative of an arbitrary order. A procedure that minimizes the duration of the movement, taking into account actuator constraints, can then be performed. Compar-isons with the well-known input shaping techniques have been per-formed via both a simulation example and an experimental setup. The proposed method, which is inherently robust to modeling er-rors, emerges as a very flexible and competitive technique.

40|$|The {{following}} work {{is concerned}} {{with the use of the}} Method of Least Squares in the parameter estimation of a discrete-time model of a system. In particular, the emphasis is upon both the initial convergence and accuracy of the estimates. The investigation is therefore pertinent to both the "cold-starting" of least squares estimators, and to systems in which "jump" changes in parameters occur, requiring resetting of the estimator. The work was approached from an engineering viewpoint, with the requirement that the theory be applied to a real system. The real system selected was a positional <b>servosystem,</b> using a DC motor. A number of least squares algorithms were compared for their suitability to such an application. The algorithms examined were: 1) A standard, non-recursive solution of the least squares equations by Lower-Upper Factorisation of the information matrix. 2) A standard, recursive solution, i. e. Recursive Least Squares, RLS. 3) Two reduced order solutions using a priori knowledge of the type number of the <b>servosystem</b> (LU Factorisation and RLS). 4) An Extended Least Squares Solution, using a recursive algorithm. 5) Several non-recursive solutions using instrumental variables. The methods were initially examined using a software simulation of the <b>servosystem.</b> This simulation was based on a linear, second-order model. It was concluded that the preferred methods were the reduced-order solutions using a priori knowledge. The following hypothesis was examined: By raising the rate at which the signals are sampled, more information is provided to the estimator in any given period of time. Increasing the sampling rate should therefore result in a superior, real-time parameter estimator...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Many biaxial {{contouring}} systems involve competing {{control objectives}} of maximizing accuracy while minimizing tra-versal time. A model predictive controller for contouring systems is proposed where the control inputs {{are determined by}} mini-mizing a cost function which reflects the tradeoff between these competing objectives, subject to state and actuator constraints. The path speed is automatically adjusted to maintain accuracy along the path, and the cost function can be tuned towards higher contouring accuracy and lower path speed, or vice versa. To fa-cilitate real-time implementation, a linear time-varying approach is proposed. The controller is successfully implemented in real time on an X-Y table, and experimental results demonstrate that the new contouring control scheme achieves an improvement in performance compared to both industry standard and advanced tracking controllers.
