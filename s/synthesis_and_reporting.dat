40|$|AbstractThe United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) has lacked an {{efficient}} mechanism to access scientific knowledge since entering into force in 1996. In 2011 {{it decided to}} convene an Ad Hoc Working Group on Scientific Advice (AGSA) {{and gave it a}} unique challenge: to design a new mechanism for science-policy communication based on the best available scientific evidence. This paper outlines the innovative ‘modular mechanism’ which the AGSA proposed to the UNCCD in September 2013, and how it was designed. Framed by the boundary organization model, and an understanding of {{the emergence of a new}} multi-scalar and polycentric style of governing, the modular mechanism consists of three modules: a Science-Policy Interface (SPI); an international self-governing and self-organizing Independent Non-Governmental Group of Scientists; and Regional Science and Technology Hubs in each UNCCD region. Now that the UNCCD has established the SPI, it is up to the worldwide scientific community to take the lead in establishing the other two modules. Science-policy communication in other UN environmental conventions could benefit from three generic principles corresponding to the innovations in the three modules—joint management of science-policy interfaces by policy makers and scientists; the production of synthetic assessments of scientific knowledge by autonomous and accountable groups of scientists; and multi-scalar and multi-directional <b>synthesis</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> of knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Although {{cervical}} cancer is largely preventable through screening, detection {{and treatment of}} precancerous abnormalities, it {{remains one of the}} top causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality globally. The objective of this systematic review is to understand the evidence of the effect of {{cervical cancer}} education compared to control conditions on cervical cancer screening rates in eligible women population at risk of cervical cancer. We also sought to understand the effect of provider recommendations for screening to eligible women on cervical cancer screening (CCS) rates compared to control conditions in eligible women population at risk of cervical cancer. We used the PICO (Problem or Population, Interventions, Comparison and Outcome) framework as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook to develop our search strategy. The details of our search strategy has been described in our systematic review protocol published in the International Prospective Register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO). The protocol registration number is CRD 42016045605 available at: [URL] The search string was used in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Systematic Reviews and Cochrane CENTRAL register of controlled trials to retrieve study reports that were screened for inclusion in this review. Our data <b>synthesis</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA). We did a qualitative synthesis of evidence and, where appropriate, individual study effects were pooled in meta-analyses using RevMan 5. 3 Review Manager. The Higgins I 2 was used to assess for heterogeneity in studies pooled together for overall summary effects. We did assessment of risk of bias of individual studies included and assessed risk of publication bias across studies pooled together in meta-analysis by Funnel plot. Out of 3072 study reports screened, 28 articles were found to be eligible for inclusion in qualitative synthesis (5 of which were included in meta-analysis of educational interventions and 8 combined in meta-analysis of HPV self-sampling interventions), while 45 were excluded for various reasons. The use of theory-based educational interventions significantly increased CCS rates by more than double (OR, 2. 46, 95 % CI: 1. 88, 3. 21). Additionally, offering women the option of self-sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) testing increased CCS rates by nearly 2 -fold (OR = 1. 71, 95 % CI: 1. 32, 2. 22). We also found that invitation letters alone (or with a follow up phone contact), making an appointment, and sending reminders to patients who are due or overdue for screening had a significant effect on improving participation and CCS rates in populations at risk. Our findings supports the implementation of theory-based cervical cancer educational interventions to increase women's participation in cervical cancer screening programs, particularly when targeting communities with low literacy levels. Additionally, cervical cancer screening programs should consider the option of offering women the opportunity for self-sample collection particularly when such women have not responded to previous screening invitation or reminder letters for Pap smear collection as a method of screening...|$|E

40|$|This report {{undertakes}} a rapid {{review of}} some recent, high quality <b>syntheses</b> <b>and</b> <b>reports</b> to summarise {{the evidence on}} the effectiveness of different types of non-state schools in reaching the marginalised and providing quality education to them. Non-state provision has risen dramatically over the last few decades especially across South and West Asia and the Latin America and Caribbean region and provides opportunities in Sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere. The all-encompassing term ‘non-state’ constitutes a spectrum of providers with different characteristics, scope and scale. Overall, the evidence is indicative of potential improvements in learning outcomes in certain types of non-state provision but this is caveated by the very low overall learning outcomes across education systems, {{as well as by the}} extent to which non-state provision is aligned with human rights. There is evidence of certain types of non-state providers being able to reach the marginalised and disadvantaged more effectively but questions exist with regards to their sustainability. Whilst different types of arrangements may work in different contexts, the critical factor remains the governments’ ability to both foster an enabling environment but also combine it with effective legislation, monitoring and regulation to ensure quality education provision...|$|R
5000|$|The Principal Triangulation of Britain was {{the first}} high {{precision}} trigonometric survey of the whole of Great Britain (including Ireland), carried out between 1791 and 1853 {{under the auspices of}} the Board of Ordnance. The aim of the survey was to establish precise geographical coordinates of almost 300 significant landmarks which could be used as the fixed points of local topographic surveys from which maps could be drawn. In addition there was a purely scientific aim in providing precise data for geodetic calculations such as the determination of the length of Meridian arcs and the Figure of the Earth. Such a survey had been proposed by William Roy (1726-1790) on his completion of the Anglo-French Survey but it was only after his death that the Board of Ordnance initiated the trigonometric survey, motivated by military considerations in a time of a threatened French invasion. Most of the work was carried out under the direction of Isaac Dalby, William Mudge and Thomas Frederick Colby, but the final <b>synthesis</b> <b>and</b> <b>report</b> (1858) was the work of Alexander Ross Clarke.

40|$|Driven by {{the need}} for new cathode battery {{materials}} with high energy density, fluorides have emerged as promising candidates due to their high voltages. From high throughput computations, dirutile LiMnF 4 was identified as a promising cathode with a high conversion voltage and a theoretical specific capacity of 584 mAh/g. In this work, we study the formation of dirutile LiMnF 4 through a new, low-temperature <b>synthesis</b> route <b>and</b> <b>report</b> its electrochemical properties. We also report the discovery of a new rutile polymorph of LiMnF 4 which has Li-Mn disorder on the cation site. Electron diffraction confirmed both dirutile and rutile LiMnF 4 to convert upon lithiation with different reaction paths. As seen with other fluoride materials, specific capacity is strongly linked with <b>synthesis</b> <b>and</b> processing conditions. With LiMnF 4, there was a tradeoff in maintaining phase-pure samples and optimizing samples for high specific capacity. Still, even with very simple <b>synthesis</b> <b>and</b> electrode preparation methods, both rutile and dirutile polymorphs of LiMnF 4 show electrochemical activity.
