50|$|A {{problem was}} {{discovered}} very {{late in the}} development of the TXE4 in that an equipment number could be threaded with the wrong <b>directory</b> <b>number</b> by mistake on the cyclic stores. Even worse it could be the <b>directory</b> <b>number</b> of another equipment number leading to multiple <b>directory</b> <b>numbers.</b> This would cause Number Unobtainable (NU) tone when the incorrectly threaded number was dialled and the double threading number received incorrect calls. The exchange had no way of detecting this but the programming of one of the MCUs allowed a separate programme to run to detect this problem and print out the locations of the duplicates. This had to be done on a regular basis. Eventually, after many more diagnostic routines had been added, this became known as Tester 299A, even though it was only software.|$|R

40|$|There is a {{multitude}} of seller-centric e-marketplaces in the Business-to-Business Electronic Commerce (B 2 B EC) environment. As the name implies, they are not organized from the buying organization 2 ̆ 7 s point of view. Thus, the buying organization needs to define a buyer-centric directory from the external e-marketplaces. This is particularly important in desk-top purchasing systems that use the internalized e-catalog. Recently, the one-to-one e-catalog approach is attempted to allow the buyer to select a sub-directory from a seller 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>directory.</b> Although this is a helpful screening capability, there are still several problems to be resolved such as the mismatched level of details, directory depths unbalance, and changed category names. In addition, the integration with multiple sellers 2 ̆ 7 e-catalogs and maintaining consistency with the dynamically changing sellers 2 ̆ 7 e-catalogs should be supported. To overcome these problems, we adopt the logic programming approach because it can represent the structures of both buyers 2 ̆ 7 and sellers 2 ̆ 7 directories. Predicates as directory definition language can effectively represent the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s extraction of relevant parts from sellers 2 ̆ 7 directories. The crudely selected directory can be modified using five directory modification rules. To control the application of these rules, we devised a top-down control algorithm. The algorithm could improve the depth and balance of the directory significantly, which will result in automatically generating more effective buyer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>directory...</b>|$|R
50|$|Analogue mobile {{telephones}} were notorious for {{their lack of}} security. Casual listeners easily heard conversations as plain narrowband FM; eavesdroppers with specialized equipment readily intercepted handset Electronic Serial Numbers (ESN) and Mobile <b>Directory</b> <b>Numbers</b> (MDN or CTN, the Cellular Telephone Number) over the air. The intercepted ESN/MDN pairs would be cloned onto another handset and used in other regions for making calls. Due to widespread fraud, some carriers required a PIN before making calls or used a system of radio fingerprinting to detect the clones.|$|R
50|$|Before 1992, {{telephone}} numbers {{would consist of}} a 2 or 3-digit area code, and a 5 or 6-digit subscriber number. Example: (067) 85 000 and (04) 66 00 00. In that year, a closed telephone numbering plan was adopted, with eight-digit {{telephone numbers}} incorporating the area code and full number dialling for local and national calls. Service numbers were to be three digits long, <b>Directory</b> <b>numbers</b> four digits and some companies were allocated five-digit numbers, ex. 07575.GSM telephony was introduced in 1993, and those numbers always start with the digit '4' or '9'.|$|R

50|$|The {{choice of}} the main type of memory used in the TXE2 (and the TXE4) was {{particularly}} characteristic of the general design philosophy, that the components used had to be of a technology that had been tested over many years. The choice thus went to the 'Dimond ring' type of memory, named after T. L. Dimond of Bell Laboratories, who invented them in 1945. They were large-diameter magnetic ferrite toroidal rings with solenoid windings, through which are threaded writing and reading wires. This set-up is shown fairly clearly in the picture (above) of the Ambergate Calling Number Generator (CNG) and Class of Service (COS) racks. These racks gave the ability to convert a subscriber's <b>directory</b> <b>number</b> into an equipment location identity. This was a considerable innovation in British exchanges, since in Strowger exchanges the <b>directory</b> and equipment <b>numbers</b> {{had to be the}} same.|$|R
