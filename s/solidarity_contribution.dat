He signed a five-year contract, for €46million and the exchange of Eto'o (valued at €20million) and loan of Alexander Hleb (with an option to purchase for a €10million fee), with a €250million release clause, making Ibrahimović worth €66million. The Hleb deal, however, collapsed. Eventually, Ibrahimović cost Barcelona €69.884million, which included other fees.

40|$|Adaptation {{to climate}} change can be an {{inclusive}} and collective, rather than an individual effort. The choice for collective arrangements is tied to a call for solidarity. We distinguish between one-sided (assisting community members in need) and two-sided solidarity (furthering a common interest) and between voluntary and compulsory solidarity. We assess the strength of solidarity {{as a basis for}} adaptation measures in six Dutch water management case studies. Traditionally, Dutch water management is characterized by compulsory two-sided solidarity at the water board level. Since the French times, the state is involved through compulsory national <b>solidarity</b> <b>contributions</b> to avoid societal disruption by major floods. In so far as this furthers a common interest, the contributions qualify as two-sided solidarity, but if it is considered assistance to flood-prone areas, they also qualify as one-sided solidarity. Although the Delta Programme explicitly continues on this path, our case studies show that solidarity continues {{to play an important role}} in Dutch water management in the process of adapting to a changing climate, but that an undifferentiated call for solidarity will likely result in debates over who should pay what and why. Such discussions can lead to cancellation or postponement of adaptation measures, which are not considered to be in the common interest or result in an increased reliance on local solidarity...|$|R

3000|$|The {{innovative}} Chilean UISA program – combining {{social insurance}} with self-insurance – is worth scrutinizing. Unemployment contributions are split between individual UISAs and a solidarity fund. Both workers and employers pay them, the latter both to UISAs and the <b>solidarity</b> fund. Employers’ <b>contributions</b> to UISAs reduce their severance payments obligations, so severance pay is being partly {{replaced by the}} UI program. To stimulate reemployment, benefit recipients first draw resources from their UISAs, and upon depletion, from the solidarity fund. 21 Withdrawals from UISAs are triggered by separation from the employer, regardless of the reason. Withdrawals from the solidarity fund are triggered by insufficient resources on individual accounts, if the claimant satisfies the usual conditions of continuing eligibility under UI (not working, being available for work and searching for job). By 2009, the program had 2.9 million contributors, 78.6 percent of the targeted population (for details of the Chilean program, see Berstein et al. 2012). 22 [...]...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with explicating the role of language in mobilising action through management emails. Situated {{within the context of}} organisational change in a globalised manufacturing business, the project is framed by behavioural observations from management scholars Palmer and Hardy (2000) of mobilisation strategies that utilise linguistic resources since they: (a) involve a sense of obligation or inclination in directives; (b) show how co-operation will produce mutual benefits; (c) construct desired actions as legitimate, beneficial or inevitable; and (d) use past or anticipated meanings, for or against certain actions. Systemic Functional Linguistics is the underlying framework employed to provide a theoretically principled account of the intuitively derived observations from Palmer and Hardy (2000) which are applied to a sample of twenty-seven email texts, through corpus- and text-based analysis. A major finding is that the representation of action is enacted interpersonally through the verbal group. This view complements experientially dominated accounts of the verbal group which focus on the tense system. Further, action is found to be motivated through the negotiation of evaluative stance. By relating the grammar of the verbal group as well as other resources to the discourse semantics of Appraisal, modulation (of obligation or inclination) is found to be enabled by both negative as well as positive judgements of capacity. Specifically, judgements of capacity are re-interpreted as invocations of high obligation as managers seek to mobilise (further) positive performance. The analysis demonstrates that elements in the verbal group (complex) and Appraisal co-opt action through enabling positioning of the writer, in terms of assessing and grading categorical meanings, manipulating interpersonal time, or foregrounding <b>solidarity.</b> A significant <b>contribution</b> to the thesis is an extension of the system of GRADUATION: FOCUS (Hood, 2004 a) through the demonstration of how resources of the verbal group negotiate expectations of appearances and achievements. This study has also extended the resources of GRADUATION: FORCE by applying it to the management context. The practical contribution of the study is that these insights may more explicitly inform management training and enable managers to participate more effectively within their community of practice...|$|R
