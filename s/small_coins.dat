The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity, commonly fatal in dogs through severe hemolytic anemia and liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms.

25|$|In 1953, {{aluminium}} 1-, 2-, and 5-fen coins began {{being struck}} for circulation, and were first introduced in 1955. These depict the national emblem on the obverse (front) {{and the name}} and denomination framed by wheat stocks on the reverse (back). In 1980, brass 1-, 2-, and 5-jiao and cupro-nickel 1-yuan coins were added, although the 1 and 2 jiao were only produced until 1981, with the last 5 jiao and 1 yuan issued in 1985. All jiao coins depicted similar designs to the fen coins while the yuan depicted the Great Wall of China. In 1991, a new coinage was introduced, consisting of an aluminium 1 jiao, brass 5 jiao and nickel-clad-steel 1 yuan. These were smaller than the previous jiao and yuan coins and depicted flowers on the obverse and the national emblem on the reverse. Issuance of the aluminum 1- and 2-fen coins ceased in 1991, {{with that of the}} 5 fen halting in 1994. The <b>small</b> <b>coins</b> were still made for annual uncirculated mint sets in limited quantities, and from the beginning of 2005 the 1-fen coin got {{a new lease on life}} by being issued again every year since then up to present. New designs of the 1 and 5 jiao and 1 yuan were again introduced in between 1999 and 2002, with the 1 jiao being significantly reduced in size. In 2005, the metallic composition of the 1 jiao was changed from aluminum to more durable nickel-plated steel. The frequency of usage of coins varies between different parts of China, with coins typically being more popular in urban areas, and small notes being more popular in rural areas. Older fen and large jiao coins are uncommonly still seen in circulation but are still valid in exchange.|$|E

500|$|By early 1849, most of {{the silver}} coins in {{circulation}} were <b>small</b> <b>coins</b> of the Spanish colonial real, including the [...] "levy" [...] (one real) and [...] "fip" [...] (half real). The levy and fip often passed for twelve and six cents respectively in the Eastern U.S. The mint accepted them as payment at a slightly lower figure, but even so, lost money on the transactions {{as many of the}} pieces were lightweight through wear. The odd denominations of the levy and fip were a convenience, allowing payment or change to be made without the use of cents, which were at that time large, made of copper, and not accepted by the government as legal tender due to their lack of precious metal. In the Western U.S., the levy and fip were accepted as the equivalent of the silver dime and half dime, although the Spanish pieces contained more silver.|$|E

500|$|The silver half disme (as {{the half}} dime, {{pronounced}} the same, was first called) {{was one of}} the denominations prescribed by the Mint Act of 1792; its weight and fineness were set by law. The first pieces under federal authority were half dismes, struck in 1792 in the cellar of John Harper, a saw maker; as the first federal mint was still under construction in Philadelphia, this took place locally at Sixth and Cherry Streets. The dies were engraved by Adam Eckfeldt, who a half-century later recalled the silver for the half dimes was supplied by President George Washington, and that the 1,500 coins struck from the bullion were given to Washington's Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, for distribution to important people, both in the US and overseas. By legend, President Washington supplied silverware from his home, Mount Vernon, to provide bullion for the coins. In his annual message to Congress in late 1792, Washington noted the ongoing construction of a mint building and stated: [...] "There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dimes, the want of <b>small</b> <b>coins</b> in circulation calling the first attention to them." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1792, the Mint {{acquired}} three balances from Eckfeldt, {{who also}} lent the Mint his lathe (used for turning dies). Eckfeldt {{is believed to}} have made the die from which the 1792 half disme, considered by some the first official U.S. coin, was struck—in 1829, a visitor to the Mint met Eckfeldt and later described him as [...] "an artist made the first die used in it". Other later accounts document Eckfeldt's role in this striking: [...] an 1863 auction sold a half disme supposedly given by Eckfeldt to demonstrate his work. Eckfeldt is given as the source for the tradition that the half dismes were struck at the request of President George Washington to be used as presents. Eckfeldt operated his screw press to strike these roughly 1,500 pieces on July 13, 1792. Since the first Philadelphia Mint was still under construction at the time, these coins were produced in the cellar of John Harper, saw maker, at Sixth and Cherry Streets in Philadelphia. [...] In his annual message to Congress late that year, Washington noted the ongoing construction of a mint building and stated: [...] "There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dismes, the want of <b>small</b> <b>coins</b> in circulation calling the first attention to them." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the postwar}} years, the heavy {{production}} of cents was scaled back, as hoarding ceased {{and some of}} the slack was taken up by other base-metal coins. Nevertheless, the various issues of <b>small</b> <b>coins,</b> at that time not redeemed by the government, caused another glut in commerce, which was not completely broken until the Act of March 3, 1871, allowed redemption of cents and other minor coins in lots of $20 or more. Pursuant to this act, over thirty million copper-nickel cents, of both the Indian Head and Flying Eagle designs, were redeemed; the Mint melted these for recoinage. [...] Fifty-five million bronze cents were also sold to the government; beginning in 1874, the Mint re-issued these in response to commercial requests for cents, lowering the demand for new coins. [...] Drops in the price of silver brought coins of that metal, hoarded for a decade or more, back into commerce, also decreasing demand. Between 1866 and 1878, production only occasionally exceeded ten million; the 1877 coin, with a circulation mintage of 852,500, is a rare date for the series. After 1881, there were few redemptions of bronze cents, due to high demand for the denomination, though copper-nickel cents continued to be redeemed and melted.|$|E

500|$|Beginning in 1867, the new Mint Director, Henry Linderman, (Pollock had resigned) {{began to}} {{advocate}} for Congress to authorize redemption of surplus copper and bronze coinage. [...] Although the nickel could be redeemed in lots (permission granted in its authorizing act), there was no provision {{for the government to}} buy back the smaller coins, and with more being issued every year, there were too many small-value coins. Treasury officials insisted the government could not accept the pieces beyond their legal tender limits, even if what was being done was exchanging them for other currency. [...] Under Linderman, the Mint, without any legal authority, purchased $360,000 in bronze coins using three-cent pieces and nickels. [...] Still, millions of two-cent pieces accumulated in the hands of newspaper and transit companies, postmasters, and others who took small payments from the public, and there were complaints to Congress. [...] With the advent of the Grant administration, Pollock returned to office and opposed the redemption proposals. [...] Although he included Pollock's opinions as part of his annual report, Treasury Secretary George S. Boutwell asked Congress to pass a redemption act, and it did so on March3, 1871, allowing for the redemption of minor coinage in lots of not less than $20. It also allowed the Treasury Secretary to discontinue the coinage of any piece redeemed in large numbers. [...] Pursuant to the new law, the Mint in 1871 and 1872 redeemed over 37,000,000 <b>small</b> <b>coins,</b> including two-cent pieces.|$|E
500|$|The first dollar coins, {{known as}} Flowing Hair dollars, were {{issued by the}} Mint {{beginning}} in 1794. By 1800, a majority of depositors requested their bullion be struck as silver dollars, which were then utilizing the Draped Bust design. This contributed to a shortage of small change in circulation, and as a result, the public became increasingly critical of the Mint. Mint Director Elias Boudinot began encouraging depositors to accept fractional coins, {{and the production of}} dollars began to decrease in relation to the smaller coins. Dollar coin production ceased in March 1804, although those pieces bore the date of 1803. In his 1805 report, Mint Director Robert Patterson stated that [...] "he striking of <b>small</b> <b>coins</b> is a measure which has been adopted to accommodate the banks and other depositors, and at their particular request, both with a view of furnishing a supply of small change, and to prevent the exportation of the specie of the United States to foreign countries." [...] Though none had been struck for over two years, Secretary of State James Madison officially suspended silver dollar coinage on May 1, 1806, addressing a letter to Patterson: Sir: In Consequence of a representation from the director of the Bank of the United States that considerable purchases have been made of dollars coined at the mint for the purpose of exporting them, and as it is probable further purchases and exportations will be made the President directs that all the silver to be coined at the mint shall be of small denominations, so that the value of the largest pieces shall not exceed half a dollar.|$|E
