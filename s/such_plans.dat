A 2016 study on Healthcare.gov health plans found a 24 {{percent increase in the}} percentage of ACA plans that lacked standard out-of-network coverage.|$|E
5|$|Flann {{may have}} had the {{intention}} of abandoning the traditional succession to the kingship of Tara, whereby {{the northern and southern}} branches of the Uí Néill held the kingship alternately, but <b>such</b> <b>plans</b> were thwarted when his favoured son Óengus was killed by his son-in-law and eventual successor Niall Glúndub, son of Áed Findliath, on 7 February 915. Flann's other sons raised revolts and his authority collapsed.|$|E

5|$|In its 2000 Global Market Forecast, Airbus {{estimated}} {{the demand for}} 1,235 passenger Very Large Aircraft (VLA), with more than 400 seats : 360 up to 2009 and 875 by 2019. The market is estimated for two decades at more than 1,700 by Airbus and 700 by Boeing since 1999-2000, including freighters. In 2006, industry analysts Philip Lawrence of the Aerospace Research Centre in Bristol anticipated 880 sales by 2025 with Airbus having conducted the most extensive and thorough market analysis of commercial aviation ever undertaken, justifying its VLA plans to design the A380 by the spoke-hub distribution paradigm while Richard Aboulafia of the consulting Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia anticipated 400 {{with the rise of}} mid-size aircraft and market fragmentation reducing them to niche markets, making <b>such</b> <b>plans</b> unjustified in a point-to-point transit model.|$|E

5|$|<b>Such</b> <b>plans</b> {{are subject}} to {{approval}} by the Buenos Aires City Legislature and would mean the annulment {{of many of the}} current expansion plans outlined in Law 670. Some criticisms include the failure of the Peters plan to account for the extension of the Belgrano Sur Line to Constitucion railway station, meaning that Line C's extension to the minor Buenos Aires terminal would be redundant, and that the Retiro Norte node would also be made redundant by the planned Red de Expresos Regionales commuter rail tunnels which are to link the three major railway terminals of the city.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{the first}} Capcom-designed Vs. {{installment}} to be rendered fully in 3D. Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and its graphical characteristics were optimized for the Wii, which prevents the game from being ported to other consoles without completely re-building the game. Niitsuma explained that its Wii exclusivity was also {{due to a lack}} of Capcom fighting games for the console, and because the Wii's casual quality matches the Vs. series trait of accessibility. The producer suggested that porting a sequel would be easier, but that Capcom would gauge the reception of the Wii game before making <b>such</b> <b>plans.</b> On November 7, 2012, Capcom USA's senior vice president Christian Svensson revealed that Capcom's rights with Tatsunoko have lapsed, meaning Capcom is no longer authorized to sell Tatsunoko vs. Capcom physically or digitally.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Irish Free State in December 1922, Irish peers ceased to elect representatives, although those already elected were allowed to serve for life; the last of the temporal peers, The 4th Earl of Kilmorey (a peer from an Ulster family), died in 1961. Disputes then arose as to whether representative peers could still be elected. The Act establishing the Irish Free State was silent on the matter, although the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922 had abolished the office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland, whose involvement was required in the election process; the office of Clerk of the Crown had also been abolished in Ireland. Various Irish peers petitioned the House of Lords for a restoration of their right to elect representatives. In 1962, the Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform rejected <b>such</b> <b>plans.</b> In the next year, when the Peerage Act 1963 (which, among other things, gave all peers in the Peerage of Scotland the right to sit in the House of Lords) was being considered, an amendment to similarly allow Irish peers to attend was defeated, ninety to eight. Instead, the new Act gave all Irish peers the right to stand for election to the House of Commons, and to vote at parliamentary elections.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{some recent}} cases of spatial planning {{at the national}} level. <b>Such</b> <b>planning</b> may be comprehensive, in some rare cases, or sectoral and with a more fuzzy and complex character. The paper concentrates on how <b>such</b> <b>planning</b> {{at the national level}} relates to the planning of major infrastructure in three European states. This reveals the wide range of approaches to <b>such</b> national-level <b>planning,</b> with quite differing arrangements and recent trajectories. The political economic circumstances of recent decades are layered on top of more enduring constitutional and historical–geographical characteristics, to frame the paths taken in each case. It is suggested that current arrangements {{are not likely to be}} up to the challenges now facing planning at this level. More careful academic focus on this level could help to suggest improved approaches...|$|R

25|$|Beyond its direct spending, the US {{government}} is also highly involved in healthcare through regulation and legislation.
