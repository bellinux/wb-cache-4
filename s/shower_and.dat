5|$|Tropical Storm Erika {{originated}} from a tropical wave accompanied by disorganized <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> thunderstorm activity that moved off {{the west coast}} of Africa, near the Cape Verde Islands, on August25. The following day, convection surrounding the wave began to show signs of organization as it tracked westward across the Atlantic. By August28, an area of low pressure developed from the wave. Environmental conditions ahead of the low were favorable for further development of the system. Despite the favorable conditions, the low became increasingly disorganized on August29, with little convection remaining around the center of circulation. The next day, the system quickly became organized, with <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> thunderstorms developing around the center and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted that the low would likely become a tropical depression within 24hours. Although convection was well-organized, the system lacked a defined low-level circulation center, leading to the NHC not issuing advisories on the system at that time.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on August27 {{and reached the}} eastern Pacific on September7. Tracking westward, little development occurred until September18, when associated <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> thunderstorm activity began to increase. Following visible satellite trends, the National Hurricane Center deemed the disturbance organized enough to be declared a tropical depression at 0600UTC on September19, while located about 1,200mi (1930km) west-southwest of {{the southern tip of}} Baja California. In an environment of cool ocean temperatures and stable air, the depression failed to organize as it turned west-northwest. Associated deep convection dissipated, leading to degeneration into a remnant low by 0000UTC on September20. Performing a slow counter-clockwise loop, the remnant low dissipated five days later.|$|E

5|$|Ambassador Bishop clearly {{explained}} his rationale {{to the security}} detail, which was to avoid any impression that they were intervening in the violence in Mogadishu. He feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes {{got the impression that}} the US was intervening in the conflict. To this effect, he requested the Voice of America and BBC broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere in the conflict. The Marines who had been doused in fuel during the refueling were able to take a <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> wash their clothes.|$|E
5|$|By July7, most of {{the deep}} {{convection}} associated with Blanca had dissipated, and the remaining convection was confined to an outer band southeast of the center. Later that day, the system was barely holding on to tropical storm intensity as the center became devoid of <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> thunderstorm activity. A brief burst in convection allowed Blanca to maintain 40mph (65km/h) winds, minimal tropical storm intensity, for several more hours before being downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Dry air began {{impacting}} Nadine on September17, though outflow {{from the}} storm prevented significant weakening. Despite a large flare of deep convection over the northern semicircle, Nadine weakened slightly later that day. Further weakening occurred on the following day, after the burst in deep convection on September17 deteriorated. Later on September18, most of the deep convection dissipated, with the strongest of the remaining <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> thunderstorm activity being located within a band located west and northwest of the center.|$|E
50|$|<b>Showers</b> <b>and</b> {{thunderstorms}} along thunderstorm trains usually {{develop in}} one area of stationary instability, and are advanced along a single path by prevailing winds. Additional <b>showers</b> <b>and</b> storms can also develop when the gust front from a storm collides with warmer air outside of the storm. The same process repeats in the new storms, until overall conditions in the surrounding atmosphere become too stable for support of thunderstorm activity. <b>Showers</b> <b>and</b> storms can also develop along stationary fronts, and winds move them down the front. The showers that often accompany thunderstorms are usually thunderstorms that are not completely developed.|$|R

5|$|Later on August 11, {{the center}} of Etau became {{partially}} devoid of convection, with only a narrow band of <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> thunderstorm activity persisting to the southeast of the center. Increasing wind shear prevented convection from redeveloping and the storm continued to weaken. Early the following day, the JTWC issued their final advisory on Etau as they reported it had weakened to a tropical depression well {{to the east of}} Japan. Roughly 24hours later, the JMA also downgraded the system to a tropical depression. The final advisory on Etau was issued by the JMA early on August14 as it slowly tracked northward.|$|E

5|$|On June21, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off the western coast of Africa. It entered the eastern Pacific on July10, and <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> thunderstorm activity began to increase {{a day later}} as a result. Tracking westward, the wave gradually became better organized; by 1200UTC on July14, the disturbance acquired enough organization to be upgraded to {{a tropical}} depression. Within an environment of moderate wind shear, the low-level center quickly became poorly defined as convection dissipated. Turning west-northwest on July15, the depression entered cooler waters and an increasingly stable airmass, causing the system to degenerate into a remnant low by 0000UTC the following day. The remnant low dissipated a few hours later.|$|E

5|$|On October21, a westward-moving {{tropical}} wave {{entered the}} Caribbean. The wave quickly developed organized convection, indicating that a possible low-pressure area had developed along the wave. Continued development {{led to the}} formation of Tropical Depression Twenty-Five (which would later be named Alpha). The wave continued to move towards the west, producing minimal <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> thunderstorm activity. Once in the southwestern Caribbean, the wave slowed, and convection gradually redeveloped on October25. The next day, with continued organization, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) stated that a tropical depression could develop in the following day or two. At around 18:00UTC, the NHC determined that Tropical Depression Twenty-Six had developed about 105miles (170km) north of the central cost of Panama.|$|E

5|$|To enable spacewalks, Salyut 6 was {{equipped}} with an inward-opening EVA hatch {{on the side of}} the forward transfer compartment, which could be used as an airlock in a similar way to the system used on Salyut 4. This compartment contained two new semi-rigid spacesuits which allowed much greater flexibility than earlier suits, and could be donned within five minutes in case of an emergency. Finally, the station offered considerable improvements in living conditions over previous outposts, with machinery being soundproofed, the crews being provided with designated 'cots' for sleeping and the equipping of the station with a <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> extensive gymnasium.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Claudette {{originated}} from a tropical wave that moved off {{the west coast}} of Africa on August7. On August11, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the wave when it was located roughly 600mi (965km) east of the Lesser Antilles. Disorganized <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> thunderstorm activity was associated with the westward moving wave; however, the NHC did not anticipate further development of the system. By the afternoon of August12, little convective activity remained with the wave. Strong upper-level wind shear created an unfavorable environment for the system to re-organize as it tracked through the eastern Caribbean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Gerald, one {{of three}} typhoons to form from the monsoon trough in early September1987, {{originated}} from an {{area of low pressure}} that developed to the east of the Philippines over the South China Sea. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the low at 06:00UTC on September2, after convection persisted. Two and a half hours later, the agency issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), but almost immediately thereafter, <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> thunderstorm activity rapidly diminished due to decreased poleward outflow and increased wind shear. Despite this, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the system at 00:00UTC on September3. Eight hours later, the TCFA was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa on September12. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic basin with minimal deep convection. By September23, it reached the eastern Pacific Ocean and began increasing in <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> thunderstorm activity over the next few days. While located near Acapulco another burst in convection occurred on September25, likely due to interaction with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Around that time, the National Hurricane Center began Tropical Weather Outlooks (TWOs) on the system, which is information issued every six hours on significant areas of disturbed weather and their potential for development out to 48hours. The tropical wave split on September26, with the northern portion moving northwestward near the southwestern coast of Mexico. By September27, the system had organized deep convection and was producing tropical storm force winds, but data from scatterometers indicated that it lacked a closed circulation. Although TWOs issued on September27 predicted a high probability for development, the chances for tropical cyclogenesis was decreased later that day, due to the system's close proximity to land.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast on September1. Due to entrainment of dry air, the wave struggled to maintain convection as it progressed westwards. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not begin monitoring the system in its Tropical Weather Outlooks until a concentrated {{area of low pressure}} developed about 350mi (560km) east of the Leeward Islands on September8. The convection quickly diminished and mainly consisted of only sporadically bursts of <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> thunderstorm activity. Little change in organization took place as the disturbance tracked through the Bahamas on September11 and September12. However, the disturbance quickly organized and developed more thunderstorm activity while approaching Florida. A tropical depression is estimated to have formed at 06:00UTC on September13, around the time it was making landfall in Jensen Beach, Florida. Within a few hours, a strong band of deep convection formed in the northeast quadrant of the cyclone, though westerly wind shear prevented any significant convection from developing on the western side of the storm.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{was first}} observed near 50°W on August29. Later that day, reconnaissance aircraft flight reported a wind shirt and above average <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> thunderstorm activity, but no low-level circulation. At 0600UTC on August30, a tropical depression developed {{just east of}} the Lesser Antilles. Six hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Ella. The storm moved through the Leeward Islands and entered the Caribbean Sea late on August30. A reconnaissance aircraft into Ella reported sustained winds between 55 and 60mph (95km/h). It was around that time that the Weather Bureau Office in San Juan, Puerto Rico began issuing bulletins and advisories. Ella strengthened into a Category1 hurricane at 1200UTC on August31, six hours later, before becoming a Category2 hurricane. On September1, Ella curved west-northwestward, and by later that day, made landfall on the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti with winds of 110mph (175km/h). However, the storm was operationally thought to have remained offshore.|$|E
5|$|By August30, strong outflow {{developed}} around Luis despite convection remaining {{displaced from}} the low pressure center. Once the shear began to relent, <b>shower</b> <b>and</b> thunderstorm activity redeveloped around the center, allowing the storm to intensify. Around 1800UTC that day, Luis attained Category1 hurricane status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale; however, operationally Luis was not upgraded to a hurricane until 0900UTC on August31. The newly upgraded hurricane steadily intensified as banding features developed around {{the periphery of the}} cyclone. By the morning of August31, cold cloud tops surrounded a developing eye. Around this time, Luis was located due south of the area of high pressure and tracking steadily towards the west-northwest. Further development resulted in the appearance of a ragged eye appearing on visible satellite images. Winds within the eyewall were estimated at 100mph (155km/h), making Luis a low-end Category2 hurricane. Later that day, the storm became increasingly organized, with a symmetrical structure and a well-defined center. The NHC forecast the hurricane to peak as a Category3 hurricane in 36hours before interacting with Hurricane Iris and Tropical Storm Karen.|$|E
