5|$|Typical {{attachment}} development {{begins with}} unlearned infant reactions to social signals from caregivers. The ability to {{send and receive}} social communications through facial expressions, gestures and voice develops with social experience by seven to nine months. This {{makes it possible for}} an infant to interpret messages of calm or alarm from face or voice. At about eight months, infants typically begin to respond with fear to unfamiliar or startling situations, and to look to the faces of familiar caregivers for information that either justifies or soothes their fear. This developmental combination of <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> the emergence of fear reactions results in attachment behavior such as proximity-seeking, if a familiar, sensitive, responsive, and cooperative adult is available. Further developments in attachment, such as negotiation of separation in the toddler and preschool period, depend on factors such as the caregiver's interaction style and ability to understand the child's emotional communications.|$|E
5|$|Mu {{waves are}} thought to be {{indicative}} of an infant’s developing ability to imitate. This is important because the ability to imitate plays a vital {{role in the development of}} motor skills, tool use, and understanding causal information through social interaction. Mimicking is integral in the development of <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> understanding nonverbal cues. Causal relationships can be made through social learning without requiring experience firsthand. In action execution, mu waves are present in both infants and adults before and after the execution of a motor task and its accompanying desynchronization. While executing a goal-oriented action, however, infants exhibit a higher degree of desynchronization than do adults. Just as with an action execution, during action observation infants’ mu waves not only show a desynchronization, but show a desynchronization greater in degree than the one evidenced in adults. This tendency for changes in degree of desynchronization, rather than actual changes in frequency, becomes the measure for mu wave development throughout adulthood, although the most changes take place during the first year of life. Understanding the mechanisms that are shared between action perception and execution in the earliest years of life has implications for language development. Learning and understanding through social interaction comes from imitating movements as well as vowel sounds. Sharing the experience of attending to an object or event with another person can be a powerful force in the development of language.|$|E

Strong <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> can facilitate interpersonal interactions, which can in turn lead to effective job outcomes. Although the change in organizational structures and the importance of <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> have heightened awareness of <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> in organizational outcomes, little is known about what <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> is <b>and</b> its role in influencing work outcomes. In this study, I provide some insight into the definition <b>and</b> measurement of <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> <b>and</b> how <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> influences job <b>and</b> career success outcomes. Based on my review of the <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> literature, I defined <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> as a learnable social behavior used to achieve social goals. Further, I proposed an integrated <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> framework that theorized <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> as a higher-order construct with three sub-factors: social presentation, social scanning, and social flexibility. I conducted three studies to develop a measure of <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> <b>and</b> examine the antecedents <b>and</b> outcomes of <b>social</b> <b>skill.</b> The results, based on over 400 employees, show that personality factors, such as self-monitoring and extraversion, {{have a positive effect on}} <b>social</b> <b>skill.</b> The findings also suggest that <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> successfully predicts the number of mentors, mentoring received, social support, organizational citizenship behavior, and job performance. Finally, the findings indicate that <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> should be operationalized as a higher-order construct. The study provides both theoretical and practical implications for researchers and organizations interested in the development of <b>social</b> <b>skill...</b>|$|R

25|$|Most {{children}} who have their clefts repaired early enough are {{able to have a}} happy youth and social life. Having a cleft palate/lip does not inevitably lead to a psychosocial problem. However, adolescents with cleft palate/lip are at an elevated risk for developing psychosocial problems especially those relating to self-concept, peer relationships and appearance. Adolescents may face psychosocial challenges but can find professional help if problems arise. A cleft palate/lip may impact an individual’s self-esteem, <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> behavior. There is research dedicated to the psychosocial development of individuals with cleft palate. Self-concept may be adversely affected by the presence of a cleft lip or cleft palate, particularly among girls.|$|E
25|$|Some {{disorders}} cause a {{wide array}} of affects, and language impairment is merely one of many possible symptoms. The two major disorders of this type are the autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy. Autism and other autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are disorders in which the patient suffers from decreased <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> lowered mental flexibility. As a result, many patients suffering ASDs also have language problems, arising from both the lack of social interaction and lowered mental flexibility. Epilepsy is a disorder where electrical malfunctions or mis-communications in the brain cause seizures, leading to muscle spasms and activation of other organs and systems of the body. Over time, epilepsy can lead to cognitive and behavioral decay. This mental decay can eventually lead to a loss of language and communication skills.|$|E

Music therapists primarily help clients improve their health in several domains, such as cognitive functioning, motor skills, emotional development, <b>social</b> <b>skills,</b> <b>and</b> quality of life by using both active and passive music experiences such as free improvisation, song, dance, listening, and discussion of music to achieve treatment goals. There is a wide qualitative and quantitative research literature base which incorporates clinical therapy, psychotherapy, biomusicology, musical acoustics, music theory, psychoacoustics, embodied music cognition, aesthetics of music, sensory integration, and comparative musicology. Referrals to music therapy services may be made by other health care professionals. Clients can also choose to pursue music therapy services without a referral (i.e., self-referral).|$|E
25|$|George {{appeared}} before the Old Bailey on 14 December 2007 and again {{pleaded not guilty to}} the murder. His retrial began on 9 June 2008. Initially there was a large amount of coverage in the press, especially of the prosecution portrayal of the defendant as being highly obsessive, lacking in <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> a danger to women. The prosecution case differed from that of the first trial in that there was practically no scientific evidence as the evidence relating to the FDR was ruled inadmissible by the trial judge (Mr Justice Griffith Williams). There was much evidence of George's bad character which was admitted in the re-trial (at the discretion of the trial judge) {{as a result of the}} enactment of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 since the original trial. There were delays due to legal arguments and to the illnesses of the defendant and one of the jurors. For the defence William Clegg QC reminded the jury that evidence from three women from HAFAD (Hammersmith and Fulham Action on Disability) placed the defendant's arrival at their offices at 11:50 or 12:00, which, according to Clegg's argument, would have made it impossible for him to have committed a murder at Dando's house at 11:30 and then gone home (in the wrong direction) to change. Two neighbours who almost certainly saw the murderer immediately after the shooting had seen him go off in this direction, and later failed to identify George at an identification parade. The trial ended with George's acquittal on 1 August 2008.|$|E
