40|$|The {{repeatability}} of the Hamilton Thorne Research IVOS (version 10) semen analyser (dimension <b>specific</b> <b>software,</b> <b>version</b> 3) in {{the evaluation}} of sperm morphology according to strict criteria was investigated in this study. The repeat measures investigated were cell-cell (300 cells, 3 x each), intraslide (20 slides, 3 x each) and interslide (30 samples, 3 slides each), and their normal sperm morphology outcomes were recorded. Semen samples with varying normal sperm morphology percentages were obtained and sperm morphology slides prepared. The slides were stained with Diff-Quik stain. Agreements between evaluations were determined using the κ statistic and average coefficients of variation. The predictive probability for an abnormal cell given a prior abnormal cell outcome was 91 %, and 89 % for a similar prediction of a normal cell. The predictive probabilities for an abnormal or a normal cell given two prior abnormal or two prior normal cell outcomes were 95 % and 94 %, respectively. No significant bias was obtained between the repeat probabilities for normal and abnormal sperm cells. The average coefficients of variation for the intraslide trial were 9. 73 % and 8. 30 % when 100 and 200 sperm cells were evaluated, respectively. The average coefficient of variation for the interslide trial was 15. 39 %. The technical importance of good sample and slide preparation technique has once again been highlighted by this study. A uniform (spatial homogeneity), high concentration (5 - 10 cells per computer screen) smear must be made and the cells stained with optimal intensity (maximum contrast). In a trial in which 2000 cells were evaluated, 19 objects (0. 95 %) were identified as spermatozoa, but were debris. The automated semen analysing system (IVOS) used in this study was shown to maintain a level of repeatability, precision and accuracy acceptable for the application of the system in a routine semen analysis situation.

40|$|Recent work on cache attacks {{has shown}} that CPU caches {{represent}} a powerful source of information leakage. However, existing attacks require manual identification of vulnerabilities, i. e., data accesses or instruction execution depending on secret information. In this paper, we present Cache Template Attacks. This generic attack technique allows us to profile and exploit cachebased information leakage of any program automatically, without prior knowledge of <b>specific</b> <b>software</b> <b>versions</b> or even <b>specific</b> system information. Cache Template Attacks can be executed online on a remote system without any prior offline computations or measurements. Cache Template Attacks consist of two phases. In the profiling phase, we determine dependencies between the processing of secret information, e. g., specific key inputs or private keys of cryptographic primitives, and specific cache accesses. In the exploitation phase, we derive the secret values based on observed cache accesses. We illustrate {{the power of the}} presented approach in several attacks, but also in a useful application for developers. Among the presented attacks is the application of Cache Template Attacks to infer keystrokes and—even more severe—the identification of specific keys on Linux and Windows user interfaces. More specifically, for lower-case only passwords, we can reduce the entropy per character from log 2 (26) = 4. 7 to 1. 4 bits on Linux systems. Furthermore, we perform an automated attack on the T-table-based AES implementation of OpenSSL that is as efficient as state-of-the-art manual cache attacks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Version {{control systems}} (VCS) have become {{indispensable}} to develop software. Next to their immediate advantages, they also offer {{information about the}} evolution of software and its development process. Despite this wealth of information, it has only been leveraged by tools that are dedicated to a <b>specific</b> <b>software</b> engineering task such as predicting bugs or identifying hotspots. General-purpose tool support for reasoning about {{the information contained in}} a version control system is limited. In this paper, we introduce the logic-based program query language ABSINTHE.
