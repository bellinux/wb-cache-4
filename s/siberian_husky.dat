5|$|There {{have been}} a variety of campaigns in other states to select a state dog. Georgia was {{undecided}} over choosing a state dog in 1991, with {{an attempt to make}} the Golden Retriever the official dog failing after a vote in the Georgia State Senate; an opposing campaign promoted the Bulldog, the mascot of the University of Georgia. The campaign to make the <b>Siberian</b> <b>Husky</b> the Washington state dog failed in the Washington House of Representatives in 2004.|$|E
25|$|The phrase three dog night, {{meaning it}} is so cold you would need three dogs in bed with you to keep warm, {{originated}} with the Chukchi people of Siberia, who kept the <b>Siberian</b> <b>husky</b> landrace dog that became the modern purebred breed of <b>Siberian</b> <b>Husky.</b>|$|E
25|$|The role of Diefenbaker {{was played}} in the pilot movie by a mixed breed named Newman, then {{in the rest of}} seasons 1 and 2 by a {{purebred}} <b>Siberian</b> <b>Husky</b> named Lincoln. When the show was brought back for season 3, Lincoln was replaced by another purebred <b>Siberian</b> <b>Husky</b> named Draco, whose sister, Cinder, did most of his stunts. A variety of stunt dogs were used throughout the series, and fake dogs have also been used in some scenes.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, a {{study using}} {{a number of}} genetic markers {{indicated}} that the <b>Siberian</b> <b>Husky,</b> the Alaskan Malamute and the Alaskan husky share a close genetic relationship between each other and were related to Chukotka sled dogs from Siberia. They were separate to the two Inuit dogs, the Canadian Eskimo Dog and the Greenland dog. In North America, the <b>Siberian</b> <b>Husky</b> and the Malamute both had maintained their Siberian lineage and had {{contributed significantly to the}} Alaskan husky, which showed evidence of crossing with European breeds that were consistent with this breed being created in post-colonial North America.|$|E

25|$|Analyses of the {{mitochondrial}} DNA of 1576 dogs worldwide {{revealed that}} one Kishu and one <b>Siberian</b> <b>husky</b> possessed the same haplotype as a Japanese wolf, indicating past cross-breeding. A more-refined study of Japanese wolf mitochondrial DNA showed {{that they could}} be further divided into two separate groups, and that the sequences from one Kishu, one <b>Siberian</b> <b>husky</b> and one Shiba Inu could also be divided into the two groups. These dogs correspond to clade F of the mDNA phylogenetic tree among worldwide dogs, with clade F haplogroup dogs originating from a rare admixture between male dogs and more than one female ancestor of Japanese wolves, which have contributed to the dog gene pool.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{superficial}} keratitis (pannus) {{is a form}} of superficial keratitis, or {{inflammation of}} the cornea, found most commonly in German Shepherds, Greyhounds, and <b>Siberian</b> <b>Huskies.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} <b>Siberian</b> <b>Huskies</b> were bred by the Chukchi people [...] whose hunter-gatherer culture {{relied on}} their help. It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, whose ancestors {{lived in the}} extremely cold and harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic. William Goosak, a Russian fur trader, introduced them to Nome, Alaska during the Nome Gold Rush, initially as sled dogs. The people of Nome referred to the <b>Siberian</b> <b>Huskies</b> as [...] "Siberian Rats" [...] due to their size of 40–50 lbs. compared with the Malamute dogs, 75–85 lbs.|$|R
50|$|Chronic {{superficial}} keratitis is {{most commonly}} seen in German Shepherd Dogs, {{but it is}} also found in Belgian Tervurens, Greyhounds, <b>Siberian</b> <b>Huskies,</b> Australian Shepherds, and Border Collies.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Siberian</b> <b>Husky</b> (Russian: Сибирский хаски) is {{a medium}} size working dog breed that {{originated}} in north-eastern Siberia, Russia. The breed {{belongs to the}} Spitz genetic family. It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{of these}} landraces {{in modern times}} have been {{selectively}} bred and registered with various kennel clubs as modern purebred breeds, including the <b>Siberian</b> <b>Husky</b> and the Labrador Husky. The Sakhalin Husky is a Japanese sled dog related to the Japanese Spitz and the Akita Inu.|$|E
25|$|The first dogs {{arrived in}} the Americas 12,000 years ago; however, people and their dogs did not settle in the Arctic until the Paleo-Eskimo people 4,500 years ago and then the Thule people 1,000 years ago, both {{originating}} from Siberia. The <b>Siberian</b> <b>Husky</b> was originally developed by the Chukchi people of the Chukchi Peninsula in eastern Siberia. They were brought to Nome, Alaska, in 1908 for sled-dog racing.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, a new {{designer}} cross emerged {{called the}} Pomsky, {{which is a}} cross of a Pomeranian and a <b>Siberian</b> <b>Husky,</b> and became popular and sought after. This cross also has its own fancier associations. This mix is currently a popular designer cross because of the miniature husky-like appearance. There are images that have been circulated of small breed dogs which are mistakenly identified as the Pomsky cross, but often are actually a Finnish Lapphund, a Shiba Inu, or an Alaskan Klee Kai.|$|E
25|$|Brooks is {{descended from}} the Yup'ik Eskimos and Athabascan Indians, two of the {{indigenous}} groups who {{were the first to}} mush dogs in Alaska. His grandfather, Gareth Wright, was a competitive musher who won both major Alaskan sled dog races of the 1940s, the American Championship (twice), and the Fur Rendezvous World Championship (three times). Wright was also a dog breeder and kennel owner who became known for breeding the Wright's Aurora Husky from the Irish Setter, the St. Lawrence <b>Siberian</b> <b>Husky,</b> and village dogs.|$|E
25|$|A {{dog that}} completes a {{championship}} (called a finished champion) {{may continue to}} be entered in shows to compete for Group (winner of its group) or Best In Show (BIS) honors. A finished dog that continues to compete is called a special. Owners of Best in Show winners may add BIS or Multi BIS (multiple best in show winners) to their dog's name, as in the <b>Siberian</b> <b>Husky</b> Multi BIS/Ch Phoebe Run To Phoebus. Many prestigious shows only accept entries from dogs that have finished their championships.|$|E
500|$|Dogs in the Yukon Quest come in {{a variety}} of sizes and breeds, though the most common are Alaskan and <b>Siberian</b> <b>Huskies</b> {{weighing}} between 45pounds (20kg) and 70pounds (32kg). The Alaskan Husky is not a recognized breed, but an amalgam of several different types bred for speed, stamina, and strength. <b>Siberian</b> <b>Huskies</b> are a breed recognized by the American Kennel Club and are characterized by thick coats, stiff ears, a fox-like tail, and medium size. <b>Siberian</b> <b>Huskies</b> are typically larger and slower than their Alaskan counterparts, causing mushers to nickname the breed [...] "Slowberians", but have more pulling power. The difference was seen during the 1998 Yukon Quest, when Bruce Lee's team of Alaskan Huskies competed against André Nadeau's team of Siberians. Lee's team was faster than Nadeau's over short stretches, but Lee had to rest more often. Nadeau had a head start out of the final checkpoint, but Lee was able to overtake and pass him.|$|R
25|$|In first-generation hybrids, gray wolves {{are most}} often crossed with wolf-like dogs (such as German Shepherds, <b>Siberian</b> <b>Huskies,</b> and Alaskan Malamutes) for an {{appearance}} most appealing to owners desiring an exotic pet.|$|R
50|$|Modern <b>Siberian</b> <b>Huskies</b> {{registered}} in the US are largely {{the descendants of the}} 1930 Siberia imports and of Leonhard Seppala’s dogs, particularly Togo. The limited number of registered foundational dogs has led to some discussion about their vulnerability to the founder effect.|$|R
25|$|Nearly all dogs' genetic {{closeness}} to the gray wolf {{is due to}} admixture. However, several Arctic breeds also show a genetic closeness with the now-extinct Taimyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture: the <b>Siberian</b> <b>Husky</b> and Greenland dog (which are also historically associated with Arctic human populations) {{and to a lesser}} extent, the Shar Pei and Finnish spitz. An admixture graph of the Greenland dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material; however, an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data and indicates admixture between the Taimyr wolf and the ancestors these four high-latitude breeds.|$|E
25|$|The {{study found}} {{distinct}} genetic clusters within modern dogs that largely corresponded to phenotype or function. These included spitz-breeds, toy dogs, spaniels, Mastiff-like breeds, small terriers, retrievers, herding dogs, scent-hounds and sight-hounds. There were 17breeds that conflicted with phenotype or function {{and these were}} thought {{to be the result of}} crossing some of the other phenotypes. As in a 2004 study that found 9‘ancient breeds’ to be genetically divergent, the study found 13breeds that were genetically divergent from the modern breeds: the Basenji, Saluki, Afghan hound, Samoyed, Canaan dog, New Guinea singing dog, dingo, Chow Chow, Chinese Shar Pei, Akita, Alaskan malamute, <b>Siberian</b> <b>husky</b> and American Eskimo dog. Results also indicated that the Basenji had recent admixture with Middle Eastern wolves.|$|E
25|$|Swenson is {{sometimes}} erroneously credited with introducing the <b>Siberian</b> <b>Husky</b> to the United States. He was an enthusiastic dogsledder who regularly used sled dogs {{in his work}} and made at least two long treks. He wrote about selecting dogs for enthusiasm and stamina and about {{the characteristics of a}} good lead dog. It is not clear whether Swenson's favorite lead dog Billkoff ever reached the United States. There were Siberian sled dogs in Alaska since 1908 and the early importers are known. Swenson imported Chukchi dogs for Leonhard Seppala in 1927 and for Seppala's collaborator Elizabeth (Peg) Ricker in 1930. These dogs are believed to have been the last Siberian sled dogs exported for many years. The Ricker dogs were used a working team by the crew of the Nanuk in 1929-30.|$|E
50|$|With {{the help}} of <b>Siberian</b> <b>Huskies,</b> entire tribes of people were able not only to survive, but to push forth into terra incognita. Admiral Robert Peary of the United States Navy was aided by this breed during his expeditions {{in search of the}} North Pole.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 Andrews {{moved with}} he husband Nigel to Norway, {{spending}} {{much of her}} time at Norwegian training bases as well as returning to her home in Andover, Hampshire. Andrews owns a kennel of Alaskan <b>Huskies</b> and <b>Siberian</b> <b>Huskies.</b> She is the co-owner and a guide of the extreme adventure company Dogsledding Expeditions.|$|R
50|$|Rakes are {{important}} grooming tools especially for double-coated dogs {{such as the}} Newfoundlands or <b>Siberian</b> <b>Huskies.</b> They are good in removing dead hair from the undercoat. The undercoat rake's teeth are especially designed to penetrate through the overcoat down into the thick undercoat to remove loose hair faster and easier than a standard comb. Rakes {{can also be used}} for untangling and dematting.|$|R
25|$|Nearly all dog breeds' genetic {{closeness}} to the gray wolf {{is due to}} admixture. However, several Arctic dog breeds show a genetic closeness with the now-extinct Taymyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture. These breeds are associated with high latitudes - the <b>Siberian</b> <b>husky</b> and Greenland dog that are also associated with Arctic human populations, {{and to a lesser}} extent the Shar Pei and Finnish spitz. An admixture graph of the Greenland dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material; however, an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data. This indicates admixture between the Taymyr wolf population and the ancestral dog population of these 4 high-latitude breeds. This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, a {{study showed}} that 9,000 YBP the {{domestic}} dog was present at what is now Zhokhov Island, arctic north-eastern Siberia, however this area {{was connected to the}} mainland then. The dogs were selectively bred as either sled dogs or as hunting dogs, which implies that a sled dog standard and a hunting dog standard existed at that time. The optimal maximum size for a sled dog is 20–25kg based on themo-regulation, and the ancient sled dogs were between 16–25kg. The same standard has been found in the remains of sled dogs from this region 2,000 YBP and in the modern <b>Siberian</b> <b>husky</b> breed standard. Other dogs were more massive at 30kg and appear to be dogs that had been crossed with wolves and used for polar bear hunting. At death, the heads of the dogs had been carefully separated from their bodies by humans and is thought to be for ceremonial reasons.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparison}} of the ancestry of the Taimyr-1 lineage to the dog lineage indicated that some modern dog breeds have a closer association with either the gray wolf or Taimyr-1 due to admixture. The Saarloos wolfdog showed more association with the gray wolf, which is {{in agreement with the}} documented historical crossbreeding with gray wolves in this breed. Taimyr-1 shared more alleles (i.e. gene expressions) with those breeds that are associated with high latitudes - the <b>Siberian</b> <b>husky</b> and Greenland dog that are also associated with arctic human populations, {{and to a lesser extent}} the Shar Pei and Finnish spitz. An admixture graph of the Greenland dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material, although an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data. This indicates admixture between the Taimyr-1 population and the ancestral dog population of these four high-latitude breeds. These results can be explained either by a very early presence of dogs in northern Eurasia or by the genetic legacy of Taimyr-1 being preserved in northern wolf populations until the arrival of dogs at high latitudes. This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates that the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.|$|E
50|$|Assembling a dog sled team {{involves}} picking leader dogs, point dogs, swing dogs, and wheel dogs. The lead dog is crucial, so mushers take particular care {{of these}} dogs. Another important detail is to have powerful wheel dogs to pull the sled out from the snow. Point dogs (optional) are located behind the leader dogs, swing dogs between the point and wheel dogs, and team dogs are all other dogs in between the wheel and swing dogs and are selected for their endurance, strength and speed {{as part of the}} team. In dog sledding, <b>Siberian</b> <b>Huskies</b> or Alaskan Malamutes are the main types of dogs that are used for recreational sledding because of their strength and speed and endurance as well as their ability to withstand the cold. However, Alaskan Huskies (a mix between <b>Siberian</b> <b>Huskies</b> and Alaskan Malamutes) are also a popular dog for sled dog racing, because of their endurance, good eating habits, speed, and dedication to running even when tired.|$|R
40|$|Cryptorchidism {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{developmental}} defects in purebred dogs. Single gene markers (called SNPs) are being used to investigate the associations in <b>Siberian</b> <b>huskies</b> between candidate genes (INSL 3, LGR 8, ESR 1, HOXA 10, MIS, CGRP and other positional candidates) and cryptorchidism. Findings of causative mutations in candidate genes will be useful in dog breeding programs to reduce the incidence of cryptorchidism...|$|R
50|$|In 1998, the USDA {{estimated}} {{an approximate}} population of 300,000 wolfdogs in the United States (the highest {{of any country}} worldwide), with some other sources giving a population possibly as high as 500,000. In first-generation hybrids, gray wolves are most often crossed with wolf-like dogs (such as German Shepherds, <b>Siberian</b> <b>Huskies,</b> and Alaskan Malamutes) for an appearance most appealing to owners desiring an exotic pet.|$|R
