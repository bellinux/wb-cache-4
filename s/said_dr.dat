500|$|After his death, {{the autopsy}} report {{revealed}} that Jackson had a strong heart and was a [...] "fairly healthy" [...] 50-year-old. According to BBC, his weight was in the acceptable range {{for a man of}} his height, but he had punctured arms and suffered from lung damage and some arthritis. The document shows that Jackson's most serious health problem was his chronically inflamed lungs, but this was not serious enough to be a contributing factor to his death. The post mortem did not uncover any physical problems that may [...] have limited Jackson's ability to perform. [...] "His overall health was fine," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Dr.</b> Zeev Kain of the University of California, who reviewed the report for AP but was not involved in the post-mortem examination, [...] "The results are in normal limits." [...] The autopsy also revealed that he was partially bald and that his lips, eyebrows, and scalp were tattooed.|$|E

500|$|Doggystyle was {{recorded}} in early-1993 at Death Row Studios. It was produced in a style similar to The Chronic; some critics called it a [...] "carbon copy". Snoop Doggy Dogg collaborated with two music groups, 213 and Tha Dogg Pound. Daz Dillinger, of the latter group, accused Dr. Dre of taking sole recognition for producing the album and alleged that Warren G and himself contributed substantially {{to the production of}} the project. Death Row Records co-founder Marion [...] "Suge" [...] Knight stated in 2013 that, [...] "Daz pretty much did the whole album", and that credit was signed over to Dr. Dre for a fee. Snoop Doggy Dogg <b>said</b> <b>Dr.</b> Dre was capable of making beats without the help of collaborators and addressed the issues with Warren G and Daz, stating [...] "They made beats, Dre produced that record". He discussed the track [...] "Ain't No Fun", mentioning that Daz and Warren G brought Dr. Dre the beat but [...] "Dre took that muthafucka to the next level!"

500|$|Caligari, like {{a number}} of Weimar films that {{followed}} it, thematizes brutal and irrational authority by making a violent and possibly insane authority figure its antagonist. Kracauer <b>said</b> <b>Dr.</b> Caligari was symbolic of the German war government and fatal tendencies inherent in the German system, saying the character [...] "stands for an unlimited authority that idolizes power as such, and, to satisfy its lust for domination, ruthlessly violates all human rights and values". Likewise, John D. Barlow described Dr. Caligari {{as an example of}} the tyrannical power and authority that had long plagued Germany, while Cesare represents the [...] "common man of unconditional obedience". Janowitz has claimed Cesare represents the common citizen who is conditioned to kill or be killed, just as soldiers are trained during their military service, and that Dr. Caligari is symbolic of the German government sending those soldiers off to die in the war. The control Dr. Caligari yields over the minds and actions of others results in chaos and both moral and social perversion. Cesare lacks any individuality and is simply a tool of his master; Barlow writes that he is so dependent on Caligari that he falls dead when he strays too far from the source of his sustenance, [...] "like a machine that has run out of fuel".|$|E
500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Robert Christgau from The Village Voice found Dr. Dre's lyrics distastefully misogynistic, writing [...] "it's a New Millennium, but he's Still S.L.I.M.E. ... For an hour, with time {{out for some}} memorable Eminem tracks, Dre degrades women every way he can think of, all of which involve his dick." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot <b>said</b> <b>Dr.</b> Dre's production boasted unique elements but [...] "the endless gangsta babble, with its casual misogyny and flippant violence," [...] sounded flagrantly trite. AllMusic's Erlewine spoke of how the number of guest rappers affected the album, and questioned his reasons for collaborating with [...] "pedestrian rappers". He claimed that [...] "the album suffers considerably as a result [...] ". Erlewine criticized the lyrics, which he said were repetitive and full of [...] "gangsta clichés". Sinclair mentioned similar views of the lyrics, calling them [...] "filthy", but noted [...] "none of [...] should diminish Dre's achievement". NME spoke of how the lyrics were too explicit, stating, [...] "As the graphic grooves stretch out, littered with gunfire, bombings and 'copters over Compton, and the bitch-beating baton is handed from Knock-Turnal to Kurupt, 2001 reaches gangsta-rap parody-level with too many tracks coming off like porno-Wu outtakes."
