There have been many GNSS spoofing detection methods, and each of them focuses on a characteristic of the GNSS signal or a measurement that the receiver has obtained.

This paper proposes a practical method of detections’ fusion based on an approach to assign the belief function for spoofing detections. The frame of discernment is simplified, and the hard decision of hypothesis testing is replaced by the soft decision; then, the belief functions for some detections can be evaluated.

40|$|Face {{recognition}} {{has been}} the focus of attention for the past couple of decades and, as a result, a significant progress has been made in this area. However, the problem of <b>spoofing</b> <b>attacks</b> can challenge face biometric systems in practical applications. In this paper, an effective countermeasure against face <b>spoofing</b> <b>attacks</b> based on a kernel discriminant analysis approach is presented. Its success derives from different innovations. First, it is shown that the recently proposed multiscale dynamic texture descriptor based on binarized statis- tical image features on three orthogonal planes (MBSIF-TOP) is effective in detecting <b>spoofing</b> <b>attacks,</b> showing promising perfor- mance compared with existing alternatives. Next, by combining MBSIF-TOP with a blur-tolerant descriptor, namely, the dynamic multiscale local phase quantization (MLPQ-TOP) representation, the robustness of the <b>spoofing</b> <b>attack</b> detector can be further improved. The fusion of the information provided by MBSIF-TOP and MLPQ-TOP is realized via a kernel fusion approach based on a fast kernel discriminant analysis (KDA) technique.

This result was obtained under a ‘worst-case’ scenario, by assuming that the distribution of fake scores is identical to that of genuine scores (i. e. the attacker {{is assumed to be}} able to perfectly replicate a genuine biometric trait). This assumption also allows one to evaluate the robustness of score fusion rules against <b>spoofing</b> <b>attacks,</b> and to design robust fusion rules, without the need of actually fabricating <b>spoofing</b> <b>attacks.</b> However, whether and to what extent the ‘worst-case’ scenario is representative of real <b>spoofing</b> <b>attacks</b> is still an open issue. In this study, we address this issue by an experimental investigation carried out on several data sets including real <b>spoofing</b> <b>attacks,</b> related to a multimodal verification system based on face and fingerprint biometrics. On the one hand, our results confirm that multimodal systems are vulnerable to attacks against a single biometric trait. On the other hand, they show that the ‘worst-case’ scenario can be too pessimistic.
