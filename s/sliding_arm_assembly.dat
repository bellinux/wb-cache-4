40|$|A SAT-based bounded model checker is {{developed}} to verify safety properties of simple concurrent <b>ARM</b> <b>assembly</b> programs and their abstracts over predicates. Transition relations for both concrete systems and abstract systems are built automatically {{according to the}} operational semantics of instructions and control flow of the programs. The unfolded transition relations (within a specific interval) along with safe properties are represented by a logical formula that is then dumped to a SAT solver for satisfiability check. Predicate abstraction is calculated using a SAT solver rather than making calls to a theorem prover. We show the application of these techniques to realistic concurrent <b>ARM</b> <b>assembly</b> programs. We also explore how to adjust the model checker to relaxed memory consistent models. 1...|$|R

Indications for use The SenoScan ® Full-Field Digital Mammography System is a {{dedicated}} mammography system intended to produce radiographic {{images of the}} human breast {{for the purpose of}} diagnostic and screening mammography. The SenoScan ® Full-Field Digital Mammography system is intended {{to be used in the}} same clinical applications as traditional film-based mammographic systems. III. Device Description The SenoScan ® Full-Field Digital Mammography System (SenoScan®) includes a digital image receptor combined with a conventional mammographic X-ray device except for the collimator. The system consists of a dual filament x-ray tube, slit-collimator, x-ray generator, support <b>arm,</b> support <b>assembly,</b> compression device and CCD digital detector with readout equipment. The <b>arm</b> <b>assembly</b> consists of an X-ray tube on one end and a digital detector on the other end. The entire <b>arm</b> <b>assembly</b> pivots at the focal spot of the x-ray tube as the detector scans from left to right. The slit-collimator shapes the beam and limits the x-ray beam to the 1 -cm active width of the detector. This results in images with very little scatter and no dose penalty associated with absorption of primary radiation by a grid...|$|R

40|$|The sup-pf- 2 {{mutation}} is {{a member}} of a group of dynein regulatory mutations that are capable of restoring motility to paralyzed central pair or radial spoke defective strains. Previous work has shown that the flagellar beat frequency is reduced in sup-pf- 2, but little else was known about the sup-pf- 2 phenotype (Huang, B., Z. Ramanis, and D. J. L. Luck. 1982. Cell. 28 : 115 - 125; Brokaw, C. J., and D. J. L. Luck. 1985. Cell Motil. 5 : 195 - 208). We have reexamined sup-pf- 2 using improved biochemical and structural techniques and by the analysis of additional sup-pf- 2 alleles. We have found that the sup-pf- 2 mutations are associated with defects in the outer dynein arms. Biochemical analysis of sup-pf- 2 - 1 axonemes indicates that both axonemal ATPase activity and outer arm polypeptides are reduced by 40 - 50 % when compared with wild type. By thin-section EM, these defects correlate with an approximately 45 % loss of outer dynein arm structures. Interestingly, this loss is biased toward a subset of outer doublets, resulting in a radial asymmetry that may reflect some aspect of outer <b>arm</b> <b>assembly.</b> The defects in outer <b>arm</b> <b>assembly</b> do not appear to result from defects in either the outer doublet microtubules or the outer arm docking structures, but rather appear to result from defects in outer dynein arm components. Analysis of new sup-pf- 2 mutations indicates that the severity of the outer <b>arm</b> <b>assembly</b> defects varies with different alleles. Complementation tests and linkage analysis reveal that the sup- pf- 2 mutations are alleles of the PF 28 /ODA 2 locus, which is thought to encode the gamma-dynein heavy chain subunit of the outer arm. The sup- pf- 2 mutations therefore appear to alter the activity of the outer dynein arms by modification of the gamma-dynein heavy chain...|$|R
