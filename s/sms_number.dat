It was funded by an EPSRC Partnership in Public Awareness Award. The campaign used a poster carrying both the URL of a custom designed web site (www. bristolsays. com) and an <b>SMS</b> <b>number.</b> This poster was displayed {{on the sides of}} buses travelling through the centre of Bristol and its message was targeted at pedestrians and car drivers. The purpose of the campaign was to discover whether this approach would draw the target audiences into contributing their views about what should be done to reduce urban pollution. Additional feedback was gathered using face-to-face interviews and a questionnaire created by Bristol City Council that was available on the project web site (www. bristolsays. com) for direct submission to the Council. By these means the project added value to a public consultation on sustainability options for Bristol that was being carried out by the Council's Sustainable City Unit from October to December 2003. These links meant that the potential impact of the project team members' research was not only communicated to the public but also key decision makers within local government, including senior local politicians. The project was also the starting point for a project that led directly to an ESRC's Science in Society scheme award to investigate in greater detail the approaches taken by English Local Authorities to consulting the public on issues with scientific content research, like the management of air quality. www. uwe. ac. uk/fas/graphicscience/projects/evaluations/eval_signposting. ht...|$|E

Areas with the highest AKI and AKB are SampangRegency. Looking at the empirical conditions, it is necessary toidentify the factors that led to the high AKI and AKB in SampangRegency. There is an existing health policy in Sampang districtthrough LIBAS (Lima Bebas) 2 +, but it needs to be monitoredand evaluated to ensure policy implementation went well. Thisstudy aims to assess the implementation of the Libas programsand identify socio-cultural factors that influence health policyimplementation. Methods: This study used qualitative methods that took placeat the Puskesmas Camplong, Sampang Regency. Informantswere selected purposively. The research data was collectedby participating observation, in-depth interviews, and focusgroup discussions. The finding was analyzed using descriptiveanalysis. Results: Sociologically, the implementation of policy to reduceAKI and AKB in Sampang Regency is one of which is influencedby the shaman midwife partnerships, especially in the deliveryprocess.

40|$|This {{research}} investigates third harmonic injection {{applied to}} a modular multilevel converter (MMC) to generate a higher DC voltage. This is achieved using a proposed novel control scheme that activates existing submodules (SMs) in the converter arms. The technique is fundamentally different to, and does the reverse of, the well-known third harmonic injection techniques utilized to increase the AC output voltage in three-phase converter systems for a given DC link voltage. In the proposed scheme, the <b>number</b> of inserted <b>SMs</b> in each converter leg {{is greater than the}} <b>number</b> of <b>SMs</b> per arm, whence the MMC can operate with a higher DC link voltage while the <b>SM</b> <b>number</b> per arm and their capacitor voltages remain unchanged. This lowers the DC current and the DC transmission loss is significantly reduced by 22 %. Station conduction losses with the operational scheme are lowered by 2. 4 %. The semiconductor current stresses are also lowered due to the reduced DC component of arm currents. Additionally, the phase energy variation is reduced by 18 %, which benefits circulating current control. The operating principles are presented in detail and mathematical models for conduction losses, energy variation, and circulating voltage are derived.

In this note we analyze the QCD corrections for long-range mechanisms (LRM), due to diagrams with light-neutrino exchange between a Standard Model (V-A) ×(V-A) and a beyond the <b>SM</b> lepton <b>number</b> violating vertex. We argue that in contrast to the SRM in the LRM case, there is no operator mixing from color-mismatched operators.
