40|$|Inner {{and outer}} panel of {{automobile}} doors, trunks and hoods are joined via hem flange bonding. During the hemming process, air-filled cavities can form within the bonded hem flange, {{which in turn}} can lead to blisters forming in the PVC <b>seam</b> <b>seal.</b> Since the <b>seam</b> <b>seal</b> remains visible, the blisters adversely affect the optical quality of the end product. Besides this, {{there is a risk}} that these defects further develop by mechanical effects during the vehicle lifetime, which would allow direct access of electrolytes into the flange leading to the disruption of the corrosion protection for the bonded hem flange. To avoid the latter, any defect in the <b>seam</b> <b>seal</b> during their manufacture has to be repaired, a step involving time-consuming and cost-intensive finishing work. In order to avoid the costs associated with repairs, more intensive quality control, and potential damage of the manufacturer’s reputation in case severe corrosion issues arise, appropriate measures have to be taken. The research project summarized herein investigates the mechanisms of defect formation; based on the observations it suggests measures to minimize such defects, and ultimately allowing to produce blister-free seam seals. This report describes the results of the FOSTA research project P 909 carried out jointly by Fraunhofer IFAM and Fraunhofer IWU. The objective of this project was to develop the technological basis for the industrial manufacture of blister-free bonded hem flanges. The project involved two complementary approaches: minimization of cavities within the bonded hem flange through process optimization (minimization of the damage potential), and substitution of the defect-prone PVC plastisol by a blister-free seam sealant by means of material optimization and enhancement of the damage tolerance...|$|E

40|$|In {{painting}} processes, highly viscous and non-Newtonian fluids {{are often}} used. An {{example is the}} application of PVC materials for <b>seam</b> <b>sealing</b> over the joined edges to close small openings {{that are difficult to}} shut with other materials. The parameters of the free jet and the material properties are of great importance for the quality of the sealing. The work is focused on the seam formation process with the thin jet spraying using ANSYS-Fluent as a CFD program for numerical simulations. The objective of <b>seam</b> <b>sealing</b> simulations is to develop a model in the most efficient form considering all the relevant application parameters (dose, nozzle design, operating parameters, application geometry) and material properties for process optimization. Regarding the physical process, the flow has a high viscosity and presents a rheological behaviour under given production conditions. These rheological models for the non-Newtonian behaviour of the coating materials are implemented by the so-called "User-Defined functions" and transport equations. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method in ANSYS-Fluent is used, in which a two-phase flow with two immiscible fluids (air and PVC) and their interface are simulated. The boundary phase of both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids (Herschel-Bulkley-law and Thixotropic model) are simulated and compared. Different geometries, in order to represent the automotive bodywork geometry and a round nozzle are generated with the CDF program ANSYS-Workbench. The investigation of the grid sensitivity is studied by the generation of various meshes and refinements with the Adaptation method in ANSYS-Fluent. The results of all these simulations with different parameters and viscosity models are compared with experimental investigations to validate them in order to find the optimized model, which fits to the thin jet spraying in the <b>seam</b> <b>sealing</b> process. Physical phenomena that may occur during the <b>seam</b> <b>sealing</b> process, like the Buckling effect, and the seam ending have been performed...|$|R

40|$|The basic {{physics of}} the <b>seam</b> <b>sealing</b> process in vehicle {{construction}} has been worked out. Thereyby, modeling by computer simulation has played an important role. The rheological behavior of the highly viscous PVC and PUR sealing fluids, e. g., shear thinning, influence of temperature, yield stress, and thixotropy has been studied.

Another area of investigation was concerned with the heating behavior of the flow in hoses, tubes and in the nozzle. From the VOF simulations important information on the application on substrate steps and hem flanges can be obtained.

It is proved experimentally that the sealing robot system used with the developed algorithm is very effective, especially for reducing wasted sealant. ...|$|R

40|$|One form of waterproof, {{breathable}} apparel is manufactured from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane {{laminated fabric}} using a specific process to <b>seal</b> <b>seams</b> {{that have been}} sewn with traditional techniques. The sealing process involves applying waterproof tape to the seam by feeding the seam through two rollers while applying hot air (600 20 C). This study addressed the potential for exposure to particulate matter from this sealing process by characterizing airborne particles in a facility that produces more than 1000 lightweight PTFE rain jackets per day. Aerosol concentrations throughout the facility were mapped, breathing zone concentrations were measured, and hoods used to ventilate the <b>seam</b> <b>sealing</b> operation were evaluated. The geometric mean (GM) particle number concentrations were substantially greater in the sewing and sealing areas (67, 000 and 188, 000 particles cm 2 ? 23)) compared with that measured in the office area (12, 100 particles cm 2 ? 23). Respirable mass concentrations were negligible throughout the facility (GM = 0. 002 mg m 2 ? 23) in the sewing and sealing areas). The particles exiting the final discharge of the facility's ventilation system were dominated by nanoparticles (number median diameter = 25 nm; geometric standard deviation of 1. 39). The breathing zone particle number concentrations of the workers who <b>sealed</b> the sewn <b>seams</b> were highly variable and significantly greater when <b>sealing</b> <b>seams</b> than when conducting other tasks (p < 0. 0001). The sealing workers' breathing zone concentrations ranged from 147, 000 particles cm 2 ? 23 to 798, 000 particles cm 2 ? 23, and their seam responsibility significantly influenced their breathing zone concentrations (p = 0. 03). The finding that particle number concentrations were approximately equal outside the hood and inside the local exhaust duct indicated poor effectiveness of the canopy hoods used to ventilate sealing operations.

40|$|The use of Portable Electronic Devices (PEDs) onboard {{commercial}} airliners {{is considered}} to be desirable for many passengers, However, the possibility of Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) caused by these devices may affect flight safety.

This paper first focuses on IPL measurements for GPS, taken on an out-of-service United Airlines B- 737 - 200.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the simulation of the application of high-viscose PVC-materials, e. g. <b>seam</b> <b>sealing</b> material and adhesive, and the subsequent automated UV radiation for curing. To estimate geometry and position of PVC seams computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are applied. Based on the specific nozzle geometries, {{the flow of the}} PVC material between nozzle and substrate is calculated, including also the formation of the free interface of the jet and the seam on the substrate. Essential preconditions for sensible simulations are the flow rate and the rheology of the material. The simulations that have been performed show a remarkable agreement with experimental investigations, including both, simple flat plates as well as more complex work piece geometries. The second part of the contribution is related to the simulation of the UV radiation process, necessary for curing UV curable materials. Here, a program is available calculating the local light intensity and dose on the substrate. This program includes the dynamic and unsteady motion of one or more UV-lamps. Hence, it is possible to calculate the irradiation on complex 3 -dimensional work pieces with multiple robot based lamps. The accuracy of the program is verified through comparisons with experimental results. Examples of PVC curing will be shown...|$|R
