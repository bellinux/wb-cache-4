40|$|The {{influence}} of microstructure and process history on mechanical behaviour of cast Al-Si alloys is reported. In the present work, the EN-AC 46000 and 46100 aluminium alloys have been gravity cast using a <b>step-bar</b> permanent mould, {{with a range}} of thickness going from 5 to 20 mm. Metallographic and image analysis techniques have been used to quantitatively examine the microstructural parameters of the alpha-Al phase and eutectic Silicon. Microstructure has been also correlated with the results coming from the numerical simulation of the casting process. The results show that SDAS and length of eutectic silicon particles increase with section thickness, and consequently mechanical properties decrease...|$|E
40|$|Porosity {{level and}} local {{solidification}} time are generally acknowledged to affect both dynamic and static properties of cast aluminium alloys intended for structural applications. To analyse these effects, an investigation {{was carried out}} examining permanent mold cast A 319 and A 356 aluminium alloys. <b>Step-bar</b> castings were poured at different temperatures. The castings were sectioned and samples extracted from each step. The porosity level and the secondary dendrite arm spacing were examined using image analysis of randomly selected fields. Results were obtained for steps of thickness 5, 10, 15 and 20 mm. The riser was also sectioned where the thickness was about 35 mm. In every casting considered, porosity level and SDAS increased with section thickness. A computer simulation approach was also carried out to predict SDAS values. The simulation results showed a good correlation to experimental data...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an investigation on mechanical behaviour of cast Al alloys, {{as a function}} of microstructure and processing history. EN-AC 46000 and 46100 alloys have been gravity cast using a <b>step-bar</b> permanent mould. Microstructural investigations have been carried out, leading to the evaluation of various quantitative parameters, such as SDAS or cell size for α-Al phase, average area, length, roundness and aspect ratio for eutectic Si particles, and amount of primary α-Al phase and of eutectic. Results were obtained for steps of thickness 5, 10, 15 and 20 mm. Microstructural parameters have been correlated on one side, with the results coming from the numerical simulation of the casting process (cooling rate, local solidification time) and, on the other, with the mechanical behaviour of the cast alloys (YS, UTS, elongation). In general, porosity level, SDAS and length of eutectic silicon particles increased with section thickness, and consequently mechanical properties decreased...|$|E
