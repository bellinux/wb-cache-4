2500|$|Because of what {{happened}} in Quebec in the winter of 1998, Hydro-Quebec TransEnergie created a De-icing machine to insure that another event like this wouldn't happen again. The De-icer is a [...] machine that runs a high direct current (DC) into a selected transmission line in order to melt the ice on it. However, because the operation in this mode may be very infrequent, when the installation is not being used as a De-icer it is used as a <b>Static</b> <b>Var</b> <b>Compensator,</b> SVC for short, by using the HVDC valves as a Thyristor Controlled Reactor. An innovative design is used, minimizing the power losses of the valves in SVC mode. The reason an AC current wasn't used is because AC current requires a lot of reactive support. It would take a much higher amount of voltage to push the necessary current through the line.The high voltage system in Quebec runs in two transmission corridors, one high voltage system runs in the north-west from the main load centres of Montreal and Quebec and the other runs north-east along the Saint-Lawrence river. It is the latter corridor that is mainly in an area prone to ice storms that deposit ice on the transmission lines.|$|E

In [11], the TCM problem is solved using a qualitative bidding strategy which is achieved through a dynamic game. Rescheduling of generator outputs and transaction curtailments together are employed to manage the congestion that is caused due to bi-lateral and multi-lateral transactions [12]. Similarly, three different frameworks Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS), Lattice Rank- 1 MCS and Lattice Rank- 2 MCS are employed to control the congested line power flows [13].|$|R

50|$|For {{flexible}} {{power transmission}} in the grid, substantial infrastructure upgrades {{must be made}} to the existing power grid. This is primarily being done by upgrading the existing power grid to a system capable of transmitting ultra high voltage AC and ultra high voltage DC power. Over half of China's investment in flexible power transmission {{is in the form of}} <b>static</b> <b>VAR</b> <b>compensators</b> or SVCs. In 2009, SGCC announced its plan to invest approximately 88 billion dollars in ultra high voltage equipment.|$|R
50|$|Generally, static VAR {{compensation}} {{is not done}} at line voltage; a bank of transformers steps the transmission voltage (for example, 230 kV) down to a much lower level (for example, 9.0 kV). This reduces the size and number of components needed in the SVC, although the conductors must be very large to handle the high currents associated with the lower voltage. In some static VAR compensators for industrial applications such as electric arc furnaces, where {{there may be an}} existing medium-voltage busbar present (for example at 33kV or 34.5kV), the <b>static</b> <b>VAR</b> <b>compensator</b> may be directly connected in order to save the cost of the transformer.|$|E
50|$|A <b>static</b> <b>VAR</b> <b>compensator</b> {{can also}} be used for voltage stability. However, a STATCOM has better {{characteristics}} than an SVC. When the system voltage drops sufficiently to force the STATCOM output current to its ceiling, its maximum reactive output current will not be affected by the voltage magnitude. Therefore, it exhibits constant current characteristics when the voltage is low under the limit. In contrast the SVC's reactive output is proportional to the square of the voltage magnitude. This makes the provided reactive power decrease rapidly when voltage decreases, thus reducing its stability. In addition, the speed of response of a STATCOM is faster than that of an SVC and the harmonic emission is lower, however STATCOMs typically exhibit higher losses and may be more expensive than SVCs, so the (older) SVC technology is still widespread.|$|E

25|$|The ‘system gain’ is an {{important}} source of reactive power in the above power balance equation, which is generated by the capacitative nature of the transmission network itself. By making decisive switching actions in the early morning before the demand increases, the system gain can be maximized early on, helping to secure the system for the whole day. To balance the equation some pre-fault reactive generator use will be required.

50|$|Usually a STATCOM is {{installed}} to support electricity networks {{that have a}} poor power factor and often poor voltage regulation. There are however, other uses, the most common use is for voltage stability.A STATCOM is a voltage source converter (VSC)-based device, with the voltage source behind a reactor. The voltage source is created from a DC capacitor and therefore a STATCOM has very little active power capability. However, its active power capability can be increased if a suitable energy storage device is connected across the DC capacitor.The reactive power at the terminals of the STATCOM depends on the amplitude of the voltage source. For example, if the terminal voltage of the VSC {{is higher than the}} AC voltage at the point of connection, the STATCOM generates reactive current; conversely, when the amplitude of the voltage source is lower than the AC voltage, it absorbs reactive power.The response time of a STATCOM is shorter than that of a <b>static</b> <b>VAR</b> <b>compensator</b> (SVC), mainly due to the fast switching times provided by the IGBTs of the voltage source converter. The STATCOM also provides better reactive power support at low AC voltages than an SVC, since the reactive power from a STATCOM decreases linearly with the AC voltage (as the current can be maintained at the rated value even down to low AC voltage).|$|E
