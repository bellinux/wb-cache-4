The findings of this study reveal that the predictions of this work are much accurate than those obtained from the existing empirical correlation (about 10 %). There also exists a good compatibility between the predicted pressure drop values of the present study and the experimental data in both dry and wet state (MSE[*]=[*] 0.0021, MAE[*]=[*] 5 %, and NB[*]=[*]; 0.00232).

40|$|Using lentiviral vector {{products}} in clinical applications requires an accurate method for measuring transduction titer. For vectors lacking a marker gene, quantitative {{polymerase chain reaction}} is {{used to evaluate the}} number of vector DNA copies in transduced target cells, from which a transduction titer is calculated. Immune Design previously described an integration-deficient lentiviral vector pseudotyped with a modified Sindbis virus envelope for use in cancer immunotherapy (VP 02, of the ZVex platform). Standard protocols for titering integration-competent lentiviral vectors employ commercial <b>spin</b> <b>columns</b> to purify vector DNA from transduced cells, but such columns are not optimized for isolation of extrachromosomal (nonintegrated) DNA. Here, we describe a 96 -well transduction titer assay in which DNA extraction is performed in situ in the transduction plate, yielding quantitative recovery of extrachromosomal DNA. Vector titers measured by this method were higher than when commercial <b>spin</b> <b>columns</b> were used for DNA isolation. Evaluation of the method's specificity, linear range, and precision demonstrate that it is suitable for use as a lot release assay to support clinical trials with VP 02. Finally, the method is compatible with titering both integrating and nonintegrating lentiviral vectors, suggesting that it may be used to evaluate the transduction titer for any lentiviral vector...|$|R

The virus, provisionally named parvovirus-like hybrid virus (PHV), is nearly identi-cal by sequence to another DNA virus, NIH-CQV, previously detected in Chinese patients with seronegative (non-A-E) hepatitis. Although we initially detected PHV {{in a wide range}} of clinical samples, with all strains sharing 99 % nucleotide and amino acid identity with each other and with NIH-CQV, the exact origin of the virus was eventually traced to contaminated silica-binding <b>spin</b> <b>columns</b> used for nucleic acid extraction. Definitive confirmation of the origin of PHV, and presumably NIH-CQV, was obtained by in-depth analyses of water eluted through contaminated <b>spin</b> <b>columns.</b> Analysis of environmental metagenome li-braries detected PHV sequences in coastal marine waters of North America, suggesting that a potential association between PHV and diatoms (algae) that generate the silica matrix used in the spin columnsmay have resulted in inadvertent viral contamina-tion during manufacture. The confirmation of PHV/NIH-CQV as laboratory reagent contaminants and not bona fide infectious agents of humans underscores the rigorous approach needed to establish the validity of new viral genomes discovered by next-generation sequencing.
