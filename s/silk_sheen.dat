The same year she commissioned the portrait she drew up her will and named several {{nieces and nephews}} and sums to the poor of both the Mennonite community and the Reformed community. The Rembrandt portrait was left to her brother along with 2000 guilders, and the parrot was {{to be left to}} Giertje Crommelingh.|$|E

25|$|Silk fibers {{from the}} Bombyx mori {{silkworm}} have a triangular cross section with rounded corners, 5–10 μm wide. The fibroin-heavy chain is composed mostly of beta-sheets, {{due to a}} 59-mer amino acid repeat sequence with some variations. The flat surfaces of the fibrils reflect light at many angles, giving <b>silk</b> a natural <b>sheen.</b> The cross-section from other silkworms can vary in shape and diameter: crescent-like for Anaphe and elongated wedge for tussah. Silkworm fibers are naturally extruded from two silkworm glands {{as a pair of}} primary filaments (brin), which are stuck together, with sericin proteins that act like glue, to form a bave. Bave diameters for tussah silk can reach 65 μm. See cited reference for cross-sectional SEM photographs.|$|R

[...] Still by Fitz-James her footing staid; [...] A few faint steps she forward made, [...] Then slow her drooping head she raised, [...] And fearful round the presence gazed; [...] For him she sought who owned this state, [...] The dreaded Prince whose will was fate!-- [...] She gazed on many a princely port [...] Might well have ruled a royal court; [...] On many a splendid garb she gazed,-- [...] Then turned bewildered and amazed, [...] For all stood bare; and in the room [...] Fitz-James alone wore cap and plume. [...] To him each lady's look was lent, [...] On him each courtier's eye was bent; [...] Midst furs and <b>silks</b> and jewels <b>sheen,</b> [...] He stood, in simple Lincoln green, [...] The centre of the glittering ring,-- [...] And Snowdoun's Knight is Scotland's King! ...|$|R
