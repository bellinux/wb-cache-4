500|$|Crewmen aboard Minas Geraes began {{planning}} for a revolt years before 1910, according to João Cândido Felisberto, an experienced sailor who would later become {{the leader of the}} Revolt of the Lash. The conspirators were motivated by the treatment of enlisted men in the Brazilian Navy, extending beyond the lash to even their substandard food, which led to not-uncommon outbreaks of beriberi. Some had formed a committee and had been meeting secretly for years in Rio de Janeiro. This semi-formal organization was only expanded when they were sent to Newcastle in the United Kingdom for training—the operation of such large and complex warships required specific skills. When interviewed years after the mutiny, Felisberto said that they [...] "maintained the committees in the very hotels where we were residing, awaiting the construction of the ships.

2500|$|Although he {{inherited}} several estates, John Cornwall was not left with great wealth. His mother took {{the proceeds of}} well {{over a third of}} the estates while she lived.

Cornwall did not even acquire the advowson of Kinlet church with the lordship: it was held and exercised by the abbot and convent of [...] Wigmore Abbey. The dire <b>situation</b> <b>here</b> was not unusual, as 14th century had been a time of great suffering in the countryside, with a major agrarian crisis in 1315-22 and the onset of the Black Death in 1349. In the worst times, Shropshire inquisitions declared estates worthless or nearly so, and landowners sometimes struggle to meet even modest rents, mainly because it was hard to find tenants or labour in the depopulated countryside, although this placed the survivors in an advantageous bargaining position. Landlords tended to suffer from the falling value of their estates until at least the 1370s but there was then an upturn and the last decades of the century were a time of growing, if modest, prosperity.|$|E

This became part of a [...] "breakthrough exhibition" [...] for him, which had a catalogue, and was titled Altered Egos the Multi-media Artwork of Carl Beam. It was curated by Elizabeth McLuhan. Living in the east end of Peterborough, Ontario, Beam created an early set of large format etchings, consisting of nine prints. There are many signature images in this print collection, which Beam later used to form the image backbone of his iconic work The North American Iceberg. This work was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada, making Beam the first artist of Native ancestry to have his work purchased into the permanent collection of the National Gallery of Canada as contemporary art.|$|E
