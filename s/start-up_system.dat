40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} used {{in various}} monitoring and sensing applications rely on energy harvesting for battery-less operation, as it minimizes {{the need for}} human intervention, and offers long term monitoring solutions. Typical energy harvesters use high efficiency boost converters, which are able to step-up voltages from as low as 10 mV. However, they often need > 200 mV in order to start up initially. Current solutions for achieving a low voltage start up {{require the use of}} bulky off-chip transformers, leading to undesired area overhead. This research work presents proof-of-concept for a fully integrated <b>start-up</b> <b>system,</b> which can cold-start from < 50 mV using on-chip magnetics, and also be used as an energy harvesting charger for ultra low power applications. The use of lossy on-chip transformers in a Meissner Oscillator compared to high-quality off-chip transformers pose new design and optimization challenges. Hence, we have derived intuitive analytical expressions that are well-suited for use with the on-chip magnetics, and used them to co-optimize the oscillator components. An optimized depletion mode MOS transistor was fabricated and tested with an off-chip transformer, to exhibit oscillations from < 3 mV DC input voltage. An optimized on-chip transformer, 36 x smaller in area than the off-chip transformers, is currently awaiting layout and fabrication. A switched capacitor DC-DC circuit has also been designed, which can rectify and boost up the oscillator's output voltage to 1. 2 V, to have a complete <b>start-up</b> <b>system</b> for energy harvesting. by Preetinder Garcha.

40|$|Abstract – The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) is {{currently}} being developed by the South African utility ESKOM, as a new generation nuclear power plant. This so-called high temperature gas-cooled reactor plant {{is based on a}} three-shaft, closed-loop, recuperative, inter-cooled Brayton cycle with Helium as the working fluid. In order to demonstrate the envisaged PBMR control methodologies, a model of the plant was built. The conceptual design of the plant was done with the aid of Flownet, a thermal-fluid simulation software package that has the ability to simulate the steady-state and transient operation of the integrated system.

A proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell {{is one of the}} widely researched fuel cell systems due to its low temperature operation, high power density, fast <b>start-up,</b> <b>system</b> robustness and low emission characteristics. A three-dimensional numerical computation of the effect of design parameters (geometry and flow orientation) and physical parameters (gas diffusion layer porosity) on PEM fuel cell performance was carried out. The continuity, momentum, energy and species conservation equations describing the flow and species transport of the gas mixture in the coupled gas channels and the electrodes were numerically solved using a computational fluid dynamics code. This paper investigated how channel geometries (width and depth), flow orientation and gas diffusion layer (GDL) porosity affect performance and species distribution in a typical fuel cell system. The study also incorporated pressure drop characteristics in the flow channel. The numerical results computed agree well with experimental data in the literature. mp 201...|$|E

40|$|Electron Cyclotron Heating {{has been}} {{proposed}} for plasma initiation, startup assistance and non-inductive startup on NSTX. One physics goal of NSTX will be to establish entirely non-inductive plasma operation by utilizing ECH to provide a sufficient start-up plasma to support further current drive from other heating systems. Scaling of previous ECH-only startup experiments on CDX-U and DIII-D indicate that 400 kW of ECH should be capable of driving 42 kA of pressure driven current on NSTX and possibly higher levels after optimizing the process. Due to the low NSTX magnetic field, over-dense plasmas exist {{during most of the}} discharge so conventional ECH operation is limited to the low density startup phase. To extend the useful operating range for ECH, a scheme involving mode conversion to the electron Bernstein Wave (EBW) from either O r X mode launch is being investigated for bulk heating and current drive applications at higher density. Microwave equipment, including 18 GHz klystrons and 28 GHz gyrotrons are available at ORNL and appear ideal for use on NSTX.

40|$|AIRS was {{launched}} on EOS Aqua in May 2002, together with AMSU-A and HSB (which subsequently failed {{early in the}} mission), to form a next generation polar orbiting infrared and microwave atmospheric sounding system. AIRS/AMSU had two primary objectives. The first objective was to provide real-time data products available {{for use by the}} operational Numerical Weather Prediction Centers in a data assimilation mode to improve the skill of their subsequent forecasts. The second objective was to provide accurate unbiased sounding products with good spatial coverage that are used to generate stable multi-year climate data sets to study the earth's interannual variability, climate processes, and possibly long-term trends. AIRS/AMSU data for all time periods are now being processed using {{the state of the art}} AIRS Science Team Version- 6 retrieval methodology. The Suomi-NPP mission {{was launched}} in October 2011 as part of a sequence of Low Earth Orbiting satellite missions under the "Joint Polar Satellite System" (JPSS). NPP carries CrIS and ATMS, which are advanced infra-red and microwave atmospheric sounders that were designed as follow-ons to the AIRS and AMSU instruments. The main objective of this work is to assess whether CrIS/ATMS will be an adequate replacement for AIRS/AMSU from the perspective of the generation of accurate and consistent long term climate data records, or if improved instruments should be developed for future flight. It is critical for CrIS/ATMS to be processed using an algorithm similar to, or at least comparable to, AIRS Version- 6 before such an assessment can be made. We have been conducting research to optimize products derived from CrIS/ATMS observations using a scientific approach analogous to the AIRS Version- 6 retrieval algorithm. Our latest research uses Version- 5. 70 of the CrIS/ATMS retrieval algorithm, which is otherwise analogous to AIRS Version- 6, but does not yet contain the benefit of use of a Neural-Net first guess <b>start-up</b> <b>system</b> which significantly improved results of AIRS Version- 6. Version- 5. 70 CrIS/ATMS temperature profile and surface skin temperature retrievals are of very good quality, and are better than AIRS Version- 5 retrievals, but are still significantly poorer than those of AIRS Version- 6. CrIS/ATMS retrievals should improve when a Neural-Net <b>start-up</b> <b>system</b> is ready for use. We also examined CrIS/ATMS retrievals generated by NOAA using their NUCAPS retrieval algorithm, which is based on earlier versions of the AIRS Science Team retrieval algorithms.

30|$|Recently, {{there have}} been {{numerous}} investigations on fuel cells, including DMFC, proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), and so on, which are popular fuel cell technologies. As a novel energy source, DMFCs can be used for mobile and stationary applications [9, 10]. Many research advances have been achieved in the fuel cell field. Among the fuel cells, DMFCs have been extensively studied in recent years [11 – 16] because of their many advantages, such as high power density, ease of fuel handling, ease of charging, and low environmental impact [17, 18]. However, several technical challenges for the commercialization of DMFCs remain unresolved, including methanol crossover, low chemical reaction rates, and catalyst poisoning. However, DMFCs still have received attention from many researchers and have become the most popular fuel cells because of their low-temperature operation (DMFC systems operate at 373  K). Due to DMFC’s advantages of high energy efficiency and rapid <b>start-up</b> <b>system,</b> DMFC technology is very suitable to be applied as residential power sources, batteries in mobile devices, and as vehicle fuel [19 – 22].

40|$|The {{wind power}} {{research}} at the division of Electricity at Uppsala University is aimed towards increased understanding of vertical axis wind turbines. The considered type of wind turbine is an H-rotor with a directly driven synchronous generator operating at variable speed. The experimental work presented in this thesis comprises investigation of three vertical axis wind turbines of different design and size. The electrical, control and measurement systems for the first 12 kW wind turbine have been designed and implemented. The second was a 10 kW wind turbine adapted to a telecom application. Both the 12 kW and the 10 kW were operated against dump loads. The third turbine was a 200 kW grid-connected wind turbine, where control and measurement systems have been implemented. Experimental results have shown that an all-electric control, substituting mechanical systems such as blade-pitch, is possible {{for this type of}} turbine. By controlling the rectified generator voltage, the rotational speed of the turbine is also controlled. An electrical <b>start-up</b> <b>system</b> has been built and verified. The power coefficient has been measured and the stall behaviour of this type of turbine has been examined. An optimum tip speed ratio control has been implemented and tested, with promising results. Use of the turbine to estimate the wind speed has been demonstrated. This has been used to get a faster regulation of the turbine compared to if an anemometer had been used. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the heat {{transfer}} processes between an over-bed burner flame and a fluidized bed during start-up as been conducted. Owing {{to the difficulty of}} estimating the flame to bed convection coefficient in an industrial boiler, convection coefficients were determined using a laboratory bench scale unit. Such convection heat transfer coefficients are obtained for 3 Â kg, 4 Â kg and 5. 5 Â kg initial bed inventories by combining measured temperatures and flow rates with a mathematical model representing the complex energy exchange in the system. Results show that the height of the fluidized bed and its distance to the flame are an important factor in the overall heat transfer process, both by convection and radiation. For 5. 5 Â kg, 4 Â kg and 3 Â kg initial bed inventories, the convection coefficients obtained, at the end of start-up, are 180 Â Â±Â  30 Â W/m 2 Â K, 150 Â Â±Â  20 Â W/m 2 Â K and 95 Â Â±Â  10 Â W/m 2 Â K respectively.

40|$|AbstractIndustrial {{projects}} are growing {{bigger and more}} complex, producing new challenges for their completion. As such, project management, {{and the perception of}} project success, must be aligned with a new paradigm: the plant's completion is not enough. It is necessary to deliver the benefits envisaged during the project formulation, including successful commercial operation. This new paradigm requires new processes and behaviors related not only to engineering best practices but also to new managerial approaches. Closure is pivotal throughout the life cycle when the facility transitions from plant completion to start-up, followed by the ramping up of operations. To deliver what was previously planned, three main drivers must be in place: quality of the scope definition; alignment of the business strategy; and operability of the asset delivered. Traditionally, commissioning has been considered an activity that is executed just before the operations take over from the <b>start-up</b> <b>systems.</b> Increasingly, it has become a comprehensive and systematic process to verify and document the systems of a new or remodeled plant functioning as designed to meet the owner's requirements.
