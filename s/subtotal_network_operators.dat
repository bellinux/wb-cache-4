40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the issue of how the {{possibility}} for areements among <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> about building joint facilities affects their networks qualities, their profits and social welfare. We show that allowing the <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> to build joint facilities can make the <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> to increase their network qualities when they decide so simultaneously. When we analyze entry, only the incumbent increases his network quality. The main result is that <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> and the regulator coincide in thier decisions about how much the <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> should build jointly when the <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> decide simultaneously their network qualities. The same result arises when we analyze entry and the <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> are sufficiently differentiated. But, if there is entry and the <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> are not sufficiently differentiated, a regulator is hended to force the <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> to build joint facilities, what is very surprising from the current National Regulatory point of vie w. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Network {{virtualization}} {{is one of}} the {{key concepts}} of the Future Internet. However, the use of virtualization techniques in wireless mesh networks has thus far not been adequately studied. In this paper we describe VIMENO: a Virtual wireless Mesh <b>Network</b> architecture for <b>Operators,</b> i. e., the first virtualization-enabled wireless mesh network architecture designed for operators. In the proposed architecture, virtualization is used to divide the mesh resources governed by a single mesh <b>network</b> <b>operator</b> among multiple virtual <b>network</b> <b>operators.</b> The advantage of this outsourcing approach is that each virtual <b>network</b> <b>operator</b> can focus on providing a service to its end-users, leaving the network administration to the mesh <b>network</b> <b>operator.</b> This leads to the lowering of the operating expenditure of virtual <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> and allows tailoring of each virtual <b>network</b> to individual <b>operator</b> and service requirements. ...|$|R

40|$|Mobile phones {{have not}} only changed the way people communicate, but have also become an {{important}} tool for financial services. The question arises whether these financial services should be provided by a mobile <b>network</b> <b>operator</b> or not. Therefore {{the goal of this}} paper is to analyse the opportunities and threats for mobile <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> to provide financial services. The paper concludes that one of the major decision factors is the regulatory framework. If mobile <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> have to establish a bank in order to provide financial services then many advantages and synergies that could be derived from the core competences of the <b>network</b> <b>operator</b> will be lost. Synergies can be used if the mobile <b>network</b> <b>operator</b> can receive a licence as financial service provider, but not as a bank. However, if this is not possible it would be better for mobile <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> to partner with existing banks or similar institutions in order to use existing competitive advantages in the best way...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies Cournot {{competition}} with two generators who share one transmission {{line with a}} limited capacity to supply price-taking consumers. In such a game the <b>network</b> <b>operator</b> needs a rule to allocate transmission capacity. Three rules are studied: all-or-nothing, proportional, and efficient rationing. The first result {{is that if the}} <b>network</b> <b>operator</b> taxes the whole congestion rent, the generators strategically change their production quantities, such that the <b>network</b> <b>operator</b> obtains no congestion rent. This gives poor incentives for investment in transmission capacity. The second result is that the <b>network</b> <b>operator</b> can create competition among the generators, which can increase welfare. Marginal nodal congestion pricing, which is optimal under perfect competition, is sub-optimal when generators can set their production quantities freely. It does not generate revenue for the <b>network</b> <b>operator,</b> nor does it increase competition among the generators. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{issue in the}} network neutrality debate {{is the extent to}} which <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> should be allowed to discriminate among Internet packet streams to selectively block, adjust quality of service, or adjust prices. This paper first reviews technology now available for traffic discrimination. It then shows how <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> can use this technology in ways that would make the Internet less valuable to Internet users, and why a <b>network</b> <b>operator</b> would have financial incentive to do this if and only if it has sufficient market power. A particular concern is that <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> could use discrimination to extract oligopoly rents from upstream markets that are highly competitive. This paper also shows how <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> can use the very same technology to discriminate in ways that benefit Internet users, as well as the <b>network</b> <b>operator.</b> Thus, <b>network</b> neutrality supporters are right to fear unlimited discrimination in some cases, while network neutrality opponents are right to fear a policy that imposes strict limits on discrimination. From this, we argue that the network neutrality debate should be refocused on the search for a balanced policy, which is a policy that limits the more harmful discriminatory practices in markets where there is insufficient competition, with little interference to beneficia...|$|R
40|$|The Digital Marketplace is a market-based {{framework}} where <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> offer {{communications services}} with {{competition at the}} call level. It strives to address a tussle between the actors involved in a heterogeneous wireless access network. However, as with any market-like institution, {{it is vital to}} analyze the Digital Marketplace from the strategic perspective to ensure that all shortcomings are removed prior to implementation. In this paper, we analyze the selling mechanism proposed in the Digital Marketplace. The mechanism is based on a procurement ﬁrst-price sealed-bid auction where the <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> represent the sellers/bidders, and the end-user of a wireless service is the buyer. However, this auction format is somewhat unusual as the winning bid is a composition of both the <b>network</b> <b>operator’s</b> monetary bid and their reputation rating. We create a simple economic model of the auction, and we show that it is mathematically intractable to derive the equilibrium bidding behavior when there are N <b>network</b> <b>operators,</b> and we make only generic assumptions about the structure of the bidding strategies. We then move on to consider a scenario with only two <b>network</b> <b>operators,</b> and assume that <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> use bidding strategies which are linear functions of their costs. This results in the derivation of the equilibrium bidding behavior in that scenario...|$|R
