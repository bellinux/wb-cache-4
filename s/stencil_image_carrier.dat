Domain wavelet transform used in the visible watermark does not provide security for watermark. Visible watermark methods do not provide safety for both watermark and <b>carrier</b> <b>image.</b> To overcome that, lossless watermarking using histogram shifting algorithm is proposed. The <b>carrier</b> <b>image</b> carries watermark. The <b>carrier</b> <b>image</b> can be stored lossless after the extraction of watermark from it. Histogram Shifting algorithm is used to embed watermark logo in the <b>carrier</b> <b>image.</b> By using the Rijndael algorithm, the error is spread to the entire image.

40|$|Abstract — We {{describe}} an effective method for image encryption which employs magnitude and phase manipulation using <b>carrier</b> <b>images.</b> Although it involves traditional methods like magnitude and phase encryptions, {{the novelty of}} this work lies in deploying the concept of <b>carrier</b> <b>images</b> for encryption purpose. To this end, a <b>carrier</b> <b>image</b> is randomly chosen from a set of stored images. One dimensional (1 -D) discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is then carried out on the original image to be encrypted along with the <b>carrier</b> <b>image.</b> Row wise spectral addition and scaling is performed between the magnitude spectra of the original and <b>carrier</b> <b>images</b> by randomly selecting the rows. Similarly, row wise phase addition and scaling is performed between the original and <b>carrier</b> <b>images</b> phase spectra by randomly selecting the rows. The encrypted image obtained by these two operations is further subjected to one more level of magnitude and phase manipulation using another randomly chosen <b>carrier</b> <b>image</b> by 1 -D DFT along the columns. The resulting encrypted image {{is found to be}} fully distorted, resulting in increasing the robustness of the proposed work.

40|$|Abstract—A secure {{communication}} scheme for true color image was proposed. It {{is aimed at}} the hiding problem of {{a huge amount of}} true-color image data in the covert communication and maintaining the good visual quality of <b>carrier</b> <b>image.</b> Secure communication is achieved by combining encryption and hiding. Encryption on secret image is performed in the spatial domain of <b>carrier</b> <b>image.</b> Instead of changing pixel physics position or gray value, encryption method is searching the index value of secret image and hiding it in <b>carrier</b> <b>image.</b> <b>Carrier</b> <b>image</b> is designed as a palette, and the use of chaotic signal to act on the <b>carrier</b> <b>image</b> makes palette colors rich and evenly distributed. Each pixel of secret image is adaptively mapped to a subscript in palette by the minimum principle of Euclidean distance. Secret image is compressed and encoded as a data stream during encryption, reducing the amount of data to be hidden. Secret image is hidden in the wavelet domain of <b>carrier</b> <b>image</b> by using the lifting wavelet transform and multi-channel spread-spectrum embedded way. Simulation experiments show that this {{secure communication}} scheme reduces hidden data amount and improves information hiding transparency to ensure the concealment and safety of communication.

40|$|After {{a lengthy}} general absence of imagery, figural {{representations}} appeared once {{again during the}} Final Bronze Age and Early Iron Age (11 th 8 th century) in many regions of Europe. Depictions from this time, found in two major regions of France and Italy, are analysed here in example and presented in a systematic compilation for the first time. By means of contrasting comparison and examination {{at different levels of}} semiotic iconographic analysis  motifs, syntax, choice of <b>image</b> <b>carrier</b> and its social context  the development and the mechanisms of diverse visual systems of communication can be identified and followed. As simple as the individual iconographic signs themselves may appear, their repetitive use, the intentional choice of particular motifs and the <b>image</b> <b>carriers</b> as well as the adherence to strict rules in syntax show that the representations are artistic expressions with which messages were conveyed. According to the respective carrier of decoration, syntactical order as well as archaeological context, these systems of signs could have functioned as mnemonic devices for reconstructing a complex situation, such as a myth, or they could have also designated social affiliation or status. Figural representations are an aspect of the complex interactions between prehistoric societies. They are evidence of the complicated and dynamic sign systems that were purposefully employed in order to visually communicate and substantiate ideal values and social norms. Whereas in the area of France clay vessels were utilised almost exclusively as <b>image</b> <b>carriers,</b> in Italy not only vessels but other objects such as tools, weapons and elements of dress carry figural decorations as well. The development of different sign systems can be noted, which in many cases are connected with special <b>image</b> <b>carriers</b> and thus stand within a specific social context. The beginnings of figural art may not be described as a uniform process. Quite the opposite, diverse courses in development can be recognised in various geographic areas and in the variety of decorated objects and themes in imagery. Not a single pictorial theme progresses straight-lined from the detailed to the abstract or reduced image. In both geographic areas figural representations developed at a time, during which society had became more complex. Apparently changes in communal ties led to needs and forms of social organisation that demanded, among others, new kinds of visual communication. As of the 11 th century in Italy a dynamic system can be noted, as seen in numerous changes at different levels (repertory of motifs, choice of <b>image</b> <b>carrier,</b> signs used) as well as regional shifts (for example in the Villanova culture). The system culminated in early Etruscan art with new impulses from the eastern Mediterranean in the 8 th century. In France, by contrast, a brief yet intense floruit of figural representations occurred in the 9 th century. But unlike Italy, a driving (exterior) force during the 8 th century was absent, which might have stimulated a progressive development in figural decoration...|$|R
