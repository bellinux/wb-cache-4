5|$|The 1987 White Paper {{was seen}} by many as an attempt to {{strengthen}} Australia's relationship with the United States, which had been damaged by New Zealand's stance against nuclear weapons in its ports. In line with this policy, the RAN was <b>structured</b> <b>to</b> become more self-reliant and its activities during the late 1980s were focused on operating within Australia's local region.|$|E
5|$|The NBA Finals was {{initially}} <b>structured</b> <b>to</b> harbor a 2–3–2 format until 2013, {{where the first}} two and last two games of the series were played at the arena of the team who earned home-court advantage by having the better record during the regular season. This was then altered, because teams with the home-court advantage went 21–8 in all Finals appearances. The competition is currently structured under a 2–2–1–1–1 format, where {{the first two games}} are played at home for the higher-seeded team, and the following two at the home of the lower-seeded team. The following three are played at each team's home arena respectively.|$|E
5|$|Classic Maya social {{organization}} {{was based on}} the ritual authority of the ruler, rather than central control of trade and food distribution. This model of rulership was poorly <b>structured</b> <b>to</b> respond to changes, because the ruler's actions were limited by tradition to such activities as construction, ritual, and warfare. This only served to exacerbate systemic problems. By the 9th and 10th centuries, this resulted in collapse of this system of rulership. In the northern Yucatán, individual rule was replaced by a ruling council formed from elite lineages. In the southern Yucatán and central Petén, kingdoms declined; in western Petén and some other areas, the changes were catastrophic and resulted in the rapid depopulation of cities. Within a couple of generations, large swathes of the central Maya area were all but abandoned. Both the capitals and their secondary centres were generally abandoned within a period of 50 to 100 years. One by one, cities stopped sculpting dated monuments; the last Long Count date was inscribed at Toniná in 909. Stelae were no longer raised, and squatters moved into abandoned royal palaces. Mesoamerican trade routes shifted and bypassed Petén.|$|E

5|$|On January 2, 2014, the Phillies and Comcast Sportsnet {{announced}} a 25-year, $2.5billion TV contract; although it averaged $100million a year, it was <b>structured</b> <b>to</b> begin below the average and end above it. Soon after {{the agreement was}} reached, Comcast (who would hire announcers under the deal) removed 37-year announcer Chris Wheeler and seven-year announcer Gary Matthews. Although the remaining Phillies announcers were disappointed with the decision, they all returned for the season. One replacement analyst was planned, and early candidates included Ricky Bottalico, Mitch Williams, John Kruk, Chris Coste, Jamie Moyer, Brad Lidge and Matt Stairs. Lidge and Kruk {{were among the first}} to be contacted, but both declined. Mickey Morandini was a possibility, but Stairs and Moyer reportedly interviewed well and were favored. On February 11, Comcast announced that Moyer and Stairs would join Tom McCarthy and Gregg Murphy on the Phillies' TV broadcast team. The company later announced that Moyer and Stairs would each call over 100 games, including 30 games together with McCarthy. After the first spring-training game, it was announced that Mike Schmidt would join the broadcast team for Sunday afternoon games.|$|E

The education focuses much more strongly on academic subjects, though students normally continue to take courses in art, music, and crafts.

25|$|The key {{challenge}} of the global commons is the design of governance structures and management systems capable of addressing the complexity of multiple public and private interests, subject to often unpredictable changes, ranging from the local to the global level. As with global public goods, management of the global commons requires pluralistic legal entities, usually international and supranational, public and private, <b>structured</b> <b>to</b> match {{the diversity of interests}} and the type of resource to be managed, and stringent enough with adequate incentives to ensure compliance. Such management systems are necessary to avoid, at the global level, the classic tragedy of the commons, in which common resources become overexploited.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that the Maya population exceeded the carrying capacity of the environment, resulting in depleted agricultural resources, deforestation, and overhunting of megafauna. A 200-year long drought appears to have occurred around the same time. Classic Maya social organisation was based upon the ritual authority of the ruler, rather than central control of trade and food distribution. This model of rulership was poorly <b>structured</b> <b>to</b> respond to changes, with the ruler's freedom of action being limited to traditional responses. The rulers reacted in their culturally-bound manner, by intensifying such activities as construction, ritual, and warfare. This was counterproductive and only served to exacerbate systemic problems.|$|E

Marine electronics including thermal cameras under both the FLIR and Raymarine brands fall under the Maritime segment. Thermal and visible light cameras for industrial, commercial, and residential security are serviced under the Lorex by FLIR brands by the Security segment. The Detection segment produces sensors for chemical, biological, radiation, and explosive detection.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} some overlap between {{biological}} psychiatry and neurology, the latter generally focuses on disorders where gross or visible pathology {{of the nervous system}} is apparent, such as epilepsy, cerebral palsy, encephalitis, neuritis, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. There is some overlap with neuropsychiatry, which typically deals with behavioral disturbances in the context of apparent brain disorder. In contrast biological psychiatry describes the basic principles and then delves deeper into various disorders. It is <b>structured</b> <b>to</b> follow the organisation of the DSM-IV, psychiatry's primary diagnostic and classification guide. The contributions of this field explore functional neuroanatomy, imaging and neuropsychology and pharmacotherapeutic possibilities for depression, anxiety and mood disorders, substance abuse and eating disorders, schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, and cognitive and personality disorders.|$|E
25|$|Sir Thomas More has {{an unusually}} high total of 59 {{speaking}} parts, including 22 in the first 500 lines of the play; this, plus crowd scenes, would have taxed the ability of any playing company of the time to stage it. The job could only be managed through complex doubling and more-than-doubling of roles by the actors. Out of necessity, the play is <b>structured</b> <b>to</b> allow for this multiple doubling of roles: it is set up in three phases—More's rise; More's Chancellorship; More's fall—with very limited overlap between the thirds. Only three characters, More himself and the Earls of Shrewsbury and Surrey, appear in all three portions; six other characters—Lady More, Palmer, Roper, Sergeant Downes, the Lord Mayor, and a sheriff—appear {{in two of the}} three segments.|$|E
