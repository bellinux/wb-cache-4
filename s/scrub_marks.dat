40|$|Wafer probing is {{the state}} of-the-art {{procedure}} to test the electrical functionality of devices in semiconductor manufacturing and packaging process. During measurement, a probe tip is pressed onto the metal pad of the device with a defined force thus achieving a low-resistive and stable electrical contact. However, the contact forces have to be kept below a critical limit to avoid chip damage and to reduce the remaining <b>scrub</b> <b>mark.</b> This becomes particularly important for probing highly integrated devices with their increasingly reduced pad sizes and pitches, to maintain the wire bonding capability of the pads after testing, and when probing over active areas. It is thus important to analyze the amount of plastic deformation in the pad metal and the risk for crack initiation and chip damage during the probing process. In this study, the deformations transferred to the pad metal and the underlying active areas through probing were analyzed by finite element (FE) simulati on. For this purpose, two different bond pad metals were experimentally investigated by mechanical testing for a given probe tip geometry and displacement. In a second step reproducible scratches on bond pads were created using modified nanoindentation scratch experiments. The achieved force-displacement behavior was modeled taking into consideration the plastic material properties and large deformations during testing...|$|R
5000|$|On 1 January 1957 he was {{appointed}} Chief Constable of Leicester. There he instituted many reforms, especially regarding Leicester's traffic problems, including appointing the city's first traffic wardens. He acquired the nickname [...] "Lone Ranger of Leicester". Following the 1966 escape of the spy George Blake from Wormwood <b>Scrubs,</b> <b>Mark</b> {{was appointed}} to the Mountbatten inquiry into prison security. Here he attracted the attention of Chancellor of the Exchequer Roy Jenkins, and in February 1967 was appointed Assistant Commissioner [...] "D" [...] (Personnel and Training) of the Metropolitan Police, where his welcome was less than ecstatic from a force that did not like outsiders; {{at the end of his}} first week, he was encouraged by Commissioner Sir Joseph Simpson to apply for the post of Chief Constable of Lancashire. The following year he was briefly appointed Assistant Commissioner [...] "B" [...] (Traffic). However, in March 1968, Simpson died in office. Peter Brodie, Assistant Commissioner [...] "C" [...] (Crime), was widely tipped to succeed him, but Home Secretary James Callaghan saw the opportunity to impose government will on the force and offered the job to Mark. Mark, realising that an outsider would not be accepted at this time, suggested the appointment of Deputy Commissioner Sir John Waldron, with himself succeeding Waldron as Deputy Commissioner.|$|R
500|$|Capybaras {{have two}} types of scent glands; a morillo (...) , located on the snout, and anal glands. Both sexes have these glands, but males have much larger morillos and use their anal glands more frequently. The anal glands of males are also lined with {{detachable}} hairs. A crystalline form of scent secretion is coated on these hairs and is released when in contact with objects such as plants. These hairs have a longer-lasting scent mark and are tasted by other capybaras. Capybaras scent-mark by rubbing their morillos on objects, or by walking over <b>scrub</b> and <b>marking</b> it with their anal glands. Capybaras can spread their scent further by urinating; however, females usually mark without urinating and scent-mark less frequently than males overall. Females mark more often during the wet season {{when they are in}} estrus. In addition to objects, males also scent-mark females.|$|R

40|$|Acacia whibleyana (Whibley wattle) is {{a nationally}} {{endangered}} wattle, endemic to the near-coastal region around Tumby Bay on the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. Two distinct sub-populations, {{referred to as}} the Quarry and the Salt-lake populations, each contained plants growing on roadsides and in <b>scrub</b> fragments. <b>Marked</b> differences were observed in the population size structure between the two populations. The absence of juveniles on roadsides in both populations signaled potential limitations to natural recruitment. Studies of reproductive biology of scrub plants over two years (1996 - 1997) indicated that between 1. 1 % (Salt-lake) and 6. 9 % (Quarry) of A. whibleyana inflorescences produced fruit. Each infructescence produced an average of 1. 2 – 1. 8 pods, although up to 10 pods per infructescence were observed at the Quarry scrub in 1996. Each pod contained 4 – 6 seed on average, with a viability of 85 %. Plants at the Salt-lake scrub generally set less fruit, produced fewer pods per infructescence, and had lower seed numbers per pod when compared with Quarry plants, differences attributable to the superior vigor of Quarry plants. A. whibleyana seeds were dispersed by ants attracted by the lipid-rich aril. The soil seed bank had a patchy distribution across both sites possibly due to seed concentrating in the vicinity of ant nests. We concluded that the reproductive attributes studied were unlikely to constrain natural recruitment of A. whibleyana as both populations were capable of producing viable seed over the two years of this study.

40|$|The fossorial Florida Sand Skink (Plestiodon [=Neoseps] reynoldsi) inhabits a {{restricted}} range of scrub and sandhill fragments on the ridges of central Florida. The {{high rate of}} urban and agricultural development in this area necessitates conservation strategies other than land acquisition and management because of the limited remaining Florida Sand Skink habitat available. This study tests the viability of translocation as a conservation strategy for this species and assesses which features of a recipient site contribute to the successful establishment of a population. In 2007, 300 individuals were collected and moved from an intact <b>scrub</b> habitat, individually <b>marked,</b> {{and moved to a}} nearby reclaimed site with no existing Florida Sand Skink population. Fifteen 20 m² enclosures were constructed at the recipient site, and 20 skinks were randomly assigned to each. These enclosures were divided among five treatments, which were represented the range of habitat types at the donor site and differed in {{the presence or absence of}} a shade-providing object and coarse woody debris. Translocated skinks were monitored for two years to measure survival and reproduction. While survival and reproduction were apparent in all treatments, survival was significantly greater in enclosures with no shade-providing object and low soil moisture, and reproduction was most evident in enclosures with less light intensity and soil compaction. Common measurement of environmental variables at the donor and recipient sites showed that all of the recipient site enclosures differed from the donor site in the amount of vegetative cover but contained the structural heterogeneity that is associated with Florida Sand Skink presence in the wild. This study indicates that translocation is a practical conservation strategy for this species, and my results can be used to inform protocol for future Florida Sand Skink translocation efforts...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 66 - 77) Aim: Island ecosystems worldwide {{have been}} heavily {{impacted by the}} introduction of exotic plant and animal species. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess changes in cover, richness, and diversity of native and non-native plant species following the removal of feral herbivores from San Clemente Island, California. Location: San Clemente Island, California, USA. Methods: Fourteen transects, six located in coastal sage scrub and eight in grassland vegetation, were sampled in 1986, 1988, 1990, 1992, and 2011 for ground cover for all vascular plants intercepted along each transect. Due to the inherent differences in structure and composition of coastal sage scrub and grassland vegetation types, data from the two communities were analyzed separately in the study. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess statistically significant differences in mean cover of growth forms (i. e., subshrubs, herbs, and vines) and individual species, percent similarity, richness, and diversity between sample periods. Additionally, mean cover over time by growth forms was differentiated by native and non-native species. I used a t-test to determine significant differences between mean native and non-native cover, species richness, and diversity within each sample year. Regression analysis was used to determine the statistical relationship between herbaceous cover and annual precipitation. Results: Mean vegetation cover of both communities varied over the course of the study period. Cover on grassland sites was increasingly dominated over time by non-native annual grasses. However, this trend was complicated by individual species' responses to variation in annual amounts of precipitation. Mean species richness and diversity values did not differ significantly over the study period. Sites of coastal sage scrub experienced a significant increase in ground cover of native subshrubs and herbs. Some non-native herbs that were common from 1986 through 1992 were non-existent on transects in 2011 while Bromus madritensis ssp. rubens, a non-native annual grass, showed a dramatic cover increase. Ground cover and compositional trends of herbs on sage scrub sites also corresponded strongly to amounts of annual precipitation. Main Conclusions: Study results indicate that non-native herbaceous cover increased at the expense of native herb cover on grassland sites following the release from grazing pressure. However, not all of the changes can be ascribed to the removal of the feral herbivores as annual precipitation amounts also influence amount of herbaceous cover of both native and non-native herbs. The sites of coastal sage <b>scrub</b> showed a <b>marked</b> increase in subshrub cover over the course of the study. Artemisia nesiotica, a native subshrub once thought to be a co-dominant on the island, has been observed over the study's course spreading from protected canyon sides into grassland areas on the island's southern half...|$|R
