5|$|The least weasel mates in April–July {{and there}} is a 34- to 37-day {{gestation}} period. In the Northern Hemisphere, the average litter size consists of 6 kits and these reach sexual maturity in 3 to 4 months. Males may mate during their first year of life, though this is usually unsuccessful. They are fecund in February–October, though the early stages of <b>spermatogenesis</b> do occur throughout the winter months. Anestrus in females lasts from September until February.|$|E
5|$|The length time {{in which}} {{offspring}} stay with their mother varies, though it can last until the female's next calving. Likewise, calves may suckle for only a month or {{as long as a}} year. Females become sexually mature when they are four years old, while males become mature at four or five years. <b>Spermatogenesis</b> in male giraffes begins at three to four years of age. Males must wait until they are at least seven years old to gain the opportunity to mate.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old. Females enter oestrus (typically five days long) from January to March. In males, <b>spermatogenesis</b> occurs mainly in February and March. In {{southern}} Turkmenistan, mating occurs from January to early February. The mating season is marked by noisy fights among males for dominance. Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by {{the nape of her neck}} and mounts her. Vocalisations and flehmen are prominent during courtship. After a successful copulation, the female gives out a loud cry and reacts with aversion towards her partner. The pair then separate.|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{control of}} <b>spermatogenesis</b> varies among species. In humans the {{mechanism}} {{is not completely}} understood; however {{it is known that}} initiation of <b>spermatogenesis</b> occurs at puberty due to the interaction of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and Leydig cells. If the pituitary gland is removed, <b>spermatogenesis</b> can still be initiated by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone. In contrast to FSH, LH appears to have little role in <b>spermatogenesis</b> outside of inducing gonadal testosterone production.|$|E
25|$|The Sertoli cells {{themselves}} mediate {{parts of}} <b>spermatogenesis</b> through hormone production. They {{are capable of}} producing the hormones estradiol and inhibin. The Leydig cells are also capable of producing estradiol {{in addition to their}} main product testosterone. Estrogen {{has been found to be}} essential for <b>spermatogenesis</b> in animals. However, a man with estrogen insensitivity syndrome (a defective ERα) was found produce sperm with a normal sperm count, albeit abnormally low sperm viability; whether he was sterile or not is unclear. Levels of estrogen that are too high can be detrimental to <b>spermatogenesis</b> due to suppression of gonadotropin secretion and by extension intratesticular testosterone production. Prolactin also appears to be important for <b>spermatogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Spermatogenesis</b> is {{enhanced}} at temperatures {{slightly less than}} core body temperature. The <b>spermatogenesis</b> is less efficient at lower and higher temperatures than 33°C. This is presumably why the testes are located outside the body. There {{are a number of}} mechanisms to maintain the testes at the optimum temperature.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spermatogenesis</b> {{continues}} after birth. In the 3rd to 5th months of life, {{some of the}} fetal spermatogonia residing along the basement membrane become type A spermatogonia. More gradually, other fetal spermatogonia become type B spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes by the 5th year after birth. <b>Spermatogenesis</b> arrests at this stage until puberty.|$|E
25|$|The testes grow in {{response}} to the start of <b>spermatogenesis.</b> Size depends on lytic function, sperm production (amount of <b>spermatogenesis</b> present in testis), interstitial fluid, and Sertoli cell fluid production. After puberty, the volume of the testes can be increased by over 500% as compared to the pre-pubertal size. Testicles are fully descended before one reaches puberty.|$|E
25|$|Dietary {{deficiencies}} (such as vitamins B, E and A), anabolic steroids, metals (cadmium and lead), x-ray exposure, dioxin, alcohol, {{and infectious}} diseases will also adversely affect the rate of <b>spermatogenesis.</b> In addition, the male germ line is susceptible to DNA damage caused by oxidative stress, and this damage likely has {{a significant impact on}} fertilization and pregnancy. Exposure to pesticides also affects <b>spermatogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In all cases, {{the loss}} in testes volume {{corresponds}} {{with a loss}} of <b>spermatogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|FSH stimulates {{both the}} {{production}} of androgen binding protein (ABP) by Sertoli cells, {{and the formation of}} the blood-testis barrier. ABP is essential to concentrating testosterone in levels high enough to initiate and maintain <b>spermatogenesis.</b> Intratesticular testosterone levels are 20–100 or 50–200 times higher than the concentration found in blood, although there is variation over a 5- to 10-fold range amongst healthy men. FSH may initiate the sequestering of testosterone in the testes, but once developed only testosterone is required to maintain <b>spermatogenesis.</b> However, increasing the levels of FSH will increase {{the production of}} spermatozoa by preventing the apoptosis of type A spermatogonia. The hormone inhibin acts to decrease the levels of FSH. Studies from rodent models suggest that gonadotropins (both LH and FSH) support the process of <b>spermatogenesis</b> by suppressing the proapoptotic signals and therefore promote spermatogenic cell survival.|$|E
25|$|If the {{underlying}} infertility {{is related to}} abnormalities in <b>spermatogenesis,</b> it is plausible, but too early to examine that male offspring are at higher risk for sperm abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|CAH {{has little}} effect on male {{fertility}} unless an adult stops taking his glucocorticoid medication entirely for an extended time, in which case excessive adrenal testosterone may reduce testicular production as well as <b>spermatogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Description: This {{paper is}} written in support of Moore and Robinson’s {{previous}} interpretation that, {{in regards to the}} <b>spermatogenesis</b> of Periplanata americana, the nucleolus of the first spermatocyte is the homologue of one or two spermatogonial chromosomes. They attribute the elongate form to mechanical influences and believe it to usually have a spherical shape like the nucleolus. In place of Periplanata americana, Foot and Strobell studied the <b>spermatogenesis</b> of Anasa tristis. The original paper asserts that Anasa tristis has 22 chromosomes, but they confirmed Paulmier and Montgomery’s assessment that Anasa tristis has 21 chromosomes after the paper was sent to press.|$|E
25|$|Leydig cells – cells {{localized}} between {{seminiferous tubules}} that produce and secrete testosterone and other androgens important for sexual development and puberty, {{secondary sexual characteristics}} like facial hair, sexual behavior and libido, supporting <b>spermatogenesis</b> and erectile function. Testosterone also controls testicular volume.|$|E
25|$|Spermatozoa are {{produced}} in the seminiferous tubules of the testes in a process called <b>spermatogenesis.</b> Round cells called spermatogonia divide and differentiate eventually to become spermatozoa. During copulation the cloaca or vagina gets inseminated, and then the spermatozoa move through chemotaxis to the ovum inside a Fallopian tube or the uterus.|$|E
25|$|Gene Therapy {{techniques}} {{have the potential}} to provide alternative treatments for those with infertility. Recently, successful experimentation on mice has proven that fertility can be restored by using the gene therapy method, CRISPR. Spermatogenical stem cells from another organism were transplanted into the testes of an infertile male mouse. The stem cells re-established <b>spermatogenesis</b> and fertility.|$|E
25|$|For humans, {{the entire}} process of <b>spermatogenesis</b> is {{variously}} estimated as taking 74 days (according to tritium-labelled biopsies) and approximately 120 days (according to DNA clock measurements). Including the transport on ductal system, it takes 3 months. Testes produce 200 to 300 million spermatozoa daily. However, only about half or 100 million of these become viable sperm.|$|E
25|$|The blood-testis barrier, {{maintained}} by the tight junctions between the Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules, prevents communication between the forming spermatozoa in the testis and the blood vessels (and immune cells circulating within them) within the interstitial space. This prevents them from eliciting an immune response. The blood-testis barrier is also important in preventing toxic substances from disrupting <b>spermatogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{entire process}} of <b>spermatogenesis</b> {{can be broken}} up into several {{distinct}} stages, each corresponding to {{a particular type of}} cell in humans. In the following table, ploidy, copy number and chromosome/chromatid counts are for one cell, generally prior to DNA synthesis and division (in G1 if applicable). The primary spermatocyte is arrested after DNA synthesis and prior to division.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} <b>spermatogenesis</b> is highly {{sensitive}} to {{fluctuations in the}} environment, particularly hormones and temperature. Testosterone is required in large local concentrations to maintain the process, which is achieved via the binding of testosterone by androgen binding protein present in the seminiferous tubules. Testosterone is produced by interstitial cells, also known as Leydig cells, which reside adjacent to the seminiferous tubules.|$|E
25|$|Each cell {{division}} from a spermatogonium to a spermatid is incomplete; the cells remain connected {{to one another}} by bridges of cytoplasm to allow synchronous development. It {{should also be noted}} that not all spermatogonia divide to produce spermatocytes; otherwise, the supply of spermatogonia would run out. Instead, spermatogonial stem cells divide mitotically to produce copies of themselves, ensuring a constant supply of spermatogonia to fuel <b>spermatogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of puberty, {{androgen}} levels increase dramatically in males, and androgens mediate the development of masculine secondary sexual characteristics {{as well as the}} activation of <b>spermatogenesis</b> and fertility and masculine behavioral changes such as gynephilia and increased sex drive. Masculine secondary sexual characteristics include androgenic hair, voice deepening, emergence of the Adam's apple, broadening of the shoulders, increased muscle mass, and penile growth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spermatogenesis</b> {{produces}} mature male gametes, {{commonly called}} sperm but more specifically known as spermatozoa, which {{are able to}} fertilize the counterpart female gamete, the oocyte, during conception to produce a single-celled individual known as a zygote. This {{is the cornerstone of}} sexual reproduction and involves the two gametes both contributing half the normal set of chromosomes (haploid) to result in a chromosomally normal (diploid) zygote.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{with mild}} (or minimal) {{androgen}} insensitivity syndrome (grade 1 on the Quigley scale) are born phenotypically male, with fully masculinized genitalia; this category of androgen insensitivity is diagnosed when {{the degree of}} androgen insensitivity in an individual with a 46,XY karyotype is great enough to impair virilization or <b>spermatogenesis,</b> but is not great enough to impair normal male genital development. MAIS is the mildest and least known form of androgen insensitivity syndrome.|$|E
25|$|To {{preserve}} {{the number of}} chromosomes in the offspring – which differs between species – each gamete must have half the usual number of chromosomes present in other body cells. Otherwise, the offspring will have twice the normal number of chromosomes, and serious abnormalities may result. In humans, chromosomal abnormalities arising from incorrect <b>spermatogenesis</b> results in congenital defects and abnormal birth defects (Down Syndrome, Klinefelter's Syndrome) and in most cases, spontaneous abortion of the developing foetus.|$|E
25|$|In genetic {{males with}} 5α-reductase type II deficiency, the {{prostate}} gland is rudimentary or absent, and if present, remains small, underdeveloped, and unpalpable throughout life. In addition, neither BPH nor prostate cancer {{have been reported}} in these individuals. Genetic males with the condition generally show oligozoospermia due to undescended testes, but <b>spermatogenesis</b> is reported to be normal in those with testes that have descended, and there are case instances of men with the condition successfully fathering children.|$|E
25|$|In humans, the {{preferentially}} expressed antigen of melanoma (PRAME) {{gene family}} is expanded. It is actively expressed in cancers, but normally is testis-specific, possibly involved in <b>spermatogenesis.</b> The PRAME family has 26 members on human chromosome 1. In the macaque, it has eight, {{and has been}} very simple and stable for millions of years. The PRAME family arose in translocations in the common mouse-primate ancestor 85 million years ago, and is expanded on mouse chromosome 4.|$|E
25|$|The wildcat has two estrus periods, one in December–February {{and another}} in May–July. Estrus lasts 5–9 days, with a {{gestation}} period lasting 60–68 days. Ovulation is induced through copulation. <b>Spermatogenesis</b> occurs throughout the year. During the mating season, males fight viciously, and may congregate around a single female. There are records {{of male and female}} wildcats becoming temporarily monogamous. Kittens usually appear in April–May, though some may be born from March–August. Litter size ranges from 1–7 kittens.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of a variant of androgen insensitivity that solely affected <b>spermatogenesis</b> was theoretical at first. Cases of phenotypically normal males with isolated spermatogenic defect due to AR mutation were first detected {{as the result of}} male infertility evaluations. Until then, early evidence in support of the {{existence of}} MAIS was limited to cases involving a mild defect in virilization, although some of these early cases made allowances for some degree of impairment of genital masculinization, such as hypospadias or micropenis. It is estimated that 2-3% of infertile men have AR gene mutations.|$|E
25|$|While {{recombination}} of chromosomes is {{an essential}} process during meiosis, {{there is a large}} range of frequency of cross overs across organisms and within species. Sexually dimorphic rates of recombination are termed heterochiasmy, and are observed more often than a common rate between male and females. In mammals, females often have a higher rate of recombination compared to males. It is theorised that there are unique selections acting or meiotic drivers which influence the difference in rates. The difference in rates may also reflect the vastly different environments and conditions of meiosis in oogenesis and <b>spermatogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The largest {{amounts of}} {{testosterone}} (>95%) {{are produced by}} the testes in men, while the adrenal glands account {{for most of the}} remainder. Testosterone is also synthesized in far smaller total quantities in women by the adrenal glands, thecal cells of the ovaries, and, during pregnancy, by the placenta. In the testes, testosterone is produced by the Leydig cells. The male generative glands also contain Sertoli cells, which require testosterone for <b>spermatogenesis.</b> Like most hormones, testosterone is supplied to target tissues in the blood where much of it is transported bound to a specific plasma protein, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).|$|E
25|$|Another health {{implication}} is {{the depletion of}} folate within the body, where the overexposure to UV light can lead to megaloblastic anemia. Folate deficiency in pregnant women can be detrimental {{to the health of}} their newborn babies in the form of neural tube defects, miscarriages, and spina bifida, a birth defect in which the backbone and spinal canal do not close before birth. The peak of neural tube defect occurrences is the highest in the May–June period in the Northern Hemisphere. Folate is needed for DNA replication in dividing cells and deficiency can lead to failures of normal embryogenesis and <b>spermatogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mild {{androgen}} insensitivity syndrome (MAIS) is {{a condition}} that results in a mild impairment of the cell's {{ability to respond to}} androgens. The degree of impairment is sufficient to impair <b>spermatogenesis</b> and / or the development of secondary sexual characteristics at puberty in males, but does not affect genital differentiation or development. Female genital and sexual development is not significantly affected by the insensitivity to androgens; as such, MAIS is only diagnosed in males. The clinical phenotype associated with MAIS is a normal male habitus with mild spermatogenic defect and / or reduced secondary terminal hair.|$|E
25|$|Spermatozoa are {{the mature}} male gametes in many sexually {{reproducing}} organisms. Thus, eggtogenesis is the male version of gametogenesis, {{of which the}} female equivalent is oogenesis. In mammals it occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the male testes in a stepwise fashion. <b>Spermatogenesis</b> is highly dependent upon optimal conditions for the process to occur correctly, and is essential for sexual reproduction. DNA methylation and histone modification have been implicated in the regulation of this process. It starts at puberty and usually continues uninterrupted until death, although a slight decrease can be discerned in the quantity of produced sperm with increase in age (see Male infertility).|$|E
25|$|At {{least one}} {{contributing}} mechanism for reduced <b>spermatogenesis</b> in cryptorchid testes is temperature. The temperature of testes in the scrotum {{is at least}} a couple of degrees cooler than in the abdomen. Animal experiments in the middle of the 20th century suggested that raising the temperature could damage fertility. Some circumstantial evidence suggests tight underwear and other practices that raise the testicular temperature for prolonged periods can be associated with lower sperm counts. Nevertheless, research in recent decades suggests that the issue of fertility is more complex than a simple matter of temperature. It seems likely that subtle or transient hormone deficiencies or other factors that lead to a lack of descent also impair the development of spermatogenic tissue.|$|E
