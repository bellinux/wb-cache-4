This means that “by and large, you can put any interactional ‘spin’ on any representational content”. What allows meanings from these two modes to freely combine is the intercession of a third, distinct mode of meaning that Halliday {{refers to as the}} textual function. The term encompasses all of the grammatical systems responsible for managing the flow of discourse. These systems “create coherent text - text that coheres within itself and with the context of situation” [...] They are both structural (involving choices relating to the ordering of elements in the clause), and non-structural (involving choices that create cohesive ties between units that have no <b>structural</b> <b>bond).</b> The relevant grammatical systems include Theme, Given and New, as well as the systems of cohesion, such as Reference, Substitution, and Ellipsis. Halliday argues that the textual function is distinct from both the experiential and interpersonal because its object is language itself. Through the textual function, language “creates a semiotic world of its own: a parallel universe, or ‘virtual reality’ in modern terms”.|$|E

How to build and maintain customer loyalty has, therefore, become a sustainable competitive advantage for enterprises. Semiconductor advancements present not only great opportunities, but also great challenges. In order to become a customer oriented enterprise, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) proposes a new concept of “Virtual factory (VF) ”. The results indicate that service innovation of TSMC's eFoundry can strengthen <b>structural</b> <b>bonds,</b> <b>structural</b> <b>bonds</b> can enhance customers' benefits. TSMC not only provides on line services that include design, engineering, and logistics, but also we can see some customers' benefits from creation of service innovation.

The analysis used in this research is two-step regression and to process the data, the SPSS version 21 is used. The findings of this result show that financial and social bonds are able to significantly increase perceived value, whereas social bound is not. The increase of perceived value will be able to increase customer loyalty. The indirect influence of corporate image on loyalty will be mediated by perceived value.

40|$|Background: The {{need to cut}} costs, save money, become profitable, be innovative, improve {{product quality}} and be {{responsive}} to customers’ demands is encouraging some organizations to form strategic relationships with suppliers. In achieving this, certain joint investments, called <b>structural</b> <b>bonds,</b> are developed within the relationship life-cycle. Although the bonds tend to tie down the partners and also create impediments for the termination of the relationship, they inevitably contribute to the achievement of mutual goals and sustaining competitive advantage. Past researches failed to relate the structural bonds’ development {{to any of the}} stages of the relationship life-cycle, which this study investigated. Purpose: The purpose of this research is to investigate why and in which stages of a strategic buyer-supplier relationship are <b>structural</b> <b>bonds</b> initiated. Method: A multiple case study approach, involving four companies, was undertaken to achieve the purpose of this study.

Results: Most of the <b>structural</b> <b>bonds,</b> based on this study, were introduced {{at the beginning of the}} relationships. Some of the reasons for introducing these bonds are: improved product quality, joint product development, knowledge transfer, innovation and communication.

Credit risk and liquidity risk have long been perceived as two of the main justifications for the existence of yield spreads above benchmark Treasury notes or bonds (see Fisher (1959)). Since Merton (1974), a rapidly growing body of literature has focused on credit risk. 1 However, while concern about market liquidity issues has become increasingly marked since the autumn of 1998, 2 liquidity remains a relatively unexplored topic, in particular, liquidity for defaultable securities. 3 This paper develops a <b>structural</b> <b>bond</b> pricing model with liquidity and credit risk. The purpose is to enhance our understanding of both the interaction between these two sources of risk and their relative contributions to the yield spreads on corporate bonds. Throughout the paper, we define liquidity as the ability to sell a security promptly and at a price close to its value in frictionless markets, that is, we think of an illiquid market as one in which a sizeable discount may have to be incurred to achieve immediacy.

40|$|The {{use of an}} {{anti-corrosive}} primer {{has been}} shown to be essential to assure survival of a bonded structure in a hostile environment, particularly if a stress is to be applied to the adhesively bonded joint during the environmental exposure. For example, the Lockheed L- 1011 TriStar assembly, after exhaustive evaluation tests specifies use of chromate filled inhibitive polysulfide sealants, and use of corrosion inhibiting adhesive primers prior to <b>structural</b> <b>bonding</b> with film adhesive...|$|R
40|$|Requirements for the {{adhesives}} {{used on the}} Galileo Jovian probe are discussed, and {{the results}} of mechanical and radiation experiments for their qualification are presented. The five types of adhesives used for the Wide Field Camera, SXA Antenna, temperature control louvers, and <b>structural</b> <b>bonds</b> all passed the proton and electron tests and the low temperature radiation tests. Possible bond improvements through techniques including gamma ray radiation exposure and ion implantation are also considered...|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{discussed}} {{to show how}} Knowledge Management 03, 0 can be used within the buyerseller relationship to heighten customer value, to strengthen <b>structural</b> <b>bonds</b> between partners, and to improve the competitive position of the relationship. This model is used to consider the relationship development process theorized by Dwyer, Schurr, and Oh (1987) and advanced by Wilson (1995) to show how KV affects the buyer-seller relationship. The antecedents and enablers necessary for successful implementation of KM are also discussed...|$|R
