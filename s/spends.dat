40|$|We use a {{quadratic}} {{form in the}} key <b>spending</b> variables to estimate optimal government <b>spending,</b> using World Value Survey data covering 78 countries. We found that the average of total public <b>spending</b> for countries of good public governance, at 36. 45 % of GDP, is almost identical to the average of estimates of optimal public <b>spending</b> at 36. 49 %. However, significant over-spending or under-spending is found for individual countries. Optimal <b>spending</b> on both healthcare and that for education increase with population aging. <b>Spending</b> on education is found to reduce optimal healthcare <b>spending.</b> Per capita GDP increases optimal healthcare <b>spending</b> but reduces optimal education <b>spending</b> {{as a percentage of}} GDP.

40|$|In many {{developing}} countries the proportion of health care <b>spending</b> paid out of pocket is {{about half of all}} <b>spending</b> or more. This study examines the distribution of such <b>spending</b> by income and care type, and the variation in <b>spending</b> about its expected value, in order to see whether voluntary private health insurance that reduces variation in <b>spending</b> might be able to be supplied. Using data from the World Health Survey for 14 developing countries, we find that out of pocket <b>spending</b> varies by income but that most <b>spending</b> usually occurs in income quintiles below the topmost quintile. We use estimates of the variance of total <b>spending,</b> hospital <b>spending,</b> physician <b>spending,</b> and outpatient drug <b>spending</b> about their means to generate estimates of the risk premia risk averse consumers might pay for insurance coverage. For hospital <b>spending</b> and total <b>spending,</b> these risk premia as a percent of expenses are generally larger than reasonable estimates of private health insurer loading as a percent of expenses, suggesting that voluntary insurance might be feasible. However, the strong relationship between <b>spending</b> and income suggests that insurance markets may need to be segmented by income. ...|$|R
