This cleared the way for Burke to participate in the July 7–12 Orlando Summer League. At point guard, the Jazz had traded Randy Foye and were negotiating with Mo Williams. In the NBA Summer League, Trey Burke shot at 24 percent from the field, including 1–19 on three-point shots, while trying to adjust to the pace of the NBA game. He was even benched for a game. Following Burke's Summer League performance, the Jazz signed John Lucas III.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} causal {{estimates of}} the effect of teacher pay on pupil attainment using a sharp geographical discontinuity in teacher salaries. We compare schools in close proximity to a pay zone boundary to estimate the effect of teacher salary differentials on pupil attainment. We find that these differences in <b>salary</b> <b>scales</b> do translate into differences into actual teacher pay levels. However, we find little evidence that higher teacher <b>salary</b> <b>scales</b> increases pupil attainment in national assessments at age 11, and are able to rule out quantitatively small effects of 0. 07 and 0. 02 standard deviations in English and maths, respectively. These results imply that variations in teacher pay of the magnitude we observe (around 5 %) are unlikely to be effective for attracting and retaining higher quality teachers...|$|R

This study analyses the present situation of the construction industry in Sri Lanka with respect to skilled labourer by assessing the need {{to increase the number of}} skilled labourers and their skill level by identifying the causes and effects of the shortage of skilled labour. This paper summarises the results of a survey conducted in Sri Lanka and propose mitigation measures to rectify the problem. This is a timely and needful study in the present context of Sri Lanka with the expected rapid growth of the construction industry especially after the end of the civil war. The objectives of this study are to identify the causes for the shortage of skilled labour in the Sri Lankan construction industry, the resulting effects due to the shortage and to come up with effective mitigation measures. The research was conducted via two types of questionnaire surveys, namely; the individual surveys and the institutional surveys among contractors, consultants and clients represented by Architects, Engineers, Quantity Surveyors, Technical Officers and other similar grades.
