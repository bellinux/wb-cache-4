[...] Seeman (1959: 786) writes that meaninglessness [...] "is characterized by a low expectancy that satisfactory predictions about the future outcomes of behaviour can be made." [...] Where as powerlessness refers to the <b>sensed</b> <b>ability</b> to control outcomes, this refers to the <b>sensed</b> <b>ability</b> to predict outcomes. In this respect, meaninglessness is closely tied to powerlessness; Seeman (Ibid.) argues, [...] "the view that one lives in an intelligible world might be a prerequisite to expectancies for control; and the unintelligibility of complex affairs is presumably conducive to the development of high expectancies for external control (that is, high powerlessness)".|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to exerting {{an effect on}} the nematode via binding to Latrophilin receptors, there is also recent evidence that indicates that emodepside also interacts with the BK potassium channel coded by the gene Slo-1. This protein (see figure for structure) {{is a member of the}} 6 transmembrane helix structural class of potassium ion channels with each subunit consisting of 6 transmembrane helices and 1 P domain (this P domain is conserved in all potassium ion channels and forms the selectivity filter that enables the channel to transport potassium ions across the membrane in great preference to other ions). These subunits group together to form high conductance BK-type channels that are gated by both membrane potential and intracellular calcium levels (this calcium ion <b>sensing</b> <b>ability</b> is accommodated by an intracellular tail region on Slo-like subunits that form a calcium ion binding motif consisting of a run of conserved aspartate residues, termed a “calcium bowl”), with their physiological role being to regulate the excitability of neurons and muscle fibres, through the way in which they participate in action potential repolariziation (with potassium ion efflux being used to repolarize the cell following depolarization).|$|E

40|$|Number sense, {{which can}} broadly {{thought of as}} the ability to quickly understand, approximate, and {{manipulate}} numerical quantities, can be a difficult construct for researchers to operationally define for empirical study. Regardless, many researchers agree it {{plays an important role in}} the development of the symbolic number system, which requires children to master many tasks such as counting, indentifying numerals, comparing magnitudes, transforming numbers and performing operations, estimating, and detecting number patterns, skills which are predictive of later math achievement. The number line is a powerful model of symbolic number consistent with researchers' hypotheses concerning the mental representation of number. The MathemAntics Number Line Activity (MANL) transforms the number line into a virtual manipulative, encourages estimation, provides multiple attempts, feedback, and scaffolding, and introduces a novel features where the user can define his own level of risk on the number line. The aim of the present study was to examine how these key features of MANL are best implemented to promote number sense in low-income second-graders. Sixty-six students from three schools were randomly assigned to one of three conditions; MANL User-Defined Range (UDR), and MANL Fixed Range (FR), and a Reading comparison condition and underwent a pretest session, four computer sessions, and a posttest session. During the computer sessions, researchers coded a child's observed strategy in placing targets on the number line. The results showed that children with higher number <b>sense</b> <b>ability</b> at pretest performed better on a posttest number line estimation measure when they were in the UDR condition than in the FR condition. Conversely, children with low number <b>sense</b> <b>ability</b> at pretest performed better on the number line estimation posttest measure when they were in the FR condition than UDR. Although in general, all children improved over time, children with low number <b>sense</b> <b>ability</b> at pretest were more likely to use the UDR tool ineffectively, thus negatively impacting performance. When children were not coded as responding quickly, target number significantly impacted performance in the computer sessions. Finally, children in the UDR condition utilized better expressed strategies on the number line estimation posttest than children in the Reading comparison group. These findings indicate that prior number <b>sense</b> <b>ability</b> plays a role in how children engage with MANL, which in turn affects the learning benefits the child receives. Implications for researchers, software designers, and math educators, as well as limitations are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Sensor {{networks}} pose {{a number}} of challenging conceptual and optimization problems such as location, deployment, and tracking [1]. One of the fundamental problems in sensor networks is the calculation of the coverage. In [1], {{it is assumed that}} the sensor has the uniform <b>sensing</b> <b>ability.</b> In this paper, we give efficient distributed algorithms to optimally solve the best-coverage problem raised in [1]. Here, we consider the sensing model: the <b>sensing</b> <b>ability</b> diminishes as the distance increases. As energy conservation is a major concern in wireless (or sensor) networks, we also consider how to find an optimum best-coverage-path with the least energy consumption. We also consider how to find an optimum best-coverage-path that travels a small distance. In addition, we justify the correctness of the method proposed in [1] that uses the Delaunay triangulation to solve the best coverage problem. Moreover, we show that the search space of the best coverage problem can be confined to the relative neighborhood graph, which can be constructed locally. I...|$|E
