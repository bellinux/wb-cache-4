Mr Eaves became the managing director and took great pride in motivating the design team.

Pioneering styling features often appeared on Burlingham designs, including the use of curved sightseeing windows above the main windows.

Even before the merger BMH had included theoretically competing marques {{that were in}} fact selling substantially similar [...] "badge engineered" [...] cars. The British Motor Corporation had never properly integrated either the dealer networks or the production facilities of Austin and Morris. This had been done partly to appease poor industrial relations - workers at Cowley for example still perceived themselves as [...] "Morris" [...] employees and still, therefore they refused to assemble cars badged as Austins, and the converse was true at the former Austin plant at Longbridge. The upshot was that both plants were producing badge engineered models of otherwise identical cars so that each network would have a product to sell. This meant that Austin and Morris still, to an extent, competed {{with each other and}} meant that each product was saddled with effectively twice the logistics, marketing and distribution costs that it would have if sold under a single name or if production of a single model platform was concentrated in one factory.

50|$|Coimbatore {{has emerged}} as one of the most trusted {{outsourcing}} destinations for the auto component industry. Several factors have contributed to this growth, including ready availability of resources and skilled technical talent. Technical Partnerships and strategic alliances with global manufacturers have given the Coimbatore auto component industry more mileage in the international market. Today, auto majors with a growing presence in India source both major components and <b>sub</b> <b>assemblies</b> from the city. Several international automotive manufacturers source components ranging from exhaust systems to braking systems, seating, electronic and electrical components, mechanical engine parts, body components and suspensions and radiators among others. Many auto component manufacturing companies are OE partners to multinational brands. Textool was one such company that once designed and supplied Sten Guns to the Indian Government after independence. They alsodeveloped the first in-house-designed car in the 1960s, which never saw the light of day due to the license raj. They made several prototypes until the 1990s. They successfully manufactured India's first indigenously developed diesel engines in 1972 for cars and their own CNC lathes in 1982. Today their spin-off company, Jayem Automotives Pvt Ltd, offers R & D services to Tata Motors, Renault, Volvo Eicher, Daimler, TVS, Hero Motors and Robert Bosch. Maruti Udyog and Tata Motors source up to 30% of their automotive components from Coimbatore.

50|$|The 500 MW {{single shaft}} {{machines}} manufactured by English Electric, are arranged lengthwise along the turbine hall, which is 259.08 m (850 ft) long by 39.624 m (130 ft) wide by 26.060 m (85.5 ft) high. The overall length of each machine is 49.53 m (162.5 ft). The generators are rated at 500 MW, 22 kV at 0.85 power factor. Steam {{conditions at the}} H.P. turbine stop valve are 2,300 psig (158.6 bar). at 566 °C with a single reheat stage to the I.P. cylinder of 565 psia (38.96 bar) at 566 °C. The turbine has a design steam consumption of 6.3932 lb/kWh, including reheating, feed heating, and boiler feed pump drive and an overall heat input of 7,543 Btu/kWh. A novel mounting arrangement was adopted for the turbo-generators. The L.P. cylinders are supported on two steel beams about 22.098 m (72.5 ft) long, which bridge between the concrete blocks at the H.P. steam and generator ends of the sets. The fabricated condenser structure was welded directly to {{the underside of the}} L.P. frame using a pre-heated welding technique. This provides a compact arrangement of the condenser and the main set and is {{a major factor in the}} reduction of size related to the output of the machines, which is a striking feature of the turbine hall. The L.P. frame is supported at its corners, each of the supports taking about 203.2 tonnes (200 tons) in weight. The overall weight of the frame and condenser structure is some 2,235 tonnes (2,200 tons) of which 1,422 tonnes (1,400 tons) is supported on the bottom of the condenser by the mounting springs. The condensers were fabricated on site by English Electric from <b>sub</b> <b>assemblies</b> and welded to the bridge beams supporting the L.P. cylinder. There are over 40,000 9.144 m (30 ft) long, 25.4 mm (1 in) diameter aluminium/brass tubes in each condenser, giving an effective surface area of 27,870 m² (300,000 sq ft) the equivalent of 3.9 football pitches. Operation is at 1.3 inHg with 1,023 m³/min (225,000 gal of cooling water at 15.5 °C. Steam is passed to the condenser at over 963.9 t/h (2,125,000 lb/h). Since contamination of the condensate by the cooling water must be avoided, a double tube plate construction has been adopted in which the condenser tubes are expanded into an extra tubeplate in addition to the one forming the side of the water box. The narrow space between the plates is filled with demineralised water, supplied from a header tank from 48.768 m (160 ft). This provides a pressure considerably higher than the 20 psig developed in the cooling water system, so that any leaks on the tube end plates will be supplied from the header tank.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{wind energy}} plays {{a vital role}} in the world {{renewable}} energy scenario. The modern wind turbine system has a complex and repairable components due to sophistication and centralized control. The failure characteristics of the onshore wind turbines depend on the terrain conditions. In the main mountain pass and hill area, there is a heavy uncertainty in the wind that is due to the frequent change in the direction of wind and the change in the velocity. It causes a rapid failure in the individual <b>sub</b> <b>assemblies.</b> There is a substantial need for improving the reliability in the stages of design, manufacturing, operation and maintenance. Normally the infant mortality failures are more in the onshore wind turbine and the failure rate is constant during normal operating period. It is a surprise that the failure rate has rapidly increased during normal operating period of the wind turbines placed exactly in the mountain pass and hilly area due to the high uncertainty in the wind. This paper deals with reliability analysis of major components of wind turbine system and its sub system such as rotor system, gear box, brake system, generator, hydraulic system and yaw system. This paper also investigates the reliability of wind turbines and its <b>sub</b> <b>assemblies</b> placed at Aramboly pass in India by using Weibull software as reliability tool for a grid connected 250 kW wind turbine. This analysis yields some surprising results about some sub assembly like yaw system, brake system and generator which are most unreliable...|$|E
