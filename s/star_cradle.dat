5000|$|This is {{the first}} Cradle of Filth release since V Empire to feature only one {{full-time}} guitar player (Paul Allender), as former guitarist Gian Pyres quit the band shortly before the writing and recording process. Keyboardist Martin Powell played session guitars for the album as well as keyboards. This is also the first album to feature Dave Pybus on bass. He {{would go on to}} play on all of Cradle's subsequent releases until 2012. Narration on the first track of each section is by David McEwen, who played Kemper in the 2001 horror film Cradle of Fear (also <b>starring</b> <b>Cradle</b> frontman Dani Filth) and appeared in the video for [...] "Her Ghost in the Fog", miming Doug Bradley's vocals.|$|R

40|$|To {{distinguish}} between the different theories proposed to explain massive star formation, {{it is crucial to}} establish the distribution, the extinction, and the density of low-mass stars in massive star-forming regions. We analyze deep X-ray observations of the Orion massive star-forming region using the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) catalog. We studied the stellar distribution as a function of extinction, with cells of 0. 03 pc x 0. 03 pc, the typical size of protostellar cores. We derived stellar density maps and calculated cluster stellar densities. We found that low-mass stars cluster toward the three massive star-forming regions: the Trapezium Cluster (TC), the Orion Hot Core (OHC), and OMC 1 -S. We derived low-mass stellar densities of 10 ^{ 5 } stars pc^{- 3 } in the TC and OMC 1 -S, and of 10 ^{ 6 } stars pc^{- 3 } in the OHC. The close association between the low-mass star clusters with massive <b>star</b> <b>cradles</b> supports the role of these clusters in the formation of massive stars. The X-ray observations show {{for the first time in}} the TC that low-mass stars with intermediate extinction are clustered toward the position of the most massive star, which is surrounded by a ring of non-extincted low-mass stars. This 'envelope-core' structure is also supported by infrared and optical observations. Our analysis suggests that at least two basic ingredients are needed in massive star formation: the presence of dense gas and a cluster of low-mass stars. The scenario that better explains our findings assumes high fragmentation in the parental core, accretion at subcore scales that forms a low-mass stellar cluster, and subsequent competitive accretion. Finally, although coalescence does not seem a common mechanism for building up massive stars, we show that a single stellar merger may have occurred in the evolution of the OHC cluster, favored by the presence of disks, binaries, and gas accretion.

60|$|They saw us safely {{through the}} barriers. M. Darpent gave his word for us, and out {{we went into}} the country while {{scarcely}} the dawn was yet seen. At a turn in the road we saw only the morning star hanging like a great lamp in the east, and I showed it to the little boys, and told them of the three kings led by the <b>Star</b> to the <b>Cradle.</b> I heard afterwards that the little Chevalier thought we saw the real Star in the East sent to guide us to St. Germain, forgetting that it was the wrong direction; but he had been very little taught, and this was the first he had ever heard of the Gospel, which was familiar to my boy. They both fell asleep presently on the cushions, and I think I did so likewise, for I was surprised to find myself at St. Germain in broad daylight. Everybody was gone to mass for the festival, and we crept in after them.|$|R

40|$|Radiative {{feedback}} {{produced by}} stellar populations played {{a vital role}} in early structure formation. In particular, photons below the Lyman limit can escape the star-forming regions and produce a background ultraviolet (UV) flux, which consequently may influence the pristine halos far away from the radiation sources. These photons can quench the formation of molecular hydrogen by photodetachment of H-. In this study, we explore the impact of such UV radiation on fragmentation in massive primordial halos of a few times 107 M ⊙. To accomplish this goal, we perform high resolution cosmological simulations for two distinct halos and vary the strength of the impinging background UV field in units of J 21 assuming a blackbody radiation spectrum with a characteristic temperature of T rad = 104 K. We further make use of sink particles to follow the evolution for 10, 000 yr after reaching the maximum refinement level. No vigorous fragmentation is observed in UV-illuminated halos while the accretion rate changes according to the thermal properties. Our findings show that a few 102 - 104 solar mass protostars are formed when halos are irradiated by J 21 = 10 - 500 at z > 10 and suggest a strong relation between the strength of the UV flux and mass of a protostar. This mode of star formation is quite different from minihalos, as higher accretion rates of about 0. 01 - 0. 1 M ⊙ yr- 1 are observed by the end of our simulations. The resulting massive <b>stars</b> are potential <b>cradles</b> for the formation of intermediate-mass black holes at earlier cosmic times and contribute to the formation of a global X-ray background...|$|R
