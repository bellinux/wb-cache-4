5|$|A cold open shows Trey Atwood (Bradley Stryker) and {{his brother}} Ryan {{stealing}} a car. The police chase and arrest the boys, resulting in a prison term for Trey and a short stay in juvenile hall for the underage Ryan. A conversation between Ryan and his public defender, <b>Sandy</b> Cohen (Peter Gallagher), establishes Ryan as a smart boy with a rough upbringing; he has three truancies and two suspensions, but his SAT I scores are in the ninety-eighth percentile. When Ryan's mother, Dawn (Daphne Ashbrook), collects Ryan, <b>Sandy</b> gives his business card to the boy. At home in Chino, Dawn asks Ryan to leave, and her boyfriend, A.J.

5|$|An {{approaching}} trough {{over the}} central United States induced high wind shear over <b>Sandy</b> as it traversed the Bahamas, causing the hurricane to weaken to {{a tropical storm}} while turning more northeastward. The {{southern part of the}} trough detached, causing the shear to decrease late on October28 and allowing <b>Sandy</b> to regain strength. It attained a secondary peak of Category2 strength the following day, and later turned toward the west. During this change in direction, <b>Sandy</b> began to transition into an extratropical cyclone, a process it completed before making landfall near Brigantine, New Jersey, late on October29. The extratropical remnants weakened gradually overland, and the center of circulation was declared indistinguishable over western Pennsylvania two days later. In addition to becoming the largest Atlantic hurricane, <b>Sandy</b> broke records for the lowest pressures ever observed in many cities across the Northeastern United States.|$|E
