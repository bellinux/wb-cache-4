Szasz argued that all these categories of people were taken as scapegoats of the community in ritual ceremonies. To underscore this continuation of religion through medicine, he even takes as example obesity: instead of concentrating on junk food (ill-nutrition), physicians denounced hypernutrition. According to Szasz, despite their scientific appearance, the diets imposed were a moral substitute to the former fasts, and the social injunction not to be overweight is to be considered as a moral order, not as a scientific advice as it claims to be.

40|$|Background: Females {{are more}} likely than males to {{perceive}} themselves as too heavy, this has been explained in terms of the equation of “female beauty with extreme thinness. ” Therefore, females are in general prone to develop unhealthy behaviors for <b>weight</b> management. <b>Wrong</b> <b>weight</b> control behaviors have significant health consequences. Objectives: To investigate the body weight concerns, body satisfaction, and weight control behaviors among young females and their association with age and socioeconomic status (SES). Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted in urban areas from a major city in South India. About 650 healthy unmarried females aged 15 – 25 years formed the study population. Self-reporting questionnaires were used to obtain relevant data. The categorical data were analyzed using Chi-square, correlation, and regression analyses by SPSS version 16. Results: Most overweight and obese subjects perceived themselves as overweight. Adolescents {{were more likely to report}} themselves as overweight. The perceived weight, body satisfaction, and weight control behaviors are influenced by weight status and age of the subjects. However, SES of the participants did not exhibit effect of others' opinion about their weight and body satisfaction as well as weight management behaviors. Conclusion: The high prevalence of weight-related concerns suggests that all females should be reached with appropriate information and interventions. Healthy weight control practices need to be explicitly promoted and unhealthy practices discouraged. Young females need special attention toward weight management...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{antimicrobial resistance}} of micro-organisms {{is a major}} international concern. Experts believe that the current resistance issues are partly attributable {{to the use of}} antimicrobials in Dutch livestock farming. Because of the increasing resistance the former department of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality demanded a progressive restriction of the use of antibiotics. In 2011 a reduction of 20 % of antibiotic use has to be achieved compared to 2009. In 2013, the use should be halved compared to 2009. 	The use of antibiotics can be reported using the daily dosage per animal year. The daily dosage per animal year is calculated using the daily dosage per kilogram (DDkg) : the amount of an antibiotic necessary (g or ml) for treatment of one kilogram of animal during one day. When this is multiplied with the weight of an (average) animal, one daily dosage results. The daily dosages can be totalled to determine the total exposure to antibiotics in one year and related to the total amount of animals on the farm. This is the daily dosage per animal year. This value can be used to compare the use of antibiotics between different husbandries or even sectors. 	This research is conducted within the practice area of the Academic Practice for Farm Animals ‘Westelijk Weidegebied’. The daily dosage of 100 dairy farmers receiving 4 -weekly coaching was determined, using invoices from the practice management program. Also, the management was mapped using a survey and a visit at the farm. Technical indicators were acquired from CRV. With these data and in part newly developed scoring systems animal health, animal welfare and durability were categorized/determined at the farms. This substudy focuses on sustainability. The sustainability score was plotted against the daily dosage to determine whether a correlation exists. 	There seems to be no correlation between the daily dosage per animal year and the management factors as measured in this study. Possible explanations are faulty scoring, <b>wrong</b> <b>weighting</b> or stockpiling. In addition, there could be an unreliability in the calculated daily dosage due to lack of complete data on the use of antibiotics. It is also possible that there is no correlation between management and antibiotic use...|$|R
40|$|Overweight among {{preschool}} age {{children has}} increased {{at a rapid}} rate and is becoming a worldwide epidemic. Previous research suggests that overweight children are less active and have poorer motor skills than children of normal weight. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess motor skill and physical activity in low-income overweight and normal weight preschool children (ages 3 [...] 5 years) and determine the influence, if any, preschool activity policy had on children 2 ̆ 7 s activity levels.;Data were collected at low-income preschool centers (n = 5) in the state of Iowa. Children (n = 77) ages three to four years were included in the sample. A sub sample was created of normal weight (n = 21) and overweight (n = 25) children based on CDC BMI percentile. Assessment of body composition (skinfold measurements), physical activity levels (accelerometer counts and observed intensity) and motor skill competency (TGMD- 2 process assessment and outcome measures) were completed with the sub sample. The preschool center 2 ̆ 7 s physical activity policy was also reviewed using a policy checklist and teacher interviews.;One-way ANOVA 2 ̆ 7 s for BMI classified weight groups and gender failed to produce significant results for physical activity and motor skill variables. Trends were found in accelerometer counts when groups were based on sum of skinfold measurements rather than BMI. The correlation between BMI percentile and sum of skinfolds was low (r(46) =. 42, p =. 004) and suggested that over one-third of the children were placed in the <b>wrong</b> <b>weight</b> group (inconsistently classified). Trends were also found in accelerometer counts, observed intensity levels and locomotor TGMD- 2 scores when groups were based on agreement between BMI percentile and sum of skinfold. These trends showed small shifts in confidence intervals between groups and small effect sizes. Generally, overweight preschool children appear to have the same activity levels and motor skill proficiency as their normal weight peers as determined by small effect sizes and confidence intervals. Of the inconsistently classified children, those who had high BMI 2 ̆ 7 s and low sum of skinfolds were better at locomotor skills that involved power (i. e. run, leap, throw, kick) when compare to children with low BMI 2 ̆ 7 s and high sum of skinfolds. There was little variability in the preschool activity policies, and the strength of preschool policy had no effect on children 2 ̆ 7 s activity levels or motor skills. Based on these finding, BMI may lack validity as a means of classifying obesity in young children...|$|R

Firstly, it is shown that classical devices are not suitable. They are unable to predict the behaviour of magnetic sheets under their real working conditions:the distribution of the flux density through the section of the <b>sheets</b> is <b>wrong</b> and the anisotropy of magnetic permeability is not correctly taken into account[l][2]. Then, the results are useless to compute and design electrical machines. Then, we describe a new measurement device to enable us to test either circular smooth or slotted samples, {{with the use of a}} suitable electromagnetic travelling wave. analogous to that of the airgap of the real electrical machine[2]. Finally, we give the first results obtained with the first device realized in our Laboratory.

NON SUITABILITY OF CLASSICAL DEVICES 1. 1 Flux density distribution through the thickness of the sheets Using numerical 2 D computations, we compare the magnetic flux distribution through the thickness of electric sheets in a laminated part of the magnetic circuit of a rotating machine, in an Epstein frame and a ((single sheet tester)) (SST).

A Reification {{of history}} painting; is an exegesis that contextualizes {{a series of}} painted re-enactments, using published, non-fictional and fictional {{examples}} of Australian Gothic literature as their originating subject matter. By modifying Krauss' model of the expanded field model painting can be broadened to provide an agency that includes among other additional qualifiers the dualities of history, politics, fantasy and documentation. This adapted model provides schematic locations {{that are able to}} accommodate instances of a multiple, concurrent subjective historiography. Each year Australian historical societies gather to act out significant historical events; The Battle of Vinegar Hill in Sydney's North West is one of these.

These stories become narratives and dramas set in uncanny historical landscapes...|$|R

40|$|This Essay {{offers a}} {{utilitarian}} perspective on Martha Nussbaum 2 ̆ 7 s theory of justice. Nussbaum believes that society should guarantee to every individual a threshold level of central human capabilities. Although Nussbaum 2 ̆ 7 s approach has considerable appeal, it is implausible and unappealing when it diverges greatly from utilitarianism. Nussbaum 2 ̆ 7 s theory sequires that enormous {{sums of money}} be devoted to people who receive very little benefit from efforts to raise them toward a capability threshold. Moreover, Nussbaum refitses to take a principled position on how conflicts among below-threshold interests should be resolved, even when one alternative would produce enormously more good than another alternative. Nussbaum mitigates these problems through an implicit incorporation of utilitarianism to address conflicts among below-threshold interests, but this partial adoption of utilitarianism cannot completely cure her theory. In addition to critiquing Nussbaum 2 ̆ 7 s theory, this Essay responds to some of Nussbaum 2 ̆ 7 s criticisms of utilitarianism. It rejects Nussbaum 2 ̆ 7 s claim that utilitarianism is <b>wrong</b> to give <b>weight</b> to adaptive preferences.
