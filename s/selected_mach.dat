40|$|An imperfectly {{expanded}} supersonic jet, invariably, radiates both broadband {{noise and}} discrete frequency sound called screech tones. Screech tones {{are known to}} be generated by a feedback loop driven by the large scale instability waves of the jet flow. Inside the jet plume is a quasi-periodic shock cell structure. The interaction of the instability waves and the shock cell structure, as the former propagates through the latter, is responsible for the generation of the tones. Presently, there are formulas that can predict the tone frequency fairly accurately. However, there is no known way to predict the screech tone intensity. In this work, the screech phenomenon of an axisymmetric jet at low supersonic Mach number is reproduced by numerical simulation. The computed mean velocity profiles and the shock cell pressure distribution of the jet are found to be in good agreement with experimental measurements. The same is true with the simulated screech frequency. Calculated screech tone intensity and directivity at <b>selected</b> jet <b>Mach</b> number are reported in this paper.

Ten combinations of gases and Mach numbers are studied in which the free-stream Mach numbers range from 0. 2 to 4.

It is the Mach number in a coordinate system convecting with the velocity of the dominant waves and structures of the shear layer, called here the convective Mach number. It happens to have nearly the same value for each stream. In the current experiments, it ranges from 0 to 1. 9. The correlations of the growth rate with convective Mach number fall approximately onto one curve when the growth rate is normalized by its incompressible value at the same velocity and density ratios.

40|$|Windtunnel {{tests were}} carried out {{with the aim of}} {{establishing}} a measured unsteady surface pressure data set in and around a box-shaped shallow cavity, subject to tangential flow in the transonic Mach number range. Apart from the baseline case, for which systematic Mach number and Reynolds number variations were completed, the main purpose of the tests was to investigate the effect of certain upstream mounted passive flow control devices on the cavity oscillations for <b>selected</b> <b>Mach</b> numbers. This chapter contains the description of two baseline case data sets of unsteady surface pressures for freestream Mach number M*= 0. 8 and M*= 1. 33 respectively, made available to RTO. The main purpose of the experiment was to test techniques for the passive control of pressure occurring in and near cavities exposed to tangential transonic flows. Moreover, the phase relation among the different cavity modes were investigated since the design of devices (passive and especially active) for control, critically depends on the knowledge and an understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the resonances driving the phenomenon. Despite its long term investigation and the corresponding vast literature on cavity oscillations, reliable prediction schemes exist only for the frequencies of the oscillation modes. An insight into the phase relations among the modes however is necessary e. g. in order to lay out the characteristics of a controller for a closed loop active control of the oscillations. Therefore the present tests were also performed to reveal the spatiotemporal phase relation among the modes in the cavity. The tests were done in the DLR wind tunnel TWG (Transonic Windtunnel Göttingen) in November 1997. The closed system tunnel has a test section area of 1 m x 1 m and is operated continuously. The cavity oscillation model is mounted on a cropped sting and consists basically of a flat plate, containing the cutout for the box-shaped cavity of length L = 0. 202 m, width W = 0. 03 m and depth D = 0. 05 m, which in turn is hosted in the fuselage carrying the model (for details of the geometry see section 2 and Figures 1 - 5). Unsteady surface pressures were measured using flush mounted Kulite pressure transducers as specified in Table 1 and Figures 1 and 5. The static pressures at three positions on the plate surface upstream of the cavity (details see section 7) were measured {{in order to determine the}} actual Mach number of the flow above the cavity. A geometrical angle of attack of alpha = 1 ° was set in order to assure non-separating flow at the sharp leading edge of the plate. The cavity's bottom surface was made of an aluminium plate, which could be translated along the x-direction (streamwise) with the help of a remote-controlled electric motor. Six equally (in x) spaced Kulite sensors were flush mounted into the moveable plate. It was possible to take measurements at arbitrary x-positions of the cavity's bottom surface by moving the plate (and thus the six sensors) to the desired setting. For each flow parameter this was done for 12 positions of the plate. From one position to the next, the plate was advanced upstream in steps of 3 mm. For each of these settings the time histories of all Kulite sensors (including all non-moveable sensors) were recorded simultaneously along with the static flow data. Thus for each of the 12 positions the phase relation between all sensors can be evaluated...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} research concerning highly underexpanded jets made of different gases {{from the surrounding}} ambient is here described. By selecting different species of gases, {{it was possible to}} vary the jet-to-ambient density ratio in the 0. 04 - 12 range and observe its effect on the jet morphology. By adjusting the stagnation and ambient pressures, it has been possible to <b>select</b> the <b>Mach</b> number of the jets, independently from the density ratio. Each jet is therefore characterized by its maximum Mach number, ranging from 10 to 50. The Reynolds number range of the nozzle is 103 - 5 × 104. The spatial evolution of the jets was observed over a much larger scale than the nozzle diameter. The gas densities were evaluated from the light emission induced by an electron beam and the gas concentrations were obtained by analyzing the color of the emitted light. The results have shown that the morphology of the jets depends to a greater extent on the density ratio. Jets that are lighter than the ambient exhibit a more intense jet-ambient mixing than jets that are heavier than the ambient, while the effects of changing the jet Mach number {{do not seem to be}} too large in the explored range. These results can be expressed by means of two simple scaling laws relevant to the near field (pre-Mach-disk) and the mid-long term field (post-Mach-disk), respectively.

40|$|To {{advance the}} design of {{hypersonic}} vehicles, high-fidelity multi-physics CFD is used to characterize 3 -D scramjet flow-fields in two novel streamline traced configurations. The two inlets, Jaws and Scoop, are analyzed and compared to a traditional rectangular inlet used as a baseline for on/off-design conditions. The flight trajectory conditions <b>selected</b> are <b>Mach</b> 6 and a dynamic pressure of 1, 500 psf (71. 82 kPa). Analysis of these hypersonic inlets is performed to investigate distortion effects downstream with multiple single cavity combustors acting as flame holders, and several fuel injection strategies. The best integrated scramjet inlet/combustor design is identified. The flow physics is investigated and the integrated performance impact of the two innovative scramjet inlet designs is quantified. Frozen and finite rate chemistry is simulated with 13 gaseous species and 20 reactions for an Ethylene/air finite-rate chemical model. In addition, URANS and LES modeling are compared to explore overall flow structure and to contrast individual numerical methods. The flow distortion in Jaws and Scoop is similar {{to some of the}} distortion in the traditional rectangular inlet, despite design differences. The baseline and Jaws performance attributes are stronger than Scoop, but Jaws accomplishes this while eradicating the cowl lip interaction, and lessening the total drag and spillage penalties. The innovative inlets work best on-design, whereas for off-design, the traditional inlet is best. Early pressure losses and flow distortions in the isolator aid the mixing of air and fuel, and improve the overall efficiency of the system. Although the trends observed with and without chemical reactions are similar, the former yields roughly 10 % higher mixing efficiency and upstream reactions are present. These show a significant impact on downstream development. Unsteadiness in the combustor increases the mixing efficiency, varying the flame anchoring and combustion pressure effects upstream of the step. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Dr. Stephen M.

40|$|Active {{and passive}} methods {{for control of}} {{hypersonic}} boundary layers have been experimentally examined in NASA Langley Research Center wind tunnels on a Hyper-X model. Several configurations for forcing transition using passive discrete roughness elements and active mass addition, or blowing, methods were compared in two hypersonic facilities, the 20 -Inch Mach 6 Air and the 31 -Inch Mach 10 Air tunnels. Heat transfer distributions, obtained via phosphor thermography, shock system details, and surface streamline patterns were measured on a 0. 333 -scale model of the Hyper-X forebody. The comparisons between the active and passive methods for boundary layer control were conducted at test conditions that nearly match the nominal Mach 7 flight trajectory of an angle-of-attack of 2 -deg and length Reynolds number of 5. 6 million. For the passive roughness examination, the primary parametric variation was a range of trip heights within the calculated boundary layer thickness for several trip concepts. The prior passive roughness study resulted in a swept ramp configuration being <b>selected</b> for the <b>Mach</b> 7 flight vehicle that was scaled to be roughly 0. 6 of the calculated boundary layer thickness.
