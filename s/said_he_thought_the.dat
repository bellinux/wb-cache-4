5|$|For his part, Thompson <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> {{judge was}} trying to protect Moore's {{criminal}} conviction at any cost. He also complained about the judge's ethics, saying a local attorney {{who claimed to have}} influence on the judge had assured him the case would be dismissed unless the attorney was on Thompson's team, and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous comments about him on their website.|$|E
5|$|Because of Billingsley's long-standing {{friendship}} with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) head J. Edgar Hoover, rumors persisted that the Stork Club was bugged. During {{his work on}} the Stork Club book, author and New York Times reporter Ralph Blumenthal was contacted by Jean-Claude Baker, one of Josephine Baker's sons. Having read an article by Blumenthal about Leonard Bernstein's FBI file, he indicated that he had read his mother's FBI file and by comparing the file to the tapes, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> Stork Club incident was overblown.|$|E
5|$|Frank Oz said The Land of Gorch {{experiment}} had its positives and negatives. Oz <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> routine {{was not a}} {{good fit}} for Saturday Night Live, and that the cartoon-style humor of their characters did not work well with the comedy of Saturday Night Live, much of which was initially derived from the Second City environment. Oz said he generally enjoyed working on Saturday Night Live and witnessing the skill of performers such as Andy Kaufman, Albert Brooks, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, and Dan Aykroyd.|$|E

5|$|The first preview {{screening}} of the 113-minute version of The Rules of the Game took place on June 28, 1939. It received a poor reaction from the audience. On June 29 the film was screened for the Minister of National Education and Fine Arts Jean Zay and for the jury of the annual Louis Delluc Prize for the best French film. When the awards were announced ten days later Marcel Carne's Le Quai des brumes won the first prize and The Rules of the Game was not a runner-up. Because of the success and popularity of Renoir's previous films, The Rules of the Game was highly anticipated and Zay had expected to award it the prize. Renoir later <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> film would be commercially successful.|$|E
5|$|Some {{passengers}} and crew members who called from the aircraft using the cabin airphone service and mobile phones provided details: several hijackers were aboard each plane; they used mace, tear gas, or pepper spray to overcome attendants; and some people aboard had been stabbed. Reports indicated hijackers stabbed and killed pilots, flight attendants, and one or more passengers. According to the 9/11 Commission's final report, the hijackers had recently purchased multi-function hand tools and assorted Leatherman-type utility knives with locking blades, which were not forbidden to passengers at the time, but were not found among the possessions {{left behind by the}} hijackers. A flight attendant on Flight 11, a passenger on Flight 175, and passengers on Flight 93 said the hijackers had bombs, but one of the passengers <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> bombs were fake. The FBI found no traces of explosives at the crash sites, and the 9/11 Commission concluded that the bombs were probably fake.|$|E

25|$|At a {{news conference}} {{five days after the}} crash, NASCAR {{officials}} announced that the left lap belt on Earnhardt's seat belt harness had broken. Dr. Steve Bohannon, NASCAR's medical expert, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> faulty belt had allowed Earnhardt's chin to strike the steering wheel, causing the fatal basilar skull fracture. This led to speculation that Earnhardt would have survived if his seat belt had not broken.|$|E
25|$|Brady {{returned}} from his knee injury in the AFC Championship Game to start in Super Bowl XXXVI a week later in New Orleans. Despite being heavy underdogs, the Patriots played well, holding the Rams' high powered offense in check through the first three quarters. The Rams rallied from a 17–3 deficit {{to tie the game}} with 1:30 left in regulation. The Patriots then got the ball back at their own 17-yard line with no timeouts remaining. Sportscaster and former Super Bowl-winning coach John Madden <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> Patriots should run out the clock and try to win the game in overtime. Instead, Brady drove the Patriots' offense down the field to the Rams' 31-yard line before spiking the ball with seven seconds left. Then kicker Adam Vinatieri converted a 48-yard field goal as time expired to give the Patriots a 20–17 win and their first ever league championship. Brady was named MVP of Super Bowl XXXVI while throwing for 145 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions. At the age of 24 years and six months, Brady surpassed Joe Namath in Super Bowl III and Joe Montana in Super Bowl XVI, who were both 25 years, seven months, and 13 days old {{at the time of their}} victories, to earn the title of youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl. A possible quarterback controversy was averted when Bledsoe was traded to the Buffalo Bills during the offseason; this event cemented Brady's status as the starting quarterback.|$|E

500|$|The {{engineer}} company {{started its}} attack {{up the mountain}} about noon of September 4, following a trail up a southern spur. The 1st Platoon was in the lead, single file, followed by the 2nd and 3rd Platoons. Palmer considered the mission so important {{that he and his}} military intelligence officer, Captain Rene J. Guiraud, accompanied the engineers. Platoon Sergeant James N. Vandygriff, 2nd Platoon, D Company, in a brief conversation with Holley as he went ahead of the latter on his way up the trail, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> attack was a [...] "suicide mission".|$|E
500|$|Since the 1960s, Gehry {{has made}} artistic use of scaled {{animals such as}} fish and snakes, which first {{appeared}} in his architectural designs in the 1980s.

Kamin calls it [...] "a bridge that resembles a giant silver snake, complete with a scaly skin", while Gehry <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> bridge looked like a river, but added {{he might be the}} only one who thought that.|$|E
500|$|Bruce Smith {{finished}} {{the game with}} a single sack and eight tackles, and cited his poor performance on the time spent away from practice and in court. Other Virginia Tech players cited the court battle as a distraction during game preparations, and it was also thought that many Air Force players were inspired by the increased media coverage given Virginia Tech. Air Force coach Fisher DeBerry <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> storm of pre-game publicity about Smith helped his team. [...] "It seemed like everybody forgot the Air Force was in town," [...] he said. [...] "The thing that motivated the team was the challenge of playing against them with him in the lineup." ...|$|E

500|$|Near Drew's Station, {{just outside}} Contention City, a man {{stepped into the}} road and {{commanded}} them to [...] "Hold!" [...] Three Cowboys attempted to rob the stage. Paul, in the driver's seat, fired his shotgun and emptied his revolver at the robbers, wounding a Cowboy later identified as Bill Leonard in the groin. Philpot, riding shotgun, and passenger Peter Roerig, riding in the rear dickey seat, were both shot and killed. The horses spooked and Paul wasn't able to bring the stage under control for almost a mile, leaving the robbers with nothing. Paul, who normally rode shotgun, later <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> first shot killing Philpot had been meant for him.|$|E
500|$|... "Blood Ties" [...] {{featured}} the first appearances of Peter Gerety, Jon Seda and Callie Thorne as regular cast members on [...] Thorne portrayed Laura Ballard, a former Seattle homicide unit detective, marking the character's {{first appearance in}} the series. Gerety and Seda each previously played their respective characters in guest appearances on the show; Seda's character Paul Falsone {{first appeared in the}} two-part [...] finale. Stuart Gharty, Gerety's character, is described as a transplant from the department's internal affairs department. Executive producer Tom Fontana <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> new cast additions would create drama and tension between the characters: [...] "It's stimulating to add new people, because you're not feeling like you're writing or acting the same scene for the thousandth time, and I think all three of them are very different than any other characters we've had on the show." ...|$|E
500|$|Vollmer {{started as}} thatgamecompany's [...] "feel engineer" [...] in August 2012, but left in April 2013 to [...] "go indie" [...] {{and work on}} his own projects.

Vollmer tried to write a short story {{in an attempt to}} take a break from games. Before long, he began to play with his {{computer}} keyboard. Vollmer challenged himself to make a game that only used the arrow keys, and prototyped what would become Threes in ten hours overnight. He proceeded to iterate on the idea with Wohlwend over the game's 14-month development. In Threes, the player slides numbered tiles on a four-by-four grid to combine addends and multiples of three. Vollmer cited Drop7 as an inspiration for the game, having played it for two years beforehand.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> {{episode was}} {{an improvement over}} the pilot episode, which he also enjoyed. Sepinwall said the episode seemed to distance the Leslie character from Michael Scott, Steve Carell's character on The Office, and gave more for the supporting cast to do; he particularly praised Schneider and Ansari. Matt Fowler of IGN said Amy Poehler [...] "remains frighteningly unflappable" [...] and said he enjoyed how disastrous the town hall meeting turned out to be, but said supporting characters like Mark and Ron [...] "need to be fleshed out a bit more and made... well, funnier." [...] Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune said [...] "Canvassing" [...] was funnier than the pilot episode, but still lacked big laughs and [...] "I think the writers can do some interesting things with the whole playground plot, among them introducing us to some of Pawnee's more colorful denizens." ...|$|E
500|$|The use of {{a safety}} car to start the race had a mixed {{response}} within the sport. Massa thanked Whiting in the media; {{he said he felt}} Whiting [...] "did an excellent job of managing the situation, making the right decisions as to when to start the race and when to bring in the Safety Car at the right moment". Schumacher, Petrov, Sutil and Buemi also agreed with the decision to start under safety-car conditions. Hamilton said he felt the length of time under safety-car conditions was not [...] "good for the spectators and it's not fun for the drivers". He additionally felt the track was dry enough for a normal restart. BBC commentator and former driver Martin Brundle said he felt the race should have started at an earlier time, while Button <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> event should have been stopped before visibility became poor. Nevertheless, the Grand Prix was awarded the Race Promoters Trophy at the FIA Gala Awards held in Monte Carlo in December 2010.|$|E
500|$|Sonny Bunch of The Washington Times said, [...] "The {{episode was}} both funny and smart, a wry {{commentary}} on the inherent trickiness of marketing a rebellious art form infused with sexuality to children who have no business being sexually active themselves." [...] Tamar Anitai, a blogger for MTV, said the episode was [...] "hilarious". He said [...] "The South Park writers actually appeared to sympathize, if not side with, the Jonas Brothers ... In the end, Disney and Christianity ended up getting a far more severe skewering than the Jonas Brothers." [...] Alan Sepinwall, television writer for The Star-Ledger, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> Mickey Mouse character {{was used as an}} effective satirical device for corporate greed, but said he was not particularly impressed with the overall episode because [...] "its targets — the Jonas Brothers, and the Disney company for using them to sell sex to little girls with impunity — were so easy to hit". In contrast, Parents Television Council (PTC), criticized the episode for such elements, and they named this episode the [...] "Worst Cable Content of the Week".|$|E
