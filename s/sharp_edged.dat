A newer variant of gray iron, referred to as ductile iron is specially treated with trace amounts of magnesium to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, reducing the stress concentrations and vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.|$|E

60|$|Hence shadows are in reality, {{when the}} sun is shining, the most {{conspicuous}} thing in a landscape, next to the highest lights. All forms are understood and explained chiefly by their agency: the roughness of the bark of a tree, for instance, is not seen in the light, nor in the shade: it is only seen between the two, where the shadows of the ridges explain it. And hence, if we have to express vivid light, our very first aim must be to get the shadows sharp and visible; and this is not to be done by blackness, (though indeed chalk on white paper is the only thing which comes up to the intensity of real shadows,) but by keeping them perfectly flat, keen, and even. A very pale shadow, if it be quite flat--if it conceal the details of the objects it crosses--if it be gray and cold compared to their color, and very <b>sharp</b> <b>edged,</b> will be far more conspicuous, and make everything out of it look a great deal more like sunlight, than a shadow ten times its depth, shaded off at the edge, and confounded with the color of the objects on which it falls. Now the old masters of the Italian school, in almost all of their works, directly reverse this principle: they blacken their shadows till the picture becomes quite appalling, and everything in it invisible; but they make a point of losing their edges, and carrying them off by gradation; in consequence utterly destroying every appearance of sunlight. All their shadows are the faint, secondary darknesses of mere daylight; the sun has nothing whatever to do with them. The shadow between the pages of the book which you hold in your hand is distinct and visible enough, (though you are, I suppose, reading it by the ordinary daylight of your room,) out of the sun; and this weak and secondary shadow is all that we ever find in the Italian masters, as indicative of sunshine. Even Cuyp and Berghem, though they know thoroughly well what they are about in their foregrounds, forget the principle in their distances; and though in Claude's seaports, where he has plain architecture to deal with, he gives us something like real shadows along the stones, the moment we come to ground and foliage with lateral light, away go the shadows and the sun together. In the Marriage of Isaac and Rebecca, in our own gallery, the trunks of the trees between the water-wheel and the white figure in the middle distance, are dark and visible; but their shadows are scarcely discernible on the ground, and are quite vague and lost in the building. In nature, every bit of the shadow would have been darker than the darkest part of the trunks, and both on the ground and building would have been defined and conspicuous; while the trunks themselves would have been faint, confused, and indistinguishable, in their illumined parts, from the grass or distance. So in Poussin's Phocion, the shadow of the stick on the stone in the right-hand corner, is shaded off and lost, while you see the stick plain all the way. In nature's sunlight {{it would have been the}} direct reverse--you would have seen the shadow black and sharp all the way down, but you would have had to look for the stick, which in all probability would in several places have been confused with the stone behind it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Boundary element {{method in}} {{acoustics}} for Neumann boundary condition problems including <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners is investigated. In previous acoustic boundary element method, acoustic pressure and normal velocity {{are the two}} variables at <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners. However, the normal velocity at <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners is discontinuous due to the indefinite normal vector. To avoid the indefinite normal vector and the discontinuous normal velocity at <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners, normal vector of elemental node is defined and applied in the numerical implementation. Then the normal velocity is transformed to velocity which is unique even at <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners. Such treatments {{make sure that all}} variables in the acoustic boundary element method are definite. Computational efficiency and accuracy of the new model are demonstrated by three cases of interior acoustic problems for which analytical solutions can be found and one classical exterior acoustic radiation problem. Curvilinear quadrilateral isoparametric elements are applied in the computation. It is found that the numerical results agree with corresponding analytical solutions quite well...|$|R
