50|$|<b>Shock</b> testing {{typically}} {{falls into}} two categories, classical <b>shock</b> testing and pyroshock or ballistic <b>shock</b> testing. Classical <b>shock</b> testing {{consists of the}} following <b>shock</b> impulses: half sine, haversine, sawtooth wave, and trapezoid. Pyroshock and ballistic <b>shock</b> tests are specialized and are not considered classical <b>shocks.</b> Classical <b>shocks</b> can be performed on Electro Dynamic (ED) Shakers, Free Fall Drop Tower or Pneumatic <b>Shock</b> Machines. A classical <b>shock</b> impulse is created when the <b>shock</b> machine table changes direction abruptly. This abrupt change in direction causes a rapid velocity change which creates the <b>shock</b> impulse.|$|R

Furthermore, the dynamics of <b>shocks,</b> i. e, the time evolutions of <b>shocks,</b> and the propagation of <b>shocks</b> {{are studied in detail}} by using the quantitative models. The approach of this paper can be applied to any economic <b>shocks,</b> particularly, price <b>shocks,</b> technology <b>shocks,</b> unemployment <b>shocks,</b> and outer capital flow <b>shocks.</b> As an example, we investigate the interaction of price <b>shock</b> and exchange rate <b>shock.</b> At the same time, we also discuss the macroeconomic policy’s effects on economic business cycle...|$|R

40|$|Configurations of corotating <b>shocks</b> in {{the outer}} {{heliosphere}} are computed {{on the assumption that}} the <b>shocks</b> move at constant speeds between collisions. The basic physical process is the interaction of a forward <b>shock</b> with a reverse <b>shock.</b> The points at which this interaction takes place are determined algebraically in terms of the initial <b>shock</b> positions and speeds. Between the points at which the <b>shocks</b> interact, the <b>shocks</b> have the form of Archimedian spirals. <b>Shock</b> configurations are determined for the case of two corotating <b>shock</b> pairs originating at 2. 5 AU and for a single <b>shock</b> pair at 2. 5 AU. In both cases the heliosphere is divided into several distinct regions distinguished by the number of times the particles have passed through a <b>shock.</b> Since the <b>shock</b> strengths decrease when a forward <b>shock</b> interacts with a reverse <b>shock,</b> corotating <b>shocks</b> are expected to be weaker at larger distances from the sun...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} collisionless <b>shocks</b> is posed {{as the problem}} of {{understanding}} how in a completely collisionless streaming high-temperature plasma <b>shocks</b> can develop at all, forming discontinuous transition layers of thickness much less than any collisional mean free path length. The history of <b>shock</b> research is briefly reviewed. It is expressed that collisionless <b>shocks</b> as a realistic possibility {{of a state of}} matter have been realized not earlier than roughly half a centruy ago. The basic properties of collisionless <b>shocks</b> are noted in preparing the theory of collisionless <b>shocks</b> and a classification of <b>shocks</b> is given in terms of their physical properties, which is developed in the following chapters. The structure of this chapter is as follows: 1.

40|$|Unsignalled, inescapable <b>shocks</b> were {{presented}} to four albino rats in Experiment 1.

One subject changed to a density of signalled <b>shock</b> eight times that of unsignalled <b>shock.</b> The second study showed that the two <b>shock</b> schedules most similar in Experiment 1 were discriminably different because subjects chose lower over higher <b>shock</b> densities when both densities were unsignalled.

40|$|There {{is little}} {{consensus}} concerning {{the sources of}} fluctuations in real exchange rates. In this paper I assess {{the nature of the}} <b>shocks</b> that drive the real U.

I next use an alternative empirical approach, in which I identify various types of real and nominal <b>shocks.</b> I find that output <b>shocks</b> and monetary <b>shocks</b> account for approximately the same percentage of the variance of the real exchange rate over short horizons. The monetary <b>shock</b> is decomposed into monetary base and money multiplier <b>shocks</b> and the output <b>shock</b> is decomposed into supply and demand <b>shocks.</b> Essentially all of the effect of the combined output <b>shock</b> is due to the demand <b>shock.</b> The effect of the monetary <b>shock</b> is accounted for by both money multiplier <b>shocks</b> and monetary base <b>shocks</b> in roughly equal amounts.

40|$|I {{estimate}} the decomposition of {{total factor productivity}} (TFP) <b>shocks</b> by two sectors: (a) investment and (b) consumption.

I find that surprise <b>shocks</b> to investment sector drive recession in short run. In contrast, positive comovements in response to TFP news <b>shocks</b> to investment sector immediately trigger economic boom. A two-sector DSGE (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium) model confirms that price rigidity of investment goods is a key factor to generate {{the responses to the}} sector-specific TFP surprise <b>shocks</b> and news <b>shocks</b> as the empirical response: high rigidity for the surprise <b>shocks</b> and low rigidity for the new <b>shocks.</b> This result suggests that the model should adjust with the degree of the price rigidity depending on the surprise <b>shocks</b> or the news <b>shocks...</b>|$|R

50|$|One of {{the primary}} uses of <b>shock</b> polars is {{in the field of}} <b>shock</b> wave reflection.
