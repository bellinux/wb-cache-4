5|$|The {{impact of}} the {{conflict}} was not all positive from the French perspective. The revolts in Tyrol and the Kingdom of Westphalia during the conflict were an indication that there was much discontent over French rule among the German population. Just {{a few days before}} the conclusion of the Treaty of Schönbrunn, an 18-year-old German named Friedrich <b>Staps</b> approached Napoleon during an army review and attempted to stab the emperor, but he was intercepted in the nick of time by General Rapp. The emerging forces of German nationalism were too strongly rooted by this time, and the War of the Fifth Coalition played an important role in nurturing their development. By 1813, when the Sixth Coalition was fighting the French for control of Central Europe, the German population was fiercely opposed to French rule and largely supported the Allies.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSpace Time Adaptive Processing (<b>STAP)</b> is a {{two-dimensional}} adaptive filtering technique which uses jointly {{temporal and spatial}} dimensions to suppress disturbance.

In {{order to}} use the <b>STAP</b> in {{reverberation}} suppression, and compare the performances of <b>STAP</b> for underwater LFM with CW, the method of <b>STAP</b> used for LFM was proposed. Firstly, the principle of <b>STAP</b> for CW was analyzed, according to the underwater echo of CW. Then, the space-time steering vector of LFM is deduced by analysing the underwater echo of LFM. Fianlly, the performances of <b>STAP</b> for LFM and CW were compared by simulations. The {{results show that the}} proposed method of <b>STAP</b> for underwater LFM with narrower modulation bandwidth can achieve a better performance in target detection and estimate, and the processing gain of <b>STAP</b> for CW is higher than that of LFM form 1. 6 dB to 5. 5 dB with the modulation bandwidth from 100 Hz to 600 Hz...|$|R
2500|$|Pelagial was {{initially}} conceived as an instrumental album. [...] Robin <b>Staps</b> explained in September 2012, while {{the album was}} still under development, that Pelagial would be largely or entirely instrumental. [...] "The reasons are manifold, but there simply is no space on this album, both from a musical {{as well as from}} a conceptual point of view, for lyrics and vocals. Loïc [...] {{is going to continue to}} be our vocalist, but the time is now right for instrumental metal. We need more of this." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} Pelagial is multi-dimensional. [...] The first, most literal, level {{involves}} a {{journey from the}} surface to the lowest depth zone of the ocean, with the album's movements getting progressively darker and more claustrophobic to mimic the diminishing light and increasing atmospheric pressure. [...] However, at a second, allegorical level, the ocean layers serve as an extended metaphor for a journey into the inner depths of the psyche. [...] Guitarist and songwriter Robin <b>Staps</b> described this aspect of Pelagial as a movement [...] "towards the essence and origins of our desires, wishes, dreams, and all the fucked up attributes inside of our own inner selves that generate and shape them" [...] and {{said that there are}} [...] "a lot of Freud-like references" [...] in the lyrics and song titles.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent to {{the band}} {{recording}} the instrumental album, {{it was announced that}} Rossetti had recently recovered from a disorder affecting his voice and would indeed contribute vocals to Pelagial. [...] Some editions of the album include a second disc featuring the all-instrumental version of Pelagial with an alternate mix. Guitarist Jona Nido later explained the band's reversal: [...] "Loïc is the frontman of this band and we all felt that The Ocean and this album needed him... I'm glad we decided to record vocals in the end, because it really adds a new dimension to the album that was not there before." [...] <b>Staps</b> later said that Rossetti's vocal health was [...] "part of the reason we decided to have it instrumental originally". [...] He confirmed that part of the logic for releasing both the vocal and instrumental versions of the album was that the band can shift to an instrumental configuration for live performances if Rossetti's health problems return.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{approach}} for target direction of arrival (DOA) estimation based on deterministic space time adaptive processing (<b>STAP)</b> is presented. Deterministic <b>STAP</b> [1] represents a valid alternative to stochastic <b>STAP</b> in fast varying interference scenarios, {{due to its}} intrinsic single snapshot interference cancellation characteristics. On the other hand, in its classical derivation, detection performances of deterministic <b>STAP</b> are severely deteriorated in case of uncertainty in {{the knowledge of the}} exact target DOA. Reformulating the deterministic <b>STAP</b> problem in terms of convex optimization, a robust deterministic <b>STAP</b> technique has been derived in [2] which takes into account a possible mismatch between the nominal and the actual target DOA. In this paper, the robust deterministic <b>STAP</b> filter is applied to retrieve an accurate estimation of the actual target DOA based on a closed form formula. Such target DOA estimates may serve in tracking scenarios to keep updated the target parameters knowledge in successive coherent processing intervals (CPIs) ...|$|R
30|$|However, the MIMO <b>STAP</b> {{can be more}} {{challenging}} owing to the extra DOFs produced by orthogonal transmitted waveforms. Inevitably, the rank of clutter and jammer subspace will increase and the <b>STAP</b> of MIMO radar will be more complex. When full adaptive processing is implemented, large computational complexity caused by the matrix inversion operation and the challenging number of training samples will prevent the practical implementation of <b>STAP.</b> This can be even more serious when the numbers of array elements and pulses in a coherent processing interval (CPI) are both large. Fortunately, reduced-dimension (RD) and reduced-rank (RR) <b>STAP</b> algorithms are able to relieve the heavy computational burden for MIMO radar while maintaining good performance. The key objective of RD/RR <b>STAP</b> is to reduce computational cost and thus improve statistical convergence. RD <b>STAP</b> cut back the adaptive DOFs physically by transformation that is data independent [6]; while RR <b>STAP</b> projects the received data into a lower dimensional subspace spanned {{by a set of}} basis vectors utilizing a data-dependent transformation.|$|R
