40|$|Methyl ethyl ketone {{peroxide}} (MEKPO) possesses complex structures {{which have}} caused many incidents involving fires or explosions by mixing with incompatible substances, external fires, and others. In this study, reactivities or incompatibilities of MEKPO with inorganic acids (HCl, HNO 3, H 3 PO 4 and H 2 SO 4) were assessed by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) and vent sizing package 2 (VSP 2). Parameters obtained by the above-mentioned devices could be readily employed to discuss the runaway reaction, such as onset temperature (T- 0), heat of reaction (Delta H-d), time to maximum rate (TMR), maximum <b>self</b> <b>heat</b> rate (dT/dt) (max) adiabatic temperature rise (Delta T-ad), maximum pressure of decomposition (P-max) and so on. Mixing MEKPO with hydrochloric acid resulted in the lowest T- 0 among inorganic acids.

The necessary values for the heat generation as function of temperature were measured with an isothermal-isoperibolic microcalorimeter. By using an adiabatic calorimeter, e. g. the 'Accelerating Rate Calorimeter' (ARC), {{it is possible to}} determine the characteristic data of the self heating directly. The <b>self</b> <b>heat</b> rates and the pressure increase rates of the following explosives and propellants were measured: PETN, NQ (Nigu), TAGN, RDX, TNT, pure AN, single base GP A 5020, LOVA type GP KHP 230 and KHP 281, energetic binder GAP and solutions of GAP in toluene and dioxane. The onset temperature of the self heating was always much below the corresponding deflagration temperature measured at 5 Cel/min heat ing rate of Wood's bath. All substances, except AN and the solutions, deflagrated after a 'controlled' self heating. These transition temperatures were also below the deflagration temperatures.

40|$|Seven {{formulations}} {{based on}} epsilon-CL 20 (epsilon-HNIW, hexanitrohexazaisowurtzitane), ammonium perchlorate, GAP binder and the energetic plasticizers TMETN, BTTN and GAP-A {{have been investigated}} by adiabatic self heating measured by an ARCTM (Accelerating Rate Calorimeter) in the temperature range 120 °C to 190 °C. The formulations {{have been designed to}} get high burning rates for the application in high velocity tactical missiles. According to the behaviour of the adiabatic self heating the formulations split into two groups. The significant difference in composition is that the first group contains no GAP-A, only TMETN as energetic plasticizer and the second group with five formulations contains GAP-A between 9 and 14 mass-%. The first group reaches deflagration during self heating in shorter times and at lower temperatures between 155 and 160 °C. The second group shows deflagration above 183 °C. These formulations evolved heats of decomposition of about 240 J/g which is twice as high as the ones from the first group. The group containing GAP-A shows retardation of the adiabatic <b>self</b> <b>heat</b> rate between 160 °C and 175 °C. This effect is assigned to the phase transition of å-CL 20 to ã-CL 20.

40|$|In {{the course}} of {{experiments}} to perform deprotonation and carbonization of doped polyani-line (PANI) nanotubes (NTs) by irradiating directly 2. 45 GHz microwave (MW) in our microwave heating system (MWHS), we have discovered that the PANI-NTs <b>self</b> <b>heat</b> by absorbing the MW, but {{the temperature of the}} PANI-NTs stops rising around 300 °C in spite of the heightened MW power. Furthermore, we have found that the MW irradiated PANI-NTs have transferred from electrical conductor to insulator depending on the temperature of the PANI-NTs. By measuring electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of the MW heated PANI-NTs, the existence of the unpaired electrons is shown to have a strong correlation between the degree of MW absorption and the transition in the electrical conductivities. In order to deprotonate and carbonize further the PANI-NTs, we have performed heat treatment for the PANI-NTs up to a temperature (THT) of about 1200 °C in the same MWHS using carbon fiber which self heats by absorbing MW.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{availability of}} less expensive {{power and the}} increasing plant modification and maintenance costs have caused some utilities to re-examine the economics of nuclear power. As a result, several utilities have opted to permanently shutdown their plants. Each licensee of these permanently shutdown (PSD) plants has submitted plant-specific exemption requests for those regulations that they believe are no longer applicable to their facility. This report presents a regulatory assessment for generic BWR and PWR plants that have permanently ceased operation in support of NRC rulemaking activities in this area. After the reactor vessel is defueled, the traditional accident sequences that dominate the operating plant risk are no longer applicable.

40|$|Understanding {{the complex}} {{cellular}} and molecular mechanisms that regulate the immune response {{remains one of}} the major challenges in immunology. A key question is how the immune system is regulated in order to control a protective immune response and prevent chronic and destructive immunopathology. Within the adaptive immune system CD 4 + T cells are keyplayers in the initiation and orchestration of immune responses. However, there is now increasing evidence that subsets of CD 4 + T cells are also important negative regulators. Amongst these, the so-called naturally occurring CD 4 +CD 25 + Tregs and IL- 10 producing Tr 1 cells are the best characterized. The ability of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to control many facets of the immune response suggests that they might be used as targets for new therapeutic strategies. In {{the first part of this}} thesis we explored the presence and functionality of different subsets of Tregs in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). We identified and characterized <b>self</b> <b>heat</b> shock protein 60 (HSP 60) specific T cells (chapter 2) and we studied the frequency, phenotype and functionality of naturally occurring CD 4 +CD 25 + Tregs in JIA patients (chapter 3). Subsequently, we explored the role of human HSP 60 in the induction and function of CD 4 +CD 25 + Tregs using PBMC of healthy controls and tried to further classify the human HSP 60 specific T cells (chapter 4). In the second part of this thesis we evaluated the safety and effectiveness of Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) for refractory JIA by studying 34 JIA patients transplanted in 9 different transplantation centers within Europe (chapter 5). Furthermore, we explored the mechanisms that are attributable to the induction of tolerance by ASCT and identified CD 4 +CD 25 + Tregs as one of the keyplayers in this induction (chapter 6). Taken together the studies described in this thesis may contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of JIA as well as of the physiology of regulatory immune responses in general. We identified different subsets of Tregs as crucial players in the tolerization process. Furthermore, it identified human HSP 60 being the first known physiological human antigen, naturally present at inflammatory sites and able to activate Tregs. This knowledge may be pivotal in designing the new immunoregulatory strategies for JIA and other autoimmune diseases...|$|E

40|$|Several {{varieties}} of linseed oil are commercially available, {{and they have}} been used for many applications especially in decorative furniture finishing and as an oil painting medium. The addition of metallic driers to the linseed oil is a common practice, as it improves the drying rate of the paint. Several cases of fires have been reported, often involving rags soaked with linseed oil which have not been disposed of properly, and it is generally agreed that metal salts in the linseed oil {{play an important role in}} the spontaneous ignition of the oil. This paper investigates several types of linseed oil sold in the market and their tendency to cause self-heating of cotton which has been impregnated with linseed oil obtained from various sources. Experiments were performed in two reactors; a plug flow reactor for measurement of gaseous oxidation products and in a batch system for the determination of metal composition in the oil. Both plug flow and batch systems employ fifty percent of oxygen and nitrogen mixtures for several hours in each experiment. Emission of gaseous products during the reaction was quantified by micro gas chromatography (μGC), and identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Oil samples from batch system were digested using microwave and the metal composition was determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Boiled linseed oil is the most reactive oil studied, followed by raw linseed oil and refined linseed oil which display similar reactivity, while the least reactive is stand linseed oil. ICP analysis confirmed the presence of cobalt in the boiled linseed oil, which enhances the rate of oxidation reaction. For boiled linseed oil, the cobalt in the oil enhances the decomposition of peroxide resulting in the formation of various radicals which oxidize the oil and the cotton wool, therefore the emission of gaseous products is higher during oxidation on the cotton wool support compared to glass wool and thus boiled linseed oil has the highest tendency to <b>self</b> <b>heat,</b> especially if soaked on the cotton or rags. A kinetic model of peroxide formation and decomposition has been developed based on the experimental data. The reaction rate constant of the decomposition of peroxide has been found to be higher in the reaction using cobalt compared to that of without cobalt, confirming the role of cobalt in catalysing the peroxide decomposition reaction. Abstraction reactions by the radicals during oxidation lead to subsequent reactions which are generally very exothermic. Accumulation of sufficient heat, can ultimately lead to the temperature reaching the ignition point of the oil and causing the self- heating and even ignition of the oil...|$|E
40|$|The {{transuranic}} metals, neptunium and plutonium, {{are strong}} alpha emitters {{and have to}} be handled under special conditions to safeguard the health of those working with them. The most common method of containing these metals is to use glove boxes but in certain circumstances it is possible to encapsulate specimens for experimental purposes. The relative merits of the use of glove boxes and sealed capsules for cryogenic experiments are discussed in this thesis. A further consequence of the high alpha activity of these metals is their property of self heating. This <b>self</b> <b>heat</b> {{is a result of the}} absorption by the crystal lattice of the kinetic energies of the alpha particle and the recoil nucleus. At room temperature this has little or no effect on the physical properties of these metals but at low temperatures it is possible for the defects produced in the lattice to remain in equilibrium with their surroundings. The resistivities of alpha and delta stabilised plutonium, neptunium and uranium 233 are found to increase when these metals are held at low temperatures for long periods of time. Little work on the self-irradiation of uranium 233 and neptunium has been undertaken because of their low self heats and the consequent long self-irradiation times necessary to cause a significant increase in their low temperature resistivities. The storage and annealing of defects in alpha and delta stabilised plutonium have however been studied in considerable detail. The resistivity of alpha plutonium has an extremely anomalous temperature dependence. As the temperature falls from room temperature the resistivity first rises slowly to a maximum at ~  195 °K, then drops sharply as the temperature is further lowered to zero. Its residual resistivity is high and very sensitive to small impurity concentrations. It is found that over a period of about 5, 000 hours at ~  5 °K the resistivity of alpha plutonium increases from between ~  20 and ~  5 μΩ cm. to approximately 140 - 145 μΩ cm.; some 15 - 20 μΩ cm. lower than the value of the resistivity maximum and ~  105 °K. Furthermore the additional resistivity caused by self-irradiation at ~  5 °K does not obey Matthiessen's rule and it is found that after long periods of self-irradiation at ~  5 °K the resistivity measured at ~  77 °K has decreased by about 15 - 20 μΩ cm. More detailed investigation of the increase in resistivity during self-irradiation at ~  5 °K shows that the additional resistivity decreases steadily with increase in temperature, becoming zero at ~  55 °K and then negative above ~  55 °K. In contrast, self-irradiation at ~  77 °K causes an increase in the resistivity both at ~  5 °K and ~  77 °K. The resistivity of delta stabilised plutonium also increases when held at low temperatures for long periods of time. The initial rate of resistivity increase is however much lower than that of alpha plutonium and is found to be dependent on the concentration of aluminium used to stabilise the delta phase. Although the resistivity of delta stabilised plutonium increases initially at a lower rate than alpha plutonium it does not saturate so quickly and eventually rises to values considerably in excess of that of its original resistivity maximum. The additional resistivity produced in alpha plutonium is found to anneal in two distinct stages. The first stage is centred about 80 °K and analysis shows that the activation energy of the recovery process is approximately 0. 2 eV. At 90 °K the anneal is found to be characterised by second order reaction kinetics but it is difficult to analyse simply anneals carried out at ~  77 °K. The second annealing stage in alpha plutonium is centred at ~  160 °K and gradual annealing occurs up to room temperature where all but a few percent of the original resistivity increase have annealed. It is found that annealing in delta stabilised plutonium sets in at a lower temperature than in alpha plutonium, that the first annealing stage in delta plutonium is enhanced at the expense of the second stage and that a larger percentage of the resistivity increase remained unannealed after warming to room temperature. None of the theories proposed to explain the low temperature properties of plutonium has as yet gained universal acceptance and it is therefore difficult to give an unequivocal explanation of the results presented in this thesis. The various theories of the low temperature properties of plutonium are reviewed and discussed and it is shown that the behaviour of alpha and delta stabilised plutonium during self-irradiation may be best explained by assuming that they are both anti-ferromagnetic at low temperatures. Such an assumption is not unreasonable in view of the close similarity between the actinide and lanthanide series of metals. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{specific}} {{heat of the}} transuranic metals, plutonium and neptunium, has been measured below room temperature. Both these metals are strong α-emitters and are extremely toxic. As a consequence {{they have to be}} handled under special conditions, and the usual methods are either by containment in glove boxes or by encapsulation. The latter method has been adopted here and developed such that the calorimeter formed the encapsulation, and the canned specimens could then be handled in an inactive cryostat. A further consequence of the high α-activity of these metals is their property of 'self-heating', which makes the determination of their {{specific heat}} by the conventional continuous-heating method impossible. The magnitude of the self-heat, particularly of plutonium, meant that a continuous heating method had to be evolved which could deal with the inevitable high rates of rise of temperature. A cryostat and measuring system were constructed and developed such that the specific heat could still be determined with reasonable accuracy. A control system was also developed in order that an adiabatic technique could be employed. The self-heat is temperature independent and was utilised as a constant power supply to the calorimeter. A review of the literature values of the half-lives and decay energies of the various radioactive isotopes present in any sample of a transuranic metal, is given since the calculation of the <b>self</b> <b>heat</b> is critically dependent of these quantities. The specific heat (C P) of α-plutonium was not found to exhibit the large and irreproducible peaks which characterised the early work of Sandenaw. C P followed a smooth 'sigmoid' curve, except for a small 'excess' between 40 – 70 °K the magnitude of the excess (~  2. 5 – 3 %) was not sufficient to produce a maximum on C P. C P values were generally high, rising to a value of 7. 86 cals. /mole/deg. at 300 °K, and analysis of the data gave an electronic coefficient (γ) of 38 × 10 − 4 cals. /mole/deg. 2 and Debye theta (θ D) values between 150 and 170 °K in the temperature range ~  14 – 300 °K. Further analysis and separation of the excess, yielded a contribution to the specific heat which had the typical λ-shape of a magnetic transition, though the energy and entropy involved were extremely small. One of the main theories proposed to explain the unusual low temperature properties of plutonium {{is that there is a}} paramagnetic-antiferromagnetic transition at ~  60 °K, and the present specific heat work would indicate that this is not an unreasonable hypothesis. Lack of affirmative evidence from neutron diffraction experiments however has necessitated a review and discussion of the alternative theories proposed, and also a comparison with the known antiferromagnetic α-manganese, to which many parallels exist. Short term self-irradiation experiments were carried out on α-plutonium. The magnitude of the energy stored by the defects produced by storage at low temperatures, and the temperature range in which this annealed out, were found to give satisfactory agreement with the theoretical estimates and the self-irradiation damage effects previously observed on the electrical resistivity. The specific neat of α-neptunium was found to be a smooth curve throughout the range of measurement of ~  7. 5 – 300 °K, and the values of γ = 34 × 10 − 4 cals. /mole/deg. 2 and θ 0 = 187. 5 °K resulted from analysis of the low temperature region. No evidence of any magnetic phenomena which must always be in mind in view of the close similarities between the actinide and lanthanide series of metals, was seen on α-neptunium in keeping with the bulk of the other known properties. Neptunium however is still only available in very limited quantities and in a state of purity that is by no means high (~  99 %). In view of the large electronic coefficients observed in plutonium and neptunium, a discussion is given on the baud structures of the actinides in relation to their electronic properties. The analyses of the specific beat dats are dependent in the first place on a reduction of C P to C V. Lack of sufficient data on the expansion coefficients (α L) of plutonium and neptunium, led to the measurement of α L for these two metals in the temperature range 20 – 300 °K. A simple push-rod dilatometer technique was used, and expansion coefficients of ~  45 × 10 − 6 /deg. for α-Pu and ~  20 × 10 − 6 /deg. for α-Np were found. The Grüneisen gamma values were ~  2. 6 for α-Pu and ~  1. 8 for α-Np respectively. The development of reactor fuel materials has caused a great deal of interest to be centred on the carbides of uranium and plutonium. Since no previous specific heat determination had been carried out below roots temperature on PuC, this was investigated down to ~  12. 5 °K. Other low properties of this metallic carbide had again suggested antiferromagnetic behaviour below 100 °K. No evidence in support of this was found on the specific heat results though an extremely high density of states at the Fermi surface is suggested. The standard thermodynamic functions of plutonium, neptunium and plutonium monocarbide have been calculated and are tabulated in the appendices. </p...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} investigation of nonequilibrium effects and <b>self</b> <b>heating</b> in single electron transfer devices {{based primarily on}} the Coulomb blockade effect. During an electron trapping process, a hot electron may be deposited in a quantum dot or metal island, with an extra energy usually {{on the order of}} the Coulomb charging energy, which is much higher than the temperature in typical experiments. The hot electron may relax through three channels: tunneling {{back and forth to the}} feeding lead (or island), emitting phonons, and exciting background electrons. Depending on the magnitudes of the rates in the latter two channels relative to the device operation frequency and to each other, the system may be in one of three different regimes: equilibrium, non-equilibrium, and <b>self</b> <b>heating</b> (partial equilibrium). In the quilibrium regime, a hot electron fully gives up its energy to phonons within a pump cycle. In the nonequilibrium regime, the relaxation is via tunneling with a distribution of characteristic rates; the approach to equilibrium goes like a power law of time (frequency) instead of an exponential. This channel is plagued completely in the continuum limit of the single electron levels. In the <b>self</b> <b>heating</b> regime, the hot electron thermalizes quickly with background electrons, whose temperature $T_e$ is elevated above the lattice temperature $T_l$. We have calculated the coefficient in the well known $T^ 5 $ law of energy dissipation rate, and compared the results to experimental values for aluminum and copper islands and for a two dimensional semiconductor quantum dot. Moreover, we have obtained different scaling relations between the electron temperature and operation frequency and device size for various types of devices.

2500|$|The power {{dissipated}} in a thermistor {{is typically}} maintained {{at a very}} low level to ensure insignificant temperature measurement error due to <b>self</b> <b>heating.</b> However, some thermistor applications depend upon significant [...] "self heating" [...] to raise the body temperature of the thermistor well above the ambient temperature so the sensor then detects even subtle changes in the thermal conductivity of the environment. Some of these applications include liquid level detection, liquid flow measurement and air flow measurement.|$|R
