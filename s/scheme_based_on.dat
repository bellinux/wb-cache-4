5|$|In 1910, Eaton {{became the}} first {{scientist}} to publish a more {{detailed description of the}} entire Pteranodon skeleton, as it was known at the time. He used his findings to revise the classification of the genus once again based on {{a better understanding of the}} differences in pteranodont anatomy. Eaton conducted experiments using clay models of bones to help determine the effects of crushing and flattening on the shapes of the arm bones Williston had used in his own classification. Eaton found that most of the differences in bone shapes could be easily explained by the pressures of fossilization, and concluded that no Pteranodon skeletons had any significant differences from each other besides their size. Therefore, Eaton was left to decide his classification <b>scheme</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> differences in the skulls alone, which he assigned to species just as Marsh did, by their size. In the end, Eaton recognized only three valid species: P. occidentalis, P. ingens, and P. longiceps.|$|E

The aim {{is to reduce the}} cost of signature-then-encryption approach. This cost includes computational cost and communication cost. Furthermore some signcryption <b>schemes</b> are <b>based</b> <b>on</b> RSA while some are <b>based</b> <b>on</b> elliptic curve. This paper provides a critical review of the signcryption <b>schemes</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> elliptic curves, since signcryption <b>schemes</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> elliptic curve cryptography saves more computational time and communication cost.

40|$|In our {{previous}} work, we {{have studied the}} performance of three data distribution schemes, Send Followed Compress (SFC), Compress Followed Send (CFS), and Encoding-Decoding (ED), for sparse arrays <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the traditional matrix representation (TMR) scheme. Since multi-dimensional arrays can also be represented by the extended Karnaugh map representation (EKMR) scheme, in this paper, we first apply the SFC, the CFS, and the ED schemes for multi-dimensional sparse arrays <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the EKMR <b>scheme.</b> Then, we compare the performance of these three <b>schemes</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the EKMR <b>scheme</b> with those <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the TMR <b>scheme.</b> Both theoretical analysis and experimental test were conducted. In theoretical analysis, we analyze the SFC, the CFS, and the ED <b>schemes</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the TMR and the EKMR schemes {{in terms of the}} data distribution time and the data compression time. In experimental test, we implemented these three <b>schemes</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the TMR and the EKMR schemes on an IBM SP 2 parallel machine. From the experimental results, the ED scheme outperforms the CFS scheme that outperforms the SFC scheme for most of test sparse arrays.

The value distribution is similar to floating point, but the value-to-representation curve (i.e., the graph of the logarithm function) is smooth (except at 0). Conversely to floating-point arithmetic, in a logarithmic number system multiplication, division and exponentiation are simple to implement, but addition and subtraction are complex.

Kessel led the Penguins in playoff scoring with 10 goals and 22 points and also led the team in shots with 98. Kessel narrowly missed winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP, falling short of teammate and captain Sidney Crosby by three points.

30|$|It was {{demonstrated}} that an improvement of numerical accuracy can be attained by utilizing numerical <b>schemes</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> HLLI and MuSIC Riemann solvers rather than <b>schemes</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> 1 -D HLL solvers. In particular, for 1 -D RMHD solvers, the HLLI Riemann solver provides the theoretical minimum dissipation of the Alfven wave and contact discontinuities that can still ensure a numerically stable scheme. In SectionÂ  4, {{we discussed the}} multidimensional extension of HLLI RMHD Riemann solver; the RMHD MuSIC Riemann solver. It is in higher dimensions that we see an even larger improvement over <b>schemes</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> 1 -D HLL solvers. The MuSIC Riemann solver was shown to significantly reduce the dissipation of Alfven waves {{in large part to}} its ability to resolve the strongly interacting region that is typically ignored in <b>schemes</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> 1 -D HLL Riemann solvers. We also show that very high order schemes might be free of the excessive dissipation that arises from a lower quality Riemann solver. However, that transition occurs only when schemes of fourth and higher order of accuracy are used.|$|R
50|$|Many lattice-based {{cryptographic}} schemes {{are known}} to be secure assuming the worst-case hardness of certain lattice problems. I.e., if there exists an algorithm that can efficiently break the cryptographic scheme with non-negligible probability, then there exists an efficient algorithm that solves a certain lattice problem on any input. In contrast, cryptographic <b>schemes</b> <b>based</b> <b>on,</b> e.g., factoring would be broken if factoring were hard ``on an average input, even if factoring were in fact hard in the worst case. However, for the more efficient and practical lattice-based constructions (such as <b>schemes</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> NTRU and even <b>schemes</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> LWE with more aggressive parameters), such worst-case hardness results are not known. For some schemes, worst-case hardness results are known only for certain structured lattices.|$|R
25|$|The {{staircase}} {{is followed}} by the Norman Porch, a square landing distinguished by its central clustered column and the intricate ceiling it supports, which is made up of four groin vaults with lierne ribs and carved bosses. The Porch was named for its proposed decorative <b>scheme,</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> Norman history. In the event, neither the planned statues of Norman kings nor the frescoes were executed, and only the stained-glass window portraying Edward the Confessor hints at this theme. Queen Victoria is depicted twice in the room: as a young woman in the other stained-glass window, and near the end of her life, sitting on the throne of the House of Lords, in a copy of a 1900 painting by Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant which hangs on the eastern wall. The sixteen plinths intended for the statues now house busts of prime ministers who have sat in the House of Lords, such as the Earl Grey and the Marquess of Salisbury. A double door opposite the stairs leads to the Royal Gallery, and another to the right opens to the Robing Room.|$|E
