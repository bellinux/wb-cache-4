5|$|Sclerocytes secrete the mineralized spicules ("little spines") {{that form}} the <b>skeletons</b> <b>of</b> many sponges and in some species provide some defense against predators.|$|E
5|$|G. minor {{is unusual}} because it {{frequently}} is found with embryonic <b>skeletons</b> <b>of</b> the enantiornithine bird Gobipipus. These embryos have well-developed wings, which suggest {{they would be}} able to fly very soon after hatching, unlike most modern birds.|$|E
5|$|Many {{researchers}} consider {{there to}} be at least two species of Pteranodon. However, aside from the differences between males and females described above, the post-cranial <b>skeletons</b> <b>of</b> Pteranodon show little to no variation between species or specimens, and the bodies and wings of all pteranodonts were essentially identical.|$|E
50|$|The appendicular <b>skeleton</b> <b>of</b> 126 {{bones and}} the axial <b>skeleton</b> <b>of</b> 80 bones {{together}} form the complete <b>skeleton</b> <b>of</b> 206 {{bones in the}} human body. Unlike the axial skeleton, the appendicular skeleton is unfused. This allows for a much greater range of motion.|$|R

40|$|Let $C$ be a curve over a {{complete}} discretely valued field $K$. We give tropical {{descriptions of the}} weight function attached to a pluricanonical form on $C$ and the essential <b>skeleton</b> <b>of</b> $C$. We show that the Laplacian of the weight function equals the pluricanonical divisor on Berkovich skeleta, and we describe the essential <b>skeleton</b> <b>of</b> $C$ as a combinatorial <b>skeleton</b> <b>of</b> the Berkovich <b>skeleton</b> <b>of</b> the minimal $snc$-model. In particular, if $C$ has semi-stable reduction, then the essential skeleton coincides with the minimal skeleton. As an intermediate step, we describe the base loci of logarithmic pluricanonical line bundles on minimal $snc$-models...|$|R
5|$|The German {{psychologist}} Adolf Zeising (1810–1876) {{claimed that}} the golden ratio was expressed in the arrangement of plant parts, in the <b>skeletons</b> <b>of</b> animals and the branching patterns of their veins and nerves, {{as well as in}} the geometry of crystals.|$|E
5|$|The Plateosaurus skeletons in a {{clay pit}} of the Tonwerke Keller AG in Frick, Switzerland, were first noticed in 1976. While the bones are often {{significantly}} deformed by taphonomic processes, Frick yields <b>skeletons</b> <b>of</b> P.engelhardti comparable in completeness and position {{to those of}} Trossingen and Halberstadt.|$|E
5|$|Homology was {{noticed by}} Aristotle (c. 350 BC), and was {{explicitly}} analysed by Pierre Belon in his 1555 Book of Birds, where he systematically compared the <b>skeletons</b> <b>of</b> birds and humans. The pattern of similarity was interpreted {{as part of}} the static great chain of being through the mediaeval and early modern periods: it was not then seen as implying evolutionary change.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, {{the museum}} {{acquired}} the <b>skeleton</b> <b>of</b> a sperm whale, and in 2008, it acquired the <b>skeleton</b> <b>of</b> a North Atlantic right whale which was pregnant {{at the time}} of its death.|$|R
50|$|The 1-skeleton of a {{polyhedron}} or polytope is {{the set of}} vertices and {{edges of}} the polytope. The <b>skeleton</b> <b>of</b> any convex polyhedron is a planar graph, and the <b>skeleton</b> <b>of</b> any k-dimensional convex polytope is a k-connected graph. Conversely, Steinitz's theorem states that any 3-connected planar graph is the <b>skeleton</b> <b>of</b> a convex polyhedron; for this reason, this class of graphs {{is also known as}} the polyhedral graphs.|$|R
5|$|The Melbourne Museum and Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa both {{feature a}} <b>skeleton</b> <b>of</b> the pygmy blue whale. The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh, North Carolina, has a mounted <b>skeleton</b> <b>of</b> a blue whale.|$|R
5|$|Radiocarbon dated {{samples from}} the cromlech show the tomb was {{accessed}} by many generations {{over a period of}} 300–800years, and that the human bones are the disarticulated remains (i.e., not complete <b>skeletons)</b> <b>of</b> at least 40individuals: male and female adults, adolescents, children, and infants. One of the red deer bones has been radiocarbon dated to between 2750BP and 2150BP, showing {{that at least some of}} the bones entered long after the site had been deserted.|$|E
5|$|The University Museum of Natural History {{holds the}} university's zoological, entomological and {{geological}} specimens. It {{is housed in}} a large neo-Gothic building on Parks Road, in the university's Science Area. Among its collection are the <b>skeletons</b> <b>of</b> a Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops, and the most complete remains of a dodo found anywhere in the world. It also hosts the Simonyi Professorship of the Public Understanding of Science, currently held by Marcus du Sautoy.|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} of Christians during the Persian invasion of 614 at the Mamilla Pool, attributed by a Christian chronicler to Jewish revenge {{after years of}} Byzantine repression, was documented by an archaeological find in a chapel containing hundreds of human <b>skeletons</b> <b>of</b> urban dwellers of both sexes and of relatively young age. The site of the chapel is now covered over by the Mamilla Mall parking house.|$|E

5|$|The oldest dinosaur embryos ever {{discovered}} {{were found}} in the park in 1978. The eggs were from the Triassic Period (220 to 195 million years ago) and had fossilised foetal <b>skeletons</b> <b>of</b> Massospondylus, a prosauropod dinosaur. More examples of these eggs have since been found in the park. Other fossils found in the park include those of advanced cynodontia (canine toothed animals), small thecodontia (animals with teeth set firmly in the jaw), bird-like and crocodile-like dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Animal remains {{have been}} found in the wreck of the Mary Rose. These include the <b>skeletons</b> <b>of</b> a rat, a frog and a dog. The dog, a mongrel between {{eighteen}} months and two years in age, was found near the hatch to the ship's carpenter's cabin and is thought to have been brought aboard as a ratter. Nine barrels {{have been found}} to contain bones of cattle, indicating that they contained pieces of beef butchered and stored as ship's rations. In addition, the bones of pigs and fish, stored in baskets, have also been found.|$|E
5|$|Burial 48 is {{generally}} accepted as {{the tomb of}} Siyaj Chan K'awil. It is located beneath Temple 33 in the North Acropolis. The chamber of the tomb was cut from the bedrock and contained {{the remains of the}} king himself together with those of two adolescents who had been sacrificed in order to accompany the deceased ruler. The walls of the tomb were covered with white stucco painted with hieroglyphs that included the Long Count date equivalent to 20 March 457, probably the date of either the death or interment of the king. The king's skeleton was missing its skull, its femurs and one of its hands while the <b>skeletons</b> <b>of</b> the sacrificial victims were intact.|$|E

5|$|More {{complete}} aetosaur {{remains were}} found from the Lower Stubensandtein of Germany in the 1870s. Among them were complete articulated <b>skeletons</b> <b>of</b> 22 aetosaurs. These specimens {{were found in}} a large sandstone outcrop near Stuttgart and were preserved together in an area less than 2 square metres in size. The animals were probably buried under lake sediment soon after they died, with {{the flow of water}} repositioning their bodies on the lake bed and putting them in close proximity to one another. In 1877, German paleontologist Oskar Fraas assigned these specimens to the newly erected genus Aetosaurus. Fraas named the genus after the skull's resemblance to the head of an eagle, with a narrow, elongate skull and a pointed snout.|$|E
5|$|The tail of Dimetrodon {{makes up}} {{a large portion of}} its total body length and {{includes}} around 50 caudal vertebrae. Tails were missing or incomplete in the first described <b>skeletons</b> <b>of</b> Dimetrodon; the only caudal vertebrae known were the eleven closest to the hip. Since these first few caudal vertebrae narrow rapidly as they progress farther from the hip, many paleontologists {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries thought that Dimetrodon had a very short tail. It was not until 1927 that a largely complete tail of Dimetrodon was described.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also brought}} out, {{for the first}} time, the burial customs of the Neolithic people. Both human and animal skeletons were found in deep oval shaped pits, located either below the floors of the {{dwelling}} units or in its precincts. These pits were filled with ash, stones and potsherds. Some of the human skulls found here had trepanning (bored hole) marks. In many pits, bones of dogs and antlered deer were found along with human skeletons. The <b>skeletons</b> <b>of</b> humans {{were found in the}} burial pits in a sitting position along with bones of animals.|$|E

5|$|While {{some small}} teeth have been found, few fossilized <b>skeletons</b> <b>of</b> manta rays have been discovered. Their {{cartilaginous}} skeletons do not preserve {{well as they}} lack the calcification of the bony fish. Only three sedimentary beds bearing manta ray fossils are known, one from the Oligocene in South Carolina and two from the Miocene and Pliocene in North Carolina. Remains of an extinct species {{have been found in}} the Chandler Bridge Formation of South Carolina. These were originally described as Manta fragilis but were later reclassified as Paramobula fragilis.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in their skull and teeth, {{it was later}} thought that monkey lemurs (Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur) were a sister group to the living indriids and the recently extinct sloth lemurs (family Palaeopropithecidae). However, there was some debate over whether the monkey lemurs or the sloth lemurs were {{more closely related to}} today's indriids. The monkey lemurs had skulls that more closely resembled the indriids, but their teeth were very specialized and unlike those of the indriids. The sloth lemurs, on the other hand, had teeth like the indriids, but very specialized skulls. The matter was settled with the discovery of new <b>skeletons</b> <b>of</b> Babakotia and Mesopropithecus, two genera of sloth lemur, both of which had indriid-like skulls and teeth. More recently, postcranial remains of Hadropithecus found in the early 2000s prompted the suggestion that the monkey lemurs were more closely related to the lemurids. However, DNA sequencing has reaffirmed the sister group status of the monkey lemurs to indriids and sloth lemurs.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s, most {{researchers}} considered the heterodontosaurids {{as a distinct}} family of primitive ornithischian dinosaurs, but with an uncertain position with respect to other groups within the order. By the early 21st century, the prevailing theories were that the family was the sister group of either the Marginocephalia (which includes pachycephalosaurids and ceratopsians), or the Cerapoda (the former group plus ornithopods), or {{as one of the}} most basal radiations of ornithischians, before the split of the Genasauria (which includes the derived ornithischians). Heterodontosauridae was defined as a clade by Sereno in 1998 and 2005, and the group shares skull features such as three or fewer teeth in each premaxilla, caniniform teeth followed by a diastema, and a jugal horn below the eye. In 2017, similarities between the <b>skeletons</b> <b>of</b> Heterodontosaurus and the early theropod Eoraptor were used to suggest that ornithischians should be grouped with theropods in a group called Ornithoscelida. Traditionally, theropods have been grouped with sauropodomorphs in the group Saurischia.|$|E
